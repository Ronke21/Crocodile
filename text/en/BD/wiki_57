<text>Lava Beds National Monument is located in northeastern California, in Siskiyou and Modoc counties. The monument lies on the northeastern flank of Medicine Lake Volcano, which is the largest volcano by area in the Cascade Range.

The region in and around Lava Beds National Monument lies at the junction of the Sierra-Klamath, Cascade, and Great Basin physiographic provinces. The monument was established as a national monument on November 21, 1925, and includes more than .

Lava Beds National Monument has numerous lava tubes, with 27 having marked entrances and developed trails for public access and exploration. The monument also offers trails through the high Great Basin xeric shrubland desert landscape and the volcanic field. In 1872 and 1873, the area was the site of the Modoc War, involving a band led by Kintpuash (also known as Captain Jack). The area of Captain Jack&#x27;s Stronghold was named in his honor.

==Geologic formations==
Lava Beds National Monument is geologically significant because of its wide variety of volcanic formations, including lava tubes, fumaroles, cinder cones, spatter cones, pit craters, hornitos, maars, lava flows, and volcanic fields.

Volcanic eruptions on the Medicine Lake shield volcano have created a rugged landscape punctuated by these many landforms of volcanism.

=== Cones ===

Cinder cones are formed when magma is under great pressure. It is released in a fountain of lava, blown into the air from a central vent. The lava cools as it falls, forming cinders that pile up around the vent. When the pressure has been relieved, the rest of the lava flows from the base of the cone. Cinder cones are typically monogenetic.

The cinder cones of Hippo Butte, Three Sisters, Juniper Butte, and Crescent Butte are all older than the Mammoth and Modoc Crater flows, more than 30,000–40,000 years old. Eagle Nest Butte and Bearpaw Butte are 114,000 years old. Schonchin Butte cinder cone and the andesitic flow from its base were formed around 62,000 years ago. The flow that formed Valentine Cave erupted 10,850 years ago. An eruption that formed The Castles is younger than the Mammoth Crater flows. Even younger were eruptions from Fleener Chimneys, such as the Devil&#x27;s Homestead flow, 10,500 years ago, and Black Crater 3,025 years ago. About 1,110 years ago, plus or minus 60 years, the Callahan flow was produced by an eruption from Cinder Butte. Though Cinder Butte is just outside the boundary of the monument, the Callahan flow is in Lava Beds and is the youngest flow in the monument.

Spatter cones are built out of thicker lava. The lava is thrown out of the vent and builds, layer by layer, a chimney surrounding the vent. Fleener Chimneys and Black Crater are examples of spatter cones.

=== Lava flows ===
Roughly ninety percent of the lava in the Lava Beds Monument is basaltic. There are primarily two kinds of basaltic lava flows: pahoehoe and ʻaʻā. Pahoehoe is smooth, often ropy and is the most common type of lava in Lava Beds. ʻAʻā is formed when pahoehoe cools and loses some of its gases. ʻAʻā is rough, sharp, and jagged; an excellent example is the Devil&#x27;s Homestead lava flow, which originated at Fleener Chimneys. Most of the rest of the lava in the monument is andesitic. Pumice, a type of rhyolitic lava, also is found covering the monument; this rained down around 900 years ago during the eruption of Glass Mountain.

The flows from Mammoth and Modoc Craters comprise about two-thirds of the lava in the monument. Over 30 separate lava flows located in the park range in age from 2,000,000 years BP to 1,110 years BP. Some of the major lava flows within Lava Beds National Monument include the Callahan Flow; Schonchin Flow; Mammoth Crater Flow; Modoc Crater Flow; and Devil&#x27;s Homestead Flow.

=== Lava fields ===
Gillem Bluff, a fault scarp, was created as the region stretched and a block of earth dropped down along this fault (see Basin and Range Province). The tuff layer on top of Gillem Bluff is 2,000,000 years old, indicating the rock layers beneath are even older. The oldest lava flow from the Medicine Lake Volcano within the monument is the Basalt of Hovey Point, near Captain Jack&#x27;s Stronghold, which is 450,000 years old. Petroglyph Point was created about 275,000 years ago when cinders erupted through the shallow water of Tule Lake; violent explosions of ash and steam formed layers upon layers of tuff.

The caldera is thought to have formed by subsidence, during which basalt and andesite were erupted up on the slopes.

=== Lava tubes ===

Lava flows dated to about 30,000–40,000 years ago formed most of the lava tubes in the monument. As the hot basaltic lava flowed downhill, the top cooled and crusted over, insulating the rest of the lava and forming lava tubes. Lavacicles on the ceiling of a lava tube were produced as the level of lava in the tube retreated and the viscous lava on the ceiling dripped as it cooled.

Dripstone was created when lava splashed on the inside walls of the tubes. The leaching of minerals from pumice gravel, soils, and overlying rock provides for deposition of secondary speleothems in lava tubes.

Lava Beds National Monument has the largest concentration of lava tubes in North America. One has electrical lighting; the others are illuminated by ceiling collapse portals or require flashlights, available on loan.

Notable examples in the park include Catacombs Cave, Merrill Cave, Mushpot Cave, and Valentine Cave.

=== Recent activity ===
A series of small earthquakes in late 1988 has been attributed to subsidence in the caldera. North-northeast trending ground cracks, as well as north-northeast trending vent series show relationships between tectonism and volcanism. One notable ground crack, the Big Crack, extends along the northeastern boundary of the monument.

==Climate==
The high elevation, semi-arid desert environment of Lava Beds National Monument receives an average of of annual precipitation, including of snowfall. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moderately snowy winters. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from in December to in July; there are an average of 23.8 days with + highs annually, and 8.4 days where the high does not rise above freezing. The average window for freezing temperatures is September 20 thru June 6.

==Flora and fauna==

=== Flora ===

The lava tube collapse systems and lava outcrops support a great diversity of plant life, from an impressive variety of lichens and mosses to plants such as desert sweet (&quot;Chamaebatiaria millefolium&quot;), the aromatic purple desert sage (&quot;Salvia dorrii carnosa&quot;) and yellow blazing star (&quot;Mentzelia laevicaulis&quot;).
An impressive variety of fern species are present in cave entrances including the spreading wood fern (&quot;Dryopteris expansa&quot;) and the western swordfern (&quot;Polystichum munitum&quot;). These species are well outside of their normal range, which is west on the northern California coastline.

===Fauna===
Despite harsh, semi-arid conditions, native wildlife has adapted to the environmental constraints present in the region. There are no terrestrial water resources in Lava Beds National Monument. Some animals obtain water from caves, while others fly about twenty km (12 miles) north to Tule Lake. Federal and state animal species of special concern in the Monument include the Cooper&#x27;s hawk (&quot;Accipiter cooperii&quot;), fringed myotis (&quot;Myotis thysanodes&quot;), long-eared myotis (&quot;Myotis evotis&quot;), long-legged myotis (&quot;Myotis volans&quot;), pallid bat (&quot;Antrozous pallidus&quot;), silver-haired bat (&quot;Lasionycteris noctivigans&quot;), Townsends big-eared bat (&quot;Corynorhinus townsendii&quot;), western small-footed myotis (&quot;Myotis ciliolabrum&quot;), and American badger (&quot;Taxidea taxus&quot;).

Because of a lack of surface water, amphibian presence in the monument is limited. The most common species found in the monument is the Pacific tree frog (&quot;Pseudacris regilla&quot;). This species is also found in the biologically rich cave entrances in the monument. Reptile species found in the monument include the northern sagebrush lizard (&quot;Sceloporus graciosus graciosus&quot;), Great Basin fence lizard (&quot;Sceloporus occidentalis biseriatus&quot;), western skink (&quot;Eumeces skiltonianus skiltonianus&quot;), Rocky Mountain rubber boa (&quot;Charina bottae utahensis&quot;), gopher snake (&quot;Pituophis melanoleucus&quot;), desert night snake (&quot;Hypsiglena torquata deserticola&quot;), and western rattlesnake (&quot;Crotalus viridis&quot;).
Key animal species by habitat:
* Bunch grass-sagebrush grasslands: mule deer, gopher snake, coyote, prairie falcon, western meadowlark, Anderson&#x27;s larkspur, yellow-bellied marmot, kangaroo rat
* Ponderosa-juniper brushlands: pronghorn, bobcat, scrub jay, jackrabbit, mountain bluebird,
* Pine forest: mountain lion, bald eagle (winter resident), golden-mantled ground squirrel
* Rocky lava flows: western fence lizard, western rattlesnake
* Cave mouths and interior passages: violet-green swallow, Brazilian free-tailed bat, Townsend&#x27;s big-eared bat, Pacific tree frog, pika, bushy-tailed woodrat
* Lake shore areas: skunk, raccoon, great horned owl, short-eared owl.

==History==

===Archeological site===
Lava Beds National Monument includes Petroglyph Point, one of the largest panels of Native American rock art in the United States. The region was historically occupied by the Modoc people. The Lava Beds National Monument Archeological District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in March 1991.

===Modoc War===
During the Modoc War of 1872–1873, warriors of a band led by Kintpuash (Captain Jack) used the lava beds as a defensive stronghold to resist being captured and returned to the Klamath Reservation in Oregon, to which they had been removed, as European Americans wanted their lands. The Modoc took refuge in a natural lava fortress that was later named Captain Jack&#x27;s Stronghold. From this defensive base, a group of 53 fighting men and their families held off US Army forces, amounting to ten times the Modocs&#x27; population, for five months.

In April 1873, at a peace commission meeting, Captain Jack killed General Edward Canby while associates killed Reverend Eleazer Smith and wounded two other commissioners. Canby was the only casualty of the Indian Wars who had the rank of general at the time of his death. The Modoc mistakenly thought the Americans would leave if their leaders were killed. Instead Army reinforcements were brought in and the Modoc were eventually forced to surrender. Kintpuash and his associates were convicted of war crimes for the murders, and executed by hanging at Fort Klamath.

===Establishment of the monument===

An early steward for the land was J. D. Howard, a miller residing in Klamath Falls. He explored the area intimately beginning in 1917, naming geographic features and making caves accessible. With the area growing attention, he noticed visitors beginning to damage the cave features.

Howard&#x27;s perceived need to preserve the lava tubes and the area&#x27;s other geological features was a major reason why he vigorously pushed for a federally protected status. He would photograph interiors of each cave as part of an effort to persuade people to protect the area. In a letter written in 1923, Howard urged United States Forest Service officials, state legislators, and community leaders to declare the caves a park; &quot;This is the last of Park sites in the States, and is far Superior to all the others as it embraces enough phenomena to keep one busy for at least Three Month Sight Seeing with Cap Jack’s Stronghold to study on leisure hours.&quot;

Howard&#x27;s campaign was successful, as Lava Beds National Monument was signed into existence by President Calvin Coolidge on November 21, 1925. It was created under the auspices of the 1906 Antiquities Act.

===Later expansion===
The only expansion in the modern era occurred in 2011 when the monument expanded by roughly . An administrative transfer brought two parcels of land which were previously managed by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Bureau of Land Management into National Park Service management. These two parcels adjoin the Petroglyph Point Unit of the monument.

==Lava Beds Wilderness==

The Lava Beds National Wilderness is a wilderness area within the Lava Beds National Monument. It was designated by the US Congress on October 13, 1972, with passage of Public Law 92-493.
The wilderness protects more than half of the national monument in two separate eastern and western units. The larger eastern unit contains the extensive Schonchin lava flow on the east side of the monument. The western unit covers the monument&#x27;s area within the transition zone of the Cascade Range&#x27;s montane southern end and the arid Modoc Plateau ecosystems.

The different soil types creates plant community diversity in the wilderness area, providing various habitats for a wide range of wildlife. The numerous coyotes and foxes, as well as raptors, feed on rodents such as the jackrabbit and kangaroo rat. The kangaroo rat is especially adapted to waterless environments because it does not need to drink. It obtains water as a byproduct of the oxidation of nutrients in the seeds it eats.

Many raptors are seen in the wilderness area, with 24 species of hawks identified. The monument is located on the Pacific Flyway, and the bald eagle winters in the northern portion of the wilderness area.

The National Park Service manages the Lava Beds wilderness area and has several restrictions in place. Camping is prohibited near cave entrances or trails. Open campfires may be prohibited during very hot and dry weather.

=== Lava Beds trails ===
The Lava Beds National Monument has 13 hiking trails, all of which cross or enter the backcountry. The most popular trails are short, but lead to a number of historic sites as to several geological areas within the Lava Beds Wilderness. The long trails are mostly in designated wilderness areas.

These trails are primarily associated with park attractions, especially the Lava Beds geological wilderness, and are sometimes out-and-back day hikes, and in many cases are improved boardwalks and supported with interpretive signs and exhibits.

<text>In mathematics, a differential operator is an operator defined as a function of the differentiation operator. It is helpful, as a matter of notation first, to consider differentiation as an abstract operation that accepts a function and returns another function (in the style of a higher-order function in computer science).

This article considers mainly linear differential operators, which are the most common type. However, non-linear differential operators also exist, such as the Schwarzian derivative.

==Definition==
Given a nonnegative integer &quot;m&quot;, an order-formula_1 linear differential operator is a map formula_2 from a function space formula_3 on formula_4 to another function space formula_5 that can be written as:

formula_6

The notation formula_7 is justified (i.e., independent of order of differentiation) because of the symmetry of second derivatives.

The polynomial &quot;p&quot; obtained by replacing partials formula_8 by variables formula_9 in &quot;P&quot; is called the total symbol of &quot;P&quot;; i.e., the total symbol of &quot;P&quot; above is:
formula_10
where formula_11 The highest homogeneous component of the symbol, namely, 
:formula_12
is called the principal symbol of &quot;P&quot;. While the total symbol is not intrinsically defined, the principal symbol is intrinsically defined (i.e., it is a function on the cotangent bundle).

More generally, let &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; be vector bundles over a manifold &quot;X&quot;. Then the linear operator

:formula_13

is a differential operator of order formula_14 if, in local coordinates on &quot;X&quot;, we have 

:formula_15

where, for each multi-index α, formula_16 is a bundle map, symmetric on the indices α.

The &quot;k&quot;th order coefficients of &quot;P&quot; transform as a symmetric tensor

:formula_17

whose domain is the tensor product of the &quot;k&quot;th symmetric power of the cotangent bundle of &quot;X&quot; with &quot;E&quot;, and whose codomain is &quot;F&quot;. This symmetric tensor is known as the principal symbol (or just the symbol) of &quot;P&quot;.

The coordinate system &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; permits a local trivialization of the cotangent bundle by the coordinate differentials d&quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;, which determine fiber coordinates ξ&quot;i&quot;. In terms of a basis of frames &quot;e&quot;μ, &quot;f&quot;ν of &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot;, respectively, the differential operator &quot;P&quot; decomposes into components

:formula_18

on each section &quot;u&quot; of &quot;E&quot;. Here &quot;P&quot;νμ is the scalar differential operator defined by

:formula_19

With this trivialization, the principal symbol can now be written

:formula_20

In the cotangent space over a fixed point &quot;x&quot; of &quot;X&quot;, the symbol formula_21 defines a homogeneous polynomial of degree &quot;k&quot; in formula_22 with values in formula_23.

== Fourier interpretation ==
A differential operator &quot;P&quot; and its symbol appear naturally in connection with the Fourier transform as follows. Let ƒ be a Schwartz function. Then by the inverse Fourier transform,

:formula_24

This exhibits &quot;P&quot; as a Fourier multiplier. A more general class of functions &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,ξ) which satisfy at most polynomial growth conditions in ξ under which this integral is well-behaved comprises the pseudo-differential operators.

==Examples==
*The differential operator formula_25 is elliptic if its symbol is invertible; that is for each nonzero formula_26 the bundle map formula_27 is invertible. On a compact manifold, it follows from the elliptic theory that &quot;P&quot; is a Fredholm operator: it has finite-dimensional kernel and cokernel.
*In the study of hyperbolic and parabolic partial differential equations, zeros of the principal symbol correspond to the characteristics of the partial differential equation.
* In applications to the physical sciences, operators such as the Laplace operator play a major role in setting up and solving partial differential equations.
* In differential topology, the exterior derivative and Lie derivative operators have intrinsic meaning.
* In abstract algebra, the concept of a derivation allows for generalizations of differential operators, which do not require the use of calculus. Frequently such generalizations are employed in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. See also Jet (mathematics).
* In the development of holomorphic functions of a complex variable &quot;z&quot; = &quot;x&quot; + &quot;i&quot; &quot;y&quot;, sometimes a complex function is considered to be a function of two real variables &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. Use is made of the Wirtinger derivatives, which are partial differential operators: formula_28 This approach is also used to study functions of several complex variables and functions of a motor variable.
*The differential operator del, also called &quot;nabla&quot;, is an important vector differential operator. It appears frequently in physics in places like the differential form of Maxwell&#x27;s equations. In three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, del is defined as
:formula_29
:Del defines the gradient, and is used to calculate the curl, divergence, and Laplacian of various objects.
*A chiral differential operator. For now, see 

==History==
The conceptual step of writing a differential operator as something free-standing is attributed to Louis François Antoine Arbogast in 1800.

==Notations==
The most common differential operator is the action of taking the derivative. Common notations for taking the first derivative with respect to a variable &quot;x&quot; include:

: formula_30, formula_31, formula_32 and formula_33.

When taking higher, &quot;n&quot;th order derivatives, the operator may be written:

: formula_34, formula_35, formula_36, or formula_37.

The derivative of a function &quot;f&quot; of an argument &quot;x&quot; is sometimes given as either of the following:

: formula_38
: formula_39

The &quot;D&quot; notation&#x27;s use and creation is credited to Oliver Heaviside, who considered differential operators of the form

: formula_40

in his study of differential equations.

One of the most frequently seen differential operators is the Laplacian operator, defined by

:formula_41

Another differential operator is the Θ operator, or theta operator, defined by

:formula_42

This is sometimes also called the homogeneity operator, because its eigenfunctions are the monomials in &quot;z&quot;:
formula_43

In &quot;n&quot; variables the homogeneity operator is given by
formula_44

As in one variable, the eigenspaces of Θ are the spaces of homogeneous functions. (Euler&#x27;s homogeneous function theorem)

In writing, following common mathematical convention, the argument of a differential operator is usually placed on the right side of the operator itself. Sometimes an alternative notation is used: The result of applying the operator to the function on the left side of the operator and on the right side of the operator, and the difference obtained when applying the differential operator to the functions on both sides, are denoted by arrows as follows:
:formula_45
:formula_46
:formula_47
Such a bidirectional-arrow notation is frequently used for describing the probability current of quantum mechanics.

==Adjoint of an operator==

Given a linear differential operator formula_48
formula_49
the adjoint of this operator is defined as the operator formula_50 such that
formula_51
where the notation formula_52 is used for the scalar product or inner product. This definition therefore depends on the definition of the scalar product (or inner product).

=== Formal adjoint in one variable ===

In the functional space of square-integrable functions on a real interval , the scalar product is defined by
formula_53

where the line over &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) denotes the complex conjugate of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). If one moreover adds the condition that &quot;f&quot; or &quot;g&quot; vanishes as formula_54 and formula_55, one can also define the adjoint of &quot;T&quot; by
formula_56

This formula does not explicitly depend on the definition of the scalar product. It is therefore sometimes chosen as a definition of the adjoint operator. When formula_50 is defined according to this formula, it is called the formal adjoint of &quot;T&quot;.

A (formally) self-adjoint operator is an operator equal to its own (formal) adjoint.

=== Several variables ===

If Ω is a domain in R&quot;n&quot;, and &quot;P&quot; a differential operator on Ω, then the adjoint of &quot;P&quot; is defined in &quot;L&quot;2(Ω) by duality in the analogous manner:

:formula_58

for all smooth &quot;L&quot;2 functions &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;. Since smooth functions are dense in &quot;L&quot;2, this defines the adjoint on a dense subset of &quot;L&quot;2: P* is a densely defined operator.

=== Example ===
The Sturm–Liouville operator is a well-known example of a formal self-adjoint operator. This second-order linear differential operator &quot;L&quot; can be written in the form

: formula_59

This property can be proven using the formal adjoint definition above.

This operator is central to Sturm–Liouville theory where the eigenfunctions (analogues to eigenvectors) of this operator are considered.

==Properties==

Differentiation is linear, i.e.

:formula_60
:formula_61

where &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are functions, and &quot;a&quot; is a constant.

Any polynomial in &quot;D&quot; with function coefficients is also a differential operator. We may also compose differential operators by the rule

:formula_62

Some care is then required: firstly any function coefficients in the operator &quot;D&quot;2 must be differentiable as many times as the application of &quot;D&quot;1 requires. To get a ring of such operators we must assume derivatives of all orders of the coefficients used. Secondly, this ring will not be commutative: an operator &quot;gD&quot; isn&#x27;t the same in general as &quot;Dg&quot;. For example we have the relation basic in quantum mechanics:
:formula_63

The subring of operators that are polynomials in &quot;D&quot; with constant coefficients is, by contrast, commutative. It can be characterised another way: it consists of the translation-invariant operators.

The differential operators also obey the shift theorem.

==Ring of polynomial differential operators==

===Ring of univariate polynomial differential operators===
If &quot;R&quot; is a ring, let formula_64 be the non-commutative polynomial ring over &quot;R&quot; in the variables &quot;D&quot; and &quot;X&quot;, and &quot;I&quot; the two-sided ideal generated by &quot;DX&quot; − &quot;XD&quot; − 1. Then the ring of univariate polynomial differential operators over &quot;R&quot; is the quotient ring formula_65. This is a simple ring. Every element can be written in a unique way as a &quot;R&quot;-linear combination of monomials of the form formula_66. It supports an analogue of Euclidean division of polynomials.

Differential modules over formula_67 (for the standard derivation) can be identified with modules over formula_65.

===Ring of multivariate polynomial differential operators===

If &quot;R&quot; is a ring, let formula_69 be the non-commutative polynomial ring over &quot;R&quot; in the variables formula_70, and &quot;I&quot; the two-sided ideal generated by the elements 
:formula_71
for all formula_72 where formula_73 is Kronecker delta. Then the ring of multivariate polynomial differential operators over &quot;R&quot; is the quotient ring 

This is a simple ring.
Every element can be written in a unique way as a &quot;R&quot;-linear combination of monomials of the form 

==Coordinate-independent description==
In differential geometry and algebraic geometry it is often convenient to have a coordinate-independent description of differential operators between two vector bundles. Let &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; be two vector bundles over a differentiable manifold &quot;M&quot;. An R-linear mapping of sections is said to be a &quot;k&quot;th-order linear differential operator if it factors through the jet bundle &quot;J&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;E&quot;).
In other words, there exists a linear mapping of vector bundles

:formula_74

such that

:formula_75

where is the prolongation that associates to any section of &quot;E&quot; its &quot;k&quot;-jet.

This just means that for a given section &quot;s&quot; of &quot;E&quot;, the value of &quot;P&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) at a point &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;M&quot; is fully determined by the &quot;k&quot;th-order infinitesimal behavior of &quot;s&quot; in &quot;x&quot;. In particular this implies that &quot;P&quot;(&quot;s&quot;)(&quot;x&quot;) is determined by the germ of &quot;s&quot; in &quot;x&quot;, which is expressed by saying that differential operators are local. A foundational result is the Peetre theorem showing that the converse is also true: any (linear) local operator is differential.

===Relation to commutative algebra===
An equivalent, but purely algebraic description of linear differential operators is as follows: an R-linear map &quot;P&quot; is a &quot;k&quot;th-order linear differential operator, if for any &quot;k&quot; + 1 smooth functions formula_76 we have

:formula_77

Here the bracket formula_78 is defined as the commutator

:formula_79

This characterization of linear differential operators shows that they are particular mappings between modules over a commutative algebra, allowing the concept to be seen as a part of commutative algebra.

== Variants ==
===A differential operator of infinite order ===
A differential operator of infinite order is (roughly) a differential operator whose total symbol is a power series instead of a polynomial.

=== Bidifferential operator ===
A differential operator acting on two functions formula_80 is called a bidifferential operator. The notion appears, for instance, in an associative algebra structure on a deformation quantization of a Poisson algebra.

=== Microdifferential operator ===
A microdifferential operator is a type of operator on an open subset of a cotangent bundle, as opposed to an open subset of a manifold. It is obtained by extending the notion of a differential operator to the cotangent bundle.

<text>The Cape teal (Anas capensis) also Cape wigeon or Cape widgeon is a 44–46 cm long dabbling duck of open wetlands in sub-Saharan Africa.

==Taxonomy==

The Cape teal was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the ducks, geese and swans in the genus &quot;Anas&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Anas capensis&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;Cape widgeon&quot; that had been described in 1785 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. The naturalist Joseph Banks had provided Latham with a water-colour drawing of the teal by Georg Forster who had accompanied James Cook on his second voyage to the Pacific Ocean. His picture was drawn in 1773 at the Cape of Good Hope. This picture is now the holotype for the species and is held by the Natural History Museum in London. The genus name &quot;Anas&quot; is the Latin word for a duck. The specific epithet &quot;capensis&quot; indicates the Cape of Good Hope. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
Like many southern ducks, the sexes are similar. It is very pale and mainly grey, with a browner back and pink on the bill (young birds lack the pink). This is a generally quiet species, except during mating displays. The breeding male has a clear whistle, whereas the female has a feeble &quot;quack&quot;. The Cape teal cannot be confused with any other duck in its range.

This species is essentially non-migratory, although it moves opportunistically with the rains. It is a thinly distributed but widespread duck, rarely seen in large groups except the moulting flocks, which may number up to 2000.

The Cape teal feeds on aquatic plants and small creatures (invertebrates, crustaceans and amphibians) obtained by dabbling. The nest is on the ground under vegetation and near water.

The Cape teal is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<doc id="263893" wikidata="Q1617892" url="?curid=263893" title="Tertiary education fees in Australia">
<text>Tertiary education fees in Australia are payable for courses at tertiary education institutions. Responsibility for fees in vocational education and training (VET) rests primarily with the state and territory governments, while fees policy in higher education is largely controlled by the Commonwealth Government.

For most domestic students in higher education, the Commonwealth Government provides loans, subsidies, and/or social security welfare payments &amp; benefits to relieve the cost of tertiary education. These benefits are not available to international students. Some domestic students are supported by the government and are required to pay only part of the cost of tuition, called the &quot;student contribution&quot;, and the government pays the balance. Some government supported students can defer payment of their contribution as a HECS-HELP loan. Other domestic students are full fee-paying (non-Commonwealth supported) and do not receive direct government contribution to the cost of their education. Some domestic students in full fee courses can obtain a FEE-HELP loan from the Australian government up to a lifetime limit of $150,000 for medicine, dentistry and veterinary science programs and $104,440 for all other programs.

Student fees for vocational education vary between jurisdictions, with some states implementing fee-free courses in some fields and all offering some form of government subsidised training. Funding responsibilities for student fee subsidies are agreed between state and territory governments and the Commonwealth under the National Skills Agreement which commenced at the start of 2024.

Australian citizens (and in some cases overseas professionals completing bridging studies in order to be accredited permanent residents) are able to obtain loans from the government under the Higher Education Loan Programme (HELP) which replaced the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS). As of April 2016, the amount of money owed to the Australian government under the HECS scheme was AUD$60 billion and is expected to increase to $180 billion by 2026.

HELP is jointly administered by the Australian Department of Education, Skills and Employment and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). In addition, qualified students may be entitled to Youth Allowance or Austudy Payment to assist them financially while they are studying. These support payments are means and assets tested. Further assistance is available in the form of scholarships. Overseas students are charged fees for the full cost of their education and are ineligible for HELP loans, but may apply for international scholarships.

==History==

In 1940, the Curtin Labor dramatically increased the number of scholarships to increase the number of university graduates and allowed women avail these scholarships as they were previously exclusive to men. In the 1960s, the Menzies Liberal rapidly established new universities, mostly in outlying suburbs, and offered special research scholarships to encourage students to undertake postgraduate research studies. Many of these universities are members of Innovative Research Universities Australia. In 1967, the government created a category of Commonwealth-funded non-university tertiary institution, called College of Advanced Education (CAE), to provide cheaper &amp; easier access to equivalent of bachelor&#x27;s degrees. 

In the 1974 the Whitlam Labor government abolished university fees to make tertiary education in Australia more accessible to working and middle class Australians. In 1989, the Hawke Labor government began gradually re-introducing fees for university study and setup the Higher Education Contributions Scheme (HECS). 

===Present status===
In 1996, the new Howard Coalition government, introduced tiers in the HECS fee structure (now called HECS-HELP). Fees are charged on the basis of the perceived value of courses. Courses considered to have most likelihood of generating higher income for students in the future (e.g. Law and Medicine) are the most expensive and those least likely to generate higher income (e.g. Nursing and Arts) are the least expensive. Since 2007, HECS places are known as Commonwealth Supported Places (CSP). A student in a CSP is only entitled to study for a maximum of 7 years full-time (16 years part-time) at CSP rates. This is known as a Student Learning Entitlement (SLE). After that period the student has to take either a FEE-HELP loan (if available) or study at full-fee rates. If a student receives a HECS-HELP loan, the Commonwealth government pays the loan amount directly to the higher education provider on behalf of the student.

An alternative option is FEE-HELP which provides eligible fee-paying students with a loan to cover their tertiary education fees.

== Commonwealth Supported Places (CSP) &amp; Student Contribution (SC) ==
The Commonwealth government determines the number and allocation of undergraduate &quot;Commonwealth Supported Places&quot; (CSP) with each public higher education provider each year, through the Commonwealth Grant Scheme (CGS). A CSP is a higher education place for which the Commonwealth government makes a contribution to the higher education provider towards the cost of a student&#x27;s education. The student makes a contribution towards the cost of education, known as the &quot;Student Contribution&quot; (SC). Commonwealth supported places are available to citizens of Australia and New Zealand and Australian permanent residents.

The majority of CSPs are managed through the Tertiary Admissions Centre (TACs) in each state or territory, although universities make the selections, deciding which students they will make offers to. 

The allocation is usually based on secondary school results (through the ATAR scores), TAFE qualifications and previous university results.

The student contribution varies between courses, and is based on the expected earnings following a students&#x27; graduation, not the cost of providing the course. Higher education providers can set the student contribution level for each unit of study, up to a maximum level set by the government. It is said that, due to government underfunding of universities, universities almost always charge the highest level allowable.

EFTSL (Equivalent Full-time Student Load) is a measure of a full-time student’s annual study load in terms of minimum number of units (subjects) undertaken by a student in a particular semester, anything less is considered a part-time student.

Between 2012 and 2017, an eligible student who paid the entire or a part of the student contribution upfront received a 10% HECS discount on the amount paid (prior to 2012, the HECS discount was 20%). Only Australian citizens and permanent humanitarian visa holders were eligible for the up-front 10% HECS discount. The up-front discount was removed on 1 January 2017.

=== Total funding ===
The total funding available to institutions per equivalent full-time student is the combination of the student contribution (divided into 3 different amounts/bands) and the Commonwealth government contribution (divided into 8 different amounts/clusters). For 2017, these are:
==Full fee-paying students==
Full fee places for Australian undergraduate students were phased out in 2009 under reforms made by the Gillard government.

Other students may obtain a full fee place (FFP) if they do not receive a Commonwealth supported place, subject to meeting relevant qualifications. Most postgraduate courses do not have Commonwealth supported places available and therefore, all these students are full fee-paying. Fee-paying students are charged the full cost of their course, with no Commonwealth contribution.

Some fee-paying students can obtain loans under the Higher Education Loan Programme, called FEE-HELP loans, to cover all or part of their fees. This is available to Australian citizens, New Zealand citizens and permanent humanitarian visa holders. Undergraduate students who obtain these loans are charged a 20% loan fee on top of the amount borrowed. This does not apply to post graduate courses. Students are able to borrow a lifetime maximum FEE-HELP loan of $112,134 for medicine, dentistry and veterinary science programs and $89,706 for all other programs (adjusted for inflation). In 2005, FEE-HELP loans replaced the Open Learning Deferred Payment Scheme (OLDPS), the Postgraduate Education Loan Scheme (PELS) and the Bridging for Overseas-Trained Professionals Loan Scheme (BOTPLS).

==OS-HELP==

OS-HELP is a loan scheme to assist some undergraduate domestic students to undertake some, but not all, of their course of study overseas. Students are able to obtain a loan up to $6,470 (if the student will not be studying in Asia) or $7764 (if the student will be studying in Asia) for every six months, but can only receive a total of two loans throughout their lifetime. Unlike other loans in the HELP, the loan amount is paid directly to the student and the terms for the loans are set out by the tertiary providers.

As in the FEE-HELP loan scheme, a 20% fee applies on the amount borrowed. This 20% &quot;administration fee&quot; was removed for OS-HELP loans received after January 1, 2010.

==SA-HELP==
SA-HELP loan covers the SSAF (student services and amenities fee). The universities are not allowed to charge more than A$336 per year as SSAF.

==HELP loans==

===HELP loan management===
HELP debts do not attract interest (in the normal sense), but are instead indexed to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on 1 June each year, based on the annual CPI to March of that year. The indexation rate applied on 1 June 2006 was 2.8% and 3.4% on 1 June 2007. Indexation applies to the part of the debt that has been unpaid for 11 months or more. Thus, indexation is calculated on the opening HELP debt balance on 1 July of the previous year plus any debt incurred in the first half of the current year (usually for first semester courses) less any compulsory and voluntary repayments, with bonus. Any HELP debt incurred on second semester courses (usually determined in June) will not be subject to indexation until the next year. After indexation, the new balance is rounded down to a whole dollar amount. Additionally, HELP debts are subject to a 25% fee which does not count towards a student’s HELP debt limit.

As of 1 January 2017 the Commonwealth Government removed the 5% voluntary repayment bonus on all HELP debt repayments.

If a person with an accumulated HELP debt dies, any compulsory repayment included on their income
tax notice of assessment relating to the period prior to their death must be paid
from their estate, but the remainder of their debt is cancelled.

===Repayments===
HELP debts are administered by the Australian Taxation Office and will be repaid compulsorily over time through the taxation system. If the HELP Repayment Income (HRI) of a person with a HELP debt exceeds a certain threshold, which for the 2014/15 financial year is $53,345, a compulsory payments will be deducted from the person&#x27;s tax for the year. The HRI is the person&#x27;s taxable income plus any net rental loss claimed against that taxable income and adding fringe benefits, reportable superannuation contributions and foreign income received, normally exempt from taxation.

Unlike marginal tax rates, the repayment rate applies on the full HRI, so that a person with a HRI below $45,881 in 2019/20 will not need to make a compulsory HELP repayment, but a person with a HRI of $80,000 would make a payment of $4,400. This is 5.5% of the HRI (not taxable income or the debt balance) of $80,000. The compulsory repayment amount cannot exceed the balance of the HELP debt.

The rates for compulsory repayment since 2006 have been:

It is also possible to make voluntary payments to further reduce the debt. Until 31 December 2004 voluntary payments over $500 earned a 15% bonus, from 1 January 2005 this was reduced to 10% and from 1 January 2012 this was reduced to 5%. From 1 January 2017 the Government removed the 5% repayment bonus.

<text>Edward Richard Sprigg Canby (November 9, 1817 – April 11, 1873) was a career United States Army officer and a Union general in the American Civil War. He served as a military governor after the war.

In 1861–1862, Canby commanded the Department of New Mexico, defeating the Confederate General Henry Hopkins Sibley at the Battle of Glorieta Pass, forcing him to retreat to Texas. At the war&#x27;s end, he took the surrender of Generals Richard Taylor and Edmund Kirby Smith. 

As commander of the Pacific Northwest in 1873, he was assassinated by Chief Kintpuash during peace talks with the Modoc, who were refusing to move from their California homelands.

==Early life==
Canby was born in Piatt&#x27;s Landing, Kentucky, to Israel T. and Elizabeth (Piatt) Canby. He attended Wabash College, but transferred to the United States Military Academy, from which he graduated in 1839. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Infantry and served as the regimental adjutant.

Although he was often referred to as Edward Canby, a biographer has suggested that he was known as &quot;Richard&quot; during childhood and to some friends for most of his life. He was called &quot;Sprigg&quot; by fellow cadets at West Point, but during most of his career, he was generally referred to as E.R.S. Canby, sometimes signing his name &quot;Ed. R.S. Canby.&quot;

==Marriage and family==
He married Louisa Hawkins Canby at Crawfordsville, Indiana, August 1, 1839. She came from a family of three sisters and a brother, with whom she remained close. The Canbys had one child, a daughter, who did not survive childhood.

==Early military career==
During his early career, Canby served in the Second Seminole War in Florida and saw combat during the Mexican–American War, where he received three brevet promotions, including to major for Contreras and Churubusco, and lieutenant colonel for Belén Gates. He also served at various posts, including Upstate New York and in the adjutant general&#x27;s office in California from 1849 until 1851, covering the period of the territory&#x27;s transition to statehood.

Against his wishes, he was assigned to what was supposed to be the civilian post of custodian of the California Archives from March 1850 until he left California in April 1851. The Archives included records of Spanish and Mexican governments in California, as well as Mission records and land titles. Evidently, Canby had some knowledge of the Spanish language, which was extremely useful as the government was trying to unravel land titles. (The Filson Historical Society in Louisville, Kentucky holds what appears to be a document written in Canby&#x27;s hand in Spanish, in which he identifies himself as &quot;Edwardo Ricardo S. Canby.&quot;)

Canby served in Wyoming and Utah (then both part of the Utah Territory) during the Utah War (1857–1858). During this period, he served on the panel of judges for the court martial of Captain Henry Hopkins Sibley. Sibley was acquitted. Subsequently, Canby wrote an endorsement for a teepee-like army tent which Sibley had adapted from the American Indian style.

Both officers were later assigned to New Mexico, where in 1860 Canby coordinated a campaign against the Navajo, commanding Sibley in a futile attempt to capture and punish Navajo for &quot;depredations&quot; against the livestock of settlers. The campaign ended in frustration, with Canby and Sibley rarely sighting Navajo raiders. Usually they saw the Navajo at a distance and never got close to them.

==Civil War==
At the start of the Civil War, Canby commanded Fort Defiance, New Mexico Territory. He was promoted to colonel of the 19th U.S. Infantry on May 14, 1861, and the following month commanded the Department of New Mexico. His former assistant Sibley resigned to join the Confederate Army, becoming a Brigadier General. Although Sibley&#x27;s Army of New Mexico defeated Canby and his troops in February 1862 at the Battle of Valverde, Canby eventually forced the Confederates to retreat to Texas after the Union&#x27;s strategic victory at the Battle of Glorieta Pass.

Immediately following this battle, Canby was promoted to brigadier general on March 31, 1862. Recombining the forces he had earlier divided, Canby set off in pursuit of the retreating Confederate forces, but he soon gave up the chase and allowed them to reach Texas. Shortly after the failure of the Confederate invasion of northern New Mexico, Canby was relieved of his command by Gen. James H. Carleton and reassigned to the east.

Canby&#x27;s achievement in New Mexico had largely been in his planning an overall defensive strategy. He and his opponent, Sibley, both had limited resources. Though Canby was a little better supplied, he saw that defending the entire territory from every possible attack would stretch his forces too thinly. Realizing that Sibley had to attack along a river, especially since New Mexico was in the middle of a long drought, Canby made the best use of his forces by defending against only two possible scenarios: an attack along the Rio Grande and an attack by way of the Pecos and Canadian rivers. He could easily shift the latter defensive force to protect Fort Union if the enemy attacked by way of the Rio Grande, which they did. Canby persuaded the governors of both New Mexico and Colorado to raise volunteer units to supplement regular Federal troops; the Colorado troops proved helpful at both Valverde and Glorieta. In spite of occasional superior soldiering by Confederate troops and junior commanders, Sibley&#x27;s sluggishness and vacillation in executing a plan with high risk led to an almost inevitable Confederate collapse.

After a period of clerical duty, Canby was assigned as &quot;commanding general of the city and harbor of New York City&quot; on July 17, 1863. This assignment followed the New York Draft Riots, which caused about 120 deaths and extensive property damage. He served until November 9, reviving the draft, and overseeing a prisoner of war camp in New York Harbor. He then went to work in the office of the Secretary of War, unofficially describing himself in correspondence as an &quot;Assistant Adjutant General.&quot; Looking back on Canby&#x27;s record, a 20th-century adjutant general, Edward F. Witsell, described Canby&#x27;s position as &quot;similar to that of an Assistant to the Secretary of the Army.&quot;

In May 1864, Canby was promoted to major general and relieved Nathaniel P. Banks of his command at Simmesport, Louisiana. He next was assigned to the Midwest, where he commanded the Military Division of Western Mississippi. He was wounded in the upper thigh by a guerrilla while aboard the gunboat &quot;USS Cricket&quot; on the White River in Arkansas near Little Island on November 6, 1864. Canby commanded the Union forces assigned to conduct the campaign against Mobile, Alabama in the spring of 1865. This culminated in the Battle of Fort Blakeley, which led to the fall of Mobile on April 12, 1865. Canby accepted the surrender of the Confederate forces under General Richard Taylor in Citronelle, on May 4, 1865, and those under General Edmund Kirby Smith west of the Mississippi River on May 26, 1865.

Canby was generally regarded as a great administrator, but he was criticized as a soldier. Ulysses S. Grant thought him not aggressive enough. At one time, Grant sent Canby an order to &quot;destroy [the enemy&#x27;s] railroads, machine-shops, &amp;c.&quot; Ten days later, Grant reprimanded him for requesting men and materials to build railroads. &quot;I wrote... urging you to... destroy railroads, machine-shops, &amp;c., not to build them&quot;, Grant said. Canby could be a destroyer but appeared to prefer the role of builder. If someone had a question about army regulations or Constitutional law affecting the military, Canby was the man to see. Grant came to appreciate this in peace time, once complaining vigorously when President Andrew Johnson proposed to assign Canby away from the capital where Grant considered him irreplaceable.

===Central Lunatic Asylum for Colored Insane===
In April 1869, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton appointed General Canby as military governor of Virginia. Soon after Canby arrived in Richmond, he confiscated each of the medical facilities in the city and converted them for use by the Union Army. In the next several months, Canby was made aware of the critical medical and economic plight of thousands of formerly enslaved blacks in the state uprooted by the Civil War. Canby had to decide how to provide blacks access to health and mental health services without violating the racial pecking order that existed in the South. One area in dispute was whether blacks would be allowed admission to the state&#x27;s existing mental asylums at Williamsburg and Staunton. Racial integration of these two asylums had been debated in the legislature and the psychiatric community for over a decade. Dr. John Galt, superintendent of Eastern Lunatic Asylum at Williamsburg believed that free blacks and whites could be treated medically in the same facility as he had demonstrated. However, Dr. Francis Stribling, superintendent of Western Lunatic Asylum at Staunton refused to admit either free or enslaved blacks to his institution. Following the death of Galt, Stribling became chair of an asylum planning committee that advised Canby and the Freedman&#x27;s Bureau on a permanent admission policy for the black population. Stribling proposed that Virginia should construct a separate asylum for the admission and treatment of blacks with lunacy. Canby accepted his recommendation and included it as the basis of his military order number 136, published in December 1869. Canby&#x27;s order required continued utilization of a rented annex at Howard&#x27;s Grove Hospital as the temporary psychiatric hospital for blacks until the state of Virginia could decide whether to maintain and expand it or construct a new facility. In June 1870 the Virginia legislature accepted ownership of the Central Lunatic Asylum for Colored Insane, the first standalone facility in the United States. It remained located at the Howard&#x27;s Grove site until 1885, when a new facility was constructed in Dinwiddie County some 40 miles south of Richmond and renamed Central State Hospital. Canby should be credited with creating the first racially segregated mental hospital in the US for African Americans. The hospital remained segregated by race until passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

==Post-war assignments==
After the war, Canby served as commander of various military departments during Reconstruction, as the government tried to manage dramatic social changes while securing peace. He commanded Louisiana from 1864 to May 1866. He was next assigned as commander of the Department of Washington, which consisted of Delaware, Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Alexandria and Fairfax counties in Virginia, from June 1866 until August 1867. He was assigned to the command of the Second Military District, comprising North and South Carolina. In August 1868, he briefly resumed command in Washington.

He was assigned to the Fifth Military District in November, where he focused primarily on the reconstruction of Texas. He left Texas for Virginia, the First Military District, in April 1869, serving there until July 1870. Each of these postings occurred during Reconstruction and put Canby at the center of conflicts between Republicans and Democrats, whites and blacks, state and federal governments. New state legislatures were writing constitutions, and the social climate was highly volatile, with insurgent attacks against freedmen and Republicans on the rise in numerous areas. Many of his districts had Ku Klux Klan chapters, which the US government was not able to suppress until the early 1870s. Canby sometimes alienated one side or the other and often both. Charles W. Ramsdell called Canby &quot;vigorous and firm, but just.&quot; Even political opponents, such as Jonathan Worth, governor of North Carolina, admitted that Canby was sincere and honest.

==Final assignment and death==
In August 1872, Canby was posted to command the Pacific Northwest. He soon faced problems with the Modoc tribe, who had historically lived in Northern California. Forced to remove to a reservation in Oregon which they had to share with their historical enemies, the Klamath tribe, they had pled with the US government to return to California. When the US refused, the Modoc left the reservation and returned home. In 1872, the US Army went to fight against them to force them back and the Modoc War broke out. The Modoc, entrenched in Captain Jack&#x27;s Stronghold south of Tule Lake, resisted army attacks and fought US forces to a stalemate.

General Canby had received conflicting orders from Washington as to whether to make peace or war on the Modoc. As war was not working, the US government authorized a peace commission and assigned Canby a key position on it. There were many lines of communication between the Modoc and whites. At one point, someone told the Modoc leader Captain Jack that the governor of Oregon intended to hang nine Modoc, apparently without trial, as soon as they surrendered. The Modoc broke off scheduled talks; Canby was angered by the rumors and their action, as he believed that his federal authority trumped the governor&#x27;s and made the threat irrelevant.

On April 11, 1873, after months of false starts and aborted meetings, Canby went to another parley, unarmed and with some hope of final resolution. Judge Elijah Steele of Yreka, California wrote later that when he warned Canby that the Modoc were volatile and he was at risk, Canby replied, &quot;I believe you are right, Mr. Steele, and I shall regard your advice, but it would not be very well for the general in command to be afraid to go where the peace commissioners would venture.&quot; The peace talks were held midway between the army encampment and Captain Jack&#x27;s stronghold near Tule Lake. It was discovered later that two members of Canby&#x27;s party brought concealed weapons and Modoc warriors were also armed. 

According to Jeff C. Riddle, the Modoc son of the US interpreter and the author of &quot;Indian History of the Modoc War&quot; (1914), the Modoc had plotted before the meeting to kill Canby and the other commissioners, as they believed peace was not possible. They were determined to &quot;fight until we die.&quot; (He was the son of &quot;Winema&quot; and Frank Riddle.) Captain Jack had been reluctant to agree to the killings, believing it &quot;coward&#x27;s work&quot;, but was pressured by other warriors to agree. He insisted on being given another chance to ask Canby to &quot;give us a home in our country.&quot; When Canby said he did not have the authority to make such a promise, Captain Jack attacked the general. With Ellen&#x27;s Man, one of his lieutenants, he shot Canby twice in the head and cut his throat. The Modoc also killed Reverend Eleazar Thomas, a peace commissioner, and wounded others in the party.

===Aftermath===

Following Canby&#x27;s death, national outrage was expressed against the Modoc. Eastern newspapers called for blood vengeance, except for one in Georgia, which headlined the story: &quot;Captain Jack and Warriors Revenge the South By Murdering General Canby, One of Her Greatest Oppressors.&quot; E.C. Thomas, son of the murdered peace commissioner, recognized the inevitability of reprisals for the killings, but said: &quot;To be sure, peace will come through war, but not by extermination.&quot; Eventually, Captain Jack (&quot;Kintpuash&quot;), Boston Charley, Schonchin John, Black Jim, Barncho, and Sloluck were tried for &quot;murder in violation of the laws of war&quot;, convicted, and sentenced to death. President Grant commuted the sentences of Barncho and Sloluck to life imprisonment. The other condemned men were all executed on October 3, 1873. The surviving Modoc were sent to reservations. Barncho died in prison in 1875, and Sloluck was released from prison in 1878.

The killing of Canby, and the Great Sioux War, undermined public confidence in President Grant&#x27;s peace policy, according to the historian Robert Utley. There was growing public sentiment for full defeat of the American Indians.

After memorial services were performed on the West Coast, Canby&#x27;s body was returned to Indiana and buried in Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis, Indiana on May 23, 1873. At least four Union generals attended his funeral there: William Tecumseh Sherman, Philip Sheridan, Lew Wallace, and Irvin McDowell, and the latter two served among the pall bearers. A reporter noted that, although the funeral procession was generally reserved, &quot;more than once, expressions of hatred toward the Modoc&quot; marred the silence.

<text>The ruddy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis) is a species of duck in the family Anatidae. The ruddy duck is one of six species within the stiff-tailed ducks (genus &quot;Oxyura&quot;). Stiff-tailed ducks occupy heavily vegetated habitats in North and South America as well as the British Isles, France, and Spain. In the 1940s, the ruddy duck was introduced to the United Kingdom, where it has since established a growing population. Outside the Americas, the ruddy duck is considered a highly invasive species, prompting many countries to initiate culling projects to eradicate it from the native ecosystem.

The generic name is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;oxus&quot; meaning &quot;sharp&quot;, and &quot;oura&quot; meaning &quot;tail&quot;. The specific name &quot;jamaicensis&quot; means &quot;from Jamaica&quot;. The ruddy duck has also been nicknamed &quot;butterball&quot;, a term used to describe an individual that is somewhat fat, due to its short and stout stature making activities like flying and walking upright awkward.

==Taxonomy==
The ruddy duck was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the other ducks, geese and swans in the genus &quot;Anas&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Anas jamaicensis&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;Jamaica shoveler&quot; that had been described in 1785 by the English ornithologist John Latham from a specimen that he had received from Jamaica. The ruddy duck is now placed with five other species in the genus &quot;Oxyura&quot; that was introduced in 1828 by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte. The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;oxus&quot;, meaning &quot;sharp&quot;, and &quot;oura&quot; meaning &quot;tail&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;jamaicensis&quot; means &quot;from Jamaica&quot;. The Andean duck was formerly considered to be conspecific with the ruddy duck but with the two species split, the ruddy duck is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==

The ruddy duck is a small, compact duck with a stout, scoop-shaped bill, and a long, stiff tail which it holds cocked upward. It has a slightly peaked head and a fairly short, thick neck. The male ruddy duck has a blackish cap that contrasts with its bright white cheeks. In summer, it has a rich chestnut body with a bright blue bill. In winter, it is a dull gray-brown above and paler below with a dull gray bill. The female and first-year male are brownish, somewhat like the winter male but with a blurry stripe across the pale cheek patch. In flight, the ruddy duck shows the solidly dark tops of the wings. On average, the female is smaller and weighs less than the male.

It has a short and stout scoop-shaped bill designed for underwater foraging. With its short stature, it is known to be a great swimmer whilst finding taking flight a much more laboured task. In comparison to other ducks, ruddy ducks rarely fly but when they do, it is done with a very fast wingbeat and closely over the water. 

An interesting physical feature found within this taxon of duck is the trachea, inflatable air sacs, and esophagi which are used in displays. The tail of the ruddy duck is commonly seen held upwards. 

== Vocalizations ==
Both male and female ruddy ducks are not known to be very vocal most of the year, though they do become more vocal when courting and raising young. Males are known to produce short &quot;aa-anh&quot; calls and other noises in short bursts. Female ruddy ducks have a much higher pitched call, often having a &quot;raanh&quot; sound when communicating with their brood, squeaks when chased by males, and hisses and nasal sounds towards intruders.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

=== Breeding and habits ===

Unlike other migratory anatine courtship where partnerships occur in wintering grounds, ruddy ducks often begin courtship on the breeding ground. Both male and female ruddy ducks have been observed interacting aggressively with each other but despite aggression, pairs can be seen loafing next to each other minutes later. Their breeding habitat is marshy lakes and ponds. 

Both male and females are not known to be very vocal with quacks, though males are known to produce a distinct drumming sound by beating their lower mandible on their breast. This drumming beat is done hard enough that often swirls of bubbles will appear in the water. This display is known as &quot;bubbling&quot;. In an aggressive response, the male faces his rival while performing bubbling. In courting, a bubbling male orientates his body laterally to the female. In a group of courting birds of more than one male, the males typically display rapidly alternating forms of bubbling in accordance with constantly and suddenly changing aggressive and sexual responses. In courting gestures females mostly respond to the male’s advances.

They nest in dense marsh vegetation near water. The female builds the nest out of grass, locating it in tall vegetation to hide it from predators. A typical brood contains 5 to 15 ducklings. Pairs form each year. Though ruddy ducks can have large broods, the male normally takes no part in rearing. The female will incubate the eggs for 23–26 days whilst being protected by her mate. After the young hatch, it only takes about a month or two until they are fully ready to fly but as a result of the young being independent very quickly, they often stray from the rest of the brood. Females will care for her young but never for the entire period of the fledgling.

Female ruddy ducks have been observed acting in brood parasitism. There hasn’t been a clear factor that influences females to lay their eggs in other nests. Though it was observed that parasitic eggs were more likely to be male than female hatchlings. Though some suspect that the parasitic laying is directly tied to the lack of attunement between the female ruddy duck and the environmental cues.

They are migratory and winter in coastal bays and unfrozen lakes and ponds.

=== Feeding ===
Ruddy ducks mainly feed on a large amount of plant matter like seeds and roots as well as aquatic insects and crustaceans. A large portion of the animal matter consumed is larvae and pupae. During the winter, they often consume a higher amount of animal food. The food foraged is done underwater, an activity that the ruddy duck excels at. They forage by straining food from the surface of the substrate, moving their bills side to side whilst opening and closing their mandibles. This allows their food to stay caught in between their bill whilst the substrate is filtered out. 

Due to all foraging occurring with substrate clouding the water, the way ruddy ducks select their prey is not through visuals. Instead, ruddy ducks use tactile location of the larvae and pupae to forage. Ruddy ducks can also feed on small molluscs and crustaceans like bivalves and amphipods. They are able to find these organisms in moving waters by using the tip of their bill as it has many sensory endings which direct the duck towards their food. The slight crooked shape of their mandible also allows them to efficiently tear at plant matter underwater.

When searching for randomly placed food patches, Ruddy Ducks sampled previously profitable sites before investigating other areas more frequently than would be expected by chance. Revisiting previously profitable foraging sites may be important when exploiting a patchy food resource with prey densities that are likely to be quickly replenished after having been exploited.

==Invasive species/Cull==
As a result of escapes from wildfowl collections in the late 1950s, they became established in Great Britain, from where they spread into Europe. This duck&#x27;s aggressive courting behavior and willingness to interbreed with the endangered native white-headed duck (&quot;Oxyura leucocephala&quot;), of southern Europe, caused concern amongst Spanish conservationists. Due to this, a controversial scheme to extirpate the ruddy duck as a British breeding species started; there have also been culling attempts in other European countries.

By March 2012 a culling program in the UK, supported by the RSPB, had killed 6,500, at a cost of £5m (£769 per bird). In 2003 the BBC had reported the cost of killing each bird at £915. In 2012 Lee Evans, founder of the British Birding Association, claimed &quot;The cull cannot succeed now. There are hundreds of ruddy ducks on the continent which will not be killed so the birds will continue to breed. There&#x27;s never been any proof, anyway, that the British population has ever interbred with the Spanish ducks&quot;. By early 2014, the cull had reduced the British population to about 20–100, down from a peak of about 5,500 in 2000.
According to Animal Aid, in the UK the cost of hunting down the last few ruddy ducks was £3,000 per bird. They advised &quot;If you see one, don’t tell anyone. Even bird groups will tell the authorities and those birds may be killed&quot;.

In Europe, the ruddy duck is included since 2016 in the list of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern (the Union list). That implies the species cannot be imported, bred, transported, commercialized, or intentionally released into the environment in the whole of the European Union.

<doc id="263902" wikidata="Q1341668" url="?curid=263902" title="Evanescent field">
<text>In electromagnetics, an evanescent field, or evanescent wave, is an oscillating electric and/or magnetic field that does not propagate as an electromagnetic wave but whose energy is spatially concentrated in the vicinity of the source (oscillating charges and currents). Even when there is a propagating electromagnetic wave produced (e.g., by a transmitting antenna), one can still identify as an evanescent field the component of the electric or magnetic field that cannot be attributed to the propagating wave observed at a distance of many wavelengths (such as the far field of a transmitting antenna).

A hallmark of an evanescent field is that there is no net energy flow in that region. Since the net flow of electromagnetic energy is given by the average Poynting vector, this means that the Poynting vector in these regions, as averaged over a complete oscillation cycle, is zero.

== Use of the term ==
In many cases one cannot simply say that a field is or is not &quot;evanescent&quot; – having the Poynting vector average to zero in some direction (or all directions).
In most cases where they exist, evanescent fields are simply thought of and referred to the same as all other electric or magnetic fields involved, without any special recognition of those fields&#x27; evanescence. The term&#x27;s use is mostly limited to distinguishing a part of a field or solution in those cases where one might only expect the fields of a propagating wave.

For instance, in the illustration at the top of the article, energy is indeed carried in the horizontal direction. However, in the vertical direction, the field strength drops off exponentially with increasing distance above the surface. This leaves most of the field concentrated in a thin boundary layer very close to the interface; for that reason, it is referred to as a &quot;surface wave&quot;. However, despite energy flowing horizontally, along the vertical there is &quot;no&quot; net propagation of energy &quot;away&quot; from (or toward) the surface, so that one could properly describe the field as being &quot;evanescent in the vertical direction&quot;. This is one example of the context dependence of the term.

Everyday electronic devices and electrical appliances are surrounded by large fields which are evanescent; their operation involves alternating voltages (producing an electric field between them) and alternating currents (producing a magnetic field around them) which are expected to only carry power along internal wires, but not to the outsides of the devices. Even though the term &quot;evanescent&quot; is not mentioned in this ordinary context, the appliances&#x27; designers still may be concerned with &quot;maintaining&quot; evanescence, in order to prevent or limit production of a propagating electromagnetic wave, which would lead to radiation loss, since a propagating wave &quot;steals&quot; its power from the circuitry or donates unwanted interference.

The term &quot;evanescent field&quot; &quot;does&quot; arise in various contexts where a propagating electromagnetic wave is involved (even if confined). The term then differentiates electromagnetic field components that accompany the propagating wave, but which do not themselves propagate. In other, similar cases, where a propagating electromagnetic wave would normally be expected (such as light refracted at the interface between glass and air), the term is invoked to describe that part of the field where the wave is suppressed (such as light traveling through glass, impinging on a glass-to-air interface but beyond the critical angle).

Although all electromagnetic fields are classically governed according to Maxwell&#x27;s equations, different technologies or problems have certain types of expected solutions, and when the primary solutions involve wave propagation the term &quot;evanescent&quot; is frequently applied to field components or solutions which do not share that property.

For instance, the propagation constant of a hollow metal waveguide is a strong function of frequency (a dispersion relation). Below a certain frequency (the cut-off frequency) the propagation constant becomes an imaginary number. A solution to the wave equation having an imaginary wavenumber does &quot;not&quot; propagate as a wave but falls off exponentially, so the field excited at that lower frequency is considered evanescent. It can also be simply said that propagation is &quot;disallowed&quot; for that frequency.

The formal solution to the wave equation can describe modes having an identical form, but the change of the propagation constant from real to imaginary as the frequency drops below the cut-off frequency totally changes the physical nature of the result. The solution may be described as a &quot;cut-off mode&quot; or an &quot;evanescent mode&quot;; while a different author will just state that no such mode exists. Since the evanescent field corresponding to the mode was computed as a solution to the wave equation, it is often discussed as being an &quot;evanescent wave&quot; even though its properties (such as carrying no energy) are inconsistent with the definition of wave.

Although this article concentrates on electromagnetics, the term &quot;evanescent&quot; is used similarly in fields such as acoustics and quantum mechanics, where the wave equation arises from the physics involved. In these cases, solutions to the wave equation resulting in imaginary propagation constants are likewise called &quot;evanescent&quot;, and have the essential property that no net energy is transferred, even though there is a non-zero field.

== Evanescent wave applications ==
In optics and acoustics, evanescent waves are formed when waves traveling in a medium undergo total internal reflection at its boundary because they strike it at an angle greater than the &quot;critical angle&quot;. The physical explanation for the existence of the evanescent wave is that the electric and magnetic fields (or pressure gradients, in the case of acoustical waves) cannot be discontinuous at a boundary, as would be the case if there was no evanescent wave field. In quantum mechanics, the physical explanation is exactly analogous—the Schrödinger wave-function representing particle motion normal to the boundary cannot be discontinuous at the boundary.

Electromagnetic evanescent waves have been used to exert optical radiation pressure on small particles to trap them for experimentation, or to cool them to very low temperatures, and to illuminate very small objects such as biological cells or single protein and DNA molecules for microscopy (as in the total internal reflection fluorescence microscope). The evanescent wave from an optical fiber can be used in a gas sensor, and evanescent waves figure in the infrared spectroscopy technique known as attenuated total reflectance.

In electrical engineering, evanescent waves are found in the near-field region within one third of a wavelength of any radio antenna. During normal operation, an antenna emits electromagnetic fields into the surrounding nearfield region, and a portion of the field energy is reabsorbed, while the remainder is radiated as EM waves.

Recently, a graphene-based Bragg grating (one-dimensional photonic crystal) has been fabricated and demonstrated its competence for excitation of surface electromagnetic waves in the periodic structure using a prism coupling technique.

In quantum mechanics, the evanescent-wave solutions of the Schrödinger equation give rise to the phenomenon of wave-mechanical tunneling.

In microscopy, systems that capture the information contained in evanescent waves can be used to create super-resolution images. Matter radiates both propagating and evanescent electromagnetic waves. Conventional optical systems capture only the information in the propagating waves and hence are subject to the diffraction limit. Systems that capture the information contained in evanescent waves, such as the superlens and near field scanning optical microscopy, can overcome the diffraction limit; however these systems are then limited by the system&#x27;s ability to accurately capture the evanescent waves. The limitation on their resolution is given by
: formula_1

where formula_2 is the maximal wave vector that can be resolved, formula_3 is the distance between the object and the sensor, and formula_4 is a measure of the quality of the sensor.

More generally, practical applications of evanescent waves can be classified as (1) those in which the energy associated with the wave is used to excite some other phenomenon within the region of space where the original traveling wave becomes evanescent (for example, as in the total internal reflection fluorescence microscope) or (2) those in which the evanescent wave couples two media in which traveling waves are allowed, and hence permits the transfer of energy or a particle between the media (depending on the wave equation in use), even though no traveling-wave solutions are allowed in the region of space between the two media. An example of this is &quot;wave-mechanical tunnelling&quot;, and is known generally as &quot;evanescent wave coupling&quot;.

== Total internal reflection of light ==

For example, consider total internal reflection in two dimensions, with the interface between the media lying on the x axis, the normal along y, and the polarization along z. One might expect that for angles leading to total internal reflection, the solution would consist of an incident wave and a reflected wave, with no transmitted wave at all, but there is no such solution that obeys Maxwell&#x27;s equations. Maxwell&#x27;s equations in a dielectric medium impose a boundary condition of continuity for the components of the fields &quot;E||, H||, Dy&quot;, and &quot;By&quot;. For the polarization considered in this example, the conditions on &quot;E||&quot; and &quot;By&quot; are satisfied if the reflected wave has the same amplitude as the incident one, because these components of the incident and reflected waves superimpose destructively. Their &quot;Hx&quot; components, however, superimpose constructively, so there can be no solution without a non-vanishing transmitted wave. The transmitted wave cannot, however, be a sinusoidal wave, since it would then transport energy away from the boundary, but since the incident and reflected waves have equal energy, this would violate conservation of energy. We therefore conclude that the transmitted wave must be a non-vanishing solution to Maxwell&#x27;s equations that is not a traveling wave, and the only such solutions in a dielectric are those that decay exponentially: evanescent waves.

Mathematically, evanescent waves can be characterized by a wave vector where one or more of the vector&#x27;s components has an imaginary value. Because the vector has imaginary components, it may have a magnitude that is less than its real components.

For the plane of incidence as the formula_5 plane at formula_6 and the interface of the two mediums as the formula_7 plane at formula_8, the wave vector of the transmitted wave has the form
:formula_9
with formula_10 and formula_11, where formula_12 is the magnitude of the wave vector of the transmitted wave (so the wavenumber), formula_13 is the angle of refraction, and formula_14 and formula_15 are the unit vectors along the formula_16 axis direction and the formula_17 axis direction respectively.

By using the Snell&#x27;s law formula_18 where formula_19, formula_20, and formula_21 are the refractive index of the medium where the incident wave and the reflected wave exist, the refractive index of the medium where the transmitted wave exists, and the angle of incidence respectively,
:formula_22.
with formula_23.

If a part of the condition of the total internal reflection as formula_24, is satisfied, then
:formula_25.
If the polarization is perpendicular to the plane of incidence (along the formula_26 direction), then the electric field of any of the waves (incident, reflected, or transmitted) can be expressed as

:formula_27

where formula_28 is the unit vector in the formula_26 axis direction.

By assuming plane waves as formula_30, and substituting the transmitted wave vector formula_31 into formula_32, we find for the transmitted wave:

:formula_33

where formula_34 is the attenuation constant, and formula_35 is the phase constant. formula_36 is ignored since it does not physically make sense (the wave amplification along &quot;y&quot; the direction in this case).

== Evanescent-wave coupling ==

Especially in optics, &quot;evanescent-wave coupling&quot; refers to the coupling between two waves due to physical overlap of what would otherwise be described as the evanescent fields corresponding to the propagating waves.

One classical example is frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) in which the evanescent field very close (see graph) to the surface of a dense medium at which a wave normally undergoes total internal reflection overlaps another dense medium in the vicinity. This disrupts the totality of the reflection, diverting some power into the second medium.

Coupling between two optical waveguides may be effected by placing the fiber cores close together so that the evanescent field generated by one element excites a wave in the other fiber. This is used to produce fiber-optic splitters and in fiber tapping. At radio (and even optical) frequencies, such a device is called a directional coupler. The device is usually called a power divider in the case of microwave transmission and modulation.

Evanescent-wave coupling is synonymous with near field interaction in electromagnetic field theory. Depending on the nature of the source element, the evanescent field involved is either predominantly electric (capacitive) or magnetic (inductive), unlike (propagating) waves in the far field where these components are connected (identical phase, in the ratio of the impedance of free space). The evanescent wave coupling takes place in the non-radiative field near each medium and as such is always associated with matter; i.e., with the induced currents and charges within a partially reflecting surface. In quantum mechanics the wave function interaction may be discussed in terms of particles and described as quantum tunneling.

=== Applications ===
Evanescent wave coupling is commonly used in photonic and nanophotonic devices as waveguide sensors or couplers (see e.g., prism coupler).

Evanescent wave coupling is used to excite, for example, dielectric microsphere resonators.

Evanescent coupling, as near field interaction, is one of the concerns in electromagnetic compatibility.

Coupling of optical fibers without loss for fiber tapping.

Evanescent wave coupling plays a major role in the theoretical explanation of extraordinary optical transmission.

Evanescent wave coupling is used in powering devices wirelessly.

A total internal reflection fluorescence microscope uses the evanescent wave produced by total internal reflection to excite fluorophores close to a surface. This is useful when surface properties of biological samples need to be studied.

<text>An escrow is a contractual arrangement in which a third party (the stakeholder or escrow agent) receives and disburses money or property for the primary transacting parties, with the disbursement dependent on conditions agreed to by the transacting parties. Examples include an account established by a broker for holding funds on behalf of the broker&#x27;s principal or some other person until the consummation or termination of a transaction; or, a trust account held in the borrower&#x27;s name to pay obligations such as property taxes and insurance premiums. The word derives from the Old French word , meaning a scrap of paper or a scroll of parchment; this indicated the deed that a third party held until a transaction was completed.

==Types==
Escrow generally refers to money held by a third party on behalf of transacting parties. It is mostly used regarding the purchase of shares of a company. It is best known in the United States in the context of the real estate industry (specifically in mortgages where the mortgage company establishes an escrow account to pay property tax and insurance during the term of the mortgage). Escrow is an account separate from the mortgage account where deposit of funds occurs for payment of certain conditions that apply to the mortgage, usually property taxes and insurance. The escrow agent has the duty to properly account for the escrow funds and ensure that usage of funds is explicitly for the purpose intended. Since a mortgage lender is not willing to take the risk that a homeowner may not pay property tax, escrow is usually required under the mortgage terms. 

Escrow companies are also commonly used in the transfer of high value personal and business property, like websites and businesses, and in the completion of person-to-person remote auctions (such as eBay), although the advent of new low-cost online escrow services has meant that even low-cost transactions are now starting to benefit from use of escrow. 

In the UK, escrow accounts are often used during private property transactions to hold solicitors&#x27; clients&#x27; money, such as the deposit, until such time as the transaction completes. Other examples include:
* Purchases of a second-hand car, where the money is held in the name of the buyer in a temporary bank account
* Deposits for a property rental, where the money is released after the tenant moves out
* Provision of construction services, where the money may be released when the building work is complete to a defined standard or when defined parts of the work are completed

===Internet escrow===
Internet escrow has existed since the beginning of Internet auctions and commerce. It was one of the many developments that allowed trust to be established in the online sphere.

As with traditional escrow, Internet escrow works by placing money in the control of an independent and licensed third party in order to protect both the buyer and seller in a transaction. When both parties verify the transaction has been completed per terms set, the money is released. If at any point there is a dispute between the parties in the transaction, the process moves along to dispute resolution. The outcome of the dispute resolution process will decide what happens to money in escrow. With the growth of both business and individual commerce on the web, traditional escrow companies have been supplanted by new technologies.

In the US, the California Department of Business Oversight enacted Internet escrow companies as a licensed class effective 1 July 2001. The first Internet escrow company to be licensed was Escrow.com, founded by Fidelity National Financial in 1999.

In the European Union, the Payment Services Directive, which commenced on 1 November 2009, has for the first time allowed the introduction of very low-cost Internet escrow services that are properly licensed and government-regulated. The regulatory framework in the EU allows these web-based escrow services, which operate along the lines of expensive letter of credit service run by banks for international buyers and sellers but at a cost in cents rather than thousands of Euros, the ability to enhance security in commercial transactions.

Bogus escrow methods have been employed online. In an effort to persuade a wary Internet auction participant, the perpetrator will propose the use of a third-party escrow service. The victim is unaware that the perpetrator has actually created an escrow site that closely resembles a legitimate escrow service. The victim sends payment to the fraudulent escrow company and ends up receiving nothing in return. Alternatively, a victim may send merchandise to the subject and waits for his/her payment through the escrow site, which is never received because it is illegitimate. Genuine online escrow companies will be listed on a government register, and users are generally advised not to use an online escrow service without first verifying that it is genuine by independently viewing a government on-line register. Currently, the US Federal Government does not offer a license for online escrow services. However, certain states offer their own license for online escrow services; such as the California Department of Business and the Arizona Department of Financial Institutions.

===Banking===
Escrow is used in the field of automatic banking and vending equipment. One example is automated teller machines (ATMs), and is the function which allows the machine to hold the money deposited by the customer separately, and in case he or she challenges the counting result, the money is returned. Another example is a vending machine, where the customer&#x27;s money is held in a separate escrow area pending successful completion of the transaction. If a problem occurs and the customer presses the refund button, the coins are returned from escrow; if no problem occurs, they fall into the coin vault of the machine.

===Intellectual property===
Source code escrow agents hold source code of software in escrow just as other escrow companies hold cash. Sometimes one may not own or have any rights to the software (including source code) that they are accessing under the terms of a regular SaaS or desktop software agreement. This arrangement does not usually become an issue until technical problems start to arise, i.e. unexpected service interruptions, downtime, loss of application functionality and loss of data. This can add significant costs to one&#x27;s business, as they remain reliant upon the software supplier to resolve these issues, unless an escrow agreement is in place. Escrow is when the software source code is held by a third party—an escrow agent—on behalf of the customer and the supplier. Information escrow agents, such as the International Creative Registry, hold in escrow intellectual property and other information. Examples include song music and lyrics, manufacturing designs and laboratory notebooks, and television and movie treatments and scripts. This is done to establish legal ownership rights, with the independent escrow agents attesting to the information&#x27;s ownership, contents, and creation date.

===Law===
Escrow is also known in the judicial context. So-called escrow funds are commonly used to distribute money from a cash settlement in a class action or environmental enforcement action. This way the defendant is not responsible for distribution of judgment monies to the individual plaintiffs or the court-determined use (such as environmental remediation or mitigation). The defendant pays the total amount of the judgment (or settlement) to the court-administered or appointed escrow fund, and the fund distributes the money (often reimbursing its expenses from the judgment funds).

===Real estate===
In the US, escrow payment is a common term referring to the portion of a mortgage payment that is designated to pay for real property taxes and hazard insurance. It is an amount &quot;over and above&quot; the principal and interest portion of a mortgage payment. Since the escrow payment is used to pay taxes and insurance, it is referred to as &quot;T&amp;I&quot;, while the mortgage payment consisting of principal and interest is called &quot;P&amp;I&quot;. The sum total of all elements is then referred to as &quot;PITI&quot;, for &quot;Principal, Interest, Tax, and Insurance&quot;. Some mortgage companies require customers to maintain an escrow account that pays the property taxes and hazard insurance. Others offer it as an option for customers. Some types of loans, most notably Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, require the lender to maintain an escrow account for the life of the loan.

Even with a fixed interest rate, monthly mortgage payments may change over the life of the loan due to changes in property taxes and insurance premiums. For instance, if a hazard insurance premium increases by $120 per year, the escrow payment will need to increase by $10 per month to account for this difference (in addition to collection for the resulting escrow shortage when the mortgage company paid $120 more for the hazard insurance premium than what was anticipated). By RESPA guidelines the escrow payment must be recomputed at least once every 12 months to account for increases in property taxes or insurance. This is called an escrow analysis.

The escrow payment used to pay taxes and insurance is a long-term escrow account that may last for years or for the life of the loan. Escrow can also refer to a shorter-term account used to facilitate the closing of a real estate transaction. In this type of escrow, the escrow company holds all documents and money related to closing the transaction, rather than having the buyer and the seller deal directly with each other. When and if the transaction is ready to close, the escrow company distributes all funds and documents to their rightful recipients, and records the deed with the appropriate authorities.

Courts sometimes act as stakeholders, holding property while litigation between the possible owners resolves the issue in which one is entitled to the property.

===Mergers and acquisitions===
Escrow arrangement is often used as a part of mergers and acquisitions a supplement that warranties and indemnities offered by the seller(s). This will be particularly likely where the credit risk of the seller(s) is of poor quality and the buyer is concerned about their ability to recover any sums that may become due.

Unlike many other forms of escrow, escrow arrangements in corporate transactions are often designed to last for extended periods rather than simply to complete the transfer of an asset. There is also commonly the requirement for an escrow agent to adjudicate on the validity of a claim on the escrow funds, which can lead to the risk of the dispute between the parties.

Due to the length that the funds are held, the escrow arrangements need to take into account different considerations to those for other escrow arrangements, for example (i) information provision to the parties; (ii) application of interest earned on the funds; and (iii) credit worthiness of the financial institution.

===Gambling===
For example, two people may bet on the outcome of a future event. They ask a third, disinterested, neutral person—the stakeholder—to hold the money (&quot;stakes&quot;) they have wagered (&quot;staked&quot;). After the event occurs, the stakeholder distributes the stakes to one or both of the original (or other) parties according to the outcome of the event and according to the previously decided conditions. Trustees also often act as stakeholders, holding property until beneficiaries come of age, for example.

==Legal implications==
Not all escrow agreements impose the duties of a legal trustee on the escrow agent, and in many such agreements, escrow agents are held to a mere gross negligence standard and benefit from indemnity and hold harmless provisions.

If the escrow agent is licensed by governmental authority, then much higher legal standards may apply.

<doc id="263909" wikidata="Q1427463" url="?curid=263909" title="Laugh track">
<text>A laugh track (or laughter track) is an audio recording consisting of laughter (and other audience reactions) usually used as a separate soundtrack for comedy productions. The laugh track may contain live audience reactions or artificial laughter (canned laughter or fake laughter) made to be inserted into the show, or a combination of the two. The use of canned laughter to &quot;sweeten&quot; the laugh track was pioneered by American sound engineer Charles &quot;Charley&quot; Douglass.

The Douglass laugh track became a standard in mainstream television in the U.S., dominating most prime-time sitcoms and sketch comedies from the late 1950s to the late 1970s. Use of the Douglass laughter decreased by the 1980s upon the development of stereophonic laughter. In addition, single-camera sitcoms eliminated audiences altogether. Canned laughter is used to encourage the viewer to laugh. 

==History in the United States==

===Radio===
Before radio and television, audiences experienced live comedy performances in the presence of other audience members. Radio and early television producers used recordings of live shows and later studio-only shows attempted to recreate this atmosphere by introducing the sound of laughter or other crowd reactions into the soundtrack.

Jack Dadswell, former owner of WWJB in Florida, created the first &quot;laughing record&quot;.

In 1946, Jack Mullin brought a Magnetophon magnetic tape recorder back from Radio Frankfurt, along with 50 reels of tape; the recorder was one of the magnetic tape recorders that BASF and AEG had built in Germany starting in 1935. The 6.5 mm tape could record 20 minutes per reel of high-quality analog audio sound; Alexander M. Poniatoff then ordered his Ampex company to manufacture an improved version of the Magnetophon for use in radio production. Bing Crosby eventually adopted the technology to pre-record his radio show, which was scheduled for a certain time every week, to avoid having to perform the show live, as well as having to perform it a second time for West Coast audiences.

With the introduction of this recording method, it became possible to add sounds during post-production. Longtime engineer and recording pioneer Jack Mullin explained how the laugh track was invented on Crosby&#x27;s show:
===Early live U.S. television, film; &quot;sweetening&quot;===
In early television, most shows that were not broadcast live used the single-camera filmmaking technique, where a show was created by filming each scene several times from different camera angles. Whereas the performances of the actors and crew could be controlled, live audiences could not be relied upon to laugh at the &quot;correct&quot; moments; other times, audiences were deemed to have laughed too loudly or for too long.

CBS sound engineer Charley Douglass noticed these inconsistencies, and took it upon himself to remedy the situation. If a joke did not get the desired chuckle, Douglass inserted additional laughter; if the live audience chuckled too long, Douglass gradually muted the guffaws. This editing technique became known as sweetening, in which recorded laughter is used to augment the response of the real studio audience if they did not react as strongly as desired. Conversely, the process could be used to &quot;desweeten&quot; audience reactions, toning down unwanted loud laughter or removing inappropriate applause, thus making the laughter more in line with the producer&#x27;s preferred method of telling the story.

While still working for CBS, Douglass built a prototype laugh machine that consisted of a large, wooden wheel 28 inches in diameter with a reel of tape glued to the outer edge of it containing recordings of mild laughs. The machine was operated by a key that played until it hit another detent on the wheel, thus playing a complete laugh. Because it was constructed on company time, CBS demanded possession of the machine when Douglass decided to terminate his time with them. The prototype machine fell apart within months of use. Douglass developed an expansion of his technique in 1953 when he began to extract laughter and applause from live soundtracks recorded (mainly from the pantomime segments of &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;), and then placed the recorded sounds into a huge tape machine.

These recorded laughs could be added to single-camera filmed programs. The first American television show to incorporate a laugh track was the sitcom &quot;The Hank McCune Show&quot; in 1950. Other single-camera filmed shows, like &quot;The Pride of the Family&quot; (ABC, 1953–54), soon followed suit, though several, like &quot;The Trouble with Father&quot; (ABC, 1950–55), &quot;The Beulah Show&quot; (ABC, 1950–52) and &quot;The Goldbergs&quot; (several networks, 1949–56), did not feature an audience or a laugh-track. &quot;Four Star Playhouse&quot;, an anthology series, did not utilize a laugh-track or audience on its occasional comedy episodes, with co-producer David Niven calling the laugh track &quot;wild indiscriminate mirth&quot; and stating that &quot;I shall blackball the notion if it ever comes up. Not that it will. We shall carry on without mechanical tricks&quot;.

====Multi-camera shows====
Soon after the rise of the laugh track, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz devised a method of filming with a live audience using a setup of multiple film cameras. This process was originally employed for their sitcom &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, which used a live studio audience and no laugh track. Multi-camera shows with live audiences sometimes used recorded laughs to supplement responses. Sketch comedy and variety shows eventually migrated from live broadcasting to videotape, which allowed for editing before a show was aired. Physically editing a taped audience show (then using quadruplex videotape) before electronic dubbing arrived caused bumps and gaps on the soundtrack; Douglass was then called upon to bridge these gaps.

Both performers and producers gradually began to realize the power behind prerecorded laughter. While witnessing an early post-production editing session, comedian Milton Berle once pointed out a particular joke and said, &quot;as long as we&#x27;re here doing this, that joke didn&#x27;t get the response we wanted&quot;. After Douglass inserted a hearty laugh following the failed joke, Berle reportedly commented, &quot;See? I told you it was funny&quot;. The comedian Bob Hope, while working on one of his television specials, took Douglass&#x27;s hands in his own and began rubbing them to create the effect of limbering up Douglass&#x27;s fingers, saying &quot;OK, now, give me some good laughs.&quot;

===1960s===
As the medium evolved, production costs associated with broadcasting live television escalated. Filming in a studio with an audience, as &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; or &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; did, had its limitations as well: half the audience could not see the show from where they were sitting. Douglass was brought in to simulate reactions from scratch for the duration of the entire show. Producers soon realized how much simpler it was to film a show without an audience present and tailor the reactions during post-production. Directors initially did not allow space for inserting reactions, making sweetening difficult and resulted in dialogue being drowned out. Audience response cards repeatedly came back saying that laughter seemed forced or contrived. Writers gradually became more conscious of the space required for the laugh track and began timing their scripts around it. Directors gradually left room for as-yet-unheard audience reactions; producers budgeted for post-production so Douglass could edit with greater ease.

Most television sitcoms produced during the 1950s and 1960s used the single-camera technique, with a laugh track simulating the absent audience. Producers became disenchanted with the multi-camera format; consensus at the time was that live audiences were tense, nervous and rarely laughed on cue.

====&quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;====

Network research indicated that the inclusion of a laugh track was considered essential for categorizing a single-camera show as a comedy. This hypothesis was tested in 1965 when CBS conducted an experiment involving its new single-camera sitcom &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; (1965-71), presenting two versions of the pilot episode to test audiences: one with a laugh track and one without. The version without the laugh track, due in part to the show&#x27;s more cerebral humor, performed poorly, while the version with the laugh track garnered a more favorable reception. Consequently, &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; was broadcast with the laugh track, and CBS subsequently incorporated laugh tracks into all of its comedic programming.

Sitcom laugh tracks differed, depending on the style of the show. The more outlandish the show, the more invasive the laugh track. Shows like &quot;Bewitched&quot;, &quot;The Munsters&quot;, &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; and &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; relied heavily on laugh tracks, while more subdued programs, like &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; and &quot;My Three Sons&quot;, had more modulated laughter. Certain shows, like &quot;Get Smart&quot;, featured a laugh track that became more invasive as the series progressed, while shows like &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; toned down the laughter as the series became more dramatic; it was entirely absent during operating room scenes.

By the mid-1960s, nearly every U.S. sitcom was shot using the single camera and was fitted with a laughter track. Only a handful of programs, such as &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot;, &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; and &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; used studio audiences but augmented the real laughter via &quot;sweetening.&quot;

===Charley Douglass and the mysterious &quot;laff box&quot;===
From the late 1950s to the early 1970s, Douglass had a monopoly on the expensive and painstaking laugh business. By 1960, nearly every prime time show in the U.S. was sweetened by Douglass. When it came time to &quot;lay in the laughs&quot;, the producer directed Douglass where and when to insert the type of laugh requested. Inevitably, disagreements arose between Douglass and the producer, but the producer had final say. After taking his directive, Douglass went to work at creating the audience, out of sight from the producer or anyone else present at the studio.

Critic Dick Hobson commented in a July 1966 &quot;TV Guide&quot; article that the Douglass family were &quot;the only laugh game in town.&quot; Very few in the industry ever witnessed Douglass using his invention, as he was notoriously secretive about his work, and was one of the most talked-about men in the television industry.

Douglass formed Northridge Electronics in August 1960, named after the Los Angeles suburb in the San Fernando Valley where the Douglass family resided and operated their business in a padlocked garage. When their services were needed, they wheeled the device into the editing room, plugged it in, and went to work. Production studios became accustomed to seeing Douglass shuttling from studio to studio to mix in his manufactured laughs during post-production.

The technological advancements pioneered by Douglass closely resembled those found in musical instruments such as the Chamberlain Music Master and Mellotron. His sophisticated one-of-a-kind device – affectionately known in the industry as the &quot;laff box&quot; – was tightly secured with padlocks, stood more than two feet tall, and operated like an organ. Douglass used a keyboard similar to that of a typewriter to select the corresponding style, gender and age of the laugh as well as a pedal to time the length of the reaction. Inside the machine was a wide array of recorded chuckles, yocks and belly laughs: 320 laughs on 32 tape loops, ten to a loop. Each loop contained up to ten individual audience laughs spliced end-to-end, whirling around simultaneously waiting to be cued up. Since the tapes were looped, laughs were played in the same order repeatedly. Sound engineers could watch sitcoms and knew exactly which recurrent guffaws were next, even if they were viewing an episode for the first time. Douglass frequently combined different laughs, either long or short in length. Attentive viewers could spot when he decided to mix chuckles together to give the effect of a more diverse audience. Rather than being simple recordings of a laughing audience, Douglass&#x27;s laughs were carefully generated and mixed, giving some laughs detailed identities such as &quot;the guy who gets the joke early&quot; and &quot;housewife giggles&quot; and &quot;the one who didn&#x27;t get the joke but is laughing anyway&quot; all blended and layered to create the illusion of a real audience responding to the show in question. A man&#x27;s deep laugh would be switched for a new woman&#x27;s laugh, or a high-pitched woman&#x27;s giggle would be replaced with a man&#x27;s snicker. One producer noticed a recurrent laugh of a woman whom he called &quot;the jungle lady&quot; because of her high-pitched shriek. After regularly complaining to Douglass, the laugh was retired from the regular lineup.

There was also a 30-second &quot;titter&quot; track in the loop, which consisted of individual people laughing quietly. This &quot;titter&quot; track was used to quiet down a laugh and was always playing in the background. When Douglass inserted a hearty laugh, he increased the volume of the titter track to smooth out the final mix. This titter track was expanded to 45 seconds in 1967, later to 60 seconds in 1970, and received overhauls in 1964, 1967, 1970, and 1976. Douglass kept recordings fresh, making minor changes every few months, believing that the viewing audience evolved over time. Douglass also had an array of audience clapping, &quot;oohs&quot; and &quot;ahhhs,&quot; as well as people moving in their seats (which many producers insisted be constantly audible).

Only immediate members of the family knew what the inside of the device looked like (at one time, the &quot;laff box&quot; was called &quot;the most sought after but well-concealed box in the world&quot;). More than one member of the Douglass family was involved in the editing process, and each reacted to a joke differently. Charley Douglass was the most conservative of all, so producers often put in bids for Charley&#x27;s son Bob, who was more liberal in his choice of laughter. Subtle textural changes could have enormous consequences for the ethical situation suggested by a laugh track.
Douglass knew his material well, as he had compiled it himself. He had dozens of reactions, and he knew where to find each one. Douglass regularly slightly sped up the laughter to heighten the effect. His work was well appreciated by many in the television industry. Over the years, Douglass added new recordings and revived old ones that had been retired and then retired the newer tracks. Laughter heard in sitcoms of the early 1960s resurfaced years later in the late 1970s. Especially starting in the 1970s, Douglass started alternating the updated laugh track with an older laugh track and even sometimes combined the two together. Up to 40 different laugh clips could be combined and layered at one time, creating the effect of a larger, louder reaction when in fact the same laughs were later heard individually. As the civil rights movement gained momentum, Douglass also started making his laugh track more diverse, including examples of laughter of people from other cultures, whose sounds were noticeably different from white Americans.

Douglass&#x27;s &quot;laff box&quot; was purchased, unseen, at auction in 2010 when its owner failed to pay rent on the storage locker where it was housed. It was later discussed, and demonstrated in a June 2010 episode of &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; from San Diego, California, where its value was appraised at $10,000.

===Cartoons and children&#x27;s shows===
The integration of laugh tracks extended beyond live-action programming to include select prime-time animated television series during the mid-20th century. This trend commenced notably with &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot; (ABC, 1959–61; NBC, 1961–64), albeit restricted to the initial four episodes of the series. Subsequent to this pioneering endeavor, Hanna-Barbera adopted a similar approach, incorporating comprehensive laugh tracks into its prime-time animated productions until approximately 1970.

Noteworthy examples of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s utilization of laugh tracks encompassed acclaimed series such as &quot;The Flintstones&quot; (ABC, 1960–66), &quot;Top Cat&quot; (ABC, 1961–62), and &quot;The Jetsons&quot; (ABC, 1962–63). Additionally, supplementary productions including Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s mid-summer sitcom, &quot;Where&#x27;s Huddles?&quot; (CBS, 1970), and Krayo Creston and MCA&#x27;s &quot;Calvin and the Colonel&quot; (ABC, 1961–62), featured analogous employment of laugh tracks. The incorporation of laugh tracks extended further into midday programming, exemplified by &quot;The Banana Splits Adventure Hour&quot; (NBC, 1968–70), gradually aligning with prevailing industry practices.

From the late 1960s through the early 1980s, a substantial proportion of comedic cartoons tailored for the Saturday morning genre embraced the inclusion of laugh tracks. This trend was inaugurated with the debut of Filmation&#x27;s &quot;The Archie Show&quot; in 1968, subsequently emulated by industry stalwarts such as Rankin-Bass, DePatie–Freleng Enterprises (DFE), and Hanna-Barbera. However, as the proliferation of laugh tracks grew pervasive, diminishing their novelty and efficacy, animation studios gradually relinquished their reliance on this auditory embellishment by the early 1980s. The denouement of this era was marked by the conclusion of Filmation&#x27;s &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Planet&quot; (CBS, 1982–83), which stands as the culminating animated Saturday-morning series to feature the inclusion of a laugh track within its framework.

Given its midday time slot, &quot;The Banana Splits&quot; served as a precursor to Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s utilization of Charles Douglass&#x27;s laugh track technology in animated programming aired during Saturday morning hours. This transition commenced with the debut of &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot; (CBS, 1969–70) in 1969, marking the inaugural incorporation of Douglass&#x27;s laugh track within Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s Saturday morning lineup. Encouraged by the favorable reception of this innovation, Hanna-Barbera proceeded to integrate the laugh track into the majority of its productions for the 1970–71 season. This expansion of the laugh track&#x27;s usage encompassed a broad spectrum of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s animated offerings, including series such as &quot;Harlem Globetrotters&quot; (CBS, 1970–71) and &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; (CBS, 1970–71). Such strategic deployment of Douglass&#x27;s technology mirrored Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s commitment to enhancing the comedic appeal and viewer engagement of its animated content during the pivotal Saturday morning programming block.

&quot;The Pink Panther Show&quot; (NBC, 1969–1978; ABC, 1978–1980) was something of an anomaly among its peers. Comprising a compilation of previous theatrical releases, the show adopted a format featuring half-hour showcases, amalgamating various DFE theatrical shorts such as &quot;The Inspector&quot;, &quot;The Ant and the Aardvark&quot; and &quot;The Tijuana Toads&quot; (rebranded as &quot;The Texas Toads&quot; for television broadcasts due to perceived cultural sensitivities). Notably, the original theatrical versions of these shorts did not incorporate laugh tracks. However, NBC mandated the inclusion of such audio elements for television airing. Consequently, laugh tracks were added to adapt the content for broadcast, a decision driven by network preferences and perceived audience expectations. Subsequently, in 1982, when the DFE theatrical package entered syndication, efforts were undertaken to restore the soundtracks to their original state, aligning with the artistic integrity of the source material. Over time, the repackaging of these shorts has led to the availability of both theatrical and television versions, preserving the diverse auditory experiences associated with each iteration. Exceptions to this trend include &quot;Misterjaw&quot; and &quot;Crazylegs Crane&quot;, which were exclusively produced for television and never subjected to theatrical releases, resulting in versions characterized solely by the presence of laughter tracks.

Following the precedent set by Filmation, producers Sid and Marty Krofft adopted Douglass&#x27;s laugh track technology for their television productions. The pivotal moment occurred with the commencement of production on &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot; in 1969, when executive producer Si Rose advocated for the inclusion of a laugh track, considering any comedy devoid of such augmentation as inherently disadvantaged. This persuasion led to the incorporation of Douglass&#x27;s laugh track into &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf,&quot; setting the stage for its integration into subsequent Krofft productions tailored for Saturday morning television.

Subsequently, the Kroffts enlisted Douglass&#x27;s services for all their Saturday morning television ventures, excluding the more dramatically oriented &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; series. This collaborative endeavor extended to a range of productions, including &quot;The Bugaloos&quot;, &quot;Lidsville&quot;, &quot;Sigmund and the Sea Monsters&quot;, &quot;The Lost Saucer&quot; and &quot;Far Out Space Nuts&quot;. Transitioning from high-concept children&#x27;s programming to live variety shows, the Kroffts continued their collaboration with Douglass for audio sweetening purposes. Notable variety shows benefiting from Douglass&#x27;s expertise include &quot;Donny and Marie&quot;, &quot;The Brady Bunch Variety Hour&quot;, &quot;The Krofft Supershow&quot;, &quot;The Krofft Superstar Hour&quot;, &quot;Pink Lady and Jeff&quot;, &quot;Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters&quot;, &quot;Pryor&#x27;s Place&quot;, as well as their 1987 syndicated sitcom &quot;D.C. Follies&quot;.

As the practice of incorporating laugh tracks into Saturday morning television programming gained traction, Douglass expanded his repertoire to include a variety of children&#x27;s laughter. Referred to as &quot;kiddie laughs,&quot; these additions to his sound library were first utilized for audio enhancement in the 1973 syndicated television special, &quot;The World of Sid and Marty Krofft at the Hollywood Bowl&quot;, but by 1974, were heard on most Saturday morning kids&#x27; shows such as &quot;Uncle Croc&#x27;s Block&quot;, &quot;Sigmund and the Sea Monsters&quot;, &quot;The Pink Panther Show&quot;, &quot;The Lost Saucer&quot; and &quot;Far Out Space Nuts&quot;.

Current Disney Channel-produced sitcoms and studio-created laugh tracks are primarily recorded in front of live audiences. Nickelodeon – Disney&#x27;s top competitor – utilizes a laugh track for shows such as &quot;iCarly&quot; and &quot;Victorious&quot; since closing the original studio facilities fitted for live audience seating.

====Making their own====
By the onset of 1970, Charles Douglass&#x27;s enterprise in laugh production had become increasingly profitable, prompting a decision to adjust the pricing structure for his services. However, the economic landscape of animated television programming differed significantly from that of sitcoms, characterized by tighter budgetary constraints. In response to the imperative of cost reduction, animation studios, notably Hanna-Barbera and Rankin-Bass, commenced a gradual disengagement from Douglass&#x27;s services beginning in 1971.

While acknowledging the necessity of incorporating laughter tracks into their productions, these studios sought alternative methods to procure chuckles, employing diverse strategies to compile custom laugh tracks independently. The adoption of such proprietary laugh tracks elicited considerable controversy within contemporary discourse and among historical commentators, who raised questions regarding their authenticity and aesthetic congruence.

Nevertheless, amidst this shifting landscape, entities such as Filmation, DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, and Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Television Productions maintained their collaborative alliances with Douglass, continuing to enlist his expertise for the augmentation of laughter in their Saturday-morning animated content.

====Hanna-Barbera====
Hanna-Barbera, a pioneering force in American cartoon production, marked a significant departure from its utilization of Douglass&#x27;s services. The studio embraced the laugh track phenomenon, initially integrating it into their prime-time lineup comprising acclaimed shows such as &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, &quot;Top Cat&quot;, and &quot;The Jetsons&quot;. Subsequently, this practice extended to their daytime programming, notably with the introduction of &quot;The Banana Splits&quot; in 1968, drawing inspiration from Filmation&#x27;s &quot;The Archies&quot;. Prior to 1971, successful series such as &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot;, &quot;Harlem Globetrotters&quot;, and &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; were characterized by the pervasive presence of a comprehensive laugh track.

A pivotal shift occurred at the outset of the 1971–72 season when Hanna-Barbera adopted a nuanced approach by implementing a limited laugh track mechanism employing the MacKenzie Repeater machine. This device, capable of cyclically playing up to five sound effects, facilitated the repetition of Douglass&#x27;s distinctive laughs. The auditory composition featured a blend of mild chuckles and hearty belly-laughs, occasionally accentuated by a prominent female laugh, all augmented by a metallic resonance. With the exception of their eclectic variety shows, exemplified by &quot;The Hanna-Barbera Happy Hour&quot;, which briefly reverted to Douglass for additional enhancements, Hanna-Barbera standardized the use of this modified laugh track across the majority of their Saturday morning programming throughout the ensuing decade.

The impact of the Hanna-Barbera laugh track extended beyond episodic content to various television specials, notably those featured within &quot;The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie&quot; (ABC, 1972–74), functioning as a platform for the introduction of prospective comedic cartoon series. Occasionally, the studio employed techniques such as deceleration of the laugh track to heighten its comedic effect, as exemplified by the second season of &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot;.

In 1972, Hanna-Barbera continued its experimentation with laugh track dynamics with the production of &quot;Wait Till Your Father Gets Home&quot;. Notably, this endeavor featured a modified laugh track distinguished by the inclusion of an additional belly laugh, a distinctive departure from their standard practice. Moreover, the laugh track in this instance underwent a deliberate reduction in speed during the production process, marking a singular occurrence within Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s television repertoire.

The Hanna-Barbera laugh track was discontinued after the 1981–82 television season.

In 1994, laugh track historian and re-recording mixer Paul Iverson commented on the legacy of the Hanna-Barbera track:
 Iverson added:
====Rankin/Bass====
Rankin/Bass, a notable animation studio renowned predominantly for their Christmas-themed specials, ventured into the realm of incorporating a laugh track into their Saturday morning animated series &quot;The Jackson 5ive&quot; in 1971. Following a model akin to that of Hanna-Barbera, Rankin/Bass adopted a methodology involving the extraction of laughter samples from Charles Douglass&#x27;s extensive library, integrating them seamlessly into the program&#x27;s audio track.

Initially, the laughter segments featured unmodulated bursts of sound, rendering their application somewhat discordant; instances of subdued humor prompted disproportionately robust reactions, often disrupting the natural flow of the narrative. Additionally, there were instances where laughter would spontaneously erupt mid-dialogue, further undermining the comedic effect.

However, the studio exhibited a commitment to refining their approach, evident in their second season endeavors. Through meticulous curation from Douglass&#x27;s updated 1971–72 library, Rankin/Bass introduced more nuanced and contextually appropriate laughter segments. Notably, the improved selection was characterized by a greater degree of modulation, ensuring a more harmonious integration with the program&#x27;s comedic timing. Sound engineering enhancements undertaken by Rankin/Bass further contributed to the optimization of the laugh track&#x27;s synchronization with the animated sequences.

This enhanced methodology was not confined solely to &quot;The Jackson 5ive&quot;; concurrently, it was also applied to another Rankin/Bass production, &quot;The Osmonds&quot; (ABC, 1972). Diverging from the metallic tonality often associated with Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s laugh track, Rankin/Bass endeavored to provide a more diverse array of laughter samples, thereby enriching the auditory experience for viewers.

Ultimately, the utilization of the laugh track by Rankin/Bass was temporally constrained, ceasing upon the conclusion of production for the aforementioned series. This decision marked the culmination of the studio&#x27;s experimentation with this particular aspect of audio enhancement within the context of their television productions.

====Jim Henson &amp; Associates: &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;====
The transition from the preliminary &quot;silent&quot; pilots to the official series of &quot;The Muppet Show &quot; marked a departure in comedic presentation. Incorporating a laugh track into the show&#x27;s framework, albeit in a unique manner, distinguished it from its predecessors. Embracing the vaudevillian essence inherent in the variety program, viewers were not only treated to the antics of The Muppets but also to glimpses of the theater audience and their reactions.

Situated at the ATV Elstree Studios in England, the production team, under the guidance of Jim Henson, took measures to ensure a distinct auditory experience. Departing from the pre-recorded laughs of previous ventures, fresh chuckles and applause were meticulously curated for initial episodes, often sourced from the authentic reactions of cast and crew members to dailies. This novel approach not only lent an aura of authenticity but also cultivated a perception among viewers that the show was performed before a live audience. Despite this illusion, Henson acknowledged the impracticality of a live audience given the complexities of production, drawing parallels to similar challenges faced by other television productions. Henson noted that because of the series&#x27; vaudeville inspiration, having sounds of laughter was a necessity, but admits that it was not an easy task – &quot;I look at some of the early shows, I&#x27;m really embarrassed by them. The sweetening got better later on, but it&#x27;s always a difficult thing to do well, and to create the reality of the audience laughing.&quot;

The incorporation of a laugh track was not devoid of skepticism. Henson initially harbored reservations about its compatibility with the Muppet series, experimenting with both dry and laughter-enhanced versions of the pilot episode before conceding to its efficacy in amplifying comedic impact. The utilization of the laugh track became a distinctive feature of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, occasionally acknowledged within the narrative by characters breaking the fourth wall. In the fourth episode of the series, Kermit the Frog was asked by guest Ruth Buzzi if he felt a gag or routine was funny enough for the show, to which he turned to the camera and replied, &quot;That&#x27;s up to the laugh track.&quot; A season two episode featuring guest Steve Martin eschewed a laugh track altogether to support the concept that the show had been canceled that night in favor of auditioning new acts; the only audible laughs were those of the Muppet performers themselves.

Following the conclusion of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; in 1981, subsequent Muppet projects saw a shift in production locales to the United States. This relocation was prompted by the cessation of the commercial ATV franchise in the UK and the disassociation of Lord Lew Grade, the show&#x27;s financier, from television ventures. In the absence of Henson&#x27;s original laugh track, subsequent projects turned to the expertise of Douglass for audience reactions, a tradition continued by his son Robert in subsequent Muppet endeavors, including special one-shot productions like &quot;The Fantastic Miss Piggy Show&quot; and &quot;The Muppets: A Celebration of 30 Years&quot;, and &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot; under Disney&#x27;s auspices.

===1970s; Comeback of live audiences===
The use of canned laughter peaked in the 1960s. However, some producers felt uncomfortable managing a sitcom that wasn&#x27;t designed to be filmed in front of a live audience. One such example was &quot;Lucy&quot; veteran and Lucille Ball&#x27;s ex-husband Desi Arnaz, who was more familiar with live sitcoms, as he had previously co-produced &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. In mirroring Ball&#x27;s successful comeback in &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; and &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, Arnaz produced &quot;The Mothers-in-Law&quot; (NBC, 1967–69), which was recorded in front of a live audience at Desilu Studios, but still hired Douglass to augment a sweetened track in post-production. A year later, &quot;The Good Guys&quot; (CBS, 1968–70) attempted to follow the same format. Although the first few episodes were filmed live, changes in production and location forced the crew to drop using multiple cameras for the remainder of the first season, using only a laugh track. This continued through season two until low ratings led to its cancellation in 1970.

Another show that started being taped partially in front of a live audience was George Schlatter&#x27;s sketch comedy &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; (NBC, 1968–73), as well as its rival &quot;Hee-Haw&quot; (CBS, 1969–71, Syndication, 1971–93). &quot;Laugh-In&quot; became an enigma among other comedic shows of the time in terms of its production methods; the 1967 pilot and the first few episodes of the first season featured a studio audience to react to the comedy routines of the ensemble on-stage, while pre-recorded shots mainly used Douglass&#x27; laugh track. Eventually, as marathon taping sessions of the show became increasingly expensive, Schlatter no longer required audiences to attend the tapings. Instead, cast relatives, the crew, people who still opted to attend, and the cast themselves, composed the studio audience, and the show relied more on Douglass&#x27; laugh track. Douglass would even simulate the reactions of the audience and diversify these chuckles with the track. He would continue to use this effect until the show&#x27;s end in 1973, and for earlier seasons of &quot;Hee-Haw&quot;.

Other shows that continued bucking the trend against the single-camera method was Lucille&#x27;s Ball next incarnate sitcom, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; (CBS, 1968–74). Unlike other sitcoms of the era, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; became one of the first sitcoms to embrace the social and cultural zeitgeist of the late 1960s, featuring guest stars ranging from the older guard of Hollywood to pop and rock musicians and athletes (e.g. Joe Namath, Donny Osmond, and Petula Clark). With focusing more on episodes revolving around a more urban setting, it ushered in what CBS had sought out to do by the turn of the 1970s.

The 1970s began with the decline of rural-based shows (such as &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, &quot;Green Acres&quot; and &quot;Mayberry RFD&quot;) and the rise of socially conscious programming (such as &quot;All in the Family&quot;, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and &quot;Maude&quot;). What prompted CBS to revamp its new image was the success of the sitcom &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; and its new emerging hit, &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; (CBS, 1970–77). The series&#x27; pilot episode, &quot;Love is All Around&quot;, had been initially filmed using the single-camera method. The results were not satisfactory to Moore or the producers, who then decided to shift to multiple cameras. Since the first several episodes were taped in late summer, the pilot&#x27;s first taping was not received well due to bad insulation and poor audio. The second taping, however, provided better air conditioning and a better quality sound system to the stage. Critical reception thus improved, and the show used the multi-camera format thereafter, and became a major success during its seven-year run.

The resurgence of live audiences began to gradually take hold. More sitcoms began to veer away from the single-camera, movie-style format, reverting to the multi-camera format with a live studio audience providing real laughter, which producers found more pleasing because it had a better comic rhythm and helped them write better jokes. Creator Norman Lear&#x27;s &quot;All in the Family&quot; (CBS, 1971–1979) followed suit in 1971. Videotaped live, Lear was more spontaneous; he wanted the studio audience to act like the performer, with hopes of the two developing a rapport with each other. Lear was not a fan of pretaped audiences, resulting in no laugh track being employed, not even during post-production when Lear could have had the luxury of sweetening any failed jokes (Lear relented somewhat in later seasons, and allowed Douglass to insert an occasional laugh). Lear&#x27;s decision resulted in the show being a huge success, and ushered in the return of live audiences to the U.S. sitcom mainstream. To make his point clear, an announcement proclaimed over the closing credits each week that &quot;&quot;All in the Family&quot; was recorded on tape before a live audience&quot; or during the show&#x27;s final seasons where live audiences no longer attended tapings of the show, &quot;&quot;All in the Family&quot; was played to a studio audience for live responses.&quot;

Jack Klugman and Tony Randall expressed displeasure during the first season of &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; (ABC, 1970–75), which used a laugh track without a live audience. Co-creator/executive producer Garry Marshall also disliked utilizing a laugh track, and theatre veteran Randall, in particular, resented the process of having to wait several seconds between punchlines in order to allot enough space for the laugh track to be inserted. The production team experimented with omitting the laugh track altogether with the episode &quot;Oscar&#x27;s New Life&quot;; the episode aired without a laugh track (laughter was subsequently added for syndication in order to maintain continuity). ABC relented by the second season, with &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; being filmed with three cameras (vs. a single camera the previous season) and performed like a stage play in front of a studio audience. The change also required a new, larger set to be constructed within a theatre. With a live audience present, Randall and Klugman enjoyed the spontaneity that came with it; any missed or blown lines went by without stopping (they could always be re-filmed during post-production). In addition, it gave the show a certain edge that was seen as missing in the first season, although actors had to deliver lines louder, since they were on a larger sound stage as opposed to a quiet studio with only minimal crew present. Klugman later commented, &quot;We spent three days rehearsing the show. We sat around a table the first day. We tore the script apart. We took out all the jokes and put in character. The only reason we leave in any jokes is for the rotten canned laughter. I hated it. I watch the shows at home, I see Oscar come in and he says, &#x27;Hi,&#x27; and there is the laughter. &#x27;Hey,&#x27; I think, &#x27;what the hell did I do?&#x27; I hate it; it insults the audience.&quot;

The sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot; (ABC, 1974–84) mirrored &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; scenario as well. Its first two seasons used only a laugh track, and by third season, shifted over to a live audience.

The shows were not entirely live, however. With the exception of &quot;All in the Family&quot;, sweetening was still a necessity during post-production in order to bridge any gaps in audience reactions. Television/laugh track historian Ben Glenn II observed a taping of the sitcom &quot;Alice&quot; (CBS, 1976–85) and noted the need for sweetening: &quot;The actors kept blowing their lines. Of course, by the third or fourth take, the joke was no longer funny. A Douglass laugh was inserted into the final broadcast version to compensate.&quot;

Some producers, like James Komack, however, followed Lear&#x27;s approach. Komack, who was involved in the short-lived sitcom &quot;Hennesey&quot; starring Jackie Cooper, was a longtime critic of the Douglass laugh track, believing the laughs were too predictable and could hinder the effect of the sitcom&#x27;s humor. Komack instead employed music to counteract the sweetened laughs. He experimented with this technique in &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot; (ABC, 1969–72), which featured a subdued laugh track. Multi-camera shows produced by Komack, such as &quot;Chico and the Man&quot; (NBC, 1974–78) and &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot; (ABC, 1975–79), utilized background music cues during scene transitions (obvious locations for sweetening) and made sure that Douglass&#x27;s laugh track was used infrequently during post-production. Komack later commented, &quot;If you ever try to do a show without a laugh track, you&#x27;ll see a huge difference...[I]t flattens. The only way to get away from a laugh track is to use music, which can indicate when something is funny.&quot; On sweetening, he continued, &quot;Then it&#x27;s determined by the taste of the producers – by the morality of the producers...[A]fter a while, you learn that it is valueless. In the extremes, people are going to hear it and say, &#x27;Why are they laughing?&#x27; and they&#x27;ll turn off your program.&quot;

In addition to &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; and &quot;Happy Days&quot;, other live sitcoms that were sweetened by Douglass (many of which also sweetened by Pratt by the end of the 1970s) were &quot;The Paul Lynde Show&quot; (ABC, 1972–73), &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; (CBS, 1972–78), &quot;Maude&quot; (CBS, 1972–78), &quot;Rhoda&quot; (CBS, 1974–78), &quot;Barney Miller&quot; (ABC, 1975–82), &quot;Laverne and Shirley&quot; (ABC, 1976–83), &quot;Soap&quot; (ABC, 1977–81), &quot;The Comedy Shop&quot; (Syndication, 1978–81), &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; (ABC, 1978–82), &quot;Taxi&quot; (ABC, 1978–82; NBC, 1982–83), &quot;Cheers&quot; (NBC, 1982–93) and its spinoff &quot;Frasier&quot; (NBC, 1993–2004).

Variety shows that became prominent during the 1970s, such as &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, &quot;The Flip Wilson Show&quot; and &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; (as well as &quot;The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot; succeeding afterwards) also continued to use Douglass&#x27;s sweetening for any less appealing jokes performed during sketches.

Game shows were sweetened during the 1970s and early 1980s, often played when a contestant or the host says something considered to be funny and only a small reaction comes from the live audience. Douglass&#x27;s laugh track was especially heard in Chuck Barris&#x27;s game shows (i.e. &quot;The Gong Show&quot; and &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;), whose shows were designed mainly to entertain the audience; the &quot;prizes&quot; were often rudimentary or derisive. Game shows that were produced at CBS Television City and NBC Studios Burbank were also sweetened, often to intensify audience reactions, including shows like &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; (used during &quot;Whammy&quot; segments). During a typical game show&#x27;s closing credits, the show used canned cheers and applause noises to sweeten the live studio audience applause noises that viewers did not hear during the credits. This was common on daytime game shows on CBS and NBC and some syndicated game shows from the 1970s through the 1990s. Game shows taped at NBC Studios Burbank used three different applause tracks for sweetening: one with a smaller crowd, one with a medium crowd, and one with a large crowd with a cheerful male audience member in the background. However, many kids&#x27; game shows, most ABC game shows, and most Mark Goodson-Bill Todman productions, such as &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, &quot;Match Game&quot; and &quot;Family Feud&quot; were taped with a live audience present, though sweetening was used on rare occasions.

There were still some producers who either still did not trust a live audience, produced a show that was too complex for an audience to be present, favored the single-camera method, or could not afford to screen it live to an audience for responses. In these cases, Douglass orchestrated the laugh track from scratch. Sitcoms like &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; and &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; utilized the single-camera method for their entire run. Several hour-long comedy dramas, like &quot;The Love Boat&quot; and &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot;, used only a laugh track.

In the intervening years beginning with live film, progressing through videotape and onto studio-filmed productions with no live audience back to live-on-tape, Douglass had gone from merely enhancing or tweaking a soundtrack, to literally customizing entire audience reactions to each performance and back again to enhancing and tweaking performances recorded with live audiences.

===Competition and decline===
During the zenith of the 1970s era in U.S. television, Charles Douglass&#x27;s ascendancy in the domain of laugh track provision faced a notable challenge by 1977, as emerging competitors began offering alternatives to Douglass&#x27;s signature laugh sequences. Foremost among these challengers was Carroll Pratt, a protégé of Douglass and accomplished sound engineer in his own right, who embarked on establishing his venture, Sound One.

Having apprenticed under Douglass since the early 1960s, Pratt and his brother discerned that Douglass&#x27;s methodologies lagged behind technological advancements, with discernible degradation in the quality of Douglass&#x27;s laugh tracks. Pratt noted an audible deterioration in sound quality attributable to the wear and tear on Douglass&#x27;s tape library, compounded by evolving audience sensibilities towards sitcom humor, which necessitated a more nuanced and subdued approach to laughter augmentation.

Cognizant of these shifting dynamics, Pratt opted to diverge from Douglass&#x27;s paradigm, devising a more user-friendly and technically advanced &quot;laff box&quot; utilizing cassette tape technology, in contrast to Douglass&#x27;s somewhat antiquated reel-to-reel apparatus. Moreover, Pratt&#x27;s pioneering adoption of stereo recordings, synchronized with the emergence of stereophonic television broadcasts, afforded a perceptible improvement in audio fidelity, particularly in comparison to Douglass&#x27;s efforts to retrofit mono recordings into a stereo format.

Pratt&#x27;s laugh track innovations introduced a departure from Douglass&#x27;s distinctive laughter sequences, offering a more diverse and naturalistic sonic palette. While retaining elements of recognizable laughter, Pratt&#x27;s compositions exhibited a greater subtlety and restraint, eschewing the overt familiarity associated with Douglass&#x27;s ubiquitous laugh tracks. This shift resonated with certain sitcom productions, such as &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, which gravitated towards Pratt&#x27;s offerings, particularly given their tonal compatibility with more dramatic narratives.

By the decade&#x27;s denouement, Pratt&#x27;s ascendancy supplanted Douglass&#x27;s hegemony, evidenced by the widespread adoption of Pratt&#x27;s laugh tracks across a spectrum of live and single-camera sitcoms (&quot;Laverne and Shirley&quot;, &quot;Happy Days&quot;, &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot;, including productions by MTM Enterprises (&quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; (CBS, 1978–82), &quot;Newhart&quot; (CBS, 1982–90)). Douglass, compelled to adapt to the evolving landscape, embarked on a revitalization effort, refining his laugh track library to incorporate fresher compositions while preserving vestiges of his trademark guffaws. However, the reception to Douglass&#x27;s revamped offerings was mixed, underscoring Pratt&#x27;s hegemony in an increasingly competitive market.

This epochal shift in laugh track provision coincided with broader transformations within the television landscape, notably marked by the advent of single-camera comedies, championed by entities like HBO, which eschewed the traditional laugh track in favor of a more naturalistic audiovisual aesthetic. Single-camera comedies such as &quot;Dream On&quot; and &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; were permitted to run without laugh tracks, and won critical praise for doing so. Concurrently, animated shows followed suit, abandoning laugh tracks altogether, save for occasional parodic usage. Animated shows that used to employ a laugh track, such as &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, had dismissed the laugh track altogether by the 1990s. However, sitcoms made by It&#x27;s a Laugh Productions, such as &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot;, use laugh tracks.

The practice of sweetening live awards shows persisted, albeit undergoing technological refinements to ensure seamless integration with live broadcasts.

In the contemporary milieu, the resurgence of multicamera sitcoms like &quot;Holliston&quot; on platforms such as Fearnet has witnessed a revival of laugh track utilization, underscoring the enduring appeal and nostalgic resonance of this venerable television tradition. However, the prevailing trend towards single-camera productions, coupled with evolving audience preferences, portends continued diversification in audiovisual storytelling modalities within the television lands.

===Controversy, bucking the trend===
The practice of simulating an audience reaction was controversial from the beginning. A silent minority of producers despised the idea of a prerecorded audience reaction. Douglass was aware that his &quot;laff box&quot; was maligned by critics and actors, but also knew that the use of a laugh track became standard practice. Leading industry experts reasoned that laugh tracks were a necessary evil in prime time television: without the canned laughter, a show was doomed to fail. It was believed that in the absence of any sort of audience reaction, American viewers could not differentiate between a comedy or drama. That did not stop several from forgoing the laugh track entirely:
* Former child star Jackie Cooper believed that the laugh track was false. Cooper&#x27;s comedy/drama &quot;Hennesey&quot; (CBS, 1959–62) was cancelled in 1962 after three seasons. For its first two seasons, the show used only a mild laugh track; by the third and final season, the chuckles were eliminated completely. Cooper later commented that &quot;we&#x27;re manufacturing a reaction to our own creation, yet we&#x27;ll never know if people out there are really laughing.&quot; Cooper concluded by saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a put-on all the time.&quot;
* In September 1964, the comedy/drama &quot;Kentucky Jones&quot; (NBC, 1964–65), starring Dennis Weaver, tried to eliminate laughs, simulated or live. After only five episodes and slumping ratings, Douglass was recruited to add the laugh track. &quot;Kentucky Jones&quot; was cancelled the following April.
* Ross Bagdasarian Sr., creator of the &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot; franchise, outright refused to utilize a laugh track when production began on &quot;The Alvin Show&quot; (CBS, 1961–62) in 1961. Bagdasarian&#x27;s reasoning was if the show was funny, the viewers would laugh without being prompted. &quot;The Alvin Show&quot; was cancelled after a single season.
* &quot;Peanuts&quot; creator Charles M. Schulz refused to employ a laugh track during the production of the holiday favorite &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; (CBS, 1965). Like Bagdasarian, Schulz maintained that the audience should be able to enjoy the show at their own pace, without being cued when to laugh. When CBS executives saw the final product, they were horrified and believed the special would be a flop (CBS did create a version of the show with the laugh track added, just in case Schulz changed his mind; this version remains unavailable). When the special first aired on December 9, 1965, it was a surprise critical and commercial hit. As a result of this success, all subsequent &quot;Peanuts&quot; specials aired with no laugh track present.
* &quot;Rocky and His Friends&quot; (ABC, 1959–61; NBC, 1961–64 as &quot;The Bullwinkle Show&quot;) was originally broadcast with a laugh track, against the wishes of creators Jay Ward and Bill Scott, who disputed the laugh track with ABC; given the rapid-fire pace of the show&#x27;s humor, the laugh track slowed the timing and at times interrupted dialogue. After getting support from sponsor General Mills, Ward and Scott convinced ABC, and the laugh track ended after its fourth episode; while current syndicated prints of these episodes still retain the laugh track, it has been subsequently removed from the DVD release.
* The musical sitcom &quot;The Monkees&quot; (NBC, 1966–68) featured a laugh track throughout its first season and several episodes of the second. Midway through Season 2, the Monkees band members insisted the show eliminate the laugh track, believing their viewers were intelligent enough to know where the jokes were. NBC, already annoyed by the rock group wanting too much control over their show, cancelled &quot;The Monkees&quot; after the conclusion of its second season, citing the removal of the laugh track as a significant factor. Peter Tork commented in 2013 that &quot;we didn&#x27;t want it from the beginning, but NBC insisted. I thought it was a stroke of genius when it was eliminated in the second season.&quot;
* When discussing the making of the sitcom &quot;Get Smart&quot; (NBC, 1965–69, CBS, 1969–70) in 2003, television producer and screenwriter Leonard B. Stern initially opposed to employing a laugh track for the sitcom, given its somewhat violent nature, calling it &quot;offensive&quot;. Stern and Mel Brooks relented and the earlier seasons contained a more-or-less modulated track. The laugh track got steadily more invasive as the show increasingly got camper in the later seasons. Comedian Don Adams, who played Maxwell Smart on &quot;Get Smart&quot;, reportedly hated the laugh track, citing it for refusing to watch the show in reruns. At a reunion seminar honoring the show in 2003, Adams stated, &quot;it offended me in the pilot, the laugh track. I would come in a room and say &#x27;Hello, 99!&#x27; and the guy would push the goddamn button! What the hell is funny about &#x27;Hello!&#x27;?&quot; In a 1995 Entertainment Weekly interview when discussing the legacy of the show, Adams firmly stated the laugh track was unnecessary. Conversely in the same interview, actress Barbara Feldon, who played Agent 99, was more lenient, saying &quot;You need a laugh track. Laughter inspires laughter.&quot;
* Bill Cosby&#x27;s first sitcom, &quot;The Bill Cosby Show&quot; (NBC, 1969–71) was produced without a laugh track at the insistence of Cosby. He stated that his opposition to NBC&#x27;s desire to add a laugh track led to the show&#x27;s cancellation after two seasons.
* Andy Griffith initially resisted the inclusion of a laugh track on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;. Co-star Don Knotts had previously been a member of the ensemble cast of &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; when it transitioned from a live audience to a laugh track in its fourth season. Knotts felt the artificial audience reaction contributed to the show&#x27;s demise – a sentiment that influenced Griffith&#x27;s opinion. Instead of a laugh track, Griffith insisted on screening completed episodes in front of an audience, recording their reaction, and inserting that into the show&#x27;s soundtrack (a practice that became more commonplace for television comedies in years to come). The earliest episodes include these custom audience reactions; however, Griffith&#x27;s experiment was too costly, and the network insisted on a Douglass laugh track. Griffith eventually compromised on the grounds that it be utilized sparingly.
* Larry Gelbart, co-creator of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (CBS, 1972–83), initially wanted the show to air without a laugh track (&quot;Just like the actual Korean War&quot;, he remarked dryly). Though CBS initially rejected the idea, a compromise was reached that allowed Gelbart and co-producer Gene Reynolds to omit the laugh track during operating room scenes if they wished. &quot;We told the network that under no circumstances would we ever can laughter during an OR scene when the doctors were working,&quot; said Gelbart in 1998. &quot;It&#x27;s hard to imagine that 300 people were in there laughing at somebody&#x27;s guts being sewn up.&quot; Seasons 1–5 utilized Douglass&#x27;s more invasive laugh track; Carroll Pratt&#x27;s quieter laugh track was employed for Seasons 6–11 when the series shifted from sitcom to comedy drama with the departure of Gelbart and Reynolds. Several episodes (&quot;O.R.&quot;, &quot;The Bus&quot;, &quot;&quot;Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler?&quot;, &quot;The Interview&quot;, &quot;Point of View&quot; and &quot;Dreams&quot; among them) omitted the laugh track; as did almost all of Season 11, including the 135-minute series finale, &quot;Goodbye, Farewell and Amen&quot;. The laugh track is also omitted from some international and syndicated airings of the show; on one occasion during an airing in the UK, the laugh track was accidentally left on, and viewers expressed their displeasure, an apology from the network for the &quot;technical difficulty&quot; was later released. The DVD releases, meanwhile, give the viewer a choice of watching every episode with or without the laugh tracks (though the French and Spanish track do not have this option). UK DVD critics speak poorly of the laugh track, stating &quot;canned laughter is intrusive at the best of times, but with a programme like &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, it&#x27;s downright unbearable.&quot; &quot;They&#x27;re a lie,&quot; said Gelbart in a 1992 interview. &quot;You&#x27;re telling an engineer when to push a button to produce a laugh from people who don&#x27;t exist. It&#x27;s just so dishonest. The biggest shows when we were on the air were &quot;All in the Family&quot; and &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; both of which were taped before a live studio audience where laughter made sense,&quot; continued Gelbart. &quot;But our show was a film show – supposedly shot in the middle of Korea. So the question I always asked the network was, &#x27;Who are these laughing people? Where did they come from? Gelbart persuaded CBS to test the show in private screenings with and without the laugh track. The results showed no measurable difference in the audience&#x27;s enjoyment. &quot;So you know what they said?&quot; Gelbart said. &quot;&#x27;Since there&#x27;s no difference, let&#x27;s leave it alone!&#x27; The people who defend laugh tracks have no sense of humor.&quot; Gelbart summed up the situation by saying, &quot;I always thought it cheapened the show. The network got their way. They were paying for dinner.&quot;
* The sitcom &quot;Police Squad!&quot;, which was a parody of police procedurals, did not utilize a laugh track in any of its six episodes. The decision not to incorporate one was at the behest of its creators, the trio of Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker, since most of the humor of the program was derived from events that occurred either in the foreground or in the background of various scenes.
* Another satirical police sitcom, &quot;Sledge Hammer!&quot; (ABC, 1986–88), utilized a laugh track for the first 13 episodes of its first season, of which creator Alan Spencer did not approve. After months of fighting with ABC, Spencer was able to cease adding laughter beginning with episode 14, &quot;State of Sledge&quot;.
* The sitcom &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; (ABC, 1991–94) initially featured a laugh track. At the insistence of co-producers Brian Henson and Michael Jacobs, it was eventually dropped as the show grew in popularity.
* &quot;Sports Night&quot; (ABC, 1998–2000) premiered with a laugh track, against the wishes of show creator Aaron Sorkin, but the laugh track became more subtle as the season progressed and was completely removed at the start of the second season. In some cases, a laugh track was needed to maintain continuity, as portions of each episode were filmed in front of a live audience, while the remainder were filmed without an audience present.
* The 2020 revival of &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; is a single-camera sitcom that dropped the live audience and laugh track altogether, which is a major difference from the original series.

==Outside the U.S.==
===United Kingdom===
In the second half of the 20th century, most sitcoms in the United Kingdom were taped before live audiences to provide natural laughter. Scenes recorded outdoors, traditionally recorded in advance of studio work, are played back to the studio audience and their laughter is recorded for the broadcast episode (occasionally, entire shows have been recorded in this fashion, for example, the later series of &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; and &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;). 

One notable exception to the use of a live audience was Thames Television&#x27;s &quot;The Kenny Everett Video Show&quot;, whose laugh track consisted of spontaneous reaction to sketches from the studio production crew. This technique was maintained throughout its four-year run, even as the show moved to larger studio facilities and its emphasis switched from music to comedy. Everett&#x27;s later series for the BBC (&quot;The Kenny Everett Television Show&quot;) were recorded in front of live studio audiences.

In the early 1980s it was BBC policy that comedy programmes be broadcast with a laugh track, though producers did not always agree this suited their programmes. As a result, a laugh track for &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; was recorded for the first episode, but dropped before transmission. &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot; was originally broadcast with a laugh track, but this was dropped after the programme&#x27;s second series.

The pilot episode of the satirical series &quot;Spitting Image&quot; was also broadcast with a laugh track, apparently at the insistence of Central Television. This idea was dropped as the show&#x27;s producers felt that the show worked better without one. Some later editions, in 1992 (Election Special) and 1993 (two episodes) did use a laughter track, as these were performed live in front of a studio audience and included a spoof &quot;Question Time&quot;.

Most episodes of &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; feature a studio audience; the exceptions, which featured no laughter at all, were all Christmas specials, &quot;To Hull and Back&quot;, &quot;A Royal Flush&quot; and the second part of &quot;Miami Twice&quot;. For their DVD releases, &quot;A Royal Flush&quot; (which was edited to remove over 20 minutes of footage) had an added laughter track, as did the second part of &quot;Miami Twice&quot; (which was merged with the first part to make &quot;Miami Twice: The Movie&quot;).

Beginning in the late 1990s, comedies such as &quot;The Royle Family&quot; and &quot;The Office&quot; pioneered a cinéma vérité style without audience laughter. This largely continued into 21st century sitcoms. Although &quot;Green Wing&quot; does not feature audience laughter, partly because of its surreal nature, it does feature unusual lazzi techniques, where the film of the episode is slowed down immediately following a joke. &quot;Mrs Brown&#x27;s Boys&quot; and &quot;Still Open All Hours&quot; are notable reversions to the older format with a studio audience.

===Canada===
In the landscape of contemporary Canadian television comedies, the prevalent trend eschews the incorporation of a laugh track. However, notable exceptions exist, exemplified by select programs such as the sitcom &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; (1990–1993) and the children&#x27;s program &quot;The Hilarious House of Frightenstein&quot; (1971), which, despite originating from Canada without a laugh track, saw the addition of such an element for U.S. broadcasts.

The evolution of laugh track utilization within Canadian television is further exemplified by the trajectory of the children&#x27;s sketch comedy series &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Television&quot; (1979–90). Initially absent during its inaugural season as a locally televised program, the introduction of a laugh track coincided with its transition to Canadian network broadcasting under the title &quot;Whatever Turns You On&quot;. This laugh track, predominantly composed of children&#x27;s laughter with intermittent inclusion of adult reactions, underscored the unique nature of the show. However, the consistency and effectiveness of the laugh track exhibited variation across seasons.

Noteworthy fluctuations in laugh track implementation and quality are discernible throughout the series&#x27; run. The 1981 episodes stand out for their diverse array of laughter samples, contributing to an authentic auditory experience. In contrast, the 1982 season, coinciding with the series&#x27; debut on the U.S. cable channel Nickelodeon, witnessed a reduction in the variety of laughs utilized. Furthermore, the introduction of Carroll Pratt&#x27;s titter track, reminiscent of laugh tracks employed in popular U.S. sitcoms such as &quot;Happy Days&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot;, introduced a distinct tonal shift.

Subsequent adjustments in laugh track composition aimed to mitigate issues of repetition and enhance auditory diversity. Notably, the latter half of the 1982 season saw a blend of different laughter samples, alongside the incorporation of the titter track. However, the quality of the laugh track experienced fluctuations, evident in the notably subdued and inadequately edited tracks of 1983.

Efforts to rectify these deficiencies culminated in improvements by 1984, with laughter tracks resembling those utilized in the 1982 season, albeit without the inclusion of the titter track. Notably, the introduction of a new children&#x27;s laugh track in 1986, characterized by distinctly younger laughter samples, aimed to resonate with the target demographic of the series.

Upon its revival in 1989, the series adopted a hybrid approach, utilizing laugh tracks from both the 1981 and 1986 iterations, underscoring the continued evolution and adaptation of laugh track aesthetics within the context of Canadian television production.

===China===
&quot;I Love My Family&quot;, the first multi-camera sitcom in mainland China, used a live studio audience. Some single-camera comedies, such as &quot;iPartment&quot;, used a laugh track.

Laugh tracks are commonly used in variety shows for comic effect. Examples include &quot;Super Sunday&quot;, &quot;Kangxi Lai Le&quot;, &quot;Variety Big Brother&quot; and &quot;Home Run&quot;.

===Latin America===
Several Latin American countries like Argentina replace the laugh track with a crew of off-screen people paid specifically to laugh on command whenever the comedic situation merits a laugh. Known as &quot;reidores&quot; (&quot;laughers&quot;), a senior laugher signals all the others when to laugh. In others like Mexico, comedies without audience reactions were openly stated to have no laugh track because they respected their audience, most notably Chespirito programs like &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot; and &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot;, with the announcer in the starting credits stating &quot;Por una cuestión de respeto al público este programa no contiene risas grabadas&quot; (&quot;As a form of respect towards the audience, this show does not features canned laughs.&quot;).

===France===
In the realm of French television comedy, the prevalent convention eschews the inclusion of laugh tracks. However, a notable departure from this trend occurred within the productions of AB Productions, helmed by Jean-Luc Azoulay, notably exemplified by series such as &quot;Hélène et les Garçons&quot; and its subsequent spin-offs. These interconnected series, characterized by their adherence to sitcom conventions, including a duration of approximately twenty minutes and a predominantly single-camera setup, eschewed the presence of a studio audience. The absence of live audience participation stemmed from the exigencies of production, characterized by stringent editing schedules and truncated principal photography sessions, rendering the integration of genuine audience laughter unfeasible.

Critiques levied against these productions centered on various aspects, ranging from deficiencies in direction and performances to the employment of non-professional actors. Moreover, the attempt to emulate American television series formats, combining elements of sitcoms, soap operas, and teen dramas, elicited considerable criticism, with particular attention directed towards the perceived overreliance on canned laughter. This emulation was viewed as diluting the authenticity and cultural specificity of French television comedy, instead favoring a formulaic approach heavily influenced by transatlantic norms.

==Effects==
In order to gauge the continued relevance of Douglass&#x27;s laugh track, a study was published in 1974 in the &quot;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&quot; that concluded people were still more likely to laugh at jokes that were followed by canned laughter. &quot;That Girl&quot; co-creator Sam Denoff commented in 1978 that &quot;laughter is social. It&#x27;s easier to laugh when you&#x27;re with people.&quot; Denoff added &quot;in a movie theatre, you don&#x27;t need a laugh track, but at home, watching TV, you&#x27;re probably alone or with just a few others.&quot;

Dartmouth College psychology professor Bill Kelley gauged the necessity of the laugh track, particularly on U.S. sitcoms. He stated &quot;we&#x27;re much more likely to laugh at something funny in the presence of other people.&quot; Kelley&#x27;s research compared students&#x27; reactions to an episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, which utilizes a laugh track, to those watching &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, which does not. Brain scans suggested that viewers found the same things funny and the same regions of their brain lit up whether or not they heard others laughing. Despite this, Kelley still found value in the laugh track. &quot;When done well,&quot; Kelley commented, &quot;they can give people pointers about what&#x27;s funny and help them along. But when done poorly, you notice a laugh track and it seems unnatural and out of place.&quot;

A 2017 study by Andreas M. Baranowski and colleagues at University of Mainz further explored the effects of laugh tracks, expanding the research to include other audience reactions such as canned screaming. The researchers conducted three experiments with a total of 110 participants, comparing the influence of laugh tracks, scream tracks, and no audience sound on the perception of comedy, horror, and neutral film scenes. Their findings reinforced prior studies, showing that laugh tracks increased amusement, particularly for material that was only mildly funny. However, unlike laugh tracks, canned scream tracks did not significantly heighten fear responses. When real confederates provided audience reactions, the effects were even stronger, demonstrating that social cues—whether live or recorded—play a significant role in shaping emotional reactions to media. The study also found that congruent audience reactions enhanced viewer immersion, with comedies being most engaging when accompanied by laughter and horror films most immersive when paired with screams. These results suggest that audience reactions, even artificial ones, can alter a viewer’s perception and emotional engagement with media content.

==Legacy and support==
Since its inception, the idea of prerecorded laughter has had its share of supporters as well as detractors.

Si Rose, executive producer for Sid and Marty Krofft, convinced the Kroffts to use a laugh track on their puppet shows, such as &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot;, &quot;The Bugaloos&quot; and &quot;Sigmund and the Sea Monsters&quot;. Rose stated:
 In 2000, Sid Krofft commented, &quot;We were sort of against that [the laugh track], but Si Rose – being in sitcoms – he felt that when the show was put together that the children would not know when to laugh.&quot; Marty Krofft added:
 When discussing the show&#x27;s production techniques for &quot;The Bugaloos&quot; DVD commentary track in 2006, British series stars Caroline Ellis and John Philpott addressed the laugh track, which at that time was uncharacteristic and often scorned in the United Kingdom. &quot;I was never one for the American canned laughter, because sometimes it&#x27;s too much,&quot; said Ellis. She added, however, that it does help in creating &quot;the atmosphere for the reaction.&quot; Philpott added that, unlike their UK counterparts, US viewing audiences at the time had become accustomed to hearing laughter, saying, &quot;I think you find yourself genuinely laughing more if you are prompted to laugh along with the canned laughter.&quot; When viewing the Kroffts&#x27; &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot; for the first time, &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; star Susan Olsen described the laugh track as &quot;overbearing,&quot; saying, &quot;I remember being eight years old...and just thinking, &#x27;Will they get rid of that awful canned laughter?! Olsen added that recreational drug use was necessary to enjoy the silliness of the program, saying, &quot;I never tried combining mind-altering substances and Krofft entertainment; I&#x27;m afraid the laugh track would send me on a bad trip.&quot;

In a 2007 interview, Filmation producer/founder Lou Scheimer praised the laugh track for its usage on &quot;The Archie Show&quot;. &quot;Why did we use a laugh track?&quot; Scheimer asked. &quot;Because it makes the audience want to laugh with all the other people who are watching [at home]. And you felt like [you were] part of the show than just [being] an observer.&quot; Scheimer confirmed that &quot;The Archie Show&quot; was the first Saturday morning cartoon to utilize a laugh track.

Television and laugh track historian Ben Glenn, II, commented that the laugh tracks currently used are radically different from the &quot;carefree&quot; quality of the laughter of past:
Several months after Douglass&#x27;s death in 2003, his son Bob commented on the pros and cons of his father&#x27;s invention:
Carroll Pratt confirmed Douglass&#x27;s comments in a June 2002 interview with the Archive of American Television, saying that producers regularly wanted louder, longer laughs:
Few re-recording mixers have carried on the &quot;laff box&quot; tradition. In addition to Bob Douglass, Los Angeles-based mixers Bob La Masney, and Sound One&#x27;s Jack Donato and John Bickelhaupt currently specialize in audience sweetening. While modern digital machines are not as cumbersome as Douglass&#x27;s original machinery, Bickelhaupt confirmed they &quot;are pretty anonymous, with [unlabeled] knobs and buttons. We like to remain kind of mysterious – the man-behind-the-curtain thing. We don&#x27;t really like to talk about it too much.&quot; Bickelhaupt added that &quot;most of the time, what we&#x27;re doing isn&#x27;t re-creating a studio audience; the audience laughter is already there. But in editing, when sections of the show are taken out, when they take out lines to make the show fit a time slot – we have to cover the bridge between one laugh and another by using the laugh machine.&quot; In reference to the quiet laugh track employed on &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, Bickelhaupt commented that producers are increasingly &quot;shying away from that big, full audience – the raucous sound that was more commonplace in the 70s, 80s, and 90s. They want a more subtle track.&quot; Bickelhaupt concluded, &quot;I have a great job. When you sit and work on comedy all day, you can&#x27;t possibly get depressed. When people ask me what I do for a living, I tell them, &#x27;I laugh.

Steven Levitan, creator of &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot; (a multi-camera series that used live and taped audience reactions) and co-creator of &quot;Modern Family&quot; (which does not utilize live or recorded audience laughter as a single-camera series), commented, &quot;When used properly, the laugh guy&#x27;s job is to smooth out the soundtrack – nothing more.&quot; Phil Rosenthal confirmed that he &quot;rarely manipulated the laughs&quot; on &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;. &quot;I worked on shows in the past where the &#x27;sweetener&#x27; was ladled on with a heavy hand, mainly because there were hardly any laughs from the living. The executive producers would say, &#x27;Don&#x27;t worry – you know who will love that joke? Mr. Sweet man. Bickelhaupt confirmed this observation, admitting there are many occasions he has created all audience responses. Conversely, Lloyd J. Schwartz, son of &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; creator Sherwood Schwartz, admitted in his book, &quot;Brady, Brady, Brady&quot;, that the laugh track in his directorial debut of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; (S4E23 &quot;Room at the Top&quot;) was &quot;significantly louder than any of the other [&quot;Brady Bunch&quot;] episodes.&quot; Schwartz added, &quot;I&#x27;m a little embarrassed about it now, but I wanted to make sure that the manufactured audience got all the jokes I directed.&quot;

Karal Ann Marling, professor of American studies and art history at the University of Minnesota, voiced concerns about Douglass&#x27;s invention:
Marling added she was concerned more about canned laughter as a symptom of a larger social willingness to accept things uncritically, which included political messages as well as commercial messages. &quot;It&#x27;s a kind of decline in American feistiness and an ability to think for yourself,&quot; she said. &quot;It certainly is embedded, but that doesn&#x27;t make it a good thing. There are a lot of things that we do every day of the week that aren&#x27;t good things. And this is one of them.&quot;

<doc id="263911" wikidata="Q5270730" url="?curid=263911" title="Diamond Bessie">
<text>Diamond Bessie (1854 - January 21, 1877) was the popular name given to Bessie Moore, née Annie Stone (although other sources give her birth name as Annie Moore), a prostitute whose murder in the woods outside Jefferson, Texas, propelled her to the level of local legend. She was killed by a single gunshot wound to the head, allegedly by her husband, Abraham Rothschild.

==Early life==
Bessie was born in 1854 in Syracuse, New York, to a shoe dealer. At 15, she left home and took up with a man named Moore. She was described as an extraordinary beauty with black hair and brilliant grey eyes.

After this affair ended, she entered into prostitution (though she kept Moore&#x27;s name). By all accounts, she adapted to the life quickly, and her numerous male admirers showered her with gifts of diamond jewelry. Moore plied her trade in brothels, firstly in the Mansion of Joy brothel in Cincinnati, Ohio. She later worked at brothels in New Orleans, Louisiana and finally Hot Springs, Arkansas.

==Association with Abraham Rothschild==
Abraham (or Abe) Rothschild (born 1853 in Cincinnati, Ohio) was the son of Meyer Rothschild, a Cincinnati jeweler. He was not a member of the prominent European Rothschild banking family. 
He was handsome and a capable businessman, and for a time he worked as a traveling salesman for his father&#x27;s prosperous jewelry business. His future looked bright, but his attraction to fast living and women soon led to alcoholism, and he became an embarrassment to his family, frequenting saloons and brothels. He met Bessie Moore in a Hot Springs brothel in 1876. From this time until her death, they were together. 

Moore pressured Rothschild to marry her, and according to various accounts, she may have claimed she was pregnant (an autopsy later showed that she was not) and threatened to reveal this scandalous fact to Rothschild&#x27;s father. Whatever the motive, Moore and Rothschild&#x27;s relationship was known to be tumultuous, marred by alcoholism and physical abuse. Rothschild is said to have forced Moore to prostitute herself numerous times during their travels together. 

On their way from Chicago to Texas in January 1877, they stopped in Danville, Illinois where they married at the Aetna Hotel. A reporter with the Danville News talked to the couple and published an article about them on January 11, 1877. Later, the Cincinnati Enquirer learned of the nuptials and published the news item from Danville on March 3, 1877: &quot;The following from the Danville News may be accepted as conclusive evidence of the marriage of Abe Rothschild to Bessie Moore. She was as pretty as a picture. Her auburn hair, French twist, contrasted handsomely with her large blue eyes. Her lovely complexion and graceful form would have tired the heart of an Italian sculptor... They arrived as by appointment in the city yesterday afternoon and drove to the Aetna House, where matters were arranged and the date, day, and hour settled... Justice McMahan officiating, the nuptials were tied at the Aetna House. A reporter offered the congratulations of the News to the happy pair last night, and found them in room 52 making preparations for a journey into the Land of Morpheus, but they intended to change cars at 1:10 this morning and go South via E.T.H. &amp; C. Bon voyage Mr. and Mrs. A. Rothschild.&quot;

On January 17, 1877, the couple registered as husband and wife at the Capitol Hotel in Marshall, Texas, about 18 miles south of Jefferson. After two days, they traveled to Jefferson by train. Jefferson was, at this time, one of the largest and busiest river ports west of the Mississippi River. The exact nature of Rothschild&#x27;s business in Jefferson is not known, nor at what point his plan to murder Moore might have been hatched.

The couple registered at the Brooks House in Jefferson as &quot;A. Munroe and wife&quot;. Their fine clothes and, of course, Moore&#x27;s diamonds, made an immediate impression on the townsfolk. Rothschild is said to have first addressed his wife as &quot;Bessie&quot; during this trip, and the locals adapted this into &quot;Diamond Bessie&quot;.

==Death==
On the morning of January 21, Rothschild bought a picnic lunch from Henrique&#x27;s Restaurant, and the couple crossed the bridge at Cypress Bayou, walking away from town along the Marshall road. The last person to see them together was Frank Malloy, who noticed them in the restaurant before 11:00 am; Malloy took special note of Moore&#x27;s massive diamond rings. About three hours later, Rothschild was seen crossing the bridge back into Jefferson alone.

When questioned about his wife&#x27;s whereabouts at the Brooks House, Rothschild claimed she had stayed across the Bayou to visit friends. The following morning, he took breakfast alone at the hotel, where he was seen wearing Moore&#x27;s rings. On the morning of Tuesday, January 23, he boarded a train to Cincinnati with his and Moore&#x27;s luggage.

Bessie Moore&#x27;s body was discovered in the woods along the Marshall road on the afternoon of February 5 by Sarah King, an African American woman out collecting firewood. She had been shot in the head. The remnants of a picnic lunch were still scattered about. Her body was fully clothed, and had no jewelry. The townsfolk held a collection and raised $150 to pay for Moore&#x27;s burial.

==Arrest and trials==
In Cincinnati, Rothschild began drinking more heavily and was reportedly becoming quite paranoid, believing himself to be followed everywhere. He tried to shoot himself outside a saloon in late February, but only succeeded in putting out his right eye. After a few days in the hospital, he was arrested and jailed, awaiting extradition to Texas for the murder of &quot;Diamond Bessie Moore&quot;. 

With Rothschild&#x27;s real identity known, the case quickly became a &quot;cause celebre&quot;. The public fascination with the murder of a beautiful young woman at the hands of a wealthy scion of society held a lurid appeal comparable to the contemporary murder trials of O. J. Simpson or the Menéndez brothers. It was Texas&#x27; first big murder case, called by Texas governor Richard B. Hubbard, &quot;a crime unparalleled in the record of blood.&quot;

Though Rothschild was the black sheep of his family, their fear of devastating scandal evidently prompted them to rally to his side and hire him a formidable defense team. Rothschild had no fewer than 10 high-priced attorneys. They immediately secured a change of venue, as feelings toward Rothschild in Jefferson were so hostile, any possible jury pool was hopelessly tainted. The townspeople were known to have contributed money to reimburse Sheriff John Vines for his trip to Cincinnati to arrest Rothschild.

The case finally went to trial in December 1878 in Marshall. While in jail in Marshall, Rothschild&#x27;s cellmate was Jim Currie, a railroad employee who had shot two actors, killing one; the survivor was actor Maurice Barrymore.

After a 3 week long trial Rothschild was convicted — the jury foreman reportedly drew a noose on the wall during deliberations with the slogan, &quot;That&#x27;s my verdict!&quot; — but the conviction was overturned on appeal. There was widespread opinion that Rothschild&#x27;s wealth and Moore being a prostitute influenced the appellate court. 

After much legal wrangling, Rothschild went to trial again on December 22, 1880, this time in Jefferson. Rothschild did not testify in his own defense, and his lawyers managed to plant doubts in the jury members. Rothschild, to the dismay of many, was acquitted, and rejoined his family in Cincinnati. 

After the acquittal, Rothschild returned to Cincinnati and continued a life of crime. Rothschild&#x27;s later exploits include posing as a wealthy businessman in several southern towns to acquire large quantities of jewelry on credit, and then quickly leaving town before being discovered.

Diamond Bessie Moore became a figure of folklore. Every May since 1955, Jefferson during its annual Pilgrimage Festival, produces a play titled &quot;The Diamond Bessie Murder Trial&quot;, derived from court transcripts, is performed. Diamond Bessie&#x27;s grave in Jefferson&#x27;s Oakwood Cemetery is a popular tourist attraction; unmarked for years, it bears a tombstone, installed one 1930s night by a retired foundry worker, E B McDonald: &quot;I placed it there one night because it did not seem right for Diamond Bessie to sleep in an unmarked grave.&quot; Note the date on the tombstone he put is incorrect as she was last seen alive on January 21, 1877, and found dead on February 5, 1877. The Jessie Wise Allen Garden Club later erected an ornate iron fence around the plot.

<doc id="263914" wikidata="Q487473" url="?curid=263914" title="Toto Cutugno">
<text>Salvatore &quot;Toto&quot; Cutugno (; 7 July 1943 – 22 August 2023) was an Italian pop singer-songwriter, musician, and television presenter. He was best known for his worldwide hit song, &quot;, released on his 1983 album of the same title. Cutugno also won the Eurovision Song Contest 1990 held in Zagreb, SFR Yugoslavia, with the song &quot;, for which he wrote both the lyrics and music. He has been described as &quot;one of the most popular singers in Italy and a symbol of Italian melody abroad&quot;, as well as &quot;one of the most popular Italian performers on a global scale&quot; and &quot;one of the most successful Italian songwriters of all time&quot;, selling over 100 million records worldwide.

==Early life==
Toto Cutugno was born on 7 July 1943 in Tendola, a borough of Fosdinovo, Lunigiana, Tuscany, to a Sicilian sea marshal father from Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto and a housewife mother from Tuscany. Shortly after his birth the family moved to the nearby city of La Spezia, Liguria.

==Career==

Cutugno began his musical career as a drummer, and at 19 he founded his first band, . He later formed the disco band Albatros together with Lino Losito and Mario Limongelli. He also started a career as a songwriter, contributing some of French-American singer Joe Dassin most well-known songs such as &quot;, &quot;, and &quot;&quot; (written with Vito Pallavicini). He also co-wrote Dalida&#x27;s &quot;Monday Tuesday... Laissez moi danser&quot; (&quot;&quot; in its Italian version), which achieved Platinum record status shortly after being released, as well as songs for Johnny Hallyday, Mireille Mathieu, Ornella Vanoni, Domenico Modugno, Claude François, Gigliola Cinquetti, Gérard Lenorman, Michel Sardou, Hervé Vilard, and Paul Mauriat.

In 1976, Albatros participated for the first time in the Sanremo Music Festival finishing in third place with the song &quot;. Following another chart success with the song &quot;, in 1978 Cutugno left Albatros to concentrate on his solo career. The same year he had his first solo hit with &quot;&quot;, the opening song of the Mike Bongiorno&#x27;s RAI TV show . In 1979, he wrote Adriano Celentano&#x27;s number one hit &quot;&quot;.

In 1980, Cutugno returned to the Sanremo Music Festival and won the competition with the song &quot;&quot; (&quot;Only us&quot;). However, Cutugno&#x27;s affiliation with the festival is mostly remembered for &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Italian&quot;), a song he presented in 1983. Originally intended for Adriano Celentano – who declined to sing it because, despite liking the song, he did not feel comfortable singing the refrain (&quot;I am a true Italian&quot;) – &quot;&quot;&#x27;s recapitulation of some of Italy&#x27;s most popular social traits made the song very popular with Italian expats. Although the song finished only fifth in Sanremo, it went on to become Cutugno&#x27;s biggest international hit. Cutugno would finish second in six more editions of the Sanremo festival: in 1984 with the song &quot;&quot; (&quot;Serenade&quot;); in 1987 with &quot;&quot; (&quot;Children&quot;); in 1988 with &quot;&quot; (&quot;Emotions&quot;); in 1989 with the song &quot;&quot; (&quot;Mothers&quot;); in 1990 with the song &quot;&quot; (&quot;Loves&quot;, but entitled &quot;Good Love Gone Bad&quot; in Ray Charles&#x27;s version); and in 2005 with Annalisa Minetti with the song &quot;&quot; (&quot;No one else in the world like us&quot;); a record which would lead him to be nicknamed &quot;the eternal second&quot; (). Cutugno shares the record for the highest number of participations in the festival – 15, namely in 1976, 1977, 1980, 1983, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1995, 1997, 2005, 2008, and 2010; one of only five artists (), the others being Al Bano, Anna Oxa, Milva and Peppino di Capri. In 2013, Cutugno was awarded a lifetime career award at the Sanremo Festival.

As a songwriter, during the 1980s Cutugno composed hit songs for numerous artists, notably Miguel Bosé (the Festivalbar winning song &quot;Super Superman&quot;), Adriano Celentano (&quot;), Luis Miguel (&quot;), Fausto Leali (&quot;), Peppino di Capri (&quot;), Ricchi e Poveri (&quot;), Fiordaliso (&quot; and &quot;&quot;). Starting from 1987, when he co-hosted with Lino Banfi the Sunday television show , Cutugno also had a successful career as a television presenter.

In 1990, at the refusal of Sanremo winners Pooh, Cutugno, who had placed second, was invited to represent Italy at the Eurovision Song Contest in Zagreb. He went on to win the contest with his own original composition &quot;&quot; (&quot;Together: 1992&quot;), a ballad which celebrated European political integration and the establishment of the European Union. Aged 46 years, 302 days, Cutugno became the oldest winner of the contest to date, surpassing the record set by André Claveau in 1958. Cutugno&#x27;s record stood until 2000, when the Olsen Brothers won the contest. Along with Gigliola Cinquetti, Italy&#x27;s earlier Eurovision winner, he presented the 1991 contest, which was staged in Rome as a result of his victory. Italy would only win again with Måneskin in 2021.
In 2014, he was the main subject of a Facebook page, (lit. &quot;The same photo of Toto Cutugno every day&quot;), which in a short time became an internet phenomenon, attracting thousands of likes, sharings and comments; the case eventually became the subject of a study of the Institute for Advanced Study in Pavia. In 2016, he returned to collaborate with Adriano Celentano, co-writing the song &quot;&quot; for the Mina–Celentano album .

Outside of Italy, Cutugno often toured in the United States, regularly performing in New York City and Atlantic City; he also toured Australia three times, represented by Italo-Australian impresario Duane Zigliotto. Countries where he was very popular include Germany, Spain, Romania, Turkey and Russia, where in 2013 he performed &quot;&quot; accompanied by the Red Army Choir. In March 2019, a group of politicians from the Ukrainian Parliament tried to stop Cutugno from performing in Kyiv, demanding through an open letter to the head of the country&#x27;s security services, Vasyl Hrytsak, to ban the singer from entering Ukrainian territory, labelling him as &quot;a Russian war supporter in Ukraine&quot; – probably because of his success in Russia and his relationship with the Red Army Choir. Two days before, fellow Italian singer Al Bano had been blacklisted on the Ukrainian website Myrotvorets. Cutugno rejected the accusations, describing himself as apolitical and highlighting how he had refused to perform in Crimea following its 2014 Russian occupation. Despite the controversy, the concert was eventually held in Kyiv on 23 March. The same year, Cutugno had his last significant television role as one of the coaches in the musical show . In August of that same year, he made one of his last live performances, as a guest in Jovanotti&#x27;s Jova Beach Tour.

==Personal life and death==
When he was five, Cutugno witnessed the death of his seven-year-old sister Anna, who choked on a gnocchi. His other siblings included Roberto and Rosanna (the first child to receive heart surgery in Italy, in Turin).

Cutugno was married to Carla from 1971 until his death. In 1990, he had a son from an extramarital relationship.

In 2007, Cutugno was diagnosed with prostate cancer with metastases reaching his kidneys, undergoing surgery and having his right kidney removed. He regarded his colleague Al Bano as the one who helped him to discover the cancer in time and who assisted him in the situation.

Cutugno died from prostate cancer at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, on 22 August 2023, aged 80.

<text>Henry Bradley, FBA (3 December 1845 – 23 May 1923) was a British philologist and lexicographer who succeeded James Murray as senior editor of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (OED).

==Early life==
Bradley had humble beginnings as a farmer&#x27;s son in Nottinghamshire, but by adolescence, he was already steeped in several languages of Classical learning, and he is supposed to have learned Russian in only 14 days. Simon Winchester records that some of Bradley&#x27;s childhood notebooks, discovered by a friend, contained

...lists of words peculiar to the Pentateuch or Isaiah, Hebrew singletons, the form of the verb &quot;to be&quot; in Algerine, Arabic, bardic and cuneiform lettering, Arabisms and Chaldaisms in the New Testament, with vocabularies that imply he was reading Homer, Virgil, Sallust and the Hebrew Old Testament at the same time. In another group the notes pass from the life of Antar ben Toofail by &#x27;Admar&#x27; (apparently of the age of Haroun Arrashid) to the rules of Latin verse, Hakluyt and Hebrew accents, whereupon follow notes on Sir William Hamilton and Dugald Stewart and a translation of parts of Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Prometheus&quot;...
For a long time, he was employed as a correspondence clerk for a cutlery firm in Sheffield. The first public outlet for his erudition was as a columnist in the &quot;Academy&quot;, a weekly literary magazine run by J. S. Cotton in London.

==&quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;==
Bradley came to James Murray&#x27;s attention in February 1884 when he reviewed the first fascicle of the OED, A–Ant, in the &quot;Academy&quot;. Bradley&#x27;s review praised the clear format and simple design of the dictionary and its economy in using quotations, but it also challenged Murray&#x27;s etymology, and this caused quite a stir. At the time, Bradley was an unknown freelance writer with no official academic credentials, yet his essay, showing a close knowledge of several languages, contained criticism that none of Murray&#x27;s colleagues had been able to provide. &quot;Anemone&quot; could not correctly be rendered as &quot;daughter of the wind,&quot; for example, because the Greek suffix was not &quot;exclusively patronymic,&quot; and &quot;alpaca&quot; was not Arabic in origin, as Murray had written, but more likely Spanish.

Bradley&#x27;s triumph was that both his praise and his criticism were fair and well-tempered; he was admiring without being sycophantic and corrective without being hostile. Recognizing that he had found a worthy peer who could prove invaluable in creating the Dictionary, Murray hired Bradley, first as an assistant editor, then as joint senior editor.

He has been overshadowed by James Murray, and it must be conceded that Bradley was a slower, less durable worker, frequently ill. However, he remains a noteworthy linguistic scholar, largely self-taught.

==Other work and honours==
After starting work on the OED, Bradley began to get the recognition he deserved, receiving honorary degrees from Oxford and Heidelberg and becoming a fellow of Magdalen College and the British Academy. He also served as President of London&#x27;s Philological Society and helped found the Society for Pure English (SPE), along with Henry Watson Fowler and others.

Henry Bradley contributed to the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; and the 11th edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica.&quot; He is the author, for example, for the article on Caedmon, the first English Christian poet.

Bradley&#x27;s most interesting book is &quot;The Making of English&quot;, the culmination of a philological life. It assesses change in English and the reasons for its borrowings from other tongues down through history, all without resorting to the obscure sets of symbols so unhappily relied on by specialised linguistics. In his Author&#x27;s Preface, Bradley addresses the book &quot;to educated readers unversed in philology,&quot; and he succeeds in popularising his speciality and making it readable rather than resorting to jargon, which he considered an affront to plain English.

==Death and reputation==
It was for the SPE that Bradley wrote his last piece, an introduction to &quot;Tract No. XIV: On the Terms Briton, British, Britisher&quot;. He wrote the first three paragraphs, suffered a stroke, and died two days later. The piece was finished by Robert Bridges and published along with Fowler&#x27;s &quot;Preposition at End&quot; and a brief obituary.

Simon Winchester&#x27;s &quot;The Meaning of Everything&quot; is the history of the &quot;OED&quot; which treats Bradley in most depth.

<text>Sir William Alexander Craigie (13 August 1867 – 2 September 1957) was a philologist and a lexicographer.

A graduate of the University of St Andrews, he was the third editor of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; and co-editor (with C. T. Onions) of the 1933 supplement. From 1916 to 1925 he was also Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon in the University of Oxford. Among the students he tutored, was the one who would succeed him in the Anglo-Saxon chair, J. R. R. Tolkien. He married Jessie Kinmond Hutchen of Dundee (born 1864–65; died 1947) daughter of William.

In 1925, Craigie accepted a professorship in English literature from the University of Chicago, with plans to edit a new American English dictionary, based on the Oxford model. He also lectured on lexicography at Chicago, while working on the &quot;Dictionary of American English&quot; and the &quot;Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue&quot;, a project he pioneered. Many twentieth-century American lexicographers studied under Craigie as a part of his lectureship, including Clarence Barnhart, Jess Stein, Woodford A. Heflin, Robert Ramsey, Louise Pound, and Allen Walker Read. Cragie retired to Watlington, England in 1936. He was elected an International member of the American Philosophical Society in 1942.

Craigie was also fluent in Icelandic and an expert in the field of rímur (rhyming epic poems). He made many valuable contributions in that field. His interest was awakened by a winter of study in Copenhagen, then the centre of Norse philology. He compiled the complete Oxford edition of Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s fairy tales, with previously untranslated tales being supplied by his wife. He befriended many of the great Norse philologists of the time and came across séra Einar Guðmundsson&#x27;s seventeenth-century Skotlands rímur, dealing with the Gowrie Conspiracy. He continued research in that field until the end of his life.

<text>Henry Spira (19 June 1927 – 12 September 1998) was an American activist for socialism and animal rights, who is regarded by some as one of the most effective animal advocates of the 20th century.

Working with Animal Rights International, a group he founded in 1974, Spira is particularly remembered for his successful campaign in 1976 against animal testing at the American Museum of Natural History, where cats were being experimented on for sex research, and for his full-page advertisement in 1980 in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that featured a rabbit with sticking plaster over the eyes, and the caption, &quot;How many rabbits does Revlon blind for beauty&#x27;s sake?&quot;

==Life and work==

===Early life===
Spira was born in Antwerp, Belgium, to Maurice Spira and Margit Spitzer Spira. Maurice and his father had worked in the diamond trade; his mother&#x27;s father, in Hungary, had risen to become chief rabbi of Hamburg. The family was comfortable financially; Henry had a nanny and was educated at a French-speaking &quot;lycée&quot;. When he was 10, his father went to Panama, and the rest of the family moved to Germany to live with Margit&#x27;s family. Spira joined a Jewish youth group and began to learn Hebrew.

His father sent for them in 1938; he had opened a store selling cheap clothes and jewellery, mostly to sailors, and Germany was an increasingly unsafe place for Jews. Henry was sent to a Roman Catholic school run by nuns, where lessons were conducted in Spanish, until his father ran out of money and could no longer afford the fees. He spent the next year working in his father&#x27;s store.

===New York and Hashomer Hatzair===
When he was thirteen, in December 1940, the family set sail for New York via Havana on the &quot;SS Copiapo&quot;. His father worked in the diamond industry there, and they rented an apartment on West 104th Street. Henry was sent to public school. He continued to study Hebrew – paying for lessons himself with vacation jobs – had his Bar Mitzvah ceremony, and wore a kippah.

In 1943, while at Stuyvesant High School, he became involved with Hashomer Hatzair, a left-wing, non-religious, Zionist group that helped to prepare young Jews to live on kibbutzim in Palestine. There were summer camps, where they hiked, were taught how to farm, and learned about gender equality. Australian philosopher Peter Singer writes that the anti-materialism and independence of mind that Spira learned from his time with Hashomer Hatzair – where he went by his Hebrew name, Noah – stayed with him for the rest of his life. Spira decided to leave home when he was sixteen, taking lodgings and an afternoon job in a machine shop, and attending school in the mornings.

===Merchant navy and army life===
In 1944, Spira became a supporter of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP). He and fellow activist John Black recruited New York City high school students to the SWP. He became a merchant seaman in 1945, joining other Trotskyists who were active in the National Maritime Union (NMU). When communist and left-leaning union members and leaders were purged from the NMU during the McCarthy era, he was blacklisted as a security risk; in March 1952, he was told that his presence on an American merchant vessel was &quot;inimical to the security of the U.S. government.&quot; He later told Peter Singer, &quot;I just figured it was part of the game: Fight the system and they get even with you.&quot;

He was drafted into the U.S. Army, serving in Berlin from 1953 to 1954, where he was assigned to speak to several hundred troops each week about news and current affairs. After two years in the Army, he worked at the General Motors (GM) factory in Linden, New Jersey on the assembly line. While working at GM, Spira said that he observed the power that individuals could exercise when they acted independently of an organization.

===Activism===

====Journalism and human rights activism====
During the 1950s and 1960s, Spira wrote for the SWP&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Militant,&quot; and other leftist and alternative publications, often under the name Henry Gitano. He covered a United Auto Workers strike in New Castle, Indiana, during 1955, in which striking workers were injured and martial law was declared. He also wrote extensively about the civil rights movement in Montgomery, Alabama, and Tallahassee, Florida, in 1956, during the bus boycott; and about the larger fight against segregation and for voting rights through the 1960s. He was known for talking directly to people involved in struggles and relaying their stories, and for building bridges between the labor and civil rights movements.

Between 1958 and 1959, &quot;The Militant&quot; published a series of articles he wrote about the FBI abuses of power under the leadership of J. Edgar Hoover. Singer suggests that the broader impact of the series beyond the narrow readership of the socialist newspaper taught Spira a lesson: that &quot;careful research can often turn up internal contradictions in what a large organization says and does.&quot;

Spira traveled to Cuba in 1958 shortly after Fidel Castro and his followers ousted Fulgencio Batista, writing about the changes he was witnessing, which &quot;reflected the exhilarating early days of the revolution, before American hostility had pushed Castro into the arms of the Soviet Union and led him to repress opposition.&quot; Spira was the first American journalist to travel to Cuba and interview Castro after the revolution. His writing led the SWP and other leftists to form the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, which worked to inform Americans about Cuba and prevent a U.S. invasion. Two weeks before the Bay of Pigs Invasion, Spira warned of preparations involving CIA coordination with Cuban exiles.&quot;
Spira was also involved in the Committee for NMU Democracy in the early 1960s, during a time when dissidents faced beatings and threats of violence by supporters of union president Joseph Curran. Spira wrote exposés of the ways in which Curran was &quot;ripping off&quot; union members, inspiring dissidents and rank-and-file workers within the NMU and in other trade unions.&quot;

In 1958, he graduated as a mature student from Brooklyn College in New York, and in 1966 began teaching English literature in a Manhattan public high school.

==== Animal rights activism ====
Spira told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he first became interested in animal rights in 1973 while looking after Nina, a friend&#x27;s cat: &quot;I began to wonder about the appropriateness of cuddling one animal while sticking a knife and fork into another.&quot;

Around the same time, he read a column by Irwin Silber in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, a left-wing newspaper in New York (now closed) about an article on 5 April 1973 by the Australian philosopher Peter Singer in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. Singer&#x27;s article was a review of &quot;Animals, Men and Morals&quot; (1971) by three Oxford philosophers, John Harris and Roslind and Stanley Godlovitch. Singer declared the book a manifesto for &quot;animal liberation,&quot; thereby coining the phrase.

Spira got hold of Singer&#x27;s article and felt inspired: &quot;Singer described a universe of more than 4 billion animals being killed each year in the USA alone. Their suffering is intense, widespread, expanding, systematic and socially sanctioned. And the victims are unable to organize in defence of their own interests. I felt that animal liberation was the logical extension of what my life was all about – identifying with the powerless and the vulnerable, the victims, dominated and oppressed.&quot;

In 1974, he founded Animal Rights International (ARI) in an effort to put pressure on companies that used animals. He is credited with the idea of &quot;reintegrative shaming&quot;, which involves encouraging opponents to change by working with them – often privately – rather than by vilifying them in public. Sociologist Lyle Munro writes that Spira went to great lengths to avoid using publicity to shame companies, using it only as a last resort.

In 1976, he led the ARI&#x27;s campaign against vivisection on cats that the American Museum of Natural History had been conducting for 20 years, intended to research the impact of certain types of mutilation on the sex lives of cats. The museum halted the research in 1977, and Spira&#x27;s campaign was hailed as the first ever to succeed in stopping animal experiments.

Another well-known campaign targeted cosmetics giant Revlon&#x27;s use of the Draize test, which involves dripping substances into animals&#x27; eyes, usually rabbits, to determine whether they are toxic. On 15 April 1980, Spira and the ARI took out a full-page ad in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, with the header, &quot;How many rabbits does Revlon blind for beauty&#x27;s sake?&quot; Within a year, Revlon had donated $750,000 to a fund to investigate alternatives to animal testing, followed by substantial donations from Avon, Bristol Meyers, Estée Lauder, Max Factor, Chanel, and Mary Kay Cosmetics, donations that led to the creation of the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing.

Other campaigns targeted the face branding of cattle, the poultry industry, and fast food giant KFC, with an ad that combined a KFC bucket and a toilet. Spira took a photograph of a primate who had been imprisoned for months in a Bethesda Naval Hospital chair to the Black Star Wire Service, which sent the picture around the world. It was shown to Indira Gandhi, India&#x27;s PM, who cancelled monkey exports to the United States, because the photograph suggested the U.S. Navy was violating a treaty with India that forbade military research on animals.

Nevertheless, Spira was an advocate of gradual change, negotiating with McDonald&#x27;s, for example, for better conditions in the slaughterhouses of its suppliers. He proved especially adept at leveraging the power of the larger animal welfare organizations, such as the Humane Society of the United States, to advance his campaigns.

In 1982, he quit teaching to become a full-time animal rights activist.

=== Death ===
Spira died of esophageal cancer in 1998, at the age of 71.

<text>Captain Jack&#x27;s Stronghold was a holdout of the Modoc people that is located between Tulelake and Canby, California. The stronghold, which is now part of Lava Beds National Monument, is named for Native American chief Kintpuash who was also known as Captain Jack. During the Modoc War in 1873, Captain Jack along with 53 Modoc warriors, and numerous women and children in a band of 160, managed to hold out against the United States Army which outnumbered them by as much as 10 to 1 for several months.

The Modoc retreated to this area because it was part of their traditional territory where they had hunted and lived before the start of the California genocide, when agents of the United States government assisted by private citizens began the systematic killing of thousands of indigenous peoples of California in the mid-19th century. Many of the brutal acts carried out against native populations were encouraged, tolerated, and perpetuated by state authorities and militias.

==History==

After the Battle of Lost River in November 1872, Captain Jack&#x27;s band settled into the area around stronghold for several months. The Modoc used the lava beds as a defensive stronghold because of the rough terrain, rocks that could be used in fortification, and irregular pathways to evade pursuers.

On January 17, 1873, a combined U.S. Army command of 225 soldiers supported by 104 Oregon and California volunteers were defeated by 51 Modoc warriors at the First Battle of the Stronghold. A total of 35 Whites were killed and many wounded while the Modoc suffered no deaths or serious injuries. The Second Battle of the Stronghold took place on April 15–17. After getting additional reinforcements, the US force captured the stronghold&#x27;s spring as well as cutting off access to Tule Lake. The attack resulted in the death of one officer and six enlisted men while thirteen soldiers were wounded. Reportedly the only Modoc casualty was a boy who was killed when a cannonball he tried to open with an axe, exploded and several Modoc women who died from sickness. 

After being cut off from their only water sources, the Modoc escaped on April 17. They used a crevice that had been left unguarded while US troops were moved from one position to another in preparation for the final assault on the stronghold. Over the next few weeks, most of the band were caught. The last group, which was made up of Captain Jack, John Schonchin, Black Jim, and Boston Charley, were finally captured on June 1, 1873. After being convicted of murdering General Edward Canby and Reverend Eleazer Thomas at a peace parley in April 1873, Captain Jack and the three others were hanged on October 3, 1873, at Fort Klamath. Canby would be the only US general to be killed in the Indian Wars.

==Historic site==
On June 1, 1932, Captain Jack&#x27;s Stronghold was designated &quot;California Historical Landmark #9&quot;.

<doc id="263957" wikidata="Q7604359" url="?curid=263957" title="Stations around Shepherd's Bush">
<text>Shepherd&#x27;s Bush is an area of west London, England, which has been served by a number of London Underground and commuter rail stations over the past 150 years, many of which have had similar names. The names &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Bush&quot;, &quot;Wood Lane&quot; and &quot;White City&quot; have each been used by several separate stations around the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush district, following a number of station renamings and closures.

==Former stations==
The first Shepherd&#x27;s Bush station was opened in 1864 by the Metropolitan Railway and Great Western Railway (GWR) on the Hammersmith &amp; City Railway (now part of the Hammersmith &amp; City line), adjacent to Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Market. It was closed in 1914 and replaced by two new stations: one to the north, also called Shepherd&#x27;s Bush (now named Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Market), and one to the south named .

A station called opened on the West London Railway in 1869. This was on the GWR Middle Circle route that ran from Paddington through Shepherd&#x27;s Bush to . In about 1905 this route became a branch of the Metropolitan Railway, terminating at Kensington (Addison Road) (now Kensington Olympia). It was also served by London &amp; North Western Railway Outer Circle trains from to Mansion House, but by 1914 this became an Earl&#x27;s Court to Willesden Junction shuttle. Uxbridge Road station was located at the eastern end of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green, close to the start of Holland Park Avenue. It closed in 1940.

The London and South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR) opened its Shepherd&#x27;s Bush station in 1869 on a loop line that connected the West London Line to the Hammersmith &amp; City line and the L&amp;SWR&#x27;s tracks to (now the District line). The station was located on the west side of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Road (A219) at the junction with Sulgrave Road. It closed in 1916.

The Central London Railway (CLR) opened its subterranean Shepherd&#x27;s Bush station in 1900, with its entrance overlooking Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green, next to the MR&#x27;s Uxbridge Road station.

The Franco-British Exhibition and the 1908 Summer Olympics brought about the development of the exhibition and events area known as the White City, and two new Underground stations opened to serve these major international events, both named &quot;Wood Lane&quot;: the CLR Wood Lane station was a sub-surface station located on the eponymous lane, while the Wood Lane Metropolitan station was situated on a viaduct on its Hammersmith branch nearby. The CLR station closed in 1947 and lay derelict until 2008 when it was demolished to make way for the White City bus station. The Metropolitan station was renamed White City in 1947 and finally closed in 1959.
==Current stations==
In 2008 the arrangement of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush stations changed when two new stations were opened, on the West London Line (close to the location of the former Uxbridge Road Metropolitan line station) and station on the Hammersmith &amp; City line (situated near the former Wood Lane/White City Metropolitan line station). Today, two stations bear the name &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Bush&quot;: station, on the Central line, and the West London Line Shepherd&#x27;s Bush station. The two present-day Shepherd&#x27;s Bush stations are in close proximity and form an interchange between London Underground and National Rail.

With the addition of another station bearing the name &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Bush&quot;, it was decided to rename the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush station on the Hammersmith &amp; City line (the old 1914 Metropolitan line Shepherd&#x27;s Bush station) to Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Market to avoid confusion with the Overground and Central line stations.

None of the 1908 White City exhibition stations now survive and all the stations in the Wood Lane area are newer constructions: the present Central line White City Underground station (opened in 1947 to replace the former Wood Lane station) and the 2008 Wood Lane Hammersmith &amp; City line station.

<doc id="263960" wikidata="Q2031121" url="?curid=263960" title="Warship">
<text>A warship or combatant ship is a ship that is used for naval warfare. Usually they belong to the navy branch of the armed forces of a nation, though they have also been operated by individuals, cooperatives and corporations. As well as being armed, warships are designed to withstand damage and are typically faster and more maneuverable than merchant ships. Unlike a merchant ship, which carries cargo, a warship typically carries only weapons, ammunition and supplies for its crew.

In wartime, the distinction between warships and merchant ships is often blurred. Until the 17th century it was common for merchant ships to be pressed into naval service, and not unusual for more than half of a fleet to be composed of merchant ships—there was not a large difference in construction, unlike the difference between a heavily armoured battleship and an ocean liner. Until the threat of piracy subsided in the 19th century, it was normal practice to arm larger merchant ships such as galleons. Warships have also often been used as troop carriers or supply ships, such as by the French Navy in the 18th century or the Imperial Japanese Navy during the Second World War. In war since the early 20th century, merchant ships were often armed and used as auxiliary warships, such as the Q-ships of the First World War and the armed merchant cruisers of the Second World War.

==Types and classes==
The main types of warships today are, in order of decreasing size: aircraft carriers – amphibious assault ships – cruisers – destroyers – frigates – corvettes – fast attack boats. A more extensive list follows:

* Submarine, are ships capable of staying submerged for days. Modern submarines can stay underwater for months, with food supplies as the only limiting factor.
**Fleet submarine is a type of submarine with the speed, range, and endurance to operate as part of a navy&#x27;s battle fleet.
**Ballistic Missile Submarine is a submarine capable of deploying submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) with nuclear warheads. 
**Cruise missile submarine are submarines equipped with cruise missiles.
**Attack Submarine is a submarine with the purpose of attacking other submarines.
**Coastal submarine or littoral submarine is a small, maneuverable type of submarine with shallow draft well suited to navigation of coastal channels and harbors.
**Midget submarine is any submarine under 150 tons, typically operated by a crew of one or two but sometimes up to six or nine.
**Submarine aircraft carrier is a submarine equipped with aircraft for observation or attack missions. These submarines saw their most extensive use during World War II, although their operational significance remained small.
**Cruiser submarine were a type of a very large submarine designed to remain at sea for extended periods in areas distant from base facilities.
* Amphibious warfare ships are warships employed to land and support ground forces, such as marines, on enemy territory during an amphibious assault.
**Amphibious assault ship is a type of amphibious warfare ship employed to land and support ground forces with ship-deployed helicopters and V/STOL aircraft on enemy territory by an amphibious assault.
***Landing helicopter dock is a multipurpose amphibious assault ship that is capable of operating as a helicopter carrier and also has a well deck for supporting landing crafts.
**Amphibious transport dock is an amphibious warfare ship, that embarks, transports, and lands elements of a landing force for expeditionary warfare missions.
**Dock landing ship is an amphibious warfare ship with a well dock to transport and launch landing craft and amphibious vehicles.
**Landing craft are small and medium seagoing watercraft, such as boats and barges, used to convey a landing force (infantry and vehicles) from the sea to the shore during an amphibious assault. 
***Landing Craft Utility is a type of landing craft used by amphibious forces to transport equipment and troops to the shore. They are capable of transporting tracked or wheeled vehicles and marines from amphibious assault ships to beachheads.
***Landing Craft Mechanized is a landing craft designed for carrying vehicles during amphibious assaults.
***Landing ship, tank is the naval designation for ships first developed during World War II to support amphibious operations by carrying tanks, armoured fighting vehicles, transport vehicles, cargo, and landing troops directly onto shore with no docks or piers.
**Landing Craft Support were two distinct classes of amphibious warfare vessels used by the United States Navy during World War II to support landing crafts.
* Capital ship, the largest and most important ships in a nation&#x27;s fleet. These were previously battlecruisers, battleships, and aircraft carriers, but the first two warship types are now no longer used.
** Aircraft carrier, a warship primarily armed with carrier-based aircraft.
*** Fleet carrier is an aircraft carrier designed to operate with the main fleet of a nation&#x27;s navy.
*** Light aircraft carrier is an aircraft carrier that is smaller than the standard carriers of a navy.
*** Escort carrier, also called a &quot;jeep carrier&quot; or &quot;baby flattop&quot; is a slow type of aircraft carrier used during WWII.
*** Anti-submarine warfare carrier is a type of small aircraft carrier whose primary role is as the nucleus of an anti-submarine warfare hunter-killer group.
*** Aircraft cruiser (also known as aviation cruiser or cruiser-carrier) is a type of warship that combines the features of the aircraft carrier and a surface warship, such as a cruiser or battleship.
**** Helicopter cruiser.
*** Helicopter carrier, an aircraft carrier especially suited to carry helicopters and V/STOL aircraft.
***Seaplane tender, a boat or ship that supports the operation of seaplanes. Some of these vessels, also known as seaplane carriers, could not only carry seaplanes but also provided all the facilities needed for their operation; these ships are regarded by some as the first aircraft carriers and became obsolete at the end of the Second World War.
** Battleship, a large, heavily armored warship equipped with many powerful guns. A term which generally post-dates sailing warships.
*** Ironclad battleship, battleships built before the pre-dreadnought in the late 1850s to the early 1890s.
*** Pre-dreadnought battleship, sea-going battleships built to a common design before the launch of dreadnoughts, between the mid-1880s to the early 1900s. Pre-dreadnoughts commonly featured a mixed main battery composed of several different caliber guns.
*** Dreadnought, an early 20th-century battleship, which set the pattern for all subsequent battleship construction. Dreadnoughts differ from pre-dreadnoughts in that they feature an all-big-gun main battery. The advantage lies in that if all the big guns have the same characteristics, only one firing solution will be needed to aim them all.
**** Fast battleships were battleships which emphasized speed without – in concept – undue compromise of either armor or armament.
** Battlecruiser, a ship with battleship-level armament and cruiser-level armour; typically faster than a battleship because the reduction in armour allowed mounting of more powerful propulsion machinery, or the use of a more slender hull shape with a lower drag coefficient.
* Cruiser, a fast, independent warship. Traditionally, cruisers were the smallest warships capable of independent action. As of 2024, only two countries operated active duty vessels formally classed as cruisers: the United States and Russia.
** Guided missile cruisers are cruisers armed anti-ship missiles.
** Torpedo cruiser is a type of cruiser that is armed primarily with torpedoes.
** Armored cruiser was a type of warship of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was designed like other types of cruisers to operate as a long-range, independent warship, capable of defeating any ship apart from a battleship and fast enough to outrun any battleship it encountered.
** Large cruiser is the class of the battlecruiser-sized Alaska-class cruisers of the United States Navy during World War II.
** Heavy cruiser was a type of cruiser, a naval warship designed for long range and high speed, armed generally with naval guns of roughly 203 mm (8 in) caliber; its parameters were dictated by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the London Naval Treaty of 1930.
*** Pocket battleship, nickname for the Deutschland-class heavy cruisers.
** Light cruiser is a type of small or medium-sized warship. The term is a shortening of the phrase &quot;light armored cruiser&quot;, describing a small ship that carried armor in the same way as an armored cruiser: a protective belt and deck.
** Scout cruiser was a type of warship of the early 20th century, which were smaller, faster, more lightly armed and armoured than protected cruisers or light cruisers, but larger than contemporary destroyers. They were used for scouting.
** Protected cruiser is a type of naval cruiser of the late-19th century, gained their description because an armored deck offered protection for vital machine-spaces from fragments caused by shells exploding above them.
** Unprotected cruiser was a type of naval cruiser in use during the early 1870s Victorian or pre-dreadnought era.
** Coastal defence ship were a type of cruiser-sized warship built for the purpose of coastal defense.
* Destroyer, a fast and highly maneuverable warship, traditionally incapable of independent action. Originally developed to counter the threat of torpedo boats, they are now the largest independent warship generally seen on the ocean.
** Guided missile destroyer are destroyers armed with anti-ship missiles.
**Escort destroyer was a small warship built to full naval standards which was optimised for air-defence and anti-submarine duties in wartime, but which retained many of the capabilities of a traditional fleet destroyer, enabling it to conduct operations in conjunction with main fleet units as well as carrying out convoy escort and ASW patrols.
** Destroyer escort was the United States Navy mid-20th-century classification for a 20-knot (37 km/h; 23 mph), warship designed with the endurance necessary to escort mid-ocean convoys of merchant marine ships similar to frigates.
* Frigate, originally a medium-sized sailing ship. Although they date back to the 17th century, frigates in modern navies are typically used to protect merchant ships and other warships.
**Armoured frigate are frigates with armour which was added to ships based on existing frigate and ship of the line designs. The additional weight of the armour on these first ironclad warships meant that they could have only one gun deck, and they were technically frigates, even though they were more powerful than existing ships-of-the-line and occupied the same strategic role.
**Guided missile frigates are frigates armed with anti-ship missiles.
* Corvettes were small ships during the age of sail. The concept was revived again in WWII as a merchant convoy escort and anti-submarine ship. Today they are used for anti-submarine warfare and patrolling.
** Littoral Combat Ship is a United States Navy classification of warships with the size and role of corvettes.
* Fast attack crafts are a small, fast, agile, offensive, often affordable type of warships armed with anti-ship missiles, guns or torpedoes.
** Missile boats are small, fast warship armed with anti-ship missiles.
** Torpedo boat, are small, fast surface vessels designed for launching torpedoes.
***Torpedo ram is a type of torpedo boat combining a ram with torpedo tubes.
***Motor torpedo boat is a type of fast torpedo boat, especially of the mid 20th century.
* Patrol vessels are relatively small naval vessels generally designed for coastal defence, border protection, immigration law-enforcement, search and rescue duties. They may be broadly classified as inshore patrol vessels or offshore patrol vessels. 
* Mine warfare vessels:
** Minesweeper are small warships designed to remove or detonate naval mines. 
** Minehunter are naval vessels that seek, detect, and destroys individual naval mines.
** Mine countermeasures vessels are atype of naval ships designed for the location of and destruction of naval mines which combines the role of a minesweeper and minehunter in one hull.
** Minelayer are naval vessels that plant naval mines offshore.
* Fire ship, a vessel of any sort set on fire and sent into an anchorage or fleet with the intention of causing destruction and chaos. Exploding fire ships are called hellburners. The development of unmanned surface vehicles has revived the use of fire ships.
* Naval drifters are boats built along the lines of a commercial fishing drifter but fitted out for naval purposes.
* Naval trawlers are vessels built along the lines of fishing trawlers but fitted out for naval purposes.
* Armed merchantman is a type of merchant ship equipped with naval guns, usually for defensive purposes, either by design or after the fact.

**Merchant raiders are disguised commerce raiders.
* Gunboats are naval watercraft designed for the express purpose of carrying one or more guns to bombard coastal targets.
** River gunboat is a type of gunboat for riverine use.
** Flat-iron gunboats were a number of classes of coastal gunboats generally characterized by small size, low freeboard, the absence of masts, and the mounting of a single non-traversing large gun, aimed by pointing the vessel.
** Torpedo gunboat were a form of gunboat armed with torpedoes and designed for hunting and destroying smaller torpedo boats.
** Motor gunboat is a type of a fast gunboat armed with machine-guns and autocannons.
* Monitor, a type of small, heavily gunned warships with shallow draft designed for shore bombardment.
**River monitor, a type of monitors used in rivers.
**Breastwork monitor was a modification of the monitor by Sir Edward Reed of the Royal Navy.
* Q-ship, also known as Q-boats, decoy vessels, special service ships, or mystery ships, were heavily armed merchant ships with concealed weaponry, designed to lure submarines into making surface attacks. This gave Q-ships the chance to open fire and sink them.
* Submarine chaser was a small warship used in anti-submarine warfare.
* Armed yachts were modified yachts that were armed with weapons and were typically in the service of a navy.
* Balloon carrier was a type of ship equipped with a hot-air balloon tied to the ship with a rope or cable, which was used for observation. This type of ship was later replaced by seaplane tenders and aircraft carriers.
* Sloop-of-war was a sailing vessel category later revived in WWII as a convoy escort ship.
**Screw sloop was a propeller-driven sloop-of-wars used during the mid-19th Century.
* Ironclad, a wooden warship with external iron plating.
** Casemate ironclad were a type of ironclad gunboats used in the American Civil War.
** Central battery ship in European continental navies, was a development of the (high-freeboard) broadside ironclad of the 1870s
** Turret ship was a 19th-century type of warship, the earliest to have their guns mounted in a revolving gun turret, instead of a broadside arrangement.
** Floating battery is a kind of armed watercraft, often improvised or experimental, which carries heavy armament but has few other qualities as a warship.
* Ship of the line, a sailing warship capable of standing in the line of battle. A direct predecessor to the later battleship.
* Cottonclad warships were steam-powered warships with bales of cotton lining as armour used in the American Civil War. The armaments consisted of a ram, random numbers of different cannons and sharpshooters. 
* Brig of War is a brig armed for use by a navy.
* Bomb vessels were wooden sailing ships which carried mortars instead of cannons.
* Dispatch boats were small boats, and sometimes large ships, tasked to carry military dispatches from ship to ship or from ship to shore or, in some cases from shore to shore. Dispatch boats were employed when other means of transmitting a message was not possible or safe or as quick.
** Aviso, a kind of dispatch boat.
* Man-of-war, a British Navy expression for a sailing warship.
* Grab was a type of ship common on the Malabar Coast in the 18th and 19th centuries. The ghurāb was originally a galley, but the type evolved into sailing ships armed with cannons.
* Gallivat were small, armed type of boats, with sails and oars, armed with swivel guns and used on the Malabar Coast in the 18th and 19th centuries.
* Galleass, a sailing and rowing warship, equally well suited to sailing and rowing.
* Galleon, a 16th-century armed cargo carriers.
* Galley was a type of ship optimised for propulsion by oars. Galleys were historically used for warfare, trade, and piracy.
* War canoe was a kind of watercraft of the canoe type designed and outfitted for warfare using bow, spear and shield wielding warriors. During the gunpowder era a single brass or iron cannon was mounted on the bow or stern along with musketeers. These warships were used by many tribes and cultures all around the globe.
* Longship, a Viking raiding ship.
* East Asian warships:
**Geobukseon (literally Turtle ship) were wooden sail and oar propelled Korean warships armed with cannons.
**Panokseon (literally board roofed ship) were a type of Korean wooden warships propelled by both sailing and rowing armed with cannons and Hwacha multiple rocket launchers.
**Atakebune were wooden oar propelled 16th Century Japanese warships armed with few cannons, arquebusiers, and archers. They were mostly bulky floating fortifications.
**Mengchong (literally Covered Assaulter) was a type of leather-covered assault warship used in the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE in China.
**Louchuan (literally Tower Ship) was a type of warship used as a floating fortress in Ancient China. The Louchuan was meant to board troops onto enemy ships. Although they were also armed with trebuchets for ranged combat.
**Wugongchuan (literally Centipede Ship) was a Chinese oared vessel of the 16th century inspired by the Portuguese galley.
* Hellenistic galleys, warships propelled by oars with a sail for use in favorable winds used in the Mediterranean Sea:
** Bireme, an ancient vessel, propelled by two banks of oars.
** Trireme, an ancient warship propelled by three banks of oars.
** Quadrireme, an ancient warship invented in Carthage with two levels of oarsmen, and was therefore lower than the quinquereme.
** Quinquereme, an ancient warship propelled by three banks of oars. On the upper row, two rowers hold one oar; on the middle row, two rowers; and on the lower row, one man to an oar.
** Hexareme, an ancient warship invented in Syracuse. The exact arrangement of the hexareme&#x27;s oars is unclear. If it evolved naturally from the earlier designs, it would be a trireme with two rowers per oar.
** Septireme, an ancient warship invented by the Macedonia, the septireme was derived by adding a standing rower to the lower level of the hexareme.
** Octeres, very little is known about the octeres, at least two of their type were in the fleet of Philip V of Macedon at the Battle of Chios.
** Enneres, a type of warship whose oaring system may have been a modification of the quadrireme, with two teams of five and four oarsmen.
** Deceres, a type of warship which is present alongside &quot;nines&quot; in the fleet of Antigonus I Monophthalmus in 315 BC. It is most likely that the &quot;ten&quot; was derived from adding another oarsman to the &quot;nine&quot;.
** Tessarakonteres, a very large catamaran galley reportedly built by Ptolemy IV Philopator of Egypt. It had seven naval rams, with one primary, and the deck would have provided a stable platform for catapults that were often mounted on supergalleys. However, the &quot;forty&quot; was likely just a showpiece; Plutarch describes the ship as for exhibition only.
** Lembos, light warships most commonly associated with the vessels used by the Illyrian tribes, chiefly for piracy, in the area of Dalmatia. Was soon adopted by Macedonia, Seleucid Empire, Roman Republic and Sparta.
** Hemiolia, light and fast warship that appeared in the early 4th century BC. It was particularly favoured by pirates in the eastern Mediterranean, but also used by Alexander the Great as far as the rivers Indus and Jhelum, and by the Romans as a troop transport. According to one view, it was manned by half the number of oarsmen to make room for the soldiers. According to another, there were one and a half files of oarsmen on each side, with the additional half file placed amidships, where the hull was wide enough to accommodate them.
** Trihemiolia, this type was classed with the trireme, and had two and a half files of oarsmen on each side. Judging from the Lindos relief and the famous Nike of Samothrace, both of which are thought to represent &quot;trihemioliai&quot;, the two upper files would have been accommodated in an oarbox, with the half-file located beneath them in the classic &quot;thalamitai&quot; position of the trireme.
** Liburna, a type of small galley used for raiding and patrols. It was originally used by the Liburnians, a pirate tribe from Dalmatia, and later used by the Roman Navy. It had one bench with 25 oars on each side, while in the late Roman Republic, it was equipped with two banks of oars (a bireme), remaining faster, lighter, and more agile than triremes.
* Maritime Southeast Asian warships:
**Djong were sailing warships armed with up to a hundred cannons.
**Kakap were small warships used in Maritime Southeast Asia.
**Kelulus were Nusantaran warships used as troop transports and raiding vessels.
**Lancaran were a type of galley warships armed with Cetbang cannons.


==History and evolution of warships==

===First warships===
The first evidence of ships being used for warfare comes from Ancient Egypt, specifically the northern Nile River most likely to defend against Mediterranean peoples. The galley warship most likely originated in Crete an idea which was soon copied and popularized by the Phoenicians. In the time of Mesopotamia, Ancient Persia, Phoenicia, Ancient Greece and the Ancient Rome, warships were always galleys (such as biremes, triremes and quinqueremes): long, narrow vessels powered by banks of oarsmen and designed to ram and sink enemy vessels, or to engage them bow-first and follow up with boarding parties. The development of catapults in the 4th century BC and the subsequent refinement of this technology enabled the first fleets of siege engine - equipped warships by the Hellenistic age. During late antiquity, ramming fell out of use and the galley tactics against other ships used during the Middle Ages until the late 16th century focused on boarding.

===The Age of Sail===

Naval artillery was redeveloped in the 14th century, but cannon did not become common at sea until the guns were capable of being reloaded quickly enough to be reused in the same battle. The size of a ship required to carry a large number of cannons made oar-based propulsion impossible, and warships came to rely primarily on sails. The sailing man-of-war emerged during the 16th century.

By the middle of the 17th century, warships were carrying increasing numbers of cannons on their broadsides and tactics evolved to bring each ship&#x27;s firepower to bear in a line of battle. The man-of-war now evolved into the ship of the line. In the 18th century, the frigate and sloop-of-war – too small to stand in the line of battle – evolved to escort convoy trade, scout for enemy ships and blockade enemy coasts.

===Steel, steam and shellfire===

During the 19th century a revolution took place in the means of marine propulsion, naval armament and construction of warships. Marine steam engines were introduced, at first as an auxiliary force, in the second quarter of the 19th century. The Crimean War gave a great stimulus to the development of guns. The introduction of explosive shells soon led to the introduction of iron, and later steel, naval armour for the sides and decks of larger warships. The first ironclad warships, the French and British , made wooden vessels obsolete. Metal soon entirely replaced wood as the main material for warship construction.

From the 1850s, the sailing ships of the line were replaced by steam-powered battleships, while the sailing frigates were replaced by steam-powered cruisers.
The armament of warships also changed with the invention of the rotating barbettes and turrets, which allowed the guns to be aimed independently of the direction of the ship and allowed a smaller number of larger guns to be carried.

The final innovation during the 19th century was the development of the torpedo and development of the torpedo boat. Small, fast torpedo boats seemed to offer an alternative to building expensive fleets of battleships.
===Pre-dreadnought era===
Pre-dreadnought battleships were sea-going battleships built between the mid- to late- 1880s and 1905, before the launch of HMS Dreadnought in 1906. The pre-dreadnought ships replaced the ironclad battleships of the 1870s and 1880s. Built from steel, protected by case-hardened steel armour, and powered by coal-fired triple-expansion steam engines, pre-dreadnought battleships carried a main battery of very heavy guns in fully-enclosed rotating turrets supported by one or more secondary batteries of lighter weapons. The role of corvettes, sloops and frigates were taken by new types of ships like destroyers, protected cruisers and armoured cruisers. 
===Since 1906===

====The dreadnought era====

Another revolution in capital warship design began shortly after the start of the 20th century, when Britain launched the Royal Navy&#x27;s all-big-gun battleship in 1906. Powered by steam turbines, it was bigger, faster and more heavily gunned than any existing battleships, which it immediately rendered obsolete. It was rapidly followed by similar ships in other countries. The Royal Navy also developed the first battlecruisers. Mounting the same heavy guns as the dreadnoughts on an even larger hull, battlecruisers sacrificed armour protection for speed. Battlecruisers were faster and more powerful than all existing cruisers, but much more vulnerable to shellfire than contemporary battleships. The torpedo-boat destroyer was developed at the same time as the dreadnoughts. Bigger, faster and more heavily gunned than the torpedo boat, the destroyer evolved to protect the capital ships from the menace of the torpedo boat.

At this time, Britain also introduced the use of fuel oil to power steam warships, instead of coal. Oil produced twice as much power per unit weight as coal, and was much easier to handle. Tests were conducted by the Royal Navy in 1904 involving the torpedo-boat destroyer , the first warship powered solely by fuel oil. These proved its superiority, and all warships procured for the Royal Navy from 1912 were designed to burn fuel oil.

====Obsolescence of battleships====

During the lead-up to the Second World War, Germany and the United Kingdom once again emerged as the two dominant Atlantic sea powers. The German navy, under the Treaty of Versailles, was limited to only a few minor surface ships. But the clever use of deceptive terminology, such as &quot;Panzerschiffe&quot; deceived the British and French commands. They were surprised when ships such as , , and raided Allied supply lines. The greatest threat however, was the introduction of the Kriegsmarine&#x27;s largest vessels, and . &quot;Bismarck&quot; was heavily damaged and sunk/scuttled after a series of sea battles in the north Atlantic in 1941, while &quot;Tirpitz&quot; was destroyed by the Royal Air Force in 1944. The British Royal Navy gained dominance of the European theatre by 1943.
The Second World War brought massive changes in the design and role of several types of warships. For the first time, the aircraft carrier became the clear choice to serve as the main capital ship within a naval task force. World War II was the only war in history in which battles occurred between groups of carriers. World War II saw the first use of radar in combat. It brought the first naval battle in which the ships of both sides never engaged in direct combat, instead sending aircraft to make the attacks, as in the Battle of the Coral Sea.
====Cold War-era====
Modern warships are generally divided into seven main categories, which are: aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, corvettes, submarines, and amphibious warfare ships. Battleships comprise an eighth category, but are not in current service with any navy in the world. Only the deactivated American s still exist as potential combatants, and battleships in general are unlikely to re-emerge as a ship class without redefinition. The destroyer is generally regarded as the dominant surface-combat vessel of most modern blue-water navies. However, the once distinct roles and appearances of cruisers, destroyers, frigates, and corvettes have blurred. Most vessels have come to be armed with a mix of anti-surface, anti-submarine and anti-aircraft weapons. Class designations no longer reliably indicate a displacement hierarchy, and the size of all vessel types has grown beyond the definitions used earlier in the 20th century. Another key difference between older and modern vessels is that all modern warships are &quot;soft&quot;, without the thick armor and bulging anti-torpedo protection of World War II and older designs.

Most navies also include many types of support and auxiliary vessels, such as minesweepers, patrol boats and offshore patrol vessels.

By 1982 the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) treaty negotiations had produced a legal definition of what was then generally accepted as a late-twentieth century warship. The UNCLOS definition was : &quot;A warship means a ship belonging to the armed forces of a State bearing the external marks distinguishing such ships of its nationality, under the command of an officer duly commissioned by the government of the State and whose name appears in the appropriate service list or its equivalent, and manned by a crew which is under regular armed forces discipline.&quot;

=====Development of the submarine=====
The first practical submarines were developed in the late 19th century, but it was only after the development of the torpedo that submarines became truly dangerous (and hence useful). By the end of the First World War submarines had proved their potential. During the Second World War Nazi Germany&#x27;s fleet of U-boats (submarines) almost starved Britain into submission and inflicted huge losses on US coastal shipping. The success of submarines led to the development of new anti-submarine convoy escorts during the First and Second World Wars, such as the destroyer escort. Confusingly, many of these new types adopted the names of the smaller warships from the age of sail, such as corvette, sloop and frigate.

=====Development of the aircraft carrier=====
A seaplane tender is a ship that supports the operation of seaplanes. Some of these vessels, known as seaplane carriers, could not only carry seaplanes but also provided all the facilities needed for their operation; these ships are regarded by some as the first aircraft carriers and appeared just before the First World War.

A major shift in naval warfare occurred with the introduction of the aircraft carrier. First at Taranto and then at Pearl Harbor, the aircraft carrier demonstrated its ability to strike decisively at enemy ships out of sight and range of surface vessels. By the end of the Second World War, the carrier had become the dominant warship.

=====Development of the amphibious assault ship=====
 was a ship of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. She was the world&#x27;s first purpose-built landing craft carrier ship, and a pioneer of modern-day amphibious assault ships. During some of her operations, she was known to have used at least four cover names, R1, GL, MT, and Ryujo Maru.

An amphibious warfare ship is an amphibious vehicle warship employed to land and support ground forces, such as marines, on enemy territory during an amphibious assault.
Specialized shipping can be divided into two types, most crudely described as ships and craft. In general, the ships carry the troops from the port of embarkation to the drop point for the assault and the craft carry the troops from the ship to the shore. Amphibious assaults taking place over short distances can also involve the shore-to-shore technique, where landing craft go directly from the port of embarkation to the assault point. Amphibious assault ships have a well deck with landing craft which can carry tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles and also have a deck like a helicopter carrier for helicopters and V/STOL aircraft.

<text>Vaishya (Sanskrit: वैश्य, &quot;vaiśya&quot;) is one of the four varnas of the Vedic Hindu social order in India. Vaishyas are classed third in the order of Varna hierarchy. 

The occupation of Vaishyas consists mainly of agriculture, taking care of cattle, trade and other business pursuits as mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita. 

==Traditional duties==
Hindu religious texts assigned Vaishyas to traditional roles in agriculture and cattle-rearing, but over time they came to be landowners, traders and money-lenders. They ranked third in the varna system below Brahmins and Kshatriyas and traditionally had the responsibility to provide sustenance or patronage for the higher varnas. The Vaishyas, along with members of the Brahmin and Kshatriya varnas, claim &quot;dvija&quot; status (&quot;twice born&quot;, a second or spiritual birth) after sacrament of initiation as in Hindu theology. Indian traders were widely credited for the spread of Indian culture to regions as far as southeast Asia.

Historically, Vaishyas have been involved in roles other than their traditional pastoralism, trade and commerce. According to historian Ram Sharan Sharma, the Gupta Empire was a Vaishya dynasty that &quot;may have appeared as a reaction against oppressive rulers&quot;.

Many Vaishyas are vegetarian due to the influence of Jainism and Buddhism which preaches the concept of ahimsa which forbade killing of animals for food.

<text>Osteoglossiformes , meaning &quot;bony tongues&quot; in Ancient Greek, is a relatively primitive order of ray-finned fish that contains two sub-orders, the Osteoglossoidei and the Notopteroidei. All of at least 245 living species inhabit freshwater. They are found in South America, Africa, Australia and southern Asia, having first evolved in Gondwana before that continent broke up. In 2008, several new species of marine osteoglossiforms were described from the Danish Eocene Fur Formation, dramatically increasing the diversity of this group. This implies that the Osteoglossomorpha is not a primary freshwater fish group with the osteoglossiforms having a typical Gondwana distribution.

The Gymnarchidae (the only species being &quot;Gymnarchus niloticus&quot;, the African knifefish) and the Mormyridae are weakly electric fish able to sense their prey using electric fields.

The mooneyes (Hiodontidae) are often classified here, but may also be placed in a separate order, Hiodontiformes.

Members of the order are notable for having toothed or bony tongues, and for having the forward part of the gastrointestinal tract pass to the left of the oesophagus and stomach (for all other fish it passes to the right). In other respects, osteoglossiform fishes vary considerably in size and form; the smallest is &quot;Pollimyrus castelnaui&quot;, at just long, while the largest, the arapaima (&quot;Arapaima gigas&quot;), reaches as much as .

<text>Schonchin Butte is a cinder cone on the northern flank of Medicine Lake Volcano in the Cascade Range in northern California. Frothy lava, cooled in the air, created the large cinder cones throughout Lava Beds National Monument. It is named for Old Schonchin, a chief of the Modoc people during the late nineteenth century. Erupting more than 30,000 years ago, the volcano spewed ash and cinders into the air much like a can of soda when shaken. A lava spatter rampart is at the very top.

The butte&#x27;s trail leads to a panoramic view from the historic fire lookout. From the lookout panoramic views of the Medicine Lake Volcano, Mount Shasta, Mount McLoughlin, the Clear Lake Hills and the Warner Mountains can be seen. On a really clear day, the south rim of Crater Lake in Oregon is visible.

==Fire lookout==
The Schonchin Butte Fire Lookout is a fire lookout tower on Schonchin Butte, a cinder cone in Lava Beds National Monument.

The Civilian Conservation Corps built a fire lookout at Schonchin Butte during the summers of 1939 and 1940, as part of federal infrastructure development under the President Franklin D. Roosevelt administration during the Great Depression. The site was selected for its view of Lava Beds National Monument, while the United States Forest Service wanted a lookout constructed on Hippo Butte, probably because of its view of the Modoc National Forest. The CCC crew manually carried all materials to the building site after constructing the trail. Roger Reid was the first to staff the lookout in 1941. The 1942 date on the doorstep of the lookout represents when it was installed, not when the lookout was built, or first staffed.

The lookout has changed over the years, but its general appearance and structure have remained relatively unchanged. Linoleum, not carpet, used to cover the building&#x27;s floor, and the furnishings were stained while trim was painted. Early lookouts used a radio phone, and a regular telephone was not installed for several decades. Many original items remain: the Osborne Fire Finder and its stand, the sink, and the insulated stool which lookouts use during thunderstorms.

Through the 1980s, rangers staffed the lookout for extended periods. They used gas for light and cooking, but electricity replaced gas in the 1950s when the National Park Service constructed a power line that ascended the cinder cone&#x27;s east slope. The National Park Service removed the line in the mid-1980s when electric lines were buried along the Monument&#x27;s main road. Solar panels now power a repeater, radio, and small lights.

Maintenance has been done piecemeal from the building&#x27;s creation through the 1990s. By 1992, the building, placed on the National Register of Historic Places, showed signs of its age. In 1993, the Park Service received about $50,000 to restore the lookout. During June and July 1994, maintenance workers stripped the inside of paint and bad sheetrock. They removed old fixtures and a gas stove from the main level and various junk from the basement. The refrigerator was moved to the basement. Helicopters brought dirt and rock for the trail. Workers drained the cistern in the basement and installed new carpets and light fixtures capable of using electricity generated by solar panels.

Schonchin Butte is staffed approximately from May to September from about 10 A.M. to 6 P.M., but park rangers stay longer in cases of extreme fire danger, fire activity, or significant lightning activity. Lookouts no longer live in the building and carry up daily supplies on their backs. The lack of electricity and cooking equipment also limit a lookout&#x27;s tour of duty.

Schonchin Butte appears as a topic in the American Park Network publication &quot;Oh, Ranger!&quot;. The chapter &quot;The Lookout Tower&quot; describes Schonchin Butte and chronicles two storms atop the lookout.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.

The lookout and the trail leading up to it were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during 1939 to 1941.

It is an active fire lookout tower, used during fire seasons.

<doc id="263970" wikidata="Q1368970" url="?curid=263970" title="Volcanic cone">
<text>Volcanic cones are among the simplest volcanic landforms. They are built by ejecta from a volcanic vent, piling up around the vent in the shape of a cone with a central crater. Volcanic cones are of different types, depending upon the nature and size of the fragments ejected during the eruption. Types of volcanic cones include stratocones, spatter cones, tuff cones, and cinder cones.

==Stratocone==
Stratocones are large cone-shaped volcanoes made up of lava flows, explosively erupted pyroclastic rocks, and igneous intrusives that are typically centered around a cylindrical vent. Unlike shield volcanoes, they are characterized by a steep profile and periodic, often alternating, explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions. Some have collapsed craters called calderas. The central core of a stratocone is commonly dominated by a central core of intrusive rocks that range from around to over several kilometers in diameter. This central core is surrounded by multiple generations of lava flows, many of which are brecciated, and a wide range of pyroclastic rocks and reworked volcanic debris. The typical stratocone is an andesitic to dacitic volcano that is associated with subduction zones. They are also known as either &quot;stratified volcano,&quot; &quot;composite cone,&quot; &quot;bedded volcano,&quot; &quot;cone of mixed type&quot; or &quot;Vesuvian-type volcano.&quot;

==Spatter cone==

A spatter cone is a low, steep-sided hill or mound that consists of welded lava fragments, called &quot;spatter,&quot; which has formed around a lava fountain issuing from a central vent. Typically, spatter cones are about high. In case of a linear fissure, lava fountaining will create broad embankments of spatter, called &quot;spatter ramparts,&quot; along both sides of the fissure. Spatter cones are more circular and cone shaped, while spatter ramparts are linear wall-like features.

Spatter cones and spatter ramparts are typically formed by lava fountaining associated with mafic, highly fluid lavas, such as those erupted in the Hawaiian Islands. As blobs of molten lava, &quot;spatter,&quot; are erupted into the air by a lava fountain, they can lack the time needed to cool completely before hitting the ground. Consequently, the spatter are not fully solid, like taffy, as they land and they bind to the underlying spatter as both often slowly ooze down the side of the cone. As a result, the spatter builds up a cone that is composed of spatter either agglutinated or welded to each other.

==Tuff cones==

A tuff cone, sometimes called an ash cone, is a small monogenetic volcanic cone produced by phreatic (hydrovolcanic) explosions directly associated with magma brought to the surface through a conduit from a deep-seated magma reservoir. They are characterized by high rims that have a maximum relief of above the crater floor and steep slopes that are greater than 25 degrees. They typically have a rim to rim diameter of . A tuff cone consists typically of thick-bedded pyroclastic flow and surge deposits created by eruption-fed density currents and bomb-scoria beds derived from fallout from its eruption column. The tuffs composing a tuff cone have commonly been altered, palagonitized, by either its interaction with groundwater or when it was deposited warm and wet. The pyroclastic deposits of tuff cones differ from the pyroclastic deposits of spatter cones by their lack or paucity of lava spatter, smaller grain-size, and excellent bedding. Typically, but not always, tuff cones lack associated lava flows.

A tuff ring is a related type of small monogenetic volcano that is also produced by phreatic (hydrovolcanic) explosions directly associated with magma brought to the surface through a conduit from a deep-seated magma reservoir. They are characterized by rims that have a low, broad topographic profiles and gentle topographic slopes that are 25 degrees or less. The maximum thickness of the pyroclastic debris comprising the rim of a typical tuff ring is generally thin, less than to thick. The pyroclastic materials that comprise their rim consist primarily of relatively fresh and unaltered, distinctly and thin-bedded volcanic surge and air fall deposits. Their rims also can contain variable amounts of local country rock (bedrock) blasted out of their crater. In contrast to tuff cones, the crater of a tuff ring generally has been excavated below the existing ground surface. As a result, water commonly fills a tuff ring&#x27;s crater to form a lake once eruptions cease.

Both tuff cones and their associated tuff rings were created by explosive eruptions from a vent where the magma is interacting with either groundwater or a shallow body of water as found within a lake or sea. The interaction between the magma, expanding steam, and volcanic gases resulted in the production and ejection of fine-grained pyroclastic debris called &quot;ash&quot; with the consistency of flour. The volcanic ash comprising a tuff cone accumulated either as fallout from eruption columns, from low-density volcanic surges and pyroclastic flows, or combination of these. Tuff cones are typically associated with volcanic eruptions within shallow bodies of water and tuff rings are associated with eruptions within either water saturated sediments and bedrock or permafrost.

Next to spatter (scoria) cones, tuff cones and their associated tuff rings are among the most common types of volcanoes on Earth. An example of a tuff cone is Diamond Head at Waikīkī in Hawaii. Clusters of pitted cones observed in the Nephentes/Amenthes region of Mars at the southern margin of the ancient Utopia impact basin are currently interpreted as being tuff cones and rings.

==Cinder cone==


Cinder cones, also known as scoria cones and less commonly scoria mounds, are small, steep-sided volcanic cones built of loose pyroclastic fragments, such as either volcanic clinkers, cinders, volcanic ash, or scoria. They consist of loose pyroclastic debris formed by explosive eruptions or lava fountains from a single, typically cylindrical, vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as either cinders, clinkers, or scoria around the vent to form a cone that often is noticeably symmetrical; with slopes between 30 and 40°; and a nearly circular ground plan. Most cinder cones have a bowl-shaped crater at the summit. The basal diameters of cinder cones average about and range from . The diameter of their craters ranges between . Cinder cones rarely rise more than or so above their surroundings.

Cinder cones most commonly occur as isolated cones in large basaltic volcanic fields. They also occur in nested clusters in association with complex tuff ring and maar complexes. Finally, they are also common as parasitic and monogenetic cones on complex shield and stratovolcanoes. Globally, cinder cones are the most typical volcanic landform found within continental intraplate volcanic fields and also occur in some subduction zone settings as well. Parícutin, the Mexican cinder cone which was born in a cornfield on February 20, 1943, and Sunset Crater in Northern Arizona in the US Southwest are classic examples of cinder cones, as are ancient volcanic cones found in New Mexico&#x27;s Petroglyph National Monument. Cone-shaped hills observed in satellite imagery of the calderas and volcanic cones of Ulysses Patera, Ulysses Colles and Hydraotes Chaos are argued to be cinder cones.

Cinder cones typically only erupt once like Parícutin. As a result, they are considered to be monogenetic volcanoes and most of them form monogenetic volcanic fields. Cinder cones are typically active for very brief periods of time before becoming inactive. Their eruptions range in duration from a few days to a few years. Of observed cinder cone eruptions, 50% have lasted for less than 30 days, and 95% stopped within one year. In case of Parícutin, its eruption lasted for nine years from 1943 to 1952. Rarely do they erupt either two, three, or more times. Later eruptions typically produce new cones within a volcanic field at separation distances of a few kilometers and separate by periods of 100 to 1,000 years. Within a volcanic field, eruptions can occur over a period of a million years. Once eruptions cease, being unconsolidated, cinder cones tend to erode rapidly unless further eruptions occur.

==Rootless cones==

Rootless cones, also called pseudocraters, are volcanic cones that are not directly associated with a conduit that brought magma to the surface from a deep-seated magma reservoir. Generally, three types of rootless cones, littoral cones, explosion craters, and hornitos are recognized. Littoral cones and explosion craters are the result of mild explosions that were generated locally by the interaction of either hot lava or pyroclastic flows with water. Littoral cones typically form on the surface of a basaltic lava flow where it has entered into a body of water, usually a sea or ocean. Explosion craters form where either hot lava or pyroclastic flows have covered either marshy ground or water-saturated ground of some sort. Hornitos are rootless cones that are composed of welded lava fragments and were formed on the surface of basaltic lava flows by the escape of gas and clots of molten lava through cracks or other openings in the crust of a lava flow.

<text>Hiodontiformes is an order of ray-finned fish consisting of the two living species of the mooneye family, Hiodontidae, and three extinct genera. 

These are traditionally classified within the order Osteoglossiformes, a placement some authorities still follow. Fossil study of the extinct genus &quot;Yanbiania&quot; suggests that the hiodontids separated from other osteoglossomorphs early and thus may deserve a separate order.

<doc id="263977" wikidata="Q1293908" url="?curid=263977" title="Edward Tufte">
<text>Edward Rolf Tufte (; born March 14, 1942), sometimes known as &quot;ET&quot;, is an American statistician and professor emeritus of political science, statistics, and computer science at Yale University. He is noted for his writings on information design and as a pioneer in the field of data visualization.

== Early life and education ==
Edward Rolf Tufte was born in 1942 in Kansas City, Missouri, to Virginia Tufte (1918–2020) and Edward E. Tufte (1912–1999). He grew up in Beverly Hills, California, where his father was a longtime city official. He graduated from the public Beverly Hills High School.

Tufte received a BS and a MS in statistics from Stanford University, and a Doctor of Philosophy in political science from Yale University. His dissertation was completed in 1968 and titled &quot;The Civil Rights Movement and Its Opposition&quot;.

== Career ==
Tufte was hired in 1967 by the Woodrow Wilson School of Princeton University as a lecturer in politics and public affairs, where he steadily moved up to the rank of full Professor in 1972. He taught courses there in political economy and data analysis while publishing three quantitatively inclined political science books.

In 1975, while at Princeton, Tufte was asked to teach a statistics course to a group of journalists who were visiting the school to study economics. He developed a set of readings and lectures on statistical graphics, which he further developed in joint seminars he taught with renowned statistician John Tukey, a pioneer in the field of information design. These course materials became the foundation for Tufte&#x27;s first book on information design, &quot;The Visual Display of Quantitative Information&quot;.

In 1977, Tufte left Princeton University for Yale University, where he accepted an appointment as Professor of Political Science, Statistics, and Computer Science, as well as a Senior Critic at the Yale School of Art.

After negotiations with major publishers failed, Tufte decided to self-publish the book &quot;The Visual Display of Quantitative Information&quot; in 1982, working closely with graphic designer Howard Gralla. Tufte financed the work by taking out a second mortgage on his home. The book quickly became a commercial success and secured Tufte&#x27;s transition from political scientist to information expert.

In 1999, after 22 years of service at Yale University, his professorship at Yale was made Emeritus.

On March 5, 2010, President Barack Obama appointed Tufte to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act&#x27;s Recovery Independent Advisory Panel &quot;to provide transparency in the use of Recovery-related funds&quot;.

== Infographic work ==
Tufte is an expert in the presentation of infographics such as charts and diagrams, and is a fellow of the American Statistical Association. He has held fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences.

=== Information design ===

Tufte&#x27;s writing is important in such fields as information design and visual literacy, which deal with the visual communication of information. He coined the word &quot;chartjunk&quot; to refer to useless, non-informative, or information-obscuring elements of quantitative information displays. Tufte&#x27;s other key concepts include what he calls the &quot;lie factor&quot;, the &quot;data-ink ratio&quot;, and the &quot;data density&quot; of a graphic.

Tufte uses the term &quot;data-ink ratio&quot; to argue against using excessive decoration in visual displays of quantitative information. In &quot;Visual Display&quot;, Tufte explains, &quot;Sometimes decoration can help editorialize about the substance of the graphic. But it is wrong to distort the data measures—the ink locating values of numbers—in order to make an editorial comment or fit a decorative scheme.&quot;

Tufte encourages the use of data-rich illustrations that present all available data. When such illustrations are examined closely, every data point has a value, but when they are looked at more generally, only trends and patterns can be observed. Tufte suggests these macro/micro readings be presented in the space of an eye-span, in the high resolution format of the printed page, and at the unhurried pace of the viewer&#x27;s leisure.

Tufte uses several historical examples to make his case. These include John Snow&#x27;s cholera outbreak map, Charles Joseph Minard&#x27;s &quot;Carte Figurative&quot;, early space debris plots, Galileo Galilei&#x27;s &quot;Sidereus Nuncius&quot;, and Maya Lin&#x27;s Vietnam Veterans Memorial. For instance, the listing of the names of deceased soldiers on the black granite of Lin&#x27;s sculptural memorial is shown to be more powerful as a chronological list rather than as an alphabetical one. The sacrifice each fallen individual has made is thus highlighted within the overall time scope of the war. In &quot;Sidereus Nuncius&quot;, Galileo presents the nightly observations of the moons of Jupiter in relation to the body itself, interwoven with the two-month narrative record.

=== Criticism of PowerPoint ===
Tufte has criticized the way Microsoft PowerPoint is typically used. In his essay &quot;The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint&quot;, Tufte criticizes many aspects of the software:
* Its use as a way to guide and reassure a presenter, rather than to enlighten the audience;
* Its unhelpfully simplistic tables and charts, a design decision holdover from the low resolution of early computer displays;
* The outliner&#x27;s causing ideas to be arranged in an artificially deep hierarchy, itself subverted by the need to restate the hierarchy on each slide;
* Enforcement of the audience&#x27;s lockstep linear progression through that hierarchy (whereas with handouts, readers could browse and relate items at their leisure);
* Poor typography and chart layout, from presenters who are poor designers or who use poorly designed templates and default settings (in particular, difficulty in using scientific notation);
* Simplistic thinking—from ideas being squashed into bulleted lists; and stories with a beginning, middle, and end being turned into a collection of disparate, loosely disguised points—presenting a misleading façade of objectivity and neutrality that people associate with science, technology, and &quot;bullet points&quot;.

Tufte cites the way PowerPoint was used by NASA engineers in the events leading to the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster as an example of PowerPoint&#x27;s many problems. The software style is designed to persuade rather than to inform people of technical details. Tufte&#x27;s analysis of a NASA PowerPoint slide is included in the Columbia Accident Investigation Board’s report -- including an engineering detail buried in small type on a crowded slide with six bullet points, that if presented in a regular engineering white paper, might have been noticed and the disaster prevented.

Instead, Tufte argues that the most effective way of presenting information in a technical setting, such as an academic seminar or a meeting of industry experts, is by distributing a brief written report that can be read by all participants in the first 5 to 10 minutes of the meeting. Tufte believes that this is the most efficient method of transferring knowledge from the presenter to the audience and then the rest of the meeting is devoted to discussion and debate.

=== Small multiple ===
One method Tufte encourages to allow quick visual comparison of multiple series is the small multiple, a chart with many series shown on a single pair of axes that can often be easier to read when displayed as several separate pairs of axes placed next to each other. He suggests this is particularly helpful when the series are measured on quite different vertical (&quot;y&quot;-axis) scales, but over the same range on the horizontal &quot;x&quot;-axis (usually time).

=== Sparkline ===

Sparklines are a condensed way to present trends and variation, associated with a measurement such as average temperature or stock market activity, often embedded directly in the text; for example: The Dow Jones index for February 7, 2006 . These are often used as elements of a small multiple with several lines used together. Tufte explains the sparkline as a kind of &quot;word&quot; that conveys rich information without breaking the flow of a sentence or paragraph made of other &quot;words&quot; both visual and conventional. To date, the earliest known implementation of sparklines was conceived by interaction designer Peter Zelchenko and implemented by programmer Mike Medved in early 1998.

=== Sculpture ===
Beyond his academic endeavors over the years, Tufte has created sculptures, often large outdoor ones made of metal or stone, that were first primarily exhibited on his own rural Connecticut property. In 2009–10, some of these artworks were exhibited at the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield, Connecticut, in the one-man show &quot;Edward Tufte: Seeing Around&quot;.

====Hogpen Hill Farms====
Hogpen Hill Farms, the Tufte sculpture garden in Woodbury, Connecticut, is open to the public on summer weekends.

====ET Modern====
In 2010, Edward Tufte opened a gallery, ET Modern, in New York City&#x27;s Chelsea Art District&quot; at 11th Avenue and 20th Street. The gallery closed in 2013.

<text>Hiodontidae, commonly called mooneyes, is a family of ray-finned fish with a single included genus Hiodon. The genus comprise two extant species native to North America and three to five extinct species recorded from Paleocene to Eocene age fossils. They are large-eyed, fork-tailed fish that superficially resemble shads. The vernacular name comes from the metallic shine of their eyes.

The higher classification of the mooneyes is not yet fully established. Some sources have place them in their own order, [[Hiodontiformes]], while others retain them in the order [[Osteoglossiformes]].

==Species==
*&quot;Hiodon alosoides&quot; 
The goldeye, &quot;Hiodon alosoides&quot;, is widespread across eastern North America, and is notable for a conspicuous golden iris in the eyes. It prefers turbid slower-moving waters of lakes and rivers, where it feeds on a wide variety of organisms including insects, crustaceans, small fish, and mollusks. The fish has been reported up to in length.

*†&quot;Hiodon consteniorum&quot; 
*†&quot;Hiodon falcatus&quot; 
*†&quot;Hiodon rosei&quot; 
*&quot;Hiodon tergisus&quot; 
The mooneye, &quot;Hiodon tergisus&quot;, is also widespread across eastern North America, living in the clear waters of lakes, ponds, and rivers. It consumes aquatic invertebrates, insects, and fish. Mooneyes can reach in length.

*†&quot;Hiodon woodruffi&quot; 
An Early Eocene, Ypresian to Late Eocene, Lutetian species. &quot;Hiodon woodruffi&quot; was described from fossils found in the Klondike Mountain Formation, Washington and Horsefly shale, British Columbia. Further finds have increased the known paleogeographic range to include the Kishenehn Formation of northwestern Montana.

*?†&quot;Hiodon shuyangensis&quot;

<text>Sebastiano Ziani was Doge of Venice from 1172 to 1178. He was one of the Venice&#x27;s greatest city planners.

As Doge Ziani divided the city-state into many districts. He donated a piece of land to the city-state and relocated its shipyard there. He funded the construction of the Piazza San Marco. Projects included filling up Rio Batario that ran parallel to the Basilica San Marco which could be found at what is today the half way point of the Piazza. He paved the main square as well as the Piazzetta that it is connected to. Ziani hired an engineer to erect two columns (possibly of Greek origin) that stand at the head of the Piazzetta facing the lagoon.

He also hosted Pope Alexander III, the Emperor Frederick I, and the delegation of William II of Sicily for the signing of the Treaty of Venice in July 1177.

Ziani was married to a woman named Cecilia.

<doc id="263982" wikidata="Q649722" url="?curid=263982" title="Caesarius of Heisterbach">
<text>Caesarius of Heisterbach (c. 1180 – c. 1240), sometimes erroneously called, in English, Caesar of Heisterbach, was the prior of a Cistercian monastery, Heisterbach Abbey, which was located in the Siebengebirge, near the small town of Oberdollendorf, Germany.

==Life==
Born about 1170 at or near Cologne, he was educated at the Cathedral School, where he studied the theology of St. Ambrose, St. Augustine, St. Jerome, and St. Gregory the Great; the philosophy of Boethius, and the literary masterpieces of Virgil, Ovid, Seneca, and Claudian. He was a gifted and diligent scholar and upon the completion of his studies was thoroughly conversant with the writings of the Fathers of the Church and master of a refined and fluent Latin style.

Acting on the advice of Gevard, Abbot of Heisterbach, Caesarius entered that monastery in 1199 and after some time was appointed master of novices. It was his duty to imbue the candidates with the spirit of austere asceticism which then animated the Cistercian Order, and to instruct them in the necessary knowledge of theology. 

Caesarius of Heisterbach is remembered for a paradoxical maxim concerning the rise and decline of monasteries according to which discipline causes prosperity in a monastery, and prosperity undermines discipline. He also gave the name of Titivillus as the demon who caused typographical errors in the work of scribes. 

He is further known for having attributed a famous declaration to Arnaud Amalric, a leader in the Albigensian Crusade. Upon being asked how to distinguish Cathars from Catholics at the besieged town of Béziers, Arnaud supposedly replied &quot;Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius&quot;, which translates as: &quot;Slay them all, God will recognize his own.&quot; This statement is often cited as &quot;Kill them all and let God sort them out.&quot; The historicity of the statement has been questioned, but Arnaud&#x27;s alleged order as reported by Caesarius was likely seen at the time as reflecting highly on Arnaud. Both Arnaud and Caesarius were Cistercians, with Arnaud the head of the Cistercian Order at the time of Caesarius&#x27; writing, and Caesarius required an imprimatur. The incident was further included as an exemplum in Caesarius&#x27;s Book of Miracles because (to Cistercians at least) it reflected well on Arnaud.

Heisterbach Abbey was dissolved in 1803, and the library and archives were given to the city of Düsseldorf. The monastery and the church were sold and demolished in 1809, only the ruined apse with fragments of the choir remaining. In 1897 a monument was erected nearby in honour of Caesarius.

==Writings==
His fame as teacher soon spread far beyond the walls of his monastery and, yielding to requests from various quarters, Abbot Henry, Gevard&#x27;s successor, asked Caesarius to write an abstract of his teachings.

As an author, Caesarius of Heisterbach is best known as the compiler of a book of hagiography, the &quot;Dialogus miraculorum&quot; (ca. 1219-1223), a collection of 746 miracle stories arranged according to twelve distinctions. The tales are told in the form of dialogues between a monk and a novice. The work was often referred to by preachers seeking material for sermons in the Late Middle Ages. It was extremely popular and was widely distributed, and its popularity was rivaled only, perhaps, by the &quot;Golden Legend&quot; of Jacobus de Voragine. A vision reported in the book provided the source for the iconography of the Virgin of Mercy.

The first writings of Caesarius were sermons, which he wrote for his own use. But it was not long before his fellow monks approached him with requests for elaboration and explanation. His ninth book was written because his fellow monks asked him for a simple and clearly understandable explanation of the Maria sequence &quot;Ave preclara maris stella&quot;. His other writings were responses to requests. 

Caesarius often complained that his works were taken out of his hand, unfinished and uncorrected. They were extremely well-known and popular, and some sixty known transcriptions of the &quot; Dialogus miraculorum &quot; preceded the publication of a critical edition.

In his sermons Caesarius treats passages from the Bible, often examining psalms or parts of them. He also relates the movements of heavenly bodies to the destinies of men. His homilies, on the other hand, deal with the evangelical texts of the Sundays and festivals throughout the entire Church year, and are to be regarded as theological tracts and meditations rather than sermons and speeches. They are directed not to laymen, but to monks and novices of the Cistercian Order. The interpretations often deal with the lives of monks.
The writings of Caesarius are of considerable importance for the study of medieval homiletics.

<text>Tony MacAlpine (born August 29, 1960) is an American musician and composer. In a career spanning four decades, he has released twelve studio albums. MacAlpine is best known as an instrumental rock and heavy metal solo guitarist, although he has worked with many different bands and musicians in guest appearances and collaborations.

==Biography==
Having started playing piano at the age of five and guitar at twelve, MacAlpine studied classical piano and violin for a number of years at the Springfield Conservatory of Music in Massachusetts, as well as various music programs at the University of Hartford in Connecticut. One of his musical influences is Frédéric Chopin, to whom he pays homage in his interpretations of the latter&#x27;s études, which are featured on the majority of his studio albums.

Together with his first studio releases, &quot;Edge of Insanity&quot; (1986) and &quot;Maximum Security&quot; (1987), he had a prominent role on other works during the popular shred era, including keyboard performances on the debut albums of fellow guitarists Vinnie Moore (&quot;Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot;, 1986) and Joey Tafolla (&quot;Out of the Sun&quot;, 1987). Soon after his own debut, he played guitar in a heavy metal supergroup named M.A.R.S. (MacAlpine/Aldridge/Rock/Sarzo), which resulted in the 1986 album &quot;Project: Driver&quot;.

As part of a band effort named &#x27;MacAlpine&#x27;, &quot;Eyes of the World&quot; was released in 1990 as a more commercially oriented attempt to emulate other hard rock acts at the time. The venture was short-lived, and his subsequent album &quot;Freedom to Fly&quot; (1992) was a return to his instrumental-based work. A further consecutive string of instrumental albums followed throughout the 1990s, most of them through the renowned Shrapnel Records label: &quot;Madness&quot; (1993), &quot;Premonition&quot; (1994), &quot;Evolution&quot; (1995) and &quot;Violent Machine&quot; (1996). For his last album of the decade, &quot;Master of Paradise&quot; (1999), MacAlpine briefly assumed singing duties in an effort to experiment with different styles. After the release of &quot;Chromaticity&quot; in August 2001, he took an extended hiatus from recording solo albums and worked with a variety of other musicians and bands, most notably with supergroups CAB and Ring of Fire. Nearly a decade later, in June 2011, he released his self-titled eleventh studio album through guitarist Steve Vai&#x27;s Favored Nations label.

From 2001 to 2005, MacAlpine played both guitar and keyboards in Vai&#x27;s touring band The Breed. He is featured on the band&#x27;s DVD release &quot;Live at the Astoria London&quot; (2003), along with two DVDs of the G3 tour: &quot;G3: Live in Denver&quot; (2004) and &quot;G3: Live in Tokyo&quot; (2005). During that time, he was also the guitarist for progressive metal supergroup Planet X, alongside keyboardist Derek Sherinian and drummer Virgil Donati. He played with them for three albums in the first part of the decade—&quot;Universe&quot; (2000), &quot;Live from Oz&quot; (2002) and &quot;MoonBabies&quot; (2002)—and rejoined them in 2009 for a string of live performances, and at that time a possible new album. His most recent collaborations have included Seven the Hardway, a progressive metal group with whom he released their self-titled album in 2010, and a guest appearance on Sherinian&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;Oceana&quot; (2011). In the second half of 2012, MacAlpine toured Europe and Asia as part of PSMS (Portnoy/Sheehan/MacAlpine/Sherinian), an instrumental supergroup. &quot;Instrumental Inspirations&quot;, a DVD of their live material, was released October 21, 2012. Additionally, in an October 2012 interview, he stated that he was working on new studio material (one of them being a &quot;strictly classical record&quot; recorded solely on piano), as well as a new album with Ring of Fire. &quot;Battle of Leningrad&quot;, Ring of Fire&#x27;s fourth studio album, was released on January 28, 2014.

MacAlpine&#x27;s twelfth studio album, &quot;Concrete Gardens&quot;, was released on April 21, 2015.

==Style and influence==
MacAlpine was highly influential in the neoclassical metal genre, becoming known for his instrumental rock style of playing that displays highly advanced shred techniques; one of his most oft-used techniques being &#x27;sweep tapping&#x27;, a variation of sweep picking. He has incorporated elements of classical, jazz, fusion, hard rock and heavy metal on both guitar and keyboard, and has been described as a virtuoso by Jason Ankeny at AllMusic.

MacAlpine became a prominent user of seven-string guitars after joining Planet X and still plays them regularly, along with eight-string guitars. A long-time endorsee of Carvin guitars (notably the T-Mac and DC series), he switched to Ibanez in 2010. Since 2011 he has played a customized RG Prestige eight-string model with EMG pickups, while his seven- and six-string models use DiMarzios. For amplification, he uses the Hughes &amp; Kettner TriAmp for studio recording and the Coreblade model for live touring. An Ernie Ball wah and volume pedal completes his live setup. A detailed diagram of his 2011 gear can be found at Guitar Geek.

==Personal life==
MacAlpine currently resides in Pasadena, California. On August 25, 2015, he posted on his Facebook profile that he may have developed colon cancer, which forced cancellation of some dates on his tour to promote &quot;Concrete Gardens&quot;. In August 2016 he wrote on his personal website, &quot;I have been feeling back to normal and tests indicate that all is well in medical land. Deep and sincere thanks to you all for your wonderful support through this very difficult last 12 months.&quot;

MacAlpine also revealed in an interview with Herman Li that, among his traumatic experiences, his wife had died and the release of his new record was a way for him to get back into creativity.

<text>Ghettotech (also known as Detroit club) is a genre of electronic music originating from Detroit. It combines elements of Chicago&#x27;s ghetto house with electro, Detroit techno, and Miami bass.

==Overview==
Former Detroit music journalist for the &quot;Detroit Metro Times&quot;, Hobey Echlin describes ghettotech as a genre that combines &quot;techno&#x27;s fast beats with rap&#x27;s call-and-response.&quot; It features four-on-the-floor rhythms and is usually faster than most other dance music genres, at roughly 145 to 160 BPM. Vocals are often repetitive, crude, and pornographic. As DJ Godfather puts it, &quot;the beats are really gritty, really raw, nothing polished.&quot;

Ghettotech was born as a DJing style in the late 1980s, inspired by the eclecticism of The Electrifying Mojo and the fast-paced mixing and turntablism of Jeff &quot;The Wizard&quot; Mills. DJs would mix multiple genres including jungle, ghetto house, hip hop, R&amp;B, electro and Detroit techno. The music of 2 Live Crew is also cited as influential to the genre.

A Detroit ghettotech style of dancing is called the jit. This dance style relies heavily on fast footwork combinations, drops, spins and improvisations. The roots of jit date back to Detroit jitterbugs in the 1970s. Chicago&#x27;s equivalent dance style is Juke, where the focus is on footwork dating back to the late 1980s.

Ghettotech was an integral part of the Detroit Electronic Music Festival, an annual event.

<text>Hazel Dorothy Scott (June 11, 1920 – October 2, 1981) was a Trinidadian jazz and classical pianist and singer. She was an outspoken critic of racial discrimination and segregation. She used her influence to improve the representation of Black Americans in film.

Born in Port of Spain, Scott moved to New York City with her mother at the age of four. Scott was a child musical prodigy, receiving scholarships to study at the Juilliard School when she was eight. In her teens, she performed at Café Society while still at school. She also performed on the radio.

She was active as a jazz singer throughout the 1930s and 1940s. In 1950, she became the first black American to host her own TV show, &quot;The Hazel Scott Show&quot;. Her career in the United States faltered after she testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1950 during the era of McCarthyism. Scott subsequently moved to Paris, France, in 1957 and began performing in Europe, not returning to the United States until 1967.

==Early life==
Born in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, on June 11, 1920, Hazel Dorothy Scott was the only child of R. Thomas Scott, a West African scholar from Liverpool, England, and Alma Long Scott, a classically trained pianist, and music teacher. In 1924, the family moved from Trinidad to the United States and settled in Harlem, New York City. Her parents had separated by this time, and Scott lived with her mother and grandmother.

By now, Scott could play anything she heard on the piano. With her mother&#x27;s guidance and training, she mastered advanced piano techniques and was labeled a child prodigy. When Scott was eight years old, she began studying with Professor Paul Wagner of the Juilliard School of Music. In 1933, her mother organized her own Alma Long Scott&#x27;s All-Girl Jazz Band, where Scott played the piano and trumpet.

==Career==

By the age of 16, Hazel Scott regularly performed for radio programs for the Mutual Broadcasting System, gaining a reputation as the &quot;hot classicist&quot;. In the mid-1930s, she also performed at the Roseland Dance Hall with the Count Basie Orchestra. Her early musical theatre appearances in New York included the &quot;Cotton Club Revue of 1938&quot;, &quot;Sing Out the News&quot; and &quot;The Priorities of 1942&quot;.

Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Scott performed jazz, blues, ballads, Broadway and boogie-woogie songs, and classical music in various nightclubs. Barney Josephson, the owner of the black and tan club, Café Society, hired her and, from 1939 to 1943, she was a leading attraction at both the downtown and uptown branches of Café Society. Her performances created national prestige for the practice of &quot;swinging the classics&quot;. By 1945, Scott was earning $75,000 ($ today) a year.

Along with Lena Horne, Scott was one of the first black women to gain respectable roles in major Hollywood pictures. She refused to take roles in Hollywood playing a &quot;singing maid&quot;, and she turned down the first four roles she was offered for this reason. When she began performing in Hollywood films, she insisted on having final cut privileges when it came to her appearance. She performed as herself in the films &quot;I Dood It&quot; (MGM, 1943), &quot;Broadway Rhythm&quot; (MGM, 1944) with Lena Horne, in the otherwise all-white cast of &quot;The Heat&#x27;s On&quot; (Columbia, 1943), &quot;Something to Shout About&quot; (Columbia, 1943), and &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; (Warner Bros, 1945). She appeared in five Hollywood films in all, always insisting on the credit line &quot;Miss Hazel Scott as Herself&quot;, and wearing her own clothes and jewelry to protect her image. Her final break with Columbia Pictures&#x27; Harry Cohn involved &quot;a costume which she felt stereotyped blacks&quot;. In the 1940s, in addition to her film appearances, she was featured in Café Society&#x27;s &quot;From Bach to Boogie-Woogie&quot; concerts in 1941 and 1943 at Carnegie Hall.

She was the first person of African descent to have their own television show in America, &quot;The Hazel Scott Show&quot;, which premiered on the DuMont Television Network on July 3, 1950. &quot;Variety&quot; reported that &quot;Hazel Scott has a neat little show in this modest package,&quot; its &quot;most engaging element&quot; being Scott herself. The show became so popular, it soon ran three times a week. On the show, Scott performed with the jazz musicians Charles Mingus and Max Roach who were among the members of her supporting band.

==Activism and blacklisting==
===Civil rights===
Scott had long been committed to civil rights. Scott refused to perform in segregated venues when she was on tour. She was once escorted from the city of Austin, Texas by Texas Rangers because she refused to perform when she discovered that black and white patrons were seated separately. &quot;Why would anyone come to hear me, a Negro,&quot; she told &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;and refuse to sit beside someone just like me?&quot;

In 1949, Scott brought a suit against the owners of a Pasco, Washington restaurant when a waitress refused to serve Scott and her traveling companion, Mrs. Eunice Wolfe, because &quot;they were Negroes&quot;. Scott&#x27;s victory helped African Americans challenge racial discrimination in Spokane, as well as inspiring civil rights organizations &quot;to pressure the Washington state legislature to enact the Public Accommodations Act&quot; in 1953.

===McCarthyism===
With the advent of the Red Scare in the television industry, Scott&#x27;s name appeared in &quot;Red Channels: A Report on Communist Influence in Radio and Television&quot; in June 1950. In an effort to clear her name, Scott voluntarily appeared before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) on September 22, 1950, and insisted on reading a prepared statement. She denied that she was &quot;ever knowingly connected with the Communist Party or any of its front organizations.&quot; However, she stated that she had supported Communist Party member Benjamin J. Davis&#x27;s run for City Council, arguing that Davis was supported by socialists, a group that &quot;has hated Communists longer and more fiercely than any other.&quot; She also expressed her frustrations with the mass amount of false accusations of entertainers and offered the suggestion to use &quot;democratic methods to immediately eliminate a good many irresponsible charges.&quot; Scott concluded her statement to the HUAC with a request that entertainers be not already &quot;covered with the mud of slander and the filth of scandal&quot; when proving their loyalty to the United States.

Her television variety program, &quot;The Hazel Scott Show&quot;, was cancelled a week after Scott appeared before HUAC, on September 29, 1950. (Her program predated Nat King Cole&#x27;s show by six years.) Scott suffered a nervous breakdown in 1951. On returning to full health, Scott continued to perform in the United States and Europe, even getting sporadic bookings on television variety shows like &quot;Cavalcade of Stars&quot; and guest starring in an episode of CBS Television&#x27;s &quot;Faye Emerson&#x27;s Wonderful Town&quot; musical series. Scott&#x27;s short-lived television show &quot;provided a glimmer of hope for African American viewers&quot; during a time of continued racial bias in the broadcasting industry and economic hardships for jazz musicians in general. Scott remained publicly opposed to McCarthyism and racial segregation throughout her career.
===In France (1957–67)===
To evade political fallout in the United States, Scott moved to Paris in 1957. She appeared in the French Gilles Grangier crime film &quot;Le désordre et la nuit&quot; (1958). In 1963, she marched with a number of other African-American expatriates, including James Baldwin, to the US Embassy in Paris to demonstrate support of the upcoming March on Washington.

===Later US years (1967–81)===
She did not return to the US until 1967. By this time, the Civil Rights Movement had led to federal legislation making racial segregation in housing and public accommodations illegal and enforcing the protection of voting rights of all citizens in addition to other social advances.

Scott continued to perform occasionally in nightclubs, while also appearing on daytime television, until the year of her death. She made her television acting debut in 1970, performing as Dolly Martin in the NBC drama &quot;The Bold Ones: The New Doctors,&quot; the &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Sing, I&#x27;ll Listen&quot; episode. In 1973 on the ABC daytime soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, she performed a wedding song at the nuptials of her &quot;onscreen cousin&quot; Carla Gray Hall, portrayed by Ellen Holly.

==Personal life==
Although a Catholic, Scott in 1945 married Baptist minister and US Congressman Adam Clayton Powell. The couple had one child, Adam Clayton Powell III, but divorced in 1960 after a separation. Their relationship provoked controversy, as Powell was married when their affair began. At the end of 1960, Powell married his secretary.

On January 19, 1961, Scott married Ezio Bedin, a Swiss-Italian comedian who was 15 years her junior; they divorced a few years later, before her return to the U.S.

===Bahá&#x27;í Faith===
Scott had heard about the Bahá&#x27;í Faith from her longtime friend Dizzy Gillespie, who joined the religion in early 1968. Following heartfelt conversations with him, she joined the faith in late 1968. While she was at Vic Damone&#x27;s career re-announcement in late 1968, she was introduced by Damone to the crowd recalling how he was an usher for her show. This might have been the November 1942 performance by Scott and others at the Paramount Theatre. Damone shared with the crowd that she had just recently been at a Bahá&#x27;í fireside, an informational meeting of the religion, at his home and had joined the religion – Scott was very moved and in tears. Scott also sang at an October 1970 award dinner in New York – singing &quot;When the World was Young&quot;, &quot;A Lonely Christmas&quot;, &quot;Put a Little Love in Your Heart&quot; for an International Education Year Award to James L. Olivero, who remembered Louis Gregory, presented by Daniel Jordan of the Bahá&#x27;ís on behalf of the US National Spiritual Assembly. Her singing was praised by Whitney Young, executive director of the National Urban League, who was speaking at the event. A musicale was held in Kingston, Jamaica, in May 1971, entitled &quot;The Sounds of a New World&quot;, co-presented by Scott with Dizzy Gillespie, Seals and Crofts, and Linda Marshall and others, as part of a ship-and-shore conference of Bahá&#x27;ís.

===Death===
On October 2, 1981, Hazel Scott died of cancer at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 61 years old. She is buried at Flushing Cemetery in Queens, New York, near other musicians including Louis Armstrong, Johnny Hodges, and Dizzy Gillespie (who died in 1993).

==Legacy==
Scott was renowned as a virtuosic jazz pianist, in addition to her successes in dramatic acting and classical music. She also used her status as one of the best-known African-American entertainers of her generation to shine a spotlight on issues of racial injustice and civil rights.
Scott recorded as the leader of various groups for Decca, Columbia and Signature, among them a trio that consisted of Bill English and the double-bass player Martin Rivera, and another trio with Charles Mingus on bass and Rudie Nichols on drums. Her 1955 album &quot;Relaxed Piano Moods&quot; on the Debut label, with Mingus and Roach, is generally her work most highly regarded by critics today. Her unique swinging style and fusion of jazz and classical influences kept her in demand for performances through the very end of her life. Alicia Keys cited Scott as her inspiration for her performance at the 61st Grammy Awards, saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve been thinking about people who inspire me; shout out to Hazel Scott, I&#x27;ve always wanted to play two pianos.&quot;

In 2020, she was the subject of the BBC World Service programme &quot;Hazel Scott: Jazz star and barrier breaker&quot; in the series &quot;The Forum&quot;.

In &quot;When Women Invented Television&quot;, author Jennifer Keishin Armstrong features her as one of four women who had a major influence on the medium.

In 2022, Dance Theatre of Harlem debuted a new ballet about the life of Hazel Scott.

On February 21, 2025, the American Masters documentary &quot;The Disappearance of Miss Scott&quot; aired on PBS stations.

<text>Verona ( ; ; or ) is a city on the River Adige in Veneto, Italy, with 258,031 inhabitants. It is one of the seven provincial capitals of the region, and is the largest city municipality in the region and in northeastern Italy. The metropolitan area of Verona covers an area of and has a population of 714,310 inhabitants. It is one of the main tourist destinations in Northern Italy because of its artistic heritage and several annual fairs and shows as well as the opera season in the Arena, an ancient Roman amphitheater.

Between the 13th and 14th centuries, the city was ruled by the della Scala family. Under the rule of the family, in particular of Cangrande I della Scala, the city experienced great prosperity, becoming rich and powerful and being surrounded by new walls. The della Scala era is preserved in numerous monuments around Verona.

Two of William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays are set in Verona: &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (which also features Romeo&#x27;s visit to Mantua) and &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot;. It is unknown if Shakespeare ever visited Verona or Italy, but his plays have lured many visitors to Verona and surrounding cities. Verona was also the birthplace of Isotta Nogarola, who is said to be the first major female humanist and one of the most important humanists of the Renaissance. In November 2000, the city was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO because of its urban structure and architecture.

The city is scheduled to host the 2026 Winter Olympics closing ceremonies.

==History==

The precise details of Verona&#x27;s early history remain a mystery along with the origin of its name. One theory is that it was a city of the Euganei, who were obliged to give it up to the Cenomani (550 BC). With the conquest of the Valley of the Po, the Veronese territory became Roman about 300 BC. Verona became a Roman in 89 BC. It was classified as a &quot;municipium&quot; in 49 BC, when its citizens were ascribed to the Roman tribe &quot;Poblilia&quot; or &quot;Publicia&quot;.

The city became important because it was at the intersection of several roads. Stilicho, a military commander in the Roman army, defeated Alaric and his Visigoths here in 402. Later, Verona was conquered by the Ostrogoths in 489, and the Gothic domination of Italy began. Theoderic the Great was said to have built a palace there. It remained under the power of the Goths throughout the Gothic War (535–552), except for a single day in 541, when the Byzantine officer Artabazes made an entrance. The defections of the Byzantine generals over the booty made it possible for the Goths to regain possession of the city. In 552 the Romans under the general Valerian vainly endeavored to enter the city, but it was only when the Goths were fully overthrown that they surrendered it.

In 569, it was taken by Alboin, King of the Lombards, in whose kingdom it was, in a sense, the second most important city. There, Alboin was &quot;killed by his own people with the connivance of his wife&quot; in 572. The dukes of Treviso often resided there. Adalgisus, son of Desiderius, in 774 made his last resistance in Verona to Charlemagne, who had destroyed the Lombard kingdom. Verona became the ordinary residence of the kings of Italy, the government of the city becoming hereditary in the family of Count Milo, progenitor of the counts of San Bonifacio. From 880 to 951 the two Berengarii resided there.

Under Holy Roman and Austrian rule, Verona was alternatively known in German as , or . Otto I ceded to Verona the marquisate dependent on the Duchy of Bavaria, however, the increasing wealth of the burgher families eclipsed the power of the counts, and in 1135 Verona was organised as a free commune. In 1164 Verona joined with Vicenza, Padua and Treviso to create the Veronese League, which was integrated with the Lombard League in 1167 to battle against Frederick I Barbarossa. Victory was achieved at the Battle of Legnano in 1176, and the Treaty of Venice signed in 1177 followed by the Peace of Constance in 1183.

When Ezzelino III da Romano was elected &quot;podestà&quot; in 1226, he converted the office into a permanent lordship. In 1257 he caused the slaughter of 11,000 Paduans on the plain of Verona (Campi di Verona). Upon his death, the Great Council elected Mastino I della Scala as podestà, and he converted the &quot;signoria&quot; into a family possession, though leaving the burghers a share in the government. Failing to be re-elected podestà in 1262, he affected a coup d&#x27;état, and was acclaimed Capitano del Popolo, with the command of the communal troops. Long internal discord took place before he succeeded in establishing this new office, to which was attached the function of confirming the podestà. In 1277, Mastino della Scala was killed by the faction of the nobles.

The reign of his son Alberto della Scala as capitano (1277–1302) was a time of incessant war against the counts of San Bonifacio, who were aided by the House of Este. Of his sons, Bartolomeo, Alboino and Cangrande I della Scala (1291–1329), only the last shared the government (1308); he was great as warrior, prince, and patron of the arts; he protected Dante, Petrarch, and Giotto. By war or treaty, he brought under his control the cities of Treviso (1308), Vicenza (1311), and Padua (1328). At that time before the Black Death, the city was home to more than 40,000 people.

Cangrande was succeeded by Mastino II (1329–1351) and Alberto, sons of Alboino. Mastino continued his uncle&#x27;s policy, conquering Brescia in 1332 and carrying his power beyond the Mincio. He purchased Parma (1335) and Lucca (1339). After the King of France, he was the richest prince of his time. A powerful league was formed against him in 1337 – Florence, Venice, the Visconti, the Este, and the Gonzaga. After a three-year war, the Scaliger dominions were reduced to Verona and Vicenza (Mastino&#x27;s daughter Regina-Beatrice della Scala married to Barnabò Visconti). Mastino&#x27;s son Cangrande II (1351–1359) was a cruel, dissolute, and suspicious tyrant; not trusting his own subjects, he surrounded himself with Brandenburgian mercenaries. He was killed by his brother Cansignorio (1359–1375), who beautified the city with palaces, provided it with aqueducts and bridges, and founded the state treasury. He also killed his other brother, Paolo Alboino. Fratricide seems to have become a family custom, for Antonio (1375–1387), Cansignorio&#x27;s natural brother, slew his brother Bartolomeo, thereby arousing the indignation of the people, who deserted him when Gian Galeazzo Visconti of Milan made war on him. Having exhausted all his resources, he fled from Verona at midnight on 19 October 1387, thus putting an end to the Scaliger domination, which, however, survived in its monuments.

The year 1387 is also the year of the Battle of Castagnaro, fought between Giovanni Ordelaffi for Verona and John Hawkwood for Padua. The latter emerged as the winner.

Antonio&#x27;s son Canfrancesco attempted in vain to recover Verona (1390). Guglielmo (1404), natural son of Cangrande II, was more fortunate; with the support of the people and the Carraresi, he drove out the Milanese, but he died ten days after. After a period of Cararrese rule, Verona submitted to Venice (1405). The last representatives of the Scaligeri lived at the imperial court and repeatedly attempted to recover Verona by the aid of popular risings.

From 1508 to 1517, the city was in the power of the Emperor Maximilian I. There were numerous outbreaks of the plague, and in 1629–1633, Italy was struck by its worst outbreak in modern times. Around 33,000 people died in Verona (over 60% of the population at the time) in 1630–1631.

In 1776, a method of bellringing was developed called Veronese bellringing art. Verona was occupied by Napoleon in 1797, but on Easter Monday the populace rose and drove out the French. It was then that Napoleon made an end of the Venetian Republic. Verona became Austrian territory when Napoleon signed the Treaty of Campo Formio in October 1797. The Austrians took control of the city on 18 January 1798. It was taken from Austria by the Treaty of Pressburg in 1805 and became part of Napoleon&#x27;s Kingdom of Italy, but was returned to Austria following Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in 1814, when it became part of the Austrian-held Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia.

The Congress of Verona, which met on 20 October 1822, was part of the series of international conferences or congresses, opening with the Congress of Vienna in 1814–1815, that marked the continuing enforcement of the &quot;Concert of Europe&quot;.

In 1866, following the Third Italian War of Independence, Verona, along with the rest of Venetia, became part of a united Italy.

The advent of fascism added another dark chapter to the annals of Verona. Throughout Italy, the Jewish population was hit by the Manifesto of Race, a series of anti-Semitic laws passed in 1938, and after the invasion by Nazi Germany in 1943, deportations to Nazi concentration camps. An Austrian Fort (now a church, the Santuario della Madonna di Lourdes), was used to incarcerate and torture Allied troops, Jews and anti-fascists, especially after 1943, when Verona became part of the Italian Social Republic.

During Austrian rule Verona became of great strategic importance to the regime. Galeazzo Ciano, Benito Mussolini&#x27;s son-in-law, was accused of plotting against the republic; in a show trial staged in January 1944 by the Nazi and fascist hierarchy at Castelvecchio (the Verona trial), Ciano was executed on the banks of the Adige with many other officers on what is today Via Colombo. This marked another turning point in the escalation of violence that would only end with the final liberation by allied troops and partisans on 26 April 1945.

After World War II, as Italy joined the NATO alliance, Verona once again acquired its strategic importance, due to its geographical closeness to the Iron Curtain. The city became the seat of SETAF (South European Allied Terrestrial Forces) and had during the whole duration of the Cold War period a strong military presence, especially American, which has since decreased.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Verona has a humid subtropical climate characteristic of Northern Italy&#x27;s inland plains, with hot summers and cool, humid winters, even though Lake Garda has a partial influence on the city. The relative humidity is high throughout the year, especially in winter when it causes fog, mainly from dusk until late morning, although the phenomenon has become less and less frequent in recent years.

==Demographics==

In 2009, 265,368 people were residing in Verona, located in the province of Verona, Veneto, of whom 47.6% were male and 52.4% were female. Minors (children aged 0–17) totaled 16.05% of the population compared to pensioners who numbered 22.36%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners). The average age of Verona residents is 43 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Verona grew by 3.05%, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.85%. The current birth rate of Verona is 9.24 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births., 87% of the population was Italian. The largest immigrant group comes from other European nations (the largest coming from Romania): 3.60%, South Asia: 2.03%, and sub-saharan Africa 1.50%. The city is predominantly Roman Catholic, but due to immigration now has some Orthodox Christian, and Muslim followers.

==Government==

Since the local government political reorganization in 1993, Verona has been governed by the City Council of Verona, which is based in &quot;Palazzo Barbieri&quot;. Voters elect directly 33 councilors and the mayor of Verona every five years.

Verona is also the capital of its own province. The Provincial Council is seated in &quot;Palazzo del Governo&quot;. The current mayor of Verona is Damiano Tommasi, elected on 26 June 2022.

Verona has traditionally been a right-wing traditionalist Catholic city, reflecting its former status as one of the major cities of Italian Social Republic, and the right-wing politics of the Veneto region. In October 2018, Verona became the first city in Italy to declare itself pro-life, and hosted the American Christian right lobby group World Congress of Families&#x27; conference in 2019. Despite this, since the mayors became directly elected in 1994, the city has elected two left-wing mayors - Paolo Zanotto in 2002 and current mayor Damiano Tommasi in 2022, largely due to incumbent mayor Federico Sboarina&#x27;s refusal to include center-right parties in his right-wing coalition.

==Main sights==
Because of the value and importance of its many historical buildings, Verona has been named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Verona preserved many ancient Roman monuments (including the magnificent Arena) in the early Middle Ages, but many of its early medieval edifices were destroyed or heavily damaged by the earthquake of 3 January 1117, which led to a massive Romanesque rebuilding. The Carolingian period &quot;Versus de Verona&quot; contains an important description of Verona in the early medieval era.

===Roman edifices===

The Roman military settlement in what is now the center of the city was to expand through the cardines and decumani that intersect at right angles. This structure has been kept to the present day and is clearly visible from the air. Further development has not reshaped the original map. Though the Roman city with its basalt-paved roads is mostly hidden from view it stands virtually intact about 6 m below the surface. Most palazzi and houses have cellars built on Roman structures that are rarely accessible to visitors.

Verona is famous for its Roman amphitheater, the Arena, found in the city&#x27;s largest piazza, the Piazza Bra. Completed around 30 AD, it is the third-largest in Italy after Rome&#x27;s Colosseum and the Amphitheatre of Capua. It measures 139 meters long and 110 meters wide, and could seat some 25,000 spectators in its 44 tiers of marble seats. The &quot;ludi&quot; (shows and gladiator games) performed within its walls were so famous that they attracted spectators from far beyond the city. The current two-story façade is actually the internal support for the tiers; only a fragment of the original outer perimeter wall in white and pink limestone from Valpolicella, with three stories remains. The interior is very impressive and is virtually intact, and has remained in use even today for public events, fairs, theatre, and open-aired opera during warm summer nights.

Piazza delle Erbe, near the Roman forum was rebuilt by Cangrande I and Cansignorio della Scala I, lords of Verona, using material (such as marble blocks and statues) from Roman spas and villas.

There is also a variety of other Roman monuments to be found in the town, such as the Roman theatre of Verona. This theatre was built in the 1st century BC, but through the ages had fallen in disuse and had been built upon to provide housing. In the 18th century Andrea Monga, a wealthy Veronese, bought all the houses that in time had been built over the theatre, demolished them, and saved the monument. Not far from it is the Ponte di Pietra (&quot;Stone Wall Bridge&quot;), another Roman landmark that has survived to this day.

The &quot;Arco dei Gavi&quot; was built in the 1st century AD and is famous for having the name of the builder (architect Lucius Vitruvius Cordone) engraved on it, a rare case in the architecture of the epoque. It originally straddled the main Roman road into the city, now Corso Cavour. It was demolished by French troops in 1805 and rebuilt in 1932.

Nearby is the &quot;Porta Borsari&quot;, an archway at the end of Corso Porta Borsari. This is the façade of a 3rd-century gate in the original Roman city walls. The inscription is dated 245 AD and gives the city name as &quot;Colonia Verona Augusta&quot;. Corso Porta Borsari, the road passing through the gate is the original Via Sacra of the Roman city. Today, it is lined with several Renaissance palazzi and the ancient Church of Santi Apostoli, a few meters from Piazza delle Erbe.

&quot;Porta Leoni&quot; is the 1st century BC ruin of what was once part of the Roman city gate. A substantial portion is still standing as part of the wall of a medieval building. The street itself is an open archaeological site, and the remains of the original Roman street and gateway foundations can be seen a few feet below the present street level. As can be seen from there, the gate contains a small court guarded by towers. Here, carriages and travelers were inspected before entering or leaving the city.

The &quot;Santo Stefano&quot; church is dedicated to the first Christian martyr, was erected in the Paleochristian era, and houses the burials of the first bishops of Verona. Throughout the centuries Saint Stephen underwent complex architectural transformations. Particularly striking is the rare two-story ambulatory, probably built to give pilgrims visual access to the abundant collection of important relics for which the church was famous. Also to be visited is the cruciform crypt with its forest of columns, arches, and cross vaults. Saint Stephen was the first Christian martyr and, according to the Acts of the Apostles, was stoned just outside Jerusalem, in a place still remembered today, near the so-called &quot;Porta Leoni&quot;.

===Medieval architecture===

The &quot;Basilica of San Zeno Maggiore&quot; is a Romanesque style church, the third such structure on its site, built from 1123 to 1135, over the 4th-century shrine to Verona&#x27;s patron saint, St. Zeno (bishop of Verona from 362 to 380 when he died). The façade dominates the large square, and is flanked with a 72-meter-tall bell tower, which is mentioned by Dante in Canto 18 of Purgatory in the Divine Comedy. The weathered Veronese stone gives a warm golden glow, and the restrained lines of the pillars, columns, and cornices, and the gallery with its double windows, give the façade an air of harmonious elegance. The huge rose window is decorated as a Wheel of Fortune. The lintels above the portal have carvings of the months of the year. Each side of the doorway is embellished with 18 bas-relief panels of biblical scenes, and the inner bronze door panels have 48 primitive but forceful depictions of Biblical scenes and episodes from the life of St Zeno. The meaning of some of the scenes is now unknown, but the extraordinarily vivid energy of the figures is a superb blend of traditional and Ottonian influences. The interior of the church is divided into the Lower Church, occupying about ⅔ of the structure, and the Upper Church, occupying the remainder. The walls are covered with 12th and 14th century frescos and the ceiling of the nave is a magnificent example of a ship&#x27;s keel ceiling. The vaulted crypt contains the tomb of St. Zeno, the first Bishop of Verona, as well as the tombs of several other saints. North of the church is a pleasant cloister. The church also houses the tomb of King Pippin of Italy (777–810).
Piazza dei Signori is an elegant medieval square with various buildings and towers. It has a monument dedicated to Dante Alighieri.

The &quot;Basilica of San Lorenzo&quot; is another Romanesque church, albeit smaller. It dates from around 1177, but was built on the site of a Paleochristian church, fragments of which remain. The church is built of alternating tracks of brick and stone, and has two cylindrical towers, housing spiral staircases to the women&#x27;s galleries. The interior is sober but still quiet. The striped bands of stone and brick and the graceful arches complement the setting.

&quot;Santa Maria Antica&quot; is a small Romanesque church that served as the private chapel of the Scaligeri clan, and is famous for the Gothic Scaliger Tombs.

The &quot;Verona Cathedral&quot;, also known as the Duomo, is a notable Romanesque church.

Sant&#x27;Anastasia is a huge and lofty church built from 1290 to 1481 by the Dominicans to hold the massive congregations attracted by their sermons. The Pellegrini chapel houses the fresco &quot;St. George and the Princess of Trebizond&quot; by Pisanello as well as the grave of Wilhelm von Bibra. An art festival is held in the square each May.

The Castelvecchio Bridge, also known as Ponte Scaligero, is a segmental arch bridge. At the time of its completion in 1356, it was the world&#x27;s largest bridge arch. It has a span length of .

==Sport==
The city has two professional football teams. Historically, the city&#x27;s major team has been Hellas Verona. They won the Italian Serie A championship in 1984–85 and played in the European Cup the following year. Chievo Verona represented Chievo, a suburb of Verona, and was created in 1929. However, they ceased to exist in 2021 due to outstanding tax payments. As of the 2021–22 season, Hellas plays in the first division of Italian football, Serie A, while Virtus Verona, the other club in the city, plays in the Serie C. The teams of Hellas and Chievo contested the Derby della Scala and shared the 38,402-seater Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi (now only home to Hellas due to the folding of Chievo), which was used as a venue at the 1990 FIFA World Cup.

Verona is home to the volleyball team Verona Volley (now in Serie A1), the rugby team Franklin and Marshall Cus Verona Rugby (now in Serie A1), and the basketball team Scaligera Basket (now in Legadue).

The city has twice hosted the UCI Road World Championships, in 1999 (with Treviso as co-host) and in 2004. The city also regularly hosts stages of the Giro d&#x27;Italia annual cycling race. Verona also hosted the baseball world cup in 2009, and the Volleyball World Cup in September–October 2010. Verona is hosting the Volleyball Women&#x27;s World Championship in September–October 2014.

==Infrastructure and transport==
===Public transit===

Public transit has been operated by the provincial public transport company, &quot;Azienda Trasporti Verona&quot; (ATV), since 2007. From 1884 to 1951, the city was served by the . Trolleybuses replaced the trams which were themselves replaced by buses in 1975. A new trolleybus network is currently under construction by ATV and is expected to open in 2026.

An incline lift, the Verona funicular, opened in 2017 and provides access from the Ponte Pietra to the Roman theatre museum and San Pietro Castle.

===Railways===

Verona lies at a major route crossing where the north–south rail line from the Brenner Pass to Rome intersects with the east–west line between Milan and Venice, giving the city rail access to most of Europe. In addition to regional and local services, the city is served by direct international trains to Zurich, Innsbruck, and Munich. ÖBB nightjet provides overnight sleeper service via Verona on its La Spezia to Wien and München lines.

Verona&#x27;s main station is Verona Porta Nuova railway station, to the south of the city center. It is considered to be the ninth busiest railway station in Italy, handling approximately 68,000 passengers per day, or 25 million passengers per year.

There is a lesser station to the east of the city at Porta Vescovo, which used to be the main station in Verona, but now only receives trains between Venice and Porta Nuova.

===Airport===

Verona Airport is located southwest of Verona. It handles around 3 million passengers per year. It is linked to Porta Nuova railway station by a frequent bus service.

There are direct flights between Verona and Rome Fiumicino, Munich, Berlin, Moscow, Naples, Frankfurt, Catania, London Gatwick, Dublin, Palermo, Cork, Manchester, Liverpool and Cagliari among others.

<text>Nájera () is a small town, former bishopric and now Latin Catholic titular see, former capital of the Kingdom of Najera-Pamplona, located in the &quot;Rioja Alta&quot; region of La Rioja, northern Spain, on the river Najerilla. Nájera is a stopping point on the French Way the most popular path on the Way of St James.

== History ==
The area attracted the Romans, who built the town of Tritium on land which now falls within the boundaries of Nájera and the neighboring municipality of Tricio. Subsequently, the area was under Muslim rule and the name Nájera (&quot;Naxara&quot;, meaning &quot;town between the rocks&quot;) is of Arabic origin.

The town, while still an Islamic possession, was the location of the legendary 3-day struggle between Roland, one of Charlemagne&#x27;s nobles, and the Islamic giant Ferragut.

The town was conquered by Ordoño II of Leon for Navarre in 923. Nájera was the capital city of the Kingdom of Najera-Pamplona until it was conquered by Castile in 1054 after the battle of Atapuerca. However, it continued to be multicultural. For example, in 1142 the French abbot Peter the Venerable used his visit to Spain to commission translations of important Islamic works, including the first translation of the Qur&#x27;an into a European language, and it has been suggested he met with his four translators at Nájera.
From the tenth century onward, Nájera had a prosperous Jewish community, which was granted relatively favorable legal status after the Christian conquest. Letters from the Jewish community in Nájera have been found in the Cairo Geniza.

Edward, the Black Prince fought in the Battle of Nájera in 1367, intervening in a Castilian Civil War on behalf of Pedro I of Castile.

<text>Lena Mary Calhoun Horne (June 30, 1917 – May 9, 2010) was an American singer, actress, dancer and civil rights activist. Horne&#x27;s career spanned more than seventy years and covered film, television and theatre.

Horne joined the chorus of the Cotton Club at the age of sixteen and became a nightclub performer before moving on to Hollywood and Broadway. A groundbreaking African-American performer, Horne advocated for civil rights and took part in the March on Washington in August 1963. Later she returned to her roots as a nightclub performer and continued to work on television while releasing well-received record albums. She announced her retirement in March 1980, but the next year starred in a one-woman show, &quot;Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music&quot;, which ran for more than 300 performances on Broadway. She then toured the country in the show, earning numerous awards and accolades. Horne continued recording and performing sporadically into the 1990s, retreating from the public eye in 2000.

== Early life ==
Lena Horne was born in Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn to Edwin and Edna Horne on June 30, 1917. Both sides of her family were biracial African Americans. She belonged to the well-educated upper stratum of Black New Yorkers at the time. She lived the first five years of her life in a brownstone at 519 Macon Street.

Horne&#x27;s father, Edwin Fletcher &quot;Teddy&quot; Horne Jr. (1893–1970), a one-time owner of a hotel and restaurant, was a gambler. Teddy Horne left the family when Lena was three years old and moved to an upper-middle-class African-American community in the Hill District of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Her mother, Edna Louise Scottron, was an actress with a Black theatre and traveled extensively. Edna&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Amelie Louise Ashton, was from modern Senegal. Horne had a paternal great-grandmother who was a Blackfoot Indian. Horne was raised mainly by her paternal grandparents, Cora Calhoun and Edwin Horne.

When Horne was five she was sent to live in Georgia. For several years she traveled with her mother. From 1927 to 1929 she lived with her uncle, Frank S. Horne. He was the dean of students at Fort Valley Junior Industrial Institute (now part of Fort Valley State University) in Fort Valley, Georgia, and later served as an adviser to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. From Fort Valley, southwest of Macon, Horne briefly moved to Atlanta with her mother; they returned to New York when Horne was twelve years old, after which Horne attended St Peter Claver School in Brooklyn.

Horne then attended Girls High School, an all-girls public high school in Brooklyn, which later became Boys and Girls High School; she dropped out at age 16. At the age of 18 she moved to her father&#x27;s home in Pittsburgh, staying in the city&#x27;s Hill District for almost five years and learning music from native Pittsburgers Billy Strayhorn and Billy Eckstine, among others.

== Career ==

=== Road to Hollywood ===
In the fall of 1933, Horne joined the chorus line of the Cotton Club, a ‘black and tan club’ in New York City. In the spring of 1934, she had a featured role in the Cotton Club Parade starring Adelaide Hall, who took Lena under her wing. Horne made her first screen appearance as a dancer in the musical short &quot;Cab Calloway&#x27;s Jitterbug Party&quot; (1935). A few years later, Horne joined Noble Sissle&#x27;s Orchestra, with which she toured and with whom she made her first records, issued by Decca. After she separated from her first husband, Horne toured with bandleader Charlie Barnet in 1940–41, but disliked the travel and left the band to work at the Cafe Society in New York. She replaced Dinah Shore as the featured vocalist on NBC&#x27;s popular jazz series &quot;The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street&quot;. The show&#x27;s resident maestros, Henry Levine and Paul Laval, recorded with Horne in June 1941 for RCA Victor. Horne left the show after only six months when she was hired by former Cafe Trocadero (Los Angeles) manager Felix Young to perform in a Cotton Club-style revue on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood.


Horne already had two low-budget movies to her credit: a musical feature called &quot;The Duke is Tops&quot; (1938, later reissued with Horne&#x27;s name above the title as &quot;The Bronze Venus&quot;); and a two-reel short subject, &quot;Boogie Woogie Dream&quot; (1941), featuring pianists Pete Johnson and Albert Ammons. Horne&#x27;s songs from &quot;Boogie Woogie Dream&quot; were later released individually as soundies. Horne made her Hollywood nightclub debut at Felix Young&#x27;s Little Troc on the Sunset Strip in January 1942. A few weeks later, she was signed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. In November 1944, she was featured in an episode of the popular radio series &quot;Suspense&quot;, as a fictional nightclub singer, with a large speaking role along with her singing. In 1945 and 1946, she sang with Billy Eckstine&#x27;s Orchestra.

She made her debut at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in &quot;Panama Hattie&quot; (1942) and performed the title song of &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; (1943) based loosely on the life of Adelaide Hall, for 20th Century Fox, while on loan from MGM. She appeared in several MGM musicals, including &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot; (1943) with an entirely African-American cast. She was otherwise not featured in a leading role because of her ethnicity and the fact that her films were required to be re-edited for showing in cities where theaters would not show films with Black performers. As a result, most of Horne&#x27;s film appearances were stand-alone sequences that had no bearing on the rest of the film, so editing caused no disruption to the storyline. One number from &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot; was cut before release because it was considered too suggestive by the censors: Horne singing &quot;Ain&#x27;t It the Truth&quot; while taking a bubble bath. This scene and song are featured in the film &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment! III&quot; (1994), which also featured commentary from Horne on why the scene was deleted prior to the film&#x27;s release. Horne was the first African-American person elected to serve on the Screen Actors Guild board of directors.

In &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; (1946), she performed &quot;Love&quot; by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane. Horne lobbied for the role of Julie LaVerne in MGM&#x27;s version of &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1951), having already played the role when a segment of &quot;Show Boat&quot; was performed in &quot;Till the Clouds Roll By&quot;, but lost the part to Ava Gardner, a friend in real life. Horne claimed this was due to the Production Code&#x27;s ban on interracial relationships in films, although MGM sources state she was never considered for the role. In the documentary &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment! III,&quot; Horne stated that MGM executives required Gardner to practice her singing using Horne&#x27;s recordings, which offended both actresses. Ultimately, Gardner&#x27;s voice was overdubbed by actress Annette Warren (Smith) for the theatrical release.

=== Changes of direction ===
Horne became disenchanted with Hollywood and increasingly focused on her nightclub career. She made only two major appearances for MGM during the 1950s: &quot;Duchess of Idaho&quot; (1950, which was also Eleanor Powell&#x27;s final film); and the musical &quot;Meet Me in Las Vegas&quot; (1956). She said she was &quot;tired of being typecast as a Negro who stands against a pillar singing a song. I did that 20 times too often.&quot; She was blacklisted during the 1950s for her affiliations in the 1940s with communist-backed groups. She would subsequently disavow communism. She returned to the screen, playing Claire Quintana, a madam in a brothel who marries Richard Widmark, in the film &quot;Death of a Gunfighter&quot; (1969), her first straight dramatic role with no reference to her color. She later appeared on screen two more times as Glinda in &quot;The Wiz&quot; (1978), which was directed by her then son-in-law Sidney Lumet, and co-hosting the MGM retrospective &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment! III&quot; (1994), in which she related her unkind treatment by the studio.

After leaving Hollywood, Horne established herself as one of the premier nightclub performers of the post-war era. She headlined at clubs and hotels throughout the U.S., Canada, and Europe, including the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas, the Cocoanut Grove in Los Angeles, and the Waldorf-Astoria in New York. In 1957, a live album entitled, &quot;Lena Horne at the Waldorf-Astoria,&quot; became the biggest-selling record by a female artist in the history of the RCA Victor label at that time. In 1958, Horne became the first African-American woman to be nominated for a Tony Award for &quot;Best Actress in a Musical&quot;, for her part in the &quot;Calypso&quot; musical &quot;Jamaica&quot; (which, at Horne&#x27;s request featured her longtime friend Adelaide Hall).

From the late 1950s through to the 1960s, Horne was a staple of TV variety shows, appearing multiple times on Perry Como&#x27;s &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot;, &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;, and &quot;The Bell Telephone Hour&quot;. Other programs she appeared on included &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;, and &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;. Besides two television specials for the BBC (later syndicated in the U.S.), Horne starred in her own U.S. television special in 1969, &quot;Monsanto Night Presents Lena Horne&quot;. During this decade, the artist Pete Hawley painted her portrait for RCA Victor, capturing the mood of her performance style.

In 1970, she co-starred with Harry Belafonte in the hour-long &quot;Harry &amp; Lena&quot; special for ABC; in 1973, she co-starred with Tony Bennett in &quot;Tony and Lena&quot;. Horne and Bennett subsequently toured the U.S. and U.K. in a show together. In the 1976 program &quot;America Salutes Richard Rodgers&quot;, she sang a lengthy medley of Rodgers songs with Peggy Lee and Vic Damone. Horne also made several appearances on &quot;The Flip Wilson Show&quot;. Additionally, Horne played herself on television programs such as &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, and &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; in the 1970s, as well as a 1985 performance on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and a 1993 appearance on &quot;A Different World&quot;. In the summer of 1980, Horne, 63 years old and intent on retiring from show business, embarked on a two-month series of benefit concerts sponsored by the sorority Delta Sigma Theta. These concerts were represented as Horne&#x27;s farewell tour, yet her retirement lasted less than a year.

On April 13, 1980, Horne, Luciano Pavarotti, and host Gene Kelly were all scheduled to appear at a Gala performance at the Metropolitan Opera House to salute the NY City Center&#x27;s Joffrey Ballet Company. However, Pavarotti&#x27;s plane was diverted over the Atlantic and he was unable to appear. James Nederlander was an invited Honored Guest and observed that only three people at the sold-out Metropolitan Opera House asked for their money back. He asked to be introduced to Horne following her performance. In May 1981, The Nederlander Organization, Michael Frazier, and Fred Walker went on to book Horne for a four-week engagement at the newly named Nederlander Theatre on West 41st Street in New York City. The show was an instant success and was extended to a full year run, garnering Horne a special Tony award, and two Grammy Awards for the cast recording of her show &quot;Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music&quot;. The 333-performance Broadway run closed on Horne&#x27;s 65th birthday, June 30, 1982. Later that same week, she performed the entire show again to record it for television broadcast and home video release. Horne began a tour a few days later at Tanglewood (Massachusetts) during the weekend of July 4, 1982. &quot;The Lady and Her Music&quot; toured 41 cities in the U.S. and Canada until June 17, 1984. It played in London for a month in August and ended its run in Stockholm, Sweden, September 14, 1984. In 1981, she received a Special Tony Award for the show, which also played to acclaim at the Adelphi Theatre in London in 1984. Despite the show&#x27;s considerable success (Horne still holds the record for the longest-running solo performance in Broadway history), she did not capitalize on the renewed interest in her career by undertaking many new musical projects. A proposed 1983 joint recording project between Horne and Frank Sinatra (to be produced by Quincy Jones) was ultimately abandoned, and her sole studio recording of the decade was 1988&#x27;s &quot;The Men in My Life&quot;, featuring duets with Sammy Davis Jr. and Joe Williams. In 1989, she received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

In 1995, a &quot;live&quot; album capturing Horne&#x27;s Supper Club performance was released (subsequently winning a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album). In 1998, Horne released another studio album, entitled &quot;Being Myself&quot;. Thereafter, Horne retired from performing and largely retreated from public view, though she did return to the recording studio in 2000 to contribute vocal tracks on Simon Rattle&#x27;s &quot;Classic Ellington&quot; album.

== Civil rights activism ==
Horne was long involved with the Civil Rights Movement. In 1941, she sang at Café Society, New York City&#x27;s first integrated venue, and worked with Paul Robeson. During World War II, when entertaining the troops for the USO, she refused to perform &quot;for segregated audiences or for groups in which German POWs were seated in front of Black servicemen&quot;, according to her Kennedy Center biography. Because the U.S. Army refused to allow integrated audiences, she staged her show for a mixed audience of Black U.S. soldiers and white German POWs. Seeing the Black soldiers had been forced to sit in the back seats, she walked off the stage to the first row where the Black troops were seated and performed with the Germans behind her. However, the USO observed at the time of her death that Horne did in fact tour &quot;extensively with the USO during WWII on the West Coast and in the South&quot;. The organization also commemorated her for the appearances she made on Armed Forces Radio Service programs &quot;Jubilee&quot;, &quot;G.I. Journal&quot;, and &quot;Command Performances&quot;. In the film &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; (1943), Horne&#x27;s character would perform the film&#x27;s title song as part of a big, all-star show for World War II soldiers as well. After quitting the USO in 1945, Horne financed tours of military camps herself.

Horne was at an NAACP rally with Medgar Evers in Jackson, Mississippi, the weekend before Evers was assassinated. At the March on Washington she spoke and performed on behalf of the NAACP, S.N.C.C., and the National Council of Negro Women. She also worked with Eleanor Roosevelt in attempts to pass anti-lynching laws. Tom Lehrer mentions her in his song &quot;National Brotherhood Week&quot; in the line &quot;Lena Horne and Sheriff Clark are dancing cheek to cheek&quot; referring (wryly) to her and to Sheriff Jim Clark, of Selma, Alabama, who was responsible for a violent attack on civil rights marchers in 1965. In 1983, the NAACP awarded her the Spingarn Medal.

Horne was a registered Democrat and on November 20, 1963, she, along with Democratic National Committee (D.N.C.) Chairman John Bailey, Carol Lawrence, Richard Adler, Sidney Salomon, Vice-chairwoman of the DNC Margaret B. Price, and Secretary of the DNC Dorothy Vredenburgh Bush, visited John F. Kennedy at The White House, two days prior to his assassination.

== Personal life ==
Horne married Louis Jordan Jones, a political operative, in January 1937 in Pittsburgh. On December 21, 1937, their daughter, Gail (1937–2024), was born. They had a son, Edwin Jones (1940–1970), who died of kidney disease. Horne and Jones separated in 1940 and divorced in 1944. Horne&#x27;s second marriage was to Lennie Hayton, who was music director and one of the premier musical conductors and arrangers at MGM, in December 1947 in Paris. They separated in the early 1960s but never divorced. He died in 1971. In her as-told-to autobiography &quot;Lena&quot; by Richard Schickel, Horne recounts the enormous pressures she and her husband faced as an interracial couple. She later admitted in an interview in &quot;Ebony&quot; (May 1980) that she had married Hayton to advance her career and cross the color barrier in show business, but &quot;learned to love him very much&quot;.

Horne had affairs with long-time heavyweight champion Joe Louis, musician and actor Artie Shaw, actor Orson Welles, and director Vincente Minnelli.

Horne also had a long and close relationship with Billy Strayhorn, whom she said she would have married if he had been heterosexual. He was also an important professional mentor to her.

Screenwriter Jenny Lumet, known for her award-winning screenplay &quot;Rachel Getting Married&quot;, is Horne&#x27;s granddaughter, the daughter of filmmaker Sidney Lumet and Horne&#x27;s daughter Gail. Her other grandchildren include Gail&#x27;s other daughter, Amy Lumet, and her son&#x27;s four children, Thomas, William, Samadhi and Lena. Her great-grandchildren include Jake Cannavale.

Horne was Catholic. From 1946 to 1962 she resided in St. Albans, Queens, New York, enclave of prosperous African Americans, where she counted among her neighbors Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald and other jazz luminaries. In the 1980s, she moved into the fifth floor of the Volney, a hotel-turned-co-op, at 23 East 74th Street.

== Death ==
Lena Horne died of congestive heart failure at age 92 on May 9, 2010. Her funeral took place at St. Ignatius Loyola Church on Park Avenue in New York, where she had been a member. Thousands gathered and attendees included: Leontyne Price, Dionne Warwick, Liza Minnelli, Jessye Norman, Chita Rivera, Cicely Tyson, Diahann Carroll, Leslie Uggams, Lauren Bacall, Robert Osborne, Audra McDonald, and Vanessa Williams. Her remains were cremated.

== Legacy ==
In 2003, ABC announced that Janet Jackson would star as Horne in a television biographical film. In the weeks following Jackson&#x27;s &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot; debacle during the 2004 Super Bowl, however, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Horne had demanded Jackson be dropped from the project. &quot;ABC executives resisted Horne&#x27;s demand&quot;, according to the Associated Press report, &quot;but Jackson representatives told the trade newspaper that she left willingly after Horne and her daughter, Gail Lumet Buckley, asked that she not take part.&quot; Oprah Winfrey stated to Alicia Keys during a 2005 interview on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; that she might possibly consider producing the biopic herself, casting Keys as Horne.

In January 2005, Blue Note Records, her label for more than a decade, announced that &quot;the finishing touches have been put on a collection of rare and unreleased recordings by the legendary Horne made during her time on Blue Note.&quot; Remixed by her long-time producer Rodney Jones, the recordings featured Horne with a remarkably secure voice for a woman of her years, and include versions of such signature songs as &quot;Something to Live For&quot;, &quot;Chelsea Bridge&quot;, and &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;. The album, originally titled &quot;Soul&quot; but renamed &quot;Seasons of a Life&quot;, was released on January 24, 2006. In 2007, Horne was portrayed by Leslie Uggams as the older Lena and Nikki Crawford as the younger Lena in the stage musical &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; staged at the Pasadena Playhouse in California (January to March 2009). In 2011, Horne was also portrayed by actress Ryan Jillian in a one-woman show titled &quot;Notes from A Horne&quot; staged at the Susan Batson studio in New York City, from November 2011 to February 2012. The 83rd Academy Awards presented a tribute to Horne by actress Halle Berry at the ceremony held February 27, 2011.

In 2018, a forever stamp depicting Horne began to be issued; this made Horne the 41st honoree in the Black Heritage stamp series.

In June 2021, the Prospect Park bandshell in Brooklyn was renamed the Lena Horne Bandshell to honor Horne, a Bed-Stuy Brooklyn native, and to show solidarity with the Black community.

The Nederlander Organization announced in June 2022 that Broadway&#x27;s Brooks Atkinson Theatre would be renamed after her later that year. The theater&#x27;s marquee was unveiled on November 1, 2022. The theatre is now called the Lena Horne Theatre, which means Horne is the first Black woman to have a Broadway theater named after her.

<doc id="263996" wikidata="Q278475" url="?curid=263996" title="Axeman of New Orleans">
<text>The Axeman of New Orleans was an unidentified American serial killer who was active in and around New Orleans, Louisiana, between May 1918 and October 1919. Press reports during the height of public panic over the killings mentioned similar crimes as early as 1911, but recent researchers have called these reports into question. The attacker was never identified, and the murders remain unsolved.

==Background==
As the killer&#x27;s epithet implies, the victims usually were attacked with an axe, which often belonged to the victims themselves. In most cases, a panel on the backdoor of a home was removed by a chisel, which, along with the panel, was left on the floor near the door. The intruder then attacked one or more of the inhabitants with either an axe or a straight razor. The crimes were not motivated by robbery, and the perpetrator never removed items from his victims&#x27; homes.

The majority of the Axeman&#x27;s victims were Italian immigrants or Italian-Americans, leading many to believe that the crimes were ethnically motivated. Many media outlets sensationalized this aspect of the crimes, even suggesting Mafia involvement despite lack of evidence. Some crime analysts have suggested that the killings were sexually motivated, and that the murderer was perhaps a sexual sadist specifically seeking female victims. Criminologists Colin and Damon Wilson hypothesize that the Axeman killed male victims only when they obstructed his attempts to murder women, supported by cases in which the woman of the household was murdered but not the man. 

A less plausible theory is that the Axeman committed the murders in an attempt to promote jazz music, suggested by written correspondence attributed to the killer in which he stated that he would spare the lives of those who played jazz in their homes. On March 13, 1919, a letter purporting to be from the Axeman was published in newspapers, saying that he would kill again at fifteen minutes past midnight on the night of March 19 but would spare the occupants of any place where a jazz band was playing. That night all of the city&#x27;s dance halls were filled to capacity, and professional and amateur bands played jazz at parties at hundreds of houses around town. There were no murders that night.

The Axeman was never caught or identified, and his crime spree stopped as mysteriously as it had started. The murderer&#x27;s identity remains unknown, although various possible identifications of varying plausibility have been proposed.

==Suspects==

Crime writer Colin Wilson speculates the Axeman could have been Joseph Monfre, a man shot to death in Los Angeles in December 1920 by the widow of Mike Pepitone, the Axeman&#x27;s last known victim. Wilson&#x27;s theory has been widely repeated in other true crime books and websites. However, true crime writer Michael Newton searched public, police and court records in New Orleans and Los Angeles, as well as newspaper archives, and failed to find any evidence of a man named &quot;Joseph Monfre&quot; (or a similar name) having been assaulted or killed in Los Angeles.

Newton was also not able to find any information that Mrs. Pepitone (identified in some sources as Esther Albano, and in others simply as a &quot;woman who claimed to be Pepitone&#x27;s widow&quot;) was arrested, tried or convicted for such a crime, or indeed had been in California. Newton notes that &quot;Momfre&quot; was not an unusual surname in New Orleans at the time of the crimes. It appears that there actually may have been an individual named Joseph Momfre or Mumfre in New Orleans who had a criminal history, and who may have been connected with organized crime; however, local records for the period are not extensive enough to allow confirmation of this, or to positively identify the individual. Wilson&#x27;s explanation is an urban legend, and there is no more evidence now on the identity of the killer than there was at the time of the crimes.

Two of the alleged &quot;early&quot; victims of the Axeman, an Italian couple named Schiambra, were shot by an intruder in their Lower Ninth Ward home during the early morning hours of May 16, 1912. The male Schiambra survived while his wife did not. In newspaper accounts, the prime suspect was referred to by the name of &quot;Momfre&quot; more than once. While radically different than the Axeman&#x27;s usual &quot;modus operandi&quot;, if Joseph Momfre was indeed the Axeman, the Schiambras may well have been early victims of the future serial killer.

According to scholar Richard Warner, the chief suspect in the crimes was Frank &quot;Doc&quot; Mumphrey (1875–1921), who used the alias Leon Joseph Monfre/Manfre. Mumphrey&#x27;s Garden District jazz business, previously struggling, was noted by many in the community as seeming to do unusually good business once the city was compelled by threat of violence to hire jazz bands and play jazz records.

==Canonical victims==
===Joseph and Catherine Maggio===
On May 23, 1918, Joseph Maggio, an Italian grocer, and his wife Catherine were attacked while sleeping inside their apartment on the corner of Upperline and Magnolia Streets. The killer broke into the residence and cut the couple&#x27;s throats with a straight razor; Catherine&#x27;s throat was cut so deeply that her head was nearly severed from her shoulders. The killer then struck both victims with an axe, perhaps in order to conceal the cause of death. Joseph survived the attack, but died minutes after being discovered by his brothers, Jake and Andrew. The killer wrote a message on the nearby pavement reading, &quot;Mrs. Maggio will sit up tonight just like Mrs. Toney&quot;, theorized to be a reference to Anthony and Joanna Sciambra, Italian greengrocers who were attacked (Johanna fatally) in 1911.

Police found the bloody clothes of the murderer in the apartment, as he had obviously changed into a clean set of clothes before fleeing the scene. A complete search of the premises was not performed after the bodies were removed, yet the bloodstained razor was later found on the lawn of a neighboring property. Police ruled out robbery as motivation for the attacks, as money and valuables left in plain sight were not stolen by the intruder. The razor was found to belong to Joseph&#x27;s brother Andrew, who owned a barber shop on Camp Street. His employee, Esteban Torres, told police that Andrew had removed the razor from his shop two days prior to the murder, explaining that he had wanted to have a nick honed from the blade. Andrew, who lived in an adjoining apartment, reported hearing groaning noises through the wall on the night of the murders. Andrew blamed his failure to hear any noise related to the attack itself on his intoxicated state; police, however, were nonetheless surprised that he failed to hear the intruder&#x27;s forced entry into the home. 

Andrew became the police chief&#x27;s prime suspect in the crime, yet was released after investigators were unable to break down his statement, as well as his account of an unknown man who was supposedly seen lurking near the apartment prior to the murders.

===Louis Besumer and Harriet Lowe===
During the early morning hours of June 27, 1918, Louis Besumer and his mistress Harriet Lowe were attacked in private quarters at the back of Besumer&#x27;s grocery, located at the corner of Dorgenois and Laharpe Streets. Besumer was struck with a hatchet above his right temple, which resulted in a possible skull fracture. Lowe was hacked over the left ear and left with one side of her face permanently paralyzed. The couple were discovered the following morning, alive but critically injured, by bakery wagon driver John Zanca, who had come to the grocery to make a routine delivery. The axe, which had belonged to Besumer himself, was found in an adjacent bathroom. 

Besumer stated to investigators that he had been sleeping when he was attacked with the hatchet. Almost immediately, police arrested Lewis Oubicon, a 41-year-old African American man who had been employed in the grocery just a week before the attacks. No evidence existed which could have proved Oubicon guilty, yet police arrested him nonetheless, stating that he had offered conflicting accounts of his whereabouts on the morning of the attack. Oubicon was later released, however, as police were unable to gather sufficient evidence to hold him. Lowe recalled her assailant having been a mulatto man, yet her statement was discounted by police due to her disoriented state. Robbery was said to be the only possible explanation for the attacks, yet no money or valuables were removed from the scene.

Lowe became the center of a media circus as she continually made scandalous and often false statements relating to both the attacks and the character of Besumer. After Besumer fell under suspicion of espionage following the discovery of foreign-written letters in his possession, Lowe told police that she thought he was a German spy, resulting in his immediate arrest; he was released two days later. In August 1918, Besumer was arrested again after Lowe, by then on her deathbed following failed surgery, named him as her assailant. Besumer was charged with murder, and served nine months in prison, before being acquitted on May 1, 1919, after a ten-minute jury deliberation.

===Anna Schneider===
During the early morning hours of August 5, 1918, 28-year-old Anna Schneider, who was eight months pregnant, awoke to find a dark figure standing over her and was bashed in the face repeatedly; her scalp was cut open, and her face was covered in blood. Anna was discovered after midnight by her husband, Ed Schneider, as he returned late from work. Anna claimed that she remembered nothing of the attack and gave birth to a healthy baby girl two days later. Ed told police that nothing was stolen from the home besides six or seven dollars that had been in his wallet. The windows and doors of the couple&#x27;s apartment appeared to have not been forced open, and authorities came to the conclusion that the woman was most likely attacked with a lamp that had been on a nearby table. 

James Gleason, who police said was an ex-convict, was arrested shortly after Anna was found. He was later released due to lack of evidence. Lead investigators began to publicly speculate that the attack was related to the previous Besumer and Maggio incidents.

===Joseph Romano===
On August 10, 1918, Pauline and Mary Bruno awoke to the sound of a commotion in the adjoining room where their elderly uncle, Joseph Romano, resided. Upon entering the room, the sisters discovered Romano had taken a serious blow to his head, which resulted in two open cuts. The assailant was fleeing the scene as they arrived, yet the girls were able to distinguish that he was a dark-skinned, heavy-set man who wore a dark suit and slouched hat. Romano was able to walk to the ambulance once it arrived yet died two days later due to severe head trauma. His home had been ransacked, yet no items were stolen. Authorities found a bloody axe in the backyard and discovered that a panel on the backdoor had been chiseled away. 

The murder created a state of extreme chaos in New Orleans, with residents living in constant fear of an Axeman attack. Police received a slew of reports in which citizens claimed to have seen the killer lurking in local neighborhoods. A few men even called to report that they had found axes in their backyards. John Dantonio, a then-retired Italian detective, made public statements in which he hypothesized that the man who had committed the recent murders was the same who had killed several individuals in 1911. Dantonio described the potential killer as an individual of dual personalities, who killed without motive. This type of individual, Dantonio stated, could very likely have been a normal, law-abiding citizen, who was often overcome by an overwhelming desire to kill. He later went on to describe the killer as a real-life &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;.

===Cortimiglia family===
On the night of March 10, 1919, Italian immigrant Charles Cortimiglia and his family wife Rosie and infant daughter Mary were attacked in their residence on the corner of Jefferson Avenue and Second Street in Gretna, Louisiana, a New Orleans suburb. Upon hearing screams from the Cortimiglia residence, grocer Iorlando Jordano rushed across the street to investigate. He discovered that Cortimiglia&#x27;s family had all been attacked by the Axeman. Charles and Rosie had both suffered skull fractures from blows caused by an axe, which was found on their back porch; Mary was killed in her mother&#x27;s arms from a blow to the back of the neck. Nothing was stolen from the house, but a panel on the backdoor had been chiseled away. Charles was released two days after the attack while his wife remained in the care of doctors. 

Upon gaining full consciousness, Rosie made claims that Jordano and his 18-year-old son, Frank, were responsible for the attacks. Iorlando, a 69-year-old man, was in too poor of health to have done so. Frank, more than six feet tall and weighing over 200 pounds, would have been too large to have fit through the panel on the backdoor. Charles vehemently denied his wife&#x27;s claims, yet police nonetheless arrested the Jordanos and charged them with the murder. The men would later be found guilty. Frank was sentenced to hang, and his father to life in prison. Charles divorced his wife after the trial. Almost a year later, Rosie admitted that she had falsely accused the Jordanos out of jealousy and spite, resulting in their release.

===Steve Boca===
On August 10, 1919, grocer Steve Boca was attacked as he slept in his bedroom by an axe-wielding intruder. Boca awoke during the night to find a dark figure looming over his bed. Upon regaining consciousness, Boca ran to the street to investigate the intrusion, and found that his head had been cracked open. The grocer ran to the home of his neighbor, Frank Genusa, where he lost consciousness and collapsed. Nothing had been taken from the home yet, once again, a panel on the backdoor of the home had been chiseled away. Boca recovered from his injuries but could not remember any details of the attack. This attack took place after the emergence of the infamous Axeman letter.

===Sarah Laumann===
On the night of September 3, 1919, Sarah Laumann was attacked in her apartment. Neighbors came to check on the young woman, who had lived alone, and broke into the home when Laumann did not answer. They discovered the 19-year-old lying unconscious on her bed, suffering from a severe head injury and missing several teeth. The intruder had entered the apartment through an open window and attacked Laumann with a blunt object. A bloody axe was discovered on the front lawn of the building. Laumann recovered from her injuries yet couldn&#x27;t recall any details from the attack.

===Mike Pepitone===
On the night of October 27, 1919, the wife of Mike Pepitone was awakened by a noise and arrived at the door of her husband&#x27;s bedroom just as a large, axe-wielding man was fleeing the scene. Pepitone had been struck in the head and was covered in his own blood. Blood spatter covered the majority of the room, including a painting of the Virgin Mary. Pepitone&#x27;s wife, the mother of six children, was unable to describe any characteristics of the killer other than &quot;large&quot;. The Pepitone murder was the last of the alleged Axeman attacks.

<text>You can&#x27;t have your cake and eat it (too) is a popular English idiomatic proverb or figure of speech. The proverb literally means &quot;you cannot simultaneously retain possession of a cake and eat it, too&quot;. Once the cake is eaten, it is gone. It can be used to say that one cannot have two incompatible things, or that one should not try to have more than is reasonable. The proverb&#x27;s meaning is similar to the phrases &quot;you can&#x27;t have it both ways&quot; and &quot;you can&#x27;t have the best of both worlds.&quot;

For those unfamiliar with it, the proverb may sound confusing due to the ambiguity of the word &#x27;have&#x27;, which can mean &#x27;keep&#x27; or &#x27;to have in one&#x27;s possession&#x27;, but which can also be used as a synonym for &#x27;eat&#x27; (e.g. &#x27;to have breakfast&#x27;). Some find the common form of the proverb to be incorrect or illogical and instead prefer: &quot;You can&#x27;t &quot;eat&quot; your cake and [then still] &quot;have&quot; it (too)&quot;. Indeed, this used to be the most common form of the expression until the 1930s–1940s, when it was overtaken by the have-eat variant. Another, less common, version uses &#x27;keep&#x27; instead of &#x27;have&#x27;.

Choosing between having and eating a cake illustrates the concept of trade-offs or opportunity cost.

==History and usage==
An early recording of the phrase is in a letter on 14 March 1538 from Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, to Thomas Cromwell, as &quot;a man can not have his cake and eat his cake&quot;. The phrase occurs with the clauses reversed in John Heywood&#x27;s &quot;A dialogue Conteinyng the Nomber in Effect of All the Prouerbes in the Englishe Tongue&quot; from 1546, as &quot;wolde you bothe eate your cake, and have your cake?&quot;. In John Davies&#x27;s &quot;Scourge of Folly&quot; of 1611, the same order is used, as &quot;A man cannot eat his cake and haue it stil.&quot;

In Jonathan Swift&#x27;s 1738 farce &quot;Polite Conversation&quot;, the character Lady Answerall says &quot;she cannot eat her cake and have her cake&quot;. In a posthumous adaptation of &quot;Polite Conversation&quot;, called &quot;Tittle Tattle; or, Taste A-la-Mode&quot;, released in 1749, the order was reversed: &quot;And she cannot have her Cake and eat her Cake&quot;. A modern-sounding variant from 1812, &quot;We cannot have our cake and eat it too&quot;, can be found in R. C. Knopf&#x27;s &quot;Document Transcriptions of the War of 1812&quot; (1959).

According to Google Ngram Viewer, a search engine that charts the frequencies of phrases in archived historical (written) documents over time, the eat-have order used to be the most common variant, before being surpassed by the have-eat version in the 1930s and 40s. A reflection of this can be found in Ayn Rand’s 1957 novel Atlas Shrugged. Several pages into John Galt’s famous monologue, he employs the proverb as an analogy in simple terms: “You cannot have your cake and eat it, too”.

In 1996, the eat-have variant played a role in the apprehension of Ted Kaczynski, also known as the Unabomber. In his manifesto, which the terrorist sent to newspapers in the wake of his bombings, Kaczynski advocated the undoing of the industrial revolution, writing: &quot;As for the negative consequences of eliminating industrial society — well, you can’t eat your cake and have it too.&quot; James R. Fitzgerald, an FBI forensic linguist, noted the then-uncommon variant of the proverb and later discovered that Kaczynski had also used it in a letter to his mother. This, among other clues, led to his identification and arrest.

Anarcho-capitalist economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe in his 2001 book, &quot;,&quot; mentions the famous proverb, and then, for further clarification and simplicity states, &quot;You cannot have your cake and eat it too for instance, or what you consume now cannot be consumed again in the future.&quot;

In her 2002 book, classicist Katharina Volk of Columbia University used the phrase to describe the development of poetic imagery in didactic Latin poetry, naming the principle behind the imagery&#x27;s adoption and application the &quot;have-one&#x27;s-cake-and-eat-it-too principle&quot;.

===Cakeism===

The expression “cakeism” and the associated noun and adjective “cakeist” have come into general use in British English, especially in political journalism, and have been accepted into English dictionaries.

The expressions, which reverse the traditional proverb, refer to a wish to enjoy two desirable but incompatible alternatives, especially regarding the UK’s approach to Brexit negotiations and subsequent deliberations. It developed after comments made by the then UK foreign secretary Boris Johnson in 2016, that &quot;I&#x27;ve never been an Outer&quot;. &quot;My policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it.&quot; Subsequently, as prime minister, he described the UK&#x27;s post-Brexit trade deal as a &quot;cakeist treaty&quot;.

The neologisms have since become objects of derision and have led to sarcastic re-reversals.

==Logicality==
The proverb, while commonly used, is at times questioned by people who feel the expression to be illogical or incorrect. As comedian Billy Connolly once put it: &quot;What good is [having] a cake if you can&#x27;t eat it?&quot; According to Paul Brians, Professor of English at Washington State University, the idiom confuses many people because the verb &quot;to have&quot;, can refer to possessing, but also to eating, e.g. &quot;Let&#x27;s have breakfast&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m having a sandwich&quot;. Brians also argues that &quot;You can&#x27;t eat your cake and have it too&quot; is a more logical variant than &quot;You can&#x27;t have your cake and eat it too&quot;, because the verb-order of &quot;eat-have&quot; makes more sense: once you&#x27;ve eaten your cake, you don&#x27;t have it anymore.

Ben Zimmer, writing for the &quot;Language Log&quot; of the University of Pennsylvania, states that the interpretation of the two variants relies on the assumption of either sequentiality or simultaneity. If one believes the phrase to imply sequentiality, then the &quot;eat-have&quot; variant could be seen as a more logical form: you cannot eat your cake and &quot;then&quot; (still) have it, but you actually can have your cake and &quot;then&quot; eat it. Thus, &quot;can&#x27;t eat and (then) have&quot; would be a correct statement, &quot;can&#x27;t have and (then) eat&quot; would be an incorrect statement. However, if one believes the &quot;and&quot; conjoining the verbs to imply simultaneity of action rather than sequentiality of action, then both versions are usable as an idiom, because &quot;cake-eating and cake-having are mutually exclusive activities, regardless of the syntactic ordering&quot;, Zimmer writes.

In response, Richard Mason disagreed with Zimmer&#x27;s assertion on the mutually exclusiveness of the two actions: &quot;simultaneous cake-having and cake-eating are NOT mutually exclusive. On the contrary, generally I cannot eat something at any time when I do not have it. But I eat things when I have them all the time. Only when the object is entirely consumed do I no longer have it (and at that time the eating is also terminated).&quot; Therefore, Mason considers the &quot;have-eat&quot; variant to be &quot;logically indefensible&quot;. Zimmer reacted to Mason by stating: &quot;the &#x27;having&#x27; part of the idiom seems to me to imply possession over a long period of time, rather than the transient cake-having that occurs during cake-eating&quot;. He concludes that it is ultimately not relevant to ponder over the logicality of crystallized, commonly used phrases. &quot;Few people protest the expression to mean &#x27;,&#x27; despite the fact that its &quot;literal&quot; reading describes a normal, non-topsy-turvy bodily alignment&quot;.

Stan Carey, writing for the &quot;Macmillan Dictionary Blog&quot;, likens the &quot;have-eat&quot; vs. &quot;eat-have&quot; question with the discussion over &quot;I could care less&quot; and &quot;I couldn&#x27;t care less&quot;, two phrases that are used to refer to the same thing yet are construed differently, the former sounding illogical because saying &quot;I could care less&quot; would mean that you actually do care to some degree. Carey writes that even though the &quot;eat-have&quot; form of the cake-proverb might make more sense, &quot;idioms do not hinge on logic, and expecting them to make literal sense is futile. But it can be hard to ward off the instinctive wish that language align better with common sense.&quot; Carey jokingly states that the cake-idiom actually does have its cake and eats it.

<text>Hiromi Goto (born December 31, 1966 Chiba-ken, Japan) is a Japanese-Canadian writer, editor, and instructor of creative writing.

==Life==
Goto was born in Chiba&#x27;ken, Japan in 1966 and immigrated to Canada with her family in 1969. They lived on the west coast of British Columbia for eight years before moving to Nanton, Alberta, a small town in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains where her father farmed mushrooms. Goto earned her B.A. in English from the University of Calgary in 1989, where she received creative writing instruction from Aritha Van Herk and Fred Wah.

Goto&#x27;s grandmother told her Japanese stories when she was growing up. Her work is also influenced by her father&#x27;s life stories in Japan. These stories often featured ghosts and folk creatures such as the kappa — a small creature with a frog&#x27;s body, a turtle&#x27;s shell and a bowl-shaped head that holds water. Her writing commonly explores the themes of race, gender and cultural experiences, like eating, while moving between the realms of fantasy, horror and reality.
Her first novel, &quot;Chorus of Mushrooms&quot;, was the 1995 recipient of the Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize Best First Book Canada and Caribbean Region&#x27; and the co-winner of the Canada-Japan Book Award. It has been released in Israel, Italy, Germany, and the United Kingdom. In 2001, she was awarded the James Tiptree, Jr. Award and was short-listed for the regional Commonwealth Writer&#x27;s Prize, Best Book Award, the Sunburst Award and the Spectrum Award.

&quot;Chorus of Mushrooms&quot; is about three generations of Japanese women in Canada, searching for identity in the midst of alienation and an often-hostile host country. The novel explores these characters&#x27; diverse, conflicting perspectives towards assimilation into the majority culture, and through the seamless blending of memory, history, and myth, develops a powerful conversation about what it means to belong. Goto speaks to a diasporic experience, on cultural conflicts held on stages from food to hygiene to language, and to the price paid for denying one&#x27;s origins.

Goto has been the Writer-in-Residence for numerous institutions, including Athabasca University (2012-2013), the University of Alberta (2009-2010), Simon Fraser University (2008), Vancouver Public Library (2007) and Vancouver&#x27;s Emily Carr University of Art and Design. She was the co-Guest of Honor of the 2014 WisCon science fiction convention in Madison, Wisconsin. where she gave a well-received speech on her experiences as a writer. Goto&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Shadow Life&quot; was selected as the Simon Fraser University Library&#x27;s One Book One SFU choice in 2022.

<doc id="264007" wikidata="Q164092" url="?curid=264007" title="Duchy of Saxony">
<text>The Duchy of Saxony () was originally the area settled by the Saxons in the late Early Middle Ages, when they were subdued by Charlemagne during the Saxon Wars from 772 AD and incorporated into the Carolingian Empire (Francia) by 804. Upon the 843 Treaty of Verdun, Saxony was one of the five German stem duchies of East Francia; Duke Henry the Fowler was elected German king in 919.

Upon the deposition of the Welf duke Henry the Lion in 1180, the ducal title fell to the House of Ascania, while numerous territories split from Saxony, such as the Principality of Anhalt in 1218 and the Welf Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg in 1235. In 1296, the remaining lands were divided between the Ascanian dukes of Saxe-Lauenburg and Saxe-Wittenberg, the latter obtaining the title of Electors of Saxony by the Golden Bull of 1356.

==Geography==
The Saxon stem duchy covered the greater part of present-day Northern Germany, including the modern German states () of Lower Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt up to the Elbe and Saale rivers in the east, the city-states of Bremen and Hamburg, the Westphalian part of North Rhine-Westphalia, and the Holstein region (Nordalbingia) of Schleswig-Holstein. In the late 12th century, Duke Henry the Lion also occupied the adjacent area of Mecklenburg (the former Billung March).

The Saxons were one of the most robust groups in the late tribal culture of the times, and eventually bequeathed their tribe&#x27;s name to a variety of more and more modern geopolitical territories, such as Old Saxony (), Upper Saxony, the Electorate, the Prussian Province of Saxony (in present-day Saxony-Anhalt), and the Kingdom of Saxony, the latter corresponding with the German Free State of Saxony, which bears the name today, despite its territory not having been part of the medieval duchy (see map on the right).

==History==

===Older stem duchy===

According to the &quot;Res gestae saxonicae&quot; by tenth century chronicler Widukind of Corvey, the Saxons had arrived from Britannia at the coast of Land Hadeln in the Elbe-Weser Triangle, called by the Merovingian rulers of Francia to support the conquest of Thuringian kingdom, a seeming reversal of the English origin myth where Saxon tribes from the region, under the leadership of legendary brothers Hengist and Horsa, invade post-Roman Britannia (see Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain).

The Royal Frankish Annals mention a 743 Frankish campaign led by the Carolingian Mayor of the Palace Carloman against the Saxons, followed by a second expedition together with his brother Pepin the Short the next year. In 747 their rebellious brother Grifo allied with Saxon tribes and temporarily conquered the stem duchy of Bavaria. Pepin, Frankish king from 750, again invaded Saxony and subdued several Westphalian tribes until 758.

In 772, Pepin&#x27;s son Charlemagne started the final conquest of the Saxon lands. Though his ongoing campaigns were successful, he had to deal with the fragmentation of the Saxon territories in Westphalian, Eastphalian, Angrian, and Nordalbingian tribes, demanding the conclusion of specific peace agreements with single tribes, which soon were to be broken by other clans. The Saxons devastated the Frankish stronghold at Eresburg; their leader (&quot;Herzog&quot;) Widukind refused to appear at the 777 diet at Paderborn, retired to Nordalbingia and afterwards led several uprisings against the occupants, avenged by Charlemagne at the Massacre of Verden in 782. Widukind allegedly had to pledge allegiance in 785, having himself baptised and becoming a Frankish count. Saxon uprisings continued until 804, when the whole stem duchy had been incorporated into the Carolingian Empire.

Afterwards, Saxony was ruled by Carolingian officials, e.g. Wala of Corbie (d. 836), a grandson of Charles Martel and cousin of the emperor, who in 811 fixed the Treaty of Heiligen with King Hemming of Denmark, defining the northern border of the Empire along the Eider River. Among the installed dukes were already nobles of Saxon descent, like Wala&#x27;s successor Count Ekbert, husband of Saint Ida of Herzfeld, a close relative of Charlemagne.

===Younger stem duchy===
Ida of Herzfeld may have been an ancestor of the Saxon count Liudolf (d. 866), who married Oda of Billung and ruled over a large territory along the Leine river in Eastphalia, where he and Bishop Altfrid of Hildesheim founded Gandersheim Abbey in 852. Liudolf became the progenitor of the Saxon ducal, royal and imperial Ottonian dynasty; nevertheless his descendance, especially his affiliation with late Duke Widukind, has not been conclusively established.

Subdued only a few decades earlier, the Saxons rose to one of the leading tribes in East Francia; it is however uncertain if the Ottonians already held the ducal title in the ninth century. Liudolf&#x27;s elder son Bruno (Brun), progenitor of the Brunswick cadet branch of the Brunonen, was killed in a battle with invading Vikings under Godfrid in 880. He was succeeded by his younger brother Otto the Illustrious (d. 912), mentioned as &quot;dux&quot; in the contemporary annals of Hersfeld Abbey, which, however, seems to have been denied by the Frankish rulers. His position was strong enough to wed Hedwiga of the Babenberg, daughter of mighty Duke Henry of Franconia, &quot;princeps militiae&quot; of King Charles the Fat. As all of Hedwiga&#x27;s brothers were killed in the Franconian Babenberg feud with the rivalling Conradines, Otto was able to adopt the strong position of his father-in-law and to evolve the united Saxon duchy under his rule.

In 911, the East Frankish Carolingian dynasty went extinct with the death of King Louis the Child, whereafter the dukes of Saxony, Swabia and Bavaria met at Forchheim to elect the Conradine duke Conrad I of Franconia king. One year later, Otto&#x27;s son Henry the Fowler succeeded his father as Duke of Saxony. According to the medieval chronicler Widukind of Corvey, King Conrad designated Henry his heir, thereby denying the succession of his own brother Eberhard of Franconia, and in 919 the Saxon duke was elected King of East Francia by the assembled Saxon and Franconian princes at Fritzlar. Henry was able to integrate the Swabian, Bavarian and Lotharingian duchies into the imperial federation, vital to handle the continuous attacks by Hungarian forces, whereby the Saxon troops about 928/929 occupied large territories in the east settled by Polabian Slavs. Henry&#x27;s eastern campaigns to Brandenburg and Meissen, the establishment of Saxon marches as well as the surrender of Duke Wenceslaus of Bohemia marked the beginning of the German eastward expansion ().

===House of Billung===
* 936: Upon Henry&#x27;s death at Memleben, his son Otto I succeeded him. According to Widukind, he was crowned king at Aachen Cathedral, with the other German Dukes Gilbert of Lorraine, Eberhard of Franconia, Arnulf of Bavaria and Herman of Swabia paying homage to him. He appoints Hermann Billung as &quot;princeps militiae&quot; or &quot;Markgraf&quot; in the Billung March with orders to subdue the Slavic Lutici beyond the Elbe River.
* 961: Otto I leaves for Italy and his lieutenant margrave Hermann Billung becomes the administrator of Saxony. Before his death he was in all but name the duke of Saxony.
* 973: Hermann Billung dies in Quedlinburg and shortly after Otto I dies in Memleben. Otto II becomes emperor and he make Hermann&#x27;s son Bernhard I the first duke of Saxony of the Billung House.
* 983: Danish uprising in Hedeby. Slavonian uprising in Northalbingia.
* 1011: Duke Bernhard I Billung dies; his son Bernhard II becomes duke.
* 1042: Ordulf Billung, son of Bernhard II, marries Wulfhild, the half-sister of King Magnus of Denmark and Norway. Danes and Saxons fight against the Wends.
* 1059: Ordulf Billung becomes duke after the death of his father.
* 1072: Magnus Billung becomes duke.
* 1106: Duke Magnus dies without heir, ending the Billung dynasty. The Billung territory becomes part of the Welf and Ascanian countries. Lothar of Supplinburg becomes duke of Saxony.
* 1112: Otto of Ballenstedt created duke by Emperor Henry V.
* 1115: Victory of Lothar of Supplinburg in the battle of Welfesholz over King Henry V.
* 1125: Lothar of Supplinburg elected as German king and crowned emperor.
* 1137 Death of Lothar. The Welf Henry the Proud, duke of Bavaria since 1126, had been appointed Lothar&#x27;s successor (who died without a male heir) as duke of Saxony. However, as he was not officially invested and it would make him far too powerful, his claim is not recognized by his rivals. 
* 1138: Henry loses the election for king of the Germans against Conrad of Hohenstaufen. Insisting to hold both duchies, Bavaria and Saxonia, a claim Conrad opposes, Henry refuses an oath of allegiance and is consequently stripped of all his titles. The Duchy of Saxony is granted to the Ascanian Albert the Bear.
* 1139: Due to his marriage to Lothar&#x27;s only daughter Gertrude of Supplingenburg, Henry still holds substantial lands within the Duchy of Saxony. Henry fiercely resists Albert&#x27;s attempts to take possession of Saxony. Preparing an attack on the Duchy of Bavaria, Henry dies unexpectedly.
* 1141: Albert the Bear renounces the Duchy of Saxony and the title (as well as the Duchy of Bavaria) is granted to Henry X&#x27;s adolescent son Henry the Lion.

===Henry the Lion===

In 1142, King Conrad III of Germany granted the ducal title to the Welf scion Henry the Lion (as Duke Henry III). Henry gradually extended his rule over northeastern Germany, leading crusades against the pagan Wends. During his reign, Henry massively supported to the development of the cities in his dominion, such as Brunswick, Lüneburg and Lübeck, a policy ultimately contributing to the movement of the House of Welf from its homelands in southern Germany to the north.

In 1152, Henry supported his cousin Frederick III of Swabia, to be elected King of Germany (as Frederick I Barbarossa), likely under the promise of granting the Duchy of Bavaria back to Henry. Henry&#x27;s dominion now covered more than two thirds of Germany, from the Alps to the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, making him one of the mightiest rulers in central Europe, and thus also a potential threat for other German princes and even Barbarossa.
To expand his rule, Henry continued to claim titles of lesser families, who left no legitimate heir. This policy caused unrest among many Saxon nobles and other German princes, first and foremost his father&#x27;s old enemy, Albrecht the Bear. During Barbarossa&#x27;s fourth Italian campaign in 1166, a league of German Nobles declared war on Henry. The war continued until 1170, despite several attempts of the Emperor to mediate. Ultimately, Henry&#x27;s position remained unchallenged, due to Barbarossa&#x27;s favourable rule.

In 1168, Henry married Matilda Plantagenêt, the daughter of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine and sister of Richard Lionheart.

The following years led to an estrangement between Barbarossa and Henry. Henry ceased to support the Emperor&#x27;s Italy campaigns, which were all proven unsuccessful, as massively as he used to, and instead focused on his own possessions. In 1175 Barbarossa again asked for support against the Lombard League, which Henry is said to have refused bluntly, even though Barbarossa kneeled before him. Records of this event were not written until several years later, and sources are contradictory, depending on whom the author favoured. Nevertheless, lacking the support of the Saxons the following Battle of Legnano was a complete failure for the Emperor.

When the majority of the realm&#x27;s princes had returned from Italy, Henry&#x27;s refusal was instantly exploited to weaken his position. Views differ, whether Barbarossa initiated Henry&#x27;s downfall or if it was orchestrated by the princes first and foremost.

Between 1175 and 1181, Henry was charged with several accusations, such as violating the &quot;honour of the realm&quot; (honor imperii), breach of the peace, and treason. If he were to follow the summons to the Hoftag, Henry would&#x27;ve acknowledge the charges as rightful, and therefore refused all summons. In 1181, he was ultimately stripped of his titles. Unwilling to give up without a fight, Henry already had dealt the first blow in 1180 against the city of Goslar, which he had coveted for several years already. During the following war, Henry&#x27;s domestic policy and the treatment of his vassals proved fatal, and his power quickly crumbled.
In 1182, Henry the Lion ultimately went into exile, joining the court of his father-in-law, Henry II of England. Following the death of his wife and also of the Emperor, the latter while participating in the Third Crusade, Henry returned to Brunswick in 1189 and briefly tried to regain the lost lands. After several setbacks, Henry made peace with Barbarossa&#x27;s son and heir, King Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor.

The ancient stem duchy of Saxony was partitioned in some dozens of territories of imperial immediacy by Barbarossa, and ceased to exist. The western part was split amongst several minor counties and bishoprics, as well as the newly formed Duchy of Westphalia. In the east, the Ascanians, the Welf&#x27;s old rivals, finally gained a severely belittled Duchy of Saxony, occupying only the easternmost, comparably small, territories along the river Elbe around Lauenburg upon Elbe and around Wittenberg upon Elbe. Limiting the lands the Ascanians gained along with the ducal title to these eastern territories caused the migration of the name Saxony from north-western Germany to the location of the modern Free State of Saxony.

The deposed ducal House of Welf could maintain its allodial possessions, which did not remain as part of the Duchy of Saxony after the enfeoffment of the Ascanians. The Welf possessions were elevated to the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg (also Brunswick and Lunenburg) in 1235. This duchy continued to use the old Saxon coat-of-arms showing the Saxon Steed in argent on gules, while the Ascanians adopted for the &quot;younger Duchy of Saxony&quot; their family colours, a barry of ten, in sable and or, covered by a crancelin of rhombs bendwise in vert, symbolising the Saxon dukedom.

===House of Ascania===

In 1269, 1272, and 1282 the co-ruling brothers John I and Albert II gradually divided their governing competences within the then three territorially unconnected Saxon areas (Hadeln, Lauenburg, and Wittenberg), thus preparing a partition.

After John I had resigned in 1282 in favour of his three minor sons Eric I, John II and Albert III, followed by his death three years later, the three brothers and their uncle Albert II continued the joint rule in Saxony.

In 1288, Albert II applied to King Rudolph I for the enfeoffment of his son and heir Duke Rudolph I with the Palatinate of Saxony, which ensued a long-lasting dispute with the eager clan of the House of Wettin. When the County of Brehna was reverted to the Empire after the extinction of its comital family, the king enfeoffed Duke Rudolph. In 1290, Albert II gained the County of Brehna and in 1295 the County of Gommern for Saxony. King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia succeeded in bringing Albert II in favour of electing Adolf of Germany, as new emperor (Albert II signed an elector pact on 29 November 1291 that he would vote the same as Wenceslaus). On April 27, 1292, Albert II, with his nephews still minor, wielded the Saxon electoral vote, electing Adolf of Germany.

The last document mentioning the joint government of Albert II with his nephews as Saxon fellow dukes dates back to 1295. The definite partitioning of the Duchy of Saxony into Saxe-Lauenburg (), jointly ruled by the brothers Albert III, Eric I and John II, and Saxe-Wittenberg (), ruled by Albert II, took place before September 20, 1296. The Vierlande, Sadelbande (Land of Lauenburg), the Land of Ratzeburg, the Land of Darzing (today&#x27;s Amt Neuhaus), and the Land of Hadeln are all mentioned as the separate territory of the brothers. Albert II received Saxe-Wittenberg around the eponymous city and Belzig. Albert II thus became the founder of the Ascanian line of Saxe-Wittenberg.

Members of the Welf cadet branch House of Hanover later became prince-electors of the Hanover (as of 1692/1708), kings of Great Britain, Ireland (both 1714), the United Kingdom (1801), and the Hanover (1814).

==Territories seceded from Saxony after 1180==
A number of seceded territories even gained imperial immediacy, while others only changed their liege lord on the occasion. The following list includes states that existed in the territory of the former stem duchy in addition to the two legal successors of the stem duchy, the Ascanian Duchy of Saxony formed in 1296 centered around Wittenberg and Lauenburg, as well as the Duchy of Westphalia, held by the Archbishops of Cologne, that already split off in 1180.

<text>The Amiidae are a family of basal ray-finned fishes. The bowfin and the eyespot bowfin (&quot;Amia ocellicauda&quot;) are the only two species to survive today, although additional species in all four subfamilies of Amiidae are known from Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Eocene fossils.

Bowfins are now found throughout eastern North America, typically in slow-moving backwaters, canals, and ox-bow lakes. When the oxygen level is low (as often happens in still waters), the bowfin can rise to the surface and gulp air into its swim bladder, which is lined with blood vessels and can serve as a primitive lung.
Amiidae is a monophyletic group that has numerous synapomorphic characters. Amiidae were widespread and particularly rich in species during the Eocene era. During this era, they appeared to be confined almost exclusively to fresh water.

==Taxonomy==
The family is divided into five subfamilies, with 16 genera

<doc id="264011" wikidata="Q106926316" url="?curid=264011" title="Hammersmith nude murders">
<text>The Hammersmith nude murders is the name of a series of six murders in West London, England, in 1964 and 1965. The victims, all prostitutes, were found undressed in or near the River Thames, leading the press to nickname the killer Jack the Stripper (a reference to Jack the Ripper). Two earlier murders, committed in West London in 1959 and 1963, have also been linked by some investigators to the same perpetrator.

Despite &quot;intense media interest and one of the biggest manhunts in Scotland Yard&#x27;s history&quot; the case is unsolved. Forensic evidence gathered at the time is believed to have been destroyed or lost.

== Victims ==
=== Elizabeth Figg ===

Figg was found dead at 5:10am on 17 June 1959 by police officers on routine patrol in Duke&#x27;s Meadows, Chiswick, on the north bank of the River Thames. The park had a reputation as a lovers&#x27; lane, and prostitutes were known to take their clients there.

Figg&#x27;s body was found on scrubland between Dan Mason Drive and the river&#x27;s towpath, approximately west of Barnes Bridge. Her dress was torn at the waist and opened to reveal her breasts; marks around the neck were consistent with strangulation. Figg&#x27;s underwear and shoes were missing, and no identification or personal possessions were found. A pathologist concluded that death had occurred between midnight and 2:00a.m. on 17 June.

A post-mortem photograph of Figg&#x27;s face distributed to the press was independently recognized by her roommate and her mother.

Extensive searches of the areaincluding the river bedfailed to find Figg&#x27;s underwear, black stiletto shoes, or white handbag. A police official theorized that a client had murdered her in his car, after removing her shoes and underwear, and that these and her handbag had then remained in the car after the body was disposed of at Duke&#x27;s Meadows. The proprietor at The Ship public house, on the opposite side of the river to where Figg was found, said that on the night of the murder he and his wife had seen a car&#x27;s headlights as it parked in that area at 12:05a.m. Shortly after the lights were switched off, they heard a woman&#x27;s scream.

=== Gwynneth Rees ===

The body of Welsh-born Gwynneth Rees was found on 8 November 1963 at the Barnes Borough Council household refuse disposal site on Townmead Road, Mortlake. The dump was situated from the Thames towpath, and approximately from Duke&#x27;s Meadows.

Rees was naked except for a single stocking on her right leg, extending no further up than the ankle. She had been accidentally decapitated by a shovel which workmen had been using to level the refuse.

=== Hannah Tailford ===

Tailford was found dead on 2 February 1964 on the Thames foreshore below Linden Housethe clubhouse of the London Corinthian Sailing Clubwest of Hammersmith Bridge. She had been strangled, several of her teeth were missing, and her underwear had been stuffed into her mouth.

=== Irene Lockwood ===

Lockwood was found dead on 8 April 1964 on the foreshore of the Thames at Corney Reach, Chiswick, not far from where Tailford had been found. With the discovery of this victim, police surmised that a serial murderer was at large. Lockwood was pregnant at the time of her death.

=== Helen Barthelemy ===

East Lothian-born Barthelemy was found dead on 24 April 1964 in an alleyway at the rear of 199 Boston Manor Road, Brentford. Barthelemy&#x27;s death gave investigators their first solid piece of evidence in the case: flecks of paint used in car manufacturing. Police felt that the paint had probably come from the killer&#x27;s workplace; they therefore focused on tracing it to a business nearby.

=== Mary Fleming ===

Scottish-born Fleming was found dead on 14 July 1964 outside 48 Berrymede Road, Chiswick. Once again, paint spots were found on the body; many neighbours had also heard a car reversing down the street just before the body was discovered.

=== Frances Brown ===

Brown, a native of Edinburgh, was last seen alive on 23 October 1964 by a colleague who saw her get into a client&#x27;s car; on 25 November her body was found in a car park on Hornton Street, Kensington. She had been strangled. The colleague was able to provide police with an identikit picture and a description of the car, thought to be a grey Ford Zephyr. Brown had testified as a witness for the defence, along with Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies, at the trial of Stephen Ward in July 1963.

=== Bridget O&#x27;Hara ===

Irish immigrant Bridget &quot;Bridie&quot; O&#x27;Hara was found dead on 16 February 1965 near a storage shed behind the Heron Trading Estate, Acton. She had been missing since 11 January. Once again, O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s body turned up flecks of industrial paint which were traced to an electrical transformer near where she was discovered. Her body also showed signs of having been stored in a warm environment. The transformer was a good fit for both the paint and the heating.

== Investigation ==
Chief Superintendent John Du Rose of Scotland Yard, the detective put in charge of the case, interviewed almost 7,000 suspects.

In the spring of 1965, the investigation into the murders encountered a major breakthrough when a sample of paint which perfectly matched that recovered from several victims&#x27; bodies was found beneath a concealed transformer at the rear of a building on the Heron Factory Estate in Acton. This factory estate faced a paint spraying shop. Shortly thereafter, Du Rose held a news conference in which he falsely announced that the police had narrowed the suspect pool down to 20 men and that, by a process of elimination, these suspects were being eliminated from the investigation. After a short time, he announced that the suspect pool contained only 10 members, and then three. There were no further known Stripper killings following the initial news conference.

According to the writer Anthony Summers, Hannah Tailford and Frances Brown, the Stripper&#x27;s third and seventh victims, were peripherally connected to the 1963 Profumo affair. Some victims were also known to engage in the underground party scene in addition to appearing in pornographic movies. Several writers have postulated that the victims may have known each other, and that the killer may have been connected to this scene as well.

== Suspects ==
=== Kenneth Archibald ===
On 27 April 1964, Kenneth Archibald, a 57-year-old caretaker at the Holland Park Lawn Tennis Club, walked into Notting Hill police station and voluntarily confessed to the killing of Irene Lockwood. Archibald was charged with the murder and stood trial at the Old Bailey in June 1964. When asked to plead, he retracted his confession and pleaded not guilty. There was no other evidence to link him to the crime and on 23 June 1964, he was found not guilty by a jury and acquitted by the judge, Mr Justice Neild.

=== Mungo Ireland ===
For Du Rose, the most likely suspect was a Scottish security guard called Mungo Ireland, whom Du Rose first identified in a BBC television interview in 1970 as a respectable married man in his forties whom he codenamed &quot;Big John&quot;. Ireland had apparently been identified as a suspect shortly after Bridget O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s murder, when flecks of industrial paint were traced to the Heron Trading Estate, where he had worked as a security guard.

Shortly after this connection was made, Ireland committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning, leaving a note for his wife that read: &quot;I can&#x27;t stick it any longer&quot;, and finished, &quot;To save you and the police looking for me I&#x27;ll be in the garage&quot;. Whilst seen by many as a strong suspect in the killings, recent research suggests that Ireland was in Scotland when O&#x27;Hara was murdered, and therefore could not have been the Stripper. Crime author Neil Milkins said the killings stopped after Ireland&#x27;s death and the police task force set up to catch the killer was reduced and finally disbanded. Milkins, who wrote the book &quot;Who Was Jack the Stripper?&quot;, was an investigative consultant for the BBC documentary &quot;Dark Son: The Hunt for a Serial Killer&quot;. &quot;On the morning that Ireland’s body was found, he had been due to appear before Acton Magistrates Court to face a charge of failing to stop his car after being involved in a road traffic accident,&quot; said Milkins. &quot;Did Ireland commit suicide to save facing Acton magistrates over a trifling motoring charge or did John Du Rose push him over the edge with his press statements?&quot; The Scotland Yard Serious Crime Review Group re-investigated the Hammersmith murders between 2006 and 2007 and this resulted in a new conclusion. A statement read: &quot;The circumstantial evidence against Mungo Ireland is very strong and it was the view of the officers conducting the most recent review of this case that he was most likely to be responsible.&quot; Although Ireland&#x27;s work records indicated he was in Scotland on the night of O’Hara&#x27;s disappearance, Scotland Yard believe it is possible that these may have been falsified.

=== Freddie Mills ===
In 2001, reformed gangster Jimmy Tippett Jr. claimed that, during research for his book about London&#x27;s gangland, he had uncovered information suggesting that British light heavyweight boxing champion Freddie Mills was responsible for the murders. According to Tippett, Kray-era gangsters, including Charlie Richardson and Frankie Fraser, had long suspected Mills of being the murderer.

Mills had previously been linked with the murders by Peter Neale, a freelance journalist from Balham, south London, who told police in July 1972 that he had received information, in confidence, from a serving chief inspector that Mills &quot;killed the nude prostitutes&quot;. He also said that this was &quot;common knowledge in the West End. Many people would say, &#x27;Oh, Freddie did them in...&#x27;&quot;

Mills was found shot dead in his car, apparently by suicide, in July 1965.

The suggestion that Mills was the Hammersmith nudes murderer originated with gangster Frankie Fraser, who told it to policeman Bob Berry, who told &quot;The Sun&quot; crime reporter Michael Litchfield. Fraser claimed that the story was confessed by Mills, to Scotland Yard Chief Superintendent John Du Rose, and told by Du Rose to him; but when Du Rose published his autobiography which touched on the &#x27;Hammersmith Nude Murders&#x27;, there was no mention of Freddie Mills with regard to this case. The claims have since been dismissed. Peter McInnes put the allegations to the investigating officer, who stated that Mills had never been a suspect during the investigation.

=== Metropolitan Police officer ===
David Seabrook, in his book &quot;Jack of Jumps&quot; (2006), wrote that a former Metropolitan Police detective was a suspect in the opinion of several senior detectives investigating the case. Owen Summers, a journalist for &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper, had previously raised suspicion about the unnamed officer&#x27;s involvement in a series of articles published by the newspaper in 1972, and &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; journalist Brian McConnell followed a similar line of inquiry in his book &quot;Found Naked and Dead&quot; in 1974. He was also considered by Dick Kirby, a former Metropolitan Police detective, in his book &quot;Laid Bare: The Nude Murders and the Hunt for &#x27;Jack the Stripper&quot;&#x27; (2016), in which Kirby referred to him only as &quot;the Cop&quot;.

=== Tommy Butler ===
In their book &quot;The Survivor&quot; (2002), Jimmy Evans and Martin Short allege the culprit was Superintendent Tommy Butler of the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s Flying Squad. Butler died in 1970.

=== Harold Jones ===

The Crime &amp; Investigation channel&#x27;s &quot;Fred Dinenage: Murder Casebook&quot; put forward the theory in 2011 that the killer could have been Harold Jones, a convicted murderer from Wales. Jones killed two girls in 1921 in his home town of Abertillery. Because he was 15 at the time, he was not liable for the death penalty and instead received a life sentence. He was released from Wandsworth prison in 1941, at the age of 35, for exemplary behaviour. He is believed to have then returned to Abertillery, and visited the graves of his victims. By 1947, Jones was living in Fulham, London. All the Stripper murders had similar features to his early murders, with no sexual assault, but extreme violence inflicted on the victims. Due to poor record-keeping, he was never considered as a possible suspect by the police. Jones died in Hammersmith in 1971.

The Welsh writer Neil Milkins, in &quot;Who Was Jack the Stripper?&quot; (2011), also concluded that Jones was the perpetrator. While researching Jones for his book &quot;Every Mother&#x27;s Nightmare&quot;, Milkins had traced the murderer&#x27;s movements: &quot;[H]e turned up in Fulham in the late 1940s calling himself Harry Stevens, and stayed at that address in Hestercombe Avenue until 1962, at which point he disappeared again. I came across the Jack the Stripper case on the internet and realised that in the same three years Jones&#x27; whereabouts remained unknown – 1962 to 1965 – a number of prostitutes had been murdered in the same west London area.&quot;

In January 2019 the possible involvement of Jones was re-examined in the 90-minute documentary &quot;Dark Son: The Hunt for a Serial Killer&quot; broadcast on BBC Two. Criminologist Professor David Wilson and an investigative team, including former detective Jackie Malton and forensic psychologist Professor Mike Berry, use contemporary policing techniques such as geographic profiling and offender profiling to see if the crimes of Jones the boy can be measured against those of the London killer. There are many similarities.

== In the media ==
The murders have been the subject of several television documentaries:
* &quot;Great Crimes and Trials&quot; documentary series – &quot;The Hammersmith Murders&quot; episode, first broadcast in the UK by BBC in 1993.
* &quot;Fred Dinenage: Murder Casebook&quot; documentary series – &quot;Murders That Shocked a Nation: The Welsh Child Killer&quot;, first broadcast in the UK by CI in 2011.
* &quot;Dark Son: The Hunt for a Serial Killer&quot; (2018) – BBC documentary. This was filmed in both London and Abertillery, and contributors include criminologist David Wilson and writer Robin Jarossi, author of &quot;The Hunt for the &#x27;60s Ripper&quot;.
* Fairies Wear Boots - Black Sabbath song from the album Paranoid (album), titled &quot;Jack the Stripper/Fairies Wear Boots&quot; on the original 1970 US release.

== In fiction ==
The crime novel &quot;Goodbye Piccadilly, Farewell Leicester Square&quot; (1969), written by Arthur La Bern, is loosely based on the case. The book was adapted for the Alfred Hitchcock movie &quot;Frenzy&quot; (1972). The case also inspired &quot;The Fiend&quot; (1972), in which a misogynistic serial killer leaves his naked victims across London.

The crime novel &quot;Bad Penny Blues&quot; (2009) by Cathi Unsworth is closely based on the case.

<text>Washington Adventist University is a private Seventh-day Adventist university in Takoma Park, Maryland.

== History ==
Washington Adventist University was established in 1904 by the Seventh-day Adventist Church as Washington Training College. In 1907, it was renamed Washington Foreign Mission Seminary, in 1914, Washington Missionary College, in 1961, Columbia Union College, and in 2009 received its current name.

In 2007, WAU nearly accepted a $25 million bid for the radio station owned by WAU, WGTS 91.9FM, from American Public Media Group. WGTS listeners and supporters ran multiple campaigns against the sale for months before the board of trustees voted against selling the radio station in September 2007. WAU would have used the sale payment to pay down about $5 million in debts and to increase its endowment of $4 million. The school, which has an enrollment of about 1,000 students, also anticipated that the proceeds would pay for constructing the first new building on campus in 37 years.

In 2008, President Weymouth Spence announced he would eliminate or freeze up to 22 faculty and staff positions in order to restructure the school&#x27;s curriculum and relieve WAU&#x27;s multimillion-dollar debt. The announcement came as part of Spence&#x27;s plan to restructure WAU into a health science-focused institution. As a result, some students and faculty expressed uncertainty and displeasure to local and school-wide media regarding the change in school focus.

== Academics ==

WAU is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education and approved by the Adventist Accrediting Association of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists and the Maryland Higher Education Commission. Professional accreditations include the Department of Baccalaureate and Higher Degree Programs of the National League for Nursing, the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs, and the Maryland State Department of Education.

The university offers undergraduate Associate and bachelor&#x27;s degrees, as well as several certificate programs. Graduate programs include the following: MBA, Masters of Nursing with Business Leadership, Masters in Public Administration, Masters of Religion, and Masters in Psychology. Adult evening courses towards accelerated bachelor&#x27;s degree programs are also available from the School of Graduate and Professional Services.

The current president of the college is Weymouth Spence, who has announced plans for structural changes to attempt to revitalize the school. The changes are described in detail in a document called &quot;The Plan&quot;. President Spence succeeded Randal Wisbey, who left in 2007 for La Sierra University. The resident agent is The Corporation Trust, Inc., in Baltimore, MD.

== Student life ==

The student body is diverse with students attending from a reported 40 states and 47 countries.

WAU has 16 separate student clubs/organizations, including 6 honor societies. WAU is recognized with a premier music department and award-winning music ensembles. The New England Youth Ensemble (NEYE), WAU&#x27;s resident orchestra, is one of North America&#x27;s most traveled orchestras. Under the direction of faculty member Preston Hawes, the Carnegie Scholars Program of the NEYE affords qualified students a mentoring relationship with professional musicians of its parent organization, the New England Symphonic Ensemble, the resident orchestra of MidAmerica Productions in New York City. The Music Department features two choral groups, the Columbia Collegiate Chorale, and the elite performing vocal ensemble ProMusic. The Washington Concert Winds holds a yearly band festival where a newly commissioned work, composed specifically for the occasion is premiered each spring semester. The Music Department is housed in a newly constructed building, the Lois and Leroy Peters Music Center.

Other groups include the following:

*BSU Gospel Choir
*Mock trial team
*Newspaper/college journal
*Ethnic groups
*Political groups
*Social service groups
*Student Association

WAU also features a Sports-Acrobatics Exhibition Team. The Acro-Airs have performed across the country and for a variety of venues. The team does performances at schools and community events where they spread the message of healthy living including abstaining from drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. Washington Adventist University&#x27;s Acro-Airs also perform half-time shows for NBA games. They have performed at games for the Washington Wizards, Indiana Pacers, New York Knicks, and others. A recent performance was at the &quot;Discover Strathmore Open House 2009&quot;, which was sponsored in part by the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Baily Circus.

The &quot;Columbia Journal&quot; serves as the campus newspaper.

Many of the student body are members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, though students of all faiths and belief systems may enroll. Weekly church services are held at the campus church, Sligo Church.

== Athletics ==
The Washington Adventist athletic teams are called the Shock. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing as an NAIA Independent within the Continental Athletic Conference since the 2014–15 academic year. They also compete as a member of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA) since the 2013–14 academic year. The Shock previously competed in the NCAA Division II ranks as an NCAA D-II Independent, which they withdrew from at the end of the 2012–13 school year.

Washington Adventist compete in nine intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country and soccer; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, softball, soccer and volleyball. The university also houses a showcase acrobatics team known as the Acro-Airs.

=== Intramurals ===
In addition to intercollegiate athletics, WAU offers intramural sports for men and women. Sports facilities and activities are available to students. A volleyball club, fitness club, sports fields, and weight room complement the program.

=== Accomplishments ===
The 2008 men&#x27;s baseball team won the USCAA National Championship, the first national championship in the school&#x27;s history. The &quot;Iron Nine&quot; of the Washington Adventist University baseball team played in three national championship games between 2006 and 2009. Along with winning the title in 2008 they have been national runners-up in 2006 and 2009.

=== Withdrawals ===
In recent years, WAU eliminated their men&#x27;s volleyball program, along with the baseball, softball, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track and field program.

==Study abroad opportunities==
Washington Adventist University co-sponsors Adventist Colleges Abroad, a program in which qualified students study overseas while completing requirements for graduation at Washington Adventist University. This language and cultural immersion is available in eight locations: Argentina, Austria, Brazil, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, and Spain, WAU undergraduate students may also study business courses in England through an exclusive partnership program with Newbold College just outside London, England.

<doc id="264015" wikidata="Q2297886" url="?curid=264015" title="Electro (Marvel Comics)">
<text>Electro () is the name of two supervillains appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

Created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, the Maxwell &quot;Max&quot; Dillon version of Electro was introduced in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #9 (Feb. 1964) as an adversary to the superhero Spider-Man. Electro has since endured as one of the web-slinger&#x27;s most prominent foes, though he has also come into conflict with other heroes, most notably Daredevil. He is a founding member of the Sinister Six, and the leader of the original incarnation of the Emissaries of Evil, the first supervillain teams to oppose Spider-Man and Daredevil, respectively. In the original version of the story, Max Dillon was a lineman for an electric company who turned to a life of crime after being struck by lightning while working on a power line. He consequently became a living electric capacitor. Electro&#x27;s superpowers revolve around controlling electricity, which he can absorb to &quot;charge&quot; himself and become more powerful, gaining additional abilities such as flight and enhanced physical attributes. Since his conception, the character has undergone several design changes, from his original green and yellow costume, to his modern look with blue skin and a bald head.

During the time that Max Dillon was dead between 2016 and 2021, a second Electro named Francine Frye was introduced.

Outside of comics, both Dillon and Frye have been featured in various media adaptations of &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, including feature films, television series, and video games. In particular, Jamie Foxx portrayed Dillon in the live-action films &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot; (2014) and &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021).

==Publication history==
The Max Dillon incarnation of Electro was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, and first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #9 (Feb. 1964). The character is also known as the member of the Frightful Four battling the Fantastic Four. He is also the first major Marvel villain to be written in publication history as battling Daredevil, even being the founder and leader of the supervillain team that oppose him, the Emissaries of Evil.

The second incarnation of Electro, Francine Frye, was created by Dan Slott and Humberto Ramos, and first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; vol. 3 #2 (July 2014), though she did not become Electro until &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; vol. 4 #17 (October 2016).

==Fictional character biography==
===Maxwell Dillon===

While Maxwell &quot;Max&quot; Dillon, an electrical engineer and lineman, is repairing a power line, a freak lightning accident causes a mutagenic change that transforms him into a living electrical capacitor. His powers are initially weak, so he spends some time stealing electrical equipment from Stark Industries to charge himself. During this time, he is approached by Magneto, who considers him a potential recruit for his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, claiming that Dillon&#x27;s power rival his own, but Dillon refuses. The following day, Dillon is confronted by a small-time thug from whom he was borrowing money to pay for the machinery he needed. When the thug draws a gun on him because he did not pay back the money yet, he responds by shooting a blast of lightning through the thug&#x27;s chest—the first time Dillon ever kills anybody.

Soon taking the name &quot;Electro&quot;, he turns to a life of a professional crime, his first victim being J. Jonah Jameson. Electro breaks into the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; Building and steals from Jameson&#x27;s safe right in front of him. Jameson accuses Spider-Man of being an alternate identity of Electro, prompting Spider-Man to prove the publisher wrong. During their first ever confrontation, Spider-Man is nearly killed after touching the electrically charged villain. Spider-Man eventually uses a fire hose to short-circuit Electro while wearing rubber gloves to protect himself.

Electro next confronts Daredevil for the first time when trying to break into the Baxter Building. He is again defeated. Electro later joins the original Sinister Six led by Doctor Octopus, and is the first member of the group to fight Spider-Man, battling him at a Stark plant. Spider-Man enters the fight believing he lost his powers, however after dodging a bolt of electricity from Electro he realizes his powers returned. Electro loses his power when the power is cut off by Spider-Man, who gets a card from him that leads him to fight Kraven the Hunter. Electro attacks the Fantastic Four at the wedding of Sue Storm and Reed Richards, under the influence of Doctor Doom&#x27;s mind-control machine, but he has no memory of this due to the actions of Mister Fantastic. He later recruits the Emissaries of Evil in a plot of revenge against Daredevil for previous defeats. This group consists of Gladiator, Stilt-Man, Leap-Frog, and the Matador.

Electro is later hired by J. Jonah Jameson to defeat Spider-Man on national television. He encounters Daredevil again in San Francisco, at which time he temporarily dons a modified costume. He then takes control of a Protarian android seeking the destruction of Omega. Electro then teams with Blizzard against Spider-Man and Daredevil. Electro then attempts to aid a band of criminals escaping the Defenders. Electro later joins the Frightful Four. As part of the Frightful Four, he uses Spider-Man as bait to trap the Fantastic Four. Subsequently, he battles the Falcon but is defeated, partly because he does not consider the Falcon to be a serious threat. Electro later learns that he can electro-statically disrupt Spider-Man&#x27;s wall-crawling ability. Chameleon and Hammerhead then send the Shocker to try to recruit Electro into their organization. Instead, he later accepts Doctor Octopus&#x27; invitation to rejoin the Sinister Six, and battles Spider-Man.

Electro fights Spider-Man countless times, either on his own or as part of a group such as the Sinister Six. He also fights such other heroes as Daredevil, the Fantastic Four, and the New Avengers. Despite his immense power, he almost always is defeated, usually as a result of his foes outsmarting him or taking advantage of his weakness to water while charged. As a result of his frequent and often embarrassing defeats, Electro tries to take over New York City&#x27;s power supply in an attempt at glory and respect. Spider-Man thwarts this plan, however, and convinces Electro to quit his criminal career. When Kaine (Spider-Man&#x27;s insane clone) starts killing enemies of Spider-Man, Electro begins to fear for his life and temporarily joins Hobgoblin&#x27;s(Jason Macendale) Sinister Seven, which were formed to combat Kaine. This group is quickly disbanded, and following Kaine&#x27;s subsequent disappearance, Electro returns to retirement.

This changes when the Rose agrees to fund an experimental technique that can amplify Electro&#x27;s abilities, in exchange for Electro&#x27;s services as an enforcer. Seeing this as a chance to rise above the string of failures that made up so much of his life, Electro undergoes the procedure. After paying off his debt to the Rose by defeating several members of The True Believers (an offshoot of the ninja sect called the Hand), a group of ninja assassins who was interfering in the Rose&#x27;s operations, Electro attempts to demonstrate his newly amplified powers to the world, once again attempting to take control of New York City&#x27;s power supply. Wearing an insulated suit, Spider-Man stops him. Electro, in an effort to make a final grand gesture, throws himself into the Hudson River while his body is highly charged, seemingly killing himself in an explosion.

Somehow surviving, Electro resurfaces later as part of the re-formed Sinister Six, formed to kill Senator Stewart Ward and Doctor Octopus (whom the other members of the Six hate due to his arrogance). His powers seemingly reverted to their pre-amplification level, and he wears a new blue-and-white costume. When Venom betrays his fellow Sinister Six members, attempting to kill them one by one, he attacks Electro and leaves him for dead. Once again, Electro survives, and returns to his yellow-and green-costume. Electro is working with the Vulture when they are attacked by Spider-Man, who thinks they kidnapped his Aunt May. Electro manages to bring Spider-Man to the edge of defeat, using his powers in more intelligent ways and blowing up a large number of cars, including some with children in them. After a devastating battle, Spider-Man defeats him by fighting him to a gas refinery. The badly wounded Electro recovers and shortly afterwards joins the Sinister Twelve, assembled by the Green Goblin, though he and the rest of the team is defeated thanks to the intervention of the Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Captain America, Iron Man and Yellowjacket.
Later, separately, he is hired by the Skrull Pagon (posing as Elektra) to free Karl Lykos (also known as Sauron) from The Raft, a maximum-security prison for supervillains. After causing a riot, Electro tries to run away with his waitress girlfriend, but is captured by the New Avengers, subsequently fainting when faced with the prospect of being beaten up by Luke Cage, using Spider-Man&#x27;s webbing to protect himself from Electro. Later, Electro joins Chameleon&#x27;s &quot;Exterminators&quot;, seeking to take advantage of Peter Parker and his loved ones. During the &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline, Electro is among the villains in Hammerhead&#x27;s unnamed villain army when Iron Man and S.H.I.E.L.D. raid the hideout. In &quot;Secret Invasion,&quot; Electro appears as member of Hood&#x27;s crime syndicate and attacks a Skrull force. After the Skrull posing as Edwin Jarvis kidnaps the baby of Luke Cage and Jessica Jones, the Avengers and the Fantastic Four begin going after everyone who is associated with the Skrulls. Because of this, Electro is confronted by Wolverine in an alley where, after a battle, he leaves Dillon beaten and unconscious.

Electro returns in issue 612 starting &quot;The Gauntlet&quot;, with a new look as his face is now scarred with lightning bolts and sporting a trench coat. The revamp was explained by writer Mark Waid, stating that artist Paul Azaceta &quot;tweaked the design a bit, adding some burn scars to reflect Electro&#x27;s current situation. As Electro gets older, as his body chemistry starts to shift into middle age, his powers are becoming more erratic and less easy for him to control. So he turns to a surprise Marvel villain – someone rarely, if ever, seen in the pages of &quot;Amazing&quot; – to level up.&quot; During his appearance in &quot;The Gauntlet&quot;, it is revealed that Electro has lost control over his powers: besides the physical disfigurement, his touch is now 100% lethal. Depressed and angry at the world because of this, Electro begins gathering other outcasts and misfits into a group known as &quot;Power To The People&quot;, which targets right-wing newspaper baron Dexter Bennett and the New York Stock Exchange in the wake of the 2008 Financial Crisis. Electro&#x27;s group manages to gain positive coverage in the media, hampering Spider-Man&#x27;s ability to convince Electro&#x27;s followers of his true evil nature.

Electro&#x27;s duplicitous nature causes him to betray his followers to align with the amoral Bennett in exchange for help finding a way to restore his powers to a controllable level. The Mad Thinker is able to come up with a process to cure Electro, but Spider-Man interferes with the process, turning Electro into an artificial electrical thunderbolt. Furious, Electro double-crosses Bennett and ultimately uses his new powers to destroy The DB building, crippling Bennett in the process. In doing so, Electro uses up so much of his newfound power that Spider-Man is able to neutralize him with his webbing. In the epilogue, Electro runs into Sasha Kravinoff and Chameleon in his new jail cell. In the following issue involving Sandman, it is revealed that Electro has escaped. Under the orders of the Kravinoffs, he breaks the fourth Vulture out of prison.

During the &quot;Heroic Age&quot; storyline, it is suspected by the Young Allies that Electro had a discarded and disavowed daughter named Aftershock (similar to the MC2 Universe version) who is a member of the Bastards of Evil. When Young Allies members Firestar and Gravity fight Electro, he defeats them and lets them live so that they can spread the message that he does not endorse Aftershock and the Bastards of Evil&#x27;s terrorism. He also says they can look up how and when he got his powers on the internet and there was no way a girl of Aftershock&#x27;s age could have been conceived after he got his powers: It is impossible for him to be Aftershock&#x27;s father. Electro is later present at the scene where Mattie Franklin is sacrificed by Sasha Kravinoff as part of a ritual that resurrects Vladimir Kravinoff as a large humanoid lion creature.

During the &quot;Origin of the Species&quot; storyline, Electro is among the supervillains invited by Doctor Octopus to reestablish the Sinister Six, where they are promised that they will receive a reward in exchange for securing some specific items. Electro goes after Spider-Man for Menace&#x27;s infant. Anticipating Spider-Man&#x27;s plan to deliver the infant to a hospital, Electro waits at the nearest hospital in Spider-Man&#x27;s area until Spider-Man shows up. The two begin to battle until Sandman interferes and Spider-Man tricks Electro into electrocuting Sandman, turning him into glass. Flying shards of glass hit Electro, temporarily stunning him and allowing Spider-Man to escape. Spider-Man goes on an angry rampage against all the villains after the Chameleon tricks him into thinking the infant is dead. He defeats Electro in Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn.

In the &quot;Big Time&quot; storyline, Electro becomes a member of Doctor Octopus&#x27; new Sinister Six and helps Chameleon break into an air force base in New Jersey. Electro was with the Sinister Six when it came to fighting Intelligencia. During a conflict between the Intelligencia and the Sinister Six, Mad Thinker was able to briefly deactivate Electro&#x27;s powers, but was caught off-guard when Electro physically attacked him instead, the surprise of the attack allowed Electro to defeat Mad Thinker. During the &quot;&#x27;Ends of the Earth&quot; storyline despite the Sinister Six being prepared for a fight with the Avengers, Electro was the first of the team to be defeated, being hurled into the upper atmosphere by Thor while distracted by his inability to attack Spider-Man&#x27;s new hi-tech armor.

Electro returns to Earth and attempts to avenge himself on Thor by forcing an A.I.M. scientist to convert him to generate protons instead of electrons, but he is defeated when Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus&#x27; mind in Spider-Man&#x27;s body) manages to convert him into a stream of protons and traps him. Superior Spider-Man places Electro in containment next to Sandman in his hidden underwater lab. Electro, Chameleon, Sandman, Mysterion, and the Vulture are later seen as part of a team led by Superior Spider-Man called the &quot;Superior Six&quot;. Superior Spider-Man has been temporarily controlling their minds to redeem them for their crimes. He does this by forcing them to do heroic deeds against their will, some of which almost get them killed. Every time he is done controlling them, he puts them back in their containment cells. They eventually break free of Superior Spider-Man&#x27;s control and attempt to exact revenge on the wall-crawler, nearly destroying New York to do so. With the help of Sun Girl, Superior Spider-Man is barely able to stop the Superior Six. Electro is later seen battling the Punisher in Los Angeles.

Sometime after Spider-Man regains his body, Electro comes into the Bar With No Name and is introduced to the Hobgoblin&#x27;s servants by his friend and bartender, Deke. The villains start joking about the gloomy Electro. One mentions how Thor launched him into space, another about how &quot;Spider-Man&quot; made him part of the Superior Six, and yet another about how Electro was taken out by the Punisher, despite the latter&#x27;s lack of powers. Electro gets angry and starts sparking, but the bartender gets the situation under control by commenting on how bad the Punisher is and with compliments like breaking so many villains out of the Raft, which earned him the respect of Crossbones and Count Nefaria. This does not stop the others, however. Determined to get respect, Electro heads back over to the Raft, ready for another breakout despite the Green Goblin having done the same just recently and the fact that it was re-christened as Spider-Island II. Electro sends a blot of electricity around, but it grows excessively big and he cannot turn it off. He finally exhausts all of his power but when this happens, he passes out and many of the villains he tried to break out are now dead. Vowing revenge, Electro soon realizes what caused this to happen to him: experiments conducted by &quot;Spider-Man&quot;.

Electro later visits his friend, Francine Frye, and keeps his distance because of his uncontrollable powers. Francine starts to kiss Electro, only to end up dying from electrocution. At Peter Parker&#x27;s behest, Parker Industries is testing out an anti-Electro netting that can capture Electro. Electro is later seen with Black Cat when they raid Eel&#x27;s hideout where Electro defeats Eel. Electro and Black Cat later crash the meeting between Mister Negative and Phil Urich (who is leading the remnants of the Goblin Underground as the self-proclaimed Goblin King) where they throw Eel&#x27;s body into the area where the meeting is. During Peter Parker&#x27;s interview on the Fact Channel, Electro attacks the security team on the channel and the Black Cat arrives, announcing her demand that if Spider-Man does not show up in 15 minutes, Peter Parker will be dead. Electro complains about the plan but Black Cat stays determined that Spider-Man will show up, but then Silk arrives to confront them both, giving Peter the time to change into Spider-Man and jump into action, aiding Silk. As she battles against Electro and Spider-Man deals with Black Cat, J. Jonah Jameson remains on the channel forcing the cameraman to film the action. Electro fails to stop Silk, but the Black Cat redirects one of Electro&#x27;s bolts into hitting Spider-Man, knocking him down in the process.

Electro pressures Sajani into telling him how effective the anti-Electro traps will be in removing his powers, but the Black Cat interrupts their talk to ask her how the device works. They both infiltrate the demonstration, suiting Electro into the &quot;Fake Electro&quot; costume while Black Cat disguises herself as one of the operators. Black Cat starts the machine, further enhancing Electro&#x27;s power, only to be interrupted by Spider-Man and Silk. Electro tries to escape but his insulated webbing protects him by allowing Silk to cover Electro with her webbing. Black Cat changes the plan, using the wiring to overload Electro by putting his powers way out of control, shooting his lightning bolts against the helicopter. Silk saves the helicopter and Spider-Man jumps into the machine, using his webbing to cover Electro to take him out of there. Electro asks to let go, but Spider-Man remains determined to hold him until they are both saved by Silk who pulls them out of the machine and away from the explosion which failed to kill Spider-Man as Black Cat wanted and she escapes. However, Electro was apparently de-powered and taken into custody.

As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot;, a de-powered Max Dillon is shown as an inmate at Andry Corrections Facility alongside Lizard. Upon being sprung out of the prison by Rhino, he meets a mysterious red-suited man who offers to restore Electro&#x27;s powers in exchange for his services. Jackal and Lizard work on the procedure that would re-power Maxwell Dillon. When Dillon was reluctant to go through with the procedure, Jackal brings in a woman who Dillon recognizes as Francine Frye minus the piercings and tattoos that are on her body. Dillon agrees to go ahead with the procedure. The Jackal cloned Francine from DNA taken from her charred cheek. Francine observes the Jackal&#x27;s attempt to restore Dillon&#x27;s powers, but the experiment fails, charging his suit but not his body. Unexpectedly, the DNA in Dillon&#x27;s saliva that was mixed in with Francine&#x27;s own DNA attracts the electrical energy to Francine. Desiring more, Francine leans in to kiss Dillon and kills him in the process while absorbing his powers as the resulting action burns Dillon&#x27;s body.

Upon building a special machine, Doctor Octopus resurrects Electro with his powers intact as Kindred comments on Electro&#x27;s abilities while stating that Doctor Octopus is getting closer to his true self. Doctor Octopus and Electro find Kraven the Hunter in the Savage Land hunting a dinosaur. Electro shocks the dinosaur as Doctor Octopus is instructed by Kindred to entice Kraven the Hunter by quoting &quot;The best way to entice your fourth recruit is to offer him your fifth&quot;.

Electro was among the villains who were captured by Ultra Living Brain. After Spider-Man defeated the Sinister Six-type Super-Adaptoid, Ultra Living Brain teleported the villains away.

Electro fought Spider-Man again where the fight affected Spider-Man&#x27;s spider-senses. During the battle, Spider-Man&#x27;s long-lost sidekick Spider-Boy showed up. To Spider-Man&#x27;s surprise, Spider-Boy revealed his fangs that he used to subject Electro to his paralyzing venom. Then Spider-Boy advised Spider-Man to web him up for the police and leave a &quot;Courtesy of Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man&quot; notice like he always does.

===Francine Frye===

Debuting in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; vol. 3 #2 (July 2014) Francine Frye is a woman who is a fan of supervillains. At some point, she befriended Electro. At the time when Electro was losing control of his abilities, she was visited by him. When attempting to kiss Electro, Francine died from electrocution.

Jackal later revived her as a clone, lacking her piercings and tattoos. She was summoned by the new Jackal to help persuade Electro to go through with the procedure that would repower him. It turned out that Electro&#x27;s saliva was mixed in with Francine&#x27;s DNA, which led to her kissing Dillon enough to kill him and becoming the second Electro. She later encountered Prowler, at the time when he infiltrated New U Technologies. During the chase, Electro accidentally caused the apparent death of Prowler causing Jackal to make a clone of him.

During the &quot;Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy&quot; storyline, Francine assists Rhino in attacking Spider-Man when he infiltrates New U Technologies. Both of them are defeated. When Prowler has not returned from his mission to Alcatraz, the villains he cloned start fighting again enough for Jackal to send Francine to have Madame Web&#x27;s clone find Prowler. Francine shocks the answers out of Madame Web&#x27;s clone as Julia Carpenter feels it on her end. After Julia Carpenter escapes, Francine confronts Prowler as his body starts failing. Prowler tries to escape Francine&#x27;s wrath in Alcatraz, which proves difficult with her powers and his dying body. Using his weapons, the gift shop, and his strategic thinking, Prowler manages to defeat the simple-minded Francine.

When Jackal&#x27;s police contact Chief Anderson tells him about where the clone of Gwen Stacy is, Jackal sends Rhino and Electro to Horizon University. When they retrieve the Gwen Stacy clone, she tells them to bring Kaine due to his encounter with the Carrion virus that might help in Jackal&#x27;s research. Anna Marie Marconi persuades them to bring her along too since she also studied Kaine and the drug. Both villains agree to the terms. Electro later assists Doctor Octopus into fighting Spectro, following his failed attempt to make off with a test subject, where she is able to knock him out.

Alongside Kaine, Electro was being studied by Doctor Octopus to find out how to perfect the &quot;Proto Clone&quot;. When Spider-Woman of Earth-65 tries to free Kaine, she is attacked by Electro. When Spider-Woman of Earth-65 leaves Prowler in an alley when he proves too weak to continue, he is found by Electro. Julia Carpenter arrives and fends Electro off as she tells Prowler that Spider-Man has stabilized the human and clone cells. When Electro gets the upper hand on Julia, Prowler sacrifices himself to stop Electro and dies in Julia&#x27;s arms. Electro is one of the few clones that was able to survive the inverse frequency and got away.

Electro later appears as a member of the Sinister Six (consisting of Hobgoblin, Bombshell, Spot and Sandman) led by Aaron Davis in a recolored Iron Spider armor. She accompanied them in their mission to steal a decommissioned S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. During the &quot;Hunted&quot; storyline, Electro was seen as a patron at the Pop-Up with No Name. Mayor Wilson Fisk&#x27;s operatives later freed Electro and she was recruited to join an all-female incarnation of the Sinister Syndicate. When Francine recaps to Janice how she got her powers, she learns that Janice is Tombstone&#x27;s daughter. After meeting its members, Electro was reluctant to join with them until she hears from Janice that their first mission given to them by Mayor Wilson Fisk to target Boomerang. This is enough to convince Electro to join as she asks them to put her down for two vegan cheeseburgers. The Sinister Syndicate begins their mission where they attack the F.E.A.S.T. building that Boomerang is volunteering at.

Boomerang tries to reason with Beetle and Electro who are still mad at him for betraying him. After getting Aunt May to safety, Peter Parker changes into Spider-Man and helps Boomerang fight the Syndicate. The Syndicate starts doing their formation until Spider-Man accidentally sets off Boomerang&#x27;s gaserang which knocks out Spider-Man enough for the Syndicate to make off with Boomerang. As Beetle has Electro write a proposal on how the Syndicate can use Boomerang as an example to the criminal underworld, Beetle leave while calling Wilson Fisk that they caught Boomerang as she is given the information on where the exchange can happen.

When Beetle returns to the headquarters, Electro is present when Mayor Wilson Fisk brings the full force of New York City to their headquarters demanding that they surrender Boomerang to him. When Spider-Man arrives to reason with Mayor Fisk, Electro claims that Spider-Man is buying them some time. The Syndicate then assists Spider-Man against Mayor Fisk&#x27;s forces. After Spider-Man evacuates Boomerang, the Syndicate fights Mayor Fisk&#x27;s forces while not killing them. The Syndicate is defeated and arrested by the police. Their transport is then attacked by an unknown assailant who frees them.

During the &quot;Sinister War&quot; storyline, Electro is with the Sinister Syndicate when they discuss adding Ana Kravinoff to their ranks until they are abducted by Kindred&#x27;s giant centipedes. Kindred offers them and the other villains the opportunity to take down Spider-Man and punish him for his sins. Electro and the rest of the Sinister Syndicate intercept Overdrive who is carrying Spider-Man away from Foreigner&#x27;s group.

During the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Reign&quot; storyline, Electro is among the characters that Mayor Wilson Fisk recruited to be part of his Thunderbolts units so that they can help the NYPD crack down on superhuman vigilantism. She assists Agony, Rhino, and U.S. Agent in taking down Moon Knight.

After Fisk is ousted as Mayor and replaced by Luke Cage, Electro joins Agent Gao&#x27;s Cape Killers in exchange for a lighter sentence as seen during the &quot;Carnage Reigns&quot; storyline.

Electro was with the Sinister Syndicate when they took Janice Lincoln out for a bachelorette party.

During the &quot;Gang War&quot;, Electro joins the Syndicate to support Janice instead of rejoining the Cape Killers. They raid one of Diamondback&#x27;s territories only to find Rose and Digger there having defeated some of Diamondback&#x27;s men before their arrival. Electro and the rest of the Sinister Syndicate fight Rose and Digger until some armored soldiers showed up with one of them quoting &quot;Light &#x27;em up&quot;! The armored soldiers are revealed to be working for Wilson Fisk as they take Rose away leaving Digger behind. When Madame Masque appears in Beetle&#x27;s lair, Beetle tells the rest of the Sinister Syndicate to give her a minute. Electro leaves to go take care of some business in the Bronx. When in the Bronx, Electro has a fight with Mary Jane Watson in her Jackpot outfit. She manages to escape by damaging a nearby bridge. Electro joined the rest of the Sinister Syndicate, Digger, and some gangs when it comes to face off against Madame Masque and the Maggia in Central Park. During the fight in Central Park, Electro and Lady Octopus face off against Shotgun and Rabble as Spider-Man and his allies arrive. As Tombstone order White Rabbit to have the Sinister Syndicate and those on their side to pull out of Central Park, Electro helps Trapstr immobilize She-Hulk and then zaps Spider-Man on their way out.

Electro appeared as a member of a Multiversal group called the Sinister Squadron where they attacked the Spider-Society before it can be formed.

==Powers and abilities==
An unusually configured magnetic field is created when Max Dillon is struck by lightning while holding live, high-tension wires and a wound reel of one-inch cable, granting him superhuman powers. Electro can generate massive quantities of electricity, up to approximately 100,000 volts. He can employ this electrostatic energy as lightning arcs from his fingertips, and his maximum charge is more than enough to kill a normal human. When his body is charged to high levels, he becomes superhumanly strong and fast. He can also glide over power lines by using the electricity contained therein for propulsion, and he has on occasion been shown to actually ride on lightning bolts.

During a stint in prison, Doctor Octopus gave him the ideas of ionizing metals and sparking the petroleum in the fuel tanks of vehicles as a way to generate explosions. He can charge himself up to make himself more powerful. He can also absorb the energy of electrical equipment such as a power plant to increase his powers further. In &quot;New Avengers&quot;, he was shown to fly and manipulate large amounts of electricity and machinery, when he freed all the prisoners at Ryker&#x27;s Island.

An experimental procedure heightens his powers, allowing Electro to store and absorb a seemingly limitless amount of electricity. He also seems to gain the power over magnetism to a certain degree, allowing him to manipulate magnetic fields and move objects in a manner similar to that of Magneto, and can overcome his old weakness to water by using the electromagnetic fields around him to vaporize water before it can touch him. He makes Spider-Man beg by stimulating the bioelectric currents in his brain, and is able to defeat Nate Grey by manipulating said currents in Nate&#x27;s brain to turn his own psionic powers against him.

Electro can override any electrically powered device and manipulate it according to his mental commands. By using an external electrical power source to recharge his body&#x27;s energy reserves, Electro can expend electricity indefinitely without diminishing his personal reserves. When he is fully charged, Electro is extremely sensitive to anything that may &quot;short circuit&quot; him, such as water. Electro propels himself along magnetic lines of force in objects that have great electrical potential, such as high-tension electrical lines. He can also create electrostatic bridges to traverse upon, at the cost of a great expenditure of energy.

During the events of the storyline &quot;The Gauntlet&quot;, Electro becomes a living artificial thunderbolt, allowing him to travel through electrical appliances such as going through a light bulb and exiting through any other electronic device connected to the power source. He is also able to transmit himself over Spider-Man&#x27;s web line.

==Reception==
During an interview with &quot;Newsarama&quot; about &quot;The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt&quot;, Mark Waid claimed that the character of Electro is &quot;one of the smart criminals who was saving what he&#x27;s been stealing from banks and savings and loans&quot;. He also described Electro as the &quot;anti-bailout guy&quot;.

A &quot;Comics Bulletin&quot; review published by Ray Tate of &quot;Young Allies #2&quot; described Electro&#x27;s appearance in that issue as &quot;a punk with a gimmick&quot;. He also claimed that the character &quot;never harbored a pathological hatred of Spider-Man&quot;, and that he instead &quot;developed a healthy loathing for Spidey because the Wall Crawler frequently interfered with his sole goal of larceny&quot;. Ray believes that Electro &quot;isn&#x27;t a wanton psychopath&quot;, but a &quot;bank robber with electrical powers&quot;, and that he is &quot;not nuts&quot; but &quot;a felon&quot;. These remarks show that Electro&#x27;s character is received not as being mentally ill, but simply a thieving villain.

In 2009, Electro was ranked as IGN&#x27;s 87th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.

In 2022, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked Electro 6th in their &quot;10 Most Powerful Silk Villains In Marvel Comics&quot; list.

While fixing a power line on his birthday, Dillon is electrocuted and falls into a tank of genetically engineered electric eels, which grant him electrical powers. Surviving the ordeal, a disfigured but drained Dillon heads to Times Square to &quot;charge&quot; himself with more electricity, but is confronted by Spider-Man. Initially excited, a stray shot from an NYPD sniper causes Dillon to believe Spider-Man set him up and attack him, only to be subdued by the former and sent to Ravencroft for study. Taking the name &quot;Electro&quot;, he is broken out by Harry Osborn, who requires his help in breaking into Oscorp. Electro agrees and is given a new suit to control his powers. After they successfully break in, Harry allows Electro to take over the electrical grid he designed and take control of New York&#x27;s electricity. Spider-Man confronts him once more and repairs the damage so Gwen Stacy can reactivate the grid and allow the web-slinger to overload Electro with his own electricity, causing the latter to explode.
** An alternate universe variant of Dillon appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot;, sporting an updated redesign more closely resembling his mainstream comics counterpart. Prior to his death in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot;, Electro is transported the MCU due to a botched spell and absorbs electricity from transmission towers outside of New York to restore his physical form until he is defeated by the MCU Spider-Man (later dubbed &quot;Peter-One&quot;) and Sandman and transported to the New York Sanctum. There, Electro learns he and his fellow prisoners were displaced from their native universes moments before they died fighting their respective versions of Spider-Man. Though Peter-One attempts to change their fates by curing them of their powers, the Green Goblin convinces the prisoners to fight back instead until they are defeated and cured by Peter-One, Electro&#x27;s Spider-Man, and a third Spider-Man and returned to their native universes by Doctor Strange.

<text>Maréchal Foch () is an inter-specific hybrid French red wine grape variety. It was developed at the Oberlin Institute in Colmar-Alsace, at the beginning of the 20th century, then known as Kuhlmann 188-2, by Eugène Kuhlmann&quot;.&quot; The variety arrived in the U.S. in 1946, where it was subsequently renamed Marechal Foch in honor of Marshall Ferdinand Foch, Supreme Allied Commander during the First World War. Some believe it to be a cross of Goldriesling (itself an intra-specific cross of Riesling and Courtiller Musqué) with a &quot;Vitis riparia&quot; - &quot;Vitis rupestris&quot; cross. Others contend that its pedigree is uncertain and may contain the grape variety Oberlin 595. It ripens early, is cold-hardy and resistant to fungal diseases. It is a teinturier, with pigmented juice as well as skins. The berry size is small, which makes it prone to bird injury. The quality of wine produced by Marechal Foch vines is highly dependent upon vine age, and the flavor profile associated with many new-world hybrid varietals is much reduced in examples made with fruit picked from older vines.

==Wine regions==

Marechal Foch was formerly commonly grown in the Loire, but today it is limited to a small number of hectares in Europe. Because it is a hybrid variety, cultivation for commercial wines in Europe is restricted by European Union regulation.

It is more extensively grown in North America, including southern Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia, as well as the eastern wine growing regions of the United States, where it ripens fully by the end of September. It is also commonly grown in Minnesota and Ohio. In the west, it is grown in Colorado in Delta County. Additionally, it is grown in Oregon&#x27;s Willamette Valley, Missoula, Montana and Canada&#x27;s Okanagan Valley and Comox Valley. Marechal Foch was introduced to Canadian vineyards in 1946 by Adhemar de Chaunac of Brights&#x27; wines, along with several other French hybrids.

However, the extent to which Marechal Foch is grown in Canada has been much reduced, due to an extensive vine-pull program in the early 1980s designed to replace hybrids with (&quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;) cultivars.

==Wines==
Marechal Foch is used to make a variety of styles of wine, ranging from a light red wine similar to Beaujolais to more extracted wines with intense dark &quot;inky&quot; purple colour and unique varietal character, and even sweet, fortified, Port-like wines. Wines made from Marechal Foch tend to have strong acidity, aromas of black fruits and, in some cases, toasted wheat, mocha, fresh coffee, bitter chocolate, vanilla bean, and musk. In the darker variants of the wine a strong &quot;gamey&quot; nose is also often described. Highly extracted, and more carefully produced wines made from older plantings of Marechal Foch have recently been successfully marketed as more expensive niche wines with a dedicated following.

==Related varieties==
The grape varieties Léon Millot, Lucie Kuhlman, and Marechal Foch came out of the same crossing, and are therefore related.

==Synonyms==

<text>The chachalacas, guans, and curassows are birds in the family Cracidae. These are species of tropical and subtropical Central and South America. The range of one species, the plain chachalaca, just reaches southernmost parts of Texas in the United States. Two species, the Trinidad piping guan and the rufous-vented chachalaca occur on the islands of Trinidad and Tobago respectively.

==Systematics and evolution==
The family Cracidae was introduced (as Craxia) by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815. The Cracidae are an ancient group that were thought to be related to the Australasian mound-builders of family Megapodiidae. The two families they were sometimes united in a distinct order, Craciformes, as in Munroe and Sibley&#x27;s 1993 &quot;World Checklist of Birds&quot;. However, the group is not monophyletic and more recent phylogenetic studies have found Megapodiidae and Cracidae to be successive early branching lineages of Galliformes.

Alternatively, all subfamilies except the Penelopinae could be lumped into the Cracinae. As the initial radiation of cracids is not well resolved at present (see below), the system used here seems more appropriate. It is also quite probable that entirely extinct subfamilies exist as the fossil record is utterly incomplete.

=== Evolution ===
Recent research has analyzed mt and nDNA sequences, morphological, and biogeographical data to study the phylogenetic relationships of cracid birds, namely the relationships among the genera (Pereira &quot;et al.&quot;, 2002), the relationships between the species of curassows (Pereira &amp; Baker, 2004) and between the piping- and wattled guans (Grau &quot;et al.&quot;, 2005). The traditional groups—chachalacas, guans, and curassows—are verified as distinct clades, but the horned guan represents the sole survivor of a very distinct and ancient lineage.

In addition, the molecular data suggest that the Cracidae originated in the Late Cretaceous, but the authors caution that this cannot be more than a hypothesis at present: as the rate of molecular evolution is neither constant over time nor uniform between genera and even species, dating based on molecular information has a very low accuracy over such long timespans and needs to be corroborated by fossil evidence. The fossil record of cracids is limited to a single doubtfully distinct genus of chachalaca, &quot;Boreortalis&quot; (Hawthorn Early Miocene of Florida, USA; may actually be a junior synonym of &quot;Ortalis&quot;) and some species in the modern genus &quot;Ortalis&quot;, however. This does not provide any assistance in evaluating the hypothesis (Pereira &quot;et al.&quot;, 2002) that the split between the 4 main lineages of our time occurred quite rapidly, approximately in the Oligocene or slightly earlier, somewhere between 40 and 20 mya.

The genera &quot;Procrax&quot; and &quot;Palaeonossax&quot; are often considered cracids, but this is not certain at all; they may belong to a related extinct lineage. Of these too, few good fossils are known, as they date to about the time when the modern groups presumably diverged. Should they be cracids, they are not unlikely to represent either some of the last members of the family before guans, chachalacas, etc. evolved, or very early representatives of these lineages.

Thus, the assumption that the modern diversity started to evolve in the late Paleogene, continuing throughout the Miocene and onwards, must also be considered hypothetical given the lack of robust evidence. Still, the &quot;molecular&quot; scenario is entirely possible considering what is known about the evolution and radiation of the Galloanserae, and consistent with the paleogeography of the Americas. The ichnotaxon &quot;Tristraguloolithus cracioides&quot; is based on fossil eggshell fragments from the Late Cretaceous Oldman Formation of southern Alberta, Canada which are similar to chachalaca eggs (Zelenitsky &quot;et al.&quot;, 1996), but in the absence of bone material their relationships cannot be determined except that they are apparently not from a dinosaur.

By comparison, speciation within curassows (&quot;Crax&quot;, &quot;Nothocrax&quot;, &quot;Pauxi&quot; and &quot;Mitu&quot;) and the piping/wattled guans is supported by better evidence. It was usually caused by changes in topography which divided populations (vicariant speciation), mainly due to the uplift of the Andes which led to the establishment of the modern river basins. The distribution of curassow and piping-guan species for the most part follows the layout of these river systems, and in the latter case, apparently many extinctions of populations in lowland areas (Grau &quot;et al.&quot;, 2005). Another result was that the wattled guan belongs to the same genus as the piping-guans, which thus use the older name &quot;Aburria&quot; (Grau &quot;et al.&quot;, 2005).

Originally interpreted as a turkey by Othniel Charles Marsh, &quot;Meleagris antiquus&quot; was referred to as Cracidae in 1964 by Pierce Brodkorb. It is nowadays considered unambiguously to be a Cariamiformes under Bathornithidae, and indeed a very different animal from cracids, being a 2 meter tall terrestrial predator. Similarly, &quot;Palaeophasianus&quot; has been reassigned to Geranoididae, a lineage of large, ostrich-like stem-cranes.

==Description==
Cracids are large birds, similar in general appearance to turkeys. The guans and curassows live in trees, but the smaller chachalacas are found in more open scrubby habitats. Many species are fairly long tailed, which may be an aide to navigating their largely arboreal existence. They are generally dull-plumaged, but the curassows and some guans have colourful facial ornaments. The birds in this family are particularly vocal, with the chachalacas taking their name from the sound of their call. Cracids range in size from the little chachalaca (&quot;Ortalis motmot&quot;), at as little as and , to the great curassow (&quot;Crax rubra&quot;), at nearly and .

==Behaviour and ecology==
These species feed on fruit, insects and worms. They build nests in trees, and lay two to three large white eggs, which only the female incubates alone. The young are precocial and are born with an instinct to immediately climb and seek refuge in the nesting tree. They are able to fly within days of hatching.

<text>Prince Dimitrie Sturdza (, in full Prince Dimitrie Alexandru Sturdza-Miclăușanu; 10 March 183321 October 1914) was a Romanian statesman and author of the late 19th century, and president of the Romanian Academy between 1882 and 1884. He is an aristocrat and member of the House of Sturdza.

==Biography==
Born in Iași, Moldavia, and educated there at the &quot;Academia Mihăileană&quot;, he continued his studies in Germany at Munich, Göttingen, Bonn, and Berlin. He took part in the political movements of the time.

Sturdza was private secretary to Prince Alexander John Cuza. He afterwards turned against the increasingly unsanctioned rule of Cuza: He became Minister of Public Instruction in 1859, and was one of the most zealous promoters of the overthrow of Cuza. In 1866, he joined Ion Brătianu and others in the deposition of Cuza and the election of Prince Charles of Hohenzollern (later King Carol I of Romania). He became a member of the Liberal government. In the cabinet of Bratianu, 1876–88, he repeatedly held ministerial posts.

In 1892 he was elected leader of the National Liberal Party in succession to Brătianu, and was four times Prime Minister. During his last term in office, in 1907, Sturdza was called by King Carol I to handle the crisis created by the peasants&#x27; revolt of March. Although noted for his capacity for work, he was also a nationalist, resentful of &quot;aliens&quot; (in line with the anti-Jewish policies of his party), and supported blocking non-Romanians from a large number of social positions. Sturdza was a notorious antisemite, supporting measures such as the expulsion of Romanian Jews, and he was known for his opposition towards the naturalization of the Jews in Romania. He was responsible for the exile of Romanian Jewish intellectuals Moses Gaster and Lazăr Şăineanu.

He was appointed permanent secretary of the Romanian Academy, and became a recognized authority on Romanian numismatics. As secretary of the academy he was instrumental in assisting the publication of the collections of historic documents made by Constantin Hurmuzachi (30 vols., Bucharest, 1876–1897), and other acts and documents, as well as a number of minor political pamphlets of transitory value.

His son , by then a Colonel in the Romanian Army, defected to the Germans in 1916, during World War I.

<text>Curassows are one of the three major groups of cracid birds. They comprise the largest-bodied species of the cracid family. Three of the four genera are restricted to tropical South America; a single species of &quot;Crax&quot; ranges north to Mexico. They form a distinct clade which is usually classified as the subfamily Cracinae.
==Evolution==
In line with the other 3 main lineages of cracids (chachalacas, true guans, and the horned guan), mt and nDNA sequence data indicates that the curassows diverged from their closest living relatives (probably the guans) at some time during the Oligocene, or c.35–20 mya (Pereira &quot;et al.&quot; 2002). This data must be considered preliminary until corroborated by material (e.g. fossil) evidence however.

What appears certain from analysis of the molecular data, calibrated against geological events that would have induced speciation, is that there are 2 major lineages of curassows: one containing only &quot;Crax&quot;, and another made up of &quot;Mitu&quot; and &quot;Pauxi&quot;. The position of the peculiar nocturnal curassow is not well resolved; it might be closer to the latter, but in any case, it diverged around the same time as the split between the two major lineages. All curassow genera appear to have diverged, in fact, during the Tortonian (early Late Miocene): the initial split took place some 10–9 mya, and &quot;Pauxi&quot; diverged from &quot;Mitu&quot; some 8–7.4 mya (but see genus article).(Pereira &amp; Baker 2004)

Unlike the other cracids, biogeography and phylogeny indicate that the extant lineages of curassows probably originated in the lowlands of the western/northwestern Amazonas basin, most likely in the general area where the borders of Brazil, Peru and Colombia meet. In the two larger genera, vicariant speciation seems to have played a major role.(Pereira &quot;et al.&quot; 2002, Pereira &amp; Baker 2004)
