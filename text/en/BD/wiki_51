<text>The Chindits, officially known as Long Range Penetration Groups, were special operations units of the British and Indian armies which saw action in 1943–1944 during the Burma Campaign of World War II. Brigadier Orde Wingate formed them for long-range penetration operations against the Imperial Japanese Army, especially attacking lines of communication deep behind Japanese lines.

The name Chindits is a corrupted form of &quot;Chinthe&quot; (), Burmese word for &quot;lion&quot;.

Their operations featured long marches through extremely difficult terrain, undertaken by underfed troops often weakened by diseases such as malaria and dysentery. Controversy persists over the extremely high casualty rate and the debatable military value of the achievements of the Chindits.

==Background and formation==
During the East African Campaign of 1940–41, Wingate – under General Archibald Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East Command – had begun to explore guerilla tactics, when he created and commanded a unit known as Gideon Force, composed of regular troops from Sudan and Ethiopia, as well as Ethiopean partisans. Gideon Force disrupted Italian supply lines and collected intelligence.

In 1942, after the disbandment of Gideon Force, Wavell – who had since been appointed Commander-in-Chief, India in New Delhi – requested the services of Wingate in Burma. It was intended that he would raise irregular forces to operate behind the Japanese lines, in a manner similar to Gideon Force. Wingate arrived in Burma in March 1942 and for two months, as Japanese forces advanced rapidly, toured the country developing his theories of long-range penetration, during the two months preceding the Japanese conquest of Burma. After returning to Delhi, he presented his proposals to Wavell.

===Organisation and training===
The first Chindit unit, the 77th Indian Infantry Brigade, was gradually formed in the area around Jhansi in the summer of 1942. Wingate took charge of the training of the troops in the jungles of central India during the rainy season. Half of the Chindits were British: the 13th Battalion, the King&#x27;s Liverpool Regiment (nominally a second-line battalion, which contained a large number of older men) and men from the former Bush Warfare School in Burma, who were formed into 142 Commando Company. The other portion of the force consisted of the 3rd Battalion, the 2nd Gurkha Rifles (a battalion that had only just been raised) and the 2nd Battalion, the Burma Rifles (a composite unit formed from several depleted battalions of Burmese troops that had retreated into India in 1942).

Wingate trained this force as long-range penetration units that were to be supplied by stores parachuted or dropped from transport aircraft and were to use close air support as a substitute for heavy artillery. They would penetrate the jungle on foot, essentially relying on surprise through mobility to target enemy lines of communication (a tactic that the Japanese had previously used in 1942 to great effect against British forces in Malaya and Burma).

The standard brigade and battalion structures were abandoned. The force was instead formed into eight columns, each of which was organised as: an infantry rifle company (with nine Bren light machine guns and three 2-inch mortars); a support group with the heavy weapons (four Boys anti-tank rifles, two medium Vickers machine guns and two light anti-aircraft guns); a reconnaissance platoon from the Burma Rifles; and a sabotage group from 142 Commando Company. Small detachments from the Royal Air Force (equipped with radios to call in air support), Royal Corps of Signals and Royal Army Medical Corps were attached to the column headquarters. The heavy weapons, radios, reserve ammunition, and rations and other stores were carried on mules, which would also provide an emergency source of food once their loads had been depleted. With 57 mule handlers, each British column numbered 306 men (the Gurkha columns were slightly stronger, with 369 men).

Each man carried more than of equipment, which was proportionally more than the mules carrying the support weapons and other stores. This included a personal weapon, such as the SMLE rifle or Sten Gun, ammunition, grenades, a machete or Gurkha kukri knife, seven days&#x27; rations, groundsheet, change of uniform and other assorted items. Much of this load was carried in an Everest carrier, which was essentially a metal rucksack frame without a pack.

Shortly before the first operation, one column was broken up to bring the remaining seven up to full strength. Two or more columns were commanded by a group headquarters, which in turn was commanded by the brigade headquarters.

==Operation Longcloth==

The original intent had been to use the Chindits as a part of a larger offensive. When this offensive was cancelled, Wingate convinced General Wavell to send the Chindits into Burma anyway. Accordingly, on 8 February 1943, Operation Longcloth commenced and 3,000 Chindits, Wingate with them, began their march into Burma.

The Chindits crossed the Chindwin River on 13 February and faced the first Japanese troops two days later. Two columns marched to the south and received their air supply drops in broad daylight to create an impression that they were the main attack. They even had a man impersonating a British general along with them. The RAF mounted air attacks on Japanese targets to support the deception. These columns were to swing east at the beginning of March and attack the main north-south railway in areas south of the main force. One column successfully carried out demolitions along the railway, but the other column was ambushed. Half of the ambushed column returned to India.

Five other columns proceeded eastward. Two, those of Michael Calvert and Bernard Fergusson, proceeded towards the main north-south railway in Burma. On 4 March, Calvert&#x27;s column reached the valley and demolished the railway in 70 places. Fergusson arrived two days later to do the same. Despite these successes, however, the railway was only temporarily disabled, and resumed operation shortly afterwards.

On many occasions, the Chindits could not take their wounded with them; some were left behind in villages. Wingate had, in fact, issued specific orders to leave behind all wounded, but these orders were not strictly followed. Since there were often no established paths in the jungle along their routes, many times they had to clear their own with machetes and kukris (and on one occasion, a commandeered elephant). Supply was delivered by air using three Hudsons and three Dakotas of 31 Squadron operating from Agartala in eastern Bengal.

Once in Burma, Wingate repeatedly changed his plans, sometimes without informing all the column commanders. The majority of two of the columns marched back to India after being ambushed by the Japanese in separate actions. After the railway attacks, Wingate decided to cross his force over the Irrawaddy River. However, the area on the other side of the river turned out to be inhospitable to operations. Water was difficult to obtain and the combination of rivers with a good system of roads in the area allowed the Japanese to force the Chindits into a progressively smaller &quot;box&quot;.

In late March, Wingate made the decision to withdraw the majority of the force, but sent orders to one of the columns to continue eastward. The operations had reached the range limit of air supply and prospects for new successful operations were low, given the Japanese pressure. The columns were generally left to make their own way back to India. On the journey back, the most difficult actions involved crossing back over the Irrawaddy River. The Japanese had observers and patrols all along the river bank and could quickly concentrate once an attempt at a crossing was detected. Gradually, all the columns broke up into small groups. Wingate&#x27;s headquarters returned to India on its own ahead of most of the columns. Through the spring and even into the autumn of 1943, individual groups of men from the Chindits made their way back to India. The army did what they could for the men. In one case, an aeroplane was landed in an open area and wounded men were evacuated by air. Part of one column made it to China. Another body of men escaped into the far north of Burma. Others were captured or died.

By the end of April, after a three-month mission, the majority of the surviving Chindits had crossed the Chindwin river, having marched between 750–1,000 miles. Of the 3,000 men that had begun the operation, a third (818 men) had been killed, taken prisoner or died of disease, and of the 2,182 men who returned, about 600 were too debilitated from their wounds or disease to return to active service. Of the remaining men, Wingate practically hand picked those few he would retain, while the rest were put back under the normal army command structure as part of their original battalions.

==Interlude==
Although British Army officers in India criticised the effectiveness of the Chindits (Japanese railway communications had been out of commission for less than a week), their effect on the morale of the Allied troops in India was refreshing, and they were given plenty of publicity.

Wingate wrote an operations report on returning to India, which was controversial for many reasons, including attacks on officers under his command. The report had a tendency to excuse any mistakes made by its author (Wingate), while making vicious attacks on other officers, often based on limited information. Eventually, through his political allies in London, a copy of the report was given to Winston Churchill, who was impressed and took Wingate with him to the Quebec Conference. His concepts for long-range penetration operations behind Japanese lines received official backing at high level, and he obtained substantial US support for his force. The US Army also began its own plans for the group that later became Merrill&#x27;s Marauders.

As the members of the first expedition were making their way back to India, a second long range penetration unit, 111th Indian Infantry Brigade was being formed. Popularly known as &quot;The Leopards&quot;, the brigade was raised by General Wavell without the knowledge of Wingate, who was still in Burma and who was known to have a strong dislike for the Indian Army, its diverse troop formations, and its British officers in particular. Wavell personally selected the commander of 111th Brigade, Brigadier Joe Lentaigne.

Wavell intended to use two Chindit brigades alternately during 1944. While one brigade was operating behind Japanese lines for two to three months at a time, the other would be resting in India, while training for and planning the next operation. However, Wingate returned from Quebec with authority to implement far more ambitious plans for the second expedition, which required that the force be greatly expanded to a strength of six brigades. Wingate refused to use Indian Army units in this force, because he maintained that their training in long-range penetration techniques would take longer and their maintenance by air would be difficult due to the varied dietary requirements of different Gurkha and Indian castes and religions, although he had little choice but to accept 111th Brigade, and two Gurkha battalions in 77th brigade. Since large numbers of trained British infantry were required, three brigades (the 14th, 16th and 23rd) were added to the Chindits by breaking up the experienced British 70th Infantry Division, much against the wishes of Lieutenant General William Slim and other commanders, who wished to use the division in a conventional role. A sixth brigade was added to the force by taking a brigade (the 3rd (West African) Infantry Brigade) from the British 81st (West Africa) Division.

At Quebec, Wingate had also succeeded in obtaining a &quot;private&quot; air force for the Chindits, the 1st Air Commando Group, mainly consisting of USAAF aircraft. The Chindits were greatly encouraged by having aircraft on which they could call immediately for supply drops, casualty evacuation and air support. Other welcome American aid was the &quot;K&quot; Ration pack which, although it provided insufficient calories for prolonged active operations, was far better than the equivalent British or Indian ration pack.

The forces for the second Chindit operation were called &quot;Special Force&quot;, officially 3rd Indian Infantry Division, or &quot;Long Range Penetration Groups&quot;, but the nickname, the Chindits, had already stuck.

The new Chindit force commenced training in Gwalior. Men were trained in crossing rivers, demolitions and bivouacking. Calvert and Fergusson, both newly promoted to Brigadier, took command of two of the brigades, and were responsible for much of the training program and the development of tactical planning. Wingate himself was absent for much of the training period, first being out of the country to attend the Quebec Conference and then struck ill with typhoid from drinking bad water in North Africa on his return.

===Plans===
The plans for the second Chindit operation went through many revisions.

The methods of the new Long Range Penetration force in 1944 differed from those of 1943. Wingate had decided on a strategy of creating fortified bases behind the Japanese lines, which would then send out raiding columns over short distances. This change was in part forced on him by strengthened Japanese patrols along the Burmese frontier, making a repeat of the successful infiltration in 1943 unlikely. In an imaginative move prompted by Colonel Philip Cochran&#x27;s assurance that he could transport both troops and supplies by glider, Wingate arranged for the bulk of the force to enter Burma by air, greatly accelerating the force&#x27;s ability to reach its target objectives. Advance units would land in gliders in preselected open fields in Burma, and prepare them for large-scale landings by transport aircraft. The lavish air support provided by Colonels Cochran and Alison of the 1st Air Commando Group proved critical to the success of the operation.

Wingate also had plans for a general uprising of the Kachin population of Northern Burma. He fought over these plans with the leadership of Force 136 (an organisation set up to liaise with resistance forces in Japanese-occupied countries), which was concerned that a premature uprising of the Kachins without a permanent British military presence would lead to their slaughter by the Japanese at the end of operations. Force 136 also had their own plans for a rising to be coordinated with the arrival of the regular army in Burma. Wingate was eventually convinced to scale back his original plans. Further complicating relations between the organisations were orders issued by Wingate to the commander of Dah Force (a British-led force of Kachin irregulars attached to the Chindits) not to coordinate operations with Force 136 for security reasons.

During the last months of 1943, planning was conducted to carry out the strategy for India as originally determined at the Quebec Conference. In November, the overall plan for the dry season campaign of 1944 determined by South East Asia Command focused on the use of the Chindits in the reconquest of northern Burma. These plans were approved by the Combined Chiefs of Staff at the Cairo Conference and although other offensives in Burma were scaled back or cancelled, Stilwell&#x27;s Northern Front offensive with the Chindits&#x27; participation survived the cuts. The uncertainty of the plans nevertheless meant that the plans and contingency plans for the use of the Chindits repeatedly changed up to the very start of operations.

The Chindits were assigned the task of helping the forces of Joseph Stilwell push the Ledo Road through northern Burma to link up with the Burma Road and re-establish an overland supply route to China, by mounting a long range penetration operation behind the Japanese opposing his forces on the Northern Front. It had originally been intended that the IV Corps would attack on the Central Front and cross the Chindwin to tie up Japanese forces which could otherwise be used to aid the Northern Front. As the Japanese launched their own attack on the Central Front this advance did not take place, but it still meant that most Japanese forces were engaged on the Central Front and were not available to reinforce the Japanese 18th Division on the Northern Front. The Japanese offensive on the Central Front resulted in further proposals and refinements of the plans for the Chindits.

On 4 February 1944, Lieutenant General Slim, commander of the British Fourteenth Army, and USAAF General George E. Stratemeyer, commander of Eastern Air Command, issued a joint directive to General Wingate and Cols. Cochran and Alison of the 1st Air Commando Group, to march and fly into Indaw and from there under the command of the Fourteenth Army carry out the objectives of:

(i) Helping the advance of Stilwell&#x27;s Ledo force on Myitkyina by cutting the communications of the Japanese 18th Division, harassing its rear, and preventing its reinforcement.&lt;br&gt;(ii) Creating a favourable situation for the Yunnan Chinese forces to cross the Salween and enter Burma.&lt;br&gt;(iii) Inflicting the greatest possible damage and confusion on the enemy in North Burma.

==Operation Thursday==

On 5 February 1944, Fergusson&#x27;s 16th Brigade left Ledo for Burma. They avoided Japanese forces by traversing exceptionally difficult terrain. The rest of the Brigades were brought in by air to create fortified bases with airstrips.

Three landing zones, codenamed &quot;Piccadilly&quot;, &quot;Broadway&quot; and &quot;Chowringhee&quot;, were selected. Calvert&#x27;s 77th Brigade prepared to fly by Hadrian glider into &quot;Piccadilly&quot; on the night of 5 March. A last-minute aerial reconnaissance revealed &quot;Piccadilly&quot; to be covered with logs, making landing impossible. In some accounts of the incident, Wingate insisted that the operation had been betrayed and that the other landing zones would be ambushed. To proceed would be &quot;murder&quot;. Slim accepted the responsibility of ordering a willing Calvert to proceed with the operation, using &quot;Broadway&quot; instead. While &quot;Piccadilly&quot; had already been used to evacuate casualties during the first Chindit operation in 1943, &quot;Broadway&quot; had to be selected from the results of aerial reconnaissance. It turned out to be a poor landing ground and there were many casualties in crash landings, but Calvert&#x27;s men were just able to make the strip fit to take transport aircraft the next day. Chindit gliders also landed on &quot;Chowringhee&quot; the next day, without opposition.

It was later revealed that the logs on &quot;Piccadilly&quot; had been placed there to dry by Burmese teak loggers. The real problem was the failure to maintain continuous observation of the landing zones (e.g. by high-flying Spitfire photo-reconnaissance aircraft) before the forces were deployed.

Over the next week, 600 sorties by Dakota transport aircraft transferred 9,000 men to the landing zones. &quot;Chowringhee&quot; was abandoned once the fly-in was completed, but &quot;Broadway&quot; was held with a garrison which included field artillery, anti-aircraft guns and even a detachment of six Mk.VIII Spitfires of No.81 Squadron RAF from 12 March to 17 March. On 17 March they were attacked during take-off by Japanese Ki-43 &#x27;Oscars&#x27;. S/L William &#x27;Babe&#x27; Whitamore and F/O Alan M Peart managed to get airborne, with both shooting down one &#x27;Oscar&#x27; each. Whitamore was shot down and killed but Peart survived for over half an hour, holding off over 20 enemy fighters. The remaining Spitfires were destroyed on the ground for the loss of another pilot, F/Lt Coulter. Peart flew back to Kangla the same day in his damaged Spitfire (FL-E JF818) and reported the action. The detachment was duly ended by AVM Stanley Vincent, the CO of No. 221 Group.

Fergusson&#x27;s brigade set up another base named &quot;Aberdeen&quot; north of Indaw, into which 14th Brigade was flown. Calvert&#x27;s brigade established yet another, named &quot;White City&quot; at Mawlu, astride the main railway and road leading to the Japanese northern front. 111 Brigade set up ambushes and roadblocks south of Indaw (although part of the brigade which landed at &quot;Chowringhee&quot; was delayed in crossing the Irrawaddy River), before moving west to Pinlebu.

Ferocious jungle fighting ensued around &quot;Broadway&quot; and &quot;White City&quot;. At times, British and Japanese troops were in close combat, bayonets and kukris against katanas. On 27 March, after days of aircraft attack, the Japanese attacked &quot;Broadway&quot; for several nights before the attack was repulsed with flown-in artillery and the aid of locally recruited Kachin irregulars.

However, a setback occurred when Fergusson&#x27;s brigade tried to capture Indaw on 24 March. The original intention had been to seize the town and its airfields on 15 March but Fergusson had to report that this was impossible. Wingate appeared ready to change the brigade&#x27;s mission but on 20 March, he reinstated Indaw as the target. The brigade was already exhausted from its long march, and there was no time to properly reconnoitre the objective. The units were dismayed to find that the Japanese controlled the only water sources. Fergusson expected that 14th Brigade would cooperate in the attack, but they moved west instead. Japanese reinforcements had also moved into Indaw, which was a major road and rail centre. Fergusson&#x27;s battalions, attacking separately, were each repulsed. Calvert later commented &quot;They had attacked as clutching fingers from all sides, and not as a fist&quot;. After this, most of the tired 16th Brigade were flown out.

===Change of command===
On 24 March, Wingate flew to Imphal to confer with air force commanders. On the return journey, the USAAF B-25 bomber in which he was flying is believed to have flown into a thunderstorm and crashed in the jungle-covered mountains. All aboard were killed.

Slim, the commander of the Fourteenth Army which had loose operational control over Special Force, selected Brigadier Lentaigne to be Wingate&#x27;s replacement after conferring with Brigadier Derek Tulloch, Wingate&#x27;s Chief of Staff. Lentaigne was judged to be the most balanced and experienced commander in the force; he had been an instructor at the Staff College at Quetta, had led a Gurkha battalion with distinction during the gruelling retreat from Burma in 1942 and had commanded a Chindit brigade in the field (albeit for only a few weeks, but none of the other brigade commanders had more experience). As an officer of Gurkha troops, he had a similar outlook and background to Slim. The other Chindit brigade commanders were unknown quantities, mostly without staff qualifications, some of whom had never even commanded a battalion-sized unit in combat before 1944, and Wingate&#x27;s staff officers lacked the necessary combat experience. The force&#x27;s second-in-command, Major General George William Symes, was bypassed by Slim and formally protested and asked to be relieved. In selecting Lentaigne, Slim did not take into account the tensions between those Chindit commanders and staff who were closely associated with Wingate, and Lentaigne, who had a classical &quot;line&quot; officer&#x27;s background and had been critical of Wingate&#x27;s methods and techniques.

===The move north===
Several major changes were made at the highest level. Much of the air support was diverted to the critical battles of Imphal and Kohima, where troops were cut off and could only be resupplied by air. 23rd Brigade, yet to fly in, was also despatched to Kohima. Those Chindits already operating in Burma were formally subordinated to General Joseph Stilwell, who ordered the Chindits to abandon their dispersed operations around Indaw, and concentrate on interdicting the supply lines to the Japanese forces opposing his Northern Combat Area Command.

In April, Lentaigne ordered the main body of 111 Brigade west of the Irrawaddy, now commanded by John Masters, to move north and build a new stronghold, codenamed &quot;Blackpool&quot;, which would block the railway and main road at Hopin, south of Mogaung. Calvert was ordered to abandon &quot;White City&quot; and &quot;Broadway&quot; and move north to support Masters. Calvert was opposed to this, as his brigade had successfully held these two strongholds for months. Stilwell also feared that abandoning &quot;White City&quot; would allow Japanese reinforcements to move north. However, Lentaigne insisted that the Chindit brigades were too far apart to support each other, and that the airstrips at &quot;White City&quot; and &quot;Broadway&quot; would be unusable during the monsoon.

Masters&#x27;s force established &quot;Blackpool&quot; on 8 May and was almost immediately engaged in fierce fighting. Whereas &quot;White City&quot; had been deep in the Japanese rear, its defenders had had plenty of time to prepare their defences and its attackers had been a mixed bag of detachments from several formations, &quot;Blackpool&quot; was close to the Japanese northern front, and was immediately attacked by Japanese troops with heavy artillery support. As Calvert and Stilwell had feared, abandoning &quot;White City&quot; had allowed the Japanese 53rd Division to move north from Indaw. A heavy attack against &quot;Blackpool&quot; was repulsed on 17 May, but a second attack on 24 May captured vital positions inside the defences.

Because the monsoon had broken and heavy rain made movement in the jungle very difficult, neither Calvert nor Brodie&#x27;s 14th Brigade could help Masters. Finally, Masters had to abandon &quot;Blackpool&quot; on 25 May, because the men were exhausted after 17 days of continual combat. Nineteen Allied soldiers, who were so badly injured as to be beyond hope of recovery and could not be moved, were shot by the medical orderlies and hidden in heavy stands of bamboo.

===Final operations===
On 17 May, Slim had formally handed control of the Chindits to Stilwell. Stilwell insisted that the Chindits capture several well-defended Japanese positions. The Chindits had no support from tanks or artillery and this led to heavier casualties than before. According to David Rooney, the Chindits were misused under Stillwell&#x27;s command and suffered heavy casualties undertaking roles for which they were neither trained nor equipped.

Over the period 6 June to 27 June, Calvert&#x27;s 77th Brigade took Mogaung and suffered 800 casualties – 50 per cent of the brigade&#x27;s men involved in the operation. Fearing that they would then be ordered to join the siege of Myitkyina, Calvert handed Mogaung over to Force X, shut down his radios and retreated to Kamaing, where Stilwell had his headquarters. A court-martial was likely until Stilwell and Calvert met in person, and Stilwell finally appreciated the conditions under which the Chindits had been operating.

111 Brigade, after resting, was ordered to capture a hill south west of Mogaung, known as Point 2171. It did so but was now utterly exhausted. Most of the men were suffering from malaria, dysentery and malnutrition. On 8 July, at the insistence of the Supreme Commander, Admiral Louis Mountbatten, doctors examined the brigade. Of the 2,200 men present from four and a half battalions, only 119 were declared fit. The brigade was evacuated, although Masters sarcastically kept the fit men, &quot;111 Company&quot;, in the field until 1 August.

The portion of 111 Brigade east of the Irrawaddy were known as &quot;Morris Force&quot;, after its commander, Lieutenant-Colonel J. R. &quot;Jumbo&quot; Morris. They had spent several months harassing Japanese traffic from Bhamo to Myitkyina. They had then attempted to complete the encirclement of Myitkyina. Stilwell was angered that they were unable to do so but Slim pointed out that Stilwell&#x27;s Chinese troops (numbering 5,500) had also failed. By 14 July, Morris Force was down to three platoons. A week later, they only had 25 men fit for duty. Morris Force was evacuated about the same time as the 77th Brigade.

The 14th Brigade and the 3rd West African Brigade remained in action, assisting the newly arrived 36th Infantry Division in its advance down the &quot;Railway Valley&quot; south of Mogaung. Finally, they were relieved and withdrawn, starting on 17 August. The last Chindit left Burma on 27 August 1944.

===Kohima===

23rd Brigade, which had been diverted from the main Chindit campaign, nevertheless acted as a long range penetration unit behind the Japanese fighting at Kohima. From April to June 1944, they marched long distances through the Naga hills, mostly in monsoon weather which made movement very difficult. They contributed in large measure to the starvation of the Japanese at Kohima, the decisive factor in that battle. Although not engaged in major battles, they accounted for large numbers of Japanese stragglers and foragers, suffering 158 battle casualties themselves.

==Disbanded==
The Chindits had suffered heavy casualties: 1,396 killed and 2,434 wounded. Over half had to be confined to hospital and prescribed a special nutritional diet whilst hospitalised. As bad as the casualty figures may seem, those suffered by the force in 1943 were proportionally much higher.

The healthy men were sent to training camps to await new operations. However, when the army command evaluated the men and equipment required to return the Chindits to operational status, it was decided to transform the force into an Airborne Division in India. Beyond direct replacements, it was known that the British element of the Chindits would be decimated in 1945 by the need to repatriate personnel who had served more than four years overseas.

During the early months of 1945, several of the brigade headquarters and many of the veterans of the Chindit operations were reformed into the 14th and 77th Infantry Brigades and merged into the 44th Airborne Division (India), while the force headquarters and signals units formed the core of the Indian XXXIV Corps. The Chindits were finally disbanded in February 1945.

==London memorial==

There is a memorial to Orde Wingate and the Chindits on the north side of the Victoria Embankment next to the Ministry of Defence headquarters in London. The memorial was unveiled on 16 October 1990 by the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. The front of the monument is in memory of the Chindits and also mentions the four men of the Chindits awarded the Victoria Cross: Major Frank Gerald Blaker, Captain Michael Allmand and Lieutenant George Albert Cairns and Rifleman Tulbahadur Pun. The battalions that took part are listed on the sides of the monument. Non-infantry units are mentioned by their parent formations only. No distinction is made between those units that took part in 1943 versus those of 1944. The rear of the monument is exclusively dedicated to Orde Wingate and also mentions his contributions to Israel. The memorial is a 4 metre (13 ft) high Portland stone pillar mounted on three steps, on which is a statue by Frank Forster of the chinthe, after which the Chindits are named.

==Military legacy==
Military historians disagree on the Chindits&#x27; military significance. The debate is part of the ongoing one of whether the deployment of special forces are a net asset to a campaign or whether the investment in time, material and men that such operations demand outweigh the advantages gained. For example, it is questioned whether the interdiction of Japanese supply lines during Operation Thursday by the Chindits contributed more to Stilwell&#x27;s advance than if the resources committed to the operation had been used to provide Stilwell with another regular division to fight alongside his X Force. However, the Japanese subsequently admitted that the Chindits had disrupted their plans for the first half of 1943. Japanese commander, Mutaguchi Renya, later stated that Operation Thursday had a significant effect on the campaign, saying &quot;The Chindit invasion ... had a decisive effect on these operations ... they drew off the whole of 53 Division and parts of 15 Division, one regiment of which would have turned the scales at Kohima.&quot;

The views of the majority of the post-war British military establishment were made succinctly by Slim (commander of the Fourteenth Army), when he wrote &quot;... the Chindits, gave a splendid example of courage and hardihood. Yet I came firmly to the conclusion that such formations, trained, equipped and mentally adjusted for one kind of operation were wasteful. They did not give, militarily, a worth-while return for the resources in men, materiel and time that they absorbed. ... [Special forces] were usually formed by attracting the best men ... The result of these methods was undoubtedly to lower the quality of the rest of the Army&quot;. He makes several other arguments against special forces, about the danger of ordinary battalions thinking that some tasks could only be performed by special forces, and that special forces can only stay in the field for relatively short periods compared to regular battalions. He sums up that &quot;Anything, whatever the short cuts to victory it may promise, which thus weakens the Army spirit is dangerous&quot;. To underline his point he suggests that &quot;This cult of special forces is as sensible as to form a Royal Corps of Tree Climbers and say that no soldier, who does not wear its green hat with a bunch of oak leaves stuck in it should be expected to climb a tree&quot;. He does acknowledge the need for small units to stir up trouble in the enemy&#x27;s rear area but does not make it clear if he is talking about V Force or the actions of Force 136.

Others, like Sir Robert Thompson, an ex-Chindit, have asserted that the idea behind the Chindits was a sound one but that they were just badly handled and used in operations for which they were not properly equipped or trained, for example in static defence. A third view is that, despite the relatively insignificant losses that the Chindits were able to inflict, their propaganda value in 1943, at a time when the Army was on the defensive, was a morale boost to the people of India and Britain, and helping to dispel the image of Japanese invincibility. It has been hard to reach a consensus on any of these issues due to the partisan nature of the discussions surrounding Wingate.

It has also been argued that the Chindits contributed to the overall success of the Allied armies in Burma through the innovations in air supply techniques and organisation that their operations required. The Allied air forces were later to use these tactics to supply increasingly large forces that were cut off by the enemy, or were operating independently of road or rail lines of communication. Conversely, it has been argued that the apparent success of the Chindits led some Japanese commanders to believe that they could employ their own incursion tactics on a much larger scale, and that when they came to implement such tactics during the Chindwin offensive of early 1944, lacking the necessary air support that had enabled the Allies to be successful, the result was disastrous and ultimately led to defeat at both Kohima and Imphal, and later on the plains of Burma in 1945.

Three of the Brigade commanders on &quot;Operation Thursday&quot; (two of whom had also served in the first Chindit expedition) subsequently wrote autobiographies, which contained their comments on the Chindits&#x27; concept and practice of operations. Bernard Fergusson, originally an enthusiastic supporter of Wingate, later came to feel that Wingate lacked both consistency and flexibility in his plans, which contributed to Fergusson&#x27;s long, pointless march from Ledo and his defeat at Indaw. John Masters, who was a friend of Lentaigne, felt that the Chindits&#x27; mobility was sacrificed in holding fixed defensive positions or attacking strong Japanese positions, without the necessary support. In criticism of the whole Chindit concept, he pointed out that the Chindit force had the infantry strength of two and a half line divisions but without supporting arms, had the fighting strength of less than one. Michael Calvert, who was closest to Wingate, remained a defender of Wingate and his methods.

The 77th Brigade, raised in 2015 to engage in propaganda for the army, was named in tribute to the Chindits.

<doc id="262875" wikidata="Q2161912" url="?curid=262875" title="Tichborne case">
<text>The Tichborne case was a legal &quot;cause célèbre&quot; that fascinated Victorian Britain in the 1860s and 1870s. It concerned the claims by a man sometimes referred to as Thomas Castro or as Arthur Orton, but usually termed &quot;the Claimant&quot;, to be the missing heir to the Tichborne baronetcy. He failed to convince the courts, was convicted of perjury and served a 14-year prison sentence.

Roger Tichborne, heir to the family&#x27;s title and fortunes, was presumed to have died in a shipwreck in 1854 at age 25. His mother, Lady Tichborne, clung to a belief that he might have survived, and after hearing rumours that he had made his way to Australia, she advertised extensively in Australian newspapers, offering a reward for information. In 1866, a Wagga Wagga butcher known as Thomas Castro came forward claiming to be Roger Tichborne. Although his manners and bearing were unrefined, he gathered support and travelled to England. He was instantly accepted by Lady Tichborne as her son, although other family members were dismissive and sought to expose him as an impostor.

During protracted enquiries before the case went to court in 1871, details emerged suggesting that the Claimant might be Arthur Orton, a butcher&#x27;s son from Wapping in London, who had gone to sea as a boy and had last been heard of in Australia. After a civil court had rejected the Claimant&#x27;s case, he was charged with perjury; while awaiting trial he campaigned throughout the country to gain popular support. In 1874, a criminal court jury decided that he was not Roger Tichborne and declared him to be Arthur Orton. Before passing a sentence of 14 years, the judge condemned the behaviour of the Claimant&#x27;s counsel, Edward Kenealy, who was subsequently disbarred because of his conduct.

After the trial, Kenealy instigated a popular radical reform movement, the Magna Charta Association, which championed the Claimant&#x27;s cause for some years. Kenealy was elected to Parliament in 1875 as a radical independent but was not an effective parliamentarian. The movement was in decline when the Claimant was released in 1884, and he had no dealings with it. In 1895, he confessed to being Orton, only to recant almost immediately. He lived generally in poverty for the rest of his life and was destitute at the time of his death in 1898. Although most commentators have accepted the court&#x27;s view that the Claimant was Orton, some analysts believe that an element of doubt remains as to his true identity and that, conceivably, he was Roger Tichborne.

==Sir Roger Tichborne==
===Tichborne family history===
The Tichbornes, of Tichborne Park near Alresford in Hampshire, were an old English Catholic family who had been prominent in the area since before the Norman Conquest. After the Reformation in the 16th century, although one of their number was hanged, drawn and quartered for complicity in the Babington Plot to assassinate Queen Elizabeth I, the family in general remained loyal to the Crown, and in 1621 Benjamin Tichborne was created a baronet for services to King James I.

Sir Henry Tichborne, the seventh baronet, was travelling through Verdun, France, when the Peace of Amiens broke down in May 1803, reigniting the Napoleonic Wars. As an enemy citizen, he was detained by the French authorities, who held him in captivity as a civil prisoner for some years. He shared his captivity with his fourth son, James, and a nobly born Englishman, Henry Seymour of Knoyle. During his confinement, Seymour managed to conduct an affair with the daughter of the Duc de Bourbon, which produced a daughter, Henriette Felicité, born in about 1807. Years later, when Henriette had passed her 20th birthday and remained unmarried, Seymour thought his former companion James Tichborne might make a suitable husbandalthough James was close to his own age and was physically unprepossessing. The couple were married in August 1827; on 5 January 1829 Henriette gave birth to a son, Roger Charles Doughty Tichborne.

Sir Henry had been succeeded in 1821 by his eldest son, Henry Joseph, who fathered seven daughters but no male heir. As baronetcies are inherited only by males, when Henry Joseph died in 1845 the immediate heir was his younger brother Edward, who had assumed the surname of Doughty as a condition of a legacy. Edward&#x27;s only son died in childhood, so James Tichborne became next in line to the baronetcy, and after him, Roger. As the family&#x27;s fortunes had been greatly augmented by the Doughty bequest, this was a considerable material prospect.

After Roger&#x27;s birth, James and Henriette had three more children: two daughters who died in infancy and a second son, Alfred, born in 1839. The marriage was unhappy, and the couple spent much time apart, he in England, she in Paris with Roger. As a consequence of his upbringing, Roger spoke mainly French, and his English was heavily accented. In 1845 James decided that Roger should complete his education in England and placed him in the Jesuit boarding school Stonyhurst College, where he remained until 1848. In 1849 he sat the British army entrance examinations and then took a commission in the 6th Dragoon Guards, in which he served for three years, mainly in Ireland.

When on leave, Roger often stayed with his uncle Edward at Tichborne Park and became attracted to his cousin Katherine Doughty, four years his junior. Sir Edward and his wife, though they were fond of their nephew, did not consider marriage between first cousins desirable. At one point the young couple were forbidden to meet, though they continued to do so clandestinely. Feeling harassed and frustrated, Roger hoped to escape from the situation through a spell of overseas military duty; when it became clear that the regiment would remain in the British Isles, he resigned his commission. On 1 March 1853 he left for a private tour of South America on board &quot;La Pauline&quot;, bound for Valparaíso in Chile.

===Travels and disappearance===

On 19 June 1853 &quot;La Pauline&quot; reached Valparaíso, where letters informed Roger that his father had succeeded to the baronetcy, Sir Edward having died in May. In all, Roger spent 10 months in South America, accompanied in the first stages by a family servant, John Moore. In the course of his inland travels he may have visited the small town of Melipilla, which lies on the route between Valparaíso and Santiago. Moore, who had fallen ill, was paid off in Santiago, while Roger travelled to Peru, where he took a long hunting trip. By the end of 1853 he was back in Valparaíso, and early in the new year he began a crossing of the Andes. At the end of January, he reached Buenos Aires, where he wrote to his aunt, Lady Doughty, indicating that he was heading for Brazil, then Jamaica and finally Mexico. The last positive sightings of Roger were in Rio de Janeiro, in April 1854, awaiting a sea passage to Jamaica. Although he lacked a passport he secured a berth on a ship, the &quot;Bella&quot;, which sailed for Jamaica on 20 April.
On 24 April 1854 a capsized ship&#x27;s boat bearing the name &quot;Bella&quot; was discovered off the Brazilian coast, together with some wreckage but no personnel, and the ship&#x27;s loss with all hands was assumed. The Tichborne family were told in June that Roger must be presumed lost, though they retained a faint hope, fed by rumours, that another ship had picked up survivors and taken them to Australia. Sir James Tichborne died in June 1862, at which point, if he was alive, Roger became the 11th baronet. As he was by then presumed dead, the title passed to his younger brother Alfred, whose financial recklessness rapidly brought about his near-bankruptcy. Tichborne Park was vacated and leased to tenants.

Encouraged by a clairvoyant&#x27;s assurance that her elder son was alive and well, in February 1863 Roger&#x27;s mother Henriette, now Lady Tichborne, began placing regular newspaper advertisements in &quot;The Times&quot; offering a reward for information about Roger Tichborne and the fate of the &quot;Bella&quot;. None of these produced results; however, in May 1865 Lady Tichborne saw an advertisement placed by Arthur Cubitt of Sydney, Australia, on behalf of his &quot;Missing Friends Agency&quot;. She wrote to him, and he agreed to place a series of notices in Australian newspapers. These gave details of the &quot;Bella&quot;&#x27;s last voyage and described Roger Tichborne as &quot;of a delicate constitution, rather tall, with very light brown hair and blue eyes&quot;. A &quot;most liberal reward&quot; would be given &quot;for any information that may definitely point out his fate&quot;.

==Claimant appears==
===In Australia===

In October 1865 Cubitt informed Lady Tichborne that William Gibbes, a lawyer from Wagga Wagga, had identified Roger Tichborne in the person of a bankrupt local butcher using the name Thomas Castro. During his bankruptcy examination Castro had mentioned an entitlement to property in England. He had also talked of experiencing a shipwreck and was smoking a briar pipe which carried the initials &quot;R.C.T.&quot; When challenged by Gibbes to reveal his true name, Castro had initially been reticent but eventually agreed that he was indeed the missing Roger Tichborne; henceforth he became generally known as the Claimant.

Cubitt offered to accompany the supposed lost son back to England and wrote to Lady Tichborne requesting funds. Meanwhile, Gibbes asked the Claimant to make out a will and to write to his mother. The will incorrectly gave Lady Tichborne&#x27;s name as &quot;Hannah Frances&quot;, and disposed of numerous non-existent parcels of supposed Tichborne property. In the letter to his mother, the Claimant&#x27;s references to his former life were vague and equivocal but were enough to convince Lady Tichborne that he was her elder son. Her willingness to accept the Claimant may have been influenced by the death of her younger son, Alfred, in February.

In June 1866 the Claimant moved to Sydney, where he was able to raise money from banks on the basis of a statutory declaration that he was Roger Tichborne. The statement was later found to contain many errors, although the birthdate and parentage details were given correctly. It included a brief account of how he had arrived in Australia: he and others from the sinking &quot;Bella&quot;, he said, had been picked up by the &quot;Osprey&quot;, bound for Melbourne. On arrival he had taken the name Thomas Castro from an acquaintance from Melipilla and had wandered for some years before settling in Wagga Wagga. He had married a pregnant housemaid, Mary Ann Bryant, and taken her child, a daughter, as his own; a further daughter had been born in March 1866.

While in Sydney the Claimant encountered two former servants of the Tichborne family. One was a gardener, Michael Guilfoyle, who at first acknowledged the identity of Roger Tichborne but later changed his mind when asked to provide money to facilitate the return to England. The second, Andrew Bogle, was a former slave at the Jamaican plantation of the Duke of Buckingham and Chandos who had thereafter worked for Sir Edward for many years before retiring. The elderly Bogle did not immediately recognise the Claimant, whose weight contrasted sharply with Roger&#x27;s remembered slender build; however, Bogle quickly accepted that the Claimant was Roger, and remained convinced until the end of his life. On 2 September 1866 the Claimant, having received funds from England, sailed from Sydney on board the &quot;Rakaia&quot; with his wife and children in first class, and a small retinue including Bogle and his youngest son Henry George in second class. Good living in Sydney had raised his weight on departure to , and during the long voyage he added another . After a journey involving several changes of ship, the party arrived at Tilbury on 25 December 1866.

===Recognition in France===

After depositing his family in a London hotel, the Claimant called at Lady Tichborne&#x27;s address and was told she was in Paris. He then went to Wapping in East London, where he enquired after a local family named Orton. Finding that they had left the area, he identified himself to a neighbour as a friend of Arthur Orton, who, he said, was now one of the wealthiest men in Australia. The significance of the Wapping visit would become apparent only later. On 29 December the Claimant visited Alresford and stayed at the Swan Hotel, where the landlord detected a resemblance to the Tichbornes. The Claimant confided that he was the missing Sir Roger but asked that this be kept secret. He also sought information concerning the Tichborne family.

Back in London, the Claimant employed a solicitor, John Holmes, who agreed to go with him to Paris to meet Lady Tichborne. This meeting took place on 11 January at the Hôtel de Lille. As soon as she saw his face, Lady Tichborne accepted him. At Holmes&#x27;s behest she lodged with the British Embassy a signed declaration formally testifying that the Claimant was her son. She was unmoved when Father Châtillon, Roger&#x27;s childhood tutor, declared the Claimant an impostor, and she allowed Holmes to inform &quot;The Times&quot; in London that she had recognised Roger. She settled an income of £1,000 a year on him, and accompanied him to England to declare her support before the more sceptical members of the Tichborne family.

==Laying the groundwork, 1867–1871==
===Support and opposition===

The Claimant quickly acquired significant supporters; the Tichborne family&#x27;s solicitor Edward Hopkins accepted him, as did J. P. Lipscomb, the family&#x27;s doctor. Lipscomb, after a detailed medical examination, reported that the Claimant possessed a distinctive genital malformation. It would later be suggested that Roger Tichborne had this same defect, but this could not be established beyond speculation and hearsay. Many people were impressed by the Claimant&#x27;s seeming ability to recall small details of Roger Tichborne&#x27;s early life, such as the fly fishing tackle he had used. Several soldiers who had served with Roger in the Dragoons, including his former batman Thomas Carter, recognised the Claimant as Roger. Other notable supporters included Lord Rivers, a landowner and sportsman, and Guildford Onslow, the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Guildford who became one of the Claimant&#x27;s staunchest advocates. Rohan McWilliam, in his account of the case, calls this wide degree of recognition remarkable, particularly given the Claimant&#x27;s increasing physical differences from the slim Roger. By mid-June 1867 the Claimant&#x27;s weight had reached almost and would increase even more in the ensuing years.

Despite Lady Tichborne&#x27;s insistence that the Claimant was her son, the rest of the Tichbornes and their related families were almost unanimous in declaring him a fraud. They recognised Alfred Tichborne&#x27;s infant son, Henry Alfred, as the 12th baronet. Lady Doughty, Sir Edward&#x27;s widow, had initially accepted the evidence from Australia but changed her mind soon after the Claimant&#x27;s arrival in England. Lady Tichborne&#x27;s brother Henry Seymour denounced the Claimant as false when he found that the latter neither spoke nor understood French (Roger&#x27;s first language as a child) and lacked any trace of a French accent. The Claimant was unable to identify several family members and complained about attempts to catch him out by presenting him with impostors. Vincent Gosford, a former Tichborne Park steward, was unimpressed by the Claimant, who, when asked to name the contents of a sealed package that Roger left with Gosford before his departure in 1853, said he could not remember. The family believed that the Claimant had acquired from Bogle and other sources information that enabled him to demonstrate some knowledge of the family&#x27;s affairs, including, for example, the locations of certain pictures in Tichborne Park. Apart from Lady Tichborne, a distant cousin, Anthony John Wright Biddulph, was the only relation who accepted the Claimant as genuine; however, as long as Lady Tichborne was alive and maintaining her support, the Claimant&#x27;s position remained strong.

On 31 July 1867 the Claimant underwent a judicial examination at the Chancery Division of the Royal Courts of Justice. He testified that after his arrival in Melbourne in July 1854 he had worked for William Foster at a cattle station in Gippsland under the name of Thomas Castro. While there, he had met Arthur Orton, a fellow Englishman. After leaving Foster&#x27;s employment the Claimant had subsequently wandered the country, sometimes with Orton, working in various capacities before setting up as a butcher in Wagga Wagga in 1865. On the basis of this information, the Tichborne family sent an agent, John Mackenzie, to Australia to make further enquiries. Mackenzie located Foster&#x27;s widow, who produced the old station records. These showed no reference to &quot;Thomas Castro&quot;, although the employment of an &quot;Arthur Orton&quot; was recorded. Foster&#x27;s widow also identified a photograph of the Claimant as Arthur Orton, thus providing the first direct evidence that the Claimant might in fact be Orton. In Wagga Wagga one local resident recalled the butcher Castro saying that he had learned his trade in Wapping. When this information reached London, enquiries were made in Wapping by a private detective, ex-police inspector Jack Whicher, and the Claimant&#x27;s visit in December 1866 was revealed.

===Arthur Orton===
Arthur Orton, a butcher&#x27;s son born on 20 March 1834 in Wapping, had gone to sea as a boy and had been in Chile in the early 1850s. Sometime in 1852 he arrived in Hobart, Tasmania, in the transport ship &quot;Middleton&quot; and later moved to mainland Australia. His employment by Foster at Gippsland terminated around 1857 with a dispute over wages. Thereafter he disappears; if he was not Castro, there is no further direct evidence of Orton&#x27;s existence, although strenuous efforts were made to find him. The Claimant hinted that some of his activities with Orton were of a criminal nature and that to confound the authorities they had sometimes exchanged names. Most of Orton&#x27;s family failed to recognise the Claimant as their long-lost kinsman, although it was later revealed that he had paid them money. A former sweetheart of Orton&#x27;s, Mary Ann Loder, did identify the Claimant as Orton.

===Financial problems===
Lady Tichborne died on 12 March 1868, thus depriving the Claimant of his principal advocate and his main source of income. He outraged the family by insisting on taking the position of chief mourner at her funeral mass. His lost income was rapidly replaced by a fund, set up by supporters, that provided a house near Alresford and an income of £1,400 a year ().

In September 1868, together with his legal team, the Claimant went to South America to meet face-to-face with potential witnesses in Melipilla who might confirm his identity. He disembarked at Buenos Aires, ostensibly to travel to Valparaíso overland and there rejoin his advisers who were continuing by sea. After waiting two months in Buenos Aires he caught a ship home. His explanations for this sudden retreatpoor health and the dangers from brigandsdid not convince his backers, many of whom withdrew their support; Holmes resigned as his solicitor. Furthermore, on their return his advisers reported that no one in Melipilla had heard of &quot;Tichborne&quot;, although they remembered a young English sailor called &quot;Arturo&quot;.

The Claimant was now bankrupt. In 1870 his new legal advisers launched a novel fundraising scheme: Tichborne Bonds, an issue of 1,000 debentures of £100 face value, the holders of which would be repaid with interest when the Claimant obtained his inheritance. About £40,000 was raised, though the bonds quickly traded at a considerable discount and were soon being exchanged for derisory sums. The scheme allowed the Claimant to continue to meet his living and legal expenses for a while. After a delay while the Franco-Prussian War and its aftermath prevented key witnesses from leaving Paris, the civil case that the Claimant hoped would confirm his identity finally came to court in May 1871.

==Civil case: &quot;Tichborne v. Lushington&quot;, 1871–1872==

The case was listed in the Court of Common Pleas as &quot;Tichborne v. Lushington&quot;, in the form of an action for the ejectment of Colonel Lushington, the tenant of Tichborne Park. The real purpose was to establish the Claimant&#x27;s identity as Sir Roger Tichborne and his rights to the family&#x27;s estates; failure on his part would expose him as an impostor. In addition to Tichborne Park&#x27;s , the estates included manors, lands and farms in Hampshire, and considerable properties in London and elsewhere, which altogether produced an annual income of over £20,000, equivalent to about £ in .

===Evidence and cross-examination===

The hearing, which took place within the Palace of Westminster, began on 11 May 1871 before Sir William Bovill, who was Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. The Claimant&#x27;s legal team was led by William Ballantine and Hardinge Giffard, both highly experienced advocates. Opposing them, acting on instructions from the bulk of the Tichborne family, were John Duke Coleridge, the Solicitor General (he was promoted to Attorney-General during the hearing), and Henry Hawkins, a future High Court judge who was then at the height of his powers as a cross-examiner. In his opening speech, Ballantine made much of Roger Tichborne&#x27;s unhappy childhood, his overbearing father, his poor education and his frequently unwise choices of companions. The Claimant&#x27;s experiences in an open boat following the wreck of the &quot;Bella&quot; had, said Ballantine, impaired his memories of his earlier years, which explained his uncertain recall. Attempts to identify his client as Arthur Orton were, Ballantine argued, the concoctions of &quot;irresponsible&quot; private investigators acting for the Tichborne family.

The first witnesses for the Claimant included former officers and men from Roger Tichborne&#x27;s regiment, all of whom declared their belief that he was genuine. Among servants and former servants of the Tichborne family called by Ballantine was John Moore, Roger&#x27;s valet in South America. He testified that the Claimant had remembered many small details of their months together, including clothing worn and the name of a pet dog the pair had adopted. Roger&#x27;s cousin Anthony Biddulph explained that he had accepted the Claimant only after spending much time in his company.

On 30 May Ballantine called the Claimant to the stand. During his examination-in-chief, the Claimant answered questions on Arthur Orton, whom he described as &quot;a large-boned man with sharp features and a lengthy face slightly marked with smallpox&quot;. He had lost sight of Orton between 1862 and 1865, but they had met again in Wagga Wagga, where the Claimant had discussed his inheritance. Under cross-examination the Claimant was evasive when pressed for further details of his relationship with Orton, saying that he did not wish to incriminate himself. After questioning him on his visit to Wapping, Hawkins asked him directly: &quot;Are you Arthur Orton?&quot; to which he replied &quot;I am not&quot;. The Claimant displayed considerable ignorance when questioned about his time at Stonyhurst. He could not identify Virgil, confused Latin with Greek, and did not understand what chemistry was. He caused a sensation when he declared that he had seduced Katherine Doughty and that the sealed package given to Gosford, the contents of which he earlier claimed not to recall, contained instructions to be followed in the event of her pregnancy. Rohan McWilliam, in his chronicle of the affair, comments that from that point on the Tichborne family were fighting not only for their estates but for Katherine Doughty&#x27;s honour.

===Collapse of the case===
On 7 July the court adjourned for four months. When it resumed, Ballantine called more witnesses, including Bogle and Francis Baigent, a close family friend. Hawkins contended that Bogle and Baigent were feeding the Claimant with information, but in cross-examination he could not dent their belief that the Claimant was genuine. In January 1872 Coleridge began the case for the defence with a speech during which he categorised the Claimant as comparable with &quot;the great impostors of history&quot;. He intended to prove that the Claimant was Arthur Orton. He had over 200 witnesses lined up, but it transpired that few were required. Lord Bellew, who had known Roger Tichborne at Stonyhurst, testified that Roger had distinctive body tattoos which the Claimant did not possess. On 4 March the jury notified the judge that they had heard enough and were ready to reject the Claimant&#x27;s suit. Having ascertained that this decision was based on the evidence as a whole and not solely on the missing tattoos, Bovill ordered the Claimant&#x27;s arrest on charges of perjury and committed him to Newgate Prison.

==Appeal to the public, 1872–1873==

From his cell in Newgate, the Claimant vowed to resume the fight as soon as he was acquitted. On 25 March 1872 he published in the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; an &quot;Appeal to the Public&quot;, requesting financial help to meet his legal and living costs: &quot;I appeal to every British soul who is inspired by a love of justice and fair play, and is willing to defend the weak against the strong&quot;. The Claimant had gained considerable popular support during the civil trial; his fight was perceived by many as symbolising the problems faced by the working class when seeking justice in the courts. In the wake of his appeal, support committees were formed throughout the country. When he was bailed early in April, on sureties provided by Lord Rivers and Guildford Onslow, a large crowd cheered him as he left the Old Bailey.

At a public meeting in Alresford on 14 May, Onslow reported that subscriptions to the defence fund were already pouring in and that invitations to visit and speak had been received from many towns. As the Claimant addressed meetings up and down the country, journalists following the campaign often commented on his pronounced cockney accent, suggestive of East London origins. The campaign drew in some high-level supporters, among whom was George Hammond Whalley, a controversial anti-Catholic who was MP for Peterborough. He and Onslow were sometimes incautious in their speeches; after a meeting in St James&#x27;s Hall, London, on 11 December 1872, each made specific charges against the Attorney General and the Government of trying to pervert the course of justice. They were fined £100 each for contempt of court.

With few exceptions, the mainstream press was hostile to the Claimant&#x27;s campaign. To counteract this, his supporters launched two short-lived newspapers, the &quot;Tichborne Gazette&quot; in May 1872 and the &quot;Tichborne News and Anti-Oppression Journal&quot; in June. The former was wholly devoted to the Claimant&#x27;s cause and ran until Onslow&#x27;s and Whalley&#x27;s contempt convictions in December 1872. The &quot;Tichborne News&quot;, which concerned itself with a broader range of perceived injustices, closed after four months.

==Criminal case: &quot;Regina v. Castro&quot;, 1873–1874==
===Judges and counsel===

The criminal case, to be heard in the Queen&#x27;s Bench, was listed as &quot;Regina v. Castro&quot;, the name Castro being the last uncontested alias of the Claimant. Because of its expected length, the case was scheduled as a trial at bar, a device that allowed a panel rather than one judge to hear it. The president of the panel was Sir Alexander Cockburn, the Lord Chief Justice. His decision to hear this case was controversial, since during the civil case he had publicly denounced the Claimant as a perjurer and a slanderer. Cockburn&#x27;s co-judges were Sir John Mellor and Sir Robert Lush, experienced Queen&#x27;s Bench justices.

The prosecution team was largely that which had opposed the Claimant in the civil case, minus Coleridge. Hawkins led the team, his main assistants being Charles Bowen and James Mathew. The Claimant&#x27;s team was significantly weaker; he would not re-engage Ballantine and his other civil case lawyers declined to act for him again. Others refused the case, possibly because they knew they would have to present evidence concerning the seduction of Katherine Doughty. The Claimant&#x27;s backers eventually engaged Edward Kenealy, an Irish lawyer of acknowledged gifts but known eccentricity. Kenealy had previously featured in several prominent defences, including those of the poisoner William Palmer and the leaders of the 1867 Fenian Rising. He was assisted by undistinguished juniors: Patrick MacMahon, an Irish MP who was frequently absent, and the young and inexperienced Cooper Wyld. Kenealy&#x27;s task was made more difficult when several of his upper-class witnesses refused to appear, perhaps afraid of the ridicule they anticipated from the Crown&#x27;s lawyers. Other important witnesses from the civil case, including Moore, Baigent and Lipscomb, would not give evidence at the criminal trial.

===Trial===

The trial, one of the lengthiest cases heard in an English court, began on 21 April 1873 and lasted until 28 February 1874, occupying 188 court days. The tone was dominated by Kenealy&#x27;s confrontational style; his personal attacks extended not only to witnesses but to the Bench and led to frequent clashes with Cockburn. Under the legal rules that then applied to criminal cases, the Claimant, though present in court, was not allowed to testify. Away from the court he revelled in his celebrity status; the American writer Mark Twain, who was then in London, attended an event at which the Claimant was present and &quot;thought him a rather fine and stately figure&quot;. Twain observed that the company were &quot;educated men, men moving in good society. ... It was &#x27;Sir Roger&#x27;, always &#x27;Sir Roger&#x27; on all hands, no one withheld the title&quot;.

Altogether, Hawkins called 215 witnesses, including numbers from France, Melipilla, Australia and Wapping, who testified either that the Claimant was not Roger Tichborne or that he was Arthur Orton. A handwriting expert swore that the Claimant&#x27;s writing resembled Orton&#x27;s but not Roger Tichborne&#x27;s. The entire story of rescue by the &quot;Osprey&quot; was, Hawkins asserted, a fraud. A ship of that name had arrived in Melbourne in July 1854 but did not correspond to the Claimant&#x27;s description. Furthermore, the Claimant had provided the wrong name for &quot;Osprey&quot;″s captain, and the names he gave for two of &quot;Osprey&quot;″s crew were found to belong to members of the crew of the &quot;Middleton&quot;, the ship which had landed Orton at Hobart. No mention of a rescue had been found in &quot;Osprey&quot;″s log or in the Melbourne harbourmaster&#x27;s records. Giving evidence on the contents of the sealed packet, Gosford revealed that it contained information regarding the disposition of certain properties, but nothing relating to Katherine Doughty&#x27;s seduction or pregnancy.
Kenealy&#x27;s defence was that the Claimant was victim of a conspiracy which encompassed the Catholic Church, the government and the legal establishment. He frequently sought to demolish witnesses&#x27; character, as with Lord Bellew, whose reputation he destroyed by revealing details of the peer&#x27;s adultery. Kenealy&#x27;s own witnesses included Bogle and Biddulph, who remained steadfast, but more sensational testimony came from a sailor called Jean Luie, who claimed that he had been on the &quot;Osprey&quot; during the rescue mission. Luie identified the Claimant as &quot;Mr Rogers&quot;, one of six survivors picked up and taken to Melbourne. On investigation Luie was found to be an impostor, a former prisoner who had been in England at the time of the &quot;Bella&quot;&#x27;s sinking. He was convicted of perjury and sentenced to seven years&#x27; imprisonment.

===Summing-up, verdict and sentence===
After closing addresses from Kenealy and Hawkins, Cockburn began summing-up on 29 January 1874. His speech was prefaced by a severe denunciation of Kenealy&#x27;s conduct, &quot;the longest, severest and best merited rebuke ever administered from the Bench to a member of the bar&quot; according to the trial&#x27;s chronicler John Morse. The tone of the summing-up was partisan, frequently drawing the jury&#x27;s attention to the Claimant&#x27;s &quot;gross and astonishing ignorance&quot; of things he would certainly know if he were Roger Tichborne. Cockburn rejected the Claimant&#x27;s version of the sealed package contents and all imputations against Katherine Doughty&#x27;s honour. Of Cockburn&#x27;s peroration, Morse remarked that &quot;never was a more resolute determination manifested [by a judge] to control the result&quot;. While much of the press applauded Cockburn&#x27;s forthrightness, his summing-up was also criticised as &quot;a Niagara of condemnation&quot; rather than an impartial review.

The jury retired at noon on Saturday 28 February, and returned to the court within 30 minutes. Their verdict declared that the Claimant was not Roger Tichborne, that he had not seduced Katherine Doughty, and that he was indeed Arthur Orton. He was thus convicted of perjury. The jury added a condemnation of Kenealy&#x27;s conduct during the trial. After the judges refused his request to address the court, the Claimant was sentenced to two consecutive terms of seven years&#x27; imprisonment. Kenealy&#x27;s behaviour ended his legal career; he was expelled from the Oxford circuit mess and from Gray&#x27;s Inn, so that he could no longer practise. On 2 December 1874 the Lord Chancellor revoked Kenealy&#x27;s patent as a Queen&#x27;s Counsel.

==Aftermath==
===Popular movement===

The court&#x27;s verdict swelled the popular tide in favour of the Claimant. He and Kenealy were hailed as heroes, the latter as a martyr who had sacrificed his legal career. George Bernard Shaw, writing much later, highlighted the paradox whereby the Claimant was perceived simultaneously as a legitimate baronet and as a working-class man denied his legal rights by a ruling elite. In April 1874 Kenealy launched a political organisation, the &quot;Magna Charta Association&quot;, with a broad agenda that reflected some of the Chartist demands of the 1830s and 1840s. In February 1875 Kenealy fought a parliamentary by-election for Stoke-upon-Trent as &quot;The People&#x27;s Candidate&quot;, and won with a resounding majority. However, he failed to persuade the House of Commons to establish a royal commission into the Tichborne trial, his proposal securing only his own vote and the support of two non-voting tellers, against 433 opposed. Thereafter, within parliament Kenealy became a generally derided figure, and most of his campaigning was conducted elsewhere. In the years of the Tichborne movement&#x27;s popularity a considerable market was created for souvenirs in the form of medallions, china figurines, teacloths and other memorabilia. By 1880 interest in the case had declined, and in the general election of that year Kenealy was heavily defeated. He died of heart failure before polling closed in the election. The Magna Charta Association continued for several more years, with dwindling support; &quot;The Englishman&quot;, the newspaper founded by Kenealy during the trial, closed down in May 1886, and there is no evidence of the Association&#x27;s continuing activities after that date.

===Claimant&#x27;s release and final years===

The Claimant was released on licence on 11 October 1884 after serving 10 years. He was much slimmer; a letter to Onslow dated May 1875 reports a loss of . Throughout his imprisonment he had maintained that he was Roger Tichborne, but on release he disappointed supporters by showing no interest in the Magna Charta Association, instead signing a contract to tour with music halls and circuses. The British public&#x27;s interest in him had largely waned; in 1886 he went to New York but failed to inspire any enthusiasm there and ended up working as a bartender.

He returned in 1887 to England, where, although not officially divorced from Mary Ann Bryant, he married a music hall singer, Lily Enever. In 1895, for a fee of a few hundred pounds, he confessed in &quot;The People&quot; newspaper that he was, after all, Arthur Orton. With the proceeds he opened a small tobacconist&#x27;s shop in Islington; he quickly retracted the confession and insisted again that he was Roger Tichborne. His shop failed, as did other business attempts, and he died destitute, of heart disease, on 1 April 1898. His funeral caused a brief revival of interest; around 5,000 people attended Paddington Cemetery for the burial in an unmarked pauper&#x27;s grave. In what McWilliam calls &quot;an act of extraordinary generosity&quot; the Tichborne family allowed a card bearing the name &quot;Sir Roger Charles Doughty Tichborne&quot; to be placed on the coffin before its interment. The name &quot;Tichborne&quot; was registered in the cemetery&#x27;s records.

===Appraisal===
Commentators have generally accepted the trial jury&#x27;s verdict that the Claimant was Arthur Orton. However, McWilliam cites the monumental study by Douglas Woodruff (1957), in which the author posits that the Claimant could just possibly have been Roger Tichborne. Woodruff&#x27;s principal argument is the sheer improbability that anyone could conceive such an imposture from scratch, at such a distance, and then implement it: &quot;[I]t was carrying effrontery beyond the bounds of sanity if Arthur Orton embarked with a wife and retinue and crossed the world, knowing that they would all be destitute if he did not succeed in convincing a woman he had never met and knew nothing about first-hand, that he was her son&quot;.

In 1876, while the Claimant was serving his prison sentence, interest was briefly raised by the claims of William Cresswell, an inmate of a Sydney lunatic asylum, that he was Arthur Orton. There was circumstantial evidence that indicated some connection with Orton, and the Claimant&#x27;s supporters campaigned to have Cresswell brought to England. Nothing came of this, although the question of Cresswell&#x27;s possible identity remained a matter of dispute for years. In 1884 a Sydney court found the matter undecided, and ruled that the &quot;status quo&quot; should be maintained; Cresswell stayed in the asylum. Shortly before his death in 1904 he was visited by the contemporaneous Lady Tichborne, who found no physical resemblance to any member of the Tichborne family.

Attempts have been made to reconcile some of the troubling uncertainties and contradictions within the case. To explain the degree of facial resemblance (which even Cockburn accepted) of the Claimant to the Tichborne family, Onslow suggested in &quot;The Englishman&quot; that Orton&#x27;s mother, a woman named Mary Kent, was an illegitimate daughter of Sir Henry Tichborne, Roger Tichborne&#x27;s grandfather. An alternative story has Mary Kent being seduced by James Tichborne, making Orton and Roger half-brothers. Other versions have Orton and Roger as companions in crime in Australia, with Orton killing Roger and assuming his identity. The Claimant&#x27;s daughter by Mary Ann Bryant, Teresa Mary Agnes, maintained that her father confessed to her that he had killed Arthur Orton and thus could not disclose details of his Australian years. There is no direct evidence for any of these theories. Teresa continued to proclaim her identity as a Tichborne daughter, and in 1924 was imprisoned for making threats and demands for money to the family.

Woodruff submits that the legal verdicts, although fair given the evidence before the courts, have not fully resolved the &quot;great doubt&quot; that Cockburn admitted hung over the case. Woodruff wrote in 1957: &quot;Probably for ever, now, its key long since lost... a mystery remains&quot;. A 1998 article in &quot;The Catholic Herald&quot; suggested that DNA profiling might resolve the mystery. The enigma has launched numerous retellings of the story in book and film, including the short story &quot;Tom Castro, the Implausible Imposter&quot; from Jorge Luis Borges&#x27;s &quot;Universal History of Infamy&quot;, and David Yates&#x27;s 1998 film &quot;The Tichborne Claimant&quot;. Thus, Woodruff concludes, &quot;the man who lost himself still walks in history, with no other name than that which the common voice of his day accorded him: the Claimant&quot;.

<text>108 Mile Ranch is a residential community of 700 homes situated in the South Cariboo region of British Columbia located in a historic area of ranches and lakes.

Historically, en route to the great Cariboo Gold Rush, a few of the travellers settled here.

In the late 1960, Arthur and Henry Block developed the 108 Ranch into a weekend holiday venue, building a golf course, with a restaurant, coffee shop and pro shop, a hotel and an airport. It grew from an original 25 families to a large scale residential community. 

A feature of the 108 community is its green belt lands. Comprising more than these community parklands include 108 and Sepa Lakes, Walker Valley and many small patches scattered around the ranch.

108 Mile Ranch is about north of 100 Mile House, just off Highway 97. South Cariboo Regional Airport is the regional facility for the South Cariboo. Located on Highway 97, The 108 Heritage Site is a tourist attraction with its growing number of restored buildings, including the largest log barn in Canada. 

==Transportation==

===Airports===
South Cariboo Regional Airport or 108 Mile Ranch Airport (IATA: ZMH, ICAO: CZML) is a registered aerodrome located northwest of the city.

<text>The First American Volunteer Group (AVG) of the Republic of China Air Force, nicknamed the Flying Tigers, was formed to help oppose the Japanese invasion of China. Operating in 1941–1942, it was composed of pilots from the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC), Navy (USN), and Marine Corps (USMC), and was commanded by Claire Lee Chennault. Their Curtiss P-40B Warhawk aircraft, marked with Chinese colors, flew under American control. Recruited under President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s authority before Pearl Harbor, their mission was to bomb Japan and defend the Republic of China, but many delays meant the AVG first flew in combat after the US and Japan declared war.

The group consisted of three fighter squadrons of around 30 aircraft each that trained in Burma before the American entry into World War II to defend the Republic of China against Japanese forces. The AVG were officially members of the Republic of China Air Force. The group had contracts with salaries ranging from $250 a month for a mechanic to $750 for a squadron commander, roughly three times what they had been making in the U.S. forces. While it accepted some civilian volunteers for its headquarters and ground crew, the AVG recruited most of its staff from the U.S. military.

The Flying Tigers began to arrive in China in April 1941. The group first saw combat on 20 December 1941, 12 days after Pearl Harbor. It demonstrated innovative tactical victories when the news in the U.S. was filled with little more than stories of defeat at the hands of the Japanese forces, and achieved such notable success during the lowest period of the war for both the U.S. and the Allied Forces as to give hope to America that it might eventually defeat Japan. AVG pilots earned official credit and received combat bonuses for destroying 296 enemy aircraft, while losing only 14 pilots in combat. The combat records of the AVG still exist and researchers have found them credible. On 4 July 1942 the AVG was disbanded and replaced by the 23rd Fighter Group of the United States Army Air Forces, which was later absorbed into the U.S. Fourteenth Air Force with General Chennault as commander. The 23rd FG went on to achieve similar combat success, while retaining the nose art on the left-over P-40s.

==Origin==
The American Volunteer Group was largely the creation of Claire L. Chennault, a retired U.S. Army Air Corps officer who had worked in China since August 1937, first as military aviation advisor to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in the early months of the Sino-Japanese War, then as director of a Chinese Air Force flight school centered in Kunming. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union supplied fighter and bomber squadrons to China, but these units were mostly withdrawn by the summer of 1940. Chiang then asked for American combat aircraft and pilots, sending Chennault to Washington as an adviser to China&#x27;s ambassador and Chiang&#x27;s brother-in-law, T. V. Soong.

Chennault spent the winter of 1940–1941 in Washington, supervising the purchase of 100 Curtiss P-40 fighters and the recruiting of 100 pilots and some 200 ground crew and administrative personnel that would constitute the 1st AVG. He also laid the groundwork for a follow-on bomber group and a second fighter group, though these would be aborted after the Pearl Harbor attack.

===Original American volunteer group===

Of the pilots, 60 came from the Navy and Marine Corps and 40 from the Army Air Corps. (One army pilot, Albert Baumler was refused a passport because he had earlier flown as a mercenary in Spain, so only 99 actually sailed for Asia. Ten more army flight instructors were hired as check pilots for Chinese cadets, and several of these would ultimately join the AVG&#x27;s combat squadrons.) The volunteers were discharged from the armed services, to be employed for &quot;training and instruction&quot; by a private military contractor, the Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company (CAMCO), which paid them $600 a month for pilot officers, $675 a month for flight leaders, $750 for squadron leaders (no pilot was recruited at this level), and about $250 for skilled ground crewmen. Some pilots were also orally promised a bounty of $500 for each enemy aircraft shot down, and this was later confirmed by Madame Chiang Kai-shek.
The first batch, some 300 men, departed San Francisco on 10 July 1941 and arrived in Rangoon, Burma, on 28 July, on the Dutch ship &quot;Jaegersfontaine&quot;, operated by Java-Pacific Lijn. The second batch, some 30 pilots, departed on 24 September 1941 and arrived on 12 November on the Dutch ship &quot;Boschfontein&quot;. These volunteers used civilian passports on these trips. After arriving in Rangoon, they were initially based at a British airfield in Toungoo for training while their aircraft were assembled and test flown by CAMCO personnel at Mingaladon Airport outside Rangoon. Chennault set up a schoolhouse that was made necessary because many pilots had &quot;lied about their flying experience, claiming pursuit experience when they had flown only bombers and sometimes much less powerful aeroplanes.&quot; They called Chennault &quot;the Old Man&quot; due to his much older age and leathery exterior obtained from years flying open cockpit pursuit aircraft in the Army Air Corps. Most believed that he had flown as a fighter pilot in China, although stories that he was a combat ace are probably apocryphal.

Of the 300 original members of the CAMCO personnel, nine were Chinese-Americans recruited from America&#x27;s Chinatowns. All nine were trained at Allison Engineworks in Indianapolis, Indiana: all were P-40 mechanics. Upon arrival in Kunming, two other Chinese-Americans were hired, a Ford Motor truck specialist and a doctor, raising the total to 11. Prior to 4 July 1942, three of the P-40 mechanics resigned. The official AVG roster lists the original eight.

The AVG was created by an executive order of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. He did not speak English, however, and Chennault never learned to speak Chinese. As a result, all communications between the two men were routed through Soong Mei-ling, &quot;Madame Chiang&quot; as she was known to Americans, and she was designated the group&#x27;s &quot;honorary commander.&quot;

===Chennault fighter doctrine===

Chennault preached a radically different approach to air combat based on his study of Japanese tactics and equipment, his observation of the tactics used by Soviet pilots in China during the undeclared Soviet–Japanese border conflicts in 1939, and his judgment of the strengths and weaknesses of his own aircraft and pilots. The actual average strength of the AVG was never more than 62 combat-ready pilots and fighters. Chennault faced serious obstacles since many AVG pilots were inexperienced and a few quit at the first opportunity. However, he made a virtue out of these disadvantages, shifting unsuitable pilots to staff jobs and always ensuring that he had a squadron or two in reserve. (The AVG had no ranks, so no division between officers and enlisted soldiers existed.)

Chennault and the Flying Tigers benefited from the country&#x27;s warning network, called &quot;the best air-raid warning system in existence&quot;:

When Japanese aircraft attacked, Chennault&#x27;s doctrine called for pilots to take on enemy aircraft in teams from an altitude advantage, since their aircraft were not as maneuverable or as numerous as the Japanese fighters they would encounter. He prohibited his pilots from entering into a turning fight with the nimble Japanese fighters, telling them to execute a diving or slashing attack and to dive away to set up for another attack. This &quot;dive-and-zoom&quot; technique was contrary to what the men had learned in U.S. service as well as what the Royal Air Force (RAF) pilots in Burma had been taught; it had been used successfully, however, by Soviet units serving with the Chinese Air Force.

===Curtiss P-40===


AVG fighter aircraft came from a Curtiss assembly line which had just started producing Tomahawk IIB models for the Royal Air Force in North Africa. The Tomahawk IIB was similar to the U.S. Army&#x27;s P-40C, but there is some evidence that Curtiss actually used leftover components when building the fighters intended for China, making them closer to the older P-40B/Tomahawk IIA specification - for instance the AVG aircraft had fuel tanks with external self-sealing coatings, rather than the more effective internal membranes as fitted to the P-40C/Tomahawk IIB, and the aircraft built for China lacked the later Tomahawk&#x27;s fittings to carry a drop tank and the addition of an armor plate in front of the pilot. The fighters were purchased without &quot;government-furnished equipment&quot; such as reflector gunsights, radios and wing guns; the lack of these items caused continual difficulties for the AVG in Burma and China.

The 100 P-40 aircraft were crated and sent to Burma on third country freighters during spring 1941. At Rangoon, they were unloaded, assembled and test flown by personnel of Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company (CAMCO) before being delivered to the AVG training unit at Toungoo. One crate was dropped into the water and a wing assembly was ruined by salt water immersion, so CAMCO was able to deliver only 99 Tomahawks before war broke out. (Many of those were destroyed in training accidents.) The 100th fuselage was trucked to a CAMCO plant in Loiwing, China, and later made whole with parts from damaged aircraft. Shortages in equipment, with spare parts almost impossible to obtain in Burma (along with the slow introduction of replacement fighter aircraft), were continual impediments, although the AVG did receive 50 replacement P-40E fighters from USAAF stocks toward the end of its combat tour.

AVG fighter aircraft were painted with a large shark face on the front of the aircraft. This was done after pilots saw a photograph of a P-40 of No. 112 Squadron RAF in North Africa, which in turn had adopted the shark face from German pilots of the &quot;Luftwaffe&#x27;s&quot; ZG 76 heavy fighter wing, flying Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighters in Crete. (The AVG nose-art is variously credited to Charles Bond and Erik Shilling.) About the same time, the AVG was dubbed &quot;The Flying Tigers&quot; by its Washington support group, called China Defense Supplies.
The P-40&#x27;s good qualities included pilot armor, self-sealing fuel tanks, sturdy construction, heavy armament, and a higher diving speed than most Japanese aircraft – qualities that Chennault&#x27;s combat tactics were devised to exploit. To gain full advantage, Chennault created an early warning network of spotters that would give his fighters time to take off and climb to a superior altitude before engaging the Japanese.

==Combat history==

The port of Rangoon in Burma and the Burma Road leading from there to China were of crucial importance. Eastern China was under Japanese occupation, so all military supplies for China arrived via the Burma route. By November 1941, when the pilots were trained and most of the P-40s had arrived in Asia, the Flying Tigers were divided into three squadrons: 1st Squadron (&quot;Adam &amp; Eves&quot;); 2nd Squadron (&quot;Panda Bears&quot;) and 3rd Squadron (&quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot;). They were assigned to opposite ends of the Burma Road to protect this vital line of communications. Two squadrons were based at Kunming in China, and a third at Mingaladon Airport near Rangoon. When the United States officially entered the war, the AVG had 82 pilots and 79 aircraft, although not all were combat-ready. Tiger Erik Shilling, part of the third squadron commented: &quot;This was the beginning of the greatest adventure I would ever hope to experience. It wasn&#x27;t until years later that I fully realized the magnitude and significance of this first step, to be a lifelong adventure in the mystic Far East.&quot;

The AVG&#x27;s first combat mission was on 20 December 1941, when aircraft of the 1st and 2nd squadrons intercepted 10 unescorted Kawasaki Ki-48 &quot;Lily&quot; bombers of the 21st &quot;Hikōtai&quot; attacking Kunming. The bombers jettisoned their loads before reaching Kunming. Three of the Japanese bombers were shot down near Kunming and a fourth was damaged so severely that it crashed before returning to its airfield at Hanoi. Later, Chinese intelligence intercepted Japanese communications indicating that only 1 out of the 10 bombers ultimately returned to base. Furthermore, the Japanese discontinued their raids on Kunming while the AVG was based there. One P-40 crash-landed; it was salvaged for parts. This mission was one of the earliest American aerial victories in the Pacific War.

===Defense of Rangoon===
The first squadron had flown up to Kunming to defend the terminus of the Burma Road and saw some combat action on 20 December 1941 while defending Rangoon from Japanese bombers, taking down four of them and disrupting their attack on the Burma Road.

At this time, the focus of Japan&#x27;s offensive efforts in the AVG&#x27;s coverage area was southern Burma. The 3rd Squadron – 18 aircraft strong – defended Rangoon from 23 to 25 December. On 23 December, Mitsubishi Ki-21 &quot;Sally&quot; heavy bombers of the 60th, 62nd and 98th &quot;Sentai&quot;, along with single-engined Mitsubishi Ki-30 &quot;Ann&quot; attack bombers of the 31st &quot;Sentai&quot;, sortied against Rangoon. They were escorted by Nakajima Ki-27 &quot;Nate&quot; fighters of 77th &quot;Sentai&quot;. The Imperial Japanese Army Air Force (JAAF) formation was intercepted by the AVG and RAF Brewster Buffalos of 67 Squadron. Eight Ki-21s were shot down for the loss of three AVG P-40s. The 60th &quot;Sentai&quot; was particularly hard hit – it lost five out of the 15 bombers it had dispatched. Nevertheless, Rangoon and Mingaladon airfield were successfully bombed, with the city suffering more than 1,000 dead. Two Buffalos and two P-40s were destroyed on the ground, and one P-40 crashed when it attempted to land on a bomb-damaged runway.

On 25 December, the JAAF returned, reinforced by Ki-21s of 12th &quot;Sentai&quot; and Nakajima Ki-43 &quot;Hayabusa&quot;s (Oscars) of the 64th &quot;Sentai&quot; (Colonel Tateo Katō&#x27;s Flying Squadron). A total of 63 bombers escorted by 25 fighters were committed. These were intercepted by 14 P-40s of the AVG&#x27;s 3rd Squadron and 15 Buffalos of 67 Squadron. In the two encounters, 35 Japanese bombers and fighters were shot down. The Allies lost two pilots and five P-40s. Mingaladon airfield was once again damaged, and eight Buffalos were destroyed on the ground.

After its losses in the 23–25 December battles, the 3rd Squadron was relieved by the 2nd Squadron &quot;Panda Bears&quot;, which carried out a series of raids on JAAF airbases in Thailand. The Japanese had moved aircraft to Malaya to finish off Singapore, and its remaining aircraft in the area (the 77th, 31st and 62nd &quot;Sentai&quot;) launched fighter sweeps and counter raids on the Allied airfield at Mingaladon.

On 12 January, the Japanese launched their Burma Campaign. Significantly outnumbered, the AVG was gradually reduced through attrition, but often exacted a disproportionate toll of their attackers. On 24 January, six Ki-21s of the 14th Sentai escorted by Ki-27s attacked Mingaladon. All the Ki-21s were shot down by the AVG and RAF defenders. On 28 January, a fighter sweep of 37 Ki-27s was engaged by 16 AVG P-40s and two RAF fighters. Three &quot;Nates&quot; were shot down for the loss of two P-40s. The next day, another sweep of 20 Ki-27s of the 70th &quot;Sentai&quot; was met by 10 Allied fighters (eight P-40s and two Hawker Hurricanes). Four were shot down for the loss of no Allied aircraft.

Despite these minor victories and Chennault&#x27;s reinforcement of the &quot;Panda Bears&quot; with pilots from the &quot;Adam and Eves&quot;, by mid-February, only 10 P-40s were still operational at Mingaladon. Commonwealth troops retreated before the Japanese onslaught, and the AVG was pressed into the ground attack role to support them. One unfortunate result of these missions was a prolonged air attack on a suspected Japanese column on 21 February that turned out to consist of Commonwealth troops. More than 100 Allied people died in this friendly fire incident. On 27 February, after hearing that the RAF was retreating and pulling out its radar equipment, the AVG withdrew to bases in northern Burma.

By 24 January, the Flying Tigers had destroyed 73 Japanese aircraft while losing only five themselves – a notable performance, considering the AVG was outnumbered and faced experienced and fully trained Japanese pilots. The main disadvantage of JAAF fighter pilots of this period was the near-obsolescence of their predominant fighter type in the theater, the Ki-27. Though more maneuverable than the P-40, its armament and performance was inferior. Lightly constructed and armed, it could not withstand frontal attacks nor could it out-dive Allied fighters such as the P-40; if it attempted to, it often came apart in the air. In fact, its cruising speed was less than that of the Ki-21 bombers it was intended to escort.

===Retreat into China===
After Rangoon was lost to the Japanese at the end of February, the AVG relocated to Magwe, a small British airfield more than 300 miles north of Rangoon. Chennault started moving elements of the now reconstituted 3rd Squadron to Magwe as reinforcement to his worn down 1st and 2nd squadrons. Aircraft attrition became so high that at this point, individual squadron distinctions became meaningless, and all three squadrons had elements based there, along with a number of RAF aircraft. In total, the Allies had 38 aircraft, including eight P-40s and 15 Hawker Hurricanes. Opposing them were 271 Japanese aircraft, including 115 fighters. Although the AVG and the RAF scored some successes against the JAAF, Magwe was continuously bombed, including a very heavy raid on 21 March by 151 bombers and fighters. On 23 March with only four aircraft left, the AVG was forced to relocate to Loiwing, just across the Chinese border. The Tigers crossed into China on a rickety suspension bridge over a deep gorge. A few months later, they came back to destroy the bridge so no Japanese soldiers could come across that way into China.

Reinforced by new P-40E &quot;Kittyhawks&quot; and by repaired aircraft from the AVG&#x27;s excellent maintenance group, 12 P-40s were based at Loiwing on 8 April. Despite the long retreats, their losses and incessant air combat, the AVG still retained their abilities. That day, 12 Oscars from the 64th &quot;Sentai&quot; raided the base. In the ensuing series of dogfights, four Ki-43s were downed in exchange for one P-40E destroyed on the ground. During this period, Chinese and American commanders pressured Chennault to order his pilots to undertake so-called &quot;morale missions&quot;. These were overflights and ground attacks intended to raise the morale of hard-pressed Chinese soldiers by showing they were getting air support. The AVG&#x27;s pilots seethed with resentment at these dangerous missions (which some considered useless), a feeling which culminated in the so-called &quot;Pilot&#x27;s Revolt&quot; of mid-April. Chennault suppressed the &quot;revolt&quot; and ordered the ground attack missions to continue. But despite their efforts, the Allied situation in Burma continued to deteriorate. On 29 April the AVG was ordered to evacuate Loiwing and relocate to Baoshan in China.

Like the AVG&#x27;s other bases, Baoshan was repeatedly bombed by the Japanese Army Air Force. Still, the AVG scored against their JAAF tormentors, bringing down four &quot;Nates&quot; of the 11th Sentai on 5 May and two &quot;Anns&quot;. By 4 May, the successful Japanese Burma offensive was winding down, except for mopping up actions. One of these was an attempt by a regiment of the Japanese 56th Division to drive for Kunming, an effort that was stopped by the Chinese army operating with strong air support from the AVG. On 7 May the Japanese Army began building a pontoon bridge across the upper Salween River, which would allow them to move troops and supplies into China and drive towards Kunming. To stem this tide, 2nd Squadron Leader David Lee &quot;Tex&quot; Hill led a flight of four new P-40Es bombing and strafing into the mile deep Salween River Gorge. During the next four days, the AVG pilots flew continuous missions into the gorge, effectively neutralizing the Japanese forces. This prevented a Japanese advance on Kunming and Chongqing; the Japanese never advanced farther than the west bank of the upper Salween. Claire Chennault later wrote of these critical missions, &quot;The American Volunteer Group had staved off China&#x27;s collapse on the Salween.&quot; Despite being on the defensive thereafter, the AVG continued to harass the JAAF with raids on their Vietnamese bases. 

With the Burma campaign over, Chennault redeployed his squadrons to provide air protection for China. The Doolittle Raid had prompted the Japanese to launch an offensive to seize AVG air bases that could be used for attacks on the Japanese homeland. By 1 June, personnel that would form the nucleus of the new USAAF 23rd Fighter Group (the AVG&#x27;s replacement) were beginning to trickle into the theater. Some of the last missions the AVG flew were defending Guilin against raids by JAAF Nates, Lilys, and new Kawasaki Ki-45 Toryu (&quot;Nick&quot;) heavy fighters. The AVG&#x27;s last combat was over Hengyang on the day it was disbanded, 4 July 1942. In this final action, the AVG shot down four Ki-27s with no AVG losses.

==Assessment of the AVG==

The AVG lacked many resources. Despite its location in areas with malaria and cholera, it had only &quot;four doctors, three nurses and a bottle of iodine.&quot; Pilots found the food disgusting, and the slow mail from home and lack of women hurt morale. A squadron had 45 maintenance personnel compared to the normal more than 100, and only one base could perform major repairs. Nonetheless, the AVG was officially credited with 297 enemy aircraft destroyed, including 229 in the air. Fourteen AVG pilots were killed in action, captured, or disappeared on combat missions. Two died of wounds sustained in bombing raids, and six were killed in accidents during the Flying Tigers&#x27; existence as a combat force.

The AVG&#x27;s kill ratio was superior to that of contemporary Allied air groups in Malaya, the Philippines, and elsewhere in the Pacific theater. The AVG&#x27;s success is all the more remarkable since they were outnumbered by Japanese fighters in almost all their engagements. The AVG&#x27;s P-40s were superior to the JAAF&#x27;s Ki-27s, but the group&#x27;s kill ratio against modern Ki-43s was still in its favor. In &quot;Flying Tigers: Claire Chennault and His American Volunteers, 1941–1942&quot;, Daniel Ford attributes the AVG&#x27;s success to morale and group &quot;esprit de corps&quot;. He notes that its pilots were &quot;triple volunteers&quot; who had volunteered for service with the U.S. military, the AVG, and brutal fighting in Burma. The result was a corps of experienced and skilled volunteer pilots who wanted to fight.

During their service with the Nationalist Chinese air force, 33 AVG pilots and three ground crew received the Order of the Cloud and Banner, and many AVG pilots received the Chinese Air Force Medal. Each AVG ace and double ace was awarded the Five Star or Ten Star Wing Medal.

==Members of the AVG==

The military chaplain of the AVG described the background of the volunteers in his memoir, &quot;Most men were escaping from frustrations or disappointments, as perhaps I was. They hoped an unknown future in unknown places would somehow give them a second chance. One of the oldest was a tough former sergeant major about forty-three, irreconcilably divorced. One of the youngest was a boy of nineteen who had enlisted in the army, then got right out again for this junket; he was longing for adventures with lots of shooting, perhaps because he was small for his age. A majority came from the South and West, and Texans were the largest group from any state.&quot;
* Gregory &quot;Pappy&quot; Boyington broke his contract with the AVG in the spring of 1942 and returned to active duty with the U.S. Marine Corps. He went on to command the &quot;Black Sheep&quot; Squadron and was one of two AVG veterans (the other being James H. Howard of the USAAF) to be awarded the Medal of Honor.
* Witold Urbanowicz, a Polish ace who first flew with the Polish Air Force, then with the Royal Air Force during the Battle of Britain.
* David Lee &quot;Tex&quot; Hill later commanded the USAAF 23rd Fighter Group.
* Charles Older earned a law degree postwar, became a California Superior Court judge, and presided at the murder trial of Charles Manson.
* Kenneth Jernstedt was a long-time Oregon legislator and mayor of his home town of Hood River.
* Robert William Prescott, founder of the first scheduled cargo airline in America, named the Flying Tiger Line.
* Allen Bert Christman, who bailed out at Rangoon, was strafed and killed while parachuting to the ground in January 1942, had earlier scripted and drawn the Scorchy Smith and Sandman comic strips.
*Harry R. Bolster had one air-to-air victory with the 2nd Squadron AVG. He returned to the US Army Air Force and was killed flying an experimental Fisher XP-75 at Eglin Field, Florida, October 10, 1944.
* Journalist Joseph Alsop served as Chennault&#x27;s &quot;staff secretary&quot; while the AVG trained at Rangoon; he was interned at Hong Kong on Christmas Day, 1941.
* Nurse Rebecca Chan Chung served under Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Fred P. Manget in Kunming, China. She was recruited by Colonel Dr. Thomas Gentry.

==Legacy==

===Transition to the USAAF===
The success of the AVG led to negotiations in spring 1942 to induct it into the USAAF. Chennault was reinstated as a colonel and immediately promoted to brigadier general commanding U.S. Army air units in China (initially designated China Air Task Force and later the 14th Air Force), while continuing to command the AVG by virtue of his position in the Chinese Air Force. On 4 July 1942, the AVG was replaced by the 23rd Fighter Group. Most AVG pilots refused to remain with the unit as a result of the strong arm tactics by the USAAF general sent to negotiate with them. However, five pilots accepted commissions in China including &quot;Tex&quot; Hill, one of Chennault&#x27;s most loyal devotees, with others remaining for a two-week transition period. (U.S. airmen and the press continued to use the &quot;Flying Tiger&quot; name to refer to USAAF units in China to the end of the war, and the name continues to be applied to certain air force and army aviation squadrons.) Most AVG pilots became transport pilots in China, went back to America into civilian jobs, or rejoined the military services and fought elsewhere in the war.

One of the pilots drawn to the success of the AVG was Robert Lee Scott, Jr. who was flying supplies into Kunming over the Hump from India. He convinced Chennault to loan him a P-40 which he flew to protect the supply route; his aggressiveness led to Chennault&#x27;s recruiting him as commander of the 23rd Fighter Group. Scott brought recognition to his exploits and those of the Flying Tigers with his 1943 bestselling autobiography &quot;God is My Co-Pilot&quot; that was then made by Warner Bros. into a popular film in 1945.

===Tributes and memorials===

There are several museum displays in the United States honoring the Flying Tigers. The National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio, has an extensive display dedicated to the AVG, including an A-2 jacket worn by an AVG pilot in China, a banner presented to the AAF by the Chinese government, and a P-40E. The National Museum of Naval Aviation in Pensacola, Florida also has a Flying Tiger display. The Chennault Aviation Museum in Monroe, Louisiana, has an extensive collection of Flying Tigers and AVG memorabilia. The AVG monument in the National Museum of the United States Air Force Memorial Garden features a marble sculpture of a pagoda crowned with a brass model of a P-40; the monument stands nearly 14 feet tall. The Palm Springs Air Museum has a display of memorabilia inside a mockup of AVG ground facilities, with a P-40N painted in AVG markings. Finally, a memorial to the AVG and 14th AF is located at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, depicting a P-40 in AVG markings with a bronze plaque describing the unit&#x27;s history and Vandenberg&#x27;s role as headquarters for the 14th AF.

There are also several memorials to the AVG in Asia. In Chiang Mai, Thailand, a marble obelisk was dedicated on 11 November 2003, inscribed to Chennault; to Jack Newkirk, who was killed in North Thailand on 24 March 1942; and to Charles Mott and William McGarry, who were shot down and captured in Thailand. In Taiwan, Madame Chiang Kai-Shek requested a statue of Chennault in the New Park of Taipei to commemorate this wartime friend after his death (the statue has since been relocated to Hualian AFB). A Flying Tigers Memorial is located in the village of Zhijiang, Hunan Province, China and there is a museum dedicated exclusively to the Flying Tigers. The building is a steel and marble structure, with wide sweeping steps leading up to a platform with columns holding up the memorial&#x27;s sweeping roof; on its back wall, etched in black marble, are the names of all members of the AVG, 75th Fighter Squadron, and 14th Air Force who died in China. In 2005, the city of Kunming held a ceremony memorializing the history of the Flying Tigers in China, and on 20 December 2012, the Flying Tigers Museum opened in Kunming. The date is the 71st anniversary of the first combat from Kunming of the Flying Tigers. The Memorial Cemetery to Anti-Japanese Aviator Martyrs in Nanjing, China features a wall listing the names of Flying Tiger pilots and other pilots who defended China in World War II, and has several unmarked graves for such American pilots.

The largest private museum in China, Jianchuan Museum Cluster, devotes a wing in its military section to the history of the Flying Tigers, including a tribute wall featuring a thousand porcelain photos of members of the Flying Tigers as well as many historical artifacts from the era.

In March 2015, the Flying Tiger Heritage Park was opened in Guilin in collaboration with the Flying Tiger Historical Organization. The park is built on the site of Yangtang Airfield and includes a museum, aircraft shelters, and relics of a command post located in a cave.

===Monroe legacy===
General Chennault retired to Monroe, Louisiana. The University of Louisiana at Monroe changed its mascots to the &quot;Warhawks&quot; in his honor, and a micro-brewery named Flying Tiger Brewery opened in downtown Monroe in November 2016.

===Flying Tigers wrecks===
The wreckage of a P-40 with CAF serial number &quot;P-8115&quot; is on display in Chiang Mai, Thailand. The aircraft is believed to be that flown by William &quot;Mac&quot; McGarry when he was hit by anti-aircraft fire while flying top cover over Chiang Mai on 24 March 1942. The aircraft crashed into the rain forest in northern Thailand. McGarry was captured and interrogated, and spent most of the war in a Thai prison. Toward the end of the war the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) arranged for the Free Thai Movement to spirit him out of the prison to a PBY Catalina in the Gulf of Thailand. The wreck of his P-40 was discovered in 1991, and consists of the P-40&#x27;s Allison engine, Hamilton Standard propeller and parts of the airframe. Today the wreckage is displayed at the Tango Squadron Wing 41 Museum in Chiang Mai, Thailand.

The wreck of another AVG P-40 is believed to be in Lake Dianchi (Lake Kunming). The fighter is believed to be a P-40E piloted by John Blackburn when it crashed into the lake on a gunnery training flight on 28 April 1942, killing the pilot. His body was recovered from the aircraft, which was submerged in 20 feet of water. In 1997 a U.S.-Chinese group called the Sino-American Aviation Heritage Foundation was formed to locate the aircraft and possibly raise and restore it. In March 1998, they contacted the China Expedition Association about conducting the recovery operation. Over 300 aircraft are believed to have crashed into Lake Dianchi (including a second AVG P-40) so locating the aircraft proved difficult. In 2003, an aircraft believed to be Blackburn&#x27;s was found embedded in nine feet of bottom silt. An effort was made in September 2005 to raise the aircraft, but the recovery was plagued with difficulties and it remains deep under the lake bottom. Since the aircraft was complete and relatively undamaged when John Blackburn&#x27;s body was removed from it in 1942, it is hoped that the aircraft will be in good condition and capable of being restored, possibly to flying condition.

On 6 October 1944, the Flying Tigers engaged a Japanese squadron over southern Hunan and a P-40N was shot down. The local authorities assembled a rescue team to rush to the spot; upon arrival, the team found that the plane had been torn to pieces and the pilot was dead. A group of locals covered the pilot&#x27;s body with a red cloth and carried it to the county township. After a mourning ceremony, he was buried and a gravestone erected for the locals to pay respect on Tomb-Sweeping Day. On 25 May 2005, an American organization seeking to document airmen lost in China during the war was warmly welcomed and helped by the local people. After three days work, the remains of the pilot and his aircraft were recovered and transported to Hawaii. DNA testing later confirmed the pilot as Second Lt. Robert Hoyle Upchurch of North Carolina, USA.

===Recognition by the United States===
Just before their 50th reunion in 1992, the AVG veterans were retroactively recognized as members of the U.S. military services during the seven months the group was in combat against the Japanese. The AVG was then awarded a Presidential Unit Citation for &quot;professionalism, dedication to duty, and extraordinary heroism.&quot; In 1996, the U.S. Air Force awarded the pilots the Distinguished Flying Cross and the ground crew were all awarded the Bronze Star Medal.

===Popular culture===
A number of feature films have referenced the AVG directly or indirectly, the most famous being &quot;Flying Tigers&quot;, a 1942 black-and-white film from Republic, starring John Wayne and John Carroll as fighter pilots. Other wartime films with an AVG angle included &quot;The Sky&#x27;s the Limit&quot; (1943, starring Fred Astaire as a Flying Tiger ace on leave); &quot;Hers to Hold&quot; (1943, with Joseph Cotten); &quot;God is My Co-Pilot&quot;, (1945, with Dennis Morgan as Robert Lee Scott, Raymond Massey as Chennault, and John Ridgely as Tex Hill); and &quot;China&#x27;s Little Devils&quot; (1945).

The recent scholar Li Rong argues that during and after the war Americans perceived the Flying Tigers as &quot;proof of U.S. benevolence and superiority&quot; and &quot;helped many Americans regain confidence and assure their identities as racially and technologically superior people&quot;, a process that took attention away from AVG flyers&#x27; misconduct and minimized Chinese contributions.

The two lead characters of the television series &quot;Tales of the Gold Monkey&quot;, Jake Cutter and Corky, were formerly members of the Flying Tigers, the former a pilot and the latter a mechanic. Several episodes featured flashbacks or characters from their time with the AVG.

Similarly, the Flying Tigers have been the focus of several novels, including &quot;Tonya&quot;, by Pappy Boyington; &quot;Remains&quot;, by Daniel Ford; &quot;Spies in the Garden&quot;, by Bob Bergin, &quot;Tiger Ten&quot; by William D. Blankenship, &quot;Wings of a Flying Tiger&quot; and &quot;Will of a Tiger&quot;, both written by Dr. Iris Yang. &quot;Tiger, Lion, Hawk&quot;, a novel for younger readers, was written by Earle Rice Jr. The &quot;Star Wars&quot; reference book &quot;The Essential Guide to Warfare&quot; features an X-wing starfighter squadron named the &quot;Lightspeed Panthers&quot;. Co-author Paul R. Urquhart confirmed in the book&#x27;s endnotes that the squadron was intended to be a direct reference to the Flying Tigers. &quot;Flying Tigers: Shadows Over China&quot;, a 2017 video game developed and published by Ace Maddox, is based on the Flying Tigers.

The Air Force Falcons football team saluted the Chinese military and the United States Navy and Marine Corps by wearing special Flying Tigers uniforms, including sharktooth designs on the helmets, for two games during the 2016 college football season. The team first wore the uniform for its 10 September game against Georgia State, and again for the Arizona Bowl against South Alabama.

The video game &quot;Starlancer&quot; features the 45th Volunteer Squadron, who after scoring a number of victories is given the name &#x27;Flying Tigers&#x27; due to their similar beginning and fighting style.

<text>Ryanair is an Irish ultra low-cost airline group headquartered in Swords, Dublin, Ireland. The parent company Ryanair Holdings plc includes subsidiaries Ryanair , Malta Air, Buzz, Lauda Europe and Ryanair UK. Ryanair DAC, the oldest airline of the group, was founded in 1984. Ryanair Holdings was established in 1996 as a holding company for Ryanair with the two companies having the same board of directors and executive officers. In 2019, the transition began from the airline Ryanair and its subsidiaries into separate sister airlines under the holding company. Later in 2019, Malta Air joined Ryanair Holdings.

Ryanair has been characterised by its rapid expansion, a result of the deregulation of the aviation industry in Europe in 1997 and the success of its low-cost business model. The group operates more than 500 planes. Its route network serves over 40 countries in Europe, North Africa (Morocco) and the Middle East (Israel, Jordan and Turkey). The primary operational bases are at Dublin, London Stansted and Milan Bergamo airports. Ryanair is Ireland&#x27;s biggest airline and in 2016 became the world&#x27;s largest airline by scheduled international passengers. Almost all the group&#x27;s fleet are Boeing 737s.

The company has at times been criticised for its refusal to issue invoices for the VAT-exempt services it provides (airfares), poor working conditions, heavy use of extra charges, poor customer service, and tendency to intentionally generate controversy in order to gain publicity.

== History ==
Since its establishment in 1984, Ryanair has grown from a small airline, flying the short journey from Waterford to London Gatwick, into Europe&#x27;s largest carrier. There have been over 19,000 people working for the company, most employed and contracted by agencies to fly on Ryanair aircraft.

The airline went public in 1997, and the money raised was used to expand the airline into a pan-European carrier. Revenues have risen from €640 million in 2003 to €4.66 billion in 2010. Similarly, net profits have increased from €48 million to €339 million over the same period.

=== Early years ===
Ryanair was founded in 1984 as &quot;Danren Enterprises&quot; by Christopher Ryan, Liam Lonergan (owner of Irish travel agent Club Travel), and Irish businessman Tony Ryan, founder of Guinness Peat Aviation. The airline was shortly renamed &quot;Ryanair&quot;. It began operations in 1985 flying a 15-seat Embraer Bandeirante turboprop aircraft between Waterford and Gatwick Airport.

The first chief executive was Eugene O&#x27;Neill (1956–2018), who had formerly worked as managing director of Ryan&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; newspaper and as Ryan&#x27;s personal assistant. O&#x27;Neill was talented at marketing but did not focus on costs, and the airline lost money in its early years. Ryan vetoed O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s proposal to take Aer Lingus to the European Commission for breach of competition rules, because at the time Aer Lingus was state-owned and Ryanair depended on the Irish government for its route licences. Ryan sacked O&#x27;Neill in September 1987, who sued for wrongful dismissal.

In 1986, the company added a second route from Dublin to Luton, thus directly competing with the Aer Lingus/British Airways duopoly for the first time. Under partial European Economic Community (EEC) deregulation, airlines could begin new international intra-EEC services as long as one of the two governments approved (the so-called &quot;double-disapproval&quot; regime). The Irish government at the time refused its approval to protect Aer Lingus, but Britain, under Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s deregulating Conservative government, approved the service. With two routes and two aircraft, the fledgling airline carried 82,000 passengers in one year.

In 1986, the directors of Ryanair took an 85% stake in London European Airways. From 1987, this provided a connection with the Luton Ryanair service onward to Amsterdam and Brussels. In 1988, London European operated as Ryanair Europe and later began to operate charter services. That same year, Michael O&#x27;Leary joined the company as chief financial officer. In 1989, a Short Sandringham was operated with Ryanair sponsorship titles but never flew revenue-generating services for the airline.

Due to decreasing profits, the company restructured in 1990, copying the low-fares model of Southwest Airlines, after O&#x27;Leary visited the company. In a 1994 lecture, O&#x27;Leary described the strategy as adopting a simple all-Boeing 737 fleet, pursuing expansion over yield, creating a culture of cost-cutting, and &quot;re-educating&quot; the customer to prefer lower prices to &quot;frills&quot;. The objective of a 30-minute turnaround enabled aircraft to make more flights per day. According to O&#x27;Leary, lower fares attracted new customers to air travel, rather than Ryanair competing directly with other airlines for passengers.

=== 1992–2009 ===


In 1992, the European Union&#x27;s deregulation of the air industry in Europe gave carriers from one EU country the right to operate scheduled services between other EU states and represented a major opportunity for Ryanair. After a successful flotation on the Dublin and the NASDAQ stock exchanges, the airline launched services to Stockholm, Sandefjord Airport, Torp (110 km south of Oslo), Beauvais–Tillé northwest of Paris, and Charleroi near Brussels. In 1998, flush with new capital, the airline placed a massive US$2 bn order for 45 new Boeing 737-800 series aircraft.

In 1994, Michael O&#x27;Leary became the sixth chief executive officer. Ryan clashed with O&#x27;Leary, with Ryan wanting the airline&#x27;s PR stunts to be less aggressive, and O&#x27;Leary suggesting that Ryan should leave the board.

The airline launched its website in 2000, with online booking initially said to be a small and unimportant part of the software supporting the site. Increasingly online booking contributed to the aim of cutting flight prices by selling directly to passengers and excluding the costs imposed by travel agents. Within a year, the website was handling three-quarters of all bookings. By December 2023 the website hit 40M monthly visits.

Ryanair launched a new base of operation in Charleroi Airport in 2001. Later that year, the airline ordered 155 new 737-800 aircraft from Boeing at what was believed to be a substantial discount, to be delivered over eight years from 2002 to 2010. Approximately 100 of these aircraft had been delivered by the end of 2005, although there were slight delays in late 2005 caused by production disruptions arising from a Boeing machinists&#x27; strike.

In April 2003, Ryanair acquired its ailing competitor Buzz from KLM.

During 2004, Michael O&#x27;Leary warned of a &quot;bloodbath&quot; during the winter from which only two or three low-cost airlines would emerge. A loss of €3.3 million in the second quarter of 2004 was the airline&#x27;s first recorded loss for 15 years but the airline soon became profitable again. The enlargement of the European Union on 1 May 2004 opened the way to more new routes for Ryanair.

The rapid addition of new routes and new bases has enabled growth in passenger numbers and made Ryanair among the largest carriers on European routes. In August 2005, the airline claimed to have carried 20% more passengers within Europe than British Airways.

For the six months ending on 30 September 2006, passenger traffic grew by more than a fifth to 22.1 million passengers and revenues rose by a third to €1.256 billion.

On 13 February 2006, Britain&#x27;s Channel 4 broadcast a documentary as part of its &quot;Dispatches&quot; series, &quot;Ryanair caught napping&quot;. The documentary criticised Ryanair&#x27;s training policies, security procedures and aircraft hygiene, and highlighted poor staff morale. Ryanair denied the allegations and claimed that promotional materials, in particular a photograph of a stewardess sleeping, had been faked by &quot;Dispatches&quot;.

On 5 October 2006, Ryanair launched a €1.48 billion (£1 billion; $1.9 billion) bid to buy fellow Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus. On 5 October 2006, Aer Lingus rejected Ryanair&#x27;s takeover bid, saying it undervalued the airline.

Ryanair&#x27;s CEO, Michael O&#x27;Leary, stated in April 2007 that Ryanair planned to launch a new long-haul airline around 2009. The new airline would be separate from Ryanair and operate under different branding. It would offer both low costs with fares starting at €10.00 and a business class service which would be much more expensive, intended to rival airlines like Virgin Atlantic. The new airline would operate from Ryanair&#x27;s existing bases in Europe to approximately six new bases in the United States. The new American bases will not be main bases such as New York&#x27;s JFK airport, but smaller airports located outside major cities. Since the Boeing 787 was sold out of production until at least 2012, and the Airbus A350 XWB will not enter service until 2014, this contributed to a delay in the airline&#x27;s launch. It was said that the name of the new airline would be RyanAtlantic and it would sell tickets through the Ryanair website under an alliance agreement. In February 2010, O&#x27;Leary said the launch would be delayed until 2014, at the earliest, because of the shortage of suitable, cheap aircraft.

In August 2007, the company started charging passengers to check in at the airport, therefore reversing its policy of paying for online check-in. It says that cutting airport check-in reduces overhead costs.

In October 2008, Ryanair withdrew operations from a base in Europe for the first time when it closed its base in Valencia, Spain. Ryanair estimated the closure cost 750 jobs.

On 1 December 2008, Ryanair launched a second takeover bid of Aer Lingus, offering an all-cash offer of €748 million (£619 mils; US$950 million). The offer was a 28% premium on the value of Aer Lingus stock, during the preceding 30 days. Ryanair said, &quot;Aer Lingus, as a small, stand-alone, regional airline, has been marginalised and bypassed, as most other EU flag carriers consolidate.&quot; The two airlines would operate separately. Ryanair stated it would double the Aer Lingus short-haul fleet from 33 to 66 and create 1,000 new jobs. The Aer Lingus board rejected the offer and advised its shareholders to take no action. On 22 January 2009, Ryanair walked away from the Aer Lingus takeover bid after it was rejected by the Irish government on the grounds it undervalued the airline and would harm competition. However, Ryanair retained a stake in Aer Lingus; in October 2010, competition regulators in the UK opened an inquiry, due to concerns that Ryanair&#x27;s stake may lead to a reduction in competition.

In 2009, Ryanair announced that it was in talks with Boeing and Airbus about an order that could include up to 200 aircraft. Even though Ryanair had dealt with Boeing aircraft up to that point, Michael O&#x27;Leary said he would buy Airbus aircraft if it offered a better deal. Airbus Chief Commercial Officer John Leahy denied in February 2009 that any negotiations were taking place.

On 21 February 2009, Ryanair confirmed it was planning to close all check-in desks by the start of 2010. Michael O&#x27;Leary, Ryanair&#x27;s chief executive, said passengers would be able to leave their luggage at a bag drop, but everything else would be done online. This became reality in October 2009.

In June 2009, Ryanair reported its first annual loss, with a loss posted of €169 million for the financial year ending 31 March.

In November 2009, Ryanair announced that negotiations with Boeing had proceeded poorly and that Ryanair was thinking of stopping the negotiations, then putting at 200 aircraft for delivery between 2013 and 2016, and simply returning cash to shareholders. Boeing&#x27;s competitor Airbus was mentioned again as an alternative vendor for Ryanair, but both Michael O&#x27;Leary and Airbus CCO John Leahy dismissed this. In December 2009, Ryanair confirmed that negotiations with Boeing had indeed failed. Plans were to take all 112 aircraft already on order at that point, with the last deliveries occurring in 2012, for a total fleet of over 300. Ryanair confirmed that an agreement had been met on price, but it had failed to agree on conditions, as Ryanair had wanted to carry forward certain conditions from its previous contract.

=== 2010s ===


In April 2010, after a week of flight disruption in Europe caused by the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland, Ryanair decided to end refusals to comply with EU regulations which stated it was obliged to reimburse stranded passengers. In a company statement released on 22 April 2010, Ryanair described the regulations as &#x27;unfair&#x27;. On 29 April 2010, Ryanair cancelled all of its routes from Budapest Liszt Ferenc Airport after talks with the airport&#x27;s management on reducing fees failed. As the airport is the only one serving Budapest, there is no lower-cost airport nearby. In June 2010, Ryanair called for the Irish government to scrap its tourist tax, implying it was destroying tourism in Ireland. In August 2010, Ryanair held a press conference in Plovdiv and announced its first-ever Bulgarian destination connecting Plovdiv with London Stansted. The service was planned to start in November 2010 with two flights weekly. In late 2010, Ryanair began withdrawing all routes from its smallest base, Belfast City, and Shannon due to increased airport fees.

In the last three months of 2010, Ryanair made a loss of €10.3 million, compared with a loss of €10.9 million in the same period the previous year. More than 3,000 flights were cancelled in the quarter. Ryanair blamed the losses on strikes and flight cancellations due to severe weather.

In March 2011, Ryanair opened a new maintenance hangar at Glasgow Prestwick International Airport, making it Ryanair&#x27;s biggest fleet maintenance base. In June 2011, Ryanair and COMAC signed an agreement to cooperate on the development of the C-919, a Boeing 737 competitor.

Ryanair cut capacity by grounding 80 aircraft between November 2011 and April 2012 due to the high cost of fuel and continuing weak economic conditions.

On 19 June 2012, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O&#x27;Leary announced his intention to make an all-cash offer for Aer Lingus. The bid was blocked by the European Commission in 2017, which had also blocked an earlier bid.

According to research in October 2013, Ryanair was the cheapest low-cost airline in Europe in basic price (excluding fees) but was the fourth cheapest when fees were included.

On 25 October 2013, Ryanair announced what it described as a series of &quot;customer service improvements&quot;, to take place over the next six months. These included lower fees for reprinting boarding passes, free changes of minor errors on bookings within 24 hours, and a free second small carry-on bag. Ryanair said it was making the changes as a result of customer feedback.

On 27 January 2014, Ryanair moved into a new €20m, 100,000 sq ft Dublin head office in Airside Business Park, having outgrown its previous office within Dublin Airport. The building was officially opened on Thursday 3 April 2014 by the then Taoiseach Enda Kenny, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan and the Lord Mayor of Dublin Oisin Quinn.

On 8 September 2014, Ryanair agreed to purchase up to 200 Boeing 737 MAX 8s (100 confirmed and 100 options) for over $22 billion.

The airline confirmed plans to open an operating base at Milan Malpensa Airport in December 2015, initially with one aircraft.

On 9 March 2016, Ryanair launched a corporate jet charter service, offering a Boeing 737-700 for corporate or group hire.

In November 2016, Ryanair launched a new package holiday service named Ryanair Holidays. The new service offers flights, accommodation, and transfer packages. The service was launched in Ireland, the United Kingdom and Germany, with other markets to follow. Ryanair partnered with Spain-based tour operator, Logitravel, and accommodation provider, World2Meet, to create Ryanair Holidays.

In April 2017, Ryanair started issuing tickets for connecting flights, meaning if a connection is missed, the customer will be rebooked at no extra cost and compensated according to the EU Flight Compensation Regulation. To begin with, such tickets were only sold for flights with connections at Rome-Fiumicino airport.

In 2017, the company announced plans to add 50 new aircraft to its fleet every year for the next five years, aiming to reach 160 million passengers by the early 2020s, up from 120 million passengers.

Ryanair was subject to widespread criticism after it announced that it would be cancelling between 40 and 50 flights per day (about 2% of total daily flights) during September and October 2017. Flights were cancelled with very little notice, sometimes only hours before departure. Ryanair said that the cancellations aimed &quot;to improve its system-wide punctuality&quot; which had dropped significantly in the first two weeks of September which the airline attributed to &quot;ATC capacity delays and strikes, weather disruptions and the impact of increased holiday allocations to pilots and cabin crew.&quot; In subsequent statements, Ryanair acknowledged that it had &quot;messed up&quot; holiday schedules for pilots, including a change to the calendar year for how vacations were calculated. In late December that year, a survey rated Ryanair and Vueling equally the worst in the world for customer service among short-haul carriers in the &quot;Which?&quot; survey. Ryanair responded, &quot;[t]his survey of 9,000 &quot;Which?&quot; members is unrepresentative and worthless, during a year when Ryanair is the world’s largest international airline (129 m customers) and is also the world’s fastest-growing airline (up to 9 m customers in 2017). We have apologised for the deeply regretted flight cancellations and winter schedule changes, and the disruption they caused to less than 1% of our customers&quot;.

==== Abandonment of the single-airline strategy ====
For over a decade, Ryanair had only operated with its Irish Air Operator&#x27;s Certificate and solely under the Ryanair brand. However, starting in 2018 the airline began introducing additional brands and operating on multiple certificates in different countries.


In 2017, Ryanair announced that it would launch an independent Polish subsidiary in 2018, operating charter flights from Poland to Mediterranean destinations. Aside from turning away from the company&#x27;s policy of only operating on a single Air Operator&#x27;s Certificate, the step also meant that Ryanair would be launching charter flights after having focused only on scheduled operations before. The subsidiary was branded Ryanair Sun and received its Polish Air Operator&#x27;s Certificate in April 2018 and subsequently launched Initially, it had only one former Ryanair Boeing 737-800 and complemented its operation with wet-leased aircraft from its mother company. In late 2018, Ryanair Sun was expanded by transferring all Polish-based Ryanair aircraft to it. The decision was made in the wake of staff costs and unions. As a consequence, Ryanair Sun mainly operated scheduled flights on behalf of its mother company using Ryanair&#x27;s FR flight numbers. Ryanair Sun was rebranded Buzz in 2019.

Also in 2018, Ryanair expanded its portfolio with Austrian-based Laudamotion, later renamed &quot;Lauda&quot;. Laudamotion was the successor of Niki, which had folded as a consequence of the Air Berlin demise. The company was founded by Niki Lauda. Initially, Ryanair purchased a 25-per cent share in Laudamotion to increase the share to 75 per cent pending government approval. The deal was announced in March 2018 ahead of the carrier&#x27;s launch in June 2018. After increasing its share to 75 per cent, Ryanair fully acquired the Austrian airline in December 2018.

Ryanair UK was established in December 2017 in anticipation of Brexit. Its first aircraft, re-registered as G-RUKA, was transferred from Ryanair DAC in 2018, with a second aircraft following in 2019. As of April 2023, Ryanair UK has 13 aircraft.

On 23 August 2018, Ryanair announced a new baggage policy. Under this policy, Priority Boarding allows for a larger and a smaller bag, capped by the capacity on the airplane. The company claimed this reduces turnaround times and simplifies the baggage policy. After this, many other low cost airlines introduced similar policies, for example Wizz Air.

On 28 September 2018, pilots, cabin crew and other staff called for a strike due to the transition from workers being employed on Irish contracts and subject to Irish legislation to their own countries&#x27; labour laws, along with an issue in their pay. Due to the lobbying of the crew and walk-outs of pilots, the airline had to cancel 250 flights, which affected around 40,000 passengers.

In early 2019, due to the transition inside the holdings company, each airline (Ryanair, LaudaMotion, Ryanair Sun and Ryanair UK) got its own CEO and management team. Edward Wilson became the CEO of the airline Ryanair and Michael O&#x27;Leary became the Group CEO.

On 9 June 2019, Ryanair announced, together with the Government of Malta, that it would establish a new airline called Malta Air (not to be confused with Air Malta), to consist of an initial fleet of ten aircraft and assume the 61 flights currently operated by Ryanair from the island. The fleet was registered in Malta while a new repair and maintenance hangar was also set up. Ryanair transferred all its existing Maltese operations to the new airline and its fleet was expected to increase from the six Boeing 737-800 aircraft currently allocated to the Malta market to ten (all to be in Malta Air colours) by mid-2020.

=== 2020s ===
The carrier&#x27;s CEO made comments at the A4E Aviation Summit in Brussels on 3 March 2020. Michael O&#x27;Leary said that he expected people to get &#x27;bored&#x27; of the COVID-19 pandemic and saw a recovery by the summer of 2020. That changed, with Ryanair announcing in a statement that it expected demand to return to 2019 levels by the summer of 2022.

The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on Ryanair. While the CEO, Michael O&#x27;Leary, remained adamant that state aid was not an option, the carrier announced several changes to its operations. This included the loss of 3000 jobs, announced on 1 May 2020, which affected mainly pilots and cabin crew. This came as the airline announced it would suspend the majority of its operations until June 2020. In July 2020, Ryanair&#x27;s CEO, Michael O&#x27;Leary announced that the company had made a net loss of €185 million in the period April–June 2020. In comparison, in the same period of 2019, the firm made a net profit of €243 million. In September 2020, the airline threatened to leave Ireland due to COVID-19 restrictions. Despite their original plan, to fly 60% of the previous year&#x27;s schedule, in October 2020, the company decided to reduce the number of flights between the period of November 2020 – March 2021 to 40%. According to O&#x27;Leary, this was a result of &quot;government mismanagement of EU air travel&quot; as the quarantine travel measures were loosened. By the end of December 2020, the airline reported an 83% drop in annual passengers, from 2019.

==== Handling of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic ====
Starting in late March 2020, in response to flight cancellations due to travel restrictions set by governments due to COVID-19, Ryanair was forced to cancel flights. This resulted in many of their staff being placed on furlough, with pay being cut by up to 50% for some employees placed on the Irish Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS).

The handling of refunds from Ryanair caused a surge in complaints to the Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR), with customers claiming that they have been refused a refund for the flight cancellation. Many organisations have taken a stance against the aviation industry via actions or declarations in the press. The Italian civil aviation authority ENAC threatened a ban of Ryanair due to alleged violation of local COVID-19 regulations.

The Ryanair chief executive Michael O&#x27;Leary said its planes would not fly if the airline was required to leave its middle seats empty to comply with in-flight social distancing rules. He said blocking the space between seats was &quot;idiotic&quot; and would have no beneficial effect.

In December 2020, Ryanair increased its order for Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft by 75, to a total of 210 aircraft, for delivery from early 2021 to December 2024.

Due to the persisting COVID-19 pandemic, Ryanair expected losses of between €800m and €850m in their fiscal year of 2021. Only 27.5 million passengers flew compared to 148.6 million passengers in the previous financial year. The full financial report was released on 17 May 2021. The company reported a record annual loss of $989 million.

====Further expansion====

In May 2023, Ryanair confirmed an order with Boeing to purchase 300 Boeing 737 MAX 10 aircraft, with a total list price of $40 billion (€36.3bn). The deal included 150 firm orders and options for 150 more, for delivery between 2027 and 2033. Half of this order would replace withdrawn 737-800s. The order followed an 18-month public argument with Boeing over pricing, and Ryanair ultimately achieved a lower discount than their previous orders.

While Ryanair had previously returned cash to shareholders via share buybacks and one-off distributions, they announced their first regular dividend in November 2023.

In December 2023, Ryanair briefly became the most valuable airline in the world and the largest airline outside the US. In 2024, they were again the &quot;largest player in the region&quot;.

Ryanair announced a $1.4 billion investment in Morocco for its Summer 2024 schedule, its largest in the country, including over 1,100 weekly flights on 175 routes, with 35 new ones. This expansion features Ryanair&#x27;s introduction of ultra-low fares on 11 domestic routes - a first in Africa, aiming to boost internal connectivity and traffic growth. The plan includes a new base in Tangier with two aircraft and first flights to Beni Mellal and Errachidia. The investment, expected to deliver over 5 million passengers, supports over 500 direct jobs and stimulates economic growth across 12 cities. Ryanair&#x27;s CEO, Eddie Wilson, highlighted the partnership&#x27;s role in enhancing tourism and connectivity with fares from MAD330 each way.

On 14 January 2025, it was reported that Ryanair will be introducing five new routes to Sarajevo. Beginning 31 March 2025, Ryanair will serve additional two routes between Paris and Karlsruhe to Sarajevo. Subsequently, a further three more routes to the Bosnia and Herzegovina capital will be introduced in early April 2025, to Stockholm, Weeze and Girona.

== Corporate affairs ==
=== Business trends ===
The key trends for the Ryanair Group are (as of the financial year ending 31 March):
In 2023, the group had about 6,600 pilots and 13,400 cabin crew, 2,200 employees in administration, IT labs, ground operations and maintenance as well as 125 employees in the management.

=== Head office ===
The head office of Ryanair has been in the Airside Business Park in Swords, County Dublin, Ireland, since 2014. David Daly, a developer, had built the facility before Ryanair&#x27;s 2012 purchase. The building has of space, and the airline paid €11 million to occupy the building. According to John Mulligan of the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, it was thought that Ryanair would refurbish the building for another €9 million. Previously, since 2004, the head office had been on the property of Dublin Airport, in proximity to the Aer Lingus head office. Darley Investments built the facility in 1992. Ryanair later purchased Darley and had a 30-year lease of the head office facility from the Department of Transport of Ireland. The company negotiated to pay no rent for 12 years, then €122,000/year until 2008, then €244,000/year for the remainder of the lease.

== Employment relations ==
=== Conditions ===
Ryanair faced criticism for allegedly forcing pilots to pay tens of thousands of Euros for training, then establishing limited companies in Ireland to have the pilots work for Ryanair through an agency, as well as forcing ground staff in Spain to open bank accounts in Gibraltar in which to receive their wages.

In May 2014, Ryanair&#x27;s office in Marseille was raided by French police investigating complaints that the company was failing to follow French employment law. Ryanair protested about the raid.

In May 2015, the Mayor of Copenhagen announced a boycott of Ryanair. This came in the wake of protests from Danish unions regarding employment conditions. After a court trial confirmed the unions&#x27; right to strike, Ryanair moved its bases out of Denmark.

On 10 August 2018, pilots of Ryanair in Germany, Sweden, Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands walked out for 24 hours, leaving 400 flights cancelled. It is considered to be one of the biggest strikes over pay issues.

On 26 September 2018, Ryanair was forced to cancel 150 flights scheduled for that day, accounting for roughly 6% of its total flights, due to strikes in Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Italy, and Germany. The British Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) urged the company to compensate the 2,400 affected passengers under EU Regulation 261, but Ryanair stated that it would refuse to accept any claims for compensation. In December 2018, the Civil Aviation Authority announced that it would be taking legal action against Ryanair over its refusal to compensate thousands of UK-based customers. In April 2021, the High Court rejected Ryanair&#x27;s claim that it was exempt from awarding compensation because the disruption was due to &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot;. The ruling was upheld by the Court of Appeal in February 2022, though Ryanair may still appeal to the Supreme Court.

=== Refusal to recognise unions ===
In the early years, when Ryanair had a total of 450 employees who each had shares in the company, there was an agreement that staff would not join a labour union on the basis that they would influence how the company was run. The treatment of employees has changed considerably since then and new employees no longer get shares in the company. While Ryanair announced in December 2017 that it would recognise pilots&#x27; unions, the company still refuses to recognise or negotiate with any union for cabin crew.

In 2011, a former Ryanair captain was awarded financial compensation by an employment tribunal in London after being fired for handing out a union form to a cabin crew member while on duty.

In 2012, the Ryanair Pilot Group (RPG) was formed, but to date has not been successful in its aim to represent the pilots flying for Ryanair as a collective bargaining unit.

Thousands of flight cancellations on 15 September 2017 triggered pilots to mobilise, and on 15 December, in Italy, Ireland, and Portugal, O‘Leary recognised unions for the first time, blaming their good timing; he anticipated an uptick in labour costs in 2018, not altering its model. Ryanair discussed union recognition in response to threatened strikes over the Christmas period.

==Customer conditions and service==
=== Ancillary revenue ===
Twenty per cent of Ryanair&#x27;s revenue is generated from ancillary revenue; that is, income from sources other than ticket fares. In 2009, ancillary revenue was at €598 million, compared to total revenue of €2,942 million.

Ryanair has been described by the consumer magazine &quot;Holiday Which?&quot; as being the worst offender for charging for optional extras. As part of the low-cost business model, the airline charges fees, which can be related to alternative services such as using airport check-in facilities instead of the online service fee and paying by credit card. It also charges for extra services like checked-in luggage, and it offers food and drinks for purchase as part of a buy on board programme.

In 2009, Ryanair abolished airport check-in and replaced it with a fast bag drop for those passengers checking in bags. The option of checking in at the airport for €10 has been discontinued, and all passengers are required to check-in online and print their boarding pass. Passengers arriving at the airport without a pre-printed online check-in will have to pay €55/£45 for their boarding pass to be re-issued, while customers unable to check-in luggage online are asked to pay a fee which varies depending on where they are travelling to at the airport (as of June 2012). Ryanair faced criticism over the ambiguous nature of these changes.

==== Surcharges ====
In February 2011, a Ryanair passenger, Miro Garcia, brought a claim against Ryanair for unfair surcharges, claiming that the €40 (£30) surcharge on passengers who failed to print out a boarding card before arrival at the airport was unfair. Judge Barbara Cordoba, sitting in the Commercial Court in Barcelona, held that, under international air travel conventions, Ryanair can neither demand passengers turn up at the airport with their boarding pass, nor charge them €40 (£30) if they do not, and that the fines were abusive because aviation law obliges airlines to issue boarding passes. Judge Cordoba stated: &quot;I declare abusively and, therefore, null, the clause in the contract by which Ryanair obliges the passenger to take a boarding pass to the airport. ... the customary practice over the years has been that the obligation to provide the boarding pass has always fallen on the airline&quot;. The judge ordered a refund for Mr Garcia and said the fact the company was a low-cost carrier did &quot;not allow it to alter its basic contractual obligations&quot;. Ryanair appealed the decision and the Appeals Court in Spain overturned the ruling in November 2011, holding that the surcharge complies with international law.

In December 2011, Ryanair announced that it would fight against the UK Treasury&#x27;s plan to ban what &quot;Which?&quot; magazine called &quot;rip-off&quot; charges made when customers paid by credit card. EU legislation has already been drafted against surcharges for methods of payment.

=== No-frills policy ===
New Ryanair aircraft have been delivered with non-reclining seats, no seat-back pockets, safety cards stuck on the back of the seats, and life jackets stowed overhead rather than under the seat. This allows the airline to save on aircraft costs and enables faster cleaning and security checks during short turnaround times. Ryanair reportedly wanted to order its aircraft without window shades, but the new aircraft do have them, as it is required by the regulations of the Irish Aviation Authority.

Other proposed measures to reduce frills further have included eliminating two toilets to add six more seats, redesigning the aircraft to allow standing passengers travelling in &quot;vertical seats&quot;, charging passengers for using the toilet, charging extra for overweight passengers, and asking passengers to carry their checked-in luggage to the aircraft. While CEO Michael O&#x27;Leary initially claimed that charging passengers for toilets was &quot;going to happen&quot;, he stated days later that it was &quot;technically impossible and legally difficult&quot; but &quot;[made] for interesting and very cheap PR&quot;.

=== Customer service ===
Ryanair has been criticised for many aspects of its customer service. &quot;The Economist&quot; wrote that Ryanair&#x27;s &quot;cavalier treatment of passengers&quot; had given Ryanair &quot;a deserved reputation for nastiness&quot; and that the airline &quot;has become a byword for appalling customer service ... and jeering rudeness towards anyone or anything that gets in its way.&quot; In January 2019, a survey conducted by &quot;Which?&quot; found that the airline was the UK&#x27;s least-liked short-haul airline, for the sixth year running. Ryanair responded by saying that passenger numbers had risen 80% in the previous six years and this was a more accurate reflection of the airline&#x27;s popularity than an &quot;unrepresentative survey of just 8,000 people&quot;. In August 2019, Ryanair came bottom in an annual &quot;Which?&quot; survey rating the customer services of 100 popular UK brands.

In 2002, the High Court of Ireland in Dublin awarded Jane O&#x27;Keefe €67,500 damages and her costs after Ryanair reneged on a free travel prize she was awarded for being the airline&#x27;s 1 millionth passenger.

The airline has come under heavy criticism for its poor treatment of disabled passengers. In 2002, it refused to provide wheelchairs for disabled passengers at London Stansted Airport, greatly angering disabled rights groups. The airline argued that this provision was the responsibility of the airport authority, stating that wheelchairs were provided by 80 of the 84 Ryanair destination airports, at that time. A court ruling in 2004 judged that the responsibility should be shared by the airline and the airport owners; Ryanair responded by adding a surcharge of £0.50 to all its flight prices. In July 2012, a 69-year-old woman, Frances Duff, who has a colostomy, was refused permission to bring her medical kit on board, despite having a letter from her doctor explaining the need for her to carry this with her, and was asked by Ryanair boarding staff to lift her shirt in front of fellow passengers, to prove that she had a colostomy bag. Duff had previously attempted to contact Ryanair on three occasions to inquire about its policy regarding travellers&#x27; colostomy bags, but each time no one answered the phone after half an hour. On 4 April 2011, Ryanair began adding a surcharge of €2 to its flights to cover the costs arising from compliance with EC Regulation 261/2004, which requires it to pay for meals and accommodation for passengers on delayed and cancelled flights.

Ryanair did not offer customers the possibility of contacting it by email or webform, only through a premium rate phone line, by fax or by post; however, it does now have a web form contact option and a live chat. An early day motion in the British Parliament put forward in 2006 criticised Ryanair for this reason and called on the company to provide customers with a means to contact the company by email. Ryanair offers a basic rate telephone number for post-booking enquiries in the United Kingdom, which chose to omit the exemption for passenger transport services when enacting Article 21 of Directive 2011/83/EU on Consumer Rights under Regulation 41 of the &quot;Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Payments) Regulations 2013&quot;.

==== Improved customer service and attracting families ====
On 17 June 2014, Ryanair announced a new campaign to re-invent itself as a more family-friendly airline. Speaking at the company&#x27;s 2014 AGM, chief executive Michael O&#x27;Leary said that the airline needed to &quot;stop unnecessarily pissing people off&quot;. Ryanair said up to 20% of its 81 million customers were travelling as families, and it wanted to raise that figure. Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair&#x27;s chief marketing officer, said: &quot;Families are a big deal for us. It&#x27;s a group of customers that we want to get closer to&quot;. As another step, the company launched LiveChat on its website to improve the quality of service and experience provided by the company. This change in their approach had an almost immediate positive effect on the company&#x27;s finances.

=== Afrikaans language test ===
In June 2022, Ryanair faced severe anger and backlash for making South Africans take a general knowledge test in the Afrikaans language before allowing them to board UK-bound flights as a means to verify that their passports were genuine. South Africa has 11 official languages of which Afrikaans is the 3rd most spoken with a prevalence of 12%. A majority of the population cannot understand Afrikaans and some refuse to speak it on principle, regarding it as the language of oppression during the Apartheid era. Michael O&#x27;Leary subsequently announced that the test was being dropped following outrage in South Africa.

== Publicity ==
=== Sensationalist advertising ===
Ryanair&#x27;s advertising and the antics of Michael O&#x27;Leary, such as deliberately courting controversy to generate free publicity for the airline, have led to several complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) and occasionally court action being taken against the airline.

An example of this was the live BBC News interview on 27 February 2009 when Michael O&#x27;Leary, observing that it was &quot;a quiet news day,&quot; commented that Ryanair was considering charging passengers £1 to use the toilet on its flights. The story subsequently made headlines in the media for several days and drew attention to Ryanair&#x27;s announcement that it was removing check-in desks from airports and replacing them with online check-in. Eight days later O&#x27;Leary eventually admitted that it was a publicity stunt saying &quot;It is not likely to happen, but it makes for interesting and very cheap PR.&quot; The concept of Ryanair charging for even this most essential of customer services was foreseen by the spoof news website &quot;The Mardale Times&quot; some five months previously, in its article &quot;Ryanair announce new &#x27;Pay-Per-Poo&#x27; service.&quot;

Ryanair often uses advertising to make direct comparisons and attack its competitors. One of its advertisements used a picture of the &quot;Manneken Pis&quot;, a famous Belgian statue of a urinating child, with the words: &quot;Pissed off with Sabena&#x27;s high fares? Low fares have arrived in Belgium.&quot; Sabena sued and the court ruled that the advertisements were misleading and offensive. Ryanair was ordered to discontinue the advertisements immediately or face fines. Ryanair was also obliged to publish an apology and publish the court decision on its website. Ryanair used the apologies for further advertising, primarily for further price comparisons.

Another provocative ad campaign headlined &quot;Expensive &quot;BA&quot;stards!&quot; compared Ryanair with British Airways. As with Sabena, British Airways disagreed with the accompanying price comparisons and brought legal action against Ryanair. However, in this case, the High Court sided with Ryanair and threw BA&#x27;s case out, ordering BA to make a payment towards Ryanair&#x27;s court costs. The judge ruled &quot;The complaint amounts to this: that Ryanair exaggerated in suggesting BA is five times more expensive because BA is only three times more expensive.&quot;

In 2007, Ryanair used an advertisement for its new Belfast route which showed Sinn Féin&#x27;s Martin McGuinness (Northern Ireland deputy First Minister and a former senior commander of the IRA) standing alongside party president Gerry Adams with a speech bubble which said &quot;Ryanair fares are so low even the British Army flew home&quot;. Ulster Unionists reacted angrily to the advertisement, while the Advertising Standards Authority said it did not believe the ad would cause widespread offence.

An advertisement depicting a model dressed as a schoolgirl was accompanied by the words &quot;Hottest back to school fares&quot;. Ryanair advertised two Scottish and one UK-wide newspaper. After receiving 13 complaints, the advertisement was widely reported by national newspapers. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) instructed the airline to withdraw the advertisement in the United Kingdom, saying that it &quot;appeared to link teenage girls with sexually provocative behaviour and was irresponsible and likely to cause serious or widespread offence&quot;. Ryanair said that it would &quot;not be withdrawing this ad&quot; and would &quot;not provide the ASA with any of the undertakings they seek&quot;, on the basis that it found it absurd that &quot;a picture of a fully clothed model is now claimed to cause &#x27;serious or widespread offence&#x27; when many of the UK&#x27;s leading daily newspapers regularly run pictures of topless or partially dressed females without causing any serious or widespread offence&quot;.

In late 2020, the airline faced criticism over its &quot;jab and go&quot; advert.

=== Misleading advertising ===
In 2018, Ryanair became the first airline and the only non-coal-power plant to be among the 10 companies with the highest amount of CO2 emissions in the EU. That year, Ryanair had an emission equivalent of 9.9 megatonnes of CO2. Emissions had risen by 49% over five years. Environmentalists criticized the airline harshly and saw it as a sign of the lack of taxation of aviation. In 2020, Ryanair was criticised for releasing misleading advertisements through their claim they were &quot;Europe&#x27;s… Lowest Emissions Airline&quot;, using figures from an airline efficiency rating dating back to 2011.

Although it usually does not serve the primary airports of major European cities, Ryanair has been criticised for placing the names of famous cities on distant secondary airports that were not built for tourist traffic and lacked transit links to the main city. Examples include &quot;Paris Beauvais&quot; ( north-northwest of Paris), &quot;Brussels South&quot; ( to the south of Brussels), &quot;Milan Bergamo&quot; ( from Milan), &quot;Frankfurt Hahn&quot; ( from Frankfurt and actually closer to the cities of Koblenz and Mainz), &quot;Düsseldorf Weeze&quot; ( from Düsseldorf and closer to Arnhem or Essen), &quot;Glasgow Prestwick&quot; ( from Glasgow), &quot;Stockholm Skavsta&quot; ( from Stockholm) and &quot;Barcelona Reus&quot; ( from Barcelona). &quot;Frommers&quot; has dubbed Ryanair the &quot;ultimate bait-and-switch airline&quot; for this deceptive practice.

Ryanair was ordered by the ASA to stop claiming that its flights from London to Brussels were faster than the rail connection Eurostar, because the claim was misleading, due to the required travel times to the airports mentioned. Ryanair stood by its claims, noting that the flight time is shorter than the train trip and that travel time is also required to reach Eurostar&#x27;s stations.

In April 2008, Ryanair faced a probe by the UK Office of Fair Trading, after a string of complaints about its adverts. It was found to have breached advertising rules seven times in two years. ASA&#x27;s director general Christopher Graham commented that formal referrals to the OFT were rare, the last occurring in 2005. He added that the ASA &quot;would prefer to work with advertisers within the self-regulatory system rather than call in a statutory body, but Ryanair&#x27;s approach has left us with no option&quot;. Ryanair countered with the claim that the ASA had &quot;demonstrated a repeated lack of independence, impartiality and fairness&quot;.

In July 2009, Ryanair took several steps to &quot;increase the clarity and transparency of its website and other advertising&quot; after reaching an agreement with the OFT. The airline&#x27;s website now includes a statement that &quot;fares don&#x27;t include optional fees/charges&quot; and they now include a table of fees to make fare comparisons easier.

In July 2010, Ryanair once again found itself in controversy regarding alleged misleading advertising. Ryanair circulated advertisements in two newspapers offering £10 one-way fares to European destinations. Following a complaint from rival carrier EasyJet, the ASA ruled the offer was &quot;likely to mislead&quot;. Ryanair did not comment on the claim but did hit back at EasyJet, claiming it cared about details in this regard but did not itself publicise its on-time statistics. EasyJet denied this.

In April 2011, Ryanair advertised &quot;a place in the sun destinations&quot; but the advert was banned when it was found that some of the destinations experienced sunshine for as little as three hours per day and temperatures between .

In 2016, Ryanair stated that websites such as Opodo and CheapOair and their partners engaged in screenscraping and false advertising, and attempted to prevent them from showing Ryanair data.

In February 2020, the Advertising Standards Authority told Ryanair to provide adequate evidence to support environmental claims after the ASA banned adverts that claimed Ryanair was the lowest emissions airline in Europe for being misleading. Ryanair had claimed in the adverts that they had &quot;the lowest carbon emissions of any major airline&quot; and it was a &quot;low emissions airline&quot; based on Europe&#x27;s top 27 airlines. The ASA queried some figures and the definition of a &quot;major airline&quot; for the purposes of assessing . Complainants said the adverts were misleading and could not be substantiated. In response to the ASA Ryanair cited data from Eurocontrol and airline efficiency rankings from Brighter Plant. However, the ASA said that Ryanair had used an efficiency ranking from 2011 which was &quot;of little value as substantiation for a comparison made in 2019&quot;. The ASA said that customers would interpret the adverts as saying that flying with Ryanair would mean they contributed fewer emissions to the earth atmosphere, which could not be proven. The ASA said that the adverts &quot;ads must not appear again in their current forms&quot; as claims in them could not be substantiated.

== Safety ==
On 26 July 2012, three Ryanair aircraft inbound to Madrid–Barajas Airport diverted to Valencia Airport due to severe thunderstorms in the Madrid area. All three aircraft declared an emergency (Mayday) when the calculated usable fuel on landing at Valencia Airport was less than the final reserve (30 minutes of flight) after having been held in the air for 50 to 69 minutes. The Irish Aviation Authority investigated the incidents and came to several conclusions, including:

# &quot;The aircraft in all three cases departed for Madrid with fuel over Flight Plan requirements&quot;;
# &quot;The Crew diverted to Valencia with fuel more than the minimum diversion fuel depicted on the Flight Plan&quot;;
# &quot;Diverting with fuel close to minimum diversion fuel in the circumstances presented on the evening in question was likely to present challenges for the crew. Initial holding was to the Southwest of Madrid which increased the diversion time to the alternate&quot;;
# &quot;The Crew declared an Emergency by EU-OPS when the calculated usable fuel for landing at Valencia was less than final reserve&quot;;
# &quot;The Met conditions in Madrid were more significant than anticipated by the Crew when reviewing the Met Forecast. Consequently, the additional fuel carried was influenced by the forecast&quot;;
# &quot;Operations into a busy airport such as Madrid in Thunderstorm conditions with the associated traffic levels can add significant delays to all traffic&quot;;
# &quot;Air Traffic Control in Valencia was under significant pressure with the number of diversions arriving in their airspace.&quot;

The Irish Aviation Authority made several recommendations, including that Ryanair should &quot;review [its] fuel policy and consider issuing guidance to Crew concerning fuel when operating into busy airports with mixed aircraft operators and types, particularly in poor weather conditions when diversions are likely.&quot; The IAA also recommended that the Spanish Aviation Safety and Security Agency &quot;review delays into Madrid to consider if additional fuel should be recommended or required to be carried in normal operations, particularly where the southerly Runways are in operation.&quot;

Among the causes of the incident, the Civil Aviation Accident and Incident Investigation Commission concluded that &quot;the company&#x27;s fuel savings policy, though it complies with the minimum legal requirements, tends to minimise the amount of fuel with which its aircraft operate and leaves none for contingencies below the legal minimums. This contributed to the amount of fuel used being improperly planned and to the amount of fuel onboard dropping below the required final fuel reserve.&quot;

In an interview with the Dutch investigative journalism programme KRO Reporter, four anonymous Ryanair pilots claimed they were being pressured to carry as little fuel as possible on board to cut costs. Ryanair and its CEO Michael O&#x27;Leary denied the allegations and sued KRO. On 16 April 2014, the Dutch Court decided that KRO had provided sufficient evidence in two television episodes of &quot;Mayday, Mayday&quot; broadcast in 2012 and 2013 to back the claims in respect of Ryanair&#x27;s fuel policy and &quot;fear culture&quot;. It also found that Ryanair had been given a right to reply in response to the claims. The broadcast of the programmes was found to be in the public interest. Ryanair was ordered to pay the legal costs of the case.

== Competitors ==
Ryanair has several low-cost competitors. Although traditionally a full-service airline, Aer Lingus moved to a low-fares strategy from 2002, leading to a much more intense competition with Ryanair on Irish routes. Ryanair is a member of Airlines for Europe, having formerly been a member of the defunct European Low Fares Airline Association.

Airlines that attempt to compete directly with Ryanair are treated competitively, with Ryanair being accused by some of reducing fares to significantly undercut its competitors. In response to MyTravelLite, which started to compete with Ryanair on Birmingham to Dublin route in 2003, Ryanair set up competing flights on some of MyTravelLite&#x27;s routes until it pulled out. Go was another airline that attempted to offer services from Ryanair&#x27;s base in Dublin to Glasgow and Edinburgh in Scotland. A fierce battle ensued, which ended with Go withdrawing its service from Dublin.

In September 2004, Ryanair&#x27;s biggest competitor, EasyJet, announced routes to Ireland for the first time, beginning with the Cork to London Gatwick route. Until then, EasyJet had never competed directly with Ryanair on its home ground. EasyJet later withdrew its Gatwick-Cork, Gatwick-Shannon, Gatwick-Knock and Luton-Shannon routes.

In 2012, Ryanair also responded to the decision of another low-cost carrier, Wizz Air, that planned to move its flight operations from Warsaw Chopin Airport in Poland to the new low-cost Warsaw Modlin Airport in Nowy Dwór Mazowiecki. Ryanair had previously operated the route to Dublin from Warsaw but withdrew, claiming that the fees at Warsaw&#x27;s main airport were too high. When Wizz Air began operations from Modlin Airport, Ryanair began several new routes from the same airport, most of which were identical to routes offered by Wizz Air.

In 2008, Ryanair asked the Irish High Court to investigate why it had been refused permission to fly from Ireland West Airport to Dublin. This route was won by CityJet, which could not operate the service. The runner-up, Aer Arann, was then allowed to start flights, a move Ryanair criticises as the basis of not initiating an additional tender process was unlawful.

DFDS Seaways cited competition from low-cost air services, especially Ryanair, which now flies to Edinburgh Airport and London Stansted Airport from Göteborg Landvetter Airport, as the reason for scrapping the Newcastle–Gothenburg ferry service in October 2006. It was the only dedicated passenger ferry service between Sweden and the United Kingdom and had been running under various operators since the 19th century.

== Destinations ==

Ryanair&#x27;s largest base is at London-Stansted, followed by its home base at Dublin Airport. Ryanair operates bases across Europe, some parts of the Middle East, and North Africa.

Ryanair traditionally prefers to fly to smaller or secondary airports, such as London Stansted or Paris Beauvais, usually outside major cities to help the company benefit from lower landing fees and quick turn-around times to reduce costs. Ryanair has even referred to Bratislava Airport in Slovakia as &quot;Bratislava Vienna&quot;, despite Vienna being away in another country. In some cases, secondary airports are not distant from the city they serve, and can be closer than the city&#x27;s major airport; this is the case at Rome Ciampino Airport.

Ryanair does still serve several major airports, including Amsterdam Schiphol, Stockholm Arlanda, Athens, Barcelona El Prat, Berlin Brandenburg, Brussels Airport, Bucharest-Otopeni, Budapest, Copenhagen, Dublin, Lisbon, London-Gatwick, Madrid Barajas, Marseille, Oslo-Gardermoen and Rome-Fiumicino. Some of these cities do not have a viable secondary airport that Ryanair could use as an alternative. More recently, Ryanair has grown more at primary airports as it looks to attract more business passengers. In the summer of 2014, the airline opened bases in Athens, Lisbon and the primary airports of Brussels and Rome for the first time.

Ryanair flies in a point to-point model rather than the more traditional airline hub and spoke model where the passengers have to change aircraft in transit at a major airport, usually being able to reach more destinations this way. In April 2017 Ryanair added connecting flights to its portfolio, starting with a new transfer hub in Rome Fiumicino Airport (FCO). Despite it being an Irish airline, it also has a significant presence in France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom as well as many other European countries. Currently, its biggest country market is Italy, with fourteen bases and nine non-base airports.

Ryanair&#x27;s largest competitor is EasyJet which has a far greater focus on larger or primary airports such as Amsterdam and Paris-Charles de Gaulle, heavily targeting business passengers. Ryanair also serves sun and beach destinations with bases in Sicily, the Canary Islands, Cyprus, the Greek Islands, and Malta among others. In August 2014, the airline unveiled ambitious plans to establish a major hub in Israel to service a broad range of European routes. In December 2014 Ryanair announced plans to open its 72nd base in 2015 in the Azores. In February 2018, due to the Scottish Government not abolishing or reducing Air Passenger Duty (APD), Ryanair announced that it would cut many flights out of Glasgow Airport resulting in the airline closing its base there. The only routes out of Glasgow by the end of October were Dublin, Kraków and Wroclaw, with the rest being suspended permanently. This resulted in the loss of 300 members of airport staff. In April 2019, the airline reinstated four of its routes; to Alicante, Brussels, Málaga and Warsaw. In 2022, Ryanair announced that it would close its base at Frankfurt Airport in a row over fees, with the loss of 17 routes. The five aircraft based there are to be based in other locations throughout Europe.

On 14 January 2025, it was reported that Ryanair will be introducing four additional new routes to its destinations; Wroclaw, Cagliari, Valencia and Kaunas beginning June 2025.

=== Choosing destinations ===

When Ryanair negotiates with airport operators, it demands very low landing and handling fees, as well as financial assistance with marketing and promotional campaigns. In subsequent contract renewal negotiations, the airline has been reported to play airports against each other, threatening to withdraw services and deploy the aircraft elsewhere, if the airport does not make further concessions. According to Michael O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s biography, &quot;A Life in Full Flight&quot;, Ryanair&#x27;s growing popularity and also growing bargaining power, with both airports and aircraft manufacturers, has resulted in the airline being less concerned about a market research/demographics approach to route selection to one based more on experimentation. This means it is more likely to fly its aircraft between the lowest-cost airports in anticipation that its presence alone on that route will be sufficient to create a demand which previously may not have existed, either in whole or in part.

In April 2006, a failure to reach an agreement on a new commercial contract resulted in Ryanair announcing that it would withdraw service on the Dublin–Cardiff route at short notice. The airport management rebutted Ryanair&#x27;s assertion that airport charges were unreasonably high, claiming that the Cardiff charges were already below Ryanair&#x27;s average and claimed that Ryanair had recently adopted the same negotiating approach with Cork Airport and London Stansted Airport. In 2009, Ryanair was reported to have adopted &quot;harsh&quot; negotiating with Shannon Airport, threatening to close 75% of its operations there from April 2010. Ryanair was forced to give up its Rome Ciampino–Alghero route, after the route was allocated to Air One, as a public service obligation (PSO) route. The European Commission is investigating the actions of the Italian government in assigning PSO routes and thus restricting competition. In 2016, Ryanair withdrew over half of its flights from Rygge airport in Norway, after which the airport decided to close down totally, as it was privately owned and would make a loss on the low traffic volume.

In order to further decrease airport costs and turnaround times, Ryanair flights often board and deplane from both the front and rear of the aircraft using boarding stairs or built-in airstairs rather than more expensive jet bridges.

In some cases, and more frequently as time has gone on, Ryanair has decided to use large airports where it is not dominant and pay the normal fees. Examples include Barcelona, Oslo, Copenhagen and Manchester, where the carrier increased flights in 2021.

== Fleet ==
=== Current group fleet ===
, the Ryanair Group fleet consists of the following aircraft:
=== Historic fleet ===
Ryanair has operated the following types of aircraft in the past:
=== Fleet development ===


Following the 2019 grounding of all 737 MAX aircraft, Ryanair initially reaffirmed its confidence in the aircraft and indicated that it would be ready to place a new order once it had returned to service; it would seek a reduced price instead of cash compensation. In July that year, it warned that some of its bases would be subject to short-term closures in 2020, due to the shortfall in MAX deliveries, and pointed out that the MAX 200 version it has ordered will require separate certification expected to take a further two months after the MAX returns to service. In the same month, O&#x27;Leary expressed concerns and frustration with the certification delays and revealed that, in parallel with discussions with Boeing regarding a potential order for new aircraft to be delivered from 2023, he was also talking to Airbus which was offering very aggressive pricing.

When Boeing builds an aircraft for Ryanair, it is allocated the customer code AS, which appears in its aircraft designation as an infix, such as 737-8AS.

Ryanair&#x27;s fleet reached 200 aircraft for the first time on 5 September 2009. All aircraft in the Ryanair fleet have been retrofitted with performance-enhancing winglets and the more recent deliveries have them fitted as standard.

The company also owns four Learjet 45 business jets, based at London Stansted Airport and Bergamo Airport but registered in the Isle of Man, which are mainly used for the quick transportation of maintenance personnel and small aircraft parts around the network.

On 13 March 2013, Ryanair signed an order for 175 new Boeing 737-800s. In the press conference announcing the order, Michael O&#x27;Leary said Ryanair was still evaluating the possibility of the Boeing 737 MAX and stated its huge order in March was for the Boeing 737 Next Generation rather than the 737 MAX as it needed aircraft before the 737 MAX would enter service. Ryanair also showed interest in other aircraft, including the Comac C919, when it signed a design agreement with Comac in 2011 to help produce a rival jet to Boeing&#x27;s offerings. At the Paris Airshow in 2013, Michael O&#x27;Leary stated that Comac could build a larger version of the C919 aircraft that would hold up to 200 passengers.

On 30 April 2014, Ryanair confirmed that it had ordered five more aircraft to add to its fleet, four of them to be delivered in 2015 and the last one to be delivered in February 2016, to bring the number of aircraft on order to 180. In the summer of 2014, Ryanair contracted AirExplore to operate some of their summer flights between London Stansted and Dublin airport. On 8 September 2014, Ryanair committed to ordering 100 new Boeing 737 MAX 8s (plus options for an additional 100) for delivery in 2019. On 1 December 2014, the airline finalised its order for up to 200 Boeing 737 MAX 200s, a version of the 737 MAX 8 for low-cost airlines, named after the fact that they can carry 200 passengers. The order includes 100 firm and 100 purchase rights. This makes Ryanair the launch customer of the Boeing 737 MAX 200.

After delays due to the grounding of the 737 MAX, the first Boeing 737 MAX 200 was finally delivered to Ryanair on 16 June 2021. Twelve deliveries were expected for the summer 2021 season (6 for Ryanair and 6 for Malta Air) and a further 50 by summer 2022. In July 2021, it was announced that Ryanair had already handed back all of its leased B737s, which were replaced by incoming B737 MAX 200 aircraft. The carrier expects to sell more of its older aircraft in the future. In November 2022, the company announced it would have 124 Boeing 737 MAX 200 by summer 2023, reducing the number of unfulfilled orders to 86 aircraft. In January 2023, the first Ryanair 737-800 to be retrofitted with split scimitar winglets entered service. The winglets reduce fuel burn by 1.5% and are to be fitted to all existing −800 aircraft in the Ryanair fleet.

On 30 January 2023, Ryanair Holdings CFO Neil Sorahan said that the Airbus A320 leases are extended to 2028.

== Accidents and incidents ==

* On 21 March 2008, Ryanair Flight 1216 while landing in Limoges skidded off the runway. The weather at the time was poor. Emergency slides were deployed and an emergency evacuation announced.
* On 10 November 2008, Ryanair Flight 4102 from Frankfurt–Hahn Airport suffered damage in an emergency landing at Rome–Ciampino Airport after experiencing bird strikes which damaged both engines on the approach. Two crew members and eight passengers were taken to hospital with minor injuries. The port undercarriage of the Boeing 737-800 collapsed, leaving the aircraft stranded on the runway and closing the airport for over 35 hours. As well as damage to the engines and undercarriage, the rear fuselage was damaged. The aircraft involved was damaged beyond repair and was scrapped. The final report of the accident, investigated by ANSV (National Flight Safety Agency) was released on 20 December 2018, more than 10 years later. An English translation was provided by Aviation Accident Database.
* On 23 May 2021, Ryanair Flight 4978 (Athens–Vilnius) was diverted to Minsk National Airport after a false bomb threat was made while the aircraft was south of Vilnius and west of Minsk, but still in Belarusian airspace. According to the airline, its pilots were notified by Belarusian authorities of &quot;a potential security threat on board&quot; and told to land the plane in Minsk. In Minsk, Belarusian journalist and opposition activist Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend were deplaned and arrested. Although the plane was closer to Vilnius, Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko, according to his press service, personally ordered the flight to be redirected to Minsk and sent Belarusian Air Force MiG-29 fighter aircraft to escort it. Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya called for an ICAO investigation of the incident.
* On 3 October 2024, a Ryanair plane (Flight 8826 Brindisi-Turin) caught fire while taxiing for take-off, leading to the passengers being evacuated and Brindisi airport being closed for three hours. Italian lawmakers, who cited multiple incidents involving Ryanair in 2024, demanded an investigation into the company&#x27;s safety practices by the Italian Civil Aviation Authority (ENAC) and a parliamentary hearing with the authority&#x27;s leaders. A similar request was made to the EU Commission by Italian MEPs, who requested an answer as to what action the EU Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) will take.

<doc id="262879" wikidata="Q2963438" url="?curid=262879" title="Chief Buffalo Child Long Lance">
<text>Chief Buffalo Child Long Lance (born Sylvester Clark Long; December 1, 1890 – March 20, 1932) was a mixed race African-American journalist, writer and film actor, believed today to be of Lumbee descent, who, for a time, became internationally prominent as a spokesman for Native American causes. He published an autobiography, purportedly based on his experience as the son of a Blackfoot chief. He was the first presumed Native American admitted to the Explorers Club in New York City.

It has been traditionally speculated whether Long was of any indigenous ancestry; he claimed to be of mixed Cherokee, white and black heritage, at a time when Southern society imposed strict binary divisions of heritage in a racially-segregated society. After his tribal claims were unable to be verified and the truth about his African-American heritage came out, he was dropped by these same social circles to which he had gained entry. Today, the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina and other scholars generally consider Long to have been of Lumbee descent, an indigenous population known for its tri-racial heritage. During Long&#x27;s lifetime, the Lumbee people were referred to by various names by the North Carolina General Assembly, including the &quot;Cherokee Indians of Robeson County.&quot; This name lasted until 1956, when the population was formally redesignated by Congress as Lumbee.

==Early life and education==
Long had ambitions that were larger than what he saw of his future in Winston, where his father Joseph S. Long was a janitor in the school system. In that segregated society, African Americans had limited opportunities. Long first left North Carolina to portray Indian characters in a &quot;Wild West Show&quot;. During this time he continued to build upon his (later proven to be fraudulent) stories of being Cherokee.

In 1909, Long claimed to be half Cherokee when he applied to the Carlisle Indian Industrial School and was accepted. He also lied about his age to gain admission. He graduated in 1912 at the top of his class, which included prominent Native Americans such as Jim Thorpe and Robert Geronimo, a son of the famous Apache warrior.

Long entered the St. John&#x27;s and Manlius Military academies in Manlius, New York with a full musical scholarship, based on his performance at the Carlisle School.

==Career==
Long went to Canada as an acting sergeant in 1919, requesting discharge at Calgary, Alberta. He worked as a journalist for the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot;. Canada had &quot;de facto&quot; segregation and a climate in which the government had discouraged black immigration from the US. During this time in both Canada and the US it was common for those of African heritage to instead make false claims of Cherokee or Blackfoot. &quot;It is not surprising that in such a climate...Long Lance felt that he was safer, and that he could go further, by disavowing any connection, cultural or racial, to blackness.&quot;

Long presented himself as a Cherokee from Oklahoma and claimed he was a West Point graduate with the &quot;Croix de Guerre&quot; earned in World War I. For the next three years as a reporter, he covered Indian issues. He criticized government treatment of Indians and openly criticized Canada&#x27;s &quot;Indian Act&quot;, especially their attempts at re-education and prohibiting the practice of tribal rituals. To a friend, Long justified his decision to assume a Blackfoot Indian identity by saying it would help him be a more effective advocate, that he had not lived with his own people since he was sixteen, and now knew more about the Indians of Western Canada. In 1924, Long Lance became a press representative for the Canadian Pacific Railway.

Through these years, Long also entered the civic life of the city, by joining the local Elks Lodge and the militia, and coaching football for the Calgary Canucks. Due to Jim Crow laws, these activities would not have been possible had he honestly presented himself as a black man. He was a successful writer, publishing articles in national magazines, reaching a wide and diverse audience through &quot;Macleans&quot; and &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;. By the time he wrote his autobiography in Alberta in 1927, Long claimed to be a full-blooded Blackfoot Indian.

==Autobiography and fame==
Cosmopolitan Book Company commissioned Long&#x27;s autobiography as a boy&#x27;s adventure book on Indians. It published &quot;Long Lance&quot; in 1928, to quick success. In it, Long claimed to have been born a Blackfoot, son of a chief, in Montana&#x27;s Sweetgrass Hills. He also said that he had been wounded eight times in the Great War and been promoted to the rank of captain.

The popular success of his book and the international press made him a major celebrity. The book became an international bestseller and was praised by literary critics and anthropologists. Long had already been writing and lecturing on the life of Plains Indians. His celebrity gave him more venues and caused him to be taken up as part of the New York party life. More significantly, he was then admitted to the prominent Explorers&#x27; Club in New York. The Explorers&#x27; Club believed they were admitting their &quot;first Indian&quot;.

He received an average price of $100 for his speeches, a good price in those years. He endorsed a sport shoe for the B.F. Goodrich Company. A film magazine, &quot;Screenland&quot;, said, &quot;Long Lance, one of the few real one-hundred-percent Americans, has had New York right in his pocket.&quot;

==Indigeneity==
The Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina and other scholars generally consider Long to have been of Lumbee descent, and not Blackfoot as he had claimed. In 1929, Long entered the film world, starring as the lead protagonist of the 1930 silent film &quot;The Silent Enemy&quot;, a drama focusing on a famine and power struggle in a post-classical Ojibwe tribe. The film employed over 200 indigenous persons, including actors Chief Yellow Robe, Cheeka, Chief Awakanush, and Molly Spotted Elk, and strived to be an accurate representation of Native American history. Chief Yellow Robe, the central actor who portrayed the Chief and who likely served as a cultural advisor of the film, became suspicious of Long and alerted the studio legal advisor. Long could not explain his heritage to their satisfaction, and rumors began to circulate. An investigation revealed that his father had not been a Blackfoot chief, but a school janitor in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Some neighbors from his home town testified that they thought his background may have included African ancestry, which meant by Southern racial standards, he was black. However, the Lumbee are triracial. Although the studio did not publicize its investigation, the accusations led many of his socialite acquaintances to abandon Long. Author Irvin S. Cobb, a native of Kentucky active in New York, is said to have lamented, &quot;We&#x27;re so ashamed! We entertained a nigger!&quot; 

In his &quot;Being and Becoming Indian: Biographical Studies of North American Frontiers&quot;, late 20th century historian James A. Clifton called Long &quot;a sham&quot; who &quot;assumed the identity of an Indian&quot;, &quot;an adopted ethnic identity pure and simple.&quot; In her book &quot;Real Indians: Identity and the Survival of Native Americans&quot; (2003), Eva Marie Garroutte uses the controversy over Long&#x27;s identity to introduce questions surrounding contested Indian identity and authenticity in United States culture.

==Death==

After the controversy surrounding his identity, California socialite Anita Baldwin took Long as a bodyguard on her trip to Europe. Because of his behavior, Baldwin abandoned him in New York. For a time, he fell in love with dancer Elisabeth Clapp but refused to marry her. In 1931, he returned to Baldwin. In 1932, Long was found dead in Baldwin&#x27;s home in Los Angeles, California from a gunshot. His death was ruled a suicide.

Long left his assets to St. Paul&#x27;s Indian Residential School in Southern Alberta. Most of his papers were willed to his friend, Canon S.H. Middleton. They were acquired, along with the Middleton papers, by J. Zeiffle, a dealer who sold the papers to the Glenbow Museum in Calgary, Alberta, Canada in 1968.

<doc id="262880" wikidata="Q7599525" url="?curid=262880" title="Stanley Clifford Weyman">
<text>Stanley Clifford Weyman (November 25, 1890 – August 27, 1960), was an American multiple impostor who impersonated public officials, including the United States Secretary of State and various military officers.

Weyman was born as Stephen Jacob Weinberg on November 25, 1890, in Brooklyn, New York. His parents could not afford college tuition. He worked mainly in nondescript jobs but on occasion pretended to become somebody higher on the social ladder.

In 1910, Weyman&#x27;s first imposture was as U.S. consul representative to Morocco. He dined in the finest restaurants in New York City, but was eventually arrested for fraud.

Next Weyman took on roles as a military attaché from Serbia and a U.S. Navy lieutenant, with each identity using the other as a reference. He was soon caught.

Weyman was released the second time in 1915. He then became Lieutenant Commander Ethan Allen Weinberg, Consul General for Romania. He inspected the USS &quot;Wyoming&quot; and invited everyone to dinner at the Astor Hotel. The advance publicity alerted the Bureau of Investigation and federal agents arrested him at the party. He was heard to complain that they should have waited until dessert. He got a year in jail.

In 1917, he took on the mantle of Royal St. Cyr, a lieutenant in the British Army Air Corps. He was arrested when he was on an inspection tour of the Brooklyn Armory after a suspicious military tailor alerted the police.

Weyman was paroled in 1920. Shortly afterwards he forged credentials to become a company doctor in Lima, Peru. There he threw lavish parties until his credit ran out and he was arrested.

In 1921 he noticed Princess Fatima of Afghanistan, who was visiting the United States and was trying to get official recognition. The U.S. State Department mainly ignored her. Weyman visited her as a State Department Naval Liaison Officer, apologized for the oversight and promised to arrange an appointment with the President. He managed to convince the princess to give him 10,000 dollars for &quot;presents&quot; to State Department officials. He used the money for a private railway carriage to Washington, D.C., and an opulent hotel room in the Willard Hotel for the princess and her entourage.

Weyman proceeded to visit the State Department, dropped names of prominent senators and succeeded in getting appointments for the princess, first with Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes, and, on July 26, 1921, with President Warren G. Harding. Weyman&#x27;s minor mistakes in protocol aroused some suspicion, but after the press published pictures showing him alongside dignitaries he was indicted for impersonating a naval officer and sentenced to two years in jail.

On another occasion, the &quot;Evening Graphic&quot; hired Weyman to get an interview with the visiting Queen Marie of Romania. He gained admittance as the Secretary of State and the paper got its interview.

In 1926 Weyman appeared at Rudolph Valentino&#x27;s funeral and attached himself to Valentino&#x27;s grieving lover Pola Negri as a personal physician. He issued regular press releases on her condition and established a faith-healing clinic in Valentino&#x27;s house. Pola Negri did not condemn him after he was exposed.

During World War II Weyman was sentenced to seven years in prison for offering advice to draft dodgers on how to feign various medical conditions.

In 1948 Weyman made up credentials to become a journalist at the United Nations in Lake Success, New York. He got acquainted with the delegates Warren Austin and Andrei Gromyko. His comeuppance came when the Thai delegation invited him to become their press officer with full diplomatic accreditation. Weyman contacted the State Department and asked whether it would affect his U.S. citizenship, thus drawing attention to himself.

In 1954 Weyman tried to get a home improvement loan of 5,000 dollars for a house that did not exist. He failed to convince the judge that he was insane.

In August 1960, Weyman was fatally shot when he tried to stop a robbery at a hotel in New York City where he was working as a night porter. The investigating detective said: &quot;I&#x27;ve known about the man&#x27;s past record for years. He did a lot of things in the course of his life, but what he did this time was brave.&quot;

<text>Seyval blanc (; or Seyve-Villard hybrid number 5276) is a hybrid wine grape variety used to make white wines. Its vines ripen early, are productive and are suited to fairly cool climates. Seyval blanc is grown mainly in England, the United States East Coast (specifically the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York, Lake Erie AVA in Pennsylvania, regions in Ohio and Virginia), in the Pacific Northwest (Oregon), as well as to a lesser extent in Canada. Seyval blanc was created either by Bertille Seyve, or his son-in-law Villard, as a cross of Seibel 5656 and Rayon d&#x27;Or (Seibel 4986), and was used to create the hybrid grape St. Pepin. Seyve and Villard used the same Rayon d&#x27;Or x Seibel 5656 crossing to produce the red wine grape Seyval noir.

Since it contains some non-&quot;vinifera&quot; genes, Seyval blanc is outlawed by the EU authorities for quality wine production, which was an issue of conflict with the English wine industry.

==Wine styles==
Seyval blanc has a characteristic citrus element in the aroma and taste, as well as a minerality that may be compared to white Burgundy. It is often oaked and subjected to a stage of malolactic fermentation.

==Synonyms==
Seyval blanc is known under the synonyms Seival, Seyval, Seyve Villard 5-276, Seyve Villard 5276, and SV 5276.

<text>Albert Seibel (1844–1936) was a French physician and viticulturist who made hybrid crosses of European wine grapes (&quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;) with native North American grapes. His crosses are known as Seibel grapes.

==Biography==
Seibel was born in Aubenas in Ardèche department in Southern France in 1844. In 1895, he founded a school to teach grafting methods. He died in 1936.

==Breeding programme==

In the 1860s the Phylloxera plague cut European wine production by more than two-thirds. As the pest originated in the New World, crossing American stock with European &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; varieties was one of the promising attempts to contain the disaster. The vines produced by this hybridization did not necessarily produce better wines, but did produce vine stock that could better survive Phylloxera attacks.

Seibel and his company produced over 16,000 new hybrids, with nearly 500 varieties that were then grown commercially. He often used as a female parent the hybrid Jaeger 70, a cross between &quot;Vitis lincecumii&quot; and &quot;Vitis rupestris&quot; produced by Hermann Jaeger. Some of the most famous Seibel grapes are Aurore (Seibel 5279), Chancellor (Seibel 7053), Chelois (Seibel 10878), De Chaunac (Seibel 9549).

His grapes were widely planted in France and Brazil. However, other than in countries such as Canada and the United States, Seibel grapes have fallen from favour in recent years due partly to restrictions in European law.

<text>Erding (, ) is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Landshut, Mühldorf, Ebersberg, Munich and Freising.

==History==
The region is one of the oldest parts of Bavaria. Erding was located on the way between two important centres of power in the Wittelsbach state, Munich and Landshut. About 1230, a castle was built on the river Sempt in order to secure the road. This castle grew to become the town of Erding.

The district of Erding was founded in 1946. Slight modifications took place in the administrative reform of 1971, when some villages from neighbouring districts were awarded to Erding.

==Geography==
The district covers agriculturally used areas northeast of Munich. Several affluents of the Isar River cross the district from south to north, among them the Sempt. In the northwest there is the Erdinger Moos, which was once a large fen. A substantial part of this swampy area was drained in order to build the new airport of Munich, which opened in 1992.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* the white and blue lozengy pattern of Bavaria
* the horse from the arms of the county of Haag

<doc id="262889" wikidata="Q1586047" url="?curid=262889" title="Vignoles (grape)">
<text>Vignoles is a complex hybrid wine grape variety presumed to have been developed by French grape breeder J.F. Ravat. It was originally named Ravat 51. According to Ravat, &quot;Ravat 51&quot; was the result of a cross made in 1930 using the complex hybrid wine grape Seibel 6905 (also known as Le Subereux) and a clone of Pinot Noir known as Pinot de corton. Despite its French-sounding name, the Vignoles grape is mostly grown in North America. Originally named &quot;Vignoles&quot; by the Finger Lakes Wine Growers Association in 1970, genetic testing has recently proved that Vignoles does not share any major genetic markers in common with Seibel 6905 or Pinot Noir. Thus, Vignoles is unrelated to the &quot;Ravat 51&quot; grapevine that was imported into the US in 1949 and the parentage of Vignoles is currently unknown.

Viticulturally, Vignoles is described as moderately vigorous with moderate yields, late season bud break, an upright and open growth habit, small very compact bunches that are highly susceptible to Botrytis bunch rot, an average of 105 days from bloom to harvest, high sugar with high acid at maturity, average overall disease resistance, and moderate winter hardiness ().

Enologically, Vignoles is often prized for its ability to produce balanced and fruity late-harvest style sweet white wines, including ice wine, although Vignoles is also used to produce fruity dry and off-dry white wines as well.

In the United States, Vignoles is most commonly grown in New York state&#x27;s Finger Lakes region, and in the Midwest including Missouri, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, Iowa and Kentucky.

<text>Seibel grapes are a group of wine grape varieties which originated with the work of French viticulturist Albert Seibel crossing European wine grape with American grape species to increase disease resistance. They were planted widely in France during the 1950s but have seen decline in recent years because French wine law prohibits hybrid grapes in appellation wine. The grapes are still commonly used as blending grapes in table wine and mass commercial wines. New Zealand, England, and Canada also have plantings of Seibel grapes.

Almost all of Albert Seibel&#x27;s hybrid grapes were descended from only four parent grapes: two European grapes (&quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;), Aramon and Alicante Bouschet; one wild American grape, Jaeger 70 (&quot;Vitis rupestris&quot; x &quot;Vitis lincecumii&quot;); and one rootstock, AxR1, which was created by crossing Aramon with a wild American &quot;V. rupestris&quot;. Although Seibel bred tens of thousands of grapes, he did so almost entirely by crossing and re-crossing his original varieties, all of which were descended from the original four vines, so the basic gene pool of his collection remained largely unchanged.

Almost all later grapevine hybridizers, such as Bertille Seyve and his father-in-law Victor Villard, would simply breed one or two of Albert Seibel&#x27;s grapes together and name their creations after themselves, such as Seyve-Villard 5276 (&quot;Seyval Blanc&quot;).

<text>The Alexander Mosaic,&quot; also known as the Battle of Issus Mosaic&quot;, is a Roman floor mosaic originally from the House of the Faun in Pompeii, Italy.

It is typically dated between and BC 100 and depicts a battle between the armies of Alexander the Great and Darius III of Persia. This work of art is a combination of different artistic traditions such as Italic, Hellenistic, and Roman. The mosaic is considered Roman based on the broader context of its time and location in relation to the later Roman Republic. The original is preserved in the National Archaeological Museum, Naples. The mosaic is believed to be a copy of a late 4th or early 3rd-century BC Hellenistic painting, perhaps by Philoxenus of Eretria or Apelles.

==Subject==

The mosaic represents a battle in which Alexander of Macedonia charges the Persian king Darius III, the commander-in-chief of the Persian army. Alexander fought Darius III in a series of battles over control of the Persian Empire. Alexander defeated Darius at the Battle of Issus and again two years later at the Battle of Gaugamela. The work is traditionally believed to show the Battle of Issus.

The battle scene comprises over 50 men. It stands out among ancient works of art because it represents a large group of soldiers, depicts each figure with meticulous attention to detail, expertly captures the expressions that appear on the warriors&#x27; faces, and uses muted colors. The mosaic features many figures in a very large space. The two most distinguished and recognizable figures are Alexander and Darius III. 
On the left side of the picture, Alexander of Macedonia is seen without a helmet, in a profile view facing right. He is posed in action with his lance in his right arm. An enemy cavalryman grips its shaft below its sharp head as his mount tumbles to the ground. Alexander wears a linen breastplate, or &quot;linothorax&quot;, with the head of Medusa, the traditional emblem of Athena, and he rides his horse Bucephalus. He is shown with a lot of curly soft-textured hair. Alexander&#x27;s gaze is trained on Darius. 

Darius III is reaching out to the dying soldier, while another soldier tries to get the king&#x27;s chariot out of the battle scene. At this precise moment, Darius is making the order, because the Persian spears are still pointed in the direction of the Greeks, and the king is riding in a chariot being wheeled around. Darius and his charioteer take up a large portion of the right half of the mosaic. There are various precarious elements surrounding him. In the background Darius&#x27; charioteer whips the horses to flee from the battle scene. There is visible fear and anxiety in the Persian king&#x27;s face, seen especially in his furrowed brows and deep frown. Darius is positioned holding a bow in his left hand while his right arm is outstretched towards Alexander. Darius&#x27; brother Oxyathres is also portrayed, sacrificing himself to save the King. Directly in front of the king&#x27;s chariot is a soldier holding the reins to his horse. The horse is a large figure that draws much attention because of its backward facing positioning. The horse&#x27;s hindquarters are facing the audience with a raised tail.
Radical foreshortening—as in the central horse, seen from behind—and the use of shading to convey a sense of mass and volume enhance the naturalistic effect of the scene. Repeated diagonal spears, clashing metal, and the crowding of men and horses evoke the din of battle. At the same time, action is arrested by dramatic details such as the fallen horse and the Persian soldier in the foreground who watches his own death throes reflected in a shield.

==History of the mosaic==

===Production===
The mosaic is made of about one and a half million tiny colored tiles called tesserae, arranged in gradual curves called &quot;opus vermiculatum&quot; (also known as &quot;worm work&quot;, because they seem to replicate the slow motion of a crawling worm) rather than &quot;opus signinum&quot; or other forms of stone chips put in mortar. These tesserae are about wide, and it is estimated that over four million pieces were used in the mosaic. 

The color scale of Roman mosaics are extremely rich in gradation. The process of gathering materials for mosaics was a complex undertaking since the color scale was based solely on the pieces of marble that could be found in nature. Following the style of many other Hellenistic artists, the entire mosaic is composed of reds, yellows, black, and white. The mosaic is an unusually detailed work for a private residence and was likely commissioned by a wealthy person or family. There is evidence that the mosaic was imported from the East, as there are places where some details are distorted and changed. Some scholars argue that this is evidence that the mosaic was created in pieces and reassembled in Pompeii. 

The fact that this scene was made to be viewed in the house of a Roman civilian reveals that Alexander the Great was more than just a heroic image to the Romans. Because Roman leaders followed after Alexander&#x27;s image, Roman civilians also aspired to emulate the power he represented. Since the mosaic was arranged on the floor where the patron could receive guests, it was the first decorative object a visitor would see upon entering that room. Modern research indicates that there may have been multiple columns removed from the colonnade to improve lighting and viewing of the mosaic.

Similar to Greek paintings, the mosaic of Alexander the Great lacks rich iconography towards the top, which, on a vertical surface, would have been considerably higher above the viewer&#x27;s line of sight and garnered less creative attention. This is one way in which the two forms of art are comparable to one another. As a bonus, the mosaic displays the realism and naturalism typical of Greek portrayals of humans, especially regarding facial expression, emotional tone, and anatomical structure.

=== Originality ===
The Alexander Mosaic is believed to be a copy of a Hellenistic Greek painting made during the 4th century BC. The style of the mosaic is distinctly Greek in that it depicts close up portraits of the main heroes of the battle. Typically within Greek battle scenes the heroes are difficult to define within the commotion. The mosaic contains very specific details that scholars believe would have been lost if the mosaic was created any later than a couple hundred years after the battle. It is a commonly accepted belief concerning the Alexander mosaic that one must use the Greek original to interpret the meaning of the Roman copy. The debate among scholars over the significance of the Roman copy is that it cannot and should not be interpreted in the same cultural and historical context as the Greek original. Some believe that in doing so, it takes away both context and achievement from Roman artists. The mosaic is held to be a copy either of a painting by Aristides of Thebes, or of a lost late 4th-century BC fresco by the painter Philoxenus of Eretria. The latter is mentioned by Pliny the Elder (XXXV, 110) as a commission for the Macedonian king Cassander.

===Modern history===
The Alexander Mosaic was preserved due to the volcanic ash that collected over the mosaic during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in the city of Pompeii in 79 AD. This Roman artwork was found inlaid into the ground of the House of the Faun in between two open peristyles. The mosaic was used to decorate the floor of a second tablinum or exedra (an open room or area that contains seating that is used for conversing). The House of the Faun was a large estate comprising one whole block in Pompeii; this is an area of about 3,000 square meters.

As a significant artwork and piece of history, the scene of the Mosaic remained in the social and cultural sphere. The mosaic was rediscovered in 1831 in Pompeii, Italy, and was later transported to Naples in September 1843. The Alexander Mosaic is now displayed on a wall and preserved in Naples. Until recently it has been on display at the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, although currently its site is covered with a facsimile banner and it appears to have been removed for restoration or display elsewhere. In 1956, the Alexander Mosaic was featured on the ₯1,000 banknote.

===Modern copy===
In 2003, the International Center for the Study and Teaching of Mosaic (CISIM) in Ravenna, Italy, proposed creating a copy of the mosaic. After CISIM received approval for the project, the mosaic master Severo Bignami and his eight-person team took a large photograph of the mosaic, made a tracing of the image with a dark marker and created a negative impression of it.

The team composed the mosaic in sections in 44 clay frames, trying to preserve the pieces of the mosaic in the exact positions they are in the original mosaic. They had to keep the plates wet at all times. Then they pressed a tissue on the clay to create an image of the outlines of the mosaic in the clay. The team recreated the mosaic with about 2 million pieces of various marble types. When they had placed all the pieces, they covered the result with a layer of glue and gauze and pulled it out of the clay. They placed each section on synthetic concrete and then united the sections with the compound of glass, wool and plastic.

The project took 22 months and cost the equivalent of $216,000. The copy was installed in the House of the Faun in 2005.

=== Conservation ===
In 2015, IPERION CH, the Integrated Platform for the European Research Infrastructure ON Cultural Heritage, researched the mosaic and used various non-invasive analysis techniques to discover the physical composition of the mosaic, in addition to learning which parts were original and which were added after rediscovery. In 2018, a photogrammetric model was created of the mosaic, revealing flaws and cracks invisible to the human eye.

In January 2021 the National Archaeological Museum of Naples began a major restoration project to attempt to conserve the mosaic. In the initial assessment of the mosaic, multiple issues were discovered, including detached tesserae, cracks, bulges and surface depressions. Some areas had been already treated, such as multiple cracks that had been covered by thin paper bandages in a &quot;velinatura&quot; technique, in prior restoration efforts.

=== The Alexander Mosaic in the History of the House ===
The House of the Faun at Pompeii was immediately recognized by its size and decoration as one of the town’s most important houses. Adolf Hoffmann argues that the House of the Faun was constructed in two principal phases.

Hoffmann refers to the first phase as the &quot;first House of the Faun&quot; and has recently attempted a reconstruction. In the first half, or at latest by the middle of the second century BC, the two atria (from image: 27 and 7) and the first peristyle (from image: 36, originally in the Doric order) were constructed. Another distinctive feature of this first phase was the absence, from the north side of the first peristyle, of the Alexander Mosaic and its exedra (37). A large room, underlying the later rooms to the east of the Alexander exedra (from image: 42, 38, and 43), served the first peristyle as its principal exedra during this first phase. Overall, the first incarnation of the House of the Faun dated back to c. 180 BC, occupied two-thirds of the insula and consisted of two atria, one small house and one peristyle.

According to Hoffmann, the Alexander exedra was not originally part of the layout of the first peristyle. Hoffmann has observed that the first peristyle, originally built in the Doric order, belongs to the earliest phase of the house. The layout of the first peristyle is the key to the house&#x27;s design, in both practice and theory. The first peristyle dominates the house not only visually and functionally, but it also commands the design, determining the locations and the dimensions of the other major parts. The room is so strategically placed that it would not be an exaggeration to say that the rest of the house had been designed and built around the site with the great treasure of mosaic art set in its floor.

Next, Hoffmann argues, the second phase of the house-the second House of the Faun-commenced through an extensive rebuilding and renovating of the first house. The first peristyle (36) was &quot;refashioned in the Ionic order and was reconstructed into a new peristyle. The Alexander exedra (37) was constructed, facing south, onto the first peristyle. A major renovation phase beginning c. 110 BC and ending c. 75 BC comprised a new decoration in the so-called First Style (including all the well-known mosaic pavements), as well as the insertion of a second entrance into the tetrastyle atrium, a switch from Doric to Ionic in the portico of the small peristyle, and the construction of the large north peristyle.

In addition to the Alexander Mosaic, several other floor mosaics representing Nilotic events and theatrical masks surround the Alexander Mosaic. This piece of art draws from various artistic periods and movements, including Roman, Hellenistic, and Italic. The name of this mosaic comes from the fact that it was found in a period of the Roman Empire known as the &quot;late Roman Republic.&quot;

Eight pictorial mosaics were laid in the House of the Faun as part of a major renovation program of the early first century BC. Many of them have iconography linking them to Ptolemaic Egypt, like a mosaic triptych depicting Egyptian animals in a Nilotic landscape, fish emblema, an emblema depicting a cat attacking a bird that represents statues with the same theme from Ptolemaic Egypt, and emblemas of other animals with Ptolemaic Egypt themes. It has traditionally been held that these compositions were laid at different times, the Alexander Mosaic in c. 110 BC and the Nilotic triptych in c. 80 BC. This view rests on the observation that the bases of the threshold columns were cut back to accommodate the panels of the triptych, and on a perception that the triptych is technically less accomplished than the Alexander Mosaic.

<text>Alicante Bouschet or Alicante Henri Bouschet is a wine grape variety that has been widely cultivated since 1866. It is a cross of Petit Bouschet (itself a cross of the very old variety Teinturier du Cher and Aramon) and Grenache. Alicante is a &quot;teinturier&quot;, a grape with red flesh. It is one of the few &quot;teinturier&quot; grapes that belong to the &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; species. Its deep colour makes it useful for blending with light red wine. It was planted heavily during Prohibition in California for export to the East Coast. Its thick skin made it resistant to rot during the transportation process. The intense red color was also helpful for stretching the wine during prohibition, as it could be diluted without detracting from the appearance. At the turn of the 21st century, Alicante Bouschet was the 12th most planted red wine grape in France with sizable plantings in the Languedoc, Provence and Cognac regions. In 1958, Alicante Bouschet covered 24,168 hectares (mainly across southern France); by 2011, plantings represented less than 4,000 hectares. This scenario is largely reversed in other regions of Europe, and in southern Portugal, where its wines are highly prized and frequently outscore traditional autochthonous varieties.

==History and breeding==
The grape was first cultivated in France in 1866 by Henri Bouschet as a cross of Petit Bouschet and Grenache. The Petit Bouschet grape was created by his father Louis Bouschet. The result was to produce a grape with deep color and of higher quality than the Teinturier du Cher. Several varieties of Alicante Bouschet were produced of varying quality. The grape&#x27;s high yields and easy maintenance encouraged its popularity among French wine growers, especially in the years following the Phylloxera epidemic. By the end of the 19th century there were Alicante Bouschet plantings in Bordeaux, Burgundy, Loire Valley and Alentejo, Portugal

The grape was widely popular in the United States during the years of Prohibition. Grape growers in California&#x27;s Central Valley found that its pulp was so fleshy and juicy that fermentable juice could be retrieved even after the third pressing. In contrast, wines made from grapes like Chardonnay and Merlot typically only include the juice from the free run (before pressing) and first or second pressing. The grape&#x27;s thick skin also meant that it could survive the long railway transportation from California to New York City&#x27;s Pennsylvania Station which had auction rooms where the grapes were sold.

The superior transportability of this variety was significant because of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service on July 25, 1920, in connection with original wording in the Volstead Act, which allowed up to 200 gallons of home-made wine per year, per household, for consumption in the home only. In 1928, one single auction lot of 225 carloads of grapes were purchased by a single buyer. The amount of grapes was enough to make more than of wine.

==Wine regions==

In France, the grape was historically a blending partner with Aramon but in recent times has been made more into its own varietal. However, planting of new vines has steadily declined. In some areas of France the grape is now extinct. According to international wine guru and Master of Wine, Jancis Robinson, Alicante Bouschet is thought to have found its true home in Portugal&#x27;s Alentejo where it was first planted at Herdade do Mouchão in the late 1800s. Widely planted across the Alentejo wine region today (having grown exponentially in popularity from the late 1990s) it is frequently expensive, surpassing the quality and personality of other noble varieties. These top-end wines are prized for their &#x27;size&#x27;, dense colour and phenolic content. In Chile the grape is blended with Cabernet Sauvignon and to make concentrated varietal wines. In California the grape was popular among home winemakers during Prohibition and still grown today in Napa, Sonoma, Madera, and Calaveras counties. Other areas with notable Alicante Bouschet plantings include Algeria, Palestine and parts of central and southern Italy.

In Spain Alicante Bouschet is called &quot;garnacha tintorera&quot; or &quot;negral&quot; and it is the fifth most planted red grape variety in with 22,572 ha (55,776 acres) grown in 2015.

Recognized by many today as a noble red variety (particularly in southern Iberia), Alicante Bouschet is known for its deep dark color, more than 15 times the color of Aramon and twice the darkness of the Grand Noir de la Calmette. Under specific conditions, the grape can produce high yields of up to 80 hl/ha. It buds and ripens early-to-mid season to produce wines high in alcohol, particularly where jamminess is valued and extended &#x27;hang-time&#x27; is practiced. The wines tend to be short on primary aromas and can lack character and complexity when young. Alicante Bouschet performs best under specific conditions and where tertiary aromas are allowed to predominate through ageing. The grape vine is thought to be prone to grape diseases like anthracnose, downy mildew and occasionally bunch rots in rare instances where bunches are tight at harvest. Alicante Bouschet leaves turn a beautiful purple hue in late autumn.

==Crosses==
Alibernet - crossing of Alicante Bouschet x Cabernet Sauvignon was bred in 1950 in the Ukrainian Scientific Research Institute for Wine and Vines in Odessa. It is planted in Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic.

Lusitano - Alicante Bouschet is thought to be a parent of this rare Portuguese grape having been crossed with Castelão (aka Periquita)

&quot;Roger&#x27;s Red&quot; — Prized for its scarlet-crimson fall leaf color, this naturally occurring hybrid of Vitis californica and Vitis vinifera, &quot;Alicante Bouschet&quot; was discovered in Sonoma County, California, in 1983 by Roger Raiche. It is widely propagated and sold in nurseries. Genetic testing at the University of California, Davis, confirmed its hybrid status, not a natural variant of the native California grape.

<text>The common eider (pronounced ) (Somateria mollissima), also called St. Cuthbert&#x27;s duck or Cuddy&#x27;s duck, is a large ( in body length) sea-duck that is distributed over the northern coasts of Europe, North America and eastern Siberia. It breeds in Arctic and some northern temperate regions, but winters somewhat farther south in temperate zones, when it can form large flocks on coastal waters. It can fly at speeds up to .

The eider&#x27;s nest is built close to the sea and is lined with eiderdown, plucked from the female&#x27;s breast. This soft and warm lining has long been harvested for filling pillows and quilts, but in more recent years has been largely replaced by down from domestic farm-geese and synthetic alternatives. Although eiderdown pillows or quilts are now a rarity—typically being marketed as luxury goods—eiderdown harvesting continues and is sustainable, as it can be done after the ducklings leave the nest with no harm to the birds.

==Taxonomy==
The common eider was formally named by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the other ducks in the genus &quot;Anas&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Anas mollissima&quot;. It is now placed with two other species in the genus &quot;Somateria&quot; that was introduced in 1819 by the English zoologist William Leach. The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;sōma&quot; &#x27;body&#x27; (stem &quot;somat-&quot;) and &quot;erion&quot; &#x27;wool&#x27;. The specific &quot;mollissimus&quot; is Latin, meaning &#x27;very soft&#x27;. Both parts of the name refer to its down feathers.

Six subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;S. m. v-nigrum&quot; Bonaparte &amp; Gray, GR, 1855 – breeds in northeast Asia and Alaska; winters in the Bering Sea and the Aleutian Islands
* &quot;S. m. borealis&quot; (Brehm, CL, 1824) – breeds in northeast Canada, Greenland and Iceland; winters in the north Atlantic
* &quot;S. m. sedentaria&quot; Snyder, 1941 – breeds in Hudson Bay and James Bay (Canada) 
* &quot;S. m. dresseri&quot; Sharpe, 1871 – breeds in southeast Canada and northeast USA; winters around northwest Atlantic coasts
* &quot;S. m. faeroeensis&quot; Brehm, CL, 1831 – Faroe Islands
* &quot;S. m. mollissima&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – breeds in northwest Eurasia; winters in northwest and central Europe

==Description==

The common eider is both the largest of the four eider species and the largest duck found in Europe, and is exceeded in North America only by smatterings of the Muscovy duck, which only reaches North America in a wild state in southernmost Texas (and arguably south Florida where feral but non-native populations reside). It measures in length, weighs and spans across the wings. The average weight of 22 males in the North Atlantic was while 32 females weighed an average of . It is characterized by its bulky shape and large, wedge-shaped bill. The male is unmistakable, with its black and white plumage and green nape. The female is a brown bird, but can still be readily distinguished from all ducks, except other eider species, on the basis of size and head shape. The drake&#x27;s display call is a strange almost human-like &quot;ah-ooo&quot;, while the hen utters hoarse quacks. The species is often readily approachable.

Drakes of the European, eastern North American and Asia/western North American races can be distinguished by minor differences in plumage and bill colour. Some authorities place the subspecies &quot;v-nigra&quot; as a separate species.

This species dives for crustaceans and molluscs, with mussels being a favoured food. The eider will eat mussels by swallowing them whole; the shells are then crushed in their gizzard and excreted. When eating a crab, the eider will remove all of its claws and legs, and then eat the body in a similar fashion.

It is abundant, with populations of about 1.5–2 million birds in both North America and Europe, and also large but unknown numbers in eastern Siberia (HBW).

A particularly famous colony of eiders lives on the Farne Islands in Northumberland, England. These birds were the subject of one of the first ever bird protection laws, established by Saint Cuthbert in the year 676. About 1,000 pairs still nest there every year. Because St. Cuthbert is the patron saint of Northumberland, it was natural that the eider should be chosen as the county&#x27;s emblem bird; the birds are still often called Cuddy&#x27;s ducks in the area, &quot;Cuddy&quot; being the familiar form of &quot;Cuthbert&quot;.

In Canada&#x27;s Hudson Bay, important eider die-offs were observed in the 1990s by local populations due to quickly changing ice flow patterns. The Canadian Wildlife Service has spent several years gathering up-to-date information on their populations, and preliminary results seem to show a population recovery. The common eider is the object of the 2011 documentary &quot;People of a Feather&quot;, which studies the historical relationship between the Sanikiluaq community and eiders, as well as various aspects of their ecology.

The common eider is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.

==Social behaviour==
Eiders are colonial breeders. They nest on coastal islands in colonies ranging in size of less than 100 to upwards of 15,000 individuals. Female eiders frequently exhibit a high degree of natal philopatry, where they return to breed on the same island where they were hatched. This can lead to a high degree of relatedness between individuals nesting on the same island, as well as the development of kin-based female social structures. This relatedness has likely played a role in the evolution of co-operative breeding behaviours amongst eiders. Examples of these behaviours include laying eggs in the nests of related individuals and crèching, where female eiders team up and share the work of rearing ducklings.

<text>Patrick Frank Friesen (born 5 July 1946) is a Canadian author born in Steinbach, Manitoba, primarily known for his poetry and stage plays beginning in the 1970s.
==Life and career==

Friesen was born into a Mennonite family in Steinbach, Manitoba in 1946. As a child growing up in Steinbach, he was friends with Shingoose, who later became a well-known musician, and Wayne Tefs, future author and co-founder of Turnstone Press. After graduating high school at the Steinbach Collegiate Institute, he studied at the University of Manitoba and lived in Winnipeg for thirty years.

In addition to poetry, Friesen has also written songs and collaborated with dancers, choreographers, composers and musicians. His Mennonite upbringing still influences his writing in work such as &quot;The Shunning&quot;, which is about the persecution of a Mennonite farmer questioning his religion. Friesen won the McNally Robinson Book of the Year Award at the Manitoba Book Awards for his work on &quot;Blasphemer&#x27;s Wheel,&quot; and was runner up in Milton Acorn&#x27;s People&#x27;s Poetry Awards. In 1997, his work, &quot;A Broken Bowl&quot;, was short listed for the Governor General&#x27;s Award for English-language poetry.

Friesen collaborated with Per Brask on the translation from Danish of Ulrikka S. Gernes&#x27; &quot;Frayed Opus for Strings &amp; Wind Instruments&quot;, which was shortlisted for the 2016 Griffin Poetry Prize.
Friesen lives in Victoria, British Columbia, and is a teacher of creative writing at the University of Victoria. He is married to poet Eve Joseph.

<doc id="262906" wikidata="Q1056408" url="?curid=262906" title="Open file format">
<text>An open file format is a file format for storing digital data, defined by an openly published specification usually maintained by a standards organization, and which can be used and implemented by anyone. An open file format is licensed with an open license.

For example, an open format can be implemented by both proprietary and free and open-source software, using the typical software licenses used by each. In contrast to open file formats, closed file formats are considered trade secrets.

Depending on the definition, the specification of an open format may require a fee to access or, very rarely, contain other restrictions. The range of meanings is similar to that of the term open standard.

==Specific definitions==

===UK government===
In 2012 the UK Government created the policy Open Standards Principles, stating that the Open Standards Principles apply to every aspect of government IT and that Government technology must remain open to everyone. They have seven principles for selecting open standards for use in government, following these principals many open formats were adopted, notably Open Document Format (ODF). The seven principles for selecting open standards for use in the UK government are:

* Open standards must meet user needs
* Open standards must give suppliers equal access to government contracts
* Open standards must support flexibility and change
* Open standards must support sustainable cost
* Select open standards using well-informed decisions
* Select open standards using fair and transparent processes
* Specify and implement open standards using fair and transparent processes

===US government===
Within the framework of Open Government Initiative, the federal government of the United States adopted the Open Government Directive, according to which: &quot;An open format is one that is platform independent, machine readable, and made available to the public without restrictions that would impede the re-use of that information&quot;.

===State of Minnesota===
The State of Minnesota defines the criteria for open, XML-based file formats as follows:

* The format is interoperable among diverse internal and external platforms and applications
* The format is fully published and available royalty-free
* The format is implemented by multiple vendors
* The format is controlled by an open industry organization with a well-defined inclusive process for evolution of the standard

===Commonwealth of Massachusetts===
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts &quot;defines open formats as specifications for data file formats that are based on an underlying open standard, developed by an open community, affirmed and maintained by a standards body and are fully documented and publicly available.&quot;

The Enterprise Technical Reference Model (ETRM) classifies four formats as &quot;Open Formats&quot;:
#OASIS Open Document Format For Office Applications (OpenDocument) v. 1.1
#Ecma-376 Office Open XML Formats (Open XML)
#Hypertext Document Format v. 4.01
#Plain Text Format

===Sun Microsystems===
Sun Microsystems defined the criteria for open formats as follows:
* The format is based on an underlying open standard
* The format is developed through a publicly visible, community-driven process
* The format is affirmed and maintained by a vendor-independent standards organization
* The format is fully documented and publicly available
* The format does not contain proprietary extensions

===The Linux Information Project===
According to The Linux Information Project, the term &quot;open format&quot; should refer to &quot;any format that is published for anyone to read and study but which may or may not be encumbered by patents, copyrights or other restrictions on use&quot; – as opposed to a &quot;free format&quot; which is &quot;not&quot; encumbered by any copyrights, patents, trademarks or other restrictions.

==Examples of open formats==
Open formats (in the royalty-free and free access sense) include:
* PNG — a raster image format standardized by ISO/IEC
* FLAC — lossless audio codec
* WebM — a video/audio container format
* HTML — is the main markup language for creating web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser.
* gzip — for compression
* CSS — style sheet format usually used with (X)HTML, standardized by W3C
* PDF: an ISO-standardized file format for reliable document exchange across platforms;

The following formats are open (royalty-free with a one-time fee on the standard):
* Office Open XML: the ECMA version is downloadable for no charge, but the newer ISO versions require a fee;
* OpenDocument: As adopted by the UK Government in 2012 to meet their open standards principles, for Government technology to remain open to everyone.
* C language: royalty-free, but ISO standard requires a fee (drafts available for no charge);

<text>Ladan and Laleh Bijani (Persian: ; 17 January 1974 – 8 July 2003) were Iranian conjoined twin sisters. They were joined at the head and died soon after their complicated surgical separation.

== Biography ==
They were born in Firuzabad, a city in southwest Iran, to Dadollah Bijani and Maryam Safari, members of a farming family from the nearby Lohrasb village. The Bijani sisters were lost in a hospital in 1979 after the doctors responsible for them had to suddenly leave for the United States during the revolution in Iran. The Bijanis&#x27; parents did not find the sisters again until several years later in the city of Karaj near Tehran, where Alireza Safaian had adopted them. While in his custody, Safaian attempted to protect them by sequestering them from the world as best as he could. In 1996, after years of searching, the girls&#x27; biological parents finally tracked them down and made contact. In their early twenties, the twins lived on their own in an apartment while attending law school.

Ladan wanted to be a lawyer, while Laleh wished to become a journalist; in the end, they settled on Ladan&#x27;s choice. They studied law for four years at Tehran University. Most other personal decisions also had to meet each other&#x27;s approval. For these and other reasons, they had wanted to be separated since they were children. Laleh hoped that she could then move to Tehran, the capital city of Iran, to study journalism, while Ladan wanted to continue with graduate studies in law and then move to Shiraz.

In addition, the sisters had different hobbies. While Laleh liked to, among other things, play computer games, Ladan preferred computer programming. Ladan also described Laleh as more introverted and herself as quite talkative.

== Separation ==
In 1996, they travelled to Germany, trying to convince doctors there to separate them; the German doctors, however, declined to operate, saying that the risk of separation surgery would be too high for both of them.

In November 2002, after meeting Keith Goh, the Bijani sisters travelled to Singapore to undergo the controversial operation. Even though they were warned by the doctors that the surgery to separate them would still be very risky, the sisters were very determined. Their decision to proceed with the operation led to considerable international media interest.

=== Surgery ===
After eight months in Singapore, doing extensive psychiatric and legal evaluations, they underwent surgery on 6 July 2003, under the care of a large team of international specialists at Raffles Hospital, composed of 28 doctors and more than 100 medical assistants working in shifts. A specially designed chair was required that allowed the operation to be performed with both sisters in a sitting position.

Goh led the team to operate on Laleh while Ben Carson, director of paediatric surgery at the Johns Hopkins Children&#x27;s Centre, led the team operating on Ladan.

The attempt to separate the twins turned out to be very difficult, because their brains not only shared a major vein (the superior sagittal sinus), but had fused together. In addition, an undetected major vein hidden from the scans was discovered during the operation.

During the operation, doctors encountered a mass of previously undetected blood vessels. Goh decided to continue with the operation while Carson felt that the surgery should have stopped at that moment.

The separation was achieved on 8 July 2003, but it was announced then that the twins were in critical condition, both having lost a large volume of blood due to complications of the operation. 

The separation stage of the surgery was completed at 13:30 SST, but there was significant blood loss during the blood vessel repairing process, and Ladan Bijani died at around 14:30 on the operating table; her sister Laleh Bijani died 90 minutes later. Their deaths were announced by the chairman of Raffles Hospital, Loo Choon Yong.

A coroner inquest was held after the deaths of the conjoined twins and their deaths were ruled a misadventure.

The twins&#x27; operation was referenced in an episode of &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; with Annie and Lizzie being conjoined twins attempting separation.

== Burials ==
The sisters were buried in accordance to Shiite Muslim traditions in separate tombs, side by side, in Lohrasb. The sisters willed their property to blind and orphaned children.

A documentary about the operation was broadcast soon after. Later, people named 17 January as Hope&#x27;s day.

<doc id="262915" wikidata="Q705248" url="?curid=262915" title="Luo Gan">
<text>Luo Gan (; born July 18, 1935) is a retired Chinese politician. Between 2002 and 2007, Luo was one of China&#x27;s top leaders, serving as a member of the nine-man Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and as the Secretary of Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission (&quot;Zhengfawei&quot;), which became one of China&#x27;s most powerful political offices, and well-funded bureaucracies, during Luo&#x27;s term. In his &quot;Zhengfawei&quot; role, Luo held oversight for many law-enforcement institutions, including the police, public security officers, armed police, labor camps, prisons, and the judicial system. Luo retired from politics in 2007.

==Early career==
Luo Gan was born in Jinan, Shandong province. In 1953, he began studying engineering at the Beijing Steel and Iron Institute. A year later, he was selected as part of a Chinese contingent to go study at Karl Marx University in Leipzig, East Germany where he studied German language. He interned at the Leipzig steel and metalworks plant. He then continued studying machine works at Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg. Luo joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1960, while still in Germany. It was said that Luo had stellar grades and won the Agricola prize for academic achievement while studying in Germany.

Upon returning to China, Luo continued to work in the steel industry, first being sent to the First Ministry of Machine-Building, a state-run department in charge of machines, telecommunications, and shipbuilding. There he worked as a technician and project leader in its mechanics department. As a technical specialist, Luo, like many others in his field, were displaced from their posts during much of the Cultural Revolution, and sent to perform manual labour at a May 7 Cadre School. In 1970, Luo returned to work in Henan province, working for a government machine-building project in Luohe, then transferred to Zhengzhou.

==Rise to power==
In October 1978, as part of a nationwide reshuffle following the demise of the Gang of Four, former First Machine-Building minister Duan Junyi took on the post of party chief of central Henan Province. While in Henan, Duan was eager to promote his former associates, including Luo Gan. In 1980, Luo was made head of the provincial science and technology commission, and also a leader in the provincial trade office. A year later, Luo was made Vice Governor of Henan.

In 1983, Luo was sent to Beijing and became deputy chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the state-sponsored trade union group. As a major leader of the ACFTU, Luo was in charge of the day-to-day management of the organization. As a result of his tenure in the union, Luo was made Minister of Labour in March 1988. In December 1988, Luo took over duties of the Secretary-General of the State Council as a result of the illness of his predecessor Chen Junsheng.

During his term as a minister, Luo had developed a close relationship with Li Peng came to be considered one of Li&#x27;s protégés. Luo was appointed a State Councilor, a position with equivalent rank but slightly lesser responsibility compared as a Vice-Premier, in 1993. He served in the position until 2003. In September 1997 at the 15th Party Congress, Luo advanced further, being named a Secretary of the Central Secretariat, the Secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission (&quot;Zhengfawei&quot;), and a member of the 15th Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party, joining the inner sanctum of party leaders.

Luo oversaw a diverse portfolio with jurisdiction over law enforcement and internal security, as well as &quot;comprehensive social management&quot;, a nebulous new phrase that essentially meant asserting control and preventing organized protests and social disturbances; as part of his responsibilities, he was tasked by Jiang Zemin to head the 610 Office, an extrajudicial organ established to suppress the spiritual group Falun Gong. As a result of his role, Luo faced heavy criticism from Falun Gong adherents.

==Standing Committee==
Luo entered the Politburo Standing Committee in 2002, at the 16th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party at the age of 67. The Standing Committee was expanded from seven members to nine in 2002, some say as a result of then-Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin attempting to stack the body with his supporters. Luo, then branded by overseas media as an associate of Li Peng, became a major beneficiary of this increase in membership. That he held a seat on the nation&#x27;s highest ruling council, coupled with the relative weakness of the new party General Secretary Hu Jintao, as well as the general focus placed by the Communist Party on internal security and combating dissent to party authority, vastly increased the power of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission. Regarded as the &quot;security chief&quot; of the country, Luo implemented the &quot;strike hard&quot; campaign against extremism in Xinjiang and against organised crime, increasing the harshness of sentences; some suggest that this policy led to increased executions; it was said that Luo had personally directed the suppression of &quot;illegal organisations&quot; such as the Falun Gong movement and protests such as that at the Pubugou Dam protest in 2004.

Luo&#x27;s term as the chief of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission was also characterized by proponents of the Weiquan movement as having further solidified party control over legal and judicial affairs, and thus impeding progress on human rights and legal freedoms. During his tenure, Luo was seen to have warned party officials to rein in judicial independence and but also pay heed to the international implications of legal activities in China, while also expanding &quot;rule by law&quot;.

Luo retired from the Politburo Standing Committee at the age of 72, after the 17th Party Congress in October 2007. By 2007, rules related to mandated retirement age have been largely entrenched within the Communist Party hierarchy. Luo, as the oldest member of the Standing Committee by that time, naturally must retire. His &quot;Zhengfawei&quot; portfolio was then inherited by Zhou Yongkang, a former oil baron who went on to oversee an even greater expansion of powers of the portfolio. Zhou was eventually convicted on corruption charges and sentenced to prison in 2015.

Luo largely disappeared from the public eye following his retirement in 2007. In 2015, the Chinese authorities published &quot;Luo Gan on Law and Politics Work in China&quot; (), a compilation of Luo&#x27;s thoughts on law enforcement work during his tenure. Luo also made a public appearance at the 2015 China Victory Day Parade.

On December 17, 2009, Argentinian Federal Judge Octavio Araoz de Lamadrid issued a national and international Interpol warrant for the detention of Luo Gan, along with Jiang Zemin. The warrant was issued with basis on the investigation of 17 testimonies of Falun Gong practitioners victims of persecution, along with reports by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and the UN detailed in case Nº 17885/2005.

<doc id="262917" wikidata="Q560391" url="?curid=262917" title="Li Changchun">
<text>Li Changchun (born February 1, 1944) is a retired Chinese politician and a former senior leader of the Chinese Communist Party. He served on the Politburo Standing Committee, the party&#x27;s top leadership council, and as the top official in charge of propaganda, between 2002 and 2012. He also served as Chairman of the CCP Central Guidance Commission for Building Spiritual Civilization, &quot;de facto&quot; head of propaganda and media relations. Li had a widely varying political career spanning three provinces, first as Governor of Liaoning, then Party Secretary of Henan, and then CCP Committee Secretary of Guangdong, before being promoted to the national leadership in 2002. He retired in 2012.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Li Changchun was born in February 1944 in modern-day Dalian, Liaoning, then administered by the Empire of Japan as &quot;Dairen&quot;, Kwantung Leased Territory. He joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1965 and graduated with a degree in electrical engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology in 1966. In 1983, at age 39, he became the youngest mayor and Party secretary of a major city, of Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning. In 1982, he was also made an alternate member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party at the age of 38, the youngest member of the body at the time. In 1987, he became governor of Liaoning province, a post he kept until 1990. As governor, mainland China&#x27;s first expressway was built in the province, linking the cities of Shenyang and Dalian. In addition, Li pushed for the reform of state-owned enterprises, aiming to decrease state involvement in their operations.

After General Secretary Zhao Ziyang was purged from the party leadership in 1989 during the fallout from the Tiananmen Square protests that same year, Li was initially also thought to have been removed from the leadership because he was a supporter of Zhao. Li&#x27;s appearance on state television weeks later showed that this was not the case.

In 1990, Li was transferred from his job in Liaoning province to central Henan province. In his memoirs, Li recounted that he was ill-prepared for his new assignment and felt homesick. The central authorities had not given him much prior notice about his transfer, and did not inform him why he was being moved or facilitate an orderly transition process. Li, as a result, was somewhat critical of the party&#x27;s transfer process but nonetheless duly accepted his new assignment. He had succeeded then-Henan governor Cheng Weigao, who had been transferred to Hebei province as part of a three-province &#x27;leader swap&#x27; orchestrated by the party&#x27;s leaders. Henan, a populous agricultural province without a strong industrial base, presented Li with significant challenges, and Li had experienced unease settling into his new home.

Two years later, in 1992, Li was promoted to party chief of Henan. It would be Li&#x27;s first job as &quot;first-in-charge&quot; of a province. Being accustomed to serving in government administration, Li&#x27;s tenure in Henan was his first taste of being in charge of party affairs. Li said that initially being the top leader in the province made him uncomfortable as he had to shoulder all responsibility, especially at a time when other regions were developing economically at a pace much faster than that of Henan. Overall, his tenure in Henan was seen as mediocre. Rural incomes remained stagnant during his term, and his government was also criticized for its role in the Plasma Economy, where farmers were encouraged to donate blood through unsafe practices, triggering China&#x27;s largest outbreak of HIV/AIDS.

===Guangdong===
Li was promoted to the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party in 1997, largely due to having secured the patronage of the paramount leader and Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin. In his memoirs, Li said that he was surprised at having been appointed to the Politburo. In 1998, Jiang dispatched Li to serve as Guangdong Party Secretary. It was said that Jiang wanted to use Li as a counterbalance to the entrenched local political establishment composed mostly of people native to the province. In Guangdong, Li cracked down on corruption to &quot;put the house in order.&quot; In the wake of the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997-98, Li set up a special task force to evaluate what to do with non-performing loans owed by two of the province&#x27;s largest financial companies. He appointed former central bank deputy governor Wang Qishan to oversee the task force. Li shook up the local banking sector and closed a plethora of local credit unions and agencies. He also increased access to the legal aid system for the poor in the province. His tenure in Guangdong was seen as largely successful, having averted the brunt of the Asian Financial Crisis and also bringing Guangdong back to the political control of the central leadership under Jiang Zemin after sidelined many local officials promoted by Ye Xuanping, former Governor of Guangdong and the elder son of Marshal Ye Jianying.

Li&#x27;s tenure in Guangdong made him one of Jiang&#x27;s favourites and as such Jiang was preparing to groom him for succession for the premiership upon incumbent Premier Zhu Rongji&#x27;s scheduled retirement in 2003. However, Zhu had been favouring Wen Jiabao for the Premier office, and criticized Li over his handling of an &quot;export rebate fraud&quot; scandal in the coastal city of Shantou in 2000, which took place during Li&#x27;s term as Guangdong party chief. By the end, Wen Jiabon won this competition and became Premier of China in March 2003. Li&#x27;s intention to promote Huang Liman, a female friend of Jiang&#x27;s who was considered incompetent, to the party chief position in the coastal city of Shenzhen became a sticking point for Jiang&#x27;s political opponents.

===Politburo Standing Committee===
As expected, Li was named a member of the Politburo Standing Committee after Jiang&#x27;s departure as General Secretary of the CCP in 2002. By then, Li was seen by political observers as firmly belonging to Jiang&#x27;s camp. He was considered one of Jiang&#x27;s major &#x27;patronage appointments&#x27; to the top ruling council along with other staunch Jiang loyalists such as Jia Qinglin and Huang Ju. Li was ranked eighth in the party hierarchy out of the nine members of the new PSC, given the portfolio of supervising the Party organs that dealt with propaganda and ideology while taking on no other official party or state titles.

Li was the first propaganda chief to preside over the growth of the internet in China, and as a result was largely seen as having been the forerunner in developing the internet censorship regime that became increasingly extensive over the course of his tenure. In October 2007, at the 17th Party Congress, it was announced that Li, then aged 63 (below the unofficial age of retirement for PSC members, 67), would serve another term as propaganda chief. In addition, Li was elevated from eight position in the protocol sequence to fifth, in front of Hu Jintao&#x27;s putative successor Xi Jinping.

There were high hopes among some in media circles that Li would signal a more liberal change from the strictures of former propaganda chief Ding Guangen. Li had made a major speech advocating that media stay &quot;close to the public&quot; and to real events, &quot;instead of mechanically following Party directives.&quot; In addition, Li was also seen as a leading reformer due to his legacy in Guangdong, where he was not afraid to take on entrenched interests and introduce further market economic reforms. The hopes were short-lived however, though, after the Central Propaganda Department began closing newspapers, firing journalists, and would not allow foreign companies to produce content for TV stations in China. Many editors were punished and Li Changchun &quot;started sounding and acting like another Ding Guangen.&quot;

Li retired from PSC in 2012, when Liu Yunshan succeeded his position as the propaganda chief.

==Propaganda work==

In his position as China&#x27;s propaganda chief from 2002 to 2012, Li was said to have contributed heavily to China&#x27;s censorship campaign and frequently ordered media to downplay or not report on certain events. In 2006, he told the members of the All-China Journalists Association to &quot;closely encircle the overall work of the party and state&quot;. Li approved the construction of the National Museum in 2006 after a series of disputes and delays about the building of the museum. He was the guest of honor at the opening of the National Center for the Performing Arts.

Li has put his support behind a number of creative projects that might otherwise have been censored by the government. He supported &quot;Zen Shaolin&quot;, a music, dance and martial arts show intended to increase tourism that opened in 2007 in Henan, despite the producers&#x27; concerns that a celebration of religion and sacred music would be opposed by the government. Li allowed a 2009 movie &quot;Nanking! Nanking!&quot; by Lu Chuan to continue running in theaters in the face of strong pressure from nationalists who objected to the sympathetic characterization in the film of a Japanese soldier. The film was one of ten chosen to help commemorate 60th anniversary of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

In May 2009, American diplomats reported in a cable that was later leaked that Li was a driving force behind China&#x27;s renewed pressure against Google to comply with Chinese censorship laws. Li was reportedly unhappy that Chinese Google search results for his and his children&#x27;s names contained results critical of them. He subsequently ordered major Chinese firms to cease doing business with Google, and one source with connections to political elite claimed Li had directed a subsequent cyberattack against Google in retaliation.

==Personal life==
Li is married to Zhang Shurong (), his college sweetheart. Zhang was an engineer.

<text>Robert Marshall Blount Fulford (February 13, 1932 – October 15, 2024) was a Canadian journalist, magazine editor, essayist, and public intellectual. He lived in Toronto, Ontario.

==Background==
Fulford was born on February 13, 1932, in Ottawa, Ontario, the third of four children, to Frances (Blount) Fulford and A. E. Fulford, a journalist and editor at Canadian Press, who had covered the Dionne quintuplets and the 1939 royal tour of Canada of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. He grew up in The Beaches neighbourhood in Toronto and was a childhood friend of Glenn Gould, who was his next door neighbour. In 1952, he and Gould founded New Music Associates, which produced and promoted Gould&#x27;s first three public performances, including the Gould&#x27;s debut performance of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot;. He attended Malvern Collegiate Institute and struggled academically due to undiagnosed Attention Deficit Disorder.

Fulford met his first wife, writer Jocelyn Jean Dingman Fulford (1930–1976), while they were both working at the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot;. They married in 1956 and had two children, Margaret and James. Margaret Fulford is the University College Librarian at the University of Toronto and is married to Professor Jeffrey Rosenthal. Fulford and Dingman divorced in 1970.

Fulford&#x27;s second wife was writer and former CBC Radio producer Geraldine Sherman, whom he met while working on the radio show &quot;This Is Robert Fulford&quot; on CBC. They were married in 1970 and had two children, Sarah and Rachel. Sarah Fulford became editor-in-chief of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine in February 2022, after serving as editor-in-chief of &quot;Toronto Life&quot; magazine for 14 years, and is married to writer Stephen Marche. Rachel Fulford is a psychotherapist and former film and television producer who was director of original production at Showcase.

Fulford suffered a stroke in 2008, in his late seventies, but was able to continue his writing career. He retired his column in the &quot;National Post&quot; in 2019. His last published work was &quot;A Life in Paragraphs&quot;, a collection of essays published in 2020. He had vascular dementia for five years leading up to his death on October 15, 2024, at the age of 92 at Meighen Manor, a long-term care facility in Toronto where he had lived for three years.

==Career==
Fulford&#x27;s media career began at the age of 16, while still in high school, when he worked for Toronto radio station CHUM reporting on high school sports and producing a weekly radio show for teenagers. 

Through his father&#x27;s connections, he began working for the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; as a part-time copy boy while in high school. In the summer of 1950, Fulford dropped out of high school to work for the newspaper full-time as a sports reporter, despite the fact that later in his memoir, he wrote that of his disdain for sports and that he &quot;didn&#x27;t like to watch people play games.&quot; His son-in-law, Stephen Marche observed &quot;the one thing that did not interest him in this world was sports – and yet he wrote fluently and enthusiastically.&quot; His nephew, Marcus Gee, recalled that Fulford having worked as a sports journalist was &quot;a fact that the family always viewed as hilarious given his complete and utter indifference to sports later on.&quot;

Two years later, he became a general assignment reporter at the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot;.

In 1954, Fulford moved to Maclean-Hunter, a magazine publisher, where he wrote for &quot;Canadian Homes and Gardens&quot; and &quot;Mayfair&quot; magazine, for which he was also assistant editor. He also wrote on jazz for the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; and as the freelance Toronto correspondent for &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine. Moving to &quot;The Toronto Star&quot;, he became literary editor and a daily arts columnist (1959–1962). From 1963 to 1964 he was a columnist and editor of the Reviews section at &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine before returning to the &quot;Star&quot; (1964–1968). He also served on the editorial board of &quot;Canadian Forum&quot;. He covered Expo 67 for the newspaper and wrote a book on the world&#x27;s fair, &quot;This Was Expo&quot;.

From 1968 until 1987, Fulford was the editor of &quot;Saturday Night&quot; magazine and also wrote both a general column for the magazine under his own name, and, from 1965 until 1987, film reviews under the pseudonym &quot;Marshall Delaney&quot;. Under his stewardship, &quot;Saturday Night&quot; won five gold medals at the National Magazine Awards. While editor of &quot;Saturday Night&quot; he also wrote a weekly arts column for the &quot;Star&quot; (1971–1987). He then wrote weekly columns for the &quot;Financial Times of Canada&quot; (1988–1992), &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; (1992–1999) and the &quot;National Post&quot; (1999–2019).

Fulford was critical of David Cronenberg&#x27;s films and the usage of funding from the Canadian Film Development Corporation (now Telefilm Canada) and wrote the article &quot;You Ought To Know How Bad This Film Is Because You Paid For It&quot;. Michael Spencer, the head of the CFDC, contacted Cronenberg about Fulford and Cronenberg stated that &quot;only 100 people read &quot;Saturday Night&quot; magazine&quot;, but Spencer replied &quot;Yes but it&#x27;s the wrong hundred people&quot;.

On CBC Radio, he hosted two weekly programs, &quot;The Arts This Week&quot; from 1965 to 1967 and then &quot;This Is Robert Fulford&quot; from 1967 to 1972, where he met his second wife, who originally produced the program. In 1999, he delivered that year&#x27;s Massey Lecture, &quot;The Triumph of Narrative: Storytelling in the Age of Mass Culture&quot; in a series of five programs aired on &quot;Ideas&quot;.

Fulford worked as the co-host with Richard Gwyn of &quot;Realities&quot;, a long-form interview show on TVOntario (1982–1989) and as a regular panelist on CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Morningside&quot; (1989–1993).

He contributed longer essays to the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Quarterly&quot; from 1991 to 2014, winning a National Magazine Award for his essay &quot;Those Imbecilic, Stultifying Games: Notes on the Age of Sports&quot; in 2006. He was also a frequent contributor to &quot;Toronto Life&quot; and &quot;Canadian Art&quot; magazines.

In his 1988 entry for &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot;, Douglas Fetherling described Fulford&#x27;s politics as being on &quot;the more conservative end of the liberal spectrum&quot;.

Fulford was also a critic of literature, art and films. He wrote extensively about the Canadian abstract art group Painters Eleven, its members (particularly William Ronald, Tom Hodgson, and Harold Town), and the Saskatchewan abstract artist Mashel Teitelbaum.

===Honours===
In 1984, Fulford was invested an Officer of the Order of Canada (OC).

He received the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2002 and 2012, respectively. In his career, Fulford won a total of 17 National Magazine Awards, including 14 Gold and 3 Silver awards as well as the Foundation Award for Outstanding Achievement. Other awards he received include the Diplôme d&#x27;honneur from the Canadian Conference of the Arts (1981), the Tom Fairley Award for book editing from the Editors&#x27; Association of Canada (1989), and the Quill Award from the Press Club of Windsor (1989). He was inducted to the Canadian News Hall of Fame in 1990, received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Canadian Journalism Foundation in 1996 and the Kilbourn Award from the Toronto Arts Foundation in 1997.

<text>Ergot ( ) or ergot fungi refers to a group of fungi of the genus Claviceps.

The most prominent member of this group is &quot;Claviceps purpurea&quot; (&quot;rye ergot fungus&quot;). This fungus grows on rye and related plants, and produces alkaloids that can cause ergotism in humans and other mammals who consume grains contaminated with its fruiting structure (called &quot;ergot sclerotium&quot;).

&quot;Claviceps&quot; includes about 50 known species, mostly in the tropical regions. Economically significant species include &quot;C. purpurea&quot; (parasitic on grasses and cereals), &quot;C. fusiformis&quot; (on pearl millet, buffel grass), &quot;C. paspali&quot; (on dallis grass), &quot;C. africana&quot; (on sorghum) and &quot;C. lutea&quot; (on paspalum). &quot;C. purpurea&quot; most commonly affects outcrossing species such as rye (its most common host), as well as triticale, wheat and barley. It affects oats only rarely.

&quot;C. purpurea&quot; has at least three races or varieties, which differ in their host specificity:
*G1 – land grasses of open meadows and fields;
*G2 – grasses from moist, forest and mountain habitats;
*G3 (&quot;C. purpurea&quot; var. &quot;spartinae&quot;) – salt marsh grasses (&quot;Spartina&quot;, &quot;Distichlis&quot;).

==Life cycle==
An ergot kernel, called a &quot;sclerotium&quot;, develops when a spore of fungal species of the genus &quot;Claviceps&quot; infects a floret of flowering grass or cereal. The infection process mimics a pollen grain growing into an ovary during fertilization. Infection requires that the fungal spore have access to the stigma; consequently, plants infected by &quot;Claviceps&quot; are mainly outcrossing species with open flowers, such as rye (&quot;Secale cereale&quot;) and ryegrasses (genus &quot;Lolium&quot;). The proliferating fungal mycelium then destroys the plant ovary and connects with the vascular bundle originally intended for seed nutrition. The first stage of ergot infection manifests itself as a white soft tissue (known as &quot;sphacelia&quot;) producing sugary honeydew, which often drops out of the infected grass florets. This honeydew contains millions of asexual spores (conidia), which insects disperse to other florets. Later, the sphacelia convert into a hard dry sclerotium inside the husk of the floret. At this stage, alkaloids and lipids accumulate in the sclerotium.

&quot;Claviceps &quot; species from tropic and subtropic regions produce macro- and microconidia in their honeydew. Macroconidia differ in shape and size between the species, whereas microconidia are rather uniform, oval to globose (5×3 μm). Macroconidia are able to produce secondary conidia. A germ tube emerges from a macroconidium through the surface of a honeydew drop and a secondary conidium of an oval to pearlike shape is formed, to which the contents of the original macroconidium migrates. Secondary conidia form a white, frost-like surface on honeydew drops and spread via the wind. No such process occurs in &quot;Claviceps purpurea&quot;, &quot;Claviceps grohii&quot;, &quot;Claviceps nigricans&quot; and &quot;Claviceps zizaniae&quot;, all from northern temperate regions.

When a mature sclerotium drops to the ground, the fungus remains dormant until proper conditions (such as the onset of spring or a rain period) trigger its fruiting phase. It germinates, forming one or several fruiting bodies with heads and stipes, variously coloured (resembling a tiny mushroom). In the head, threadlike sexual spores form, which are ejected simultaneously when suitable grass hosts are flowering.

Ergot infection causes a reduction in the yield and quality of grain and hay, and if livestock eat infected grain or hay it may cause a disease called ergotism. Black and protruding sclerotia of &quot;C. purpurea&quot; are well known. However, many tropical ergots have brown or greyish sclerotia, mimicking the shape of the host seed. For this reason, the infection is often overlooked.

Insects, including flies and moths, carry conidia of &quot;Claviceps&quot; species, but it is unknown whether insects play a role in spreading the fungus from infected to healthy plants.

==Evolution==
Regarding the evolution of plant parasitism in the Clavicipitaceae, an amber fossil discovered in 2020 preserves a grass spikelet and an ergot-like parasitic fungus. The fossil shows that the original hosts of the Clavicipitaceae could have been grasses. The discovery also establishes a minimum time for the conceivable presence of psychotropic compounds in fungi.
Several evolutionary processes have acted to diversify the array of ergot alkaloids produced by fungi; these differences in enzyme activities are evident at the levels of substrate specificity (LpsA), product specification (EasA, CloA) or both (EasG and possibly CloA). The &quot;old yellow enzyme&quot;, EasA, presents an outstanding example. This enzyme catalyzes reduction of the C8=C9 double-bond in chanoclavine I, but EasA isoforms differ in whether they subsequently catalyze reoxidation of C8–C9 after rotation. This difference distinguishes most Clavicipitaceae from Trichocomaceae, but in Clavicipitaceae it is also the key difference dividing the branch of classical ergot alkaloids from dihydroergot alkaloids, the latter often being preferred for pharmaceuticals due to their relatively few side effects.

==Effects on humans, other mammals and LSD==

The ergot sclerotium contains high concentrations (up to 2% of dry mass) of the alkaloid ergotamine, a complex molecule consisting of a tripeptide-derived cyclol-lactam ring connected via amide linkage to a lysergic acid (ergoline) moiety, and other alkaloids of the ergoline group that are biosynthesized by the fungus. Ergot alkaloids have a wide range of biological activities including effects on circulation and neurotransmission.

Ergot alkaloids are classified as:
# derivatives of 6,8-dimethylergoline and
# lysergic acid derivatives.

Ergotism is the name for sometimes severe pathological syndromes affecting humans or other animals that have ingested plant material containing ergot alkaloid, such as ergot-contaminated grains. 

The Hospital Brothers of St. Anthony, an order of monks established in 1095, specialized in treating ergotism victims with balms containing tranquilizing and circulation-stimulating plant extracts. The common name for ergotism is &quot;St. Anthony&#x27;s fire&quot;, in reference to this order of monks and the severe burning sensations in the limbs which was one of the symptoms. 

There are two types of ergotism. The first is characterized by muscle spasms, fever and hallucinations and the victims may appear dazed, be unable to speak, become manic, or have other forms of paralysis or tremors, and suffer from hallucinations and other distorted perceptions. This is caused by serotonergic stimulation of the central nervous system by some of the alkaloids. 

The second type of ergotism is marked by violent burning, absent peripheral pulses and shooting pain of the poorly vascularized distal organs, such as the fingers and toes, and are caused by effects of ergot alkaloids on the vascular system due to vasoconstriction, sometimes leading to gangrene and loss of limbs due to severely restricted blood circulation.

The neurotropic activities of the ergot alkaloids may also cause hallucinations and attendant irrational behaviour, convulsions, and even death. Other symptoms include strong uterine contractions, nausea, seizures, high fever, vomiting, loss of muscle strength and unconsciousness. 

Since the Middle Ages, controlled doses of ergot were used to induce abortions and to stop maternal bleeding after childbirth. 

Klotz offers a detailed overview of the toxicities in mammalian livestock, stating that the activities are attributable to antagonism or agonism of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine. He also states that the adrenergic blockage by ergopeptines (e.g., ergovaline or ergotamine) leads to potent and long-term vasoconstriction, and can result in reduced blood flow resulting in intense burning pain (St. Anthony&#x27;s fire), edema, cyanosis, dry gangrene and even loss of hooves in cattle or limbs in humans. Reduced prolactin due to ergot alkaloid activity on dopamine receptors in the pituitary is also common in livestock. Reduced serum prolactin is associated with various reproductive problems in cattle, and especially in horses, including agalactia and poor conception, and late-term losses of foals and sometimes mares due to dystocia and thickened placentas.
Although both gangrenous and convulsive symptoms are seen in naturally occurring ergotism resulting from the ingestion of fungus infected rye, only gangrenous ergotism has been reported following the excessive ingestion of ergotamine tartrate.

Ergot extract has been used in pharmaceutical preparations, including ergot alkaloids in products such as Cafergot (containing caffeine and ergotamine or ergoline) to treat migraine headaches, and ergometrine, used to induce uterine contractions and to control bleeding after childbirth. Clinical ergotism as seen today results almost exclusively from the excessive intake of ergotamine tartrate in the treatment of migraine headache.

In addition to ergot alkaloids, &quot;Claviceps paspali&quot; also produces tremorgens (paspalitrem) causing &quot;paspalum staggers&quot; in cattle. The fungi of the genera &quot;Penicillium&quot; and &quot;Aspergillus&quot; also produce ergot alkaloids, notably some isolates of the human pathogen &quot;Aspergillus fumigatus&quot;, and have been isolated from plants in the family Convolvulaceae, of which morning glory is best known. The causative agents of most ergot poisonings are the ergot alkaloid class of fungal metabolites, though some ergot fungi produce distantly related indole-diterpene alkaloids that are tremorgenic.

Ergot does not contain lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) but instead contains lysergic acid as well as its precursor, ergotamine. Lysergic acid is a precursor for the synthesis of LSD. Their realized and hypothesized medicinal uses have encouraged intensive research since the 1950s culminating on the one hand in development of drugs both legal (e.g., bromocriptine) and illegal (e.g., LSD), and on the other hand in extensive knowledge of the enzymes, genetics and diversity of ergot alkaloid biosynthetic pathways.

The January 4, 2007 issue of the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; includes a paper that documents a British study of more than 11,000 Parkinson&#x27;s disease patients. The study found that two ergot-derived drugs, pergolide and cabergoline, commonly used to treat Parkinson&#x27;s Disease may increase the risk of leaky heart valves by up to 700%.

==History==

Ergotism is the earliest recorded example of &quot;mycotoxicosis&quot;, or poisoning caused by toxic molds.
Early references to ergotism date back as far as 600 BC, an Assyrian tablet referred to it as a &quot;noxious pustule in the ear of grain.&quot; In 350 BC, the Parsees described &quot;noxious grasses that cause pregnant women to drop the womb and die in childbed.&quot; In ancient Syria, ergot was called &quot;Daughter of Blood.&quot; Radulf Glaber described an ailment he called &quot;hidden fire,&quot; or &quot;ignus ocultus&quot;, in which a burning of the limb is followed by its separation from the body, often consuming the victim in one night. In 1588, Johannes Thallius wrote that it is called &quot;Mother of Rye,&quot; or &quot;rockenmutter,&quot; and is used to halt bleeding.

Human poisoning due to the consumption of rye bread made from ergot-infected grain was common in Europe in the Middle Ages. The first mention of a plague of gangrenous ergotism in Europe comes from Germany in 857; following this, France and Scandinavia experienced similar outbreaks; England is noticeably absent from the historical regions affected by ergotism as its main source of food was wheat, which is resistant to ergot fungi. In 994, a massive outbreak potentially attributed to ergotism caused 40,000 deaths in the regions of Aquitaine, Limousin, Périgord and Angoumois in France. In Hesse, in 1596, Wendelin Thelius was one of the first to attribute ergotism poisoning to grain. In 1778, S. Tessier, observing a huge epidemic in Sologne, France, in which more than 8,000 people died, recommended drainage of fields, compulsory cleaning of grain, and the substitution of potatoes for affected grain.

In 1722, the Russian Tsar Peter the Great was thwarted in his campaign against the Ottoman Empire as his army, traveling down the Terek steppe, was struck by ergotism and was forced to retreat in order to find edible grains. A diary entry from the time notes that as soon as people ate the poisoned bread, they became dizzy, with such strong nerve contractions that those who did not die on the first day found their hands and feet falling off, akin to frostbite. The outbreak was known as Saint Anthony&#x27;s fire, or &quot;ignis sacer&quot;. 

Some historical events, such as the Great Fear in France at the outset of the French Revolution, have been linked to ergot poisoning. 

===Saint Anthony&#x27;s fire and the Antonites===
Saint Anthony was a 3rd Century Egyptian ascetic who lived by the Red Sea and was known for long fasting in which he confronted terrible visions and temptations sent from the Devil. He was credited by two noblemen for assisting them in recovery from the disease; they subsequently founded the Order of St. Anthony in his honor. Anthony was a popular subject for art in the Middle Ages, and his symbol is a large blue &quot;T&quot; sewn onto the shoulder of the order&#x27;s monks, symbolizing the crutch used by the ill and injured.

The Order of St. Anthony, whose members were known as Antonites, grew quickly, and hospitals spread through France, Germany and Scandinavia and gained wealth and power as grateful patrons bestowed money and charitable goods on the hospitals. By the end of the Middle Ages, there were 396 settlements and 372 hospitals owned by the order, and pilgrimages to such hospitals became popular, as well as the donation of limbs lost to ergotism, which were displayed near shrines to the saint. These hagiotherapeutic centers were the first specialized European medical welfare systems, and the friars of the order were knowledgeable about treatment of ergotism and the horrifying effects of the poison. The sufferers would receive ergot-free meals, wines containing vasodilating and analgesic herbs, and applications of Antonites-balsam, which was the first transdermal therapeutic system (TTS) in medical history. These medical recipes have been lost to time, though some recorded treatments still remain. After 1130, the monks were no longer permitted to perform operations, and so barber surgeons were employed to remove gangrenous limbs and treat open sores. Three barbers founded a hospital in Memmingen in 1214 and accepted those who were afflicted with the gangrenous form of ergotism. Patients were fed and housed, with the more able-bodied individuals acting as orderlies and assistants. Patients with the convulsive form of ergotism, or &quot;ergotismus convulsivus&quot;, were welcomed for only nine days before they were asked to leave, as convulsive ergotism was seen as less detrimental. Though the sufferers often experienced irreversible effects, they most often returned to their families and resumed their livelihoods.

An important aspect to the Order of St. Anthony&#x27;s treatment practices was the exclusion of rye bread and other ergot-containing edibles, which halted the progression of ergotism. There was no known cure for ergotism itself; however, there was treatment of the symptoms, which often included blood constriction, nervous disorders and/or hallucinations; if the sufferer survived the initial poisoning, his limbs would often fall off, and he or she would continue to improve in health if he or she halted consumption of ergot. The trunk of the body remained relatively untouched by the disease until its final stages, and the victims, not understanding the cause of their ailment, would continue to imbibe ergot-laden food for weeks until the condition reached their digestive system. It is believed that the peasantry and children were most susceptible to ergotism, though the wealthy were afflicted as well, as, at times, entire villages relied on tainted crops for sustenance, and during times of famine, ergotism reached into every house. Ergot fungus is impervious to heat and water, and thus it was most often baked into bread through rye flour; though other grasses can be infected, it was uncommon in Medieval Europe to consume grasses other than rye. The physiological effects of ergot depended on the concentration and combinations of the ingested ergot metabolites, as well as the age and nutritional status of the afflicted individual. The Antonites began to decline after physicians discovered the genesis of ergotism and recommended methods for removing the sclerotium from the rye crops. In 1776, the cloisters of the Antonites were incorporated into the Maltese Knights Hospitaller, losing much of their medical histories in the process and losing the ergotism cures and recipes due to lack of use and lack of preservation.

===Usage in gynaecology and obstetrics===
Midwives and very few doctors in Europe have used extracts from ergot for centuries: 
# In a Nürnberg manuscript of 1474, powdered ergot was prescribed together with Laurel-fruits and rhizomes of Solomon&#x27;s seals to cure &quot;permutter&quot; or &quot;heffmutter,&quot; which refers to pain in the lower abdomen caused by &#x27;uprising of the womb&#x27;
# In a printed book of 1582, the German physician Adam Lonicer wrote, that three sclerotia of ergot, used several times a day, were used by midwives as a good remedy in case of the &quot;uprising and pain of the womb&quot; (&quot;auffſteigen vnd wehethumb der mutter&quot;)
# Joachim Camerarius the Younger wrote in 1586, that sclerotia of ergot held under the tongue, would stop bleeding

To prove that ergot is a harmless sort of grain, in 1774, the French pharmacist Antoine-Augustin Parmentier edited a letter he had received from Madame Dupile, a midwife of Chaumont-en-Vexin. She had told him that if uterine contractions were too weak in the expulsion stage of childbirth, she and her mother gave peeled ergot in an amount of the filling of a thimble dispersed in water, wine or broth. The administration of ergot was followed by a mild childbirth within 15 minutes. The French physician Jean-Baptiste Desgranges (1751–1831) published in 1818, that in 1777 he had met midwives in Lyon, who successfully treated feeble uterine contractions by administering the powder of ergot. Desgranges added this remedy to his therapeutic arsenal. From 1777 to 1804, he was successful in alleviating childbirth for more than twenty women by the administration of the powder of ergot. He never saw any side-effect of this treatment.

In the United States, in 1807 Dr. John Stearns of Saratoga County, New York wrote to a friend that he had used, over several years, a &quot;pulvis parturiens&quot; with complete success in patients with &quot;lingering parturitation&quot;. This &quot;pulvis parturiens&quot; consisted of ergot, that he called a &quot;spurious groth of rye&quot;. He boiled &quot;half a drachm&quot; (ca. 2g) of that powder in half a pint of water and gave one third every twenty minutes, till the pains commenced. In 1813, Dr. Oliver Prescott (1762–1827) of Newburyport, Massachusetts published a dissertation &quot;on the natural history and medical effects of the secale cornutum&quot;, in which he described and analysed the experience he had gathered over five years while using ergot in cases of poor uterine action in the second stage of labour in childbirth.

The 1836 &quot;Dispensatory of the United States&quot; recommended &quot;to a woman in labour fifteen or twenty grains [ca. 1 to 1.3g] of ergot in powder to be repeated every twenty minutes, till its peculiar effects are experienced, or till the amount of a drachm [ca. 3.9g] has been taken&quot;.

In 1837, the French &quot;Codex Pharmacopee Francaise&quot; required ergot to be kept in all pharmacies.

Low to very low evidence from clinical trials suggests that prophylactic use of ergot alkaloids, administered by intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) in the third stage of labor, may reduce blood loss and may reduce the risk of moderate to severe hemorrhage following delivery, however this medication may also be associated with higher blood pressure and higher pain. It is not clear if oral ergot alkaloids are beneficial or harmful as they have not been well studied. A 2018 Cochrane Systematic Review concluded that other medications such as oxytocin, syntometrine and prostaglandins, may be preferred over ergot alkaloids.

Though ergot was known to cause abortions in cattle and humans, this was not a recognized use for it as abortion was illegal in most countries, thus evidence for its use in abortion is unknown. Most often, ergot was used to speed the process of parturition or delivery, and was not used for the purpose of halting postpartum bleeding, which is a concern of childbirth. However, until anesthesia became available, there was no antidote or way of controlling the effects of ergot. So if the fetus did not move as expected, the drug could cause the uterus to mold itself around the child, rupturing the uterus and killing the child. David Hosack, an American physician, noted the large number of stillbirths resulting from ergot use and stated that rather than &quot;pulvis ad partum&quot;, it should be called &quot;pulvis ad mortem&quot;. He began advocating for its use to halt postpartum bleeding. Eventually, doctors determined that the use of ergot in childbirth without an antidote was too dangerous. They ultimately restricted its use to expelling the placenta or stopping hemorrhage. Not only did it constrict the uterus, ergot had the ability to increase or decrease blood pressure, induce hypothermia and emesis, and influence pituitary hormone secretions. In 1926, Swiss psychiatrist Hans Maier suggested to use ergotamine for the treatment of vascular headaches of the migraine type.

In the 1930s, abortifacient drugs were marketed to women by various companies under various names such as Molex pills and Cote pills. Since birth control devices and abortifacients were illegal to market and sell at the time, they were offered to women who were &quot;delayed&quot;. The recommended dosage was seven grains of ergotin a day. According to the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) these pills contained ergotin, aloes, Black Hellebore and other substances. The efficacy and safety of these pills are unknown. The FTC deemed them unsafe and ineffective and demanded that they cease and desist selling the product. Currently, over a thousand compounds have been derived from ergot ingredients.

===Speculated cause of hysterics and hallucinations===
It has been posited that Kykeon, the beverage consumed by participants in the ancient Greek Eleusinian Mysteries cult, might have been based on hallucinogens from ergotamine, a precursor to the potent hallucinogen LSD, and ergonovine.

An article appearing in the July 23, 1881 edition of &quot;Scientific American&quot; entitled &quot;A New Exhilarating Substance&quot; denotes cases of euphoria upon consuming tincture of ergot of rye, particularly when mixed with phosphate of soda and sweetened water. In rainy years, it was thought rye bread exceeded 5% ergot.

British author John Grigsby contends that the presence of ergot in the stomachs of some of the so-called &#x27;bog-bodies&#x27; (Iron Age human remains from peat bogs of northeast Europe, such as the Tollund Man) is indicative of use of &quot;Claviceps purpurea&quot; in ritual drinks in a prehistoric fertility cult akin to the Greek Eleusinian Mysteries. In his 2005 book &quot;Beowulf and Grendel&quot;, he argues that the Anglo-Saxon poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; is based on a memory of the quelling of this fertility cult by followers of Odin. He writes that Beowulf, which he translates as &quot;barley-wolf&quot;, suggests a connection to ergot which in German was known as the &#x27;tooth of the wolf&#x27;.

Linnda R. Caporael posited in 1976 that the hysterical symptoms of young women that had spurred the Salem witch trials had been the result of consuming ergot-tainted rye. However, Nicholas P. Spanos and Jack Gottlieb, after a review of the historical and medical evidence, later disputed her conclusions. Other authors have likewise cast doubt on ergotism as the cause of the Salem witch trials.

==&quot;Claviceps purpurea&quot;==

Mankind has known about &quot;Claviceps purpurea&quot; for a long time, and its appearance has been linked to extremely cold winters that were followed by rainy summers.

The sclerotial stage of &quot;C. purpurea&quot; conspicuous on the heads of ryes and other such grains is known as ergot. Favorable temperatures for growth are in the range of 18–30 °C. Temperatures above 37 °C cause rapid germination of conidia. Sunlight has a chromogenic effect on the mycelium, with intense coloration. Cereal mashes and sprouted rye are suitable substrates for growth of the fungus in the laboratory.

==&quot;Claviceps africana&quot;==
&quot;Claviceps africana&quot; infects sorghum. In sorghum and pearl millet, ergot became a problem when growers adopted hybrid technology, which increased host susceptibility. It only infects unfertilized ovaries, so self-pollination and fertilization can decrease the presence of the disease, but male-sterile lines are extremely vulnerable to infection. Symptoms of infection by &quot;C. africana&quot; include the secretion of honeydew (a fluid with high concentrates of sugar and conidia), which attracts insects like flies, beetles and wasps that feed on it. This helps spread the fungus to uninfected plants.

In Sorghum, this honeydew can be spotted coming out of head flowers. A whitish sticky substance can also be observed on leaves and on the ground.

&quot;C. africana&quot; caused ergot disease that caused a famine in 1903–1906 in northern Cameroon, West Africa, and also occurs in eastern and southern Africa, especially Zimbabwe and South Africa. Male sterile sorghums (also referred to as A-lines) are especially susceptible to infection, as first recognized in the 1960s, and massive losses in seed yield have been noted. Infection is associated with cold night temperatures that are below 12 °C occurring two to three weeks before flowering.

Sorghum ergot caused by &quot;Claviceps africana&quot; Frederickson, Mantle and De Milliano is widespread in all sorghum-growing areas, whereas the species was formerly restricted to Africa and Asia where it was first recorded more than 90 years ago, it has been spreading rapidly and by the mid-1990s it reached Brazil, South Africa and Australia. By 1997, the disease had spread to most South American countries and the Caribbean including Mexico, and by 1997 had reached Texas in the United States.

=== Management ===
Partners of the CABI-led programme, Plantwise (including the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock in Zambia) have several recommendations for managing the spread of ergot, these include; planting tolerant varieties, disk fields after harvest to prevent sorghum ratoon and volunteer plants from developing, remove any infected plants, and carrying out three-year crop rotations with legumes.

== &quot;Claviceps paspali&quot; ==
&quot;Claviceps paspali&quot; infects wild grasses and could be found on the common grass Paspalum. Like the &quot;C. africana&quot;, &quot;C. paspali&quot; also secretes honeydew which is consumed by bees. The bees then create a honey called fic&#x27;e (Paraguayan Makai Indian language), which is infused with secretions from the plants and has a pungent aroma. If consumed in high amounts, the honey can cause drunkenness, dizziness and even death.

<text>Groundwater is the water present beneath Earth&#x27;s surface in rock and soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations. About 30 percent of all readily available fresh water in the world is groundwater. A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an &quot;aquifer&quot; when it can yield a usable quantity of water. The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the &quot;water table&quot;. Groundwater is recharged from the surface; it may discharge from the surface naturally at springs and seeps, and can form oases or wetlands. Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is &quot;hydrogeology&quot;, also called groundwater hydrology.

Typically, groundwater is thought of as water flowing through shallow aquifers, but, in the technical sense, it can also contain soil moisture, permafrost (frozen soil), immobile water in very low permeability bedrock, and deep geothermal or oil formation water. Groundwater is hypothesized to provide lubrication that can possibly influence the movement of faults. It is likely that much of Earth&#x27;s subsurface contains some water, which may be mixed with other fluids in some instances. 

Groundwater is often cheaper, more convenient and less vulnerable to pollution than surface water. Therefore, it is commonly used for public drinking water supplies. For example, groundwater provides the largest source of usable water storage in the United States, and California annually withdraws the largest amount of groundwater of all the states. Underground reservoirs contain far more water than the capacity of all surface reservoirs and lakes in the US, including the Great Lakes. Many municipal water supplies are derived solely from groundwater. Over 2 billion people rely on it as their primary water source worldwide.

Human use of groundwater causes environmental problems. For example, polluted groundwater is less visible and more difficult to clean up than pollution in rivers and lakes. Groundwater pollution most often results from improper disposal of wastes on land. Major sources include industrial and household chemicals and garbage landfills, excessive fertilizers and pesticides used in agriculture, industrial waste lagoons, tailings and process wastewater from mines, industrial fracking, oil field brine pits, leaking underground oil storage tanks and pipelines, sewage sludge and septic systems. Additionally, groundwater is susceptible to saltwater intrusion in coastal areas and can cause land subsidence when extracted unsustainably, leading to sinking cities (like Bangkok) and loss in elevation (such as the multiple meters lost in the Central Valley of California). These issues are made more complicated by sea level rise and other effects of climate change, particularly those on the water cycle. Earth&#x27;s axial tilt has shifted 31 inches because of human groundwater pumping.

== Definition ==
Groundwater is fresh water located in the subsurface pore space of soil and rocks. It is also water that is flowing within aquifers below the water table. Sometimes it is useful to make a distinction between groundwater that is closely associated with surface water, and deep groundwater in an aquifer (called &quot;fossil water&quot; if it infiltrated into the ground millennia ago).

== Role in the water cycle ==


Groundwater can be thought of in the same terms as surface water: inputs, outputs and storage. The natural input to groundwater is seepage from surface water. The natural outputs from groundwater are springs and seepage to the oceans. Due to its slow rate of turnover, groundwater storage is generally much larger (in volume) compared to inputs than it is for surface water. This difference makes it easy for humans to use groundwater unsustainably for a long time without severe consequences. Nevertheless, over the long term the average rate of seepage above a groundwater source is the upper bound for average consumption of water from that source.

Groundwater is naturally replenished by surface water from precipitation, streams, and rivers when this recharge reaches the water table.

Groundwater can be a long-term &#x27;reservoir&#x27; of the natural water cycle (with residence times from days to millennia), as opposed to short-term water reservoirs like the atmosphere and fresh surface water (which have residence times from minutes to years). Deep groundwater (which is quite distant from the surface recharge) can take a very long time to complete its natural cycle.

The Great Artesian Basin in central and eastern Australia is one of the largest confined aquifer systems in the world, extending for almost 2 million km2. By analysing the trace elements in water sourced from deep underground, hydrogeologists have been able to determine that water extracted from these aquifers can be more than 1 million years old.

By comparing the age of groundwater obtained from different parts of the Great Artesian Basin, hydrogeologists have found it increases in age across the basin. Where water recharges the aquifers along the Eastern Divide, ages are young. As groundwater flows westward across the continent, it increases in age, with the oldest groundwater occurring in the western parts. This means that in order to have travelled almost 1000 km from the source of recharge in 1 million years, the groundwater flowing through the Great Artesian Basin travels at an average rate of about 1 metre per year.

=== Location in aquifers ===
==Characteristics==
=== Temperature ===

The high specific heat capacity of water and the insulating effect of soil and rock can mitigate the effects of climate and maintain groundwater at a relatively steady temperature. In some places where groundwater temperatures are maintained by this effect at about , groundwater can be used for controlling the temperature inside structures at the surface. For example, during hot weather relatively cool groundwater can be pumped through radiators in a home and then returned to the ground in another well. During cold seasons, because it is relatively warm, the water can be used in the same way as a source of heat for heat pumps that is much more efficient than using air.

=== Availability ===
Groundwater makes up about thirty percent of the world&#x27;s fresh water supply, which is about 0.76% of the entire world&#x27;s water, including oceans and permanent ice. About 99% of the world&#x27;s liquid fresh water is groundwater. Global groundwater storage is roughly equal to the total amount of freshwater stored in the snow and ice pack, including the north and south poles. This makes it an important resource that can act as a natural storage that can buffer against shortages of surface water, as in during times of drought.

The volume of groundwater in an aquifer can be estimated by measuring water levels in local wells and by examining geologic records from well-drilling to determine the extent, depth and thickness of water-bearing sediments and rocks. Before an investment is made in production wells, test wells may be drilled to measure the depths at which water is encountered and collect samples of soils, rock and water for laboratory analyses. Pumping tests can be performed in test wells to determine flow characteristics of the aquifer.

The characteristics of aquifers vary with the geology and structure of the substrate and topography in which they occur. In general, the more productive aquifers occur in sedimentary geologic formations. By comparison, weathered and fractured crystalline rocks yield smaller quantities of groundwater in many environments. Unconsolidated to poorly cemented alluvial materials that have accumulated as valley-filling sediments in major river valleys and geologically subsiding structural basins are included among the most productive sources of groundwater.

Fluid flows can be altered in different lithological settings by brittle deformation of rocks in fault zones; the mechanisms by which this occurs are the subject of fault zone hydrogeology.

== Uses by humans ==
Reliance on groundwater will only increase, mainly due to growing water demand by all sectors combined with increasing variation in rainfall patterns. Safe use of groundwater varies substantially by the elements present and use-cases, with significant differences between consumption for humans, livestocks and different crops.

=== Quantities ===
Groundwater is the most accessed source of freshwater around the world, including as drinking water, irrigation, and manufacturing. Groundwater accounts for about half of the world&#x27;s drinking water, 40% of its irrigation water, and a third of water for industrial purposes. 

Another estimate stated that globally groundwater accounts for about one third of all water withdrawals, and surface water for the other two thirds. Groundwater provides drinking water to at least 50% of the global population. About 2.5 billion people depend solely on groundwater resources to satisfy their basic daily water needs.

A similar estimate was published in 2021 which stated that &quot;groundwater is estimated to supply between a quarter and a third of the world&#x27;s annual freshwater withdrawals to meet agricultural, industrial and domestic demands.&quot;

Global freshwater withdrawal was probably around 600 km3 per year in 1900 and increased to 3,880 km3 per year in 2017. The rate of increase was especially high (around 3% per year) during the period 1950–1980, partly due to a higher population growth rate, and partly to rapidly increasing groundwater development, particularly for irrigation. The rate of increase is (as per 2022) approximately 1% per year, in tune with the current population growth rate.

Global groundwater depletion has been calculated to be between 100 and 300 km3 per year. This depletion is mainly caused by &quot;expansion of irrigated agriculture in drylands&quot;. 

The Asia-Pacific region is the largest groundwater abstractor in the world, containing seven out of the ten countries that extract most groundwater (Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan and Turkey). These countries alone account for roughly 60% of the world&#x27;s total groundwater withdrawal.

=== Drinking water quality aspects ===

Groundwater may or may not be a safe water source. In fact, there is considerable uncertainty with groundwater in different hydrogeologic contexts: the widespread presence of contaminants such as arsenic, fluoride and salinity can reduce the suitability of groundwater as a drinking water source. Arsenic and fluoride have been considered as &quot;priority contaminants&quot; at a global level, although priority chemicals will vary by country. 

There is a lot of heterogeneity of hydrogeologic properties. For this reason, salinity of groundwater is often highly variable over space. This contributes to highly variable groundwater security risks even within a specific region. Salinity in groundwater makes the water unpalatable and unusable and is often the worst in coastal areas, especially due to Saltwater intrusion from excessive use, which are notable in Bangladesh, and East and West India, and many islan nations.

Due to climate change groundwater is warming. The temperature of Viennese groundwater has increased by .9 degrees Celsius between 2001 and 2010; by 1.4 degrees between 2011 and 2020. In a joint research project scientists at the Karlsruher Institut für Technologie and the University of Vienna have tried to quantify the amount of drinking water loss to be expected due to ground water warming up to the end of the current century. Stressing the fact that regional shallow groundwater warming patterns vary substantially due to spatial variability in climate change and water table depth these researchers write that we currently lack knowledge about how groundwater responds to surface warming across spatial and temporal scales. Their study shows, however, that following a medium emissions pathway, in 2100 between 77 million and 188 million people are projected to live in areas where groundwater exceeds the highest threshold for drinking water temperatures (DWTs) set by any country.

=== Water supply for municipal and industrial uses ===

Municipal and industrial water supplies are provided through large wells. Multiple wells for one water supply source are termed &quot;wellfields&quot;, which may withdraw water from confined or unconfined aquifers. Using groundwater from deep, confined aquifers provides more protection from surface water contamination. Some wells, termed &quot;collector wells&quot;, are specifically designed to induce infiltration of surface (usually river) water. 

Aquifers that provide sustainable fresh groundwater to urban areas and for agricultural irrigation are typically close to the ground surface (within a couple of hundred metres) and have some recharge by fresh water. This recharge is typically from rivers or meteoric water (precipitation) that percolates into the aquifer through overlying unsaturated materials. In cases where the groundwater has unacceptable levels of salinity or specific ions, desalination is a common treatment. However, for the brine, safe disposal or reuse is needed.

=== Irrigation ===

In general, the irrigation of 20% of farming land (with various types of water sources) accounts for the production of 40% of food production. Irrigation techniques across the globe includes canals redirecting surface water, groundwater pumping, and diverting water from dams. Aquifers are critically important in agriculture. Deep aquifers in arid areas have long been water sources for irrigation. A majority of extracted groundwater, 70%, is used for agricultural purposes. Significant investigation has gone into determining safe levels of specific salts present for different agricultural uses. 

In India, 65% of the irrigation is from groundwater and about 90% of extracted groundwater is used for irrigation. 

Occasionally, sedimentary or &quot;fossil&quot; aquifers are used to provide irrigation and drinking water to urban areas. In Libya, for example, Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s Great Manmade River project has pumped large amounts of groundwater from aquifers beneath the Sahara to populous areas near the coast. Though this has saved Libya money over the alternative, seawater desalination, the aquifers are likely to run dry in 60 to 100 years. 

=== In developing countries ===
== Challenges ==
First, flood mitigation schemes, intended to protect infrastructure built on floodplains, have had the unintended consequence of reducing aquifer recharge associated with natural flooding. Second, prolonged depletion of groundwater in extensive aquifers can result in land subsidence, with associated infrastructure damageas well as, third, saline intrusion. Fourth, draining acid sulphate soils, often found in low-lying coastal plains, can result in acidification and pollution of formerly freshwater and estuarine streams.

=== Overdraft ===

Groundwater is a highly useful and often abundant resource. Most land areas on Earth have some form of aquifer underlying them, sometimes at significant depths. In some cases, these aquifers are rapidly being depleted by the human population. Such over-use, over-abstraction or overdraft can cause major problems to human users and to the environment. The most evident problem (as far as human groundwater use is concerned) is a lowering of the water table beyond the reach of existing wells. As a consequence, wells must be drilled deeper to reach the groundwater; in some places (e.g., California, Texas, and India) the water table has dropped hundreds of feet because of extensive well pumping. The GRACE satellites have collected data that demonstrates 21 of Earth&#x27;s 37 major aquifers are undergoing depletion. In the Punjab region of India, for example, groundwater levels have dropped 10 meters since 1979, and the rate of depletion is accelerating. A lowered water table may, in turn, cause other problems such as groundwater-related subsidence and saltwater intrusion.

Another cause for concern is that groundwater drawdown from over-allocated aquifers has the potential to cause severe damage to both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystemsin some cases very conspicuously but in others quite imperceptibly because of the extended period over which the damage occurs. The importance of groundwater to ecosystems is often overlooked, even by freshwater biologists and ecologists. Groundwaters sustain rivers, wetlands, and lakes, as well as subterranean ecosystems within karst or alluvial aquifers.

Not all ecosystems need groundwater, of course. Some terrestrial ecosystemsfor example, those of the open deserts and similar arid environmentsexist on irregular rainfall and the moisture it delivers to the soil, supplemented by moisture in the air. While there are other terrestrial ecosystems in more hospitable environments where groundwater plays no central role, groundwater is in fact fundamental to many of the world&#x27;s major ecosystems. Water flows between groundwaters and surface waters. Most rivers, lakes, and wetlands are fed by, and (at other places or times) feed groundwater, to varying degrees. Groundwater feeds soil moisture through percolation, and many terrestrial vegetation communities depend directly on either groundwater or the percolated soil moisture above the aquifer for at least part of each year. Hyporheic zones (the mixing zone of streamwater and groundwater) and riparian zones are examples of ecotones largely or totally dependent on groundwater.

A 2021 study found that of ~39 million investigated groundwater wells 6-20% are at high risk of running dry if local groundwater levels decline by a few meters, oras with many areas and possibly more than half of major aquiferscontinue to decline.

Fresh-water aquifers, especially those with limited recharge by snow or rain, also known as meteoric water, can be over-exploited and depending on the local hydrogeology, may draw in non-potable water or saltwater intrusion from hydraulically connected aquifers or surface water bodies. This can be a serious problem, especially in coastal areas and other areas where aquifer pumping is excessive.

===Subsidence===
Subsidence occurs when too much water is pumped out from underground, deflating the space below the above-surface, and thus causing the ground to collapse. The result can look like craters on plots of land. This occurs because, in its natural equilibrium state, the hydraulic pressure of groundwater in the pore spaces of the aquifer and the aquitard supports some of the weight of the overlying sediments. When groundwater is removed from aquifers by excessive pumping, pore pressures in the aquifer drop and compression of the aquifer may occur. This compression may be partially recoverable if pressures rebound, but much of it is not. When the aquifer gets compressed, it may cause land subsidence, a drop in the ground surface.

In unconsolidated aquifers, groundwater is produced from pore spaces between particles of gravel, sand, and silt. If the aquifer is confined by low-permeability layers, the reduced water pressure in the sand and gravel causes slow drainage of water from the adjoining confining layers. If these confining layers are composed of compressible silt or clay, the loss of water to the aquifer reduces the water pressure in the confining layer, causing it to compress from the weight of overlying geologic materials. In severe cases, this compression can be observed on the ground surface as subsidence. Unfortunately, much of the subsidence from groundwater extraction is permanent (elastic rebound is small). Thus, the subsidence is not only permanent, but the compressed aquifer has a permanently reduced capacity to hold water.

The city of New Orleans, Louisiana is actually below sea level today, and its subsidence is partly caused by removal of groundwater from the various aquifer/aquitard systems beneath it. In the first half of the 20th century, the San Joaquin Valley experienced significant subsidence, in some places up to due to groundwater removal. Cities on river deltas, including Venice in Italy, and Bangkok in Thailand, have experienced surface subsidence; Mexico City, built on a former lake bed, has experienced rates of subsidence of up to per year.

For coastal cities, subsidence can increase the risk of other environmental issues, such as sea level rise. For example, Bangkok is expected to have 5.138 million people exposed to coastal flooding by 2070 because of these combining factors.

=== Groundwater becoming saline due to evaporation ===
If the surface water source is also subject to substantial evaporation, a groundwater source may become saline. This situation can occur naturally under endorheic bodies of water, or artificially under irrigated farmland. In coastal areas, human use of a groundwater source may cause the direction of seepage to ocean to reverse which can also cause soil salinization. 

As water moves through the landscape, it collects soluble salts, mainly sodium chloride. Where such water enters the atmosphere through evapotranspiration, these salts are left behind. In irrigation districts, poor drainage of soils and surface aquifers can result in water tables&#x27; coming to the surface in low-lying areas. Major land degradation problems of soil salinity and waterlogging result, combined with increasing levels of salt in surface waters. As a consequence, major damage has occurred to local economies and environments. 

Aquifers in surface irrigated areas in semi-arid zones with reuse of the unavoidable irrigation water losses percolating down into the underground by supplemental irrigation from wells run the risk of salination.

Surface irrigation water normally contains salts in the order of or more and the annual irrigation requirement is in the order of or more so the annual import of salt is in the order of or more.

Under the influence of continuous evaporation, the salt concentration of the aquifer water may increase continually and eventually cause an environmental problem.

For salinity control in such a case, annually an amount of drainage water is to be discharged from the aquifer by means of a subsurface drainage system and disposed of through a safe outlet. The drainage system may be &quot;horizontal&quot; (i.e. using pipes, tile drains or ditches) or &quot;vertical&quot; (drainage by wells). To estimate the drainage requirement, the use of a groundwater model with an agro-hydro-salinity component may be instrumental, e.g. SahysMod.

=== Seawater intrusion ===

Aquifers near the coast have a lens of freshwater near the surface and denser seawater under freshwater. Seawater penetrates the aquifer diffusing in from the ocean and is denser than freshwater. For porous (i.e., sandy) aquifers near the coast, the thickness of freshwater atop saltwater is about for every of freshwater head above sea level. This relationship is called the Ghyben-Herzberg equation. If too much groundwater is pumped near the coast, salt-water may intrude into freshwater aquifers causing contamination of potable freshwater supplies. Many coastal aquifers, such as the Biscayne Aquifer near Miami and the New Jersey Coastal Plain aquifer, have problems with saltwater intrusion as a result of overpumping and sea level rise.

Seawater intrusion is the flow or presence of seawater into coastal aquifers; it is a case of saltwater intrusion. It is a natural phenomenon but can also be caused or worsened by anthropogenic factors, such as sea level rise due to climate change. In the case of homogeneous aquifers, seawater intrusion forms a saline wedge below a transition zone to fresh groundwater, flowing seaward on the top. These changes can have other effects on the land above the groundwater. For example, coastal groundwater in California would rise in many aquifers, increasing risks of flooding and runoff challenges.

Sea level rise causes the mixing of sea water into the coastal groundwater, rendering it unusable once it amounts to more than 2-3% of the reservoir. Along an estimated 15% of the US coastline, the majority of local groundwater levels are already below the sea level.

=== Pollution ===

=== Climate change ===
The impacts of climate change on groundwater may be greatest through its indirect effects on irrigation water demand via increased evapotranspiration. There is an observed declined in groundwater storage in many parts of the world. This is due to more groundwater being used for irrigation activities in agriculture, particularly in drylands. Some of this increase in irrigation can be due to water scarcity issues made worse by effects of climate change on the water cycle. Direct redistribution of water by human activities amounting to ~24,000 km3 per year is about double the global groundwater recharge each year.

Climate change causes changes to the water cycle which in turn affect groundwater in several ways: There can be a decline in groundwater storage, and reduction in groundwater recharge and water quality deterioration due to extreme weather events. In the tropics intense precipitation and flooding events appear to lead to more groundwater recharge. 

However, the exact impacts of climate change on groundwater are still under investigation. This is because scientific data derived from groundwater monitoring is still missing, such as changes in space and time, abstraction data and &quot;numerical representations of groundwater recharge processes&quot;.

Effects of climate change could have different impacts on groundwater storage: The expected more intense (but fewer) major rainfall events could lead to &quot;increased&quot; groundwater recharge in many environments. But more intense drought periods could result in soil drying-out and compaction which would &quot;reduce&quot; infiltration to groundwater.

For the higher altitudes regions, the reduced duration and amount of snow may lead to reduced recharge of groundwater in spring. The impacts of receding alpine glaciers on groundwater systems are not well understood. 

Global sea level rise due to climate change has induced seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers around the world, particularly in low-lying areas and small islands. However, groundwater abstraction is usually the main reason for seawater intrusion, rather than sea level rise (see in section on seawater intrusion). Seawater intrusion threatens coastal ecosystems and livelihood resilience. Bangladesh is a vulnerable country for this issue, and mangrove forest of Sundarbans is a vulnerable ecosystem.

Groundwater pollution may also increase indirectly due to climate change: More frequent and intense storms can pollute groundwater by mobilizing contaminants, for example fertilizers, wastewater or human excreta from pit latrines. Droughts reduce river dilution capacities and groundwater levels, increasing the risk of groundwater contamination.

==== Climate change adaptation ====
Using more groundwater, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, is seen as a method for climate change adaptation in the case that climate change causes more intense or frequent droughts.

Groundwater-based adaptations to climate change exploit distributed groundwater storage and the capacity of aquifer systems to store seasonal or episodic water surpluses. They incur substantially lower evaporative losses than conventional infrastructure, such as surface dams. For example, in tropical Africa, pumping water from groundwater storage can help to improve the climate resilience of water and food supplies.

==== Climate change mitigation ====
The development of geothermal energy, a sustainable energy source, plays an important role in reducing CO2 emissions and thus mitigating climate change. Groundwater is an agent in the storage, movement, and extraction of geothermal energy. 

In pioneering nations, such as the Netherlands and Sweden, the ground/groundwater is increasingly seen as just one component (a seasonal source, sink or thermal &#x27;buffer&#x27;) in district heating and cooling networks. 

Deep aquifers can also be used for carbon capture and sequestration, the process of storing carbon to curb accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

== Groundwater governance ==
Groundwater governance processes enable groundwater management, planning and policy implementation. It takes place at multiple scales and geographic levels, including regional and transboundary scales. 

Groundwater management is action-oriented, focusing on practical implementation activities and day-to-day operations. Because groundwater is often perceived as a private resource (that is, closely connected to land ownership, and in some jurisdictions treated as privately owned), regulation and top–down governance and management are difficult. Governments need to fully assume their role as resource custodians in view of the common-good aspects of groundwater. 

Domestic laws and regulations regulate access to groundwater as well as human activities that impact the quality of groundwater. Legal frameworks also need to include protection of discharge and recharge zones and of the area surrounding water supply wells, as well as sustainable yield norms and abstraction controls, and conjunctive use regulations. In some jurisdictions, groundwater is regulated in conjunction with surface water, including rivers.

==By country==
Groundwater is an important water resource for the supply of drinking water, especially in arid countries.

The Arab region is one of the most water-scarce in the world and groundwater is the most relied-upon water source in at least 11 of the 22 Arab states. Over-extraction of groundwater in many parts of the region has led to groundwater table declines, especially in highly populated and agricultural areas.

<text>&quot;Daddy Wouldn’t Buy Me a Bow Wow&quot; is a song written in 1892 by prolific English songwriter Joseph Tabrar.

It was written for, and first performed in 1892 by, Vesta Victoria at the South London Palace, holding a kitten. The same year it was recorded by Silas Leachman for the North American Phonograph Co. of Chicago (Talking Machine Company of Chicago/Chicago Talking Machine). In 1895 Toulouse-Lautrec painted May Belfort singing it. The comedian Arthur Roberts also had success in the 1890s with the song.

The song featured in the 1934 musical movie &quot;Evergreen&quot;, sung by Jessie Matthews, and was also revived after World War II.

The chorus was sung by Helen Mirren and Peter Sellers in the 1980 movie &quot;The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu&quot;. It is also the tune Sarah Jane Smith whistles when she leaves the Doctor at the end of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Hand of Fear&quot;. It is sung by the &quot;EastEnders&quot; cast, led by Anna Wing (Lou Beale, as part of the &quot;1985 EastEnders Sing Along&quot;. In the first episode of the 1983 BBC series &quot;Reilly, Ace of Spies&quot;, one of Sidney Reilly&#x27;s mistresses performs a striptease to a phonograph recording of the song.

==On CD==
*A version of Vesta Victoria singing the song can be found on the CD &quot;60 Old-Time Variety Songs&quot; 
*It also appears on the &quot;Ultimate Pub Sing-A-Long Album&quot;

==Lyrics==
I love my little cat, I do&lt;br&gt;
With soft black silky hair&lt;br&gt;
It comes with me each day to school&lt;br&gt;
And sits upon the chair&lt;br&gt;
When teacher says &quot;why do you bring&lt;br&gt;
That little pet of yours?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
I tell her that I bring my cat&lt;br&gt;
Along with me because

Daddy wouldn&#x27;t buy me a bow-wow! bow wow!&lt;br&gt;
Daddy wouldn&#x27;t buy me a bow-wow! bow wow!&lt;br&gt;
I&#x27;ve got a little cat&lt;br&gt;
And I&#x27;m very fond of that&lt;br&gt;
But I&#x27;d rather have a bow-wow&lt;br&gt;
Wow, wow, wow, wow

We used to have two tiny dogs&lt;br&gt;
Such pretty little dears&lt;br&gt;
But daddy sold &#x27;em &#x27;cause they used&lt;br&gt;
To bite each other&#x27;s ears&lt;br&gt;
I cried all day, at eight each night&lt;br&gt;
Papa sent me to bed&lt;br&gt;
When Ma came home and wiped my eyes&lt;br&gt;
I cried again and said

Daddy wouldn&#x27;t buy me a bow-wow! bow wow!&lt;br&gt;
Daddy wouldn&#x27;t buy me a bow-wow! bow wow!&lt;br&gt;
I&#x27;ve got a little cat&lt;br&gt;
And I&#x27;m very fond of that&lt;br&gt;
But I&#x27;d rather have a bow-wow&lt;br&gt;
Wow, wow, wow, wow

I&#x27;ll be so glad when I get old&lt;br&gt;
To do just as I &quot;likes&quot;&lt;br&gt;
I&#x27;ll keep a parrot and at least&lt;br&gt;
A half a dozen tykes&lt;br&gt;
And when I&#x27;ve got a tiny pet&lt;br&gt;
I&#x27;ll kiss the little thing&lt;br&gt;
Then put it in its little cot&lt;br&gt;
And on to it I&#x27;ll sing

Daddy wouldn&#x27;t buy me a bow-wow! bow wow!&lt;br&gt;
Daddy wouldn&#x27;t buy me a bow-wow! bow wow!&lt;br&gt;
I&#x27;ve got a little cat&lt;br&gt;
And I&#x27;m very fond of that&lt;br&gt;
But I&#x27;d rather have a bow-wow&lt;br&gt;
Wow, wow, wow, wow

<text>Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) is an American video game company headquartered in Redwood City, California. Founded in May 1982 by former Apple employee Trip Hawkins, the company was a pioneer of the early home computer game industry and promoted the designers and programmers responsible for its games as &quot;software artists&quot;. EA published numerous games and some productivity software for personal computers, all of which were developed by external individuals or groups until 1987&#x27;s &quot;Skate or Die!&quot; The company shifted toward internal game studios, often through acquisitions, such as Distinctive Software becoming EA Canada in 1991.

Into the 21st century, EA develops and publishes games of established franchises, including &quot;Battlefield&quot;, &quot;Need for Speed&quot;, &quot;The Sims&quot;, &quot;Medal of Honor&quot;, &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot;, &quot;Dead Space&quot;, &quot;Mass Effect&quot;, &quot;Dragon Age&quot;, &quot;Army of Two&quot;, &quot;Apex Legends&quot;, and &quot;Star Wars&quot;, as well as the EA Sports titles &quot;FC&quot;, &quot;FIFA&quot;, &quot;Madden NFL&quot;, &quot;NBA Live&quot;, &quot;NHL&quot;, &quot;PGA&quot;, and &quot;UFC&quot;. Since 2022, their desktop titles appear on self-developed EA App, an online gaming digital distribution platform for PCs and a direct competitor to Valve&#x27;s Steam and Epic Games&#x27; Store. EA also owns and operates major gaming studios such as DICE, Motive Studio, BioWare, and Respawn Entertainment.

==History==
===1982–1991: Trip Hawkins era, founding, and early success===

Trip Hawkins had been an Apple Inc. employee since 1978, at a time when the firm had only about fifty employees. Over the next four years, the market for home personal computers skyrocketed. By 1982, Apple had completed its initial public offering (IPO) and become a Fortune 500 company with over one thousand employees. In February 1982, Hawkins arranged a meeting with Don Valentine of Sequoia Capital to discuss financing his new venture, Amazin&#x27; Software. Valentine encouraged Hawkins to leave Apple, where the latter served as Director of Product Marketing, and allowed Hawkins to use Sequoia Capital&#x27;s spare office space to start the company. Trip Hawkins incorporated and established the company with a personal investment of an estimated on May 27, 1982.

For more than seven months, Hawkins refined his Electronic Arts business plan. With aid from his first employee (with whom he worked in marketing at Apple), Rich Melmon, the original plan was written, mostly by Hawkins, on an Apple II in Sequoia Capital&#x27;s office in August 1982. During that time, Hawkins also employed two of his former staff from Apple, Dave Evans and Pat Marriott, as producers, and a Stanford MBA classmate, Jeff Burton from Atari for international business development. The business plan was again refined in September and reissued on October 8, 1982. By November, the employee headcount rose to 11, including Tim Mott, Bing Gordon, David Maynard, and Steve Hayes. Having outgrown the office space provided by Sequoia Capital, the company relocated to a San Mateo office that overlooked the San Francisco Airport landing path.

When he incorporated the company, Hawkins originally chose Amazin&#x27; Software as their company name, but his other early employees of the company universally disliked the name; as a result, the company changed its name to Electronic Arts in November 1982. He scheduled an off-site meeting in the Pajaro Dunes, where the company once held such off-site meetings. Hawkins had developed the ideas of treating software as an art form and calling the developers &quot;software artists&quot;. Hence, the latest version of the business plan suggested the name &quot;SoftArt&quot;. Hawkins and Melmon knew the founders of Software Arts, the creators of VisiCalc, and thought their permission should be obtained. Dan Bricklin did not want the name used because it sounded too similar (perhaps &quot;confusingly similar&quot;) to &quot;Software Arts&quot;; however, the name concept was liked by all the attendees. Hawkins had also recently read a bestselling book about the film studio United Artists and liked the reputation that the company had created. Hawkins said everyone had a vote, but they would lose it if they went to sleep.
Hawkins liked the word &quot;electronic&quot;, and various employees had considered the phrases &quot;Electronic Artists&quot; and &quot;Electronic Arts&quot;. When Gordon and others pushed for &quot;Electronic Artists&quot;, in tribute to the film company United Artists, Steve Hayes opposed, saying, &quot;We&#x27;re not the artists, they [the developers] are...&quot; This statement from Hayes immediately tilted sentiment towards Electronic Arts and the name was unanimously endorsed and adopted later in 1982. He recruited his original employees from Apple, Atari, Xerox PARC, and VisiCorp, and got Steve Wozniak to agree to sit on the board of directors. Hawkins was determined to sell directly to buyers. Combined with the fact that Hawkins was pioneering new game brands, this made sales growth more challenging. Retailers wanted to buy known brands from existing distribution partners. Former CEO Larry Probst arrived as VP of Sales in late 1984 and helped expand the already successful company. This policy of dealing directly with retailers gave EA higher margins and better market awareness, key advantages the company leveraged to leapfrog its early competitors.

Promoting its developers was a trademark of EA&#x27;s early days. Games were sold in square packages modeled after album covers (such as those for 1983&#x27;s &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot; and &quot;Pinball Construction Set&quot;). Hawkins thought the packaging would both save costs and convey an artistic feeling. EA routinely referred to their developers as &quot;artists&quot; and gave them photo credits in their games and full-page magazine ads. Their first such ad, accompanied by the slogan &quot;We see farther,&quot; was the first video game advertisement to feature software designers. EA shared lavish profits with their developers, which added to their industry appeal.
In the mid-1980s, Electronic Arts aggressively marketed products for the Amiga, a home computer introduced in 1985. Commodore had given EA development tools and prototype machines before Amiga&#x27;s actual launch. For Amiga EA published some notable non-game titles. A drawing program &quot;Deluxe Paint&quot; (1985) and its subsequent versions became perhaps the most famous piece of software available for Amiga platform. In addition, EA&#x27;s Jerry Morrison conceived the idea of a file format that could store images, animations, sounds, and documents simultaneously, and would be compatible with third-party software. He wrote and released to the public the Interchange File Format, which soon became an Amiga standard. Other Amiga programs released by EA included &quot;Deluxe Music Construction Set&quot;, &quot;Instant Music&quot; and &quot;Deluxe Paint Animation&quot;. Some of them, most notably &quot;Deluxe Paint&quot;, were ported to other platforms. For Macintosh EA released a black &amp; white animation tool called Studio/1, and a series of Paint titles called Studio/8 and Studio/32 (1990).

Relationships between Electronic Arts and their external developers often became difficult when the latter missed deadlines or diverged from the former&#x27;s creative directions. In 1987, EA released &quot;Skate or Die!&quot;, their first internally developed game. EA continued publishing their external developers&#x27; games while experimenting with their internal development strategy. This led to EA&#x27;s decision of purchasing out a series of companies they identify as successful, as well as the decision to release annualized franchises to cut budget costs. Because of Trip Hawkins&#x27; obsession of simulating a sports game, he signed a contract with football coach John Madden that led to EA&#x27;s developing and releasing annual &quot;Madden NFL&quot; games.

In 1988, EA published a flight simulator game exclusively for Amiga, &quot;F/A-18 Interceptor&quot;, with filled-polygon graphics that were advanced for the time. Another significant Amiga release (also initially available for Atari ST, later converted for other platforms) was &quot;Populous&quot; (1989) developed by Bullfrog Productions. It was a pioneering title in the genre that was later called &quot;god games&quot;. In 1990, Electronic Arts began producing console games for the Nintendo Entertainment System, after previously licensing its computer games to other console-game publishers.

On March 26, 1990, Electronic Arts filed for an IPO at the NASDAQ stock exchange and went public under the ticker symbol &quot;ERTS&quot;, opening at a split-adjusted price of $0.52. The symbol was changed to &quot;EA&quot; on December 20, 2011.

===1991–2007: Larry Probst era, continuous expansion, and success into the new millennium===
In 1991, Trip Hawkins stepped down as EA&#x27;s CEO and was succeeded by Larry Probst. Hawkins went on to found the now-defunct 3DO Company, but still remained EA&#x27;s chair until July 1994. In October 1993, 3DO developed the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, which at the time was the most powerful game console. Once a critic of game consoles, Hawkins had conceived a console that unlike its competitors would not require a first-party license to be marketed, and was intended to appeal to the PC market. Electronic Arts was The 3DO Company&#x27;s primary partner in sponsoring their console, showcasing on it their latest games. With a retail price of US$700 () compared to its competitors&#x27; $100, the console lagged in sales, and with the 1995 arrival to North America of Sony&#x27;s PlayStation, a cheaper and more powerful alternative, combined with a lower quality of the 3DO&#x27;s software library as a backfiring of its liberal license policy, it fell further behind and lost competition. Electronic Arts dropped its support for 3DO in favor of the PlayStation, 3DO&#x27;s production ceased in 1996 and, for the remainder of the company&#x27;s lifetime, 3DO developed video games for other consoles and the IBM PC until it folded in 2003.
In 1994, Electronic Arts and THQ signed a licensing agreement to develop and release EA&#x27;s titles, like &quot;John Madden Football&quot;, &quot;FIFA International Soccer&quot;, &quot;Shaq Fu&quot;, &quot;Jungle Strike&quot; and Urban Strike for various consoles. In 1995, Electronic Arts won the European Computer Trade Show award for best software publisher of the year. As the company was still expanding, they opted to purchase space in Redwood Shores, California in 1995 for construction of a new headquarters, which was completed in 1998. Early in 1997, &quot;Next Generation&quot; identified Electronic Arts as the only company to regularly profit from video games over the past five years, and noted it had &quot;a critical track record second to none&quot;. In 1999, EA replaced their long-running Shapes logo with one based on the EA Sports logo used at the time. EA also started to use a brand-specific structure around this time, such as names like Westwood Studios, Maxis, Jane&#x27;s Combat Simulations and Bullfrog Productions, as well as the short-lived label Gonzo Games with the main publishing side of the company (also known as Action and Entertainment) rebranding to EA Games in 2000. The EA Sports brand was retained for major sports titles, the new EA Sports Big label would be used for casual sports titles with an arcade twist, and the full Electronic Arts name would be used for co-published and distributed titles. EA began to move toward direct distribution of digital games and services with the acquisition of the popular online gaming site Pogo.com in 2001. In 2009, EA acquired the London-based social gaming startup Playfish.

In December 1997, Electronic Arts ended their Japanese publishing joint-venture with Victor Entertainment, entitled Electronic Arts Victor, and purchased out Victor&#x27;s 35% stake in the venture. On May 1, 1998, Electronic Arts announced the formation of two joint-ventures with Square. The first; Electronic Arts Square K.K., would publish Electronic Arts&#x27; titles in Japan and also developed the PlayStation 2 launch title &quot;X-Squad&quot;. The second; Square Electronic Arts L.L.C., would publish Square&#x27;s titles in North America. The venture was described as a success by Square, as it allowed the company to release more of their titles in the North American market. In February 2003, with the preparation of Square and Enix&#x27;s merger into Square Enix; both partnerships were announced to be dissolved at the end of March with each partner buying the other&#x27;s shares. Electronic Arts Square was renamed as Electronic Arts K.K. and began self-publishing EA&#x27;s titles in Japan from then on while Square Electronic Arts was folded under Square Enix&#x27;s North American operations.

In 2004, EA made a multimillion-dollar donation to fund the development of game production curriculum at the University of Southern California&#x27;s Interactive Media Division. On February 1, 2006, Electronic Arts announced that it would cut worldwide staff by 5 percent. On June 20, 2006, EA purchased Mythic Entertainment, who are finished making &quot;Warhammer Online&quot;. After Sega&#x27;s &quot;ESPN NFL 2K5&quot; successfully grabbed market share away from EA&#x27;s dominant Madden NFL series during the 2004 holiday season, EA responded by making several large sports licensing deals which include an exclusive agreement with the NFL, and in January 2005, a 15-year deal with ESPN. The ESPN deal gave EA exclusive first rights to all ESPN content for sports simulation games. On April 11, 2005, EA announced a similar, 6-year licensing deal with the Collegiate Licensing Company (CLC) for exclusive rights to college football content.

Much of EA&#x27;s success, both in terms of sales and with regards to its stock market valuation, is due to its strategy of platform-agnostic development and the creation of strong multi-year franchises. EA was the first publisher to release yearly updates of its sports franchises—&quot;Madden&quot;, &quot;FIFA&quot;, &quot;NHL&quot;, &quot;NBA Live&quot;, &quot;Tiger Woods&quot;, etc.—with updated player rosters and small graphical and gameplay tweaks. Recognizing the risk of franchise fatigue among consumers, EA announced in 2006 that it would concentrate more of its effort on creating new original intellectual property. In September 2006, Nokia and EA announced a partnership in which EA becomes an exclusive major supplier of mobile games to Nokia mobile devices through the Nokia Content Discoverer. In the beginning, Nokia customers were able to download seven EA titles (&quot;Tetris&quot;, &quot;Tetris Mania&quot;, &quot;The Sims 2&quot;, &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;FIFA 06&quot;, &quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06&quot; and &quot;FIFA Street 2&quot;) on the holiday season in 2006. Rick Simonson is the executive vice-president and director of Nokia and starting from 2006 is affiliated with John Riccitiello and are partners.

===2007–2013: John Riccitiello era===

In February 2007, Probst stepped down from the CEO job while remaining on the board of directors. His handpicked successor is John Riccitiello, who had worked at EA for several years previously, departed for a while, and then returned. Riccitiello previously worked for Elevation Partners, Sara Lee and PepsiCo. In June 2007, new CEO John Riccitiello announced that EA would reorganize itself into four labels, each with responsibility for its own product development and publishing (the city-state model). The goal of the reorganization was to empower the labels to operate more autonomously, streamline decision-making, increase creativity and quality, and get games into the market faster. This reorganization came after years of consolidation and acquisition by EA of smaller studios, which some in the industry blamed for a decrease in quality of EA titles. In 2008, at the DICE Summit, Riccitiello called the earlier approach of &quot;buy and assimilate&quot; a mistake, often stripping smaller studios of its creative talent. Riccitiello said that the city-state model allows independent developers to remain autonomous to a large extent, and cited Maxis and BioWare as examples of studios thriving under the new structure.

During 2007, EA announced that it would be bringing some of its major titles to the Mac. EA also released &quot;Battlefield 2142&quot;, &quot;Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars&quot;, &quot;Crysis&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;, &quot;Madden NFL 08&quot;, &quot;Need for Speed: Carbon&quot;, and &quot;Spore&quot; for the Mac. All of the new games have been developed for the Macintosh using Cider, a technology developed by TransGaming that enables Intel-based Macs to run Windows games inside a translation layer running on Mac OS X. They are not playable on PowerPC-based Macs.

In February 2008, it was revealed that Electronic Arts had made a takeover bid for rival game company Take-Two Interactive. After its initial offer of per share, all cash stock transaction offer was rejected by the Take-Two board, EA revised it to per share, a 64% premium over the previous day&#x27;s closing price and made the offer known to the public. Rumours had been floating around the Internet prior to the offer about Take-Two possibly being bought over by a bigger company, albeit with Viacom as the potential bidder. In May 2008, EA announced that it would purchase the assets of Hands-On Mobile Korea, a South Korean mobile game developer and publisher. The company became EA Mobile Korea. In September 2008, EA dropped its buyout offer of Take-Two. No reason was given.

As of November 6, 2008, it was confirmed that Electronic Arts is closing their Casual Label &amp; merging it with their Hasbro partnership with The Sims Label. EA also confirmed the departure of Kathy Vrabeck, who was given the position as former president of the EA Casual Division in May 2007. EA made this statement about the merger: &quot;We&#x27;ve learned a lot about casual entertainment in the past two years, and found that casual gaming defies a single genre and demographic. With the retirement and departure of Kathy Vrabeck, EA is reorganizing to integrate casual games—development and marketing—into other divisions of our business. We are merging our Casual Studios, Hasbro partnership, and Casual marketing organization with The Sims Label to be a new Sims and Casual Label, where there is a deep compatibility in the product design, marketing and demographics. ... In the days and weeks ahead, we will make further announcements on the reporting structure for the other businesses in the Casual Label including EA Mobile, Pogo, Media Sales and Online Casual Initiatives. Those businesses remain growth priorities for EA and deserve strong support in a group that will complement their objectives.&quot; This statement comes a week after EA announced it was laying off 6% about 600 of their staff positions and had a net loss for the quarter.

Due to the 2008 economic crisis, Electronic Arts had a poorer than expected 2008 holiday season, moving it in February 2009 to cut approximately 1,100 jobs, which it said represented about 11% of its workforce. It also closed 12 of their facilities. Riccitiello, in a conference call with reporters, stated that their poor performance in the fourth quarter was not due entirely to the poor economy, but also to the fact that they did not release any blockbuster titles in the quarter. In the quarter ending December 31, 2008, the company lost . On February 2, 2009, Ludlum Entertainment had signed a deal with Electronic Arts to grant exclusive rights to bring the work of Robert Ludlum into video gaming. As of early May 2009, the subsidiary studio EA Redwood Shores was known as Visceral Games. On June 24, 2009, EA announced it would merge two of its development studios, BioWare and Mythic into one single role-playing video game and MMO development powerhouse. The move placed Mythic under control of BioWare as Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk went in direct control of the new entity. By fall 2012, both Muzyka and Zeschuk had chosen to depart the merged entity in a joint retirement announcement.

On November 9, 2009, EA announced layoffs of 1,500 employees, representing 17% of its workforce, across a number of studios including EA Tiburon, Visceral Games, Mythic and EA Black Box. Also affected were &quot;projects and support activities&quot; that, according to Chief Financial Officer Eric Brown &quot;don&#x27;t make economic sense&quot;, resulting in the shutdown of popular communities such as Battlefield News and the EA Community Team. These layoffs also led to the complete shutdown of Pandemic Studios.

In October 2010, EA announced the acquisition of England-based iPhone and iPad games publisher Chillingo for in cash. Chillingo published the popular &quot;Angry Birds&quot; for iOS and &quot;Cut the Rope&quot; for all platforms, but the deal did not include those properties, so &quot;Cut the Rope&quot; became published by ZeptoLab, and &quot;Angry Birds&quot; became published by Rovio Entertainment. On May 4, 2011, EA reported $3.8 billion in revenues for the fiscal year ending March 2011, and on January 13, 2012, EA announced that it had exceeded $1 billion in digital revenue during the previous calendar year. In a note to employees, EA CEO John Riccitiello called this &quot;an incredibly important milestone&quot; for the company.

In June 2011, EA launched Origin, an online service to sell downloadable games for personal computers directly to consumers. Around this time, Valve, which runs Steam in direct competition with Origin, announced changes to storefront policy disallowing games that used in-game purchases that were not tied to Steam&#x27;s purchasing process, and removed several of EA&#x27;s games, including &quot;Crysis 2&quot;, &quot;Dragon Age II&quot;, and &quot;&quot; in 2012. Although it released a new packaged version of &quot;Crysis 2&quot; that included all the downloadable content without the storefront features, EA did not publish any additional games on Steam until 2019, instead selling all personal computer versions of games through Origin.

In July 2011, EA announced that it had acquired PopCap Games, the company behind games such as &quot;Plants vs. Zombies&quot;, &quot;Peggle&quot; and &quot;Bejeweled&quot;. EA continued its shift toward digital goods in 2012, folding its mobile-focused EA Interactive (EAi) division &quot;into other organizations throughout the company, specifically those divisions led by EA Labels president Frank Gibeau, COO Peter Moore, and CTO Rajat Taneja, and EVP of digital Kristian Segerstrale.&quot;

===2013–2022: Andrew Wilson era, Disney partnership, and monetization===
On March 18, 2013, John Riccitiello announced that he would be stepping down as CEO and a member of the Board of Directors on March 30, 2013. Larry Probst was also appointed executive chairman on the same day. Andrew Wilson was named as the new CEO of EA by September 2013. In April 2013, EA announced a reorganization which was to include dismissal of 10% of their workforce, consolidation of marketing functions which were distributed among the five label organizations, and subsumption of Origin operational leadership under the President of Labels. EA acquired the lucrative exclusive license to develop games within the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe from Disney in May 2013, shortly after Disney&#x27;s closure of its internal LucasArts game development in 2013. EA secured its license from 2013 through 2023, and began to assign new &quot;Star Wars&quot; projects across several of its internal studios, including BioWare, DICE, Visceral Games, Motive Studios, Capital Games and external developer Respawn Entertainment.

In April 2015, EA announced that it would be shutting down various free-to-play games in July of that year, including &quot;Battlefield Heroes&quot;, &quot;Battlefield Play4Free&quot;, &quot;Need for Speed: World&quot;, and &quot;FIFA World&quot;. The reorganization and revised marketing strategy lead to a gradual increase in stock value. In July 2015, Electronic Arts reached an all-time high with a stock value of US$71.63, surpassing the previous February 2005 record of $68.12. This is also up 54% from $46.57 in early January 2015. The surge was partly attributed to EA&#x27;s then-highly anticipated &quot;Star Wars Battlefront&quot; reboot, which released one month before &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;, also highly anticipated.

During E3 2015, EA vice-president Patrick Söderlund announced that the company would start investing more on smaller titles such as &quot;Unravel&quot; so as to broaden the company&#x27;s portfolio. On December 10, 2015, EA announced a new division called Competitive Gaming Division, which focuses on creating competitive game experience and organizing ESports events. It was once headed by Peter Moore. In May 2016, Electronic Arts announced that they had formed a new internal division called Frostbite Labs. The new department specializes in creating new projects for virtual reality platforms, and &quot;virtual humans&quot;. The new department is located in Stockholm and Vancouver. EA announced the closure of Visceral Games in October 2017. Prior, Visceral had been supporting EA&#x27;s other games but was also working on a &quot;Star Wars&quot; title named &quot;Project Ragtag&quot; since EA&#x27;s acquisition of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; license, even hiring Amy Hennig to direct the project. While EA did not formally give a reason for the closure, industry pundits believed that EA was concerned about the principally single-player game which would be difficult to monetize, as well as the slow pace of development.

EA&#x27;s original approach to the microtransactions in &quot;Star Wars Battlefront II&quot; sparked an industry-wide debate on the use of random-content loot boxes. While other games had used loot boxes, EA&#x27;s original approach within &quot;Battlefront II&quot; from its early October 2017 launch included using such mechanics for pay to win gameplay elements, as well as locking various &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters behind expensive paywalls, leading several gaming journalists and players to complain. EA modified some of the costs of these elements in anticipation of the game&#x27;s full November 2017 launch, but they were reportedly told by Disney to disable all microtransactions until they could come up with a fairer monetization scheme. By March 2018, EA had developed a fairer system that eliminated the pay to win elements and drastically reduced costs for unlocking characters. The controversy over &quot;Battlefront II&quot; loot boxes led to an 8.5% drop in stock value in one month—about $3.1 billion and impacted EA&#x27;s financial results for the following quarters. Furthermore, the visibility of this controversy led to debate at government levels around the world to determine if loot boxes were a form of gambling and if they should be regulated.

In January 2018, EA announced eMLS, a new competitive league for EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA 18&quot; through its Competitive Gaming Division (CGD) and MLS. That same month, EA teamed up with ESPN and Disney XD in a multi-year pact to broadcast &quot;Madden NFL&quot; competitive matches across the world through its Competitive Gaming Division arm. On August 14, 2018, Patrick Söderlund announced his departure from EA as its vice-president and chief design officer, after serving twelve years with the company. With Söderlund&#x27;s departure, the SEED group was moved as part of EA&#x27;s studios, while the EA Originals and EA Partners teams were moved under the company&#x27;s Strategic Growth group.

On February 6, 2019, Electronic Arts&#x27; stock value was hit by a decline of 13.3%, the worst decline since Halloween 2008. This was largely due to the marketing of their anticipated title &quot;Battlefield V&quot;, which was released after the holiday season of October 2018. Stocks were already declining since late August, when EA announced that &quot;Battlefield V&quot;″s release would be delayed until November. Upon release, the game was met with a mixed reception, and EA sold one million fewer copies than their expected figure of 7.3 million. Also attributed to the stock plunge was the game&#x27;s lack of the game mode Battle Royale, popularized by &quot;PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds&quot; and then &quot;Fortnite&quot;. Stocks then surged 9.6% with the surprise release of &quot;Apex Legends&quot;, which garnered 25 million players in just one week, significantly surpassing &quot;Fortnite&quot;″s record of 10 million players in two weeks. In advance of the end of its financial quarter ending March 31, 2019, Wilson announced they were cutting about 350 jobs, or about 4% of its workforce, primarily from their marketing, publishing, and operations divisions. Wilson stated the layoffs were necessary to &quot;address our challenges and prepare for the opportunities ahead&quot;.

EA announced in October 2019 that it would be returning to release games on Steam, starting with the November 2019 release of &quot;Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order&quot;, as well as bringing the EA Access subscription service to Steam. While EA plans to continue to sell games on Origin, the move to add Steam releases was to help get more consumers to see their offerings. Due to COVID-19 lockdowns and growing demand for online games, EA&#x27;s revenue grew to $1.4bn in the first quarter of 2020. EA rebranded both EA Access and Origin to EA Play on August 18, 2020, but otherwise without changing the subscription price or services offered as part of a streamlining effort. In December 2020, EA placed a bid to buy Codemasters, a British developer of racing games, in a deal worth $1.2 billion, outbidding an earlier offer placed by Take-Two Interactive. The acquisition, agreed to by Codemasters, was completed by February 18, 2021, with all shares of Codemasters transferred to Codex Games Limited, a subsidiary of EA. Wilson stated that &quot;the franchises in our combined portfolio will enable us to create innovative new experiences and bring more players into the excitement of cars and motorsport&quot;.

In January 2021, Disney announced it had revived the Lucasfilm Games label for its licensed video game properties and announced new games including a new &quot;Star Wars&quot; game that would be developed by Ubisoft aimed for release in 2023, indicating that EA&#x27;s ten-year exclusive license in 2013 to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; property was likely not extended. EA still maintained a non-exclusive license to &quot;Star Wars&quot; games, affirming more titles would be coming following this announcement. As of February 2021, EA&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; games had sold more than 52 million copies and brought in more than in revenue. After a six-year absence from producing college sports-based game due to legal issues related to student athlete likenesses with the NCAA, EA announced in February 2021 that it was returning to college sports with a planned &quot;EA Sports College Football&quot; title to likely be released in 2023. The company announced its plans to extend its mobile commitment in February 2021 by acquiring Glu Mobile in an deal estimated worth . The acquisition was completed by the end of April 2021.

The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia acquired 7.4 million shares of EA, valued at , in February 2021. Former CEO and current chairman Probst stated in May 2021 he was retiring from the company. Current EA CEO Wilson took over as chairman. In June 2021, EA confirmed that they had suffered a data breach, with game and engine source code taken from their servers, including the source for the Frostbite Engine and &quot;FIFA 21&quot;; EA assured no player or user data had been obtained. Hackers that had taken the code had started selling it around on the dark web. The perpetuators of this breach began to extort EA for money in July, releasing small portions of the data to public forums and threatening to release more if their demands were not met.

EA acquired mobile game developer Playdemic Studios in Manchester, England from Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment in June 2021 for , following the merger of Discovery, Inc. with WarnerMedia. As of June 2021, the acquisition was expected to complete by 2022. In their SEC filings in September 2021, the company said that current CFO and COO Blake Jorgensen would be stepping down by mid-2022. The company&#x27;s COO role was taken over by Chief Studios Officer Laura Miele, while a search for a new CFO was launched. Longtime Microsoft executive Chris Suh was later appointed as CFO in March 2022. Industry reports around May 2022 asserted that EA had been looking to be acquired by larger media firms, including Disney, Apple, and Comcast/NBCUniversal. These reports said that EA had been nearing a final deal that would have had NBCUniversal spun out from Comcast before bringing EA within it. Amazon was also mentioned as a possible customer for EA; CNBC reported in late August that Amazon was no longer interested in a takeover.

===2023–present: Internal restructuring and layoffs===
In January 2023, EA cancelled development on Apex Legends Mobile and Battlefield Mobile, leading to the shutdown of developer Industrial Toys. On February 28, 2023, EA eliminated 200 QA testers from its Baton Rouge, Louisiana office. The testers predominantly worked on Respawn Entertainment&#x27;s Apex Legends battle royale game. On March 29, EA announced it would lay off 6% of its workforce, or 775 employees.

In June 2023, EA announced an internal reorganization of the company. CEO Andrew Wilson announced a realignment of the company into two organizations – EA Sports and EA Entertainment – both of which would report directly to him, having Laura Miele, previously Chief Studios Officer and COO, as the president of EA Entertainment, and Cam Weber, formerly EVP and group General Manager of EA Sports as president of EA Sports. Vince Zampella, Samantha Ryan, and Jeff Karp continued on EA Entertainment, leading and overseeing specific studios under EA Entertainment. Also announced in the same day, CFO Chris Suh and chief experience officer Chris Bruzzo would be leaving the company at the end of the month, with the first leaving for another company while the other going to retire. In place of Suh as CFO came Stuart Canfield, a 20-year veteran of the company who had most recently been serving as SVP of enterprise finance and investor relations, while the company&#x27;s new chief experiences officer became David Tinson, previously the company&#x27;s chief marketing officer.

On August 23, EA announced it was eliminating 50 roles at BioWare, or 20% of its workforce. A group of former employees later sued EA, seeking better severance following their layoffs.

In December 2023, EA laid off an unknown number of Codemasters employees. In February 2024, EA announced that it would lay off 670 employees, or 5% of its global workforce. The cuts came with the cancellation of a first-person shooter set in the Star Wars universe, and that the company would be moving away from licensed IP in favor of EA-owned franchises.

In July 2024, actor labor union Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), which also has numerous video game voice actors as members, would initiate a labor strike against a number of video publishers, including EA, over concerns about lack of A.I. protections not only for video game actors, but also the use of A.I to replicate an actor’s voice, or create a digital replica of their likeness.

In January 2025, EA lowered its upcoming annual revenue forecast due to the underperformance of both &quot;EA Sports FC 25&quot; (September 2024) and &quot;Dragon Age: The Veilguard&quot; (October 2024). &quot;Bloomberg&quot; reported that &quot;EA pinned most of the blame on its soccer title&quot;. Later that month, EA restructured and downsized BioWare; the studio &quot;is now down from more than 200 people two years ago to less than 100&quot;. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; highlighted that &quot;well-known BioWare veterans&quot; are no longer at the company and &quot;collectively, the cuts represent a major loss of creative talent for the studio, and bears echoes of BioWare&#x27;s layoff of roughly 50 employees in 2023&quot;.

== Games ==

Since 1983 and the 1987 release of its Skate or Die!, Electronic Arts has respectively published and developed games, bundles, as well as a handful of earlier productivity software.

== Company structure ==
As of April 2021, Electronic Arts&#x27; largest acquisition is the purchase of Glu Mobile, for $2.4 billion. Of the 39 companies acquired by EA, 20 are based in the U.S., five in the United Kingdom, six in Continental Europe, and eight elsewhere. The majority of these companies and studios are now , with some having been merged into other entities. Of the six companies which EA purchased a stake in, two remaining companies are based in the U.S., while three other U.S. companies are defunct. After acquiring a 19.9% stake in France-based Ubisoft in 2004, EA sold a remaining 14.8% stake in it in 2010.
Since June 2023, the company is organized in two main divisions: EA Entertainment Technology &amp; Central Development (EA Entertainment for short, formerly EA Games) and EA Sports.

==== Former labels ====
* EA Kids — A label for educational titles. In January 1995, EA sold the label to and in conjunction with Capital Cities/ABC formed the independent ABC/EA Home Software, which was later absorbed into Creative Wonders in that year&#x27;s May.

* Electronic Arts Studios
* EA Games- A label used for non-sports games between 2000 and 2005. In 2005 the label was dropped and non-sports games used a EA label instead.

==Partnership and initiatives==

===EA Partners program (1997–present)===
EA Partners&#x27; co-publishing program was dedicated to publishing and distributing games developed by third-party developers. EA Partners began as EA Distribution, formed in 1997 and led by Tom Frisina, a former executive from Accolade and Three-Sixty who helped both companies find third-party developers as to provide publishing support for them. Frisina&#x27;s early partners included Looking Glass Studios, MGM Interactive for the rights to the &quot;James Bond&quot; property, DreamWorks Interactive, and eventually DICE; in the latter two cases, these studios were acquired by EA as part of the EA DICE family. In 2003, EA&#x27;s president John Riccitiello pushed for a renaming of the EA Distribution label, seeing the potential to bring in more independent developers and additional revenue streams. While they rebranded the label as EA Partners in 2003, Riccitiello left EA the following year, which disrupted the direction the label had been aiming to go.

Oddworld Inhabitants, who had signed on with EA Partner for their next &quot;Oddworld&quot; games, found the situation difficult as EA Partners was reluctant to support games where they did not own the intellectual property rights and instead favored internal development. The situation with EA Partners switched gears in 2005 after EA and Valve signed an EA Partners deal for the physical distribution of &quot;The Orange Box&quot;; EA Partners realized it needed to be flexible to handle the different publishing opportunities presented to them. A similar breakthrough was reached with signing on Harmonix for the distribution of the &quot;Rock Band&quot; games, requiring them to work closely with MTV Games on the plastic instrument controllers necessary for the titles. A number of major partnerships were made over the next few years, including Namco Bandai, Crytek, Starbreeze Studios, id Software, Epic Games and People Can Fly, Double Fine Productions, Grasshopper Manufacture, Spicy Horse, and Realtime Worlds. While many of these partnerships proved successful, the division had two major marks on its name. It was associated with the situation around &quot;Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning&quot; developed by 38 Studios, which had been significantly backed by loans from taxpayer funds from the state of Rhode Island. &quot;Kingdoms&quot; failed to be commercially successful, and EA Partners pulled out of making a sequel, leaving 38 Studios in default of its loan payback to the state. Secondly, while &quot;The Secret World&quot; from Funcom launched as a subscription game, Funcom had to switch their monetization model to free-to-play to improve their revenues, which further affected EA Partners.

Around April 2013, as part of a large 1000-employee layoff, many reporters claimed that EA Partners was also being shut down for its poor commercial performance, but the program remained active as the company refocused its efforts. The label remained dormant over the next several years, while Letts expanded on the EA Originals program, but following the move of EA Partners and EA Origins into the Strategic Growth group in August 2018, the label was revived on the March 2019 with a publishing deal with Velan Studios, which ended up releasing under Originals as &quot;Knockout City&quot;.

Notable publishing/distribution agreements include:
* &quot;&quot; – Spicy Horse
* &quot;&quot; – Realtime Worlds
* &quot;Brütal Legend&quot; – Double Fine Productions
* &quot;Bulletstorm&quot; – Epic Games
* &quot;Crysis&quot; series – Crytek
* &quot;DeathSpank&quot; – Hothead Games
* &quot;Fuse&quot; – Insomniac Games
* &quot;&quot; – Flagship Studios
* &quot;Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning&quot; – 38 Studios, Big Huge Games
* &quot;Rock Band&quot; series – Harmonix and MTV Games
* &quot;The Secret World&quot; – Funcom
* &quot;Shadows of the Damned&quot; – Grasshopper Manufacture
* &quot;Shank&quot; series – Klei Entertainment
* &quot;Syndicate&quot; – Starbreeze Studios
* &quot;Warp&quot; – Trapdoor

=== EA Originals label (2017–present) ===

EA Originals is a label within Electronic Arts own EA Partners program to help support independently developed video games. EA funds the money for development, and once it recoups that, all additional revenue goes to the partner studio that created the game. That studio also gets to keep the intellectual property rights for whatever it creates, and even has creative control over the project. The program was announced at EA&#x27;s press event at the 2016 E3 Conference, and builds upon the success they had with &quot;Unravel&quot; from Coldwood Interactive in 2015. The first game to be supported under this program was &quot;Fe&quot; by Zoink, released in 2018. It was followed by &quot;A Way Out&quot; from Hazelight Studios, &quot;Unravel Two&quot; from Coldwood Interactive and &quot;Sea of Solitude&quot; from Jo-Mei Games.

In 2019, during its EA Play event, EA teased three new titles. Among the games featured were &quot;Lost in Random&quot; from Zoink and an unnamed title from Hazelight Studios. It was also announced that Glowmade would be entering the initiative with a title called &quot;RustHeart&quot;. In June 2020, Hazelight Studios&#x27; untitled project was revealed as &quot;It Takes Two&quot; and was released the following year to critical acclaim.

In February 2023, Jeff Gamon, general manager of EA Partners, which oversees the Originals label, said the label would invest on bigger games, although for those cases the deal would not be as generous as the smaller games, as those are larger companies. Gamon said that the company still plans to release smaller and niche games, and do not want to completely abandon its roots. One such title, &quot;Wild Hearts&quot; was developed by Koei Tecmo&#x27;s Omega Force; it was released in 2023 under the Originals label. &quot;Immortals of Aveum&quot; was released the same year.

In December 2023, EA announced &quot;Tales of Kenzera: Zau&quot; under the Originals label. In December 2024, EA announced &quot;Split Fiction&quot; under the Originals label as their third collaboration with Hazelight Studios.

==Criticism and controversies==

Since the mid-2010s, Electronic Arts has been in the center of numerous controversies involving acquisitions of companies and alleged anti-consumerist practices in their individual games, as well as lawsuits alleging EA&#x27;s anti-competition when signing sports-related contracts.

<doc id="262934" wikidata="Q3166" url="?curid=262934" title="Denny Hulme">
<text>Denis Clive Hulme (18 June 1936 – 4 October 1992) was a New Zealand racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Nicknamed &quot;the Bear&quot;, Hulme won the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in with Brabham, and won eight Grands Prix across 10 seasons. 

Born and raised in the South Island, Hulme was the son of Clive Hulme, who was a World War II sniper and Victoria Cross recipient. Hulme achieved eight race wins, one pole position, nine fastest laps and 33 podiums in Formula One. He also finished third in the overall standing in 1968 and 1972.

Hulme showed versatility by dominating the Canadian-American Challenge Cup (Can-Am) for Group 7 sports cars. As a member of the McLaren team that won five straight titles between 1967 and 1971, he won the individual Drivers&#x27; Championship twice and was runner-up on four other occasions.

Following his Formula One tenure with Brabham, Hulme raced for McLaren in multiple formats—Formula One, Can-Am, and at the Indianapolis 500. Hulme retired from Formula One at the end of the 1974 season but continued to race Australian Touring Cars.

Hulme was nicknamed &#x27;The Bear&#x27;, because of his &quot;gruff nature&quot; and &quot;rugged features&quot;; however, he was also &quot;sensitive (...) unable to express his feelings, except in a racing car&quot;. During the early part of his career, Hulme preferred to race bare foot as he believed that it gave him a better feel of the throttle. This changed in 1960 when he started competing in the more highly regulated European championships.

During his career, Hulme drove the most powerful cars of his era. He raced in F1, F2, Indycars, saloon/touring cars, CanAm and endurance races, all during the same season. After retiring from F1, he even drove in truck races.

Hulme&#x27;s death by heart attack, while driving a BMW M3 during the Bathurst 1000 in Australia, made him the seventh former Formula One champion to die, and the first to die of natural causes (versus three racing incidents, two incidents on public roads and one incident involving aircraft).

== Early racing career ==
Hulme was born on a tobacco farm belonging to his parents in Motueka in the South Island of New Zealand. His father Clive Hulme was awarded a Victoria Cross, as a sniper, while fighting in the Battle of Crete in 1941.

While growing up on his family&#x27;s farm in Pongakawa (near Te Puke), Hulme learned to drive a truck while sitting on his father&#x27;s lap; by the age of six, he was driving solo. He left school and went to work in a garage. He saved up enough money to buy an MG TF, promptly entering this in hillclimbing events. After that his father brought an MGA for him. After making impressive progress he purchased a F2 Cooper-Climax, subsequently being chosen for the New Zealand Driver to Europe program, along with fellow New Zealander, George Lawton. The pair of young New Zealanders began competing in Formula Junior and Formula Two across Europe, in a Cooper-BMC and Cooper–Ford respectively. Hulme won the 1960 Gran Premio di Pescara for Formula Juniors, but the newspapers back in New Zealand made no mention of this, as they wrote only about Bruce McLaren. However, the year, 1960 ended in disaster, when Lawton crashed during a race at Roskilde (Denmark) dying in Hulme&#x27;s arms.

As the New Zealand press were ignoring Hulme, he hired a 2½ litre Cooper from Reg Parnell and entered it in the 1961 New Zealand Gold Star Championship. He won the title straight away. He appeared at Le Mans for the Abarth team, taking a class win in S850 the class (partnered by fellow New Zealander Angus Hyslop), before Ken Tyrrell invited the likable (but sometimes gruff) New Zealander to race in his Formula Junior and Formula Two team, in 1962, when Tony Maggs was unavailable due to his Formula One commitments.

Once there, basing himself in London, he worked as a mechanic in Jack Brabham&#x27;s garage in Chessington and began to pave his way on his motor-racing path. It was Brabham who gave him drives in his Brabham sportscars and single seaters. During the 1963 season, he won seven International Formula Junior and after some impressive performances there, it was his old boss Jack Brabham who gave Hulme the call and he joined the Australian legend&#x27;s F2 team. In 1964, the pair set about dominating the Championship that year, resulting in a one–two finish in the FFSA Trophées de France series. The pair also finished one–two in the 1966 series. During this spell in F2 between 1964 and 1966, Hulme won three races in the series, plus two non-championship events (the 1964 Grote Prijs van Limborg and the 1965 Spring Trophy). Hulme was rewarded with some non-championship Formula One races.

Away from single seaters, Hulme also raced the occasional saloon car. In appalling conditions, on 6 July 1963, Hulme won his first major saloon car race. The second Motor-sponsored Six-Hour, a round of the European Touring Car Championship, saw the pre-race favourite, a 7-litre Ford Galaxie driven by Dan Gurney and Jack Brabham flounder in the wet and the Jaguars dominated the race. Hulme would win, partnered by Roy Salvadori, after the winners on the road were disqualified for engine irregularities.

== Formula One career==

===1965–1967: With Brabham===

After making numerous appearances in non-championship events for Brabham during the 1964 season, as the Brabham team had signed Dan Gurney to race alongside their boss, Hulme finally got the call he had been waiting for, making his World Championship debut in 1965 at Monaco. Later that year, he scored his first points, for fourth position at the daunting Clermont-Ferrand (Charade) circuit in France.

1966 was Hulme&#x27;s first full season of Formula One. Now, after the departure of Dan Gurney, he was the outright number two at the Brabham team behind Jack himself. Finishing a fine fourth that year (with Jack winning the Drivers&#x27; and the Brabham team the Constructors&#x27; Championship), the highlights came with a third place at Reims in France, a second behind Brabham at Brands Hatch, and the fastest lap at Zandvoort, before ignition problems put paid to his race there. Whilst his boss won the World title, Hulme made it to the podium four times during season, finishing fourth overall in the standings.

The 1967 Championship was essentially an internal affair within the Brabham Racing Organisation team for most of the year, but the new Lotus 49 gave Jim Clark and Graham Hill the opportunity to bite back. Their Brabham-Repcos were not the fastest cars, however they were reliable and consistent, as were Brabham and Hulme. During the season, he would take two wins in the 11-race Championship, at Monte Carlo and the ferocious Nürburgring (the Green Hell).

Although Hulme silenced many critics with his excellent win in Monaco, the race was marred by the appalling accident that would claim the life of Lorenzo Bandini, who was chasing Hulme at the time of the crash. His second Grand Prix win of 1967, was on the legendary &quot;Nordschleife&quot; of the Nürburgring. This victory proved his versatility on any type of track. A further six visits to the podium gave Hulme the advantage he needed. He won the Championship by five points from Brabham, and a further five from Jim Clark. Hulme was the first (and to date, only) Formula One World Champion from New Zealand.

===1968–1974: With McLaren===
 saw a move to the McLaren team, owned by fellow New Zealander Bruce McLaren. Although the &#x27;Bruce and Denny Show&#x27; dominated the North American Can-Am sports car series from 1966, their time in Formula One was less successful. The South African race, held at the legendary Kyalami circuit, proved difficult for the team. Despite having to use the old BRM V12 engines on an old M5A chassis, Hulme brought it home a creditable fifth.

By the Spanish round at Jarama, the Cosworth DFV V8 engine was installed in the brand new M7A chassis and the performances improved. After victory in the BRDC International Trophy, Hulme picked up second place in Spain, before taking two more wins that year at Monza and in Canada, leaving him with an outside chance of retaining the Championship crown against Graham Hill and the young Jackie Stewart.

The finale, in Mexico City, determined the champion that year, but Hulme suffered a suspension failure on his McLaren.

 was a disaster for Hulme: the revised M7A chassis struggled with reliability and Hulme managed only 20 points, attaining one victory, at the final round at the Mexican Grand Prix. Hulme ended the season in sixth position in the drivers&#x27; standings.

 brought a new decade, but Hulme&#x27;s luck did not change. Team boss and friend Bruce McLaren was killed while testing the CanAm McLaren M8D, which affected Hulme. Another problem occurred that year when he suffered burns to his hands from a methanol fire during practice for the Indianapolis 500. As a result, he missed the Dutch Grand Prix in 1970. Undeterred, he felt he owed it to Bruce and the McLaren team to continue racing. Besides his emotional distress and serious burns, he still managed a creditable fourth in the championship with 27 points.

Although Hulme would claim third place in the 1970 Mexican Grand Prix, the race was marred by the immense crowd of over 200,000. The crowd proved almost uncontrollable and almost forced the cancellation of the race. They were crammed in front of the guard-rails, sat at the trackside and ran across the track itself. The drivers were concerned that someone would be killed. During qualifying, Hulme missed some children by inches. They were playing a game of &quot;chicken&quot; to see who got nearest to the cars as they hurtled past.

 started promisingly. At Kyalami, he led dominantly but the rising-rate suspension system forced him out, after only a few laps. The McLaren team were in disarray. The season was even worse than 1970 results wise, as Hulme did not even make the podium, although he set the fastest laps in Canada and the United States that year but results were hard to come by. Hulme ended up ninth in the standings for 1971.

Beauty, fragrance and men&#x27;s products company Yardley took over title sponsorship of a new McLaren in , and it paid dividends for Hulme. Partnered with good friend Peter Revson, Hulme was back on winning ways taking victory in South Africa, and a few fine podiums elsewhere, finishing 1972 in third place with 39 points. Meanwhile, Hulme also won the non-championship International Gold Cup race at Oulton Park.

Amazingly, Hulme scored only one pole position in his F1 career aboard a McLaren M23, in 1973 at Kyalami—he appeared to have a good relationship with the South African venue. However, Hulme was outshone by friend and teammate Peter Revson in , and he finished a place down on the American in sixth, 12 points adrift.

By the 1973 Belgian Grand Prix, Hulme and McLaren had taken F1 safety forward, when his car introduced the Graviner life-support system to Formula One, supplying the driver breathable air in the event of fire.

Hulme won the Swedish Grand Prix luckily, though he also set the fastest lap. The race seemed to be set up for a home victory for Ronnie Peterson, with his Lotus teammate, Emerson Fittipaldi in second, when the Lotuses hit trouble. Fittipaldi being slowed with gearbox issues, and then Peterson with a slow rear wheel puncture. As Hulme decided to run with harder tyres, he passed Peterson on the penultimate lap to win. Hulme expressed sadness to &quot;have taken that away from Ronnie&quot;.

He and Revson had built up a strong friendship off the back of their F1 camaraderie they also competed together in the Can-Am series. When Revson left McLaren at the end of 1973 to join Shadow, Hulme would have been disappointed.

In his time at McLaren, Hulme won six Grand Prix&#x27;s, but he was nearing the end of his time in F1, and his competitive urges were being blunted by a growing apprehension about the dangers of racing. After the Brazilian Grand Prix in which Hulme finished twelfth, these fears were well founded. When testing at Kyalami started, in March 1974, Peter Revson suffered a front suspension failure (broken front Ball Joint), veering head-on into the barriers. Hulme tried in vain to save his friend&#x27;s life, but to no avail. After the accident Hulme announced that he would see out before retiring from Grand Prix racing. However, other than winning the Argentine event (he inherited the lead when his now teammate Fittipaldi inadvertently knocked-off the electrical &quot;kill-switch&quot; on his steering wheel, on the penultimate lap) and coming second in Austria, he did not make much of an impact on the season, and retired at the end of the year and stepped away from the sport and returned to New Zealand.

==Away from F1==
=== 1966 Le Mans 24 hours ===
At the finish of the 1966 Le Mans 24 hours, the two Shelby-American Inc. entered Ford GT40 MK II&#x27;s were both on the lead lap, running first and second, with the car Hulme was partnering with Ken Miles in the lead. In the lead half-hour of the race, the Fords bunched up together in a pre-arranged plan for Bruce McLaren and Miles to cross the line, headlights ablaze, in a dead-heat. Unfortunately the dead-heat that Henry Ford II had so proudly planned did not come off, as the timekeepers decided that a dead-heat was technically impossible as the Hulme/Miles car had qualified faster than the McLaren/Amon car, and therefore covered a shorter race distance. Therefore, when the two cars arrived side by side at the finish, Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon were classified as the winners, with Hulme and Ken Miles in second.

=== Can-Am (1966–1972) ===
In 1966, while driving for the Brabham team in Formula One, Hulme drove in the inaugural season of the Can-Am racing series of FIA Group 7 racing, driving the same Sid Taylor entered Lola T70 he had driven with success in UK Group 7 races that year, but achieving no success in the Can-Am races. In 1967 he joined the McLaren team of New Zealand countryman Bruce McLaren for the series, replacing Chris Amon who had gone to Ferrari. This partnership became so successful, the Americans called them the &#x27;Bruce and Denny Show&#x27;, such was their domination.
In the 1967 season, the year of his F1 Championship win with Brabham, Hulme finished second to team leader Bruce McLaren for the Can-Am championship, scoring three wins in six races and earning 24 points in the McLaren M6A. Hulme won the Can-Am Championship in 1968, taking three victories in the six race season, earning 35 points in the McLaren M8A. 1969 saw the McLaren team continue to dominate the series; driving the McLaren M8B, they won every race, with multiple 1–2 finishes, and even a 1–2–3 finish when Dan Gurney drove the spare car. Hulme scored five victories in eleven races in 1969, earning 160 points to finish second to teammate McLaren in the championship.

The 1970 season was difficult for the team, as they mourned the loss of leader Bruce McLaren, who had died while pre-season testing the McLaren M8D &quot;Batmobile&quot; at the Goodwood Circuit. Teamed first with driver Dan Gurney, then with driver Peter Gethin, Hulme led the team with six wins in ten races, winning his second Can-Am Championship driving the M8D to 132 points—more than double the number of the second-place competitor. For the 1971 season Hulme&#x27;s teammate was his good friend Peter Revson, who took the Can-Am crown that year with Hulme in second (three wins in ten races), driving the McLaren M8F. In his final season, Hulme drove the McLaren M20 to second place in the 1972 championship on 65 points, with two wins in the nine race season.

Following his quiet start in the 1966 season, Hulme scored 22 wins with 11 second place and 2 third-place finishes in 52 Can-Am races from 1967 through 1972 – standing on the podium for 67% of the races during those six seasons. In those same six seasons, he was the Can-Am season champion twice, and championship runner-up four times. His 22 career wins are the most by any driver in the Can-Am series.

=== Indy 500 ===
Hulme competed in the Indianapolis 500 on four occasions: 1967, 1968, 1969, and 1971. His best results in the event were in 1967 and 1968, both times finishing fourth. He did not compete in the 1970 race, due to methanol burns to the hands after a fire during practice. Hulme was named the 1967 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year.

=== Tasman Series ===
Hulme finished third in the 1964 Tasman Series with one win and three podiums. He would later compete in 1967 and 1968, collecting a podium in each year.

=== British Sportscar Championship (1965–1969)===
On weekends away from the Formula One, Hulme would sometimes race for Sid Taylor Racing in the British Sportscar Championship. During this time, he won a total of 12 races, mostly in a Lola T70, including three RAC Tourist Trophies, one of which was a round of the 1965 World Sportscar Championship.

== After F1 ==
After leaving the sport, Hulme led the GPDA (Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association) for a brief period, but the cut and thrust nature of the post was ill-suited to his gentlemanly nature and he did not fill the post for very long. He then retired to New Zealand, returning to touring cars to race occasionally in the Benson &amp; Hedges 500 race at Pukekohe Park Raceway in the late 1970s first in Chrysler Chargers then later a Volkswagen Golf, partnering Stirling Moss on occasion for the 500 kilometre endurance format.

Hulme began racing regularly again in 1982 with amateur racer Ray Smith, building up a team with the Holden Commodore V8 capable of winning the New Zealand Production Car Series for Group A touring cars in 1983–84. Hulme also started racing in Australia, racing in the team of former European compatriot Frank Gardner&#x27;s JPS Team BMW, which included second in class at the 1984 Bathurst 1000.

Hulme returned to Europe in 1986 racing in the European Touring Car Championship in a Tom Walkinshaw Racing prepared Rover Vitesse. That campaign culminated in a victory in the RAC Tourist Trophy, Hulme&#x27;s fourth win in the event, 18 years after his third win. After that Hulme raced briefly for Bob Jane&#x27;s Mercedes-Benz team before linking up with Larry Perkins in 1987, moving with Perkins in 1988 to the newly formed Holden Racing Team. It was with Holden, that Hulme would record his last visit to a podium, when he finished second, in the 1988 South Australia Cup. Hulme would later join Benson &amp; Hedges Racing, another team run by Frank Gardner in 1990. In the meantime, Hulme was a keen enthusiast of truck racing, which became popular in New Zealand in the early 1990s running Scania trucks, returning to Europe to race in European Truck Championship.

== Death ==
A favourite event of Hulme&#x27;s was the Bathurst 1000, held at the Mount Panorama track in Australia. In the 1992 event he was driving a semi-works supported BMW M3 for Benson &amp; Hedges Racing when after complaining over the car-to-pits radio of blurred vision (originally thought to be because of the heavy rain) Hulme suffered a massive heart attack at the wheel whilst driving along the high-speed Conrod Straight. After veering into the wall on the left side of the track at about , he managed to bring the car to a relatively controlled stop sliding against the safety railing and concrete wall on the right side of the track. When marshals reached the scene, they found Hulme still strapped in. He was taken from the car straight to Bathurst Hospital where he was officially pronounced dead.

According to his sister Anita, Hulme&#x27;s health began deteriorating after the death of his 21-year-old son, Martin Clive, on Christmas Day, 1988, at Lake Rotoiti in the Bay of Plenty. &quot;He was so upset after Martin’s death&quot;, says Anita. &quot;He used to go and sit in the cemetery. I know that he died of a broken heart&quot;.

<doc id="262935" wikidata="Q377781" url="?curid=262935" title="Erasistratus">
<text>Erasistratus (; ; c. 304 – c. 250 BC) was a Greek anatomist and royal physician under Seleucus I Nicator of Syria. Along with fellow physician Herophilus, he founded a school of anatomy in Alexandria, where they carried out anatomical research. As well, he is credited with helping to found the methodic school of teachings of medicine in Alexandria whilst opposing traditional humoral theories of Hippocratic ideologies. Together with Herophilus, he is credited by historians as the potential founder of neuroscience due to his acknowledgements of nerves and their roles in motor control through the brain and skeletal muscles. 

Furthermore, Erasistratus is seen as one of the first physicians/scientists to conduct recorded dissections and potential vivisections alongside Herophilus. The two physicians were said by several Roman authors, notably Augustine, Celsus, and Tertullian, to have performed controversial vivisections on criminals to study the anatomy and possible physiology of human organs while they were in Alexandria. Because of their research, Erasistratus and Herophilus were heavily criticized for their utilization of vivisections; specifically, by the author Tertullian who followed Christian values. Erasistratus and Herophilus are thought to be the only physicians to perform systematic dissections on the human body until the Renaissance. 

Erasistratus is credited for his description of the valves of the heart, and he also concluded that the heart was not the center of sensations, but that it instead functioned as a pump. He was among the first to distinguish between veins and arteries, believing that the arteries were full of air and that they carried the &quot;animal spirit&quot; (&quot;pneuma&quot;). He considered atoms to be the essential body element, and he believed they were vitalized by the &quot;pneuma&quot; that circulated through the nerves. He also thought that the nerves moved a nervous spirit from the brain. He then differentiated between the function of the sensory and motor nerves, and linked them to the brain. He is credited with one of the first in-depth descriptions of the cerebrum and cerebellum. Erasistratus is regarded by some as the founder of physiology.

==Life==
Erasistratus is generally supposed to have been born at Ioulis on the island of Ceos, though Stephanus of Byzantium refers to him as a native of Cos; Galen, as a native of Chios; and the emperor Julian, as a native of Samos. Pliny says he was the grandson of Aristotle by his daughter Pythias, but this is not confirmed by any other ancient writer; and according to the Suda, he was the son of Cretoxena, the sister of the physician Medius, and Cleombrotus. From the latter it is not quite clear whether Cleombrotus was his father or his uncle. He was a pupil of Chrysippus of Cnidos, Metrodorus, and apparently Theophrastus.

He lived for some time at the court of Seleucus I Nicator, where he acquired great reputation by discovering the disease of Antiochus I Soter, the king&#x27;s eldest son, probably 294 BC. Seleucus in his old age had lately married Stratonice, the young and beautiful daughter of Demetrius Poliorcetes, and she had already borne him one child. Antiochus fell violently in love with his stepmother, but did not disclose his passion, and chose rather to pine away in silence. The physicians were quite unable to discover the cause and nature of his disease, and Erasistratus himself was at a loss at first, till, finding nothing amiss about his body, he began to suspect that it must be his mind which was diseased, and that he might perhaps be in love. Erasistratus confirmed his conjecture when he observed that the skin of Antiochus grew hotter, his colour deeper, and his pulse quicker whenever Stratonice came near him, while none of these symptoms occurred on any other occasion. Accordingly, he told Seleucus that his son&#x27;s disease was incurable, for he was in love, and that it was impossible to gratify his passion. The king wondered what the obstacle could be, and asked who the lady was. &quot;My wife,&quot; replied Erasistratus; upon which Seleucus began to persuade him to give her up to his son. The physician asked him if he would do so himself if it were his wife that the prince was in love with. The king protested that he would most gladly; upon which Erasistratus told him that it was indeed his own wife who had inspired his passion, and that he chose rather to die than to disclose his secret. Seleucus was as good as his word, and not only gave up Stratonice, but also resigned to his son several provinces of his empire. This celebrated story is told with variations by many ancient authors, and a similar anecdote has been told of Hippocrates, Galen, Avicenna, and (if the names be not fictitious) Panacius and Acestinus. If this is the anecdote referred to by Pliny, as is probably the case, Erasistratus is said to have received one hundred talents for being the means of restoring the prince to health, which would amount to one of the largest medical fees upon record.

Very little more is known of the personal history of Erasistratus: he lived for some time at Alexandria, which was at that time beginning to be a celebrated medical school, and gave up practice in his old age, that he might pursue his anatomical studies without interruption. He and fellow physician Herophilus practiced anatomy with great success, and with such ardour that they are supposed to have dissected criminals alive. These criminals were supposedly supplied by the king at the request of Herophilus. By conducting these dissections on live subjects they were able to see the true color and shape of internal organs that were not present in deceased subjects. However, conducting these vivisections did not lead to the discovery that there was blood and not just pneuma present in the arteries, which should have been evident in dissecting a live person. Erasistratus appears to have died in Asia Minor, as the Suda mentions that he was buried by mount Mycale in Ionia. The exact date of his death is not known, but he probably lived to a good old age, as, according to Eusebius, he was alive 258 BC, about forty years after the marriage of Antiochus and Stratonice. He had numerous pupils and followers, and a medical school bearing his name continued to exist at Smyrna in Ionia nearly till the time of Strabo, about the beginning of the 1st century. The following are the names of the most celebrated physicians belonging to the sect founded by him: Apoemantes, Apollonius Memphites, Apollophanes Artemidoras, Athenion, Charidemus, Chrysippus, Heraclides of Smyrna, Hermogenes, Hicesius, Martialius, Menodorus, Ptolemaeus, Strato, Xenophon. An attack on Erasistratus and his followers is preserved in Anonymus Londinensis.

==Medicine==
Erasistratus wrote many works on anatomy, practical medicine and pharmacy, of which only the titles remain, together with a great number of short fragments preserved by Galen, Caelius Aurelianus, and other ancient writers. These, however, are sufficient to enable us to form a reasonable idea of his opinions both as a physician and an anatomist. It is as an anatomist that he is most celebrated, and perhaps there is not one ancient physician that did more to promote that branch of medical science than he.

He appears to have been very near the discovery of the circulation of the blood, for in a passage preserved by Galen he says:

The vein arises from the part where the arteries, that are distributed to the whole body, have their origin, and penetrates to the sanguineous [or right] ventricle [of the heart]; and the artery [or pulmonary vein] arises from the part where the veins have their origin, and penetrates to the pneumatic [or left] ventricle of the heart.
The description is not very clear, but seems to show that he supposed the venous and arterial systems to be more intimately connected than was generally believed. This idea is confirmed by another passage in which he is said to have differed from the other ancient anatomists, who believed that the veins arise from the liver, the arteries arise from the heart and the heart is the origin both of the veins and the arteries. With these ideas, it can have been only his belief that the arteries contained air and not blood, that hindered his anticipating Harvey&#x27;s discovery. These views also supported his belief that blood production started in the liver, and not the heart. Erasistratus had a theory that if an artery was traumatized then it would be possible however to find blood at that point, not due to blood being present within the artery itself, but rather because of the body functioning like a vacuum. When a hole would form in an artery, it would create a vacuum that would pull blood into it from a nearby vein. With his discovery of the functioning of the four main valves of the heart, he saw that when material is moved out of the heart, new material moves in, but this does not happen constantly like a water pipe. Once material has left the heart it can not come back in, and material that has entered the heart can not flow back out in the same direction. This is accomplished by membranes that open and close their mouths on the valves of the heart. However, according to Erasistratus the material moving through these valves is pneuma. The tricuspid valves of the heart are generally said to have derived their name from Erasistratus. This, however, appears to be an oversight, as Galen attributes it not to him, but to one of his followers. Erasistratus also made observations on the morphology of the heart, describing the pulmonary artery and the aorta to have a sigmoid shape, a name which is still used presently.

Erasistratus also appears to have paid particular attention to the anatomy of the brain, and in a passage from his works preserved by Galen he speaks as if he had himself dissected a human brain. Galen says that before Erasistratus had more closely examined into the origin of the nerves, he imagined that they arose from the &quot;dura mater&quot; and not from the substance of the brain; and that it was not until he was advanced in life that he satisfied himself by actual inspection that such was not the case. According to Rufus of Ephesus, he divided the nerves into those of sensation and those of motion, of which the former he considered to be hollow and to arise from the membranes of the brain and the latter from the substance of the brain itself and of the cerebellum.

He asserted that the spleen, the bile, and several other parts of the body, were entirely useless to animals. Erasistratus believed that fluids, when drunk, passed through the esophagus into the stomach. During his time, there was controversy that was carried on as to whether fluids when drunk passed through the &quot;trachea&quot; into the lungs, or through the esophagus into the stomach. He is also supposed to have been the first person who added to the word &quot;arteria&quot;, which had hitherto designated the canal leading from the mouth to the lungs, the epithet &quot;tracheia&quot;, to distinguish it from the arteries, and hence to have been the originator of the modern name trachea. He attributed the sensation of hunger to emptiness of the stomach, and said that the Scythians were accustomed to tie a belt tightly round their middle, to enable them to abstain from food for a longer time without suffering inconvenience.

The &quot;pneuma&quot; (spiritual substance) played a very important part both in his system of physiology and pathology: he supposed it to enter the lungs by the trachea, thence to pass by the pulmonary veins into the heart, and thence to be diffused throughout the whole body by means of the arteries; that the use of respiration was to fill the arteries with air; and that the pulsation of the arteries was caused by the movements of the &quot;pneuma&quot;. He accounted for diseases in the same way, and supposed that as long as the &quot;pneuma&quot; continued to fill the arteries and the blood was confined to the veins, the individual was in good health; but that when the blood from some cause or other got forced into the arteries, inflammation and fever was the consequence.

Of his method of cure the most remarkable peculiarity was his aversion to bloodletting and purgative medicines: he seems to have relied chiefly on diet and regimen, bathing, exercise, friction, and the most simple vegetables. Erasistratus was against bloodletting likely due to his theory of plethora. This was a medical term that was commonly used in Hellanistic Greece, and Erasistratus believed it was where one&#x27;s body parts were full of undigested fragments of food, causing the body to then function improperly. This theory of plethora then was why many of his treatments pertained to diet, fasting, and use of drugs that would change digestion. In surgery he was celebrated for the invention of a catheter that bore his name, and which was S-shaped.

Much to the disagreement that Galen had towards Erasistratus&#x27;s views regarding phlebotomy, the Alexandrian physician was said by Galen in his work entitled, &quot;Bloodletting, against the Erasistrateans at Rome,&quot; to have disregarded the importance of the practice and rather suggested alternative methods. Notably, Erasistratus suggests the bandaging of a patient&#x27;s armpits and groin to achieve the desired results associated with phlebotomy. Galen continues in his work to highly criticize this viewpoint that the Alexandrian physician had regarding the medical practice, and points out that Erasistratus did not give enough evidence to support the avoidance of phlebotomy for other treatments.

== Association with Herophilus and Galen ==

Erasistratus is frequently mentioned in historical documents with other significant figures of both his time period of the 3rd and 4th century BC and afterwards thanks to his accomplishments and advancements in the field of medicine. The most prominent person he is referenced with from when he was living was that of Herophilus, another physician that was an important part of ancient Alexandrian medicine with Erasistratus. Together, Erasistratus and Herophilus attributed to the revolutionary growth of knowledge in the Hellenistic period in not only science but culture as well in accordance to the writings of historians of antiquity. Although, it is noted that Erasistratus and Herophilus did not share similar ideologies in the science of medicine as well as its practice. One topic the two disagreed on what substance was actually carried by the arteries. Herophilus believed that the arteries carried a mixture of pneuma and blood, while Erasistratus believed that they solely carried pneuma. Erasistratus is said to have natural philosophical views as compared to others during the time, paving the way for the teaching of methodologists in the field of medicine. The publications of some of Galen&#x27;s work, from which there are many mentions of Erasistratus and Herophilus, led to further understanding of the differing ideologies.

Erasistratus and Galen both supported the theory of pneuma, however their beliefs on how pneuma acquired the air it needed differed. Erasistratus believed that pneuma received the air it needed from the lungs. Galen agreed that air from the lungs was used for pneuma, however in expelling also as much air as was breathed in there wasn&#x27;t enough air present to account for all the pneuma needed to function. Galen also believed that air was brought in through pores of the skin, and through the nose which would move to the bony cavities of the brain to be used as psychic pneuma.

Galen also noted his disagreement with Erasistratus and Herophilus on their view of the composition of organic bodies. They adopted an Aristotelian view of organic bodies consisting of three levels: elements, uniform, and non-uniform parts. Elements consisted of the elements, earth, wind, water, and fire. Uniform parts consisted of the nature of animals such as bone and flesh. Finally, non-uniform parts of nature were things such as a face or hand. Erasistratus and Herophilus believed that doctors should concern themselves with the uniform and non-uniform levels of the body, but not elements as that was the job of philosophers and scientists. This coincides with the role placed on physicians of the time to not act as scientists. Galen however, believed that to understand the human body one had to understand the mixture of its elements.

Much of what is known of Erasistratus and that of his work he did in the 3rd and 4th BC has become known through the work done by Galen. Galen frequently notes the past ideas that had become prevalent from the work of Erasistratus when comparing it to that of his work and ideas. Some historians have suggested that due to Erasistratus&#x27;s disagreements with the ideologies found within Hippocratic teachings and beliefs, as well as notably phlebotomy, that Galen seems to ridicule some work that Erasistratus had synthesized. However, there are numerous times that Galen backs the ideas of Erasistratus as well, leading to opposing claims that Galen was generally negative when discussing the ideologies produced by Erasistratus.

== Downfall and loss of influence after death ==
By the time both Erasistratus and Herophilus had died, the empiricist school of medicine in Alexandria reigned as the most widely accepted ideology and method for practicing medicine for several centuries. One notable event that historians credit to downfall of Erasistratus&#x27;s ideas and influence was that of the Syrian War that occurred from 246–241 BC due to its negative effect on the Alexandrian society, reducing its ability to fund programs that would continue the teachings of Erasistratus. Although, even before the Syrian War devastated the culture and economy of the Alexandrian society, Ptolemy Malefactor in 145 BC negatively impacted the continuation of Erasistratus&#x27;s teachings and ideas, as well as other Alexandrian teachings, as he pushed for Alexandrian intelligentsia to be removed from the Alexandrian society completely. Ultimately, the destruction of many works, including that of Erasistratus and Herophilus, because of a fire that erupted at the great library in 391 AD may have been the greatest reason why there are limited sources of material to understand the teachings and work of Erasistratus outside that of the references to the Alexandrian physician from Galen&#x27;s writings. Furthermore, it may also be the event that resulted in none of Erasistratus&#x27;s original writing remaining.

== Discovery of information regarding the Alexandrian physicians ==
Much of the documentation of the works of Erasistratus and Herophilus was undiscovered until the late 20th century, so the importance of Erasistratus in the advancement of medical knowledge was not fully understood. The only substantial collection of information about their work was several fragments of their writings assembled by K.F.H. Marx and R. Fuchs from German texts. Before that, nearly the only way to learn about the work was by analyzing Galen&#x27;s works, which mention Erasistratus. Similar sets of fragmented texts were also collected in English by J.F. Dobson. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, H. von Staden and Garofalo also found many important sources of information on the Alexandrian physicians.

<text>Joseph Tabrar (5 November 1857 – 22 August 1931) was a prolific English writer of popular music hall songs. His song &quot;Daddy Wouldn&#x27;t Buy Me a Bow Wow&quot; (1892) became Vesta Victoria&#x27;s first major popular success.

==Biography==

Tabrar was born in Clerkenwell, London; his father was a gas fitter, George Tabrar. Joseph Tabrar began his musical career in the church choir. By the age of 13 he was singing at Evans Music-and-Supper Rooms. He performed in music halls as a clown and acrobat as well as a musician, and for some years was a member of the Moore and Burgess Minstrels who performed regularly at St James&#x27;s Hall in Piccadilly. His brother Tom and sister Lizzie also became music hall entertainers.

Tadrar soon became recognised by performers as a songwriter. In 1880, his song &quot;I Am a Millionaire&quot; was performed by George Leybourne and became successful, and by 1881 Tabrar was describing himself in the census as an &quot;author and composer&quot;. He wrote Leybourne&#x27;s 1883 success &quot;Ting Ting, That&#x27;s How the Bell Goes&quot;, and wrote and composed songs for pantomimes performed at the Pavilion Theatre, Whitechapel, including &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; (1884), &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1892), &quot;Sindbad the Sailor&quot; (1893), &quot;Whittington and His Cat&quot; (1895), and &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; (1897).

His 1892 song &quot;Daddy Wouldn&#x27;t Buy Me a Bow Wow&quot; was originally written for Ada Reeve, but when Vesta Victoria heard it she immediately started to perform it, to great success. His other successes included &quot;The Ship Went Down&quot; (1898, performed by Harry Rickards), &quot;For Months and Months and Months&quot; (1909, performed by Jack Smiles), as well as many songs performed by Charles Godfrey, Marie Lloyd, George Robey, and others.

He established his office in Stamford Street, Waterloo. Over his 60-year songwriting career, Tabrar wrote thousands of songs, many of them written to order; he is known to have written 7,200 songs, but claimed to have written more than twice that number. According to Peter Gammond: &quot;There was hardly a music hall artist during his time who did not call upon &#x27;Joe&#x27; for some material: this included, besides songs, monologues, duologues, sketches, short operettas, and many pantomime scripts...&quot;.

His son Joseph, who performed as Fred Earle, became a popular comic and music hall entertainer. The elder Joseph Tabrar continued to write songs, and teach songwriting skills, from his office until after the First World War. He made relatively little money from his songs and in 1899 described himself as &quot;impecuniously embarrassed&quot;; a benefit concert was held with such performers as Dan Leno, G. H. Chirgwin, and Florrie Forde. In 1916, a second benefit concert was arranged to provide financial support, but it was poorly attended.

He died in Camberwell in 1931, aged 73. Tabrar is buried in the former VABF memorial at Streatham Park Cemetery, which has been restored by The Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America.

==Songs==
Tabrar&#x27;s songs include:

<text>Mary Hopkin (born 3 May 1950), credited on some recordings as Mary Visconti from her marriage to Tony Visconti, is a Welsh singer best known for her 1968 UK number 1 single &quot;Those Were the Days&quot;. She was one of the first artists to be signed to the Beatles&#x27; Apple label.

==Life and career==
===Early life and singing career===
Hopkin was born into a Welsh-speaking family in Pontardawe, Glamorgan, Wales. She took weekly singing lessons as a child and began her musical career as a folk singer with a local group called the Selby Set and Mary. She released an EP of Welsh-language songs for a local record label called Cambrian, based in her hometown, before signing to Apple Records, owned by the Beatles, one of the first artists to do so. The model Twiggy saw her winning the ITV television talent show &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; and recommended her to Paul McCartney.
Her debut single, &quot;Those Were the Days&quot;, produced by McCartney, was released in the UK on 30 August 1968. Despite competition from well-established star Sandie Shaw, whose own single version of the song was also released that year, Hopkin&#x27;s version became a number 1 hit on the UK Singles Chart. It reached number 2 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, where for three weeks it was held out of the top spot by the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, and spent two weeks at number 1 on Canada&#x27;s &quot;RPM&quot; singles chart. It sold over 1,500,000 copies in the United States alone, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. Global sales topped 8,000,000.

On 2 October 1968, Hopkin appeared at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London for the &quot;Pop Experience&quot;, where she sang &quot;Morning of My Life&quot;, &quot;Turn Turn Turn&quot; and &quot;Plaisir d&#x27;amour&quot;. In December that year, the &quot;NME&quot; music magazine reported that Hopkin was considering a lead acting role in Stanley Baker&#x27;s planned film &quot;Rape of the Fair Country&quot;, which was to be based on Alexander Cordell&#x27;s book of the same name. That particular project did not materialise but Hopkin did sing the title songs to two of Baker&#x27;s films, &quot;Where&#x27;s Jack?&quot; and &quot;Kidnapped&quot;.

On 21 February 1969, Hopkin&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Post Card&quot;, again produced by McCartney, was released. It included covers of three songs from Donovan, who also played on the album, and one song each from George Martin and Harry Nilsson. It reached number 3 on the UK Albums Chart, although it proved to be her solitary success in that chart. In the United States, &quot;Post Card&quot; reached number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart.

The next single was &quot;Goodbye&quot;, written by McCartney (credited to Lennon–McCartney), and released on 26 March 1969. It reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 15 on the &quot;RPM&quot; chart in Canada. Hopkin said she interpreted &quot;Goodbye&quot; as McCartney pledging to stop &quot;micromanaging&quot; her career, since she was uncomfortable with his positioning of her as a pop chanteuse. She also expressed dissatisfaction with her manager at this time, Terry Doran.

Hopkin&#x27;s third single, &quot;Temma Harbour&quot;, was a re-arrangement of a Philamore Lincoln song. Her first single not to be produced by McCartney, it was released on 16 January 1970 and peaked at number 6 in the UK and number 42 in Canada. In the US, &quot;Temma Harbour&quot; reached number 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 4 on the magazine&#x27;s Easy Listening chart. Along with Donovan and Billy Preston, Hopkin was one of the chorus singers on the Radha Krishna Temple&#x27;s 1970 hit single &quot;Govinda&quot;, produced by George Harrison for Apple Records.

===Eurovision===
In March 1970, Hopkin represented the United Kingdom in the 1970 Eurovision Song Contest, achieving second place with &quot;Knock, Knock Who&#x27;s There?&quot; Despite being the pre-contest favourite, Hopkin lost to &quot;All Kinds of Everything&quot;, performed by Irish singer Dana. Produced by Mickie Most, &quot;Knock, Knock Who&#x27;s There?&quot; was released as a single on 23 March 1970 and peaked at number 2 in the UK. It was a worldwide hit, selling over a million.

Hopkin&#x27;s final big hit was &quot;Think About Your Children&quot;, released in October 1970, which reached number 19 in the UK. Hopkin has expressed dissatisfaction with the material produced by Most, who had taken over as her producer with &quot;Temma Harbour&quot;. After appearing in Eurovision, Hopkin wanted to return to her folk-music roots.

===After Eurovision===
At McCartney&#x27;s insistence, Hopkin had recorded a cover of &quot;Que Sera, Sera&quot; in August 1969. Hopkin had no wish to record the song and refused to have the single released in Britain. Initially issued in France in September 1969, it was released in North America in June 1970. The single peaked at number 77 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 47 in Canada, and was also a hit in Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Rhodesia.

The last single to hit the British charts was &quot;Let My Name Be Sorrow&quot;, which reached number 46 in July 1971. It was produced by Tony Visconti, whom Hopkin had met earlier for a Welsh recording of &quot;Sparrow&quot;. &quot;Let My Name Be Sorrow&quot; was a hit in Poland in January 1972.

Hopkin&#x27;s second album, &quot;Earth Song/Ocean Song&quot;, was released by Apple on 1 October 1971. The album was produced by Visconti and included cover versions of songs written by Cat Stevens, Gallagher and Lyle and Ralph McTell, as well as the two title tracks by Liz Thorsen. Hopkin felt it was the album she had always wanted to make, so, coinciding with her marriage to Visconti and with little left to prove, she left the music scene. The album&#x27;s single, &quot;Water, Paper and Clay&quot;, missed the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It was Hopkin&#x27;s last single for Apple Records, which she left in March 1972.

After Hopkin&#x27;s departure from Apple, a compilation album titled &quot;Those Were the Days&quot; was released in the latter part of 1972. The album featured all of Hopkin&#x27;s hits but failed to chart. &quot;Knock Knock, Who&#x27;s There?&quot; was released as a single in the United States and Canada, both countries having been excluded from the first release of that record in 1970. The single reached number 92 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 11 on the Easy Listening chart in December 1972, giving Hopkin her last US hit.

===Television series===
Following her appearance in the Eurovision contest, Hopkin had her own peak time TV series, &quot;Mary Hopkin in the Land of ...&quot;, on BBC1. Created by Eric Merriman, each episode featured Hopkin looking at a different aspect of storytelling through music and dance. The six 30-minute programmes were broadcast in 1970 and were repeated in 1971.

===After the hit singles===
After marrying Visconti in 1971, Hopkin withdrew from the pop-music scene to have a family. Although reportedly unhappy with show business, she did not stop recording. She travelled to Australia with Visconti in January 1972 and performed at a large outdoor rock festival in South Australia, in addition to giving concerts in several major cities. In March, Hopkin announced her departure from Apple Records; her manager, Jo Lustig, said they were considering offers from &quot;three major [record] companies&quot;. In June, the single &quot;Summertime Summertime&quot; / &quot;Sweet and Low&quot; was released on Bell Records under the name of Hobby Horse. The A-side was a cover of a 1958 song by the Jamies. With Visconti&#x27;s assistance, she released the 1972 Christmas single &quot;Mary Had a Baby&quot; / &quot;Cherry Tree Carol&quot; on Regal Zonophone Records.

Hopkin starred in her own one-off TV special for BBC1 on 29 July 1972. Titled &quot;Sing Hi, Sing Lo&quot;, it was billed simply as &quot;light entertainment starring Mary Hopkin&quot;.

Although no other singles or albums came out in her name until 1976, she sang on numerous recordings that her husband produced, such as those featuring Tom Paxton, Ralph McTell, David Bowie (&quot;Low&quot;), Bert Jansch, the Radiators from Space, Thin Lizzy, Carmen, the Sarstedt Brothers, Osibisa, Sparks, Hazel O&#x27;Connor and Elaine Paige. On all of these recordings (and also on her husband&#x27;s own &quot;Inventory&quot; album) she is credited as &quot;Mary Visconti&quot;. During this time, she also appeared on various TV shows, such as Cilla Black&#x27;s, as well as various radio programmes.

===Return to recording===
In 1976, she returned to recording under her birth name and released the single &quot;If You Love Me (Really Love Me)&quot; (originally recorded by Édith Piaf as &quot;Hymne à l&#x27;amour&quot;), which reached number 32 in the UK chart. The B-side, &quot;Tell Me Now&quot;, was an original composition by Hopkin. Her next single was &quot;Wrap Me in Your Arms&quot;, with the B-side again written by Hopkin (&quot;Just A Dreamer&quot;). These singles came out on Visconti&#x27;s Good Earth Records label. Several songs recorded for an album at the time have now been released under Hopkin&#x27;s own label, Mary Hopkin Music.

Two members of Steeleye Span (Bob Johnson and Pete Knight) chose Hopkin to play &quot;Princess Lirazel&quot; on their concept album &quot;The King of Elfland&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. She also appeared at the Cambridge Folk Festival with Bert Jansch. In 1976, her second child was born. Before the 1970s ended, Decca released a compilation album of Hopkin&#x27;s Cambrian recordings, &quot;The Welsh World of Mary Hopkin&quot;.

===1980s===

Hopkin&#x27;s first project in the 1980s was a well-reviewed stint playing the Virgin Mary in &quot;Rock Nativity&quot; at the Hexagon Theatre in Reading, Berkshire. After this, Mike Hurst (record producer and formerly of the Springfields) asked her to sing lead in a new group named Sundance that he had formed with Mike de Albuquerque of ELO. Their only single, &quot;What&#x27;s Love&quot;, allowed them to tour the UK with Dr. Hook but Hopkin quickly left the group, dissatisfied with the gigs. &quot;What&#x27;s Love&quot; proved very popular in South Africa, albeit the only territory where it charted, peaking at number 10 in April 1982. In 2002, Hurst released recordings from this time on the Angel Air label.

Hopkin and Visconti divorced in 1981. The following year she provided vocals on &quot;Rachael&#x27;s Song&quot; for the Vangelis soundtrack of &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. Around 1984, Peter Skellern asked her to join him and Julian Lloyd Webber in a group called Oasis. Their self-titled and only album, &quot;Oasis&quot;, was released on WEA along with two singles. The album reached number 23 on the UK album chart in 1984 and remained there for 14 weeks. A tour of the UK was planned but was brought to an abrupt end because Hopkin became ill. The group disbanded shortly afterwards.

During the 1980s, Hopkin appeared in several charity shows, including an appearance at the London Palladium with Ralph McTell. In 1988, she took part in George Martin&#x27;s production of Dylan Thomas&#x27; &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. She played the character Rosie Probert and performed a piece called &quot;Love Duet&quot; with Freddie Jones as Captain Cat. The making of the record was filmed and made into a special edition of &quot;The South Bank Show&quot;, where Hopkin and Jones were shown rehearsing and recording &quot;Love Duet&quot;. In 1992, the cast reunited for a performance of the play as a tribute to Thomas in the presence of Prince Charles for The Prince&#x27;s Trust.

Hopkin recorded an album called &quot;Spirit&quot; in 1989. This was released on the Trax label and is a collection of light classical songs and featured the single &quot;Ave Maria&quot;. The record was produced by Benny Gallagher, of Gallagher and Lyle, who had contributed songs to her during her days at Apple Records.

===1990s===
Early in 1990, Hopkin sang with the Chieftains at the London Palladium in a charity show and later joined them on a tour of the UK.

She continued to do projects of her choosing, working with people such as Julian Colbeck; she wrote the lyrics and performed a song on his CD &quot;Back to Bach&quot;. Also, there was Marc Cerrone&#x27;s &quot;The Collector&quot;, a stage play/opera for which she performed two songs on the CD and video. She worked again with old friends, the guitarist Brian Willoughby and Dave Cousins (of Strawbs) on their CD &quot;The Bridge&quot;. She also appeared on a Beatles&#x27; tribute album by RAM Pietsch.
In 1996, the Welsh label Sain bought Cambrian&#x27;s back catalogue and released all of Hopkin&#x27;s Welsh recordings on a CD called &quot;Y Caneuon Cynnar/The Early Recordings&quot;, which removed the overdubbed drums found on the Decca recordings.

In 1999, she again joined the Chieftains on their UK tour and, later that year, performed concerts in Scotland with Benny Gallagher and Jim Diamond. There were also three TV documentaries about her, one each for HTV (1998), BBC Television (1998) and S4C (2000).

She made a guest appearance on the Crocketts&#x27; album &quot;The Great Brain Robbery&quot;, sang the theme song for Billy Connolly&#x27;s BBC TV series &quot;World Tour of England, Ireland and Wales&quot; and re-recorded &quot;Those Were The Days&quot; with Robin Williams rapping. She also appeared in the Sara Sugarman film &quot;Very Annie Mary&quot;.

===2000s===
In September 2005, she released a retrospective album on the Mary Hopkin Music a label run by her daughter entitled &quot;Live at the Royal Festival Hall 1972&quot;. It was followed in December 2006 by a Christmas recording, &quot;Snowed Under&quot;, released on download only.

To celebrate her 57th birthday in 2007, she released an album called &quot;Valentine&quot; on her new eponymous label. It included 12 previously unheard tracks dating from 1972 to 1980, three of which were written by Hopkin. In 2008, a new album, &quot;Recollections&quot;, was released on her own label. It included 11 tracks that were originally recorded between 1970 and 1986, alongside a CD of three Christmas songs which included &quot;Mary Had a Baby&quot; and &quot;The Cherry-Tree Carol&quot; (these tracks were first released on Regal Zonophone in 1972) and &quot;Snowed Under&quot;, which was released in 2006 as a download only.

Her final archival CD, &quot;Now and Then&quot;, was released in May 2009. It comprises 14 tracks recorded between 1970 and 1988. She sang the song &quot;Y &#x27;deryn pur&quot; (&quot;Gentle Bird&quot;) on the album &quot;Blodeugerdd: Song of the Flowers – An Anthology of Welsh Music and Song&quot; released by Smithsonian Folkways Recordings in June 2009.

===2010s===
Hopkin&#x27;s daughter, Jessica Lee Morgan, released her first CD, called &quot;I Am Not&quot;, on which Hopkin sings on several songs.

In October 2010, Hopkin and her son, Morgan Visconti, released &quot;You Look Familiar&quot;, a collaboration which brings together Hopkin&#x27;s melodies, lyrics and vocals with her son&#x27;s instrumentation and arrangements.

In 2013, &quot;Painting by Numbers&quot; was released on Mary Hopkin Music. The album includes 10 tracks written by Hopkin, two of which are co-written with friends; &quot;Love Belongs Right Here&quot; with Brian Willoughby and &quot;Love, Long Distance&quot; with Benny Gallagher.

For Christmas 2014, Hopkin recorded a single with her son and daughter. The traditional carol, &quot;Iesu Faban&quot; (meaning &quot;Baby Jesus&quot; in Welsh), was described on her website as a &quot;close, intimate choral performance of a traditional Welsh Christmas carol&quot;.

To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of &quot;Those Were the Days&quot;, on 30 August 2018 Hopkin released a new acoustic version, on an EP also featuring the live version from her 1972 &quot;farewell&quot; concert at the Royal Festival Hall.

<text>Taglish or Englog is code-switching and/or code-mixing in the use of Tagalog and English, the most common languages of the Philippines. The words &quot;Taglish&quot; and &quot;Englog&quot; are portmanteaus of the words &quot;Tagalog&quot; and &quot;English&quot;. The earliest use of the word &quot;Taglish&quot; dates back to 1973, while the less common form &quot;Tanglish&quot; is recorded from 1999.

Taglish is widely used in the Philippines, but is also used by Filipinos in overseas communities. It also has several variants, including Coño English, Jejemon and Swardspeak.

==Description==
Taglish is very widespread in the Philippines and has become the de facto lingua franca among the urbanized and/or educated middle class. It is largely considered the &quot;normal acceptable conversation style of speaking and writing&quot; in informal settings. It is so widespread that a non-native speaker can be identified easily because they predominantly speak Tagalog, whereas a native speaker would switch freely with English.

According to the linguist Maria Lourdes S. Bautista, there are two contrasting types of code-switching in the Philippines: deficiency-driven and proficiency-driven. Deficiency-driven code-switching occurs when those who are not competent in one language must thus switch back to the language that is more familiar. That is common among younger children, as in the example below given by Bautista:

Proficiency-driven code-switching, on the other hand, occurs when a person is fully competent in both languages being used and can switch between them easily. That is the main type of code-switching in the islands. This example is given by Bautista, taken from an interview with the television journalist Jessica Soho:

Proficiency-driven code-switching is characterized by frequent switching of the Matrix Language (ML) between Tagalog and English, demonstrating the high proficiency of the speakers in both languages. There are also a wide range of strategies involved, including: the formation of bilingual verbs by the addition of prefixes, suffixes, and infixes (e.g. Nagse-&quot;sweat&quot; ako = &quot;I was sweating&quot;); switching at the morphological, word, phrasal, or clausal levels; and the use of system morphemes (like enclitics, conjunctions, etc.) within long stretches of ML content; and even the inversion of the verb–subject–object word order of Tagalog into the subject-verb-object order of English.

According to Bautista, the reason for this type of code-switching is what she termed &quot;communicative efficiency&quot; in which a speaker can &quot;convey meaning using the most accurate, expressive, or succinct lexical items available to them.&quot; The linguist Rosalina Morales Goulet also enumerated several reasons for this type of code-switching. They are: &quot;for precision, for transition, for comic effect, for atmosphere, to bridge or create social distance, for snob appeal, and for secrecy.&quot;

==Characteristics==
Taglish was originally a manner of speaking in Metro Manila involving the mixing of Tagalog/Filipino and English together. However, this practice has spread to other areas where both English and Tagalog/Filipino are spoken, including in areas where Tagalog is not the native language. It is characteristically a form of Tagalog/Filipino that mixes in English words, where Tagalog/Filipino is the substratum and English is the superstratum. Next to code-switching between sentences, clauses, and phrases in &quot;pure&quot; Tagalog and English, Taglish speech also code-mixes especially with sentences that follow the rules of Tagalog grammar with Tagalog syntax and morphology, but that occasionally employs English nouns and verbs in place of their Tagalog counterparts. Examples:
 
English verbs and even some nouns can be employed as Tagalog verb roots. This is done by the addition of one or more prefixes or infixes and by the doubling of the first sound of the starting form of the noun or verb, consistent with Tagalog morphology but usually retaining English spelling for the roots.

The English verb &quot;drive&quot; can be changed to the Tagalog word &quot;magda-drive&quot; meaning &quot;will drive&quot; (used in place of the Tagalog word &quot;magmamaneho&quot;). The English noun &quot;Internet&quot; can also be changed to the Tagalog word &quot;nag-Internet&quot; meaning &quot;have used the Internet&quot;.

Taglish also uses sentences of mixed English or Tagalog words and phrases. The conjunctions used to connect them can come from any of the two. Some examples include:

Because of its informal nature, prescriptivists of English and Tagalog discourage its use.

There are examples of modern books in Taglish: the adventure novel &quot;Bullet With A Name&quot; (2018) by Kirsten Nimwey, the love novel &quot;Aeternum Dream&quot; (2018) by Harkin Deximire, and more.

==Forms==
===Swardspeak===
Swardspeak is a kind of Taglish/Englog LGBT slang used by the LGBT demographic of the Philippines. It is a form of slang that uses words and terms primarily from Philippine English, Tagalog/Filipino, and/or Cebuano and Hiligaynon, and occasionally as well as Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Sanskrit, or other languages. Names of celebrities, fictional characters, and trademarks are also often used.

===Coño English===
Coño English (&#x27;) or Colegiala English () is a sociolect of Taglish that originated from the younger generations of affluent families in Manila. The word &quot;coño&quot; or &#x27;, itself came from &quot;.&quot; It is a form of Philippine English that mixes Tagalog/Filipino words, where opposite to Taglish, English is the substratum and Tagalog/Filipino is the superstratum.

The most common aspect of Coño English is the building of verbs by using the English word &quot;make&quot; with the root word of a Tagalog verb:

And adding the English conjunctions &quot;like so&quot; before using a Tagalog adjective to finish the sentence. Examples:
Sometimes, Tagalog interjections such as &quot;ano&quot;, &quot;naman&quot;, &quot;pa&quot;, &quot;na&quot; (or &quot;nah&quot;), &quot;no&quot; (or &quot;noh&quot;), &quot;a&quot; (or &quot;ha&quot;), &quot;e&quot; (or &quot;eh&quot;), and &quot;o&quot; (or &quot;oh&quot;) are placed to add emphasis. &#x27; (contractions from &#x27;) are used for questions and are added only to the end of a sentence. &quot;&quot;, is also used for questions and is placed in the front or the end. It may also be used as an interjection, &quot;no?&quot;, (equal to the Spanish &quot;¿no?&quot; and the German &quot;nicht?&quot;) and is pronounced as or , with a pure vowel instead of the English glide, which shows influence from Spanish in Filipino.

&quot;E&quot;/&quot;Eh&quot; (added to answers to questions) and &quot;o&quot;/&quot;oh&quot; (for statements) are used for exclamations and are added to the front only. &#x27; (not yet; not yet done; to continue; still) and &#x27; can be placed in the middle or end. &quot;&quot; (particle used to soften requests or put emphasis) is placed anywhere.

English adjectives are often replaced with Tagalog verbs. The language also occasionally uses Spanish words or Spanish loanwords from Filipino/Tagalog, like &quot;baño/banyo&quot; (&quot;bathroom&quot;), 
&quot;tostado&quot; (&quot;toasted&quot;) and &quot;jamón&quot; (&quot;ham&quot;).

The perceived feminine sound of Coño English makes male speakers sometimes overuse the &#x27; to make it sound more masculine. Sometimes &#x27; is used instead of &quot;pare&quot; or along with it:

<doc id="262955" wikidata="Q1752783" url="?curid=262955" title="Battle of the Chateauguay">
<text>The Battle of the Chateauguay was an engagement of the War of 1812. On 26 October 1813, a combined British and Canadian force consisting of 1,530 regulars, volunteers, militia and Mohawk warriors from Lower Canada, commanded by Charles de Salaberry, repelled an American force of about 2,600 regulars which was attempting to invade Lower Canada and ultimately attack Montreal.

The Battle of the Chateauguay was one of the two battles (the other being the Battle of Crysler&#x27;s Farm) which caused the Americans to abandon the Saint Lawrence Campaign, their major strategic effort in the autumn of 1813.

==Prelude==
===American plan===
Late in 1813, United States Secretary of War John Armstrong devised a plan to capture Montreal, which might have led to the conquest of all Upper Canada. Two divisions were involved. One would descend the St. Lawrence River from Sackett&#x27;s Harbor on Lake Ontario, while the other would advance north from Plattsburgh on Lake Champlain. The two divisions would unite in front of the city for the final assault.

The Americans around Lake Champlain were led by Major General Wade Hampton, who had taken command on 4 July 1813. Hampton had several misgivings about the plan. His own troops, encamped at Burlington, Vermont, were raw and badly trained, and his junior officers themselves lacked training and experience. There were insufficient supplies at his forward base at Plattsburgh as the British had controlled the lake since 3 June. On that day, two American sloops pursued British gunboats into the Richelieu River and were forced to surrender after the wind dropped and they were trapped by gunboats and artillery firing from the river banks. The British took over the sloops and used them in a raid against a number of settlements around Lake Champlain. In particular, they captured or destroyed quantities of supplies in and around Plattsburgh. Although the British crews and troops involved in the raid were subsequently returned to other duties, the American naval commander on the lake, Lieutenant Thomas Macdonough, was unable to construct a flotilla of sloops and gunboats to counter the British vessels until August.

Hampton, a wealthy southern plantation owner, despised Major General James Wilkinson who commanded the division from Sackett&#x27;s Harbor and who had a reputation for corruption and treacherous dealings with Spain. The two men, who were the two senior generals in the United States Army after the effective retirement of Major General Henry Dearborn on 6 July 1813, had been feuding with each other since 1808. Hampton at first refused to accept orders from Wilkinson, until Armstrong (who had himself moved to Sackett&#x27;s Harbor) arranged that all correspondence regarding the expedition was to pass through the War Department.

===Hampton&#x27;s movements===
On 19 September, Hampton moved by water from Burlington to Plattsburgh, escorted by Macdonough&#x27;s gunboats, and made a reconnaissance in force towards Odelltown on the direct route north from Lake Champlain. He decided that the British forces were too strong in this sector. The garrison of Ile aux Noix, where the British sloops and gunboats were based, numbered about 900 and there were other outposts and light troops in the area. Also, water on this route was short after a summer drought had caused the wells and streams to dry up, though this excuse caused some amusement among Hampton&#x27;s officers as Hampton was known to be fond of drink. Hampton&#x27;s force marched west instead to Four Corners, on the Chateauguay River.

As Wilkinson&#x27;s expedition was not ready, Hampton&#x27;s force waited at Four Corners until 18 October. Hampton was concerned that the delay was depleting his supplies and giving the British time to muster forces against him. Hearing from Armstrong that Wilkinson&#x27;s force was &quot;almost&quot; ready to set out, he began advancing down the Chateauguay River. A brigade of 1,400 New York militia refused to cross the frontier into Canada, leaving Hampton with two brigades of regulars numbering about 2,600 in total, 200 mounted troops and 10 field guns. Large numbers of loaded wagons accompanied the force. Hampton&#x27;s advance was slowed because the bridges across every stream had been destroyed and trees had been felled across the roads (which themselves were little more than tracks).

===Canadian counter-moves===
The Swiss-born Major-General Louis de Watteville was appointed commander of the Montreal District on 17 September. In response to reports of the American advance, he ordered several units of militia called up. Reinforcements (two battalions of the Royal Marines) were also moving up the St. Lawrence from Quebec. The Governor General of Canada, Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost, ordered Lieutenant Colonel George MacDonnell to move from Kingston on Lake Ontario to the front south of Montreal with his 1st Light Battalion of mixed regular and militia companies. Already though, the commander of the outposts, Lieutenant Colonel Charles de Salaberry, had been organising his defences. In addition to his own corps (the Canadian Voltigeurs) and George MacDonnell&#x27;s 1st Light Battalion, he had called in several units of the Select Embodied Militia and local militia units.

De Salaberry had many informants among the farmers in the area who provided accurate information about the strength of Hampton&#x27;s force and its movements, while Hampton had very poor intelligence about De Salaberry&#x27;s force.
*The road along which Hampton was advancing followed the north bank of the Chateauguay. Facing a ravine where a creek (the English River) joined the Chateauguay, de Salaberry ordered abatis (obstacles made of felled trees) to be constructed, blocking the road. Behind these he posted the light company of the Canadian Fencibles under Captain Richard Ferguson (50); two companies of the Canadian Voltigeurs under Captain Michel-Louis Juchereau Duchesnay and his brother Captain Jean-Baptiste Juchereau Duchesnay, totalling about 100 men; a company from the 2nd Battalion Sedentary Beauharnois Militia under Captain Longuetin (about 100) and perhaps two dozen Native Americans (Abenaki, Algonquin and Iroquois) nominally commanded by Captain Lamothe.
*To guard a ford across the Chateauguay behind the abatis, de Salaberry posted the light companies of the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of Select Embodied Militia under Captains de Tonnancoeur and Daly, and another company of Beauharnois militia under Captain Brugière (about 160 in total).
*In successive reserve positions, stretching a mile and a half along the river from the abatis to the ford and beyond, were another two companies of the Canadian Voltigeurs (about 300); the main body of the 2nd Select Embodied Militia (480), 200 more local &quot;sedentary&quot; militia; and another 150 Kahnawake and Mohawks and other Native Americans commanded by Captains Lorimier and Ducharme, among others.

De Salaberry commanded the front line in person, while the reserves were commanded by Lieutenant Colonel MacDonnell.

All of de Salaberry&#x27;s forces were raised in Lower Canada. The Canadian Fencibles were raised as regulars, though liable for service in North America only. The Voltigeurs were volunteers and were treated as regulars for most purposes. The Select Embodied Militia contained some volunteers but consisted mainly of men drafted by ballot for a year&#x27;s full-time service.

De Salaberry had been so confident of victory that he had not informed his superiors of his actions. De Watteville and Sir George Prevost rode forward and &quot;approved&quot; de Salaberry&#x27;s dispositions, even as the fighting started.

==Battle==

Hampton knew of the existence of the ford and, late on 25 October, he decided to send 1,500 men of his first brigade (including most, if not all, of his light infantry) under Colonel Robert Purdy, to cross to the south bank of the Chateauguay, circle round the British position and outflank it by capturing the ford at dawn, while the remainder under Brigadier General George Izard attacked from the front. After Purdy set off, Hampton received a letter from Armstrong, dated 16 October, informing him that Armstrong himself was relinquishing overall command of the combined American forces, leaving Wilkinson in charge. Hampton was also ordered to construct winter quarters for 10,000 men on the Saint Lawrence. Hampton interpreted this instruction to mean that there would be no attack on Montreal that year and the entire campaign was pointless. He would probably have retreated immediately, except that Purdy would then have been left isolated.

Purdy&#x27;s men spent a miserable night marching through swampy woods in pouring rain, becoming quite lost. As dawn broke on 26 October, they located the correct trail, but inexperienced or unwilling guides first led them about mid-morning to a point on the river opposite de Salaberry&#x27;s forward defences. Some time after noon, Purdy&#x27;s brigade encountered the detachment de Salaberry had posted to guard the ford. Captain Daly, leading the light company of the 3rd Select Embodied Militia, launched an immediate attack against the Americans, while other Canadian troops engaged them from across the river. The Americans were thrown into confusion and driven back. Captain Daly and Captain Brugière were severely wounded and their men withdrew, but when the Americans tried to pursue they once again came under fire from the north bank of the Chateauguay and were again thrown into disarray.

After Purdy&#x27;s force had been in action for some time with no obvious signs of American success, Izard&#x27;s force marched into the ravine facing de Salaberry&#x27;s defences and deployed into line. Legend has it that at this point, an American officer rode forward to demand the Canadians&#x27; surrender. As he had omitted to do so under a flag of truce, he was shot down by de Salaberry himself.

Izard&#x27;s troops began steady, rolling volleys into the abatis and trees. These conventional tactics, better suited to pitched battles between regular forces in open terrain, were almost entirely ineffective against the Canadians. The defenders replied with accurate individual fire. Lieutenant Pinguet of the Canadian Fencibles later related &quot;All our men fired from thirty-five to forty rounds so well aimed that the prisoners told us next day that every shot seem to pass at about the height of a man&#x27;s breast or head. Our company was engaged for about three-quarters of an hour before reinforcements came up.&quot; Surprisingly few Americans were hit however. On the Canadian right, the light company of the Fencibles were outflanked and fell back, but either on de Salaberry&#x27;s orders or on their own initiative, MacDonnell and several companies from the reserve were already making their way forward. They did so with bugle calls, cheers and Indian war whoops. De Salaberry is also credited in several accounts with sending buglers into the woods to sound the &quot;Advance&quot; as a ruse de guerre. The unnerved Americans thought themselves outnumbered and about to be outflanked and fell back . Hampton&#x27;s four guns did not come into action.

Purdy first fell back to the river bank opposite De Salaberry&#x27;s front line, expecting to find Izard still in action, so that he could ferry his wounded across the river. Instead, he once again found himself under fire from De Salaberry and was forced to retreat through the woods to his starting-place. Once Purdy had extricated himself after another dismal night in the woods, the American army withdrew in good order. De Salaberry did not pursue.

==Casualties==
De Salaberry reported 5 killed, 16 wounded and 4 missing but 3 of the men who had been returned as &quot;killed&quot; later rejoined the ranks unharmed, giving a revised Canadian loss of 2 killed, 16 wounded and 4 missing. The American losses were officially reported by Hampton&#x27;s Adjutant-General (Colonel Henry Atkinson) as 23 killed, 33 wounded and 29 missing. De Salaberry reported that 16 American prisoners were taken.

==Aftermath==
Having reunited his forces, Hampton held a council of war. This unanimously concluded that a renewed advance stood no chance of success. Furthermore, the roads were becoming impassable under the autumn rains, and Hampton&#x27;s supplies would soon be exhausted. Hampton ordered a withdrawal to Four Corners and sent Colonel Atkinson to Wilkinson with a report of his situation.
Wilkinson&#x27;s own force had reached a settlement named Hoags, on the Saint Lawrence River a few miles upstream from Ogdensburg, when they received this news. Wilkinson replied with orders for Hampton to advance to Cornwall, bringing sufficient supplies for both his own and Wilkinson&#x27;s divisions. When he received these orders, Hampton was convinced that they could not be executed and declined to comply, retreating instead to Plattsburgh. Before Hampton&#x27;s reply could reach Wilkinson, the latter&#x27;s own force was defeated at the Battle of Crysler&#x27;s Farm on 11 November. Wilkinson nevertheless used Hampton&#x27;s refusal to move on Cornwall (which he received by letter on 12 November) as a pretext to abandon his own advance, and the campaign to capture Montreal was called off.

Hampton had already submitted his resignation the day before the battle of Chateauguay, in his reply to Armstrong&#x27;s letter of 16 October. He was not employed again in the field.

On the British side, the victorious troops at Chateauguay held their existing positions and endured much discomfort for several days before Indians reported that the Americans were retreating, which allowed them to retire to more comfortable billets. The hot-tempered de Salaberry was furious that Major General de Watteville and especially Sir George Prevost had arrived on the field too late to take part in the fighting but in time to submit their own dispatches claiming the victory for themselves. He considered resigning his commission but was later officially thanked by the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada. He and Lieutenant Colonel MacDonnell were made Companions of the Bath after the war for their parts in the battle. Sir George Prevost&#x27;s dispatch, which claimed that 300 Canadians had put 7,500 Americans to flight nevertheless contributed to the battle becoming legendary in Canadian folklore.

==Legacy==

Eight currently active regular battalions of the United States Army (1-3 Inf, 2-3 Inf, 4-3 Inf, 1-5 Inf, 2-5 Inf, 1-6 Inf, 2-6 Inf and 4-6 Inf) perpetuate the lineages of several of American infantry regiments (the old 1st, 4th, 25th and 29th Infantry Regiments) that took part in the Battle of the Chateauguay.

Six regiments of the Canadian Army carry the Battle Honour CHATEAUGUAY to commemorate the history and heritage of units that fought at the Battle. They are: The Royal 22e Régiment, the Canadian Grenadier Guards, the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada, Les Voltigeurs de Québec, Les Fusiliers du St-Laurent and Le Régiment de la Chaudière.

The site of the battle was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1920.

<text>Béziers (; ) is a city in southern France. It is a subprefecture of the Hérault department in the Occitanie region. Every August Béziers hosts the famous &quot;Feria de Béziers&quot;, which is centred on bullfighting. A million visitors are attracted to the five-day event.

The town is located on a small bluff above the river Orb, about from the Mediterranean coast and southwest of Montpellier. At Béziers, the Canal du Midi passes over the river Orb by means of the &quot;Pont-canal de l&#x27;Orb&quot;, an aqueduct claimed to be the first of its kind.

==History==
Béziers is one of the oldest cities in France. Research published in March 2013 shows that the ancient Greek colony of Béziers dates from 575 BCE, making it older than Agde (Greek Agathe Tyche, founded in 525 BCE) and slightly younger than Marseille (Greek Massalia, founded in 600 BCE).

The site has been occupied since Neolithic times, before the influx of Celts. Roman &quot;Betarra&quot; was on the road that linked Provence with Iberia. The Romans refounded the city as a new &quot;colonia&quot; for veterans in 36–35 BCE and called it &quot;Colonia Julia Baeterrae Septimanorum&quot;. Stones from the Roman amphitheatre were used to construct the city wall during the third century.

Béziers exported wine to Rome. A &quot;dolium&quot; discovered in an excavation near Rome is marked, &quot;I am a wine from Baeterrae and I am five years old.&quot; Another is simply marked, &quot;white wine of Baeterrae.&quot; Béziers was conquered by the Muslims and remained part of Islamic Iberia between 720 and 752.

From the 10th to the 12th centuries, Béziers was the centre of a Viscountship of Béziers. The viscounts ruled most of the coastal plain around Béziers, including the town of Agde. They also controlled the major east–west route through Languedoc, which roughly follows the old Roman Via Domitia, with the two key bridges over the Orb at Béziers and over the Hérault at Saint-Thibéry.

After the death of Viscount William around 990, the viscounty passed to his daughter Garsendis and her husband, Count Raimond-Roger of Carcassonne (d. 1012). It was then ruled by their son Peter-Raimond (d. c. 1060) and his son Roger (d. 1067), both of whom were also counts of Carcassonne.

Roger died without issue and Béziers passed to his sister Ermengard and her husband Raimond-Bertrand Trencavel. The Trencavels ruled for the next 142 years, until the Albigensian Crusade, a formal crusade (holy war) authorised by Pope Innocent III.

===Massacre at Béziers===

Béziers was a stronghold of Catharism, which the Catholic Church condemned as heretical and exterminated in the Albigensian Crusade.

The crusaders reached Béziers on 21 July 1209. Béziers&#x27; Catholics were given an ultimatum to hand over the heretics or leave before the crusaders besieged the city and to &quot;avoid sharing their fate and perishing with them&quot;. However, many refused and resisted with the Cathars. The town was sacked the following day and in the bloody massacre no one was spared, not even Catholic priests and those who took refuge in the churches.

One of the commanders of the crusade was the Papal legate Arnaud-Amaury (or Arnald Amalaricus, abbot of Citeaux). When asked by a crusader how to tell Catholics from Cathars once they had taken the city, the abbot supposedly replied, &quot;Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius&quot; (&quot;Kill them all, for the Lord knoweth them that are His&quot;). (This oft-quoted phrase is sourced from Caesarius of Heisterbach along with a story of all the heretics who desecrated a copy of the Gospels and threw it down from the town&#x27;s walls.) Amalric&#x27;s own version of the siege, described in his letter to Pope Innocent III in August 1209 (col. 139), states:
While discussions were still going on with the barons about the release of those in the city who were deemed to be Catholics, the servants and other persons of low rank and unarmed attacked the city without waiting for orders from their leaders. To our amazement, crying &quot;to arms, to arms!&quot;, within the space of two or three hours they crossed the ditches and the walls and Béziers was taken. Our men spared no one, irrespective of rank, sex or age, and put to the sword almost 20,000 people. After this great slaughter the whole city was despoiled and burnt ...

The invaders burned the Cathedral of Saint Nazaire, which collapsed on those who had taken refuge inside. The town was pillaged and burnt. By some accounts, none were left alive—by others, there were a handful of survivors. (A plaque opposite the cathedral records the &quot;Day of Butchery&quot; perpetrated by the &quot;northern barons&quot;.)

===Later Middle Ages===

Despite the massacre, the city was repopulated. A few parts of the Romanesque cathedral of St-Nazaire had survived the carnage, and repairs started in 1215. The restoration, along with that of the rest of the city, continued until the 15th century.

Béziers became part of the royal domain in 1247.

A school of troubadours arose at Béziers in the 1260s–80s, with four poets: Bernart d&#x27;Auriac, Joan Esteve, Joan Miralhas, and Raimon Gaucelm. The latter three were natives of Béziers. All four lived there and were members of the urban middle class and no courtesans: Miralhas was possibly a potter and Bernart a teacher. They wrote in Occitan but supported the French king Louis IX and the French aristocracy against the native Occitan nobility, and have been described as &quot;gallicised&quot;. Raimon Gaucelm supported the Eighth Crusade and even wrote a &quot;planh&quot;, the only known one of its kind, to a burgher of Béziers. Joan Esteve and Bernart both composed in support of the French in the Aragonese Crusade. These poets are a shining example of the transformation of Occitania in the aftermath of the Albigensian Crusade, but also of the ability of troubadours to survive it.

Rule of the city was for a long time divided among three powers: the Bishopric, which reached its apogee in the 16th and 17th centuries when it was held by the Bonsi family, allied to the Medici; the consuls, local magistrates created at the end of the 12th century; and finally the king, represented by a &quot;Viguier for judicial affairs&quot;, and from the 17th century onwards by a sub-delegate of the Intendant.

Béziers was not damaged in the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

On 8 September 1381, a riot broke out at the seat of the municipal council, rioters setting the Town House on fire. The councillors tried to take refuge in the tower, but fire spread there as well, and they all died either by fire or in jumping from the tower to the square.

===Early modern times===

King Charles IX passed through the city during his royal tour of France (1564–1566), accompanied by the Court and the great men of the kingdom: his brother Henry, the Duke of Anjou, his distant cousin Henri of Navarre, and the Cardinal of Bourbon with the Cardinal of Lorraine.

In 1551, Béziers became the seat of a seneschal, being removed from the jurisdiction of the seneschals of Carcassonne.

The city served as a rear base during various wars of the modern period, especially those against the Habsburgs. It was only once directly threatened. During the War of the Spanish Succession, the British in 1710 landed at Sète and moved to within a few kilometres of Béziers, before being repulsed by the Duke of Roquelaure. Béziers was at the heart of the Montmorency Revolt in 1632. It was in Béziers that Gaston d&#x27;Orléans and Henri II de Montmorency, Governor of Languedoc, met at the beginning of the rebellion. It was also here that the king, by the Edict of Béziers (October 1632), abolished the privileges of the province. (They were restored in 1649.)

During the 18th century, Béziers prospered, notably thanks to the cultivation of vines which enabled it to become an important centre for alcohol trading.

===French Revolution===

During the French Revolution, citizens of Béziers met in a revolutionary society created in May 1790 and numbering up to 400 members. It had several successive names: first, &quot;The Literary and Patriotic Cabinet&quot;, a name still derived from the social life of the Ancien Régime; it then became &quot;Society of the Friends of the Constitution and Liberty&quot;. Later becoming affiliated to the Jacobin Club of Paris, the Béziers organization was accordingly renamed the &quot;Society of the Jacobins&quot;; then, the abolition of the French monarchy precipitated two further changes of name: &quot;Society of Brothers and Friends of the Republic&quot; and then &quot;Regenerated Society of the Jacobins, Friends of the Republic&quot;.

From 1790 to 1800, Béziers was the chief town of the district of Béziers. The city did not take part in the Girondin (&quot;Federalist&quot;) movement.

===Napoleon the Third, 1851===

In the repression following Louis Napoléon&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état in 1851, troops fired on and killed Republican protesters in Béziers. Others were condemned to death or transported to Guiana, including Casimir Péret, the mayor at the time, who died at sea attempting to escape from there. In the Place de la Révolution a plaque and a monument by Jean Antoine Injalbert commemorates these events. (Injalbert also designed the Fontaine du Titan in Béziers&#x27; Plâteau des Poètes park.)

===The Languedoc vine growers&#x27; revolt in Béziers, 1907===
While elsewhere in France, the area planted with vines was decreasing, it increased in the departments of Aude, Gard, Hérault and the Pyrénées-Orientales. Together, these supplied some 40% of French wine production. Haut Languedoc, and more particularly the Biterrois and Béziers, proclaimed themselves to be &quot;The World Capital of Wine&quot; and grew rapidly. Great fortunes were made. Large landowners, coming from industry, finance or the liberal professions, gained possession of immense vineyards.

There was also a growing foreign competition, with smuggled wines appearing on the market. The fraudsters remained unpunished. In 1892, the winegrowers of the Midi demanded &quot;The restoration and enforcement of customs duties&quot;. But the market remained partly held by wines made from imported dried grapes (such as grapes from Corinth), and wines called &quot;wet&quot; (adulterated with water). Though the vintners attached great importance to this unfair competition, in fact it did not represent more than 5% of the market.

On 12 May 1907, no less than 150,000 protesters gathered in Béziers with the declared aim of &quot;Defending the Southern Viticulture&quot;. The crowd spilled into Paul-Riquet and the Champ-de-Mars. The slogans on the banners Proclaimed: &quot;Victory or death! Enough of talking, the time has come for action! Death to fraudsters! Bread or death! Live by working or die fighting!&quot;.

The demonstrators, who came from more than 200 communes, were joined by numerous Biterrois employees and shopkeepers. The event ended with speeches on the Place de la Citadelle, (now Place Jean-Jaurès). the Speakers included Marcelin Albert who issued an ultimatum to the government, demanding that it raise the price of wine, Ernest Ferroul who advocated tax refusal and the Béziers Mayor Émile Suchon, (close to Clemenceau), who took a stand in support of the winegrowers&#x27; struggle. There were some minor incidents during the dispersal of the demonstrators.

On 16 May, the Béziers municipal council, of Radical and Socialist tendency, resigned. The pressure of the street continued. The police station and the town hall façade were set on fire. Alerted, Georges Clemenceau decided to launch a counterattack. The 17th regiment of line infantry, composed of reservists and conscripts, was on his orders transferred from Béziers to Agde on 18 June 1907.

On the evening of 20 June, learning of the Narbonne shooting, about 500 soldiers of the 6th company of the 17th regiment mutinied, plundered the armory and headed for Béziers. They traveled about twenty kilometers by night. On 21 June, in the early morning, they arrived in town. They were warmly welcomed by the Biterrois, &quot;fraternizing with the demonstrators, and peacefully opposing the armed forces&quot;. The soldiers sat down on the Allées Paul Riquet and the population offered them wine and food.

The South was on the brink of insurrection. In Paulhan, the railway was taken out of commission by protesters who stopped a military convoy sent to quell the mutineers. In Lodève, the sub-prefect was taken hostage. The military authorities were not ready to accept this mutiny, apprehensive that the example of the 17th regiment would give similar ideas to other regiments in the region.

In Paris, the Republic trembled, as Clemenceau had to face a vote of no confidence. However, he survived by letting the military command urgently negotiate with the mutineers. In the afternoon, after obtaining a guarantee that no sanctions will be imposed on them, the 17th soldiers put down their arms and marched to the station under escort, without any major incident. On 22 June, they returned by train to their barracks. Clemenceau announced the end of the mutiny and gained a parliamentary vote of confidence by 327 votes to 223.

On 23 June, a law was finally passed, which repressed the massive chaptalisation of the wines.

Negotiations and the scale of the movement prevented collective punishment: the mutineers of the 17th were assigned to Gafsa (Tunisia), a place where soldiers were often sent for &quot;disciplinary companies&quot;, but these soldiers remained outside this framework, and were under ordinary military status. There was therefore no penal sanction for the revolt of the 17th, contrary to the legend that developed on this subject. However, during the First World War, haunted by their reputation as deserters, many of them were sent to the front line, particularly in the bloody assaults of 1914.

The mutiny of soldiers of the 17th has remained in historical memory, especially with the words of Montéhus&#x27; anti-militarist song &quot;Gloire au 17&quot;, with the refrain: &quot;Salute, salute to you / Brave soldiers of the seventeenth...&quot;

=== 20th century ===

<text>Forfar (; , ) is the county town of Angus, Scotland, and the administrative centre for Angus Council, with a new multi-million-pound office complex located on the outskirts of the town. As of 2021, the town has a population of 16,280.

The town lies in Strathmore and is situated just off the main A90 road between Perth and Aberdeen, with Dundee (the nearest city) being 13 miles (21 km) away. It is approximately 5 miles (8 km) from Glamis Castle, seat of the Bowes-Lyon family and ancestral home of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, and where the late Princess Margaret, younger sister of Queen Elizabeth II, was born in 1930.

Forfar dates back to the temporary Roman occupation of the area, and was subsequently held by the Picts and the Kingdom of Scotland. During the Scottish Wars of Independence, Forfar was occupied by English forces before being recaptured by the Scots and presented to Robert the Bruce. Forfar has been both a traditional market town and a major manufacturing centre for linen and jute. Today the main activities are agriculture and tourism around scenic Strathmore. The local glens are visited by hill-walkers, and there are ski-slopes in the mountains. The town is home to a number of local sporting teams, including the League Two football club, Forfar Athletic.

The Forfar bridie, a Scottish meat pastry snack, is traditionally identified with the town.

== Etymology ==
The exact origin of the name &quot;Forfar&quot; is uncertain. One suggestion is that the name is Gaelic and means &quot;a cold point&quot;, involving, &quot;fuar&quot; meaning &quot;cold, chilly&quot;, and &quot;bhar&quot; meaning &quot;a point&quot;.

==History==
During one of the Roman invasions of modern-day Scotland, the Romans established a major camp at Battledykes, approximately 3 miles (5 km) north of Forfar; this camp was analysed to have held 50,000 to 60,000 men. From Battledykes northward the Romans established a succession of camps including Stracathro, Raedykes and Normandykes.

During the Middle Ages, a &quot;claimant&quot; to the throne, the daughter of the leader of the Meic Uilleim, who were descendants of King Duncan II, had her brains dashed out on Forfar market cross in 1230 while still an infant.

During the First War of Scottish Independence, the castle of Forfar was held by the English. After Robert the Bruce&#x27;s victory over the Earl of Buchan, Philip, the Forester of Platane, together with some of his friends, raised ladders against the wall and, climbing over, surprised the garrison and killed them. He then yielded the castle to Bruce, who rewarded him and gave instructions for its slighting.

Like other parts of Angus, Forfar was home to a very successful textile industry during and after the Industrial Revolution. In the late 18th century the firm of William Don &amp; Co. (later William and John Don &amp; Co) was founded in the town. The firm originally bought and sold webs of linen which were woven in local cottages, although it also operated a small weaving shed. In 1865 the firm merged with A J Buist, a Dundee based firm, and began construction of St James Works in Forfar. The partnership also operated mills in Dundee and later built Station Works in Forfar, which contained some 300 looms. Workers&#x27; housing was built by the firm in Forfar. Don Brothers, Buist &amp; Company Ltd, as the firm was known from 1904, built another works in Forfar, at Strang Street, in 1929. In 1960 it merged with another Dundee firm, Low Brothers &amp; Co (Dundee) Ltd, eventually becoming Don &amp; Low (Holdings) Ltd. By the 1980s the Don &amp; Low group was the United Kingdom&#x27;s biggest polypropylene textile extrusion and weaving unit. The firm retains premises in Forfar, mainly producing woven and non-woven polypropylene industrial textile products and plastic food packaging. In 1958 Don Brothers, Buist &amp; Co Ltd acquired a controlling interest in another Forfar based-textile firm, Moffat &amp; Son Ltd, who operated Haugh Works in South Street. Another important Forfar textile firm was J &amp; A Craik &amp; Company, Linen and Jute Manufacturers, which was based at the Manor Works. Craiks was started in 1863 when James Craik obtained land in Forfar to build the Manor Works and the company survived until 1981, the year in which it became part of the Low and Bonar group. Craiks owned Forfar Fabrics Ltd, incorporated in 1965, which amalgamated with Low &amp; Bonar Textiles Limited in 1981. The jute manufacturers, John Lowson, Jnr &amp; Co Ltd, also operated in Forfar, operating out of Victoria Works.
The Meffan Museum is in the heart of the town. It was built by a daughter of the Provost Meffan as a bequest in 1898. It is home of the Forfar story. It is also an art gallery and a meeting place for local speakers, summer clubs for children and groups. The story of Forfar takes you from the history of the little cobbler shops to the burning of the witch Helen Guthrie. There is also a good selection of Pictish stones found in and around Forfar and Kirriemuir. The Large Class I Pictish stone, with a rare carving of a flower, is called the Dunnichen Stone. It was found in the early 19th century when a farmer from the East Mains of Dunnichen was ploughing. It was initially displayed at a church in the vicinity, then at Dunnichen House. In 1966 it was relocated at St Vigeans and finally moved to Dundee museum in 1972. After the Meffan Institute had been renovated it was brought to Forfar on a long-term loan where it is displayed alongside the Kirriemuir Sculptured Stones. There is a canoe, excavated from Forfar Loch, that dates back to the 11th century (one of two that were found).

In 1911 more than 20% of workers in Forfar were employed in the jute industry. Employment levels in this industry generally dramatically declined in other parts of Angus, including Dundee, during the next four decades. Notably in Dundee, the centre of the British jute industry, more than 40.4% of the working population had worked in the jute industry in 1911, but by 1951 this had fallen to just 18.5%. In Forfar, however this trend was not followed as percentage of the workforce employed in the jute industry had actually risen to 24.4% by 1951.

In the town there is a metal plaque to General Sikorski and the Polish troops commemorating the visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth to the town on 7 March 1941. The metal plaque is located on a wall on Market Street below Forfar Sheriff Court. It was here on 7 March 1941 that the Royal couple, along with General Sikorski, took the salute in the march past of the Polish troops.

Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the town and surrounding area in 2004 (the first time in around 30 years) and again in 2011. HRH Prince Charles, the Duke of Rothesay, visited the town in April 2012 to take the salute of the Black Watch during the regiment&#x27;s homecoming parade, marking its return from a six-month tour of duty in Afghanistan.

==Governance==

Forfar is a parish, town and former royal burgh. The meeting place of the burgh was the Forfar Town and County Hall. It is the county town of Angus, which was officially known as Forfarshire from the 18th century until 1928. The town is represented within Angus Council by the Forfar &amp; District ward, from which four councillors are elected. The members elected from this ward are, as of 2021; Lynne Devine (Scottish National Party), Braden Davy (Scottish Conservative and Unionist), Colin Brown (Independent) and Ian McLaren (Independent).

*Whitehills Primary School on Service Road. Whitehills contains a Gaelic Medium Unit where pupils are educated exclusively through the medium of Scottish Gaelic. The head teachers are Coureen Peters &amp; Elaine Gallon (acting).
*Strathmore Primary School on St James&#x27; Road. The head teacher is Jennifer Garnes.
*Langlands Primary School on Glamis Road. The school reopened in May 2009 after the original buildings were demolished and an extensive period of rebuilding and landscaping. The head teacher is Jayne McLean.

There is one secondary school in the town:
*Forfar Academy on Taylor Street, one of the largest schools in Angus with a roll of around 1,200 pupils.

In 2007, the Forfar-Carnoustie Schools Project made major changes to schools in Forfar, with closure of the following primary schools:

Chapelpark Primary School on Academy Street (the former Forfar Academy) opened in 1967 and was active for 40 years before closing in 2007. The pupils were re-located to Strathmore Primary and Whitehills Primary. The building continued in use as a school, initially by Whitehills Primary until their new school was completed in early 2008. It was then home to Langlands Primary, until the new school on that site was completed in May 2009. Some locals believe it would have made a great library/museum, but in spring of 2016 it was decided that it would be turned into an apartment block, it was completed in the summer of 2018.

Kirkriggs Primary School in St. James&#x27; Road was closed in 2007. Pupils were re-located to Langlands until the new school on this site (Strathmore Primary) was completed in early 2008.

Wellbrae Primary School closed in 2007. Pupils were sent to Chapelpark Primary School and later to Whitehills Primary School. The play areas of Wellbrae were all concrete. In 2016, it burned to the ground in an arson attack.

==Healthcare==
The local community hospital, the Whitehills Health and Community Care Centre, was built on the site of the old Whitehills Hospital building (the former hospital for infectious diseases) and opened in Spring 2005. The new hospital replaced Forfar Infirmary, formerly the town&#x27;s main hospital, as well as Whitehills Hospital. The Infirmary has since been completely demolished.

The Fyfe-Jamieson maternity hospital closed some time ago; it was across the road from the Forfar Academy, but the site has since been built over with houses.

==Places of worship==

Forfar has three Church of Scotland congregations:
*East and Old Church, originally the parish kirk, with a tall slender spire, with steeple clock overlooking the town centre. It is a category B listed building and was refurbished in early 2017. The church is situated in the town centre and offers a mixture of traditional and contemporary worship.
*Lowson Memorial Church, off Montrose Road. This is a category A listed church in late Scots Gothic style built in 1914 by A Marshall Mackenzie, who also designed Crathie Kirk. The church contains notable stained glass windows by Douglas Strachan. The church serves the east side of Forfar, and provides a mix of traditional and contemporary styles of worship.
*St Margaret&#x27;s Church, in the West High Street, originally a Free Kirk.

It had been decided (by a Church of Scotland arbiter) that the East and Old Parish Church would close, and the congregation would be moving to St. Margaret&#x27;s Church. This was brought back for discussion at Angus Presbytery due to a large vote against this decision. Now the East and Old and St Margaret&#x27;s are to remain individual churches as they have always have been.

The East &amp; Old Church is built on the site of the original place of worship that some of the monks of Restenneth Priory built hundreds of years before the one today. The adjoining graveyard has famous &#x27;residents&#x27; such as botanist George Don, quite a few scholars and a man who blamed the witches of Forfar for poisoning him after ill words were exchanged between them.

The steeple is a focal point of Forfar, visible when entering the town from any direction. Although abutting the East &amp; Old building, it is owned by the &#x27;Town&#x27; and is not formally part of the church property; it is all but certain to be retained following any disposal of the church building.

The town has churches of other denominations, including:
* St John the Evangelist Scottish Episcopal Church, East High Street, designed by Sir R Rowand Anderson and consecrated in 1881. Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, later to become Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, was confirmed in this church.
*St Fergus Roman Catholic Church.
* Forfar Community Church at Wellbraehead on part of the old school site.

There is a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah&#x27;s witnesses

== Other items of interest ==

The town is traditionally identified with the Forfar Bridie, a meat pastry snack. A recipe for the Forfar bridie was featured in &quot;Maw Broon&#x27;s Cookbook&quot;.

Another feature of the town is the Forfar Loch Country Park, which is visited by locals as a walking venue. It is said that the Forfar Loch extended over much more of Forfar in the 1800s, going as far up as Orchardbank and Wellbrae. A drainage project brought the water level down. In about the same time period the loch was used to dump raw sewage; thankfully this practice is no longer continued: it is now treated sewage.

The town holds many events throughout the year such as the bi-annual Forfar Mara-Fun, which raises money for charity, and the annual Forfar Food Festival highlighting some of the local food. There is also a monthly farmers&#x27; market.

Forfar is home to the Strathmore Mineral Water Co., Ltd., a bottled mineral water producer now run by AG Barr. The company&#x27;s products are shipped worldwide.

Forfar is known for the &quot;coo o Forfar&quot;. A householder left a tub of beer in the doorway to cool, and a passing cow drank it. When the owner of the cow was charged for the beer, a baillie ruled that if the beer was drunk at the doorway it was &quot;deoch an doras&quot; or &quot;stirrup cup&quot;, to charge for which would be an insult to Scots hospitality. This became a byword: &quot;Be like the coo o Forfar, an tak a stannin drink&quot;.

==Public services==
Forfar and the surrounding area is supplied with water by Scottish Water from Lintrathen and Backwater reservoirs in Glen Isla. Electricity distribution is by Scottish Hydro Electric plc, part of the Scottish and Southern Energy group.

Waste management is handled by Angus Council. From June 2014, there has been a comprehensive recycling service in place, succeeding the more limited kerbside recycling scheme introduced in 2005. Recyclable waste (encompassing paper, card, cans, plastics and glass) is now collected fortnightly, on alternate weeks with non-recyclable waste, with households having separate bins for each purpose. (Garden and food waste are also collected for separate processing.) Roughly two-thirds of non-recyclable material is sent to landfill at Angus Council&#x27;s site at Lochhead, Forfar and the remainder sent for incineration (with energy recovery) outside the council area.

A recycling centre is located at Queenswell Road. Items accepted include, steel and aluminium cans, cardboard, paper, electrical equipment, engine oil, fridges and freezers, garden waste, gas bottles, glass, liquid food and drinks cartons, plastic bottles, plastic carrier bags, rubble, scrap metal, shoes and handbags, spectacles, textiles, tin foil, wood and yellow pages. Angus council publishes details of where and how each product is processed. There are also glass banks at the Abbeygate and Tesco car parks. The Angus Council area had a recycling rate of 34.7% in 2007/08.

Healthcare is supplied in the area by NHS Tayside. The nearest hospitals with accident and emergency departments are Arbroath Infirmary and Ninewells Hospital, Dundee. Primary Health Care in Forfar is supplied by several practices, based at Ravenswood Surgery on New Road, Academy Medical Centre in Academy Street and Lour Road Group Practice. Forfar, along with the rest of Scotland is served by the Scottish Ambulance Service.

As from April 2013, law enforcement is provided by Police Scotland and Forfar is served by Scottish Fire and Rescue Service.

<doc id="262963" wikidata="Q1509803" url="?curid=262963" title="Gerald Boland">
<text>Gerald Boland (25 May 1885 – 5 January 1973) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Minister for Justice from 1939 to 1948 and 1951 to 1954, Minister for Lands from 1936 to 1939, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs from 1933 to 1936 and Government Chief Whip from 1932 to 1933. He served as a Senator from 1961 to 1969 and a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Roscommon constituency from 1923 to 1961.

Boland was active during the Irish revolutionary period, fighting in both the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War, the latter of which saw the death of his brother Harry Boland. Following the wars, Boland was amongst those who led Republicans out of Sinn Féin and into Fianna Fáil following a split over abstentionism. When Fianna Fáil came to power in 1932, Boland became a perennial member of the cabinet, most notably as Ireland&#x27;s longest-serving Minister for Justice. Despite being socially liberal in his views and a committed Irish republican, as Minister for Justice he was frequently asked by the government to enforce hardline policies against Irish citizens to prevent the Irish Republican Army from drawing the Irish state into World War II.

==Early life==
Born in Manchester, Gerald Boland was the son of James Boland and Kate Boland (&quot;née&quot; Woods). He was the second child and eldest son among three sons (including Harry Boland) and two daughters of the couple. His family on both sides were staunch Irish Nationalists; his father had been a Fenian in his younger days, a devout follower of Charles Stewart Parnell, and later a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB). His father also had ties to the Irish National Invincibles, and his association with them caused him to have to flee to New York City for a time.

After his national school education Boland attended the O&#x27;Brien Institute in Fairview, Dublin. He left school at fifteen and became an apprentice fitter at Broadstone Station. Instead of attending his studies to secure an engineering diploma, Boland took Irish language and history classes at night. Despite this, he passed his engineering exams.

==Revolutionary years==

Boland was enrolled in the IRB along with his younger brothers Harry in 1904, following in the footsteps of his father James, uncle Jack. Gerald and his brothers Harry and Ned subsequently joined the Irish Volunteers when that organisation was established in 1913, serving in the same company as Arthur Griffith. When news broke out of the Easter Rising in 1916 Boland immediately left his job in Crooksling, however, he was bitterly disappointed when he found out that the order was countermanded. When the rebellion began in earnest on Easter Monday, he made his way to Jacob&#x27;s Mill where he fought under Thomas MacDonagh. Following the official surrender, Boland was arrested and interned at Frongoch internment camp in Wales, where he came into contact with other notable revolutionary leaders, including his brother Harry&#x27;s friend Michael Collins.

Boland was released after a general amnesty in December 1916, however, he remained involved in revolutionary circles, although he declined to rejoin the IRB, believing the organisation was no longer needed. He was arrested and imprisoned in Belfast from May to December 1918 for practising military drills in the Dublin Mountains. Meanwhile, a number of his colleagues secured their release by winning seats in the 1918 general election.

During the War of Independence, Boland was Battalion Commandant of 7 Battalion, Dublin Brigade, IRA and was known as &#x27;Trotsky&#x27; for his left-wing views.

He and his brothers were opposed to the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921. Boland was Battalion Commandant of 3 Battalion, 2 Dublin Brigade (South Dublin) in Blessington, County Wicklow, but was captured early on in Irish Civil War on 7 July 1922 and was interned until release in July 1924. On the outside, his brother Harry died some days after being shot, in August 1922, after two National Army officers attempted to arrest him at the Grand Hotel in Skerries, Dublin. Boland applied to the Irish government for a service pension under the Military Service Pensions Act, of 1934 and was awarded 11 and 5/12 years of service at Grade C for his service with the Irish Volunteers and the IRA between 1 April 1916 and 30 September 1923.

==Political career==
===Beginnings===
Following the end of the Civil War, Boland helped to build up Sinn Féin as the main Republican party. While still imprisoned, he was selected to stand for Dáil Éireann as the TD for Roscommon, Harry&#x27;s old seat, for the 1923 general election, in which he was successful. Boland was amongst those in Kilmainham Gaol who went on hunger strike in October 1923. The hunger strike did not result in his release and Boland credits his practice of Yoga with keeping him alive at that time.

Boland was eventually released from the custody of the state in July 1924. Upon his release, Boland became secretary of Sinn Féin and stood on the executive of the party.

===Sinn Féin to Fianna Fáil===
Boland was amongst the first in Sinn Féin to call for an end to the party&#x27;s abstentionism from Dáil Éireann, believing it to be a political dead end. Party leader Éamon de Valera proposed that the party abandon this policy and take their seats in the Dáil if changes were made to the oath of allegiance to the British monarch. His proposal was defeated and de Valera and his supporters, including Boland, left Sinn Féin. Shortly after this split, a new party emerged called Fianna Fáil, with de Valera acting as leader and the other disillusioned Republican TDs joining. Boland was vital in transferring many members from Sinn Féin to Fianna Fáil. Fianna Fáil briefly also had an abstentionist policy but in 1927 a new law forced Fianna Fáil TDs to take the oath of allegiance and take their seats in the Dáil. Fianna Fáil dismissed the Oath as &quot;an empty formula&quot;.

Boland worked alongside Seán Lemass in building up Fianna Fáil&#x27;s grassroots support and organisation, with Boland giving particular attention to the party&#x27;s rural apparatus. In the September 1927 general election Fianna Fáil came within four seats of the ruling Cumann na nGaedheal party. The latter formed a coalition of sorts with the Farmers&#x27; Party and returned to government.

===In cabinet===

Following the 1932 general election, Fianna Fáil formed a new government. Boland was appointed Government Chief Whip, a position which allowed him to attend cabinet meetings but not vote at them.

Fianna Fáil remained in power with an increased mandate following the 1933 general election and Boland was promoted to the position of Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. Despite being the Minister in charge of the postal service, Boland did not own a telephone until some time later. During his tenure, the postal service made considerable progress. It was also during this time that the Post Office became a paying concern. During his time as minister, Boland oversaw a major expansion of the telephone service in Ireland, improvements in the transmission capacity of Radio Éireann, and construction of new provincial post offices and a new central postal sorting office.

Boland was acting minister of Justice briefly for a time when P. J. Ruttledge was ill. It was during this time that Boland declared the Irish Republican Army a proscribed organisation.

A cabinet reshuffle in 1936 saw Boland become Minister for Lands, before later taking on responsibility for Fisheries. As Minister for Lands Boland introduced a land act in 1939 which reformed land distribution. The act broadened the criteria by which the state could take control over undeveloped land while offering the tenant of the land more favourable terms of compensation. Boland was critical of Lemass&#x27; policy of centralising industrial development in Dublin, he instead wished to see a more decentralised economy based around food production. The differing viewpoint caused a rift between Boland and Lemass, but despite this Boland favoured Lemass&#x27;s policy of state intervention in the economy over Seán MacEntee&#x27;s more Laissez-faire approach.

In 1937 Boland was highly vocal during the drafting of a new constitution of Ireland by Fianna Fáil against any word which would have given the Catholic Church special status, something heavily considered at the time. Boland declared that if the constitution elevated the position of the Catholic Church above others, it would be sectarian, anti-republican, and a hindrance to any prospects of Irish reunification. As a compromise, the term ‘special relationship’ was used in the final version of the draft.

===Minister for Justice===
The outbreak of World War II in 1939, known as the Emergency in Ireland, resulted in several new cabinet appointments and Boland became Minister for Justice. He took over at a time when the IRA had once again declared war against the British state and had begun their Sabotage Campaign. Boland was charged with the task of crushing the organisation and preventing the IRA from drawing the Irish state into conflict with the UK. Although Boland always considered himself a Republican, he took a hardline against the IRA and used his powers to order the internment of hundreds of IRA members before introducing military courts and special criminal courts.

In 1940, several imprisoned IRA members went on hunger strike, Boland, however, refused to grant their release. Two of the men eventually died, one of whom was the nephew of one of Boland&#x27;s Fianna Fáil colleagues. Tony D&#x27;Arcy died as a result of a 52-day Hunger-strike (16 April 1940) at the age of 32 and Jack McNeela died three days later (19 April 1940) after 55 days on hunger strike. These deaths sparked reprisals by the IRA on the Garda Síochána. Boland subsequently introduced tougher measures by setting up a military court with the death penalty with no provision for appeal except for a review by the government. In all, twelve men were found guilty with six of them facing death and the remaining six having their sentences changed to imprisonment. Amongst those executed was Charlie Kerins, an acting Chief of Staff of the IRA.

As Minister of Justice, Boland was also asked to enforce policies of wartime censorship, however, finding the idea of the state censorship distasteful he established a censorship board to avoid accusations of bias.

During the Emergency, Boland was also responsible for the detention of several foreign agents in pursuit of Ireland&#x27;s strict policy of neutrality. During this time some 500 individuals were interned and 600 were sentenced under the newly introduced Offences against the State Act, 1939. By 1943 the IRA were in disarray, particularly after the Chief of Staff was arrested and imprisoned, leaving the organisation without leadership. Boland and Fianna Fáil felt their hardline was backed by the electorate following strong returns for the party at the 1944 general election.

In 1947, Boland was amongst four leading Fianna Fáil figures (including de Valera) involved in the &quot;Locke&#x27;s Distillery Scandal&quot;, an accusation brought by Oliver J. Flanagan that foreign businessmen were bribing members of Fianna Fáil to gain the right to purchase the distillery. A tribunal of inquiry found no evidence to support the claims, but event tainted the public&#x27;s view of Fianna Fáil.

====Second term as Minister of Justice====
By 1948, Fianna Fáil had been in government for an uninterrupted 16 years. With World War II finally over, the electorate sought change and a fresh start. Arising to meet this desire was the new political party Clann na Poblachta. Led by Seán MacBride, this new party sought to kick off a new post-war political era in Ireland, and to do this meant removing Fianna Fáil from power. Many in Clann na Poblachta had Republican backgrounds and in some ways, the party could be partially described as an organic reaction to Fianna Fáil and Boland&#x27;s hardline stance during the war years. Many in political circles, including inside Fianna Fáil, thought Clann na Poblachta could be a new force to reckon with.

However, de Valera always held a reputation for being cunning in selecting the dates of general elections, and he once again cemented that notion, when he called for a general election in early 1948 before Clann na Poblachta, was completely ready to contest a national election. At the 1948 general election Clann na Poblachta and other Fianna Fáil opponents did well, but not as well as expected. To remove Fianna Fáil from government, every single party in the Dáil and several independents had to form the unwieldy &quot;First Inter-Party Government&quot;. The coalition saw Clann na Poblachta forced to work with Fine Gael, considered the traditional &quot;enemy&quot; of Irish Republicanism. By 1951 the coalition collapsed and Fianna Fáil returned to government following that year&#x27;s election, with Boland re-appointed Minister for Justice.

===Later years===
Boland did not seek ministerial office in 1957 when Fianna Fáil returned to power after its defeat in 1954. However, his son, Kevin, was appointed to the cabinet as Minister for Defence at the beginning of his first term in the Dáil. By this stage, Boland was beginning to be seen as an ageing warhorse, with his base in Roscommon starting to slip and Fianna Fáil unhappy that Boland was unable to get a Fianna Fáil running mate elected alongside himself.

At the 1961 general election, Boland was defeated for the first time in fourteen general election campaigns. Despite losing his Dáil seat, he subsequently secured election to Seanad Éireann. Four years later in 1965, he returned to the Seanad, this time as a nominee by the Taoiseach Seán Lemass.

In 1970, the outbreak of the Arms Crisis saw Kevin Boland resign as a Minister and as Secretary of Fianna Fáil in protest at the government&#x27;s policy on Northern Ireland and in response to the sackings of Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney from the cabinet over allegations they had arranged for weapons to be provided to the Provisional IRA. Gerald Boland, in a similar protest, resigned as a vice president and as a trustee of Fianna Fáil, although he remained a member of the party. He also articulated his loss of confidence in the leadership of Taoiseach Jack Lynch.

==Death==

Gerald Boland died in Dublin at the age of 87 on 5 January 1973. His wife, Annie Boland, predeceased him in 1970. He was survived by his three daughters and four sons.

<doc id="262964" wikidata="Q1740089" url="?curid=262964" title="Kevin Boland">
<text>Kevin Boland (15 October 1917 – 23 September 2001) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Leader of Aontacht Éireann from 1971 to 1976, Minister for Social Welfare from 1961 to 1966 and 1969 to 1970, Minister for Local Government from 1966 to 1970 and Minister for Defence from 1957 to 1961. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1957 to 1970. 

He is one of eight TDs appointed as a Minister at the beginning of their first term in the Dáil.

==Early life and career==
Boland was born in Dublin in 1917. He attended St. Joseph&#x27;s C.B.S. in Fairview, leaving in 1933. He was the son of Gerald Boland, a founder-member of Fianna Fáil, and the nephew of Harry Boland. Despite this, the young Boland failed to get elected to Dáil Éireann on his first two attempts, standing in the Dublin County constituency at the 1951 general election and again at the 1954 general election. Double success followed at the 1957 general election, when he was not only elected to the 16th Dáil but was appointed to the cabinet as Minister for Defence on his very first day in the Dáil. This was due to the retirement of his father who had served in every Fianna Fáil government since 1932.

The Defence portfolio was largely considered a safe and uncontroversial position, so Boland made only a small impact. As a Minister, he displayed a fáinne (gold ring) on the lapel of his jacket, which indicated that he was able and willing to speak the Irish language. He frequently conducted his governmental business in Irish, which he was very good at; he had won awards for it in school. In 1961, he was moved from Defence to become the Minister for Social Welfare. He remained there until the retirement in 1966 of the Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, when Fianna Fáil faced the first leadership contest in its history. He was then appointed Minister for Local Government which post he held until he left government in 1970.

The leadership race immediately erupted as a two-horse battle between Charles Haughey and George Colley. Both of these men epitomised the new kind of professional politician of the 1960s. Things changed when Neil Blaney indicated his interest in running. Boland supported him in his campaign, as both men hailed from the republican and left wing of the party. There was talk at one point of Boland himself entering the leadership race. In the end Jack Lynch was chosen as a compromise, and he became the new Taoiseach. Boland was appointed as Minister for Local Government in the new government.

==Arms Crisis==

In 1969, events in Northern Ireland caused political chaos over the border in Ireland. It was the start of The Troubles in Northern Ireland and Fianna Fáil&#x27;s policy with regard to the North was coming into question. One crisis meeting was held after another, in which the possibility of decisive action was discussed. The &quot;hawks&quot; in the cabinet urged a symbolic invasion of Northern Ireland to protect nationalists near the border, and to draw international attention, while the &quot;doves&quot;, who ultimately prevailed, urged caution. These cabinet meetings were heated events. On one occasion Boland was alleged to have been so angry that he resigned not only his cabinet position but also his Dáil seat and went home to his farm in County Dublin to make hay. The resignations were rejected by the Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, after a calming-down period. In what became known as the Arms Crisis two ministers, Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney, were sacked from the government in May 1970, for allegedly being involved in a plot to import arms for Republicans in the North. Boland resigned in solidarity with them and in protest about the government&#x27;s position on the North. Later that year his criticism of the Taoiseach (whom Boland and many others within the Party maintained had authorized the arms importation) led to his expulsion from the Fianna Fáil party. Boland resigned as a TD on 4 November 1970.

One of Boland&#x27;s most famous incidents took place at the Fianna Fáil Ardfheis in 1971. Just before Jack Lynch&#x27;s speech Boland stormed a nearby podium, interrupting Patrick Hillery in the middle of his speech. Boland openly defied the party leadership and his opponents, holding his arms wide open and shouting to the crowd, &quot;Come on up and put me down.&quot; While there was a lot of booing and clapping in an effort to drown him out, many of his supporters started cheering and chanting &quot;We want Boland.&quot; An enraged Patrick Hillery grabbed his microphone and famously replied, &quot;If you want a fight you can have it … You can have Boland, but you can&#x27;t have Fianna Fáil.&quot; At this point the government supporters went ecstatic with cheering and Boland was carried out of the hall.

==Political decline and retirement==
Boland founded his own political party, Aontacht Éireann (Irish Unity) in 1971. It won very little support and Boland himself failed to be elected to the Dáil in 1973, which effectively ended his political career. Boland and his colleagues resigned from the party in 1976 after it was taken over by a number of far-right individuals. He remained an outspoken critic of the Republic&#x27;s Northern Ireland policy, particularly the Sunningdale Agreement. He made one last attempt to reclaim a Dáil seat, standing unsuccessfully in the Dublin South-West constituency at the 1981 general election. He then retired from public life completely.

In 1996, he sued the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; for libel after a 28 January 1993 article incorrectly stated that he had appeared before the court in the Arms Trial in 1970 and had been dismissed as a Minister by Taoiseach Jack Lynch. He was awarded £75,000 in damages.

Kevin Boland died in Dublin on 23 September 2001.

Boland wrote a series of political books, including his self-published autobiography, &quot;Up Dev!&quot;:

<doc id="262966" wikidata="Q908658" url="?curid=262966" title="Brendan Corish">
<text>Brendan Corish (19 November 1918 – 17 February 1990) was an Irish Labour Party politician who served as Tánaiste and Minister for Health from 1973 to 1977, Leader of the Labour Party, Minister for Social Welfare from 1954 to 1957 and from 1973 to 1977, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government from 1948 to 1951. He was a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1945 to 1982.

==Early and personal life==
He was born at William Street in Wexford town. His father, Richard Corish, a well-known trade union official and Sinn Féin member, had been elected to the Second Dáil shortly after the birth of his son and later joined the Labour Party, serving as a local and national politician until his death in 1945. His mother was Catherine Bergin.

He was educated locally at Wexford CBS and, in his youth, was a member of the 2nd Wexford Scout troop (Scouting Ireland). At the age of nineteen, he joined the clerical staff of Wexford County Council.

He was married to Phyllis, and they had three sons.

He spent several years playing Gaelic football for the Wexford county team.

==Political career==
Corish was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Labour Party candidate in the Wexford by-election in 1945, necessitated by the death of his father who was the sitting TD. He took a seat on the fractured opposition benches, as Fianna Fáil&#x27;s grip on power continued.

He retained his seat at the 1948 general election in which Fianna Fáil was returned as the largest party in the Dáil once again. However, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the National Labour Party, Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talmhan and a number of Independent candidates all came together to form the first inter-party government. Corish was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Defence and Local Government.

When the second inter-party government was formed after the 1954 general election, Corish was appointed Minister for Social Welfare.

In 1960 Corish succeeded William Norton as Labour Party leader. He introduced new policies which made the party more socialist in outlook and described the party program as Christian socialist. Corish considered that the party principles were those endorsed by Pope John XXIII and greatly admired the Pope who he said was &quot;one of the greatest contributors of all changes in Irish attitudes&quot;. However, the party moved carefully because &#x27;socialism&#x27; was still considered a dirty word in 1960s Ireland. Corish claimed that Ireland would be &#x27;Socialist in the Seventies&#x27;. To a certain extent he was right because Fine Gael and the Labour Party formed a coalition government between 1973 and 1977. Corish became Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Social Welfare. A wide range of social security benefits were introduced during Corish&#x27;s time as a government minister, including a Deserted Wife&#x27;s Benefit and Unmarried Mother&#x27;s Allowance, Prisoner&#x27;s Wife&#x27;s Allowance, Single Woman&#x27;s Allowance, and the Supplementary Welfare Allowance, providing supplementary income to individuals and families with low incomes. In 1974, compulsory social insurance was extended to virtually all employees, and that same year short-term social insurance benefits (occupational injury, maternity, unemployment and sickness benefits) became partially index-linked. According to one study, this signalled “an extension in the function of the income maintenance system from basic income support to proportional replacement of market earnings for some groups.” The replacement of the existing flat-rate unemployment benefit with an earnings-related benefit meant that the average unemployment replacement rate went up from about 30% to 60%.

Corish was deeply religious, telling the Dáil in 1953 that &quot;I am an Irishman second, I am a catholic first...if the hierarchy give me any direction with regard to catholic social teaching or catholic moral teaching, I accept without qualification in all respects the teaching of the hierarchy and the church to which I belong&quot;.

In 1977, the Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave called a general election, and Fianna Fáil was returned to power in a landslide victory. Corish resigned as leader of the Labour Party, having signalled his intent to do so before the election. He was succeeded as party leader by Frank Cluskey. Corish retired from politics completely at the February 1982 general election.

<text>Constant Anton Nieuwenhuys (21 July 1920 – 1 August 2005), better known as Constant, was a Dutch painter, sculptor, graphic artist, author and musician.

==Early period==
Constant was born in Amsterdam on 21 July 1920 as the first son of Pieter Nieuwenhuijs and Maria Cornelissen. Their second son, Jan Nieuwenhuys, was born a year later. Both sons became artists although their parents had no apparent interest in art.

As a young child Constant drew passionately and showed great talent. He read literature with a special preference for poetry and played musical instruments. During his teenage years he learned to sing and to read music while in the church choir at the Ignatius Gymnasium, a prestigious Jesuit school in Amsterdam. In his later years, greatly inspired by gypsy music, he only played improvised music. He played guitar, violin and at 45 years of age also mastered playing the cimbalon.

Constant painted his first oil painting, &quot;De Emmaüsgangers&quot;, at age sixteen. It depicted the revelation of Jesus to two of his followers in Emmaus. With no money to buy materials he painted this painting on a jute sugar bag with pigments he had bought from a house painter. Many of Constant&#x27;s early drawings and paintings are religiously inspired, due to his Jesuit schooling. Yet at the age of twenty Constant turned his back on Catholicism.

After one year studying at the Kunstnijverheidsschool (Arts and Crafts School), Constant attended the Rijksakademie voor Beeldende Kunst (State Academy of Fine Arts) from 1939 to 1941. This education in craftmanship was put to use especially during his &quot;New Babylon&quot; period, when Constant built many constructions and models.

Constant lived and worked in Bergen from 1941 to 1943. Through the Bergense School he was introduced to the work of Paul Cézanne, which impacted him deeply, as evident in &quot;Zelfportret&quot; (Self Portrait), 1942. On 13 July 1942 he married Matie van Domselaer, the daughter of the composer Jakob van Domselaer.

The city of Bergen was evacuated by the Germans in 1943 and so Constant and Matie moved back to Amsterdam. During this period Constant went into hiding and refrained from registering at the Kulturkammer (Nazi Chamber of Culture) to avoid the Arbeitseinsatz (labour supply for the Germans). Because of this he was unable to conventionally exercise his craft or to buy art supplies. To paint Constant used tablecloths and bed linen and had to rinse them out to start again.

During the war Constant&#x27;s brother in law, Jaap van Domselaer, moved into the apartment to hide from the &#x27;Arbeitseinsatz.&#x27; He introduced Constant to Plato, Spinoza, Descartes, Kant, Hegel and Marx. Especially the latter provided great inspiration to Constant regarding his later ideas on art and society.

During the winter famine of 1944 Constant&#x27;s first son, Victor Nieuwenhuys, was born. After the war, Constant, his wife and son moved back to Bergen only to return to Amsterdam in 1946 where they lived in an apartment across from the zoo Artis. When the war ended Constant was able to expand and grow as an artist after years of captivity and limitations. He liberated himself artistically and experimented with multiple techniques of art-making. He was inspired by Cubism, especially by Georges Braque. In 1946 his daughter Martha was born, followed by his daughter Olga in 1948.

==CoBrA==
In 1946 Constant travelled to Paris for the first time where he met the young Danish painter Asger Jorn. The friendship between Jorn and Constant later formed the basis for the avant-garde movement CoBrA.

July 1948 Constant founded Reflex &quot;&quot; with Corneille, Karel Appel and his brother Jan Nieuwenhuys. The first edition of the magazine &quot;Reflex&quot; was published with a manifesto written by Constant. For Constant art had to be experimental. He had deducted this from the French word &#x27;expérience&#x27; and believed that art springs from experience of the artist and is continuously changing. In the manifesto he stated that the process of creation is more important to the experimental artist than the work itself; it is a means to reach spiritual and mental enrichment. Also, the work of experimental artists is a mirror image of changes in the general perception of beauty.

Constant, Corneille and Appel, three totally different characters and artists, were united in their quest for innovation. They exhibited their work together and were often seen together in the European art scene. The wanderlust of the three is especially notorious.

Later in the year 1948 on the terrace of café Notre Dame in Paris the &quot;Experimentele Groep in Holland&quot; linked up with Christian Dotremont and Joseph Noiret from Belgium and Asger Jorn from Denmark to form CoBrA, a name which was made by Dotremont, formed by the first letters of their hometowns: Copenhagen, Brussels and Amsterdam. The members opposed aesthetics in painting and bourgeois art in general.

Constant had already outlined their ideas in his manifesto in &quot;Reflex&quot; magazine. This manifesto contains another of his famous quotes: &quot;A painting is not a structure of colours and lines, but an animal, a night, a cry, a man, or all of these together&quot;.

Constant was productive during the CoBrA period. &quot;White Bird&quot; (1948), &quot;Ladder&quot; (1949) and &quot;Scorched Earth I&quot; (1951) are some of his noted works from this period. At this time CoBrA published bulletin additional artists from several different disciplines joined their ranks. In 1948 Constant, together with poet Gerrit Kouwenaar, published a poetry album &quot;Goede Morgen Haan&quot;. Additionally there were two large CoBrA exhibitions, one in Amsterdam in 1949 and one in Liège in 1951.

The director of the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (Municipal Museum of Amsterdam), Willem Sandberg, was very supportive of young artists and fully supported the CoBrA group by giving them seven large rooms to exhibit their work in. Most of the CoBrA works had been fairly small due to their lack of money and so Sandberg gave the artists an advance to create some larger works in the week before the exhibition. Constant, Corneille, Appel and Eugène Brands created several large pieces of art that have become iconic for the movement. The architect Aldo van Eyck was commissioned to shape the exhibition. The works of art as well as the way they were presented give rise to harsh critique from press and public. A critic from Het Vrije Volk wrote: &quot;Geklad, geklets en geklodder in het Stedelijk Museum&quot; (&quot;Smirch, twaddle and mess in the Municipal Museum&quot;). The CoBrA artists were considered scribblers and con artists.

In the Liège exhibition in 1951, even larger than the Stedelijk exhibition, the CoBrA group dissolved itself and with its tenth edition bulletin publication. As Christian Dotremont, the international secretary, stated in Museum News in 1962 the group would rather &quot;mourir en beauté&quot; (die in beauty) than become a regular artist interest group.

==Situationist International==

After CoBrA Constant&#x27;s work became more abstract. Back in Amsterdam in the summer of 1952 he developed an interest in spatial architecture and three-dimensional works. With Aldo van Eyck, whom he met during his CoBrA time, he created a space for the exhibition &#x27;Man and House&#x27; at the Urban Museum Amsterdam from 1952-1953. In 1954 he worked on a project with Gerrit Rietveld. Together they created a model house for warehouses de Bijenkorf.

In 1952 Constant received a scholarship from the Arts Council of Great Britain to study in London for three months. There he met, amongst others, Henry Moore, Anthony Hill, Kenneth Martin, Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth, Roger Hilton and Victor Pasmore. He found the art climate in London very welcoming. As opposed to Paris, Constant felt that art was judged more objectively.

At that time Constant lived near Kensington Gardens and as he walked through the bombed city every day he started to wonder how people live and how cities should be built. His stay in London raised his awareness of how the constructions that surround us influence us. He felt that the constructions of his time were mostly practical, immensely dull and provided no room to develop playful and creative lifestyles.

In the summer of 1956 Asger Jorn invited Constant to Alba, Piedmont, Italy, for a congress dedicated to &#x27;Industry and the Fine Arts&#x27; initiated by &#x27;Mouvement pour un Bauhaus Imaginiste&#x27; (International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus). At this congress Constant presented his lecture &quot;Demain la poésie logera la vie&quot; in which he pleaded for a free architecture which could stimulate a creative lifestyle rather than impede it. In 1952 Debord had founded the Lettrist International for which he was a writer, filmmaker and strategic activist. The &#x27;Lettrist International&#x27; were also at the Alba congress and they pleaded for a unitary urbanism (the synthesis of art and technology). Later that year Constant visited Debord in Alba, which proved to be an inspiration for both.

Debord wanted to establish an even more radical movement which would totally abandon the arena of fine art while solely focusing on questions of psychogeography, a total dissolution of boundaries between art and life. In 1957 he and Asger Jorn brought together the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus and the Lettrist International by establishing Situationist International. They specifically denied their status as an art movement.

Constant did not join SI at that time. He objected to the SI on the ground that the movement seemed to be established mainly by artists who have their own interest at heart more than a common goal. When SI openly pleaded for &#x27;unitary urbanism&#x27;, as defined by Constant and Debord, Constant joined. An intensive correspondence between him and Debord followed. Constant wrote several theoretical articles for the French SI journal and staged events at several museums in Paris as well as the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, where he showed his &quot;New Babylon&quot; series in 1959.

The success of the &quot;New Babylon&quot; show in 1959 prompted SI to plan a group exhibition there in April–May 1960. This exhibition would never take place. Disagreements in the group resulted in a split and several expulsions. In 1960 Constant left the group for the same reason he initially objected to joining. By 1961 no one remained of the original artistic core or tendency except Debord himself. though members more allied to the SI&#x27;s political tendency remained.

==New Babylon==

Back in Amsterdam after his stay in London, Nieuwenhuys started to focus mainly on architecture and the urban environment. The focal point of his work was finding out what potential added value art can provide in intensifying daily life, in which there is room for creative expression. He abandoned painting to work solely on his New Babylon project from 1956 to 1974.

With New Babylon Nieuwenhuys envisioned a &quot;world wide city for the future&quot; where land is owned collectively, work is fully automated and the need to work replaced with a nomadic life of creative play. New Babylon is inhabited by &quot;homo ludens&quot;, who, freed from labor, will not have to make art, for he can be creative in the daily practice of his life.

In Nieuwenhuys&#x27; own words:
The project of New Babylon only intends to give the minimum conditions for a behaviour that must remain as free as possible. Any restriction of the freedom of movement, any limitation with regard to the creation of mood and atmosphere, has to be avoided. Everything has to remain possible, all is to happen, the environment has to be created by the activity of life, and not inversely.

The New Babylon project consisted of a series of models, constructions, maquettes, collages, drawings, graphics and texts expressing Constant&#x27;s theories of urban development and social interaction. A few examples of spatial constructions for which he used modern materials like stainless steel, aluminum and perspex are &quot;Het Ruimtecircus&quot; (1956) (Spatial Circus) and &quot;Het Zonneschip&quot; (1956) (Sunvessel).

In 1974 the New Babylon project officially came to an end with a large exhibition in the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag. Because he lacked room to store the vast collection of constructions, maquettes, maps and structures he sold them all to the museum. In 1999 &quot;Constant&#x27;s New Babylon: City for Another Life&quot;, opened at the Drawing Center in New York. It was his first solo exhibition in the United States and was curated by Mark Wigley. There was a symposium conducted in conjunction with the exhibition.

According to the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, Nieuwenhuys has made a lot of architects think with his New Babylon: &quot;He was an example of courage&quot;.
==Colorism==
Constant returned to painting, watercoloring and graphics in 1969. Until the mid-1970s, the subjects of his imaginary world New Babylon still crowded his work. However, more and more, he was inspired by contemporary and political issues, including such things as the Vietnam War, African famine and Kosovo refugees. Marxism was a strong influence. Rudi Fuchs said in his foreword to the Catalogue of Constant Paintings in 1995: &quot;there are people who consider Constant&#x27;s later work as a return to tradition. I, however, do not share this opinion. Because I consider his later development from the 1970s as greater penetration into the garden of painting.&quot;

In the tradition of the Venetian Renaissance painters, Titian and Tintoretto, Constant applied himself to the technique of colorism. Following this technique the artist doesn&#x27;t make use of charcoal or pencil sketches but applies colour directly on the canvas with the paintbrush, constructing soft transitions instead of sharp contours. The most important feature of this technique is the way light is expressed in the painting by integrating it into the colour. This technique is laborious. The painting comes to life layer by layer. Constant painted with oil on canvas and every layer he applied then needed to dry. In this period Constant produced a mere three to four paintings per year.

==Public space==
In 1949 Constant decorated a garden wall in Tibirkelunde, Sjelland, Denmark.

In 1963 &quot;The Gate of Constant&quot; was placed at the entry of a sports park in the west side of Amsterdam. Constant designed the forty-foot-high concrete structure as a commission for the Municipality of Amsterdam. For almost three decades the structure adorned the entry in anonymity until Rita Doets, a former employee of the municipality, left money in her legacy to construct an information sign next to the gate. Constant&#x27;s widow, Trudy Nieuwenhuijs, was present at the inauguration.

In 1966 Constant designed a fountain for the Kooiplein in Leiden. For years the structure didn&#x27;t function and slowly withered. When the square was redesigned in 1999, the fountain was repaired. New equipment made sure that the shoppers were not bothered by the water.

==Death==
Constant died on 1 August 2005 and was survived by his son and his three daughters, and by his widow and her daughter.

== Films ==
&quot;Gyromorphosis (1958), 7 min&quot; - In Gyromorphosis, film maker Hy Hirsh strives to display the kinetic qualities of the New Babylon structures of Constant Nieuwenhuys. One by one he puts parts of the structures in motion and films the details with colored lighting having them overlap each other, appear and disappear. He creates a sensation of acceleration and suspense suggested by the work itself.

&quot;Accompanying Simon Vinkenoog to Constant&#x27;s New Babylon (1962), 15 min&quot; - Lies Westenburg visits Constant at his studio with writer Simon Vinkenoog. Simon Vinkenoog and Constant discuss the ideas behind the New Babylon project.

&quot;Constant oder der Weg nach New Babylon (1968), 55 min&quot; - For ten years Constant worked on his &quot;New Babylon&quot; project as a reaction to the architectural and social reality. Film maker Carlheinz Caspari follows Constant and his visions.

&quot;Cobra, a revolt against order (1986), 50 min&quot; - Documentary by Jan Vrijman about the meaning and influence of the COBRA group, then and now.

&quot;Constant, Avant le Départ (2005), 82 min&quot; - Constant died in the summer of 2005. Thomas Doebele and Maarten Schmidt filmed the artist during the last months of his life. They followed him and his dog, Tikus, on their daily stroll to the artist&#x27;s studio, where he finished his last painting &quot;Le Piège&quot;.

&quot;New Babylon de Constant (2005), 13 min&quot; - New Babylon visually captured by Constant&#x27;s son Victor Nieuwenhuijs and Maartje Seyfert.
