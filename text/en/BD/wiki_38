<text>The is a historical period of Japanese history corresponding to the reign of Emperor Shōwa (Hirohito) from December 25, 1926, until his death on January 7, 1989. It was preceded by the Taishō era and succeeded by the Heisei era.
The pre-1945 and post-war Shōwa periods are almost completely different states: the pre-1945 Shōwa era (1926–1945) concerns the Empire of Japan, and post-1945 Shōwa era (1945–1989) concerns the State of Japan.

Before 1945, Japan moved into political totalitarianism, ultranationalism and statism, culminating in Japan&#x27;s invasion of China in 1937, part of a global period of social upheavals and conflicts such as the Great Depression and the Pacific War.

Defeat in the Pacific War brought about radical change in Japan. For the first and only time in its history, Japan was occupied by foreign powers, an American-led occupation which lasted for six years and eight months. Allied occupation brought forth sweeping democratic reforms. It led to the formal end of the emperor&#x27;s status as a demigod and the transformation of Japan from a form of mixed constitutional and absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary system with a liberal democracy. In 1952, with the Treaty of San Francisco, Japan became a sovereign state again. The postwar Shōwa period was characterized by the Japanese economic miracle.

The Shōwa era was longer than the reign of any previous Japanese emperor. Emperor Shōwa was both the longest-lived and longest-reigning historical Japanese emperor as well as the longest-reigning monarch in the world at the time. On 7 January 1989, Crown Prince Akihito succeeded to the Chrysanthemum Throne upon the death of his father, Emperor Shōwa, which marked the start of the Heisei era. Emperor Hirohito was served by total of 33 prime ministers, beginning with Wakatsuki Reijiro and ending with Noboru Takeshita.

== Etymology ==
The two kanji characters in Shōwa () were from a passage of the Chinese Book of Documents: (Translated: &quot;[T]he people (of his domain), ... all became brightly intelligent. (Finally), he united and harmonized the myriad states.&quot;) From this same quotation, Japan also adopted the era name Meiwa () during the Edo period in the late-18th century. There were two other candidates at the time – Dōwa () and Genka ().

The term could be roughly understood as meaning &quot;enlightened peace&quot; or in some interpretations &quot;radiant Japan&quot;.

In his enthronement address which was read to the people, the Emperor referenced this era name:

I have visited the battlefields of the Great War in France. In the presence of such devastation, I understand the blessing of peace and the necessity of concord among nations.

== End of &quot;Taishō Democracy&quot; ==
The election of Katō Takaaki as the Prime Minister of Japan continued democratic reforms that had been advocated by influential individuals on the left. This culminated in the passage of universal adult male suffrage in May 1925. General Election Law gave all male subjects over the age of 25 the right to vote, provided they had lived in their electoral districts for at least one year and were not homeless. The electorate thereby nearly quadrupled in size, from 3.3 million to 12.5 million.

However the forces of reaction grew more powerful and steadily; after 1925 there was a retreat from reform, liberal policies and democracy. Pressure from the conservative right forced the passage of the Peace Preservation Law of 1925 along with other anti-left-wing legislation, only ten days before the passage of universal manhood suffrage. The Peace Preservation Act curtailed activism on the left—which was not extensive—and the screws were steadily tightened. It outlawed groups that sought to alter the system of government or to abolish private ownership. The small leftist movements that had been galvanized by the Russian Revolution were subsequently crushed and scattered. This was in part due to the Peace Preservation Act, but also due to the general fragmentation of the left. Conservatives forced the passage of the Peace Preservation Law because the party leaders and politicians of the Taishō era had felt that, after World War I, the state was in danger from revolutionary movements. The Japanese state never clearly defined a boundary between private and public matters and, thus, demanded loyalty in all spheres of society. Subsequently, any ideological attack, such as a proposal for socialist reforms, was seen as an attack on the very existence of the state. The meaning of the law was gradually stretched to academic spheres. After the passage of the Peace Preservation Law and related legislation, &quot;kokutai&quot; emerged as the symbol of the state. Kokutai was seen as the barrier against communist and socialist movements in Japan. With the challenge of the Great Depression on the horizon, this would be the death knell for parliamentary democracy in Japan.

== Washington Conference to Mukden Incident ==
After World War I, the Western Powers, influenced by Wilsonian ideology, attempted an effort at general disarmament. At the Washington Naval Conference of 1921–1922, the Great Powers met to set limits on naval armament. The Five Power Naval Limitation Agreement worked out in Washington limited competition in battleships and aircraft carriers to a ratio of 5:5:3 (in terms of tonnage) for the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan respectively. Japanese ultra-nationalists viewed this as an attempt by Western powers to curb Japanese expansionism in an area of the globe over which they had no interest. However, those in power in Japan readily agreed to the disarmament, realizing that the global taste for war had been soured after the First World War and knowing that, the ratio was sufficient to maintain hegemony in the Pacific.

In 1924, however, friendly U.S.–Japanese relations were torpedoed by the Immigration Act of 1924. The act closed off Japanese immigration to the United States and dropped Japanese immigrants to the level of other Asians (who were already excluded). The overwhelming reaction in Japan, both at the highest levels and in mass rallies that reflected angry public opinion, was hostile and sustained. Commentators suggested the opening guns of a race war and called for a new buildup of the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces.

The Shōwa financial crisis was a financial panic in 1927, during the first year of the reign of Emperor Hirohito. It was a precursor of the Great Depression. It brought down the government of Prime Minister Wakatsuki Reijirō and led to the domination of the zaibatsu over the Japanese banking industry.

From 1928 to 1932, a domestic crisis could no longer be avoided. As the left was vigorously put down by the state, the economic collapse brought new hardship to the people of Japan. Silk and rice prices plummeted and exports decreased 50%. Unemployment in both the cities and the countryside skyrocketed and social agitation came to a head.

Meanwhile, the London Naval Treaty was ratified in 1930. Its purpose was to extend the Washington Treaty System. The Japanese government had desired to raise their ratio to 10:10:7, but this proposal was swiftly countered by the United States. Thanks to back-room dealing and other intrigues, though, Japan walked away with a 5:4 &quot;advantage&quot; in heavy cruisers, but this small gesture would not satisfy the populace of Japan, which was gradually falling under the spell of the various ultra-nationalist groups spawning throughout the country. As a result of his failings regarding the London Naval Treaty, Prime Minister Hamaguchi Osachi was shot on November 14, 1930, by an ultranationalist and died in 1931.

By this time, the civilian government had lost control of the populace. A &quot;New York Times&quot; correspondent called Japan a country ruled by &quot;government by assassination&quot;. The army, moving independently of the proper government of Japan, took the opportunity to invade Manchuria in the summer of 1931.

Since the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, Japan had maintained a military presence in Manchuria. On September 18, 1931, the Mukden Incident occurred. There was a small explosion on the tracks of a Japanese railway, north of Mukden. Japan invaded Manchuria in the aftermath. The Imperial Japanese Army mobilized the Kwantung Army and attacked Chinese troops. The Minseito government, headed by Hamaguchi&#x27;s successor Wakatsuki Reijirō, was unable to curb the army&#x27;s offensive. The Kwantung Army conquered all of Manchuria and set up the puppet state of Manchukuo on March 1, 1932. The last Emperor of China, Puyi, was installed as the puppet ruler of Manchukuo. The Diet, now dominated by army officials, voted to withdraw from the League of Nations. The first seeds of the coming conflict had been sown.

== Rise of nationalism ==
Prior to 1868, most Japanese more readily identified with their feudal domain rather than the idea of &quot;Japan&quot; as a whole. When the Tokugawa shogunate was overthrown, the leaders of the revolt, Satsuma and Chōshū, were ideologically opposed to the house of Tokugawa since the Battle of Sekigahara. The Meiji era changed all of that. With the introduction of mass education, conscription, industrialization, centralization, and successful foreign wars, Japanese nationalism began to foment as a powerful force in society. Mass education and conscription served as a means to indoctrinate the coming generation with &quot;the idea of Japan&quot; as a nation state instead of a series of &quot;daimyōs&quot;. In this way, loyalty to feudal domains was supplanted with loyalty to the central government. Industrialization and centralization gave the Japanese a strong sense that their country could once more rival and dominate Western powers technologically and socially. Moreover, successful foreign wars gave the populace a sense of martial pride in their country.

The rise of Japanese nationalism paralleled the growth of nationalism within the West. Certain conservatives such as Gondō Seikei and Asahi Heigo saw the rapid industrialization of Japan as something that had to be tempered. During the Meiji era, such nationalists railed against the unequal treaties, but in the years following the First World War, Western criticism of Japanese imperial ambitions and restrictions on Japanese immigration changed the focus of the nationalist movement in Japan.

Japanese nationalism was buoyed by a romantic concept of Bushidō and driven by a modern concern for rapid industrial development and strategic dominance in East Asia. It saw the Triple Intervention of 1895 as a threat to Japanese success in East Asia and warned that the &quot;ABCD Powers&quot; (America, Britain, China, and the Dutch), were threatening the Empire of Japan. One solution was war.

During the first part of the Shōwa era, racial discrimination against other Asians was habitual in Imperial Japan, having begun with the start of Japanese colonialism. The Shōwa regime thus preached racial superiority and racialist theories, based on sacred nature of the Yamato-damashii. One of Emperor Shōwa&#x27;s teachers, historian Kurakichi Shiratori, remarked, &quot;Therefore nothing in the world compares to the divine nature (shinsei) of the imperial house and likewise the majesty of our national polity (kokutai). Here is one great reason for Japan&#x27;s superiority.&quot;

The Anti-Comintern Pact brought Nazi ideologues to Japan who attempted but ultimately failed to inject Nazi-style anti-Semitic arguments into mainstream public discussion. Where the government presented the popular image of Jews, it was not so much to persecute but to strengthen domestic ideological uniformity.

The antisemitic policies of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Nazi Germany were refused when foreign minister of Japan Yōsuke Matsuoka stated that: &quot;Nowhere have I promised that we would carry out his anti-Semitic policies in Japan. This is not simply my personal opinion, it is the opinion of Japan, and I have no compunction about announcing it to the world.&quot;

Imperial Japanese Army General Kiichiro Higuchi and Colonel Norihiro Yasue allowed 20,000 Jews to enter Manchukuo in 1938. Higuchi and Yasue were well regarded for their actions and were subsequently invited to the independence ceremonies of the State of Israel. Diplomat Chiune Sugihara wrote travel visas for over 6,000 Lithuanian Jews to flee the German occupation and travel to Japan. In 1985, Israel honored him as &quot;Righteous Among the Nations&quot; for his actions.

== Military state ==

The withdrawal from the League of Nations meant that Japan was politically isolated. Japan had no strong allies and its actions had been internationally condemned, whilst internally popular nationalism was booming. Local leaders, such as mayors, teachers, and Shinto priests were recruited by the various movements to indoctrinate the populace with ultra-nationalist ideals. They had little time for the pragmatic ideas of the business elite and party politicians. Their loyalty lay to the Emperor and the military. In March 1932 the &quot;League of Blood&quot; assassination plot and the chaos surrounding the trial of its conspirators further eroded the rule of democratic law in Shōwa Japan. In May of the same year a group of right-wing Army and Navy officers succeeded in assassinating the Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi. The plot fell short of staging a complete coup d&#x27;état, but it effectively ended rule by political parties in Japan.

From 1932 to 1936, the country was governed by admirals. Mounting nationalist sympathies led to chronic instability in government. Moderate policies were difficult to enforce. The crisis culminated on February 26, 1936. In what became known as the February 26 Incident, about 1,500 ultranationalist army troops marched on central Tokyo. Their mission was to assassinate the government and promote a &quot;Shōwa Restoration&quot;. Prime Minister Okada survived the attempted coup by hiding in a storage shed in his house, but the coup only ended when the Emperor personally ordered an end to the bloodshed.

Within the state, the idea of a Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere began to foment. The nationalists believed that the &quot;ABCD powers&quot; (Americans, British, Chinese, Dutch) were a threat to all Asians and that Asia could only survive by following the Japanese example. Japan had been the only Asian and non-Western power to industrialize itself successfully and rival great Western empires. While largely described by contemporary Western observers as a front for the expansion of the Japanese army, the idea behind the Co-Prosperity Sphere was that Asia would be united against the Western powers under the auspices of the Japanese. The idea drew influence in the paternalistic aspects of Confucianism and . Thus, the main goal of the Sphere was the , the unification of the eight corners of the world under the rule () of the Emperor.

The reality during this period differed from the propaganda. Some nationalities and ethnic groups were marginalized, and during rapid military expansion into foreign countries, the Imperial General Headquarters tolerated many atrocities against local populations, such as the experimentations of Unit 731, the , the use of chemical and biological weapons, and civilian massacres such as those in Nanjing, Singapore and Manila.

Some of the atrocities were motivated by racism. For instance, Japanese soldiers were taught to think of captured Chinese as not worthy of mercy.

== Second Sino-Japanese War ==
On July 7, 1937, at the Marco Polo Bridge, the Japanese Kwantung army stationed there used explosions heard on the Chinese side of Manchuria as a pretext for invasion. The invasion led to a large-scale war known as the Second Sino-Japanese War approved by the Emperor that was called a &quot;holy war&quot; (&quot;Seisen&quot;) in Imperial propaganda.

At the time, China was divided internally between the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which was under the leadership of Mao Zedong, and the Nationalist government of China, the Kuomintang (KMT), which was under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek.

The years of 1937–38 were a time of rapid and remarkable success by the Japanese, who had a number of advantages over the Chinese army. While the Japanese army possessed a smaller force of armour and artillery than many Western powers, it was far ahead of China in this respect, and was also in command of the world&#x27;s third largest navy with 2,700 watercraft at its disposal.

By the end of July 1937, the Japanese had slaughtered the elite 29th Army at Kupeikou and soon captured Beijing. From there, the Japanese advanced down south through the major railway lines (Peiping-Suiyan, Peiping-Hankow, and Tientsin-Pukow). These were easily conquered by the superior Japanese army.

By October, Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s best armies had been defeated at Shanghai. By the end of the year, the Chinese capital at Nanjing had also been seized. The use of brutal scorched earth tactics by both sides, the Chinese as in 1938 Yellow River flood and later by the Japanese with the Three Alls Policy, &quot;kill all, burn all, loot all&quot;, initiated in 1940, claimed millions of lives. The Chinese nationalists resorted to massive civilian guerrilla tactics, which fatigued and frustrated Japanese forces. Countless Chinese civilians were executed on the suspicion of being resistance fighters. Japanese war crimes at Nanking and other sites in China and Manchukuo have been well documented.

On December 13, 1937, the Imperial Japanese Army, following the capture of Nanjing, began the Nanjing Massacre (sometimes called the &quot;Rape of Nanking&quot;), which resulted in a massive number of civilian deaths including infants and elderly, and the large-scale rape of Chinese women. The exact number of casualties is an issue of fierce debate between Chinese and Japanese historians.

By 1939, the Japanese war effort had become a stalemate. The Japanese Army had seized most of the vital cities in China, including Shanghai, Nanjing, Beijing, and Wuhan. The Nationalists and the Communists, however, fought on from Chongqing and Yenan, respectively.

== Pacific War ==
Negotiations for a German-Japanese alliance began in 1937 with the onset of hostilities between Japan and China. On September 27, 1940, the Tripartite Pact was signed, creating the Rome-Tokyo-Berlin Axis. The alliance was shallow, with very little coordination or mutual help until the last two years of the war, when it was too late to make much difference.

By 1938, the United States increasingly was committed to supporting China and, with the cooperation of Britain and the Netherlands, threatening to restrict the supply of vital materials to the Japanese war machine, especially oil, steel and money. The Japanese army, after sharp defeats by the Russians in Mongolia, wanted to avoid war with the Soviet Union, even though it would have aided the German war against the USSR. The Emperor became fatalistic about going to war, as the military assumed more and more control. Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe was replaced by the war cabinet of General Hideki Tojo (1884–1948), who demanded war. Tōjō had his way and the attack was made on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, as well as British and Dutch strong points. The main American battle fleet was disabled, and in the next 90 days Japan made remarkable advances including the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, Malaya and Singapore.

The quagmire in China did not stall imperial ambitions for the creation of a Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. Indeed, the Second Sino-Japanese War fueled the need for oil that could be found in the Dutch East Indies. After the Imperial General Headquarters refused to remove its troops from China (excluding Manchukuo) and French Indochina, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt announced in July 1941 an oil embargo on Japan. The Imperial Japanese Navy, increasingly threatened by the loss of its oil supplies, insisted on a decision, warning the alternatives were a high risk war, that Japan might lose, or a certain descent into third class status and a loss of China and Manchuria. Officially the Emperor made the decision, but he was told by a key civilian official on 5 November 1941:

it is impossible, from the standpoint of our domestic political situation and of our self-preservation, to accept all of the American demands. ...we cannot let the present situation continue. If we miss the present opportunity to go to war, we will have to submit to American dictation. Therefore, I recognize that it is inevitable that we must decide to start a war against the United States. I will put my trust in what I have been told: namely, that things will go well in the early part of the war; and that although we will experience increasing difficulties as the war progresses, there is some prospect of success.

With the Emperor&#x27;s approval, Imperial General Headquarters launched the Greater East Asia War. It began with a surprise attack on the U.S. naval base in Hawaii at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Japan declared war to the United States, Dutch and British. This marked the start of the Pacific War theatre of World War II. For the next six months, the Japanese had the initiative and went on the offensive. Hong Kong was overrun on December 8, 1941. By the summer of 1942, the Japanese had conquered Burma, Siam, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines. The Empire of Japan was one of the largest in history. In 1942 the Empire of Japan was at its greatest extent with colonies in Manchuria, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, French Indochina, Burma and many Pacific islands.

The decisive naval/aerial Battle of Midway took place in early June 1942. That changed the momentum of the war. Japan was put on the defensive as the Americans pursued their policy of island hopping. Tokyo was repeatedly firebombed in 1945 and in the early spring and summer of 1945, Iwo Jima and Okinawa were seized by the Americans. Finally, the death agony of the Empire of Japan came in August 1945. On August 6, an atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, instantly killing approximately 70,000 people when the attack took place (plus another estimated 130,000 by 1960 due to after-effects). On August 8, the Soviet invasion of Manchuria began. The following day, a second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, killing approximately 40,000 people. These attacks with the new atomic weapons were a surprise. Japan lacked any atomic bomb technology and could not counter it. The government of the Empire of Japan (Prime Minister Kantarō Suzuki) surrendered on August 14. The official surrender ceremony was held on September 2.

Total Japanese military fatalities between 1937 and 1945 were 2.1 million; most came in the last year of the war. Starvation or malnutrition-related illness accounted for roughly 80 percent of Japanese military deaths in the Philippines, and 50 percent of military fatalities in China. The aerial bombing of a total of 69 Japanese cities appears to have taken a minimum of 400,000 and possibly closer to 600,000 civilian lives (over 100,000 in Tokyo alone, over 200,000 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined, and 80,000–150,000 civilian deaths in the battle of Okinawa). Civilian deaths among settlers who died attempting to return to Japan from Manchuria in the winter of 1945 were probably around 100,000.

===Imperial rule===
Japan launched multiple attacks in East Asia. In 1937, the Japanese Army invaded and captured most of the coastal Chinese cities such as Shanghai. On 22 September 1940, the Japanese invasion of French Indochina began. Japan took over French Indochina (Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia), British Malaya (Brunei, Malaysia and Singapore) as well as the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia). Thailand managed to stay independent by becoming a satellite state of Japan. On 13 April 1941, the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact was signed. In December 1941 to May 1942, Japan sank major elements of the American, British and Dutch fleets, captured Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies, and reached the borders of India and Australia. Japan suddenly had achieved its goal of ruling the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

The ideology of Japan&#x27;s colonial empire, as it expanded dramatically during the war, contained two somewhat contradictory impulses. On the one hand, it preached the unity of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, a coalition of Asian nations, directed by Japan, against Western imperialism. This approach celebrated the spiritual values of the East in opposition to the &quot;crass&quot; materialism of the West. In practice, however, the Japanese installed organizationally-minded bureaucrats and engineers to run their annexed territories, and they believed in ideals of efficiency, modernization, and engineering solutions to social problems. It was fascism based on technology and rejected Western norms of democracy. After 1945, the engineers and bureaucrats took over and turned the wartime techno-fascism into entrepreneurial management skills.

The Japanese government established puppet regimes in Manchuria and China; they were dismantled at the end of the war. The Army operated ruthless governments in most of the conquered areas but paid more favorable attention to the Dutch East Indies. The main goal was to obtain oil. The Dutch sabotaged their oil wells but the Japanese were able to reopen them. However most of the tankers taking oil to Japan were sunk by American submarines, so Japan&#x27;s oil shortage became increasingly acute. Japan sponsored an Indonesian nationalist movement under Sukarno. Sukarno finally came to power in the late 1940s after several years of battling the Dutch.

==Defeat and Allied occupation==
With the defeat of the Empire of Japan, the Allied Powers dissolved it and placed the territories under occupation. The Soviet Union was made responsible for North Korea, and annexed the Kuril Islands and the southern portion of the island of Sakhalin. The United States took responsibility for the rest of Japan&#x27;s possessions in Oceania and took over South Korea. China, meanwhile, plunged back into its civil war, with the Communists in control by 1949. General Douglas MacArthur, from the US, was put in charge of the Allied Occupation of Japan as the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers; he and his staff exerted wide but indirect power, for the decisions were carried out by Japanese officials.

A War Crimes Tribunal, similar to that at Nuremberg, was set up in Tokyo. On 3 May 1946, the prosecution began of Japanese military leaders for war crimes. Several prominent members of the Japanese cabinet were executed, most notably former Prime Minister Hideki Tojo. But the Emperor Hirohito was neither tried at the Tokyo trials nor dethroned, nor any members of the imperial family. Instead, under the Post-war Constitution, the Japanese Emperor was reduced to a figurehead nominal monarch without divine characteristics and is forbidden to play a role in politics.

Douglas MacArthur sought to break the power of the zaibatsu; Japan was democratized and liberalized along American &quot;New Deal&quot; liberal lines. Parliamentary party politics was restored. Old left-wing organizations such as the Social Democratic Party and the Japanese Communist Party reasserted themselves. The first post-war general election was held in 1946, and for the first time, women were allowed to vote.

On 3 May 1947, the Constitution of Japan went into effect. This changed the Empire of Japan into the State of Japan (Nihon Koku, 日本国) with a liberal democracy (constitutional monarchy and parliamentary system). pre-war Japanese military was disarmed completely and the absoluteness of the Emperor of Japan was repealed by the Post-war Constitution. Article 9 turned Japan into a pacifist country without a military.

In July 1947, the Japanese government, with the encouragement of the U.S. occupation forces, established a National Police Reserve (警察予備隊 &quot;Keisatsu-yobitai&quot;). This consisted of 75,000 men equipped with light infantry weapons. This was the first step of its post-war rearmament.

Shigeru Yoshida was elected as the Prime Minister of Japan from 1946 to 1947 and from 1948 to 1954. His policy, known as the &quot;Yoshida Doctrine&quot;, emphasized military reliance on the United States and promoted unrestrained economic growth. On 8 September 1951, the US-led Allied Occupation of Japan ended after the signing of the Treaty of San Francisco, which became effective on April 28, 1952. It restored the sovereignty of Japan. On the same day, the Security Treaty Between the United States and Japan was signed as Cold War tensions rose; it was later replaced by the 1960 Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States and Japan. The 1960 treaty requires the U.S. to protect Japan from external aggression. It allows United States forces to be stationed in Japan. Meanwhile, Japanese ground and maritime forces deal with internal threats and natural disasters. This established the U.S.–Japan alliance.

In mid-1952, The Coastal Safety Force (海上警備隊 &quot;Kaijō-keibitai&quot;) was founded. It was the waterborne counterpart of National Police Reserve.

By the late 1940s, there were two conservative parties (the Democratic Party and Liberal Party); after a series of mergers, they came together in 1955 as the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). By 1955, the political system stabilized in what was called the 1955 System. The two chief parties were the conservative LDP and the leftist Japan Socialist Party (JSP). Throughout the period 1955 to 2009, the LDP was dominant (with a brief interlude in 1993–94). The LDP was pro-capitalism, pro-American, and had a strong rural base.

== The &quot;Japanese Miracle&quot; ==

Japan&#x27;s remarkable economic growth in the decades following 1950 has been called the &quot;Japanese Miracle&quot;, as the economy grew three times faster than other major nations. It was achieved almost without foreign capital. The miracle slackened off in 1973 in the face of an upsurge in oil prices and the destabilization of international trade. By the mid-1990s the economy entered an era of stagnation and low growth that still persists.

Saburō Ōkita (1914–93), an economist, realized by 1942 that the war was lost; economic recovery that was published in 1945 as &quot;The Fundamental Directions for the Reconstruction of the Japanese Economy&quot;. He became foreign minister in 1979 and endeavored to integrate Japan economically and politically with the world economy.

From 1950 onward, Japan rebuilt itself politically and economically. Sugita finds that &quot;the 1950s was a decade during which Japan formulated a unique corporate capitalist system in which government, business, and labor implemented close and intricate cooperation&quot;.

Japan&#x27;s newfound economic power soon gave it dominant economic influence in the world. The Yoshida Doctrine and the Japanese government&#x27;s economic intervention spurred on an economic miracle on par with the record of West Germany. The Japanese government strove to spur industrial development through a mix of protectionism and trade expansion. The establishment of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) was instrumental in the Japanese post-war economic recovery. By 1954, the MITI system was in full effect. It coordinated industry and government action and fostered cooperative arrangements, and sponsored research to develop promising exports as well as imports for which substitutes would be sought (especially dyestuffs, iron and steel, and soda ash). Yoshida&#x27;s successor, Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda, began implementing economic policies which removed much of Japan&#x27;s anti-monopoly laws. Foreign companies were locked out of the Japanese market and strict protectionist laws were enacted.

Meanwhile, the United States under President Dwight D. Eisenhower saw Japan as the economic anchor for Western Cold War policy in Asia. Japan was completely demilitarized and did not contribute to military power, but did provide the economic power. The US and UN forces used Japan as their forward logistics base during the Korean War (1950–53), and orders for supplies flooded Japan. The close economic relationship strengthened the political and diplomatic ties, so that the two nations survived a major political crisis in 1960 involving left-wing opposition to the revision of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. The left failed to force the removal of large American military bases in Japan, especially on Okinawa Prefecture. Shimizu argues that the American policy of creating &quot;people of plenty&quot; was a success in Japan and reached its goal of defusing anti-capitalist protest on the left.

On 1 July 1954, the Self-Defense Forces Act (Act No. 165 of 1954) reorganized the National Security Board as the Defense Agency on July 1, 1954. Afterward, the National Security Force was reorganized as the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) (陸上自衛隊 &quot;Rikujō Jieitai&quot;). The Coastal Safety Force was reorganized as the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) (海上自衛隊 &quot;Kaijō Jieitai&quot;). The Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) (航空自衛隊 &quot;Kōkū Jieitai&quot;) was established as a new branch of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) (自衛隊 &quot;Jieitai&quot;). These are the de facto postwar Japanese army, navy and air force as the successor to the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy.

On 12 December 1956, Japan joined the United Nations.

In 1957, Japan was the first country to build dedicated railway lines for high-speed travel. In 1957, Odakyu Electric Railway introduced its 3000 series SE Romancecar train, setting a world speed record of 145 km/h (90 mph) for a narrow gauge train. This would lead to the design of the first Shinkansen, This record gave impetus for the design of the first 0 Series Shinkansen.

In 1960, Japan was wracked by the massive Anpo Protests against the revision of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty.

On 1 October 1964, the largest Japanese land reclamation project thus far was completed in Lake Hachirōgata. The village of Ōgata was established. Land reclamation work began at Lake Hachirōgata in April 1957.

On 1 October 1964, Tokaido Shinkansen was the first high-speed rail line in Japan and the oldest high-speed rail system in the world.

On 10 October 1964, Tokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics. This marked the first time that the Olympic Games were held in Asia.

In 1968, Japan surpassed West Germany to become the second largest economic power in the world. In the same year, the Ogasawara Islands were returned from US occupation to Japanese sovereignty. Japanese citizens were allowed to return.

By the 1970s, Japan ascended to great power status again. It had the world&#x27;s second largest economy after the United States. However, its military power was very limited due to pacifist policies and article 9 of the 1947 constitution. This made Japan an abnormal great power.

On 11 February 1970, the first successful launch of the Lambda 4S rocket placed the Japanese Ohsumi satellite on orbit.

On 20 December 1970, the Koza riot was a violent and spontaneous protest against the US military presence in Okinawa.

On 30 September 1971, the Zengakuren demonstrated and rioted in Tokyo against terms for the return of Okinawa from the US to Japanese control. They wanted to remove all American military presence.

On 24 November 1971, the Okinawa Reversion Agreement was ratified and returned the Okinawa Prefecture to Japanese sovereignty.

In 1974, Prime Minister Eisaku Satō was the first Asian to accept the Nobel Peace Prize.

In 1980, Japan became the biggest motor vehicle producing country in the world with 11,042,884 motor vehicles compared to the US&#x27;s 8,009,841.

The beginning of 1980s saw the introduction of Japanese anime into the American and western culture. In the 1990s, Japanese animation slowly gained popularity in the United States.

In 1985, the home video game industry was revitalized by the widespread success of the Nintendo Entertainment System. The success of the NES marked a shift in the dominance of the video game industry from the United States to Japan during the third generation of consoles.

==Legacy==
Memorials to the era include Shōwa Day, the Showa Memorial Park and National Showa Memorial Museum. There is a phenomenon of Shōwa nostalgia. In the 2020s, there were an increased number of programmes relating to the era, such as Takeda Tetsuya no Shōwa wa kagayaiteita, on the Broadcasting Satellite (BS) television channels. In 2020, a new genus, &quot;Showajidaia&quot;, and new family, Showajidaiidae, of nudibranch mollusks were named after the era.

<doc id="261243" wikidata="Q312608" url="?curid=261243" title="Nǃxau ǂToma">
<text>Nǃxau ǂToma (short: Nǃxau, alternative spelling Gcao Tekene Çoma; 16 December 1944 – 5 July 2003) was a Namibian bush farmer and actor who starred in the 1980 film &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; and its sequels, in which he played the Kalahari Bushman Xixo. &quot;The Namibian&quot; called him &quot;Namibia&#x27;s most famous actor&quot;.

==Biography==
Nǃxau was a member of the ǃKung people, one of several peoples known as Bushmen. N!xau was a Namibian who starred in the 1980 movie &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; and its sequels, in which he played the Kalahari Bushman Xixo.

He spoke Juǀʼhoan, Otjiherero, and Tswana fluently, as well as some Afrikaans. He did not know his exact age, and before his appearance in the films he had little experience beyond his home. He had only ever seen three white people before casting, and when director Jamie Uys gave him his first cash payment of $300 for &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot;, he allegedly let it blow away in the wind because he did not understand its value. This was despite money already being a serious matter for other San since many of them depended on purchased food and government aid and/or had enlisted in the South African Army due to the high wages it paid. He was, however, able to negotiate for near several hundred thousand for his appearance in the sequel. He came from a culture that did not value the material things that money could buy and consequently had not learned money management skills, although he used some of his income to build a brick house with running water and electricity for his family. He also bought a used car and subsequently hired a chauffeur, as he had no desire to learn to drive.

Nǃxau converted to Christianity and in July 2000, he was baptized as a Seventh-day Adventist.

He was found dead in late June 2003 near his home in Namibia after going out to collect wood and on an excursion to hunt guineafowl. He died from multiple-drug-resistant tuberculosis. According to official estimates, he was about 58 or 59 years old at the time. He was buried on 12 July in a semi-traditional ceremony at Tsumkwe, next to the grave of his second wife. He had six surviving children.

==Career==
In addition to &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot;, Nǃxau starred in a series of sequels: &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy II&quot;, &quot;Crazy Safari&quot;, &quot;Crazy Hong Kong&quot; and &quot;The Gods Must Be Funny in China&quot;. After his film career ended, he returned to Namibia, where he farmed maize, pumpkins, and beans, and kept several heads of cattle (but no more than 20 at a time because, according to &quot;The Independent&quot;, without the complex farming systems of the &quot;modern world&quot;, he had trouble keeping track of more). The Namibian local daily &quot;New Era&quot; stated that he simply could not count further than 20.

<doc id="261247" wikidata="Q2585651" url="?curid=261247" title="Defense Superior Service Medal">
<text>The Defense Superior Service Medal (DSSM) is a military decoration of the United States Department of Defense, which is presented to United States Armed Forces service members who perform superior meritorious service in a position of significant responsibility.

It is most often presented to general and flag officers, followed by a lesser number of Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Space Force colonels and Navy and Coast Guard captains. Presented in the name of the United States Secretary of Defense, it was established by President Gerald R. Ford on February 6, 1976 in . It is analogous and senior to the Legion of Merit, albeit awarded for service in a joint duty capacity.

==Criteria==
The Defense Superior Service Medal is the United States Department of Defense&#x27;s second-highest non-combat-related military award and the second-highest joint service decoration. It is given by the Secretary of Defense to members of the United States Armed Forces who render superior meritorious service in a position of great responsibility. This service must be part of a joint activity. The award is generally for a period of time exceeding 12 months and encompassing an entire joint assignment. Service members assigned to or attached to a Joint Task Force as individuals, not members of a specific military service&#x27;s unit, can be eligible. It has also been awarded to a small cohort of U.S. military officers serving as astronauts for service leading up to and during Space Shuttle missions carrying classified and unclassified Department of Defense payloads. In these cases, the 12-month time period was considered to include the training period prior to that flight, which typically exceeded a year in duration.

Members of service-specific units are eligible for awards of personal decorations from their parent service. The DSSM specifically recognizes exceptionally superior service, and to honor a person&#x27;s accomplishments over a sustained period. Joint or Department of Defense awards, including the DSSM, may be awarded posthumously.

==Appearance==
At its time of creation, it was decided the DSSM would be obtained at the lowest possible cost and with as little involvement as possible. For these reasons, and because it would rank just below the Defense Distinguished Service Medal for similar service, it was decided to use the same design as the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, finished in silver rather than gold, and with the inscriptions on the medal&#x27;s reverse appropriately modified.

The medal is made of a silver-colored metal with blue enamel, and is high. The obverse depicts a silver American eagle superimposed over a medium blue pentagon. The eagle has outstretched wings, with the shield of the United States charged on its breast. In its talons are three crossed arrows in silver. The tips of the wings cover a surrounding arc of silver five-pointed stars encircling the top and sides of the pentagon, while the bottom is surrounded by a silver wreath encircling the base composed of a laurel branch on the left and an olive branch on the right.

The reverse is plain except for the inscription at the top, &quot;For Superior Service&quot;. Below in the pentagon is the inscription &quot;From The Secretary of Defense To&quot;.

The medal is suspended from a ribbon wide composed of these vertical stripes: Golden Yellow , Bluebird , White , Scarlet , White , Bluebird Golden Yellow .

Subsequent awards of the Defense Superior Service Medal are denoted by oak leaf clusters worn on the suspension and service ribbons of the medal.

<doc id="261248" wikidata="Q1046461" url="?curid=261248" title="Postwar Japan">
<text>Postwar Japan is the period in Japanese history beginning with the surrender of Japan to the Allies of World War II on 2 September 1945, and lasting at least until the end of the Shōwa era in 1989.

Despite the massive devastation it suffered in the Second World War, Japan established itself as a global economic power at peace with the world after the Allied-occupation ended on 28 April 1952 by the Treaty of San Francisco. In terms of political power it was more reluctant, especially in the nonuse of military force. The post-war constitution of 1947 included Article 9, which restricted Japan from having a military force and engaging in war. However, it has operated military forces in the stationing of the United States Forces Japan based on the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty after the Allied occupation and the form of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces since 1954.

Over the years, the meaning of Article 9 has been interpreted differently, because the United States now encourages Japan to control its own security and to join their military strategy more. The Liberal Democratic Party would like to see the Constitution and Article 9 amended.

== Politics ==
The Allied occupation ended on 28 April 1952, when the terms of the Treaty of San Francisco went into effect. By the terms of the treaty, Japan regained its sovereignty, but lost many of its possessions from before World War II, including Korea (by 1948, divided into the Republic of Korea (South Korea) and the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (North Korea), Taiwan (the Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek, retreated to the island after losing control over mainland China to Mao&#x27;s CCP in the Chinese Civil War, leading to the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China) and Sakhalin (regained by the Soviet Union and now under Russian jurisdiction). It also lost control over a number of small islands in the Pacific which it administered as League of Nations Mandates, such as the Marianas and the Marshalls. The new treaty also gave Japan the freedom to engage in international defence blocs. Japan did this on the same day it signed the San Francisco Treaty: The U.S. insisted, and Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida agreed, to a treaty that allowed the American military to continue their use of bases in Japan.

Even before Japan regained full sovereignty, the government had rehabilitated nearly 80,000 people who had been purged, many of whom returned to their former political and government positions. A debate over limitations on military spending and the sovereignty of the emperor ensued, contributing to the great reduction in the Liberal Party&#x27;s majority in the first post-occupation elections (October 1952). After several reorganizations of the armed forces, in 1954 the Self-Defense Forces were established under a civilian director. Cold War realities and the hot war in nearby Korea also contributed significantly to the United States-influenced economic redevelopment, the containment of the Soviet Union and Communist China, and the support for organized labor in Japan.

Continual fragmentation of parties and a succession of minority governments led conservative forces to merge the Liberal Party (Jiyuto) with the Japan Democratic Party (Nihon Minshuto), an offshoot of the earlier Democratic Party, to form the Liberal Democratic Party (Jiyu-Minshuto; LDP) in November 1955. This party continuously held power from 1955 through 1993, when it was replaced by a new minority government. LDP leadership was drawn from the elite who had seen Japan through the defeat and occupation; it attracted former bureaucrats, local politicians, businessmen, journalists, other professionals, farmers, and university graduates. In October 1955, socialist groups reunited under the Japan Socialist Party, which emerged as the second most powerful political force. It was followed closely in popularity by the Kōmeitō, founded in 1964 as the political arm of the Soka Gakkai (Value Creation Society), a lay former organization of the Buddhist sect Nichiren Shoshu. The Komeito emphasized traditional Japanese beliefs and attracted urban laborers, former rural residents, and many women. Like the Japan Socialist Party, it favoured the gradual modification and dissolution of the Japan-United States Mutual Security Assistance Pact.
By the late 1970s, the Komeito and the Democratic Socialist Party had come to accept the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, and the Democratic Socialist Party even came to support a small defense buildup. The Japan Socialist Party, too, was forced to abandon its once strict antimilitary stance. The United States kept up pressure on Japan to increase its defense spending above 1% of its GNP, engendering much debate in the Diet, with most opposition coming not from minority parties or public opinion but from budget-conscious officials in the Ministry of Finance.

Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka was forced to resign in 1974 because of his alleged connection to financial scandals and, in the face of charges of involvement in the Lockheed bribery scandal, he was arrested and jailed briefly in 1976.

The fractious politics of the LDP hindered consensus in the Diet in the late 1970s. The sudden death of Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira just before the June 1980 elections, however, brought out a sympathy vote for the party and gave the new prime minister, Zenko Suzuki, a working majority. Suzuki was soon swept up in a controversy over the publication of a textbook that appeared to many as a whitewash of Japanese aggression in World War II. This incident, and serious fiscal problems, caused the Suzuki cabinet, composed of numerous LDP factions, to fall.

Yasuhiro Nakasone, a conservative backed by the still-powerful Tanaka and Suzuki factions who once served as director general of the Defense Agency, became prime minister in November 1982. In November 1984, Nakasone was chosen for a second term as LDP president. His cabinet received an unusually high rating, a 50% favorable response in polling during his first term, while opposition parties reached a new low in popular support. As he moved into his second term, Nakasone thus held a strong position in the Diet and the nation.
Despite being found guilty of bribery in 1983, Tanaka in the early-to-mid-1980s remained a power behind the scenes through his control of the party&#x27;s informal apparatus, and he continued as an influential adviser to the more internationally minded Nakasone. The end of Nakasone&#x27;s tenure as prime minister in October 1987 (his second two-year term had been extended for one year) was a momentous point in modern Japanese history. Just fifteen months
before Nakasone&#x27;s retirement, the LDP unexpectedly had won its largest majority ever in the House of Representatives by securing 304 out of the 512 seats. The government was faced with growing crises. Land prices were rapidly increasing due to the Japanese asset price bubble, inflation increased at the highest rate since 1975, unemployment reached a record high at 3.2%, bankruptcies were rife, and there was political rancor over LDP-proposed tax reform. In the summer of 1987, economic indicators showed signs of recovery, but on October 20, 1987, the same day Nakasone officially named his successor, Noboru Takeshita, the Tokyo Stock Market crashed. Japan&#x27;s economy and its political system had reached a watershed in their postwar development that would continue to play out into the 1990s.

== Economy ==
The early post-war years were devoted to rebuilding lost industrial capacity: major investments were made in electric power, coal, steel, and chemicals. By the mid-1950s, production matched prewar levels. Released from the demands of military-dominated government, the economy not only recovered its lost momentum but also surpassed the growth rates of earlier periods. Between 1953 and 1965, GDP expanded by more than 9% per year, manufacturing and mining by 13%, construction by 11%, and infrastructure by 12%. In 1965 these sectors employed more than 41% of the labor force, whereas only 26% remained in agriculture.

Japan&#x27;s highly acclaimed post-war education system contributed strongly to the modernizing process. The world&#x27;s highest literacy rate and high education standards were major reasons for Japan&#x27;s success in achieving a technologically advanced economy. Japanese schools also encouraged discipline, another benefit in forming an effective work force.

The mid-1960s ushered in a new type of industrial development as the economy opened itself to international competition in some industries and developed heavy and chemical manufactures. Whereas textiles and light manufactures maintained their profitability internationally, other products, such as automobiles, electronics, ships, and machine tools assumed new importance. The value added to manufacturing and mining grew at the rate of 17% per year between 1965 and 1970. Growth rates moderated to about 8% and evened out between the industrial and service sectors between 1970 and 1973, as retail trade, finance, real estate, information technology, and other service industries streamlined their operations.

The LDP government, through institutions such as Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), encouraged Japanese industrial development overseas while restricting foreign companies&#x27; business within the country. These practices, coupled with a reliance on the United States for defense, allowed Japan&#x27;s economy to increase exponentially during the Cold War. By 1980, many Japanese products, particularly automobiles and electronics, were being exported around the world, and Japan&#x27;s industrial sector was the second-largest in the world after the U.S. This growth pattern stagnated after 1991.

The 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo marked the re-emergence of Japan in the international arena: Japan&#x27;s postwar development was showcased through innovations such as the Shinkansen high-speed rail network. In 1968, the first modern office skyscraper called the Kasumigaseki Building was built in Japan. It has 36 floors and is 156 meters high.

The high economic growth and political tranquillity of the mid-to-late 1960s were tempered by the quadrupling of oil prices by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 1973. Almost completely dependent on imports for petroleum, Japan experienced its first recession since World War II.

Labor unions had been destroyed by the government by 1940. The American occupation forces, reflecting their New Deal American values, supported a revival. Communist unions were included, although a proposed nationwide general strike was forbidden in 1947. After 1970, union membership declined in both Japan and the United States. According to Wythe Holt, in both countries workers had adopted consumer lifestyle and have gained the education needed to move out of blue collar jobs. Furthermore, there has been frustration with the top-down, bureaucratic management by union leaders who seem to show little interest in the aspirations of the workers.

== Foreign relations ==

Despite its central position in the world economy, Japan has played a modest role in global politics for much of the postwar period.

The 1950s were largely marked by Japan re-establishing relations to numerous nations and redefining its international role, e.g., by joining the United Nations in 1956. One such total redefinition were Japan&#x27;s relations to its former World War II-ally Germany, which were put on a new basis in 1955 focused on trade.

Japan&#x27;s biggest postwar political crisis took place in 1960 over the revision of the Japan-United States Mutual Security Assistance Pact. As the new Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security was concluded, which renewed the United States role as military protector of Japan, massive street protests and political upheaval occurred, and the cabinet resigned a month after the Diet&#x27;s ratification of the treaty. Thereafter, political turmoil subsided. Japanese views of the United States, after years of mass protests over nuclear armaments and the mutual defense pact, improved by 1968 and 1972 respectively, with the reversion of United States-occupied Nanpō and Ryukyu Islands to Japanese sovereignty and the winding down of the Vietnam War.

Japan had reestablished relations with the Republic of China after World War II, and cordial relations were maintained with the nationalist government when it was exiled to Taiwan, a policy that won Japan the enmity of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which was established in 1949. After the general warming of relations between China and Western countries, especially the United States, which shocked Japan with its sudden rapprochement with Beijing in 1971 (the Ping Pong Diplomacy), Tokyo established relations with Beijing in 1972. Close cooperation in the economic sphere followed.

Japan&#x27;s relations with the Soviet Union continued to be problematic after the war, but a Joint Declaration between Japan and the USSR, ending the war and reestablishing diplomatic relations was signed October 19, 1956. The main object of dispute was the Soviet occupation of what Japan calls its Northern Territories, the two most southerly islands in the Kurils (Iturup and Kunashiri) and Shikotan and the Habomai Islands (northeast of Hokkaido), which were seized by the Soviet Union shortly after Japan&#x27;s World War II surrender.

Under the premiership of Kakuei Tanaka (1972–74), Japan took a stronger but still low-key stance by steadily increasing its defense spending and easing trade frictions with the United States. Tanaka&#x27;s administration was also characterized by high-level talks with United States, Soviet, and Chinese leaders, if with mixed results. His visits to Indonesia and Thailand prompted riots, a manifestation of long-standing anti-Japanese sentiments.

Several cordial visits between Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and U.S. President Ronald Reagan were aimed at improving relations between their countries. Nakasone&#x27;s more strident position on Japanese defense issues made him popular with some United States officials but not, generally, in Japan or among Asian neighbors. Although his characterization of Japan as an &quot;unsinkable aircraft carrier&quot;, his noting the &quot;common destiny&quot; of Japan and the United States, and his calling for revisions to Article 9 of the Constitution (which renounced war as the sovereign right of the nation), among other prorearmament statements, produced negative reactions at home and abroad, a gradual acceptance emerged of the Self-Defense Forces and the mutual security treaty with the United States in the mid-1980s.

Another issue in relations with the U.S. was Japan&#x27;s growing trade surplus, which reached record heights during Nakasone&#x27;s first term. The United States pressured Japan to remedy the imbalance, demanding that Tokyo raise the value of the yen and open its markets further to facilitate more imports from the United States. Because the Japanese government aids and protects its key industries, it was accused of creating an unfair competitive advantage. Tokyo agreed to try to resolve these problems but generally defended its industrial policies and made concessions on trade restrictions very reluctantly.

== Culture ==

Japan continued to experience Westernization in the postwar era, much of which came about during the occupation, when American soldiers were a common sight in many parts of the country. American music and movies became popular, spurring a generation of Japanese artists who built on both Western and Japanese influences.

During this period, Japan also began to emerge as an exporter of culture. Young people across the world began consuming &quot;kaiju&quot; (monster) movies, &quot;anime&quot; (animation), &quot;manga&quot; (comic books), and other modern Japanese culture. Japanese authors such as Yasunari Kawabata and Yukio Mishima became popular literary figures in America and Europe. American soldiers returning from the occupation brought with them stories and artifacts, and the following generations of U.S. troops in Japan contributed to a steady trickle of martial arts and other culture from the country.

<text>Outdoor cooking is the preparation of food in the outdoors. A significant body of techniques and specialized equipment exists for it, traditionally associated with nomad in cultures such as the Berbers of North Africa, the Arab Bedouins, the Plains Indians, pioneers in North America, and indigenous tribes in South America. These methods have been refined in modern times for use during recreational outdoor pursuits, by campers and backpackers.

Currently, much of the work of maintaining and developing outdoor cooking traditions in Westernized countries is done by the Scouting movement and by wilderness educators such as the National Outdoor Leadership School and Outward Bound, as well as by writers and cooks closely associated with the outdoors community.

==Food and recipes==
The type of food common in outdoors settings is somewhat different compared to household foods and also differs depending on the type of cooking activity. While someone at a public campground may have easy access to a grocery store and be able to prepare plenty of recipes with fresh meat and vegetables, someone on an extended trip into the backcountry will not be able to carry large amounts of fresh food, due to the extra weight from high water content, and will have to rely heavily on food with low water content, such as dried meats and vegetables, packaged dehydrated camping foods, and starches such as ramen, polenta, and dried potato flakes. Wilderness experts in both categories sometimes make use of locally available wild foods as well, particularly wild vegetables and fruit but also occasionally fresh fish and wild game; however, it is not unusual for camping food, especially backcountry food, to be partially or totally vegetarian.

Camping food is often very high in fat and carbohydrates to provide energy for long hikes, and hikers (much like soldiers) must rely heavily on energy-packed snacks such as trail mix, chocolate, energy bars, and sports drinks. Water can also be at a premium, so important parts of a camper&#x27;s pantry include chlorine or iodine-based water disinfectants as well as drink mixes to mask the flavor of the chemical treatment.

Recipes are often designed with significant planning and home preparation in mind, with certain ingredients mixed at home and then cooked on the trail; to that end, there are several providers of freeze-dried food, both ingredients and full meals, to the outdoors market, and just-add-water instant meals (including hot cereals, pasta or rice in sauce, and instant soup) from the supermarket are popular as well. Alternatively, some wilderness experts advocate bulk rationing, in which each hiker is given a selection of raw ingredients and prepares a meal from scratch on the trail.

==Methods==

Most outdoor cooking is dictated by the foods themselves which are to be cooked. The first five discussions below, of direct heat, boiling, frying, grilling, and roasting, will, perhaps, describe the cooking methods employed most often in outdoor cooking. These techniques will require only rudimentary, commonsensical tools. Additional methods described further below may be of interest only to those &quot;foodies&quot; who carry their interests into the outdoors for gourmet meals. These advanced methods may require additional equipment or techniques.

===Direct heat===

The most traditional method for outdoor cooking (and indeed the oldest form of cooking known to humanity) is using a campfire. Campfires can be used for cooking food by several techniques. The techniques for cooking on a campfire are no different from those used for everyday cooking before the invention of stoves or when stoves were still not available. Individuals who are backpacking in an area that allows the gathering of firewood may decide to cook on a campfire to avoid the need to carry extra equipment; however, most campfire cooking is done in outside of wilderness areas. Cooking food using a campfire can be tricky for those not accustomed to it; also, due to the risk of fire damage, campfires are illegal in many areas, so many campers prefer to use a portable stove instead.

====Boiling====
In backpacking particularly, boiling water is the most common kitchen operation undertaken on the trail, used for cooking or reconstituting food, making hot beverages, cleaning up, and even sanitizing drinking water. Portable stoves are therefore generally rated in terms of how quickly they can boil a liter (or another appropriate size) of water; indeed, some commercial stove models are specifically optimized for fast boiling, with other operations such as frying or baking being an afterthought.

Like camp frying pans, camp pots are generally made of very lightweight material (often aluminum or, at a considerable price premium, titanium). Though less of a worry given the thermal mass of water, the camp cook must still take care not to allow food to burn, since the pot itself has very little mass to spread the heat out.

Alternatively, a fireproof container (e.g. mess can, bamboo segment or improvised tree bark pot) is placed (or hung) above the fire.

====Roasting====
Possibly the simplest method of cooking over a campfire and one of the most common is to roast food on long skewers that can be held above the flames. This is popular for cooking hot dogs or toasting marshmallows for making s&#x27;mores. Hungarians often roast slab bacon (Szalonna) over a campfire. Besides skewers and fireplace popcorn poppers, pie irons too may be used (small iron molds with long handles), into which can be placed slices of bread with some form of filling — which are placed over hot coals to cook. When using meat, roasting can have the advantage over grilling in that the grease that drips from the food can be reused. This can be done by placing a fireproof container under the food.

====Grilling====

Grills are simple to use and food being grilled tends to pick up some flavor from the smoke, although that is not by design as in a Barbecue where the meat is cooked slowly over hours at a significantly lower temperature. Grills over a campfire are used in the same way as an ordinary backyard charcoal grill. If the food is simply placed on the grill, it may catch fire so it requires constant attention. Hand-held grills, aka broilers that clamp over the food may be used for various tasks like warming food, grilling burgers or sausages or making toast. In cases where open fires are not allowed, lightweight charcoal grills (sometimes considered a type of hibachi) are sometimes used for direct grilling of food.

====Frying====
Frying is not always necessary, but is often used for fish or wild game caught while on the trip, as well as pancakes and certain kinds of bread and desserts made on the trail. As a general rule, the frying medium used in camp cooking is usually either vegetable oil or margarine. Normal (salted) butter may also be appropriate for camp use, but unsalted butter or lard may not be, due to their shorter shelf life.

Camp frying pans often lack handles for easy packing, with the camp cook using a clamp-like device to pick up and move the pan. Camp frying pans are generally made out of very thin metal (though some campers do use cast iron pans for this purpose as well), so extra care must be taken to evenly cook the food, especially over the small-diameter flame of a portable stove. A &quot;round the clock&quot; technique, where the frying pan is moved repeatedly to expose different parts of its base to the flame, is the most commonly recommended solution to the problem, though it is also possible to use a flame diffuser to achieve the same effect. For campfire use, on the other hand, some camp cooks prefer a legged cast-iron pan called a &quot;spider&quot;, which is elevated to allow a small fire directly beneath it.

Camp cooks making pancakes in a moderate-size pan often simplify their work and speed up their service by pouring enough batter to make one large, moderate-thickness pancake that takes up the entire pan and then cutting the final product with the spatula to serve individual portions. Also, camp cooks often replicate toast using a frying pan: a bread slice (or more, or a combination of whole and cut portions) is placed in a well-greased pan, pressed down with a spatula, flipped, and pressed down again.

An improvised griddle can be made by putting a flat stone directly on the fire (or above it, on top of other stones). Food is then placed on the stone.

====Baking====

Putting a baking sheet pan over a furnace can allow for baking, which is in turn derived from the concept of the masonry oven. This was common for centuries, used to make bread, pies, and other items, and is still popular today, particularly among campers who enjoy stuffing their meats. Ovens can be made from cast iron, sheet metal, or aluminum foil-covered cardboard boxes. Reflector ovens are metal containers designed to surround an article of food being baked over an open flame and reflect the heat towards the food.

====Dutch ovens and other pots====

Closely associated with the American Old West, the Dutch oven of tradition is a heavy cast iron pot, traditionally made with three short legs and a concave cover for holding hot coals on top. While such pots are generally considered too heavy for backpackers, Dutch ovens are often used in group camp-outs and cookouts.

Dutch ovens were traditionally specially designed for camping, and such pots (often with legs and a handle, both for suspending the pot over a fire) are still widely available, though sometimes at a premium over flat-bottomed stove-top models. The oven is placed in a bed of hot coals, often from a keyhole fire with additional coals placed on top of the lid, which in camp ovens usually has a raised rim to keep the coals from falling off. Dutch ovens are made of cast iron or aluminium and are generally not considered suitable for backpacking due to the heavy weight of the pot. Dutch ovens are convenient for cooking dishes that take a long time such as stews, joints of meat, and baked goods. They are not the only option for baking on a campout as devices for baking on portable stoves exist and clay ovens can be constructed at longer encampments.
A pot hanging over the fire, although picturesque, may spill, and the rigging may be difficult to construct from found wood. Generally, this is done with metal rigging, much of it identical to that historically used in home fireplaces before the invention of stoves. Two vertical iron bars with an iron cross-piece allow pots to be hung at various heights or over different temperatures of fire. Griddles, grills, and skewers can also be hung over the fire. When working with wood, one may use two tripods, lashed with tripod lashings, but the rope will be liable to melt or burn. Dovetail joints are more secure but difficult to carve.


A good alternative to cooking with a tripod is to cook directly on the fire itself. To do this properly the fire needs to have a reasonable bed of coals and to have burned down to the point where it is not a roaring fire. While the pot may be set directly upon the coals, this is not preferable since that will tend to extinguish the coals. To lift the pot up off the fire, often two small logs of similar size may be used on either side of the pot; camp-style Dutch ovens have three legs built into the pot to perform this function. An alternative is the use of a metal thread or mesh fire basket. This allows continued airflow through the fire while providing optimal heat. The one downside to this form of cooking is that the pots will become blackened with soot and ash, which can be difficult to scrub off. The ash and soot buildup can be easily avoided by applying a thin layer of dish soap (preferably biodegradable) to the outside of the pot before cooking. The ash and soot will stick to the soap which is then easily rinsed off later.

====Steaming====

Steaming is possible with plants such as bamboo. In this method, a piece of bamboo is set diagonally above a fire. The bamboo is perforated from within (between the joints) and water is placed in the lowest bamboo segment. Food (e.g. rice) is then placed in the top segment which is steamed due to the water evaporating from the heat in the lowest segment.

====Other covered techniques====

The original form of covered cooking is the earth oven, simply a covered pit with a fire built in it, demonstrated in techniques such as the Polynesian umu/Hāngī, the Indian tandoori, and the Native American clambake.

Another commonly used technique is the baking of food in aluminum foil packets. Food is wrapped inside a durable packet of tin or aluminum foil, crimped to seal, and placed on or under hot coals. Baked potatoes are commonly cooked this way but entire meals can be cooked in one packet. Besides aluminum or tin, organic material such as leaves (of trees, &quot;Nelumbo nucifera&quot; lotus, &quot;Dendrocalamus lactiferous Munro&quot; bamboo aka Bambusa oldhamii (麻竹葉), phragmites, plantain, taro, etc.), husks (of corn, &quot;Phyllostachys makinoi&quot; bamboo (桂竹籜), etc.), and skins of fruit (citrus, etc.) are also frequently employed. Tree leaves such as those from the banana tree do not burn/ignite as they contain enough oil to resist the heat from the flames (at least until the frying is complete). The way to adapt recipes where food is wrapped in foil is to use a barrier such as baking or silicone paper between the food and the foil; the overall technique is similar to the en papillote technique developed in French cuisine but uses a more robust container.

Other simple methods include clay wrapping food (such as in the &quot;kleftiko&quot; method used in Greek cuisine), leaf wrapping, and plank grilling, where food is cooked on a wooden plank set above the fire. Hot-stone cooking, where food is placed on a heated stone next to or even in the fire, or where fire-heated stones are dropped into a pot are other methods.

Long-distance truckers, automotive travelers, and rally racers have occasionally resorted to cooking on accessible sections of the vehicle engine; the book &quot;Manifold Destiny&quot;, though written to a certain extent as a humor book, is considered the authoritative reference on the subject. The food is usually wrapped in several layers of aluminum foil and secured onto the engine block or other hot parts of the engine.

In some areas where there is a significant amount of steady, less-hazardous volcanic activity, &quot;lava cooking&quot; (invented in Hawaii) is sometimes practiced as a novelty. The food does not come in direct contact with the molten rock, instead being wrapped in a moist barrier (usually wet tropical leaves such as banana foliage or ti leaves). The wrapper is sacrificial, and is chipped or otherwise cleaned off along with the cooled lava before serving.

==Backwoods cooking, without utensils==

Backwood cooking is a method of cooking without the use of kitchen implements. It commonly takes place in the backwoods, often in combination with wild or conventional camping. Some variants of backwoods cooking allow the use of items of cookware such as a cooking pot; however there are many recipes without any. Some backwoods alternatives to cookware include aluminium foil, fruit skins, and heated stones. Traditionally backwoods cooking takes place over a wood-burning fire because wood is the most available fuel source in the backwoods. As a result, some recipes include information about the intensity of the fire to be used.

Backwoods cooking is widely practiced within the Scouting movement. While it is most associated with scouting today, the term &quot;backwoods cooking&quot; pre-dates Scouting by at least 25 years. Within scouting it may also be known as &quot;lightweight cooking,&quot; which may also have a focus on using aluminum foil for cookware for much lighter-weight cooking.

Scouts around the world take part in different backwoods cooking competitions. These competitions are often local in scope, group or district competitions, but some are held by national scout associations; such as that held by the Scout Association of Malta.

==Specialist equipment==

Portable stoves are widely used in areas where fuel such as wood is scarce or there is a significant fire or environmental hazard to building a campfire. Such devices usually use liquid fuel (usually a petroleum derivative or some kind of alcohol), but gaseous fuels like propane, butane and solid fuels such as wood shavings and hexamine are also used depending on the stove design; while two-burner models are commonly used for front-country camp stoves and function much like residential gas stoves, backpacking stoves generally put out a much more concentrated and less powerful flame and require lightweight cooking equipment (&quot;billycans&quot;) made of aluminum or titanium rather than more typical kitchen-type utensils.

In addition, there are often special techniques for baked goods made on the trail in the absence of specialized camp oven equipment, including flipping over the (lidded) pan while on the heat and the &quot;twiggy fire&quot;, which mimics the use of charcoal on the lid of a Dutch oven using a small campfire on the lid of the pan.

Reflector ovens are placed on the ground next to the fire, and gather thermal radiation from it.

Solar cookers are a type of equipment that is powered by the sun, and no other fuel is required, creating a positive environmental impact. There are large variations of design and functionality, where the parabolic solar cookers offer the highest temperature, often more than 750 degrees F. SolSource solar stove is an example of a high-temperature solar stove.

Ceramic grills come in many guises and have been around in simple format since ancient times. Many modern cookers sport ornate designs that can be quite beautiful. These grills cook well and efficiently because they retain heat and seal in moisture. Most quality grills are weatherproof and can be used year-round to grill, BBQ, smoke, and bake. Other benefits include fast heating time and a lack of hot spots. They are fuel-efficient, using a minimum of charcoal, and may be safer for children due to the lack of hot spots.
==Cooking rigs==
==Dangers==

Outdoor cooking elements can be dangerous due to their high flammability and proximity to occupants. Use of highly flammable alcohols to refuel portable cookers, gas cookers need to be checked for leaks and kept well away from heat and tents in a sheltered and stable setting. Most modern tents are made of lightweight synthetic materials that are not fire retardant. Fires and flames must be properly extinguished and not left unattended. Wind can carry hot embers, possibly igniting wildfires. In rare occasions, portable camping canisters have been known to explode. These can be caused by leaks or overheating around the compressed canister. Adequate air ventilation can prevent overheating during use. It is recommended to operate such portable cooking instruments in the open, despite the pull of luxury in having them operate inside a tent. Several incidents involving camping and cooking fires have resulted in fatalities and severe injuries.

Special precautions are required for camping in the bear country because cooking activities and food storage attract these potentially dangerous animals. Food preparation and storage must be located a safe distance from sleeping areas, so a fire near the camp cannot be used for cooking. Food may need to be stored in bear cans or bear bags hung from a tree or post. Other animals may be attracted to food too; most notably raccoons, squirrels, skunks, and mice.

<text>In Polynesian folklore,  (also rendered as in Cook Islands, Hawaiki in Māori, in Samoan, in Tahitian, in Hawaiian) is the original home of the Polynesians, before dispersal across Polynesia. It also features as the underworld in many Māori stories.

Anne Salmond states &quot;Havaii&quot; is the old name for Raiatea, the homeland of the Māori. When British explorer James Cook first sighted New Zealand in 1769, he had Tupaia on board, a Raiatean navigator and priest. Cook&#x27;s arrival seemed to be a confirmation of a prophecy by Toiroa, a priest from Māhia. At Tolaga Bay, Tupaia conversed with the &quot;tohunga&quot; associated with the school of learning located there, called Te Rawheoro. The priest asked about the Māori homelands, &#x27;Rangiatea&#x27; (Ra&#x27;iatea), &#x27;Hawaiki&#x27; (Havai&#x27;i, the ancient name for Ra&#x27;iatea), and &#x27;Tawhiti&#x27; (Tahiti).

== Etymology==
Linguists have reconstructed the term to Proto-Nuclear Polynesian &quot;*sawaiki&quot;.

The Māori word figures in traditions about the arrival of the Māori in Aotearoa, present day New Zealand. The same concept appears in other Polynesian cultures, the name appearing variously as &quot;Havaiki&quot;, &quot;Havaii&quot;, or &quot;Avaiki&quot; in other Polynesian languages. &quot;Hawaiki&quot; or the misspelling &quot;Hawaiiki&quot; appear to have become the most common variants used in English. Although the Samoans have preserved no traditions of having originated elsewhere, the name of the largest Samoan island preserves a cognate with the word &quot;Hawaiki&quot;, as does the name of the Polynesian islands of (the denoting a glottal stop that replaces the &quot;k&quot; in some Polynesian languages).

On several island groups, including New Zealand and the Marquesas, the term has been recorded as associated with the mythical underworld and death. William Wyatt Gill wrote at length in the nineteenth century recounting the legends about Avaiki as the underworld or Hades of Mangaia in the Cook Islands. Gill (1876:155) records a proverb: &quot;Ua po Avaiki, ua ao nunga nei&quot; – &#x27;Tis night now in spirit-land, for &#x27;tis light in this upper world.&quot; Tregear (1891:392) also records the term Avaiki as meaning &quot;underworld&quot; at Mangaia, probably sourced from Gill. The proposed origin of Hawaiki being both the ancestral homeland and the underworld is that both are the dwelling places of ancestors and the spirits.

Other possible cognates of the word &quot;Hawaiki&quot; include (&quot;spirits&quot; in Samoan) and (&quot;chiefs&quot; in Tongan). This has led some scholars to hypothesize that the word &quot;Hawaiki&quot;, and, by extension, and , may not, in fact, have originally referred to a geographical place, but rather to chiefly ancestors and the chief-based social structure that pre-colonial Polynesia typically exhibited.

On Easter Island, the name of the home country in oral tradition appears as . According to Thor Heyerdahl, was said to lie east of the island. Sebastian Englert records:
: Translation: &quot;The island towards the sun, above! Go, see the island where King Hotu Matua will go and live!&quot;

Englert puts forward the claim that lies to the West of the island. The name is found in the Marquesas Islands, in the names of several islands: , and (although in the element may be a different word, ). It is also notable that in the Hawaiian Islands, the ancestral homeland is called , a cognate of Tahiti, where at least part of the Hawaiian population came from.

== Legends ==

According to various oral traditions, the Polynesians migrated from Hawaiki to the islands of the Pacific Ocean in open canoes, little different from the traditional craft found in Polynesia today.
The Māori people of New Zealand trace their ancestry to groups of people who reportedly travelled from Hawaiki in about 40 named waka (compare the discredited Great Fleet theory of the Polynesian settlement of New Zealand).

Polynesian oral traditions say that the spirits of Polynesian people return to Hawaiki after death. In the New Zealand context, such return-journeys take place via Spirits Bay, Cape Reinga and the Three Kings Islands at the extreme north of the North Island of New Zealand. This may indicate the direction in which Hawaiki may lie.

== Modern science and practical testing of theories ==
Until the early 21st century, many anthropologists had doubts that the canoe-legends described a deliberate migration. They tended to believe that the migration occurred accidentally when seafarers became lost and drifted to uninhabited shores.

In 1947 Thor Heyerdahl sailed the &quot;Kon-Tiki&quot;, a balsa-wood raft, from South America into the Pacific in an attempt to show that humans could have settled Polynesia from the eastern shores of the Pacific Ocean, with sailors using the prevailing winds and simple construction techniques.

However, DNA, linguistic, botanical, and archaeological evidence all indicate that the Austronesian-speaking peoples (including the Polynesians) probably originated from islands in eastern Asia, possibly from present-day Taiwan. From there they gradually migrated southwards and eastwards through the South Pacific Ocean.

The sweet potato, which is of South American origin, is widely cultivated in Polynesia. This suggests that some interaction between the Polynesians and the indigenous peoples of South America may have taken place. No Polynesian crops were introduced into the Americas, and there is possible evidence of Polynesian contact only in Chile. Austronesian and Polynesian navigators may have deduced the existence of uninhabited islands by observing migratory patterns of birds.

In recent decades, boatbuilders (see Polynesian Voyaging Society) have constructed ocean-going craft using traditional materials and techniques. They have sailed them over presumed traditional routes using ancient navigation methods, showing the feasibility of such deliberate migration that make use of prevailing winds.

<doc id="261257" wikidata="Q1353460" url="?curid=261257" title="Hypothetical imperative">
<text>A hypothetical imperative (German: &quot;hypothetischer Imperativ&quot;) is originally introduced in the philosophical writings of Immanuel Kant. This sort of imperative is contrasted with a categorical imperative.

== Overview ==
It is first mentioned in Section II of &quot;Groundworks of the Metaphysics of Morals.&quot; Kant defined it as the formula of the command of reason that represents an objective principle &quot;in so far as it is necessitating for a will&quot;, in other words, imperatives act as the empirical formulas for knowing and enacting with reason. Hypothetical imperatives tell us how to act in order to achieve a specific goal and the commandment of reason applies only conditionally, e.g. &quot;I must study to get a degree.&quot; To put it simply, a hypothetical imperative is the blueprint for the use of reason in the interest of achieving a goal.

These sort of actions are capable of producing good, but they are primarily motivated by a desire to meet specific purposes. Actions done via Hypothetical Imperatives are done very often; whenever one commits to perform an action in order to achieve something they desire, they have used this imperative to act with reason to their advantages.

In &quot;Groundworks of the Metaphysics of Morals,&quot; Kant divides hypothetical imperatives into two subcategories: the rules of skill and the counsels of prudence.

===Rules of skill===

The rules of skill are conditional and are specific to each and every person to which the skill is mandated by. These are particular ends that we assign ourselves, and they provide a framework to understand how our ends can be achieved. Kant summarizes it as, &quot;Whoever wills the end also wills (in so far as reason has decisive influence on his actions) the indispensably necessary means to it that is in his control.&quot; Kant&#x27;s definition provides that there are a countless number of personal ends that can exist, because each human being has their unique perspectives, desires, personal circumstances, and intended methods to reach their ends.

===Counsels of prudence===

The counsels of prudence (or rules of prudence) are attained &quot;a priori&quot; (unlike the rules of skill which are attained via experience, or &quot;a posteriori&quot;) and have universal goals such as happiness. Counsels of prudence are actions committed for the overall sake of good will for the individual, and with the best intentions. This assumes, then, that actions done with the best intentions are using the hypothetical imperative to discern and make decisions that are &quot;most moral good&quot;. Thus, almost any moral &quot;rule&quot; about how to act is hypothetical, because it assumes that your goal is to be moral, or to be happy, or to please God, etc.

===Limitations===

The general limitation of the hypothetical imperative is its potential ambiguity in its means, and its susceptibility to be misused for corrupted ends instead. Hypothetical imperatives also can only be acted upon if there is a personal investment in the action done and the ends produced. If one does not find personal benefit or incentive to conduct an action off a certain mean, then they are not obligated to do so. In other words, hypothetical imperatives invoke commands through &quot;ought to do&#x27;s&quot;, and their emphasis is more on individual personal desires. The only non-hypothetical imperatives are ones which tell you to do something no matter who you are or what you want, because the thing is good in itself. These types of imperatives belong to the category of categorical imperative.

<doc id="261259" wikidata="Q212879" url="?curid=261259" title="Kim Novak">
<text>Marilyn Pauline &quot;Kim&quot; Novak (born February 13, 1933) is an American retired actress and painter. Her contributions to cinema have been honored with two Golden Globe Awards, an Honorary Golden Bear, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Novak began her career in 1954 after signing a contract with Columbia Pictures, and quickly became one of Hollywood&#x27;s top box office stars, appearing in &quot;Picnic&quot; (1955), &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot; (1955), and &quot;Pal Joey&quot; (1957). She gained prominence for her performance in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s thriller &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958), which is recognized as one of the greatest films ever made. Other notable films include &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot; (1958), &quot;Strangers When We Meet&quot; (1960), and &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; (1964).

Although at the time still relatively young, Novak withdrew from acting by 1966 and has only sporadically worked in films since. She appeared in &quot;The Mirror Crack&#x27;d&quot; (1980), and had a regular role on the primetime series &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; (1986–1987). After a disappointing experience during the filming of &quot;Liebestraum&quot; (1991), she retired from acting.

==Early life==
Marilyn Pauline Novak was born in Chicago, Illinois on February 13, 1933. She is the second daughter of Joseph and Blanche (née Kral) Novak (who both appeared with her in the 1962 film &quot;The Notorious Landlady&quot;). Both of her parents were born in Chicago and of Czech descent. Joseph (1897–1987) was a history teacher who took a job as a freight dispatcher on the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad during the Great Depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;emanuellevy/profile/novak-kim&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Novak was raised Catholic.

Novak attended William Penn Elementary, Farragut High School, and Wright Junior College. She won two scholarships to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

During the summer break in her last semester of junior college, Novak went on a cross-country tour as a promotional model for &quot;Detroit Motor Products Corporation&quot;″s Deepfreeze home freezer at trade shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;lflbhistory/Spark-of-Genius&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Novak was pronounced &quot;Miss Deepfreeze&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lflb.passitdown/41803&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acting career==
===1953–1958: Early films and breakthrough===

In San Francisco, after the refrigerator company tour ended, Novak and two other models decided to travel to Los Angeles, to check out the film industry. In Los Angeles, the three, with her as Marilyn Novak, were extras in &quot;Son of Sinbad&quot; (filmed in 1953, released in 1955), and later, for &quot;The French Line&quot; (1953), starring Jane Russell at RKO.&lt;ref name=&quot;afi/Catalog/51664&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In Los Angeles, Novak was discovered by an agent, who signed her to a long-term contract with Columbia Pictures. From the beginning of her career, she wanted to be an original and not another stereotype. Therefore, Novak fought with Columbia&#x27;s CEO, Harry Cohn, over the changing of her name. Cohn suggested the name &quot;Kit Marlowe&quot;, arguing, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s gonna go see a girl with a Polack name!&quot;, but Novak insisted on keeping her name, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m Czech, but Polish, Czech, no matter, it&#x27;s my name!&quot; They eventually settled on the name &quot;Kim Novak&quot; as a compromise.

Columbia intended for Novak to be their successor to Rita Hayworth, their biggest star of the 1940s, whose career had declined; also, the studio was hopeful that Novak would bring them the same box-office success Marilyn Monroe brought 20th Century-Fox. Novak&#x27;s first role for the studio was in the film noir &quot;Pushover&quot; (1954), in which she received third billing below Fred MacMurray and Philip Carey. She then co-starred in the romantic comedy &quot;Phffft&quot; (1954) as Janis, a character who finds Robert Tracey (Jack Lemmon) &quot;real cute&quot;. Both films were reasonably successful at the box office, and Novak received favorable reviews for her performances. In her third feature film, &quot;5 Against the House&quot; (1955), a gritty crime drama, she received second billing after Guy Madison but above Brian Keith, all three above the title. It was only a minor critical and box-office success.

Novak then played Madge Owens in the film version of &quot;Picnic&quot; (1955), from the William Inge play, co-starring William Holden and Rosalind Russell. Its director, Joshua Logan, felt that it would be more in character for Novak to have red hair; she agreed to wear a red wig during filming. Logan says Harry Cohn suggested Novak appear in the film but did not insist upon it: the director tested her for the role several times and was delighted with her performance, feeling she was close to her character. &quot;Picnic&quot; was a resounding critical and box-office triumph, and Novak won a Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer. She was also nominated for the BAFTA Film Award for Best Foreign Actress but did not win. She appeared as a mystery guest on the game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; on February 5, 1956, to promote the film&#x27;s opening at the Radio City Music Hall. Director Otto Preminger then cast her in &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot; (1955), in which she played Frank Sinatra&#x27;s sultry ex-girlfriend. In a cast that included Eleanor Parker, Novak received praise for being one of the film&#x27;s bright spots, and the film was a box-office hit.
Novak&#x27;s next project, &quot;The Eddy Duchin Story&quot; (1956), cast her as Marjorie Oelrichs, the wife of pianist Eddy Duchin, played by Tyrone Power. Because the two leads did not get along during filming, Novak nearly considered backing out of the production but decided against it. At the time of its release, the film was a critical and box-office hit, with many suggesting that Novak&#x27;s advertisements for No-Cal diet soda contributed positively to the film&#x27;s success. Offered a choice for her next project, she selected the biopic &quot;Jeanne Eagels&quot; (1957), in which she portrayed the stage and silent-screen actress who was addicted to heroin. Co-starring Jeff Chandler, the film was a largely fictional account of Eagels&#x27; life. The film drew negative reviews but turned a profit at the box office. Eagels&#x27; family sued Columbia over the way Eagels had been depicted in the movie.

After appearing in a series of successful movies, Novak became one of the biggest box-office draws of 1957 and 1958. Columbia then placed her in a film adaptation of the musical &quot;Pal Joey&quot; (also 1957), based on the 1940 novel and Broadway play, both written by John O&#x27;Hara. Playing Linda English, a naive showgirl, she again co-starred opposite Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth. Released in October, the film received favorable reviews; &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;strong, funny entertainment,&quot; although Novak&#x27;s performance has generated a mixed reaction, partly because of noticeable lack of on-screen charisma. The movie was a box-office hit and has been considered one of Novak&#x27;s better performances.

===1958: &quot;Vertigo&quot;===

Director Alfred Hitchcock was working on his next film, &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958), when his leading actress, Vera Miles, became pregnant and had to withdraw from the complex role of Judy Barton. Hitchcock approached Harry Cohn to offer Novak the female lead without even requesting a screen test. Though Cohn hated the script, he allowed Novak to read it because he considered Hitchcock to be a great director. Novak loved it, as she could identify with the character and agreed to take part in the film without meeting Hitchcock. At the same time, she was striking for more money from Columbia and refused to show up for work on the &quot;Vertigo&quot; set to protest against her salary of $1,250 a week. Novak hired new agents to represent her and demanded an adjustment in her contract. Cohn, who was paid $250,000 for Novak to do &quot;Vertigo&quot;, suspended her, but after a few weeks of negotiations, he relented and offered her a new contract worthy of a major star. She was now receiving $3,000 a week and explained to the press, &quot;I don&#x27;t like to have anyone take advantage of me.&quot;
Novak finally reported for work, and according to Hitchcock, she had &quot;all sorts of preconceived notions&quot; about her character, including what she would and would not wear. Before shooting began, she told the director she did not like the grey suit and black shoes she was slated to wear, thinking them too heavy and stiff for her character. Novak later recalled, &quot;I didn&#x27;t think it would matter to him what kind of shoes I wore. I had never had a director who was particular about the costumes, the way they were designed, the specific colors. The two things he wanted the most were those shoes and that gray suit.&quot; Indeed, Hitchcock explained to Novak that the visual aspect of the film was even more important to him than the story, and insisted on her wearing the suit and the shoes that he had been planning for several months. Novak learned to make it work for her, as she saw it as a symbol of her character. Nonetheless, Hitchcock allowed Novak the freedom to develop the character herself. As she later recalled: &quot;It excites me to work on dual personalities because I think I have many myself. And I think that I was able to use so much of me in that movie. At first I was feeling insecure because I kept saying, &quot;Is this right? How do you want me to play this character?&quot; Hitchcock said: &quot;I hired you and that&#x27;s who I want, what you bring to this role. But what I do expect from you is to stand where I want you to, wear what I want you to and speak in the rhythm that I want you to.&quot; And he worked a long time with me to try to get the right rhythm.&quot; The role took on a personal significance for her, as she felt she went through the same thing as her character when she arrived in Hollywood: 
From my point of view, when I first read those lines where she says, &quot;I want you to love me for me,&quot; and all the talking in that scene, I just identified with it so much because going to Hollywood as a young girl and suddenly finding they want to make you over totally, it&#x27;s such a total change and it was like I was always fighting to show some of myself, feeling that I wanted to be there as well. It was like they&#x27;d do my hair and go and redo a bunch of things. So I really identified with the fact of someone that was being made over with the resentment, with wanting to. Needing approval and wanting to be loved and willing, eventually, to go to any lengths to get that by changing her hair and all of these different things. And then when Judy appears, it&#x27;s another story and then when she has to go through that change. I really identified with the movie because it was saying, &quot;Please, see who I am. Fall in love with me.&quot;
Novak described Hitchcock as a gentleman but found the experience of working with him to be strange. &quot;I don&#x27;t know if he ever liked me. I never sat down with him for dinner or tea or anything, except one cast dinner, and I was late to that. It wasn&#x27;t my fault, but I think he thought I had delayed to make a star entrance, and he held that against me. During the shooting, he never really told me what he was thinking.&quot; The director was actually frustrated to have her instead of Vera Miles, as Novak learned later. &quot;Hitchcock didn&#x27;t like having me in his picture and he felt I was ruining it. It was only after the film was finished that I heard how much he thought I&#x27;d wrecked his picture. I felt I did a lot of good work in that movie, and I got some of the best notices of my career. But Hitchcock couldn&#x27;t blame himself, so he blamed me.&quot; Novak got along well with her co-star, James Stewart, who supported her during the filming of the movie. &quot;He treated me so well. I learned a lot about acting from him. When we had emotional scenes, he had to prepare himself first by somehow going deep inside of himself, and you knew to leave him alone when he was like that. And when it was over, he wouldn&#x27;t just walk away. He allowed himself to slowly come out of it. He&#x27;d hold my hand and I would squeeze his hand so that we both had time to come down from the emotion.&quot;
The film had mixed reviews at the time of its release and broke even at the box office, but has since been re-evaluated and is widely considered one of the director&#x27;s best works. In the 2012 British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll, &quot;Vertigo&quot; was voted as the best film of all time. Novak surprised film critics. Bosley Crowther, writing for &quot;The New York Times,&quot; described her as &quot;really quite amazing&quot;, and the &quot;Variety&quot; review noted that she was &quot;interesting under Hitchcock&#x27;s direction&quot; and &quot;nearer an actress than she was in either &quot;Pal Joey&quot; or &quot;Jeanne Eagels.&quot;&quot; Film critic David Thomson thought it was &quot;one of the major female performances in the cinema&quot; and film director Martin Scorsese called it &quot;extraordinary&quot;, adding that Novak&#x27;s work was &quot;so brave and emotionally immediate&quot;. However, Novak was disappointed by her performance when she watched the film in 2013. &quot;I was really disappointed. Both characters were exaggerated. They&#x27;ll always remember me in &quot;Vertigo&quot;, and I&#x27;m not that good in it, but I don&#x27;t blame me because there are a couple of scenes where I was wonderful.&quot;

===1958–1965: Career decline and other ventures===

Novak again worked with Stewart in Richard Quine&#x27;s &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot; (also 1958), a comedy tale of modern-day witchcraft also starring Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs that proved to be a box-office success. She then starred opposite Fredric March in the acclaimed romantic drama &quot;Middle of the Night&quot; (1959), which she has described as not only her favorite of her films, but also cites her performance in the film as her best.

Novak starred opposite Kirk Douglas in the romantic drama &quot;Strangers When We Meet&quot; (1960), which drew mixed reviews but was a success financially. Richard Quine was the director, as well as her fiancé at the time. The studio planned to give them the house that was built as part of the storyline during the filming as a wedding gift, but their wedding never occurred. Instead, during the last film that Quine and she made together, the British mystery/comedy &quot;The Notorious Landlady&quot; (1962) with Jack Lemmon and Fred Astaire, she discovered and purchased her future home by the sea near Big Sur in central California. It became her retreat and sanctuary after leaving Hollywood.

Novak made an independent five-picture deal, with producer Martin Ransohoff and Filmways Pictures to co-produce, but it proved to be a bad choice owing to clashes with personalities over scripts. Their first endeavor, the comedy &quot;Boys&#x27; Night Out&quot; (1962), was unsuccessful. After her Hollywood house survived the big Bel Air Fire of 1961, it was finally lost a few years later when it was swept away with most of her belongings in a mudslide in 1966. During the interim, she made W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s drama &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; (1964) with Laurence Harvey in Ireland. This third film adaptation of the famous story went over schedule and budget, and it also failed.

The sex comedy &quot;Kiss Me, Stupid&quot; (1964) with Dean Martin followed for director Billy Wilder. Actor Peter Sellers had originally been selected and begun filming, but he had suffered a heart attack, so Ray Walston substituted at the last minute. The film had problems getting released because of conflicts with the Legion of Decency. The film opened to scathing reviews and while it made money, it did not help Novak&#x27;s career. Years later it was rediscovered and acclaimed for its forward thinking and got rave reviews, particularly for Novak&#x27;s performance as &quot;Polly the Pistol&quot;.

Novak starred in the historical comedy &quot;The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders&quot; (1965) in England with British actor Richard Johnson. Inspired by the similar movie &quot;Tom Jones&quot;, it drew negative reviews but was a moderate success at the box office. Novak married Johnson in 1965 and divorced him in the spring of 1966. The divorce was amicable and they remained friendly.

In 1966, Novak was cast as the female lead in the occult-themed mystery &quot;Eye of the Devil&quot;, co-starring David Niven and Donald Pleasence. The film&#x27;s premise intrigued Novak, but she found the filming difficult and unpleasant. Novak was forced to leave the film after she fell off a horse, resulting in serious injuries which took time to recover from and she was replaced by Deborah Kerr.

===1966–1991: Acting sporadically===
By the end of 1966, she was emotionally drained and no longer wanted to live the life of a Hollywood movie star, in the glare of the spotlight with the press scrutinizing her every move. When a mudslide took her Bel Air home and cost her entire life&#x27;s savings in bulldozer fees, she moved away from Hollywood to Big Sur. From then on, acting became a job and was no longer a career of choice. Novak preferred to concentrate on her first love, the visual arts, often writing poetry to accompany her paintings, and even writing some song lyrics. Harry Belafonte and the Kingston Trio recorded some of her folk songs in the 1960s.
Novak returned to the screen for &quot;The Legend of Lylah Clare&quot; (1968), starring Peter Finch and Ernest Borgnine, and directed by Robert Aldrich. She played a dual role, portraying a person who becomes possessed by a look-alike film actress who gets made over by her obsessive-compulsive director lover. Robert Aldrich asked Novak to do a German accent for that role, but she felt it was unbelievable and over the top, so she did not want to do it, and he never insisted. At the premiere, Novak was shocked to hear her voice had been dubbed by a German actress in many scenes. Aldrich had never told her, nor had he given her the opportunity to dub it herself. The film was aggressively scorned by critics and Novak drew some of the worst reviews of her career. It was also a box office disaster. She was extremely upset and regretted having starred in the film. The last film Novak made in the &#x27;60s was the Western comedy &quot;The Great Bank Robbery&quot; (1969), opposite Zero Mostel, Clint Walker, and Claude Akins.

After nearly four years that she described as a &quot;self-imposed vacation&quot;, Novak agreed to take part in two projects. She returned to the screen with a role in the horror anthology film &quot;Tales That Witness Madness&quot; (1973). Novak also starred as Las Vegas chorus girl Gloria Joyce, a character with whom she could identify, in the made-for-TV movie, &quot;The Third Girl From the Left&quot; (1973), with her real-life boyfriend at the time, Michael Brandon. Novak admitted a preference for TV films as she thought they were faster to shoot than features. She described movie scripts of that time as offensive, saying she disliked the unnecessary sex she found in most of them. In 1975, Novak took part in the ABC movie &quot;Satan&#x27;s Triangle&quot; because she was intrigued by the story, which dealt in the supernatural. Novak had a small role in &quot;The White Buffalo&quot; (1977), a Western starring Charles Bronson, and she ended the decade by playing Helga in &quot;Just a Gigolo&quot; (1979), opposite David Bowie. Both films were flops, but Novak was not blamed due to her minor roles in them.
In 1980, Novak played fictional actress Lola Brewster in the British mystery-thriller &quot;The Mirror Crack&#x27;d&quot;, based on the story by Agatha Christie. She co-starred alongside Angela Lansbury, Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson, and Elizabeth Taylor. She enjoyed making the film and got along with her co-stars and the film was moderately successful. Novak did not appear in any feature films during the remainder of the 1980s. Her acting credits during the decade included the ensemble television movie &quot;Malibu&quot; (1983) and the pilot episode of &quot;The New Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; (1985). Producers of the successful primetime soap opera &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; offered Novak a role in their series similar to her character in &quot;Vertigo&quot;. She appeared as the secretive &quot;Kit Marlowe&quot; in 19 episodes from 1986 to 1987. It was Novak&#x27;s idea to name her character Kit Marlowe, as it was the stage name that Columbia had wanted her to use when she started in the business. The former Marilyn Pauline Novak wryly described this turn of events as effectively being Cohn&#x27;s revenge on her from beyond the grave.

In 1989, Novak appeared along with James Stewart as a presenter at the 61st Academy Awards. Asked in the press room about a possible comeback, Novak said that if someone sent her a script she really wanted to do, with a part she felt she could not turn down, she would be happy to go back to work on the big or little screen. At the same time, Novak turned down plenty of offers for movies, as well as an opportunity to appear in a second season of &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, to write her autobiography, tentatively titled &quot;Through My Eyes&quot;. Novak decided to re-establish contact with her agent and seek challenging roles after she realized she was not satisfied artistically. She said at the time, &quot;I feel that I didn&#x27;t live up to what I should have done with it. In other words, I&#x27;m glad I made the move away from Hollywood: I don&#x27;t regret that. I know that was a major thing and a good thing. But by the same token, it was like unfinished business.&quot; She returned to film with the leading role of Rose Sellers in &quot;The Children&quot; (1990) opposite Ben Kingsley. A British-German coproduction, the film premiered at the London Film Festival and received good reviews. Leonard Maltin praised the acting and felt Novak&#x27;s performance was &quot;excellent&quot;. However, following disputes between the director Tony Palmer and the distributor over editing and music, the film was pulled from release and never distributed.
Director Mike Figgis offered Novak the role of a terminally ill writer with a mysterious past in his thriller &quot;Liebestraum&quot; (1991) opposite Kevin Anderson and Bill Pullman. Novak loved the script and thought it was going to be an important picture. However, her collaboration with Figgis was tense and the two had conflicts from the beginning. Novak agreed to do the film under the impression she was going to play the whole character, but Figgis felt she was unable to play the flashback role the way he wanted, and hired actress Sarah Fearon for those scenes. The two clashed on the set, as their visions of the script differed and were in many ways diametrically opposed. Although she considered him to be a brilliant director, she felt the story was too personal for him, as it was about his own life, and Novak was playing his mother. She was also unhappy, as she felt he wanted her to act like a puppet. &quot;He wanted what he thought Hitchcock had made over. But Hitchcock didn&#x27;t do that. Figgis didn&#x27;t know Hitchcock. So he treated me the way he thought Hitchcock must have, tried to manipulate me into doing exactly... I went crazy.&quot; Novak later said she was hurt and distraught, as &quot;It was such a painful thing for me because it took me right back to Harry Cohn and all that time. And back into saying, Look, for God&#x27;s sake, haven&#x27;t you heard it enough? We don&#x27;t want you to do anything. Just be &#x27;Kim Novak.&#x27; That movie pained me more than any movie in the world could do.&quot; Novak later told &quot;Movieline&quot; in 2005 she felt she had been &quot;unprofessional&quot; not to obey her director. &quot;I know he thinks I&#x27;m a total bitch. That role was fabulous, full of depth. When I interpreted it the way I thought was evident in the incredible script, he said, &#x27;We&#x27;re not making a Kim Novak movie, just say the lines. If you continue to play the role this way, I&#x27;m going to cut you out of the movie,&#x27; and he pretty much did that.&quot;
Novak was supposed to do a comedy with the French director Claude Berri, also starring Peter Falk, and a remake of &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot; with Sharon Stone. Neither film was made, and following the difficult experience with &quot;Liebestraum,&quot; she has usually cited that experience as the reason for her decision to retire from the film industry. In 2004, she told the Associated Press:I got so burned out on that picture that I wanted to leave the business, but then if you wait long enough you think, &quot;Oh, I miss certain things.&quot; The making of a movie is wonderful. What&#x27;s difficult is afterward when you have to go around and try to sell it. The actual filming, when you have a good script—which isn&#x27;t often—nothing beats it.

===1992–present: Retirement===

After her retirement from acting, Novak made only rare public appearances and turned down most offers she received. In 1996, &quot;Vertigo&quot; was given a restoration by Robert A. Harris and James C. Katz and re-released to theaters. Novak enjoyed their work so much, she agreed to make appearances at screenings of the film, something she had refused when Universal asked her in 1984. She also took part in &quot;Obsessed with Vertigo,&quot; a documentary retracing the making and restoration of the film. In 1997, Novak received an Honorary Golden Bear Award for lifetime achievement at the 47th Berlin International Film Festival.

In 2003, Novak was presented with the Eastman Kodak Archives Award for her major contribution to film. Prior honorees include Greta Garbo, Audrey Hepburn, James Stewart, Martin Scorsese, and Meryl Streep. During that time, Novak received several offers to do some major films and to appear on high-profile television shows. She made an appearance on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; in 2004, where she stated she would consider returning to the screen &quot;if it was the right role.&quot; In 2010, Novak was the recipient of a special tribute from the American Cinematheque in Hollywood, where her films were shown at Grauman&#x27;s Egyptian Theatre. She made a rare personal appearance with a Q&amp;A onstage between a showing of &quot;Pal Joey&quot; and &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot;, earning a two-minute-long standing ovation upon her entrance.

In April 2012, Novak was honored at the TCM Classic Film Festival, where she introduced a screening of &quot;Vertigo&quot;. She joined in conversation with Robert Osborne for a Q&amp;A session in which she discussed her career and personal life. The hour-long interview aired on TCM as &quot;Kim Novak: Live from the TCM Classic Film Festival&quot; on March 6, 2013. Novak broke down in tears while discussing &quot;Liebestraum.&quot; As she nearly sobbed in front of the audience, Novak said, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t do a movie after that. I&#x27;ve never done a movie after that. I just couldn&#x27;t do a movie after that.&quot; The interview was an eye-opener for many fans who had wondered why Novak made so few films. Acknowledging that she never reached her potential as an actress, Novak revealed to the audience that she was bipolar and explained, &quot;I was not diagnosed until much later. I go through more of the depression than the mania part.&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t think I was ever cut out to have a Hollywood life,&quot; Novak also commented. &quot;Did I do the right thing, leaving? Did I walk out when I shouldn&#x27;t have? That&#x27;s when I get sad.&quot; On the possibility of acting again, Novak said in another interview, with the fashion website &quot;LifeGoesStrong,&quot; &quot;Who knows what the future holds? It would take an awful lot to lure me out there, but I would never say never.&quot; Also during the TCM Festival, Novak was honored in a handprint and footprint ceremony at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre. That same year, Novak received the San Francisco Cinematic Icon Award from the San Francisco Museum and Historical Society.
After years of seclusion, Novak started to make public appearances more frequently as she felt her body of work was being more appreciated.
In 2013, she was recognized as the guest of honor by the Cannes Film Festival and attended the 2013 Festival, where she introduced a new restored version of &quot;Vertigo&quot;. She also took part in the festival&#x27;s closing ceremony as a presenter, earning a standing ovation upon her entrance.
In 2014, she was a presenter at the 86th Academy Awards. That same year, she appeared at the TCM Classic Film Festival, where she unveiled her painting &quot;Vertigo / Vortex of Delusion&quot; commissioned by the TCM network as part of their 20th anniversary. Novak also introduced a screening of her 1958 movie, &quot;Bell Book and Candle&quot;, during the Festival. Also in 2014, Novak was invited by Cunard Line to be a speaker on board during a New York-to-London cruise on &quot;RMS Queen Mary 2&quot;. She introduced screenings of &quot;Vertigo&quot; and &quot;Bell, Book and Candle,&quot; and did a Q&amp;A session with Hollywood expert Sue Cameron, who is also her manager. That same year, Novak appeared with both of her art mentors, Harley Brown and Richard McKinley, for a solo show of her paintings at the Butler Institute of American Art.

In 2015, Novak attended the 22nd Febiofest international film festival, where she received the Kristián Award for her contribution to world cinema and also had an exhibition of her paintings at the Strahov Monastery. She hosted special screenings of &quot;Vertigo&quot; featuring live performances of Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s score by members of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival and by members of the San Francisco Symphony at the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall in 2016. Also in 2016, Novak was invited by Turner Classic Movies to be a guest on their Caribbean Cruise where she sold five of her paintings and was able to raise nearly $7,000 for the prevention of teenage suicide with the auction of a framed giclée of her.

In 2018, Novak joined in conversation with Larry King for a Q&amp;A session at the Grauman&#x27;s Egyptian Theatre, in celebration of &quot;Vertigo&quot;&#x27;s 60th Anniversary. That same year, she was the recipient of a special sold-out tribute from the Castro Theatre.

==Honors==

In 1955, Novak won the Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer – Female. Two years later she won another Golden Globe for World Favorite Female Actress. On February 8, 1960, Novak was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 6332 Hollywood Boulevard. In 1995, Novak was ranked 92nd by &quot;Empire Magazine&quot; on a list of the 100 sexiest stars in film history. Novak was honored with a Golden Bear for Lifetime Achievement at the 47th Berlin International Film Festival in 1997 and was presented with the Eastman Kodak Archives Award for her major contribution to film in 2003. In 2012, Novak was honored in a handprint and footprint ceremony at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre. That same year, she received the &quot;S.F. Cinematic Icon Award&quot; from the San Francisco Museum and Historical Society for her screen contributions in San Francisco with &quot;Pal Joey&quot; and &quot;Vertigo&quot;. Her contribution to world cinema was also rewarded with the &quot;Kristián Award&quot; she was given at the 22nd Febiofest international film festival in 2015.

Novak influenced many actors, as well as fashion designers with the roles she played. Naomi Watts stated that her character interpretation in &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; (2001) was influenced by the look and performances of Novak in &quot;Vertigo&quot;. Renée Zellweger said that Novak was &quot;pure magic&quot; and dressed up as her character from &quot;Vertigo&quot; for a photo shoot for the March 2008 issue of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. Nicole Kidman wrote Novak a letter saying she was &quot;an inspiration to me and to women everywhere. Your cinematic body of work speaks for yourself, but so does the other side of Kim Novak – the free spirit who left Hollywood to live atop the hills of Big Sur. Kim Novak the painter and llama farmer. You are an icon whose screen presence is unmatched, and yet you&#x27;ve lived your life with dignity and authenticity, and the courage to follow your heart wherever it takes you.&quot; In 2005, British fashion designer Alexander McQueen named his first It Bag &quot;The Novak,&quot; saying, &quot;I&#x27;m drawn to Kim Novak in the same way that Hitchcock was. She had an air of uptightness you wouldn&#x27;t want to cross.&quot;

==Personal life==

In the mid-1950s, Novak had relationships with Ramfis Trujillo, son of Dominican dictator Rafael Leónidas Trujillo, and with Sammy Davis Jr. A BBC documentary claimed that to end her relationship with a black man, Columbia Pictures chief Harry Cohn had mobsters threaten Sammy Davis Jr., with blinding or having his legs broken if he did not marry a black woman within 48 hours. Novak also dated Michael Brandon, Wilt Chamberlain, David Hemmings, and Porfirio Rubirosa. She was engaged to director Richard Quine in 1959. Novak&#x27;s first marriage was to English actor Richard Johnson from March 15, 1965, to May 26, 1966. The two remained friends afterward.

In 1966, Novak left Hollywood for Big Sur, where she raised horses and painted, making an occasional film. In 1974, she met her second husband, equine veterinarian Robert Malloy, when he made a house call after one of her Arabian mares suffered colic. They married on March 12, 1976. As a result of her marriage, she has two adult stepchildren.
The couple built a log home along the Williamson River near Chiloquin, Oregon. Malloy died on November 27, 2020.

In 1997, Novak and Malloy bought a 43-acre ranch in Sams Valley, Oregon, which the couple made into their home. Novak took classes in painting with pastels from artists Harley Brown and Richard McKinley. In July 2000, their home burned to the ground, and she lost all her art and the only draft of the autobiography she had been working on for 10 years. In 2006, Novak was injured in a horse-riding accident. She suffered a punctured lung, broken ribs, and nerve damage, but made a full recovery within a year.

In October 2010, her manager, Sue Cameron, reported that Novak had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Cameron also noted that Novak was &quot;undergoing treatment&quot; and &quot;her doctors say she is in fantastic physical shape and should recover very well.&quot; She did recover well.
Robert Malloy&#x27;s ex-wife, Joan Gundlach—the mother of Novak&#x27;s stepchildren—died by suicide on April 23, 2013, aged 70. Local news at Post Falls, Idaho, where Gundlach&#x27;s body was found in the Spokane River, did not mention her celebrity connection.

In 2014, after Novak&#x27;s rare public appearance at the 86th Academy Awards, the media and social commentary indicated she was hardly recognized, which resulted in speculation that she had undertaken substantial cosmetic surgery; Donald Trump tweeted &quot;Kim should sue her plastic surgeon!&quot; Novak was devastated by the criticism—&quot;It really did throw me into a tailspin and it hit me hard,&quot; and wrote an open letter in which she stood up to all of her Oscar-night &quot;bullies&quot;. Novak admitted that she &quot;had fat injections in my face&quot; as she felt &quot;they seemed far less invasive than a face-lift,&quot; but later regretted it, &quot;So why did I do it? I trusted somebody doing what I thought they knew how to do best. I should have known better, but what do you do? We do some stupid things in our lives.&quot;

Novak continued her creative endeavors as a photographer, poet, and visual artist painting in watercolor, oil, and pastel. Her paintings are impressionistic and surrealistic. The Butler Institute of American Art in Youngstown, Ohio hosted a retrospective of her work from June until October 2019. Novak was present at the opening on June 16. In 2021, Butler&#x27;s also published a book with a selection of her paintings titled &quot;Kim Novak: Her Art and Life&quot;. More recent artworks were on exhibit from June through August 2024 at the Butler Institute. On June 6, 2024 she was, again, present at the opening of this exhibition.

<text>Triangle Metro Zoo (originally Zoo Fauna) was a privately owned and operated zoo that was open from 1998 until 2006. It was located in Wake Forest, North Carolina, United States.

==History==

The zoo originated from Larry Seibel&#x27;s long experience in breeding exotic animals, and was opened in 1998. It was situated in a heavily forested area astride a small stream. Its name derives from the area of North Carolina in which the zoo was located, which is called &quot;the Triangle&quot; because it comprises the three larger cities of Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill.

Shortly after the zoo opened in 1998, the barn containing the gift shop and restrooms burned down, and was never rebuilt. The owner cited lack of facilities at the zoo due to this fire, which prevented him from putting up a permanent sign on Capital Boulevard, as one of many factors that led to the lack of funds for the zoo and its eventual closure.

Seibel closed the zoo in February 2006, citing money and personal problems, as well as encroaching development that would require him to fence the entire property. After the zoo closed, the Bengal tiger Raja, who Seibel and staff had rescued from neglectful owners, was moved to the Carnivore Preservation Trust in Pittsboro, North Carolina after having first been quarantined at the North Carolina Zoo. Other animals were transferred to various private collections and zoos.

==Animals==

The zoo was home to some 500 animals representing 85 species. Mammals at the zoo included a Bengal tiger, blackbuck, Himalayan moon bears, camels, capybara, caracals, coati, donkeys, fallow deer, red kangaroos, lemurs, lions, llama, scimitar oryx, muntjac, sloths, servals, and zebras. Birds at the zoo included chickens, sarus cranes, red-crowned cranes, blue-and-gold macaws, scarlet macaws, military macaws, doves, emu, ostriches, pheasants, pigeons, toucans. Reptiles at the zoo included leopard geckos, bearded dragons, and various species of skinks and snakes.

<doc id="261266" wikidata="Q3576110" url="?curid=261266" title="Zorglub">
<text>Zorglub is a fictional character in the Belgian comic strip &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot;, created by Greg and André Franquin, and first appeared in the serialised story &quot;Z comme Zorglub&quot; in &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine in 1959, later published in the diptych albums &quot;Z comme Zorglub&quot; (1961) and &quot;L&#x27;ombre du Z&quot; (1962). Zorglub&#x27;s character was initially that of a sinister megalomaniac, mad scientist, but also a clumsy and bungling one who later reformed and became a friend and ally to the protagonists.

==Prior history==
He was a student in Brussels during his youth and became friends with the Count of Champignac and Miss Flanner. After a failed experiment to attract the moon maxed out all the university&#x27;s money, he not only became the laughing stock of the campus but was expelled as well.

==First meeting and evolution==
He reappears with the intent of starting an experiment on the moon, but he wants the association of his friend the Count, willingly or not. He has reformed entire villages into bases for his army made from hypnotized policemen, the zorglhommes. With them he manages to steal several military secrets and technology, including the zorglumobile. As the album progresses, he repents and starts dismantling his bases.

After dismantling all but one of his bases he is again sent on the evil path by Zantafio. When Zantafio betrays him by showing that all that he desires is power, Zorglub is shot and becomes catatonic. After the ordeal he reverts to the mental state of a child but with the help of the Count, Spirou and Fantasio he is cured and rehabilitated.

==Overall==
An impressive arch-villain, his initial appearance is that of a visionary evil genius, but the comical aspects of the character soon come through. Although possessing a great deal of advanced machinery, his only true invention (as he admits) is the &quot;zorglonde&quot; (zorglwave, a mind-control radio wave).

He boasts that he could, if he wanted to, take over the world, but considers it too petty for a man of his genius. His real aim is to be recognized as the greatest scientist of all time, but being eccentric, schizophrenic and with a big ego, he has a tendency to make foolish mistakes which lead to his downfall. He later rehabilitates, but his ego is never &quot;shot down&quot; which makes him an easy target to manipulate as evidenced in the album Tora Torapa.

In the latest album &quot;La Face cachée du Z&quot;, Zorglub has built a space base on the other side of the Moon... but that forced him to bow before investors and build them a lunapark. That makes him so mad he finally decides to be a villain again, this time in space, and (supposedly) far from humans.

Zorglub also had his own series of spinoff albums with his daughter, written and drawn by José Luis Munuera.

==Machinery and manpower==
His major invention is the &quot;Zorglonde&quot; which he uses to bring others under his spell. Depending on the wave level, the zorglonde can be used to temporarily hypnotise whole populations, prevent outsiders from approaching Zorglub&#x27;s bases or having an entire army under his control.
Zorglub uses the zorglonde to steal inventions developed by others which he then claims as his own. He also turns police officers from all over the world into his soldiers, known as Zorglhommes (Zorgl-men), who operate his worldwide secret bases. Zorglub designed a special language to talk with his zorglhommes in order to maintain the secrecy of his plans. It&#x27;s just normal speech spelled backwards: &quot;Gnol evil Bulgroz!&quot; translates as &quot;Long live Zorglub!&quot;

In &quot;Le réveil du Z&quot; (1986), Spirou and Fantasio travel through time and meet Zorglub&#x27;s son, who has followed into his father&#x27;s footsteps and conquered the world of the future. Zorglub junior looks exactly like his father, but he suffers from dwarfism. This however adds some irony, as he still refers to himself as &quot;The Great Zorglub&quot;.

<doc id="261268" wikidata="Q456794" url="?curid=261268" title="Rufus King">
<text>Rufus King (March 24, 1755April 29, 1827) was an American Founding Father, lawyer, politician, and diplomat. He was a delegate from Massachusetts to the Continental Congress and the Philadelphia Convention and was one of the signers of the United States Constitution in 1787. After formation of the new Congress, he represented New York in the United States Senate. He emerged as a leading member of the Federalist Party and was the party&#x27;s last presidential nominee during the 1816 presidential election.

The son of a prosperous Massachusetts merchant, King studied law before he volunteered for the militia during the American Revolutionary War. He won election to the Massachusetts General Court in 1783 and to the Congress of the Confederation the following year. At the 1787 Philadelphia Convention, he emerged as a leading nationalist and called for increased powers for the federal government. After the convention, King returned to Massachusetts, where he used his influence to help ratify the Constitution. At the urging of Alexander Hamilton, he then abandoned his law practice and moved to New York City.

He won election to represent New York in the United States Senate in 1789 and remained in office until 1796. That year, he accepted President George Washington&#x27;s appointment to the position of Minister to Great Britain. Though King aligned with Hamilton&#x27;s Federalist Party, the Democratic-Republican President Thomas Jefferson retained King&#x27;s services after Jefferson&#x27;s victory in the 1800 presidential election. King served as the Federalist vice-presidential candidate in the 1804 and 1808 elections and ran on an unsuccessful ticket with Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina. Though most Federalists supported the Democratic-Republican DeWitt Clinton in the 1812 presidential election, King, without the support of his party, won the few votes of the Federalists who were unwilling to support Clinton&#x27;s candidacy. In 1813, King returned to the Senate and remained in office until 1825.

King, the &quot;de facto&quot; Federalist nominee for president in 1816, lost in a landslide to James Monroe. The Federalist Party became defunct at the national level after 1816, and King was the last presidential nominee whom the party fielded. Nonetheless, King was able to remain in the Senate until 1825, which made him the last Federalist senator because of a split in the New York Democratic-Republican Party. King then accepted President John Quincy Adams&#x27;s appointment to serve another term as ambassador to Great Britain, but ill health forced King to retire from public life, and he died in 1827. King had five children who lived to adulthood, and he has had numerous notable descendants.

==Early life==
King was born on March 24, 1755, in Scarborough, which was then part of Massachusetts but is now in Maine. He was a son of Isabella (Bragdon) and Richard King, a prosperous farmer, merchant, lumberman, and sea captain who had settled at Dunstan Landing in Scarborough, near Portland, Maine, and had made a modest fortune by the time Rufus was born. His financial success aroused the jealousy of his neighbors, and when the unpopular Stamp Act 1765 was imposed, a mob ransacked his house and destroyed most of the furniture. Nobody was punished, and the next year, the mob burned down his barn. John Adams once referred to that moment in discussing limitations of the &quot;mob&quot; for the Constitutional Convention and wrote a letter to his wife, Abigail, in which he described the scene:

I am engaged in a famous Cause: The Cause of King, of Scarborough vs. a Mob, that broke into his House, and rifled his Papers, and terrifyed him, his Wife, Children and Servants in the Night. The Terror, and Distress, the Distraction and Horror of this Family cannot be described by Words or painted upon Canvass. It is enough to move a Statue, to melt an Heart of Stone, to read the Story...

Richard King was a Loyalist during the American Revolutionary War, but all his sons became Patriots.

==Education and early career==
King attended Dummer Academy (now The Governor&#x27;s Academy) at the age of twelve in South Byfield, Massachusetts. Later, he attended Harvard College, where he graduated in 1777. He began to read law under Theophilus Parsons, but his studies were interrupted in 1778, when King volunteered for militia duty during the American Revolutionary War. Appointed a major, he served as an aide to General John Sullivan during the Battle of Rhode Island. After the campaign, King returned to his apprenticeship under Parsons. He was admitted to the bar in 1780 and began a legal practice in Newburyport, Massachusetts.

==Political career==
===Constitutional Convention===
King was first elected to the Massachusetts General Court in 1783 and returned there yearly until 1785. Massachusetts sent him to the Confederation Congress from 1784 to 1787. He was one of the youngest men at the conference.

In 1787, King was sent to the Constitutional Convention, which was held in Philadelphia. Despite his youthful stature, King held a significant position at the convention since &quot;he numbered among the most capable orators.&quot; Along with James Madison, &quot;he became a leading figure in the nationalist causes.&quot; Furthermore, he attended every session. King&#x27;s major involvements included serving on the Committee on Postponed Matters and the Committee of Style and Arrangement.

Although when he came to the convention, he was still unconvinced that major changes should be made in the Articles of Confederation, his views underwent a startling transformation over the debates. He worked with Chairman William Samuel Johnson, James Madison, Gouverneur Morris, and Alexander Hamilton on the Committee of Style and Arrangement to prepare a final draft of the U.S. Constitution. King was one of the most prominent delegates namely because of playing &quot;a major role in the laborious crafting of the fundamental governing character.&quot; The Constitution was signed on September 17 but needed to be ratified by the states. After signing the Constitution, he returned home. He went to work to get the Constitution ratified and unsuccessfully positioned himself to be named to the U.S. Senate. The ratification passed by the narrow margin of 187–168. With the ratification passed, Massachusetts became the sixth state to ratify the constitution in early February 1788.

King was indirectly responsible for the passing of this ratification because his &quot;learned, informative, and persuasive speeches&quot; convinced a &quot;popular, vain merchant and prince-turned-politicians to abandon his anti-federalism and approve the new organic law.&quot;

===Later career===
After his early political experiences during the Constitutional Convention, King decided to switch his vocational calling by &quot;[abandoning] his law practice [in 1788], [and] moved from the Bay State to Gotham, and entered the New York political forum.&quot; At Hamilton&#x27;s urging, King moved to New York City and was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1789. Shortly afterwards, he was elected as Senator from New York and was re-elected in 1795. King declined an appointment as Secretary of State to succeed Edmund Randolph. In 1795, King helped Hamilton defend the controversial Jay Treaty by writing pieces for New York newspapers under the pseudonym &quot;Camillus.&quot; Of the 38 installments in the series, King wrote nine numbers 23–30, 34, and 35, in which he discussed the treaty&#x27;s maritime and commercial aspects. He was re-elected in 1795 but resigned on May 23, 1796, after he had been appointed U.S. Minister by George Washington to Great Britain. John Skey Eustace was angry at King, when he was ordered to leave the country and published an offensive pamphlet. Even though King was an outspoken Federalist politically, President Thomas Jefferson, upon his elevation to the presidency, refused to recall him. In 1803, King voluntarily relinquished his position.

King then returned to elected politics, for a long time with little success, but he later returned to the Senate. In April 1804, King ran unsuccessfully for the Senate from New York. Later that year and again in 1808, King and another signer of the Constitution, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, were candidates for vice president and president, respectively, fronting a Federalist Party in decline. Accordingly, they had no realistic chance against the Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson, and they received only 27.2% of the popular vote and lost by 45.6%, marking the highest recess in presidential election history. In 1808, both candidates were nominated again and lost against James Madison, gaining 32.4% of the popular vote.

In September 1812, the unpopular War of 1812 against Great Britain helped the opposing Federalists to regain their reputation, King led an effort at the Federalist Party caucus to nominate a ticket for the presidential election that year, but the effort failed, as the Democratic-Republican DeWitt Clinton had the best chances to defeat his fellow party member Madison, which made the Federalists field no candidate. However, some sought to make King the nominee to have a candidate under the Federalist banner on the ballot, and though little came of it, he finished third in the popular vote, with approximately 2% of the total. Shortly thereafter, King celebrated his first success after ten years by being elected to his &quot;second tenure on Senate&quot; in 1813.

In April 1816, he ran for governor of New York but lost to Daniel D. Tompkins. In the fall of that year, he became the informal presidential nominee for the Federalist Party, as it did not meet for any convention. He received only 30.9% of the popular vote and lost again, this time to James Monroe, whose running mate, coincidentally, was Tompkins. King was the last presidential candidate by the Federalists before their collapse.

When he ran for re-election to the Senate in 1819, he ran as a Federalist even though the party was already disbanding and had only a small minority in the New York State Legislature. However, because of the split of the Democratic-Republicans, no successor was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1819, and the seat remained vacant until January 1820. Trying to attract the former Federalist voters to their side at the next gubernatorial election in April 1820, both factions of the Democratic-Republican Party supported King, who served another term in the U.S. Senate until March 3, 1825. The Federalist Party had already ceased to exist on the federal stage. During King&#x27;s second tenure in the Senate, he continued his career as an opponent of slavery, which he denounced as anathema to the principles underlying the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. In what is considered the greatest speech of his career, he spoke against admitting Missouri as a slave state in 1820.

==Diplomat==
King played a major diplomatic role as minister to the Court of St James&#x27;s from 1796 to 1803 and again from 1825 to 1826. Although he was a leading Federalist, Thomas Jefferson kept him in office until King asked to be relieved. Some prominent accomplishments that King had from his time as a national diplomat include a term of friendly relations with Great Britain and the United States, at least until it became hostile in 1805. With that in mind, he successfully reached a compromise on the passing of the Jay Treaty and was an avid supporter of it.

King was outspoken against potential Irish immigration to the United States in the wake of the Irish Rebellion of 1798. In a September 13, 1798, letter to the Duke of Portland, King said of potential Irish refugees, &quot;I certainly do not think they will be a desirable acquisition to any Nation, but in none would they be likely to prove more mischievous than in mine, where from the sameness of language and similarity of Laws and Institutions they have greater opportunities of propagating their principles than in any other Country.&quot; Also, while in Britain, King was in close personal contact with the South American revolutionary Francisco de Miranda and facilitated Miranda&#x27;s trip to the United States in search of support for his failed 1806 expedition to Venezuela.

Soon after his second term in the Senate ended, King was appointed minister to Great Britain again, this time by U.S. President John Quincy Adams. However, he was forced to return home a few months later because of his failing health. He then retired from public life. Adams initially offered the role to New York Governor DeWitt Clinton.

==Anti-slavery activity==

Though King had been a slaveholder as a young man, he became a prominent opponent of slavery.
King had a long history of opposition to the expansion of slavery and the slave trade. That stand was a product of moral conviction, which coincided with the political realities of New England Federalists. While in Congress, he successfully added provisions to the 1787 Northwest Ordinance that barred the extension of slavery into the Northwest Territory. However, he also said he was willing &quot;to suffer the continuance of slaves until they can be gradually emancipated in states already overrun with them.&quot; He referred to slavery as a &quot;nefarious institution.&quot; In 1817, he supported Senate action to abolish the domestic slave trade, and in 1819, he spoke strongly for the anti-slavery amendment to the Missouri statehood bill. In 1819, his arguments were political, economic, and humanitarian. The extension of slavery would adversely affect the security of the principles of freedom and liberty. After the Missouri Compromise, he continued to support gradual emancipation in various ways. In 1821, he fought against attempts to include a discriminatory clause in New York&#x27;s Constitution that aimed to restrict suffrage on racial grounds, arguing that such a restriction was unconstitutional.

==Library==

At the time of his death in 1827, King had a library of roughly 2,200 titles in 3,500 volumes. In addition, King had roughly 200 bound volumes containing thousands of pamphlets. King&#x27;s son John Alsop King inherited the library and kept it in Jamaica, Queens, until his death in 1867. The books then went to John&#x27;s son, Dr. Charles Ray King, of Bucks County, Pennsylvania. They remained in Pennsylvania until they were donated to the New-York Historical Society in 1906, where most of them currently reside. Some books have extensive marginalia. In addition, six commonplace books survive in his papers at the New York Historical Society.

==Other accomplishments==
In his lifetime, King was an avid supporter of Alexander Hamilton and his fiscal programs and became a director of the Hamilton-sponsored First Bank of the United States. Among other prominent things that occurred in his life, King was first elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1805 and was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814. Contrary to his previous position on the national bank of the United States, King found himself denying the reopening of a Second Bank of the United States in 1816. In 1822, he was admitted as an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati.

==Family==

Many of King&#x27;s family were also involved in politics, and he had numerous prominent descendants. His brother William King was the first governor of Maine and a prominent merchant, and his other brother, Cyrus King, was a U.S. Representative from Massachusetts.

His wife, Mary Alsop, was born in New York on October 17, 1769, and died in Jamaica, New York, on June 5, 1819. She was the only daughter of John Alsop, a wealthy merchant and a delegate for New York to the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1776. She was a great-niece of Governor John Winthrop of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. She married King in New York City on March 30, 1786.

Mary King was a lady of remarkable beauty, gentle and gracious manners, and well cultivated mind, and adorned the high station, both in England and at home, that her husband&#x27;s official positions and their own social relations entitled them to occupy. A King family member once wrote to their wife of her beauty and personality: &quot;Tell Betsy King [Rufus&#x27;s half-sister] her sister is a beauty. She is vastly the best looking woman I have seen since I have been in this city... She is a good hearted woman, and, I think, possesses all that Benevolence and kind, friendly disposition, that never fail to find respectable admirers.&quot; Her &quot;remarkable beauty&quot; and &quot;well cultivated manner&quot; seemed to help the Kings in the type of lifestyle in which they lived, one in which the Kings found themselves in &quot;fashionable circles and entertained frequently... (potentially helped by how &quot;[Mrs. King] was widely admired in New York society; her retiring nature set her apart.&quot;). The Kings had seven children, of which five managed to live to adulthood. On June 5, 1819, Mrs. King died. &quot;She was buried in the old churchyard of Grace Church.&quot; Rufus King remarked on her death regarding his wife, &quot;The example of her life is worthy of the imitation of us all.&quot;

Rufus King died on April 29, 1827, and his funeral was held at his New York home in Jamaica, Queens. He is buried in the Grace Church Cemetery, in Jamaica, Queens. The home that King purchased in 1805 and expanded thereafter and some of his farm make up King Park in Queens. The home, called King Manor, is now a museum open to the public. The Rufus King School, also known as P.S. 26, in Fresh Meadows, New York, was named after King, as was the Rufus King Hall on the City University of New York Queens College campus and King Street in Madison, Wisconsin.

<text>Tekserve was an American consumer electronics and information technology consulting business based in the Flatiron District of Manhattan, New York City. Founded in 1987 as a side business by Macintosh-using engineers designing computer-controlled institutional electronics, Tekserve grew from a small back-office Macintosh repair shop to become the largest single-location Apple Specialist and Premium Service Provider in the United States.

The store announced its closure on August 15, 2016, and the location subsequently became home to the Poster House museum.

==History==
Tekserve founders David Lerner and Dick Demenus met at the New York City public FM radio station WBAI in 1970, and with engineer Mike Edl set up shop together late in the decade under the name Current Designs Corporation. Their business was electronic engineering and industrial design. They manufactured the indestructible music listening stations to be found at the Lincoln Center branch of the New York Public Library, and early models of the audio listening tours now found in many art museums.

Tekserve was formed as a &quot;sister company under the same roof&quot; dedicated to servicing Macintosh computers and became Apple-authorized for repair in 1993. Tekserve occupied four locations on the same side of the same block in Chelsea: a loft at 115 West 23rd Street; another loft at 163 West 23rd Street (the &quot;Traffic Building&quot;); a larger space on the fourth floor of 155 West 23rd Street, and later expansions to the third floor. In June 2002, the company moved to a storefront location at 119 West 23rd Street, occupying the entire first floor of the Printing Arts Building (which extends through to 24th street). The first three locations were notable for their eccentric decor, including an antique ten-cent Coke machine, and a porch swing.

In 2014, Tekserve birthed a business-to-business enterprise, T2 Computing, based on core competencies and experiences, which continues to operate. T2 became part of Axispoint in 2017, the latter acquiring the right to the Tekserve brand name.

On June 29, 2016, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported the retail store and service center would close, while certain elements of the business remained open. It ultimately closed a few weeks before the end of its lease due to changes in shopping habits, the presence of multiple Apple stores and increased rent.

==In popular culture==
* Several television series, including &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, have utilized Tekserve&#x27;s facilities as a shooting location.
* In &quot;Sex and the City&quot; episode 408, &quot;My Motherboard, Myself,&quot; Aasif Mandvi was featured as a Tekserve employee attempting to recover data from Carrie Bradshaw&#x27;s portable computer at the smaller 155 West 23rd Street location.
* &quot;LaserWriter II&quot;, a novel by Tamara Shopsin, is about a 19-year-old girl who gets a job at Tekserve. The book introduces many different employees and offers a semi-fictional peek into the daily life of a printer technician at Tekserve.
* &quot;American Pickers&quot; visited the store shortly before closing and purchased some items from the owner&#x27;s personal collection. Other pieces from the store&#x27;s &quot;Mac Museum&quot; ultimately ended up in a museum in Kyiv, Ukraine operated by MacPaw.

<doc id="261272" wikidata="Q3080148" url="?curid=261272" title="The Method of Mechanical Theorems">
<text>The Method of Mechanical Theorems (), also referred to as The Method, is one of the major surviving works of the ancient Greek polymath Archimedes. &quot;The Method&quot; takes the form of a letter from Archimedes to Eratosthenes, the chief librarian at the Library of Alexandria, and contains the first attested explicit use of indivisibles (indivisibles are geometric versions of infinitesimals). The work was originally thought to be lost, but in 1906 was rediscovered in the celebrated Archimedes Palimpsest. The palimpsest includes Archimedes&#x27; account of the &quot;mechanical method&quot;, so called because it relies on the center of weights of figures (centroid) and the law of the lever, which were demonstrated by Archimedes in &quot;On the Equilibrium of Planes&quot;.

Archimedes did not admit the method of indivisibles as part of rigorous mathematics, and therefore did not publish his method in the formal treatises that contain the results. In these treatises, he proves the same theorems by exhaustion, finding rigorous upper and lower bounds which both converge to the answer required. Nevertheless, the mechanical method was what he used to discover the relations for which he later gave rigorous proofs.

==Area of a parabola==

Archimedes&#x27; idea is to use the law of the lever to determine the areas of figures from the known center of mass of other figures. The simplest example in modern language is the area of the parabola. A modern approach would be to find this area by calculating the integral

formula_1

which is an elementary result in integral calculus. Instead, the Archimedean method mechanically balances the parabola (the curved region being integrated above) with a certain triangle that is made of the same material. The parabola is the region in the formula_2 plane between the formula_3-axis and the curve formula_4 as formula_3 varies from 0 to 1. The triangle is the region in the same plane between the formula_3-axis and the line formula_7, also as formula_3 varies from 0 to 1.

Slice the parabola and triangle into vertical slices, one for each value of formula_3. Imagine that the formula_3-axis is a lever, with a fulcrum at formula_11. The law of the lever states that two objects on opposite sides of the fulcrum will balance if each has the same torque, where an object&#x27;s torque equals its weight times its distance to the fulcrum. For each value of formula_3, the slice of the triangle at position formula_3 has a mass equal to its height formula_3, and is at a distance formula_3 from the fulcrum; so it would balance the corresponding slice of the parabola, of height formula_16, if the latter were moved to formula_17, at a distance of 1 on the other side of the fulcrum.

Since each pair of slices balances, moving the whole parabola to formula_17 would balance the whole triangle. This means that if the original uncut parabola is hung by a hook from the point formula_17 (so that the whole mass of the parabola is attached to that point), it will balance the triangle sitting between formula_11 and formula_21.

The center of mass of a triangle can be easily found by the following method, also due to Archimedes. If a median line is drawn from any one of the vertices of a triangle to the opposite edge formula_22, the triangle will balance on the median, considered as a fulcrum. The reason is that if the triangle is divided into infinitesimal line segments parallel to formula_22, each segment has equal length on opposite sides of the median, so balance follows by symmetry. This argument can be easily made rigorous by exhaustion by using little rectangles instead of infinitesimal lines, and this is what Archimedes does in &quot;On the Equilibrium of Planes&quot;.

So the center of mass of a triangle must be at the intersection point of the medians. For the triangle in question, one median is the line formula_24, while a second median is the line formula_25. Solving these equations, we see that the intersection of these two medians is above the point formula_26, so that the total effect of the triangle on the lever is as if the total mass of the triangle were pushing down on (or hanging from) this point. The total torque exerted by the triangle is its area, 1/2, times the distance 2/3 of its center of mass from the fulcrum at formula_11. This torque of 1/3 balances the parabola, which is at a distance 1 from the fulcrum. Hence, the area of the parabola must be 1/3 to give it the opposite torque.

This type of method can be used to find the area of an arbitrary section of a parabola, and similar arguments can be used to find the integral of any power of formula_3, although higher powers become complicated without algebra. Archimedes only went as far as the integral of formula_29, which he used to find the center of mass of a hemisphere, and in other work, the center of mass of a parabola.

==First proposition in the palimpsest==

Consider the parabola in the figure to the right. Pick two points on the parabola and call them &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;.

Suppose the line segment &quot;AC&quot; is parallel to the axis of symmetry of the parabola. Further suppose that the line segment &quot;BC&quot; lies on a line that is tangent to the parabola at &quot;B&quot;.
The first proposition states:

:The area of the triangle &quot;ABC&quot; is exactly three times the area bounded by the parabola and the secant line &quot;AB&quot;.

:&quot;Proof&quot;:
Let &quot;D&quot; be the midpoint of &quot;AC&quot;. Construct a line segment &quot;JB&quot; through &quot;D&quot;, where the distance from &quot;J&quot; to &quot;D&quot; is equal to the distance from &quot;B&quot; to &quot;D&quot;. We will think of the segment &quot;JB&quot; as a &quot;lever&quot; with &quot;D&quot; as its fulcrum. As Archimedes had previously shown, the center of mass of the triangle is at the point &quot;I&quot; on the &quot;lever&quot; where &quot;DI&quot; :&quot;DB&quot; = 1:3. Therefore, it suffices to show that if the whole weight of the interior of the triangle rests at &quot;I&quot;, and the whole weight of the section of the parabola at &quot;J&quot;, the lever is in equilibrium.

Consider an infinitely small cross-section of the triangle given by the segment &quot;HE&quot;, where the point &quot;H&quot; lies on &quot;BC&quot;, the point &quot;E&quot; lies on &quot;AB&quot;, and &quot;HE&quot; is parallel to the axis of symmetry of the parabola. Call the intersection of &quot;HE&quot; and the parabola &quot;F&quot; and the intersection of &quot;HE&quot; and the lever &quot;G&quot;. If the weight of all such segments &quot;HE&quot; rest at the points &quot;G&quot; where they intersect the lever, then they exert the same torque on the lever as does the whole weight of the triangle resting at &quot;I&quot;. Thus, we wish to show that if the weight of the cross-section &quot;HE&quot; rests at &quot;G&quot; and the weight of the cross-section &quot;EF&quot; of the section of the parabola rests at &quot;J&quot;, then the lever is in equilibrium. In other words, it suffices to show that &quot;EF&quot; :&quot;GD&quot; = &quot;EH&quot; :&quot;JD&quot;. But that is a routine consequence of the equation of the parabola. Q.E.D.

== Volume of a sphere ==

Again, to illuminate the mechanical method, it is convenient to use a little bit of coordinate geometry. If a sphere of radius 1 is placed with its center at &quot;x&quot; = 1, the vertical cross sectional radius formula_30 at any &quot;x&quot; between 0 and 2 is given by the following formula:
formula_31

The mass of this cross section, for purposes of balancing on a lever, is proportional to the area:

formula_32

Archimedes then considered rotating the triangular region between &quot;y&quot; = 0 and &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot; and &quot;x&quot; = 2 on the &quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot; plane around the &quot;x&quot;-axis, to form a cone. The cross section of this cone is a circle of radius formula_33

formula_34

and the area of this cross section is

formula_35

So if slices of the cone and the sphere &quot;both&quot; are to be weighed together, the combined cross-sectional area is:

formula_36

If the two slices are placed together at distance 1 from the fulcrum, their total weight would be exactly balanced by a circle of area formula_37 at a distance &quot;x&quot; from the fulcrum on the other side. This means that the cone and the sphere together, if all their material were moved to &quot;x&quot; = 1, would balance a cylinder of base radius 1 and length 2 on the other side.

As &quot;x&quot; ranges from 0 to 2, the cylinder will have a center of gravity a distance 1 from the fulcrum, so all the weight of the cylinder can be considered to be at position 1. The condition of balance ensures that the volume of the cone plus the volume of the sphere is equal to the volume of the cylinder.

The volume of the cylinder is the cross section area, formula_37 times the height, which is 2, or formula_39. Archimedes could also find the volume of the cone using the mechanical method, since, in modern terms, the integral involved is exactly the same as the one for area of the parabola. The volume of the cone is 1/3 its base area times the height. The base of the cone is a circle of radius 2, with area formula_39, while the height is 2, so the area is formula_41. Subtracting the volume of the cone from the volume of the cylinder gives the volume of the sphere:

formula_42

The dependence of the volume of the sphere on the radius is obvious from scaling, although that also was not trivial to make rigorous back then. The method then gives the familiar formula for the volume of a sphere. By scaling the dimensions linearly Archimedes easily extended the volume result to spheroids.

Archimedes argument is nearly identical to the argument above, but his cylinder had a bigger radius, so that the cone and the cylinder hung at a greater distance from the fulcrum. He considered this argument to be his greatest achievement, requesting that the accompanying figure of the balanced sphere, cone, and cylinder be engraved upon his tombstone.

== Surface area of a sphere ==

To find the surface area of the sphere, Archimedes argued that just as the area of the circle could be thought of as infinitely many infinitesimal right triangles going around the circumference (see &quot;Measurement of the Circle&quot;), the volume of the sphere could be thought of as divided into many cones with height equal to the radius and base on the surface. The cones all have the same height, so their volume is 1/3 the base area times the height.

Archimedes states that the total volume of the sphere is equal to the volume of a cone whose base has the same surface area as the sphere and whose height is the radius. There are no details given for the argument, but the obvious reason is that the cone can be divided into infinitesimal cones by splitting the base area up, and then each cone makes a contribution according to its base area, just the same as in the sphere.

Let the surface of the sphere be &quot;S&quot;. The volume of the cone with base area &quot;S&quot; and height &quot;r&quot; is formula_43, which must equal the volume of the sphere: formula_44. Therefore, the surface area of the sphere must be formula_45, or &quot;four times its largest circle&quot;. Archimedes proves this rigorously in &quot;On the Sphere and Cylinder&quot;.

== Curvilinear shapes with rational volumes ==

One of the remarkable things about the &quot;Method&quot; is that Archimedes finds two shapes defined by sections of cylinders, whose volume does not involve formula_46, despite the shapes having curvilinear boundaries. This is a central point of the investigation—certain curvilinear shapes could be rectified by ruler and compass, so that there are nontrivial rational relations between the volumes defined by the intersections of geometrical solids.

Archimedes emphasizes this in the beginning of the treatise, and invites the reader to try to reproduce the results by some other method. Unlike the other examples, the volume of these shapes is not rigorously computed in any of his other works. From fragments in the palimpsest, it appears that Archimedes did inscribe and circumscribe shapes to prove rigorous bounds for the volume, although the details have not been preserved.

The two shapes he considers are the intersection of two cylinders at right angles (the bicylinder), which is the region of (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) obeying:
formula_47
and the circular prism, which is the region obeying:
formula_48
Both problems have a slicing which produces an easy integral for the mechanical method. For the circular prism, cut up the &quot;x&quot;-axis into slices. The region in the &quot;y&quot;-&quot;z&quot; plane at any &quot;x&quot; is the interior of a right triangle of side length formula_49 whose area is formula_50, so that the total volume is:
formula_51
which can be easily rectified using the mechanical method. Adding to each triangular section a section of a triangular pyramid with area formula_52 balances a prism whose cross section is constant.

For the intersection of two cylinders, the slicing is lost in the manuscript, but it can be reconstructed in an obvious way in parallel to the rest of the document: if the x-z plane is the slice direction, the equations for the cylinder give that formula_53 while formula_54, which defines a region which is a square in the &quot;x&quot;-&quot;z&quot; plane of side length formula_55, so that the total volume is:
formula_56
And this is the same integral as for the previous example. Jan Hogendijk argues that, besides the volume of the bicylinder, Archimedes knew its surface area, which is also rational.

==Other propositions in the palimpsest==

A series of propositions of geometry are proved in the palimpsest by similar arguments. One theorem is that the location of a center of mass of a is located 5/8 of the way from the pole to the center of the sphere. This problem is notable, because it is evaluating a cubic integral.

<doc id="261273" wikidata="Q41228" url="?curid=261273" title="Southern Hemisphere">
<text>The Southern Hemisphere is the half (hemisphere) of Earth that is south of the equator. It contains all or parts of five continents (the whole of Antarctica, the whole of Australia, about 90% of South America, about one-third of Africa, and some islands off the continental mainland of Asia) and four oceans (the whole Southern Ocean, the majority of the Indian Ocean, the South Atlantic Ocean, and the South Pacific Ocean), as well as New Zealand and most of the Pacific Islands in Oceania. Its surface is 80.9% water, compared with 60.7% water in the Northern Hemisphere, and it contains 32.7% of Earth&#x27;s land.

Owing to the tilt of Earth&#x27;s rotation relative to the Sun and the ecliptic plane, summer is from December to February (inclusive) and winter is from June to August (inclusive). September 22 or 23 is the vernal equinox and March 20 or 21 is the autumnal equinox. The South Pole is in the centre of the southern hemispherical region.

== Characteristics ==
Southern Hemisphere climates tend to be slightly milder than those at similar latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, except in the Antarctic which is colder than the Arctic. This is because the Southern Hemisphere has significantly more ocean and much less land; water heats up and cools down more slowly than land. The differences are also attributed to oceanic heat transfer and differing extents of greenhouse trapping.

In the Southern Hemisphere, the Sun passes from east to west through the north, although north of the Tropic of Capricorn the mean Sun can be directly overhead or due south at midday. The Sun follows a right-to-left trajectory through the northern sky unlike the left-to-right motion of the Sun when seen from the Northern Hemisphere as it passes through the southern sky. Sun-cast shadows turn anticlockwise throughout the day and sundials have the hours increasing in the anticlockwise direction. During solar eclipses viewed from a point to the south of the Tropic of Capricorn, the Moon moves from left to right on the disc of the Sun (see, for example, photos with timings of the solar eclipse of November 13, 2012), while viewed from a point to the north of the Tropic of Cancer (i.e., in the Northern Hemisphere), the Moon moves from right to left during solar eclipses.

The Coriolis effect causes cyclones and tropical storms to spin clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere, as opposed to anticlockwise in the Northern Hemisphere.

The southern temperate zone, a subsection of the Southern Hemisphere, is nearly all oceanic.

The Sagittarius constellation that includes the galactic centre is a southern constellation as well as both Magellanic Clouds. This, combined with clearer skies, makes for excellent viewing of the night sky from the Southern Hemisphere with brighter and more numerous stars.

Forests in the Southern Hemisphere have special features which set them apart from those in the Northern Hemisphere. Both Chile and Australia share, for example, unique beech species or &quot;Nothofagus&quot;, and New Zealand has members of the closely related genera &quot;Lophozonia&quot; and &quot;Fuscospora&quot;. The eucalyptus is native to Australia but is now also planted in Southern Africa and Latin America for pulp production, and increasingly, biofuel uses.

One of the most notable animals to be found almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere is the penguin. A species is found around Isabela Island on the Galápagos archipelago in the Pacific Ocean, which straddles the equator. However, most of Isabela and the rest of the archipelago is located in the Southern Hemisphere, and it is deemed by the International Hydrographic Organization as being wholly within the South Pacific Ocean, rather than the North Pacific.

== Demographics and human geography ==
More than 850 million people live in the Southern Hemisphere, representing around 10–12% of the total global human population. Of those 850 million people, more than 203 million live in Brazil, the largest country by land area in the Southern Hemisphere, while more than 150 million live in Java, the most populous island in the world. The most populous country in the Southern Hemisphere is Indonesia, with 275 million people (roughly 30 million of whom live north of the Equator on the northern portions of the islands of Sumatra, Borneo, and Sulawesi, as well as most of North Maluku, while the rest of the population lives in the Southern Hemisphere). Portuguese is the most spoken language in the Southern Hemisphere, with over 230 million speakers in six countries – mostly in Brazil, but also in Angola, Mozambique, East Timor, and small parts of Equatorial Guinea and São Tomé and Príncipe that lie south of the Equator.

Among the largest metropolitan areas in the Southern Hemisphere are Jakarta (33 million people), São Paulo (22 million), Kinshasa-Brazzaville (19 million), Buenos Aires (16 million), Rio de Janeiro (12 million), Lima (11 million), Surabaya (10 million), Luanda, Bandung (9 million each), Dar es Salaam, Santiago (7 million each), Johannesburg, Semarang, Belo Horizonte (6 million each), Sydney, Melbourne and Cape Town (5 million each). Important financial and commercial centres in the Southern Hemisphere include São Paulo, where the B3 (stock exchange) is headquartered, along with Sydney, home to the Australian Securities Exchange, Jakarta, the seat of the Indonesia Stock Exchange, Johannesburg, home to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, and Buenos Aires, headquarters of the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange, the oldest stock market in the Southern Hemisphere.

Common tourist destinations in the Southern Hemisphere include Bali, Buenos Aires, Cape Town, Easter Island, Lima, Rio de Janeiro, Sydney and Tahiti. According to a 2017 report, the most popular Southern Hemisphere &quot;bucket list&quot; destinations among Australians were Antarctica, New Zealand, the Galápagos Islands, South Africa and Peru.

Quito, Ecuador is the closest major city to the equatorial line on the planet, and Ushuaia, Argentina claims the title of world&#x27;s southernmost city. Cape Town, Christchurch, Hobart, Punta Arenas and Ushuaia are officially acknowledged as the five international Antarctic gateway cities that serve as primary entry points for travel to the Antarctic region.

Among the most developed nations in the Southern Hemisphere is Australia, with a nominal GDP per capita of US$63,487 and a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.946, the tenth-highest in the world as of the 2024 report. New Zealand is also well developed, with a nominal GDP per capita of US$48,072 and an HDI of 0.939, putting it at number 16 in the world in 2024. The least developed nations in the Southern Hemisphere cluster in Africa and Oceania, with Mozambique and Burundi at the lowest ends of the HDI, at 0.461 (number 183 in the world) and 0.420 (number 187 in the world), respectively. The nominal GDPs per capita of these two countries do not go above US$650, a tiny fraction of the incomes enjoyed by Australians and New Zealanders.

The Southern Hemisphere has long been secondary in the global distribution of demographic, economic and political power, as it has less land than the Northern Hemisphere. In recent times, however, countries such as Australia have made greater efforts to economically engage with those from their hemisphere. Before the Age of Discovery, the Southern Hemisphere was largely cut off from the cultural constructs of the Western and Eastern worlds. Some view both the West and the East as being Northern Hemisphere-centric concepts.

The most widespread religions in the modern Southern Hemisphere are Christianity, prevalent in South America, Africa, Oceania, and East Timor, followed by Islam in East Africa and Indonesia, and Hinduism, which is mostly concentrated on/around the islands of Bali, Mauritius, and Fiji.

The oldest continuously inhabited city in the Southern Hemisphere is Bogor, in western Java, which was founded in 669. Ancient texts from the Hindu kingdoms prevalent in the area definitively record 669 CE as the year when Bogor was founded. However, some evidence shows that Zanzibar, an ancient port with around 200,000 inhabitants off the coast of Tanzania, may be older than Bogor. A Greco-Roman text written between 1 and 100 CE, the &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot;, mentioned the island of &quot;Menuthias&quot; (Ancient Greek: Μενουθιάς) as a trading port on the east African coast, which is probably the small Tanzanian island of Unguja on which Zanzibar is located. The oldest monumental civilizations in the Southern Hemisphere are the Norte Chico civilization and Casma–Sechin culture from the northern coast of Peru. These civilizations built cities, pyramids, and plazas in the coastal river valleys of northern Peru with some ruins dating back to 3600 BCE. Easter Island, located about 3,500 kilometres from Chile and French Polynesia, is considered to be the most remote place on Earth to have been permanently inhabited by humans before the Age of Discovery. It was settled by a Polynesian group known as the Rapa Nui. Areas of the Southern Hemisphere that had no contact with humans before the Age of Discovery include Christmas Island and Mauritius (in the Indian Ocean), the Galápagos Islands, Juan Fernández Islands and Lord Howe Island (in the South Pacific), the Falkland Islands and Tristan da Cunha (in the South Atlantic) and the continent of Antarctica.

<text>Charles Radcliffe (7 December 1941 – 10 July 2021) was an English cultural critic, political activist and theorist known for his association with the Situationist movement.

==Life==
A member of the direct-action wing of the peace movement of the early 1960s, he became a regular contributor to the anarchist press in Britain and in 1966 launched &quot;Heatwave&quot;, a radical magazine produced in London. It lasted for just two issues, but was cited in the Situationist tract &quot;On the Poverty of Student Life&quot; as an example of one of the &quot;profoundly revolutionary tendencies in the critique of all aspects of the prevailing way of life.&quot; Its treatment of popular culture has since been hailed as path-breaking: the critic Jon Savage has said that one piece by Radcliffe &quot;laid the foundation for the next 20 years of sub-cultural theory.&quot;

&quot;Heatwave&quot; was closely associated with &quot;Rebel Worker&quot;, a short-lived but influential magazine published in Chicago by Franklin Rosemont, Penelope Rosemont, and Bernard Marszalek, to which Radcliffe was a contributor. They were members of the Industrial Workers of the World with links to the Surrealist movement in France, the British libertarian socialist group Solidarity and the Situationist International.

Radcliffe became a member of the English section of the S.I. in December 1966, alongside Chris Gray (situationist), Donald Nicholson-Smith and T. J. Clark. He resigned in November 1967, and Gray, Nicholson-Smith and Clark were expelled shortly thereafter.

Between early 1970 and summer 1972 Radcliffe was involved with the magazine &quot;Friends&quot;, sharing a flat with its editor, Alan Marcuson.

Radcliffe is a descendant of Moll Davis.

<text>Benjamin Franklin Cummings Institute of Technology (Franklin Cummings Tech) is a private college of engineering and industrial technologies in Boston, Massachusetts. It was established in 1908 with funds bequeathed in Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s will.

==History==

Benjamin Franklin Cummings Institute of Technology owes its existence to the vision of Benjamin Franklin. In a codicil to his will, dated 1789, Franklin established a 200-year plan for £1,000 (about $4,400 at the time, or about $112,000 in 2010 dollars) that he gave to the city of Boston, where he was born. For the first hundred years, the money was to serve as principal for loans to young workmen; at the end of that period, the fund&#x27;s managers would divide the money, using approximately three-fourths for public works and maintaining the rest as a loan fund.

When the hundred-year interval had passed, Boston decided to use the money to establish a technical school. Aided by an additional gift from industrialist Andrew Carnegie and land donated by the city, the institute opened its doors in 1908. A series of murals on campus were painted by Charles Mills.

In 2019, the institute announced plans to sell its three-building 1908 campus and look for a 30% larger facility. In September 2019, the institute announced a move to a new campus located on seven-tenths of an acre in the Dudley Square section of Roxbury (now renamed Nubian Square) to be closer to the neighborhoods where many of its students lived. The new building is expected to open in the autumn of 2024.

In September 2020, the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; leaked that the institute was planning for a possible merger with the Wentworth Institute of Technology. The merger deal faced opposition among community members and city officials based on how the merger would affect Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s ability to continue to serve low-income minority students, as well as the secretive nature of the merger negotiations themselves. In November 2020, the college&#x27;s board of trustees voted to keep Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology independent and to discontinue any merger talks.

In February 2022, the college announced it received a $12.5 million gift from the Cummings Foundation to advance its work in creating technical career pathways for students typically underrepresented in post-secondary education. In recognition of the transformational nature of the commitment—nearly equivalent to the school&#x27;s annual operating budget—the college was renamed Benjamin Franklin Cummings Institute of Technology.

==Academics==
, the college served approximately 870 students (61% in traditional programs and 39% through strategic partnerships and continuing education programs), with a 9:1 student-to-faculty ratio, and offered programs of study awarding certificates, associate degrees, and bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

The college is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE).

<doc id="261285" wikidata="Q221110" url="?curid=261285" title="Arthur Hastings">
<text>Captain Arthur J. M. Hastings, OBE, is a fictional character created by Agatha Christie as the companion-chronicler and best friend of the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. He is first introduced in Christie&#x27;s 1920 novel &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot; (originally written in 1916) and appears as a character in seven other Poirot novels, including the final one &quot;Curtain: Poirot&#x27;s Last Case&quot; (1975), along with a play and many short stories. He is also the narrator of several of them.

==Literary function==
Hastings is today strongly associated with Poirot, due more to the television adaptations than to the novels. Many of the early TV episodes of &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; were adaptations of short stories, in most of which he appeared in print. A few were stories into which he had been adapted (for example, &quot;Murder in the Mews&quot;). In Christie&#x27;s original writings, Hastings is not in every short story or novel. He is not a character in either &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; or &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;, the two best-known Poirot novels. Of the twenty-two Poirot novels published between 1920 and 1937, he appears in seven. When Christie expanded &quot;The Submarine Plans&quot; (1923) as &quot;The Incredible Theft&quot; (1937), she removed Hastings.

Hastings appears to have been introduced by Christie in accordance with the model of Sherlock Holmes&#x27;s associate, Doctor Watson, to whom he bears a marked resemblance. Both narrate in the first person, both are slow to see the significance of clues, and both stand as a form of surrogate for the reader. There are even similarities of role: Hastings is Poirot&#x27;s only close friend and the two share a flat briefly when Poirot sets up his detective agency. Similarly to Watson, Hastings also has a penchant for speculation and gambling, as well as a military background in the colonial Middle East. The presence of Chief Inspector Japp, a close &quot;literary descendant&quot; of Holmes&#x27;s Inspector Lestrade, fleshed out Christie&#x27;s adoption of the Holmes paradigm.

In the novels, Hastings&#x27;s literary function changes with Poirot&#x27;s method. In the earlier phase of his career, Hastings is valued for his imaginative approach to cases, inevitably giving rise to fanciful hypotheses that Poirot gently mocks. Poirot himself characterised Hastings thus in &quot;The Mystery of the Spanish Chest&quot; (1932): &quot;How my dear friend, Hastings, would have enjoyed this! What romantic flights of imagination he would have had. What ineptitudes he would have uttered! Ah &quot;ce cher&quot; Hastings, at this moment, today, I miss him...&quot; Later in her career, Christie&#x27;s apparatus is less fanciful and the opportunity for wild speculation much diminished. When the need for a sidekick arises in the later novels and stories it is either as:
* a suspect;
* Miss Lemon, who, in direct contrast with Hastings, is completely unimaginative;
* Mr Satterthwaite: a great observer of human nature who avoids passing judgments;
* Ariadne Oliver: a crime novelist who opened to Christie the opportunity for self-satire.

Although Hastings remains the most popular of Poirot&#x27;s sidekicks, his appearance in only eight of the thirty-three Poirot novels indicates that the character&#x27;s service to Christie&#x27;s literary purpose was somewhat limited.

==Career==
Similarly to his friend Poirot, details of Hastings&#x27;s life before 1916 are not revealed, though the reader is able to pinpoint Hastings&#x27;s approximate birth year as 1886 from the first chapter of &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;, as he mentions that John Cavendish was &#x27;a good fifteen years [his] senior&#x27; though hardly looking &#x27;his forty-five years&#x27;. This makes Hastings thirty years old at the start of the novel. It is also mentioned later on that he was employed at Lloyd&#x27;s prior to the war. Neither his first name nor his rank is mentioned in this novel. Elsewhere he states that he attended Eton College.

Hastings meets Poirot in Belgium several years before their meeting on 16 July 1916, at Styles Court, Essex, which is their first encounter in literature. The two remain friends right up to Poirot&#x27;s death. Although there is little evidence regarding their possible subsequent meetings, Hastings saw Poirot a year before the latter&#x27;s death.

Hastings, while being no great detective himself, serves Poirot in many ways. A former British Army officer in World War I, he is brave. He has courage and is often used by Poirot for physical duties such as catching and subduing a criminal. Poirot likes to tease Hastings about being dim-witted at times, but he clearly enjoys the Captain&#x27;s company. In &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot; and &quot;The A.B.C. Murders&quot;, Hastings plays a prominent role in the resolution of the mystery, with a casual observation that leads Poirot to the guilty party: In the case of the former, by mentioning that Poirot had to straighten some spill holders and ornaments in Styles, he prompts Poirot to realise that someone had moved them, causing Poirot to discover a crucial piece of evidence. In the case of the latter, he suggests that the error in recipient address of a letter by the murderer was deliberate, thus causing Poirot to realise the murderer had attached greater importance to that particular murder.

Hastings represents the traditional English gentleman—not too bright but absolutely scrupulous, a throwback to the Victorian-era gentleman who is always concerned about &quot;fair play&quot;. Hastings himself notes that he is somewhat old-fashioned. While Poirot, who is not above lying, surreptitiously reads other people&#x27;s letters or eavesdrops, Hastings is horrified of such acts and usually refuses to perform them to help Poirot in one of his cases. Although he lacks Poirot&#x27;s intellect, Poirot often compliments Hastings&#x27; ability to remember facts and details about their cases even if he deplores the manner in which Hastings tells the story at times. Hastings&#x27; physical appearance is rarely described in the novels because he is often the narrator, but it is mentioned that he, like Poirot, has a moustache which becomes a target of the detective&#x27;s criticism in &quot;Peril at End House&quot;: &#x27;And your moustache. If you must have a moustache, let it be a real moustache, a thing of beauty such as mine.&#x27; Although he has served in the army, Hastings is not a violent man by nature, with Poirot noting during his final letter to Hastings in &quot;Curtain&quot; that he &quot;knows&quot; that Hastings is not a murderer.

==Relationship with women==
Hastings has a soft spot for auburn-haired women. Back in &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;, Hastings was charmed with auburn-haired Cynthia Murdoch and proposed to her. This would become a running gag in the series, with Poirot often teasing Hastings. Whenever Hastings suggests the innocence of a young, beautiful, female murder suspect, Poirot slyly asks &quot;Does she have auburn hair?&quot; This pronounced weakness for pretty women with auburn hair gets Hastings and Poirot into trouble more than once: in &quot;The Big Four&quot;, while posing as secretary for millionaire Abe Ryland, Hastings trusts false information from a woman with auburn hair, while in the short story &quot;Double Sin&quot;, Hastings believes auburn-haired Mary Durant.

Despite his preference for auburn hair and his Victorian ideas about not marrying outside one&#x27;s class, he eventually falls in love with a dark-haired music-hall actress, singer and acrobat Dulcie Duveen, the self-styled &#x27;Cinderella&#x27;. They meet in the story &quot;The Murder on the Links,&quot; the second full-length Poirot novel. Poirot plays a rather significant part in uniting the couple. Hastings then acquires a ranch in Argentina and settles down to a life as a ranchholder.

==Later appearances==

Hastings&#x27;s appearances in Poirot&#x27;s later novels are restricted to a few cases in which he participates on his periodic returns to England from Argentina. Poirot comments in &quot;The ABC Murders&quot; that he enjoys Hastings&#x27;s visits because he always has his most interesting cases when Hastings is with him. In the course of &quot;The Big Four&quot;, Dulcie&#x27;s life is threatened by members of an international conspiracy. Hastings is forced to risk Poirot&#x27;s life in return for her promised safety. In other respects there is very little personal detail regarding Hastings in these novels, until &quot;Curtain: Poirot&#x27;s Last Case&quot;, which takes place after World War II: with his wife now dead, Hastings rejoins Poirot at Styles to help tackle one last case. The novel culminates with Poirot dying of a heart attack, leaving Hastings a confession explaining his role in events as he tracked a criminal who manipulated others to commit murder for him. Poirot&#x27;s friendship with Hastings is further referenced when the murderer&#x27;s attempt to manipulate Hastings in such a manner leaves Poirot resolved to kill his adversary, despite his disapproval of murder, as he knew that his friend would normally never do such a thing.

==Final appearance==

&quot;Curtain&quot; provides additional details on Hastings&#x27;s family: He and Dulcie have two sons and two daughters. One son joins the Royal Navy, while the other and his wife manage the ranch after Dulcie&#x27;s death. Hastings&#x27;s daughter Grace is married to a British officer stationed in India. His other daughter, Judith, appears as a character in &quot;Curtain&quot;. Judith is Hastings&#x27;s youngest child and his favourite, albeit the child whom he understands the least. She marries Dr John Franklin, a medical researcher, and moves to Africa with him. In the postscript of &quot;Curtain&quot;, Poirot suggests that Hastings should consider a second marriage with Elizabeth Litchfield, the younger sister of a woman who was manipulated into killing her abusive father by the novel&#x27;s antagonist. Poirot notes that Elizabeth must be reassured that she is not tainted by her sister&#x27;s actions and that Hastings is still not unattractive to women. Age is not specifically discussed for Hastings after the first book; he is said to be 30 in &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;, which would leave him at least 60 years old in the earliest setting for &quot;Curtain&quot;. That novel was published in 1975, though written during the Second World War. No specific time is made clear in &quot;Curtain&quot;, unlike most of the Poirot stories, but when Poirot says &quot;the food, it is disgusting&quot;, Hastings says &quot;rationing, I suppose&quot;. Food rationing was in place in Britain until midnight on 4 July 1954, nine years after the end of the Second World War. In addition, it is clear that the story is set when capital punishment by hanging was still occurring in the UK; the last woman hanged in the UK was in 1955. These two facts place the events of &quot;Curtain&quot; in time no later than 1954, and Hastings is therefore, as he says himself, &quot;I&#x27;m pushing it a bit&quot;; with four adult children and having done service in the First World War, he must be in his 60s.

==Portrayals==
Hastings has been portrayed on film and television by several actors, Richard Cooper in &quot;Black Coffee&quot; (1931) and &quot;Lord Edgware Dies&quot; (1934); Robert Morley in &quot;The Alphabet Murders&quot; (1965); Jonathan Cecil in three TV films – &quot;Thirteen at Dinner&quot; (1985), &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Folly&quot; (1986) and &quot;Murder in Three Acts&quot; (1986); Dmitry Krylov in the Soviet film &quot;Mystery Endhauz&quot; (1989, directed by Vadim Derbenyov); and Hugh Fraser, who portrayed Hastings alongside David Suchet&#x27;s Poirot in 43 of the 70 episodes of &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;. He is also a main character in the anime &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Great Detectives Poirot and Marple&quot;.

In the BBC Radio 4 dramatisations starring John Moffatt as Hercule Poirot, Captain Hastings was played by Jeremy Clyde in &quot;Murder on the Links&quot; (1990), and by Simon Williams in &quot;Lord Edgware Dies&quot; (1992), &quot;The ABC Murders&quot; (2000), &quot;Peril at End House&quot; (2000), &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot; (2005), and &quot;Dumb Witness&quot; (2006).

Himesh Patel will voice Hastings in Audible&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;.

==The Hastings novels==
Hastings narrates the majority of the short stories featuring Poirot, but appears in only eight of the novels, seven of which were written before 1940:

* &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot; (1916 but published in 1920)
* &quot;The Murder on the Links&quot; (1923)
* &quot;The Big Four&quot; (1927)
* &quot;Peril at End House&quot; (1932)
* &quot;Lord Edgware Dies&quot; (1933) – published in the U.S. as &quot;Thirteen at Dinner&quot;
* &quot;The A.B.C. Murders&quot; (1936)
* &quot;Dumb Witness&quot; (1937) – published in the U.S. as &quot;Poirot Loses a Client&quot;
* &quot;Curtain: Poirot&#x27;s Last Case&quot; (written in the early 1940s, published in 1975)

Hastings is the narrator of all stories in &quot;Poirot Investigates&quot; (1924), a collection of short stories. Hastings is also present in Christie&#x27;s play &quot;Black Coffee&quot; (1930) and its novelisation alongside Poirot.

<text>Red Ryder is a Western comic strip created by Stephen Slesinger and artist Fred Harman which served as the basis for a wide array of character merchandising. Syndicated by Newspaper Enterprise Association, the strip ran from Sunday, November 6, 1938, through 1965.

==&quot;Red Ryder&quot;==
In 1938, Harman met publisher, writer and comic syndicator Slesinger. At the time, Slesinger had scripted a new comic strip called &quot;Red Ryder&quot; and was seeking an outstanding Western artist with knowledge of authentic period details and who had a natural gift for drawing scenes from dramatic perspectives. Harman fit the description and was a genuine cowboy who was the ideal spokesperson for the Red Ryder Character franchise.

Slesinger brought Harman to New York and worked with him for a year before &quot;Red Ryder&quot; was ready to be launched through a carefully planned rollout from comic pages, to movies and radio shows, contests, merchandising tie-ins, and personal appearances by Harman at charity benefits, schools, and civic and &quot;Red Ryder&quot; youth enrichment events.

Slesinger pioneered the concept of synergy between radio, films, Big Little Books, novels, serial chapters, radio programs, events, rodeos, powwows, commercial tie-ins, and licensed products, such as the Daisy Red Ryder BB Gun, to build brand equity and create lasting and consistent impressions. By the time he launched &quot;Red Ryder,&quot; Slesinger had already proven his formula for creating evergreen character franchises with characters such as Tarzan, Winnie the Pooh, and many other golden-age newspaper comic characters.

&quot;Red Ryder&quot; became the longest-running and most popular comic character of the Western genre in movies, radio, comic strips, comic books, mass market retailing, and the collectors&#x27; market. Today, &quot;Red Ryder&quot; has some of the longest business relationships in the history of the licensing industry.

==Toppers==
&quot;Red Ryder&quot; had two topper strips on the Sunday page: &quot;Little Beaver&quot; (Nov 6, 1938 - Aug 25, 1946) and &quot;Red Ryder&#x27;s Corral of Western Lingo&quot; (Sept 8, 1946 - Oct 10, 1948).
==Characters and story==

Astride his mighty steed Thunder, Red was a tough cowpoke who lived on Painted Valley Ranch during the 1890s in the Blanco Basin of the San Juan Mountain Range, with his aunt, the Duchess, and his juvenile Native-American sidekick, Little Beaver, who rode his horse, Papoose, when they took off to deal with the bad guys. Little Beaver spoke in the pidgin English now considered an offensive caricature. (His most famous catchphrase was &quot;You betchum, Red Ryder!&quot;) Other notable characters were Red&#x27;s girlfriend, Beth Wilder, arch enemy Ace Hanlon, and ranch hand Buckskin Blodgett.

Harman was eventually acclaimed as one of the finest Western pen-and-ink artists, known for his dramatic sense of perspective and authentic action. Contributing artists and writers worked in Stephen Slesinger, Inc&#x27;s New York studio and contributed to &quot;Red Ryder&quot; over the years, including Jim Gary, Edmund Good, John Wade (&quot;Johnnie&quot;) Hampton, Robert MacLeod, and Bill Lignanti (of The Palm restaurant fame), Gaylord Du Bois (wrote scripts, circa 1939-1940), and Stephen Slesinger who drew detailed storyboards and scripted and approved all of the stories until he died in 1953, when Shirley Slesinger stepped into her husband&#x27;s shoes, working closely with Bill Lignanti and Jay Rowland.
Charlie Dye, Johnnie Hampton, Joe Beeler, and George Phippen were co-founders of the Cowboy Artists of America, of which Harman was also a charter member. When Harman left &quot;Red Ryder&quot; in 1963 to concentrate on his paintings, MacLeod continued writing the story continuity for the strip, with staff artists of Red Ryder Entp., Inc.

Gaylord Du Bois, a prolific comic book writer associated with Slesinger, scripted &quot;Red Ryder and Little Beaver&quot; for a short period in 1938 and again in the early 1940s.

==Comic books==

The first &quot;Red Ryder&quot; comic book was published by Slesinger&#x27;s Hawley Publications, Inc. in September 1940, followed by &quot;Hi-Spot&quot; comics for one issue.

Dell Comics launched its &quot;Red Ryder&quot; in August 1941, changing its title to &quot;Red Ryder Ranch Magazine&quot; with #145, and then to &quot;Red Ryder Ranch Comics&quot; with #149. &quot;Red Ryder Comics&quot; consisted of reprints of the newspaper strip until issue #47 (June 1947), when it began producing original material. Altogether, Red Ryder Comics enjoyed a first run, for a total of 151 issues, ending in 1957, one of the longest continuous newsstand runs in the U.S., for any Western comic. Over the next four decades, under license from Red Ryder, Enterprises, Inc., King Features Syndicate distributed comic reprints translated into 11 languages, while unauthorized translations have been printed in 30 languages. However, by far, the largest circulation for Red Ryder Comics are those produced in Spanish and distributed throughout the Spanish-speaking world. From 1954 to 1984, under an exclusive licensing agreement with Red Ryder Enterprises, Inc., Novaro distributed 474 regular editions plus extras and specials in 21 countries and territories.

==In other media==
=== Radio ===

The &quot;Red Ryder&quot; radio series began February 3, 1942, on the Blue Network. broadcast three times a week at 7:30 pm Pacific time. When the Blue also acquired &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; from the Mutual Broadcasting System, Mutual decided to compete by airing &quot;Red Ryder&quot; in the same period. Thus, &quot;Red Ryder&quot; aired on the East Coast that year from May 20 to September 9 on Mutual. The series beat &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; in the Hooper ratings, but the success was short-lived. &quot;Red Ryder&quot; was sold to a regional sponsor, Langendorf Bread, and after four months was no longer heard in the East.

Mutual and Langendorf continued the series on the West Coast Don Lee Network through the 1940s at 7:30 pm on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, always with the familiar organ theme, &quot;The Dying Cowboy&quot; (&quot;Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie&quot;). Announcers on the show included Ben Alexander and Art Gilmore.

The continuing characters of the comic strip were also found in the radio series, produced by Brad Brown with writer-director Paul Franklin and writer Albert Van Antwerp. Reed Hadley portrayed Red Ryder on the radio from 1942 to 1944, followed by Carlton KaDell (1945), and Brooke Temple (1946–51). Arthur Q. Bryan had the role of Roland &quot;Rawhide&quot; Rolinson, and Red&#x27;s sidekick Buckskin was played by Horace Murphy. Jim Mather provided Indian voices.

Numerous actors played Little Beaver, including members of the Hopi, Jicarilla Apache, Southern Ute, and Navajo Nations. One of the most notable was Robert Blake (on credits as Bobby Blake), Tommy Cook (1942 on), Frank Bresee (1942–46, alternating with Cook), Henry Blair (1944–47), Johnny McGovern (1947–50), and Sammy Ogg (1950–51). During the same mid-1940s time frame, Henry Blair also portrayed Ricky Nelson on &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;.

Billed as &quot;America&#x27;s famous fighting cowboy,&quot; Red Ryder was notable because he did not kill his enemies but instead aimed for their guns to disarm them. Such sound effects were handled by James Dick, Monty Fraser, and Bob Turnbull.

===Films and television===
Red Ryder appeared in a 1940 12-chapter serial, followed by a series of 27 movies (the last four of which were in color). It began in 1940 with the 12-chapter Republic movie serial &quot;The Adventures of Red Ryder&quot;, played by Don &quot;Red&quot; Barry, who got his nickname &quot;Red&quot; from the role and Tommy Cook as Red Ryder&#x27;s young Indian sidekick Little Beaver. Subsequently, Wild Bill Elliott and Allan &quot;Rocky&quot; Lane portrayed Red Ryder in several films, both working with Robert Blake as Little Beaver. The last four Red Ryder movies starred Jim Bannon as Red Ryder and Don Kay (&quot;Little Brown Jug&quot;) Reynolds as Little Beaver. Both Bannon and Lane filmed pilots for a &quot;Red Ryder&quot; television series, created by Stephen Slesinger, but neither version was picked up by a network. Both pilots survive and appear in various western DVD collections. An episode of Gunsmoke entitled &quot;I Call Him Wonder&quot; was produced in 1963 as a backdoor pilot for a new Red Ryder and Little Beaver TV Show.

====Telecomics Films====
Stephen Slesinger&#x27;s Telecomics Presents
produced three television pilots from 1949-1952.

The pilots were filmed on The Little Beaver and Red
Ryder Ranches, in Colorado&#x27;s Blanco Basin, near
Pagosa Springs. The Little Beaver Ranch was
built, by Slesinger, to resemble a Western
Town. Guests stayed in cabins with facades such
as The Court House, Saloon, and Jail.

To film a cut-away Cattle Stampede, 
Slesinger paid local ranchers fifty cents, 
for each pound their stock lost, as a result of 
running in the stampede.

In summers Fred Harman&#x27;s Red Ryder Ranch and 
Stephen Slesinger&#x27;s Little Beaver Ranch hosted 
settlement house boys and other youth. 
In July 2020 The Red Ryder Cowboy Honor Club celebrates 
the 80th Anniversary of these outdoor youth programs.
2020 is also the 70th Anniversary year, of the Red Ryder 
Roundup Rodeo and July Fourth Celebration, in Pagosa Springs.

====&quot;Gunsmoke&quot; episode====
&quot;Gunsmoke&quot;&#x27;s 1963 TV Episode 
&quot;I Call Him Wonder&quot; was an authorized
test for a New Red Ryder TV series that
was not picked up. It features Little Beaver
as Wonder, and is adapted from the original
story of how Red Ryder and Little Beaver
first met.

==Products==
Slesinger&#x27;s marketing synergy for &quot;Red Ryder&quot; and &quot;Little Beaver&quot; products was trail-blazing. &quot;Red Ryder&quot; toys; novelties; gifts; accessories; sporting goods; and rugged outdoor, work, and play clothing were sold nationwide and exported by leading North American manufacturers to Europe, Latin America, and as far as Egypt, India, and Japan.

At JC Penney stores across the country, Slesinger created &quot;Red Ryder&quot; &quot;outposts for dependable American quality and value.&quot; These stores within the store were called &quot;Red Ryder Corrals.&quot; In addition to educational and sportsmanship contests, special events, and personal appearances, they supplied Red Ryder brand rugged clothing for men and boys. In addition to &quot;Red Ryder&quot; and &quot;Little Beaver&quot; outdoor products, licensing included school supplies, lunch kits, and other &quot;Red Ryder&quot; character hardware and sporting goods.

The outposts also included the legendary Daisy Red Ryder Carbine, which became a father-to-son Christmas gift tradition as memorialized in the 1983 Jean Shepherd film &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;. The story revolves around the author&#x27;s childhood memories and a boy trying to get a &quot;Red Ryder Carbine-Action Two-Hundred-Shot Range Model Air Rifle BB gun with a compass in the stock and a thing which tells time&quot; for Christmas. The film was adapted from the autobiographical fiction of Jean Shepherd, by permission of Red Ryder Enterprises, Inc., which owns the Red Ryder trademarks and copyrights.

==Parody==
&quot;Buckaroo Bugs&quot; (1944) features Bugs Bunny in the Wild West with &quot;Red Hot Ryder&quot; as his nemesis.

<doc id="261290" wikidata="Q6518229" url="?curid=261290" title="Legislative consent motion">
<text>A legislative consent motion (LCM, also known as a Sewel motion in Scotland) is a motion passed by either the Scottish Parliament, Senedd, or Northern Ireland Assembly, in which it consents that the Parliament of the United Kingdom may (or may not) pass legislation on a devolved issue over which the devolved government has regular legislative authority.

, the three devolved governments have refused or partially refused legislative consent motions on 20 occasions. However, even if consent is refused, the Parliament of the United Kingdom may still pass legislation on the devolved issue in question under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty and the understanding that the United Kingdom is a unitary state.

==Background==
The Scotland Act 1998 devolved many issues relating to legislation for Scotland to the Scottish Parliament. The UK Parliament maintains parliamentary sovereignty and may legislate on any issue, with or without the permission of the devolved assemblies and parliaments.

The motions were named after Lord Sewel, then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland who announced the policy in the House of Lords during the passage of the Scotland Act 1998. Noting that the Act recognised the parliamentary sovereignty of the British Parliament, he said that HM Government &quot;would expect a convention to be established that Westminster would not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters in Scotland without the consent of the Scottish Parliament&quot;.

The devolved governments have no formal say in how the British Parliament legislates on reserved matters.

==Use and application==
There are two uses for a legislative consent motion, taking Scotland as the example:

# When the UK Parliament is considering legislation extending only (or having provisions extending only) to England and Wales, and the Scottish Parliament, being in agreement with those provisions, wishes for the UK Parliament to extend them to Scotland. This saves the need for separate, similar legislation to be passed by the Scottish Parliament.
# When Westminster is considering legislation applying to Scotland but which relates to both devolved and reserved matters, where it would otherwise be necessary for the Scottish Parliament to legislate to complete the jigsaw.

As well as legislation about devolved matters, the convention extends to cases where UK bills give executive powers to Scottish Ministers, including in reserved areas, or which seek to change the boundary between reserved and devolved matters.

Guidance on the use of legislative consent motions for Whitehall departments is set out in &quot;Devolution Guidance Note 10&quot;.

Chapter 9B of the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s Standing Orders specify the procedure for considering Sewel motions.

==Legal status==

The convention under which the UK government uses legislative consent motions is not legally binding. It was originally contained in a &quot;memorandum of understanding&quot; between the UK government and the devolved administrations. That document states in an explanatory note that it is not intended to be legally binding, and the paragraph dealing with the convention makes clear that the UK Parliament retains authority to legislate on any issue, whether devolved or not.

Since then, however, the convention has been incorporated into law in both Scotland and Wales. However, despite this inclusion, the statements are not legally binding on the UK Parliament.

===Scotland Act 2016===
In 2016 the UK Parliament passed the Scotland Act 2016 which amended the Scotland Act 1998 to contain an explicit and specific legal reference to the so-called Sewel convention. Section 2 of the 2016 Act reads as follows:

===Wales Act 2017===
In 2017 the UK Parliament passed the Wales Act 2017 which amended the Government of Wales Act 2006 to contain an explicit and specific legal reference to Westminster legislation on matters that are devolved to the Welsh Assembly. Section 2 of the 2017 Act reads as follows:

==Current situation and review==

In 2005 the Procedures Committee undertook an inquiry into the use of Sewel motions, and heard evidence from Lord Sewel, Henry McLeish (the former First Minister of Scotland), and Anne McGuire, MP (the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland). Following the review, the motions were retitled legislative consent motions and the procedures enshrined in the parliament&#x27;s standing orders.

, 131 legislative consent motions had been passed by the Scottish Parliament, 39 in the first session (1999–2003), 38 in the second (2003–2007), 30 in the third (2007–11) and 24 so far in the fourth (2011–16).

In December 2022, the Labour Party announced proposals to strengthen the Sewel convention such that it becomes &quot;constitutionally protected&quot;, as part of a report on constitutional reform led by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

<doc id="261292" wikidata="Q432143" url="?curid=261292" title="Inspector Japp">
<text>Inspector James Japp (later Chief Inspector Japp) is a fictional character who appears in several of Agatha Christie&#x27;s novels featuring Hercule Poirot.

==Creation==
Inspector Japp was inspired by the fictional police detective Inspector Lestrade from the Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. Christie even modelled Japp after the &quot;ferret-like&quot; qualities of Lestrade. In the first novel in which Japp appears, &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;, he is described as a &quot;ferret-faced man&quot;, which is similar to the description of Lestrade as a &quot;ferret-like man&quot; in Doyle&#x27;s 1891 short story &quot;The Boscombe Valley Mystery&quot;.

==Appearances==
Japp has been depicted in seven novels written by Christie, all featuring Hercule Poirot:
*&quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot; (1920)
*&quot;The Big Four&quot; (1927)
*&quot;Peril at End House&quot; (1932)
*&quot;Lord Edgware Dies&quot; (1933), also known as &quot;Thirteen at Dinner&quot;
*&quot;Death in the Clouds&quot; (1935), also known as &quot;Death in the Air&quot;
*&quot;The A.B.C. Murders&quot; (1936), also known as &quot;The Alphabet Murders&quot;
*&quot;One, Two, Buckle My Shoe&quot; (1940), also known as &quot;An Overdose of Death&quot; and &quot;The Patriotic Murders&quot;. This is his last appearance in any work by Christie, although he is briefly mentioned in two later works.

In most of these appearances, Japp is a minor character with minimal interactions with Poirot or involvement in the plot. He also appears in the short story &quot;The Flock of Geryon&quot; (see &quot;The Labours of Hercules&quot;). 

Japp emerges however as a major character and partner to Poirot in &quot;Lord Edgware Dies&quot;. He returns in this capacity in &quot;Death in the Clouds&quot; and &quot;One, Two, Buckle My Shoe&quot;, before being written out of the series. In number of appearances, Japp is comparable to Arthur Hastings who was featured in eight of the Poirot novels.

Inspector Japp is also briefly mentioned in the Tommy and Tuppence book &quot;The Secret Adversary&quot; (1922); his card is brought to Julius Hersheimmer at the end of chapter five. In chapter seventeen of &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot; (1926), Japp is mentioned by a police superintendent to Poirot as having asked after him. Japp is mentioned by Poirot in &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (1937), and by Colonel Weston in &quot;Evil Under the Sun&quot; (1941), the next book in the Poirot series after his final appearance. Japp is also mentioned in the novel &quot;Taken at the Flood&quot; (1948) by Superintendent Spence during a conversation with Hercule Poirot.

Japp&#x27;s career in the Poirot novels extends into the 1930s but, like Hastings, he disappeared from Christie&#x27;s writing thereafter. A police officer somewhat similar in character (Superintendent Spence) was introduced as a significant recurring character in the later Poirot novels.

Japp appears in Christie&#x27;s stage play &quot;Black Coffee&quot;, written in 1929. He remarks to Poirot that it has been a &quot;long time&quot; since they last met, in connection with &quot;that Welsh case&quot;, which is not otherwise identified. Japp also appears in Charles Osborne&#x27;s novelisation of &quot;Black Coffee&quot;.

Like those of Miss Lemon and Arthur Hastings, the role of Inspector Japp in Poirot&#x27;s career has been exaggerated by adaptations of Christie&#x27;s original novels, specifically by the TV series &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;, where these characters are often introduced into stories that did not originally feature them.

==Characteristics==

Inspector Japp has a tendency to jump to conclusions, and to accept simple solutions to cases. However, he becomes a more competent and respected police detective over time, eventually earning a promotion to Chief Inspector and demonstrating his capability in this position. He respects Poirot&#x27;s abilities but is sometimes rude to him, though over the years, he becomes more of a friend to Poirot and works more closely with him. Japp sometimes accuses Poirot of &quot;making things difficult&quot; when Poirot contradicts a solution which Japp believes is correct; however, when Japp is proved wrong, he acknowledges his mistake and makes remarks such as &quot;you&#x27;re the goods!&quot; to Poirot. In &quot;One, Two, Buckle My Shoe&quot;, the last novel in which he appears, Japp visits Poirot at his flat to apologise after doubting him and to tell Poirot he was right.

When off duty, Japp is an &quot;ardent botanist&quot;, according to Hastings in the 1923 short story &quot;The Market Basing Mystery&quot;. Japp is described as &quot;little, sharp, dark and ferret-faced&quot; in the 1920 novel &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;, and as a &quot;little ferret-faced fellow&quot; in the 1923 short story &quot;The Kidnapped Prime Minister&quot;.

==Portrayals==

The role of Japp is played by Philip Jackson in the British TV series &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;, where Hercule Poirot&#x27;s character is played by David Suchet. Before Suchet took on the role of Poirot, he had previously played Japp himself in the 1985 film &quot;Thirteen at Dinner&quot;, where Peter Ustinov played Poirot. Philip Jackson portrays Japp as working-class and &#x27;thoroughly British&#x27;, not very intelligent but an extremely diligent, canny and active police officer with a good but rather dry sense of humour, characteristics which often serve as a perfect foil to Poirot&#x27;s personality, who is intelligent, elegant, upper-class but rather slow in movements and of a very serious nature.

In the same television series, Japp is already a Chief Inspector in the first episode, his full name is James Harold Japp according to the episode &quot;The Chocolate Box&quot;, and he has been promoted to Assistant Commissioner by the time he appears in the episode &quot;The Big Four&quot;.

Philip Jackson is also one of the actors who played Japp in the BBC Radio adaptations of Poirot stories, produced contemporaneously with the Suchet TV series and starring John Moffatt as Poirot. In the radio dramatisations, Inspector Japp was played by Norman Jones in &quot;Lord Edgware Dies&quot; (1992), by Philip Jackson in &quot;The ABC Murders&quot; (2000), &quot;Death In The Clouds&quot; (2003), &quot;One, Two, Buckle My Shoe&quot; (2004), and &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot; (2005), and by Bryan Pringle in &quot;Peril at End House&quot; (2000).

Japp is played by Melville Cooper in the 1931 film adaptation of Christie&#x27;s stage play &quot;Black Coffee&quot;.

As the inspector&#x27;s name is spelled similarly and pronounced in the same way as the ethnic slur Jap, he was renamed in the Japanese anime series &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Great Detectives Poirot and Marple&quot; (NHK, 2004).

In the &quot;Professor Layton&quot; series of puzzle video games for the Nintendo DS and Nintendo 3DS, the fictional Scotland Yard chief inspector Chelmey appears visually and contextually as a comically incompetent caricature of Inspector Japp as played by Philip Jackson.

A retired Japp is played by Kevin McNally in &quot;The ABC Murders&quot; (2018); the series starts with Japp dying of a heart attack, and a recurring sub-plot is Inspector Crome, Japp&#x27;s protege, expressing distrust of Poirot as he feels that working with Poirot ruined Japp&#x27;s career.

<text>Sea monsters are beings from folklore believed to dwell in the sea and are often imagined to be of immense size. Marine monsters can take many forms, including sea dragons, sea serpents, or tentacled beasts. They can be slimy and scaly and are often pictured threatening ships or spouting jets of water. The definition of a &quot;monster&quot; is subjective; further, some sea monsters may have been based on scientifically accepted creatures, such as whales and types of giant and colossal squid.

==Sightings and legends==
 
Sea monster accounts are found in virtually all cultures that have contact with the sea. For example, Avienius relates of Carthaginian explorer Himilco&#x27;s voyage &quot;...there monsters of the deep, and beasts swim amid the slow and sluggishly crawling ships.&quot; (lines 117–29 of &quot;Ora Maritima&quot;). Sir Humphrey Gilbert claimed to have encountered a lion-like monster with &quot;glaring eyes&quot; on his return voyage after formally claiming St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland (1583) for England. Another account of an encounter with a sea monster comes from July 1734. Hans Egede, a Dano-Norwegian missionary, reported that on a voyage to Godthåb on the western coast of Greenland he observed:

a most terrible creature, resembling nothing they saw before. The monster lifted its head so high that it seemed to be higher than the crow&#x27;s nest on the mainmast. The head was small and the body short and wrinkled. The unknown creature was using giant fins which propelled it through the water. Later the sailors saw its tail as well. The monster was longer than our whole ship.
Ellis (1999) suggested the Egede monster might have been a giant squid.

There is a Tlingit legend about a sea monster named Gunakadeit (Goo-na&#x27;-ka-date) who brought prosperity and good luck to a village in crisis, people starving in the home they made for themselves on the southeastern coast of Alaska.

Other reports are known from the Pacific, Indian and Southern Oceans (e.g. see Heuvelmans 1968). Cryptozoologists suggest that modern-day sea monsters are surviving specimens of giant marine reptiles, such as an ichthyosaur or plesiosaur, from the Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods, or extinct whales like &quot;Basilosaurus&quot;. Ship damage from Tropical cyclones such as hurricanes or typhoons may also be another possible origin of sea monsters.

In 1892, Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans, then director of the Royal Zoological Gardens at The Hague, saw the publication of his &quot;The Great Sea Serpent&quot;, which suggested that many sea serpent reports were best accounted for as a previously unknown giant, long-necked pinniped.

It is likely that many other reports of sea monsters are misinterpreted sightings of shark and whale carcasses (see below), floating kelp, logs or other flotsam such as abandoned rafts, canoes and fishing nets.

==Alleged carcasses==

Sea monster corpses have been reported since recent antiquity (Heuvelmans 1968). Unidentified carcasses are often called globsters. The alleged plesiosaur netted by the Japanese trawler &quot;Zuiyō Maru&quot; off New Zealand caused a sensation in 1977 and was immortalized on a Brazilian postage stamp before it was suggested by the FBI to be the decomposing carcass of a basking shark. Likewise, DNA testing confirmed that an alleged sea monster washed up on Newfoundland in August 2001, was a sperm whale.

Another modern example of a &quot;sea monster&quot; was the strange creature washed up in Los Muermos on the Chilean sea shore in July 2003. It was first described as a &quot;mammoth jellyfish as long as a bus&quot; but was later determined to be another corpse of a sperm whale. Cases of boneless, amorphic globsters are sometimes believed to be gigantic octopuses, but it has now been determined that sperm whales dying at sea decompose in such a way that the blubber detaches from the body, forming featureless whitish masses that sometimes exhibit a hairy texture due to exposed strands of collagen fibers. The analysis of the &quot;Zuiyō Maru&quot; carcass revealed a comparable phenomenon in decomposing basking shark carcasses, which lose most of the lower head area and the dorsal and caudal fins first, making them resemble a plesiosaur.

In May 2017, &quot;The Guardian&quot; published an article claiming a giant sea monster&#x27;s corpse was found in Indonesia, and also published an alleged photograph of &quot;it.&quot;

<doc id="261297" wikidata="Q3002742" url="?curid=261297" title="2000–2001 California electricity crisis">
<text>The 2000–2001 California electricity crisis, also known as the Western U.S. energy crisis of 2000 and 2001, was a period during which the U.S. state of California had a shortage of electricity supply caused by market manipulations and capped retail electricity prices. The state suffered from multiple large-scale blackouts, one of the state&#x27;s largest energy companies collapsed, and the economic fall-out greatly harmed Governor Gray Davis&#x27;s standing.

Drought, and delays in approval of new power plants, also decreased supply. This caused an 800% increase in wholesale prices from April 2000 to December 2000. In addition, rolling blackouts adversely affected many businesses dependent upon a reliable supply of electricity, and inconvenienced many retail consumers.

California had an installed generating capacity of 45 GW (gigawatts, or billions-of-watts). At the time of the blackouts, demand was 28 GW. A demand-supply gap was created by energy companies, mainly Enron, to create artificial shortages. Energy traders took power plants offline for maintenance during days of peak demand to increase the price. Traders were thus able to sell power at premium prices, sometimes up to a factor of twenty times its normal value. Because the state government had a cap on retail electricity charges, this market manipulation squeezed the industry&#x27;s revenue margins, causing the bankruptcy of Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) and near bankruptcy of Southern California Edison in early 2001.

According to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the crisis was possible because of legislation instituted in 1996 by the California Legislature (AB 1890) and Governor Pete Wilson that deregulated some aspects of the energy industry. Enron took advantage of this partial deregulation and was involved in economic withholding and inflated price bidding in California&#x27;s spot markets.

The crisis cost between US$40 and $45 billion.

== Causes ==

=== Market manipulation ===

As the FERC report concluded, market manipulation was only possible as a result of the complex market design produced by the process of partial deregulation. Manipulation strategies were known to energy traders under names such as &quot;Fat Boy&quot;, &quot;Death Star&quot;, &quot;Forney Perpetual Loop&quot;, &quot;Wheel Out&quot;, &quot;Ricochet&quot;, &quot;Ping Pong&quot;, &quot;Black Widow&quot;, &quot;Big Foot&quot;, &quot;Red Congo&quot;, &quot;Cong Catcher&quot; and &quot;Get Shorty&quot;. 

In a letter sent from David Fabian to Senator Boxer in 2002, it was alleged that:
: &quot;There is a single connection between northern and southern California&#x27;s power grids. I heard that Enron traders purposely overbooked that line, then caused others to need it. Next, by California&#x27;s free-market rules, Enron was allowed to price-gouge at will.&quot;

=== Effects of partial deregulation ===

On a federal level, the Energy Policy Act of 1992, for which Enron had lobbied, opened electrical transmission grids to competition, unbundling generation and transmission of electricity.

On the state level, part of California&#x27;s deregulation process, which was promoted as a means of increasing competition, was also influenced by lobbying from Enron, and began in 1996 when California became the first state to deregulate its electricity market. 

Energy deregulation put the three companies that distribute electricity into a tough situation. Energy deregulation policy froze or capped the existing price of energy that the three energy distributors could charge. Deregulating the producers of energy did not lower the cost of energy. Deregulation did not encourage new producers to create more power and drive down prices. Instead, with increasing demand for electricity, the producers of energy charged more for electricity. The producers used moments of spike energy production to inflate the price of energy. In January 2001, energy producers began shutting down plants to increase prices.

=== Government price caps ===

By keeping the consumer price of electricity artificially low, the California government discouraged citizens from practicing conservation. In February 2001, California governor Gray Davis stated, &quot;Believe me, if I wanted to raise rates I could have solved this problem in 20 minutes.&quot; However, in San Diego, where San Diego Gas &amp; Electric had paid off its debt, market rates were charged beginning in July 1999. Prices doubled in two months due to a hot summer, and people protested by not paying their full bills and calling the power company.

When the electricity demand in California rose, utilities had no financial incentive to expand production, as long term prices were capped. Instead, wholesalers such as Enron manipulated the market to force utility companies into daily spot markets for short term gain. For example, in a market technique known as megawatt laundering, wholesalers bought up electricity in California at below cap price to sell out of state, creating shortages. In some instances, wholesalers scheduled power transmission to create congestion and drive up prices.

After extensive investigation, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) substantially agreed in 2003:

: &quot;...supply-demand imbalance, flawed market design and inconsistent rules made possible significant market manipulation as delineated in final investigation report. Without underlying market dysfunction, attempts to manipulate the market would not be successful.&quot;

: &quot;...many trading strategies employed by Enron and other companies violated the anti-gaming provisions...&quot;

: &quot;Electricity prices in California’s spot markets were affected by economic withholding and inflated price bidding, in violation of tariff anti-gaming provisions.&quot;

=== New regulations ===
In the mid-1990s, under Republican Governor Pete Wilson, California began changing the electricity industry. Democratic State Senator Steve Peace was the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy at the time and is often credited as &quot;the father of deregulation&quot;. The author of the bill was Senator Jim Brulte, a Republican from Rancho Cucamonga. Wilson admitted publicly that defects in the deregulation system would need fixing by &quot;the next governor&quot;.

=== Supply and demand ===

California&#x27;s population increased by 13% during the 1990s. The State did not build any new major power plants during that time, and California&#x27;s generation capability decreased 2 percent from 1990 through 1999, while retail sales increased by 11 percent.

California&#x27;s utilities came to depend in part on the import of excess hydroelectricity from the Pacific Northwest states of Oregon and Washington. During that time, California relied upon out-of-state generators to supply 7 to 11 gigawatts of power. 

In the summer of 2001 a drought in the northwest states reduced the amount of hydroelectric power available to California. Moreover, wholesale prices of natural gas spiked nationwide, rising from around $2 per at the beginning of 1999 to over $10 per million BTU in the winter of 2000-2001.

The main line which allowed electricity to travel from the north to the south, Path 15, had not been improved for many years and became a major bottleneck point which limited the amount of power that could be sent south to 3,900 MW.

The International Energy Agency estimates that a 5% lowering of demand would result in a 50% price reduction during the peak hours of the California electricity crisis in 2000/2001. With better demand response the market also becomes more resilient to intentional withdrawal of offers from the supply side.

== Some key events ==

Rolling blackouts affecting 97,000 customers hit the San Francisco Bay area on June 14, 2000, and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Company filed a complaint alleging market manipulation by some energy producers in August 2000. On December 7, 2000, suffering from low supply and idled power plants, the California Independent System Operator (ISO), which manages the California power grid, declared the first statewide Stage 3 power alert, meaning power reserves were below 3 percent. Rolling blackouts were avoided when the state halted two large state and federal water pumps to conserve electricity.

Most notably, the city of Los Angeles was unaffected by the crisis because government-owned public utilities in California (including the Los Angeles Department of Water &amp; Power) were exempt from the deregulation legislation and sold their excess power to private utilities in the state (mostly to Southern California Edison) during the crises. That enabled much of the greater Los Angeles area to suffer only rolling brown-outs rather than long term black outs suffered in other parts of the state.

== Consequences of wholesale price rises on the retail market ==

As a result of the actions of electricity wholesalers, Southern California Edison (SCE) and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E) were buying from a spot market at very high prices but were unable to raise retail rates. For a product that the IOU&#x27;s used to produce for about three cents per kilowatt hour of electricity, they were paying eleven to fifty cents, or occasionally even more, but they were capped at 6.7 cents per kilowatt hour when charging their retail customers. As a result, PG&amp;E filed bankruptcy, and Southern California Edison worked diligently on a workout plan with the State of California to save their company from the same fate.

According to a 2007 study of Department of Energy data by Power in the Public Interest, retail electricity prices rose much more from 1999 to 2007 in states that adopted deregulation than in those that did not.

== Involvement of Enron ==

One of the energy wholesalers that became notorious for &quot;gaming the market&quot; and reaping huge speculative profits was Enron Corporation. Enron CEO Kenneth Lay mocked the efforts by the California state government to thwart the practices of the energy wholesalers, insisting &quot;no matter what we &#x27;crazy people in California&#x27; did that he had people working for him at Enron that could figure out a way to make money.&quot; The original statement was made in a phone conversation between S. David Freeman (Chairman of the California Power Authority) and Kenneth Lay in 2000, according to the statements made by Freeman to the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs, Foreign Commerce and Tourism in April and May 2002.

S. David Freeman, who was appointed Chair of the California Power Authority in the midst of the crisis, made the following statements about Enron&#x27;s involvement in testimony submitted before the Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs, Foreign Commerce and Tourism of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation on May 15, 2002:

: &quot;There is one fundamental lesson we must learn from this experience: electricity is really different from everything else. It cannot be stored, it cannot be seen, and we cannot do without it, which makes opportunities to take advantage of a deregulated market endless. It is a public good that must be protected from private abuse. If Murphy&#x27;s Law were written for a market approach to electricity, then the law would state &#x27;any system that can be gamed, will be gamed, and at the worst possible time.&#x27; And a market approach for electricity is inherently gameable. Never again can we allow private interests to create artificial or even real shortages and to be in control.

: &quot;Enron stood for secrecy and a lack of responsibility. In electric power, we must have openness and companies that are responsible for keeping the lights on. We need to go back to companies that own power plants with clear responsibilities for selling real power under long-term contracts. There is no place for companies like Enron that own the equivalent of an electronic telephone book and game the system to extract an unnecessary middleman’s profits. Companies with power plants can compete for contracts to provide the bulk of our power at reasonable prices that reflect costs. People say that Governor Davis has been vindicated by the Enron confession.&quot;

== Handling of the crisis ==

=== Governor Gray Davis ===

Some critics, such as Arianna Huffington, alleged that Davis was lulled to inaction by campaign contributions from energy producers. In addition, the California State Legislature would sometimes push Davis to act decisively by taking over power plants which were known to have been gamed and place them back under control of the utilities, ensuring a more steady supply and punished the worst manipulators. Meanwhile, conservatives argued that Davis signed overpriced energy contracts, employed incompetent negotiators, and refused to allow prices to rise for residences statewide much like they did in San Diego, which they argue could have given Davis more leverage against the energy traders and encouraged more conservation. More criticism is given in the book &quot;Conspiracy of Fools&quot;, which gives the details of a meeting between the governor and his officials; Clinton Administration Treasury officials; and energy executives, including market manipulators such as Enron, where Gray Davis disagreed with the treasury officials and energy executives. They advised suspending environmental studies to build power plants and a small rate hike to prepare for long-term power contracts (Davis eventually signed overpriced ones, as noted above), while Davis supported price caps, denounced the other solutions as too politically risky, and allegedly acted rudely. The contracts Davis signed locked Californians into high electric costs for the next decade. As of October 2011 electric rates in California had yet to return to pre-contract levels.

=== Arnold Schwarzenegger ===

On May 17, 2001, future Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former Los Angeles Mayor Republican Richard Riordan met with Enron CEO Kenneth Lay at the Peninsula Beverly Hills Hotel in Beverly Hills. The meeting was convened for Enron to present its &quot;Comprehensive Solution for California,&quot; which called for an end to federal and state investigations into Enron&#x27;s role in the California energy crisis.

On October 7, 2003, Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California to replace Davis.

Over a year later, he attended the commissioning ceremony of a new Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) 500 kV line remedying the aforementioned power bottleneck on Path 15.

=== Congressional response to the crisis ===

In the Spring of 2001, House Government Affairs Energy Policy and Regulatory Affairs Subcommittee Chairman Doug Ose held a series of field hearings in California and Nevada, receiving testimony from Public Utilities Commission Chair Loretta Lynch, FERC General Counsel Kevin Madden, California ISO President and CEO Terry Winter and Central Valley farmers. During the hearings, the state and federal representatives cast blame on each other, but there was consensus that warning signals to the crisis were missed repeatedly.

=== Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ===

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) was intimately involved with the handling of the crisis from the summer of 2000. There were in fact at least four separate FERC investigations.
* The Gaming Case, investigating general allegations of manipulation of the Western energy markets.
* The Enron Western Markets Investigation, FERC Docket Number PA02-2, specifically investigating the involvement of Enron and other companies in manipulating the energy markets.
* The Refund Case, involving wide-ranging recovery of illegal profits made by some companies during the crisis.
* The Economic Withholding and Anomalous Bidding Case.

In December 2005, the Commission filed a report to the U. S. Congress on its response to the California Electricity Crisis, which states that &quot;To date, the Commission staff has facilitated settlements resulting in over $6.3 billion&quot;.

On August 17, 2013, the British Columbia company Powerex agreed to a $750 million refund as a settlement over charges of manipulating electricity prices during 2000.

<text>Cyclomedusa is a circular fossil of the Ediacaran biota; it has a circular bump in the middle and as many as five circular growth ridges around it. Many specimens are small, but specimens in excess of 20 cm are known. The concentric disks are not necessarily circular, especially when adjacent individuals interfere with each other&#x27;s growth. Many radial segment lines — somewhat pineapple-like — extend across the outer disks. A few specimens show what might be a stem extending from the center in some direction or other.

&quot;Cyclomedusa&quot; is widely distributed in Ediacaran strata, with a number of species described. It has also been found in sediments dating to the Tonian (~). &quot;Cyclomedusa&quot; was originally thought to be a jellyfish but some specimens seem to be distorted to accommodate adjacent specimens on the substrate, apparently indicating a benthic (bottom-dwelling) creature. The markings do not match the musculature pattern of modern jellyfish. The fossils have been conjectured to represent a holdfast for some stalked form — possibly an octacorallian, or something else entirely. Alternatively, it was thought that the described species actually represent different modes of preservation for one organism or that several different organisms have been grouped together under one name as a form taxon.

It is now suggested that &quot;Cyclomedusa&quot; was a microbial colony; D. Grazhdankin reinterprets the concentric rings and radial structures as comparable to those seen in modern-day microbial colonies exposed to homogeneously distributed environmental conditions.

&quot;Cyclomedusa&quot; is known from Neoproterozoic beds in Ediacara (Australia), Finnmark (Norway), Charnwood Forest (England), Olenek (Russia), North China, Newfoundland, Northwest Canada, Podolia (Ukraine), the Ural Mountains (Russia), the White Sea (Russia), Sonora (Mexico), and Ceará (Brazil). It is regarded as a member of the Ediacaran biota— a group of somewhat obscure organisms that thrived just before most of the modern multicellular animal phyla appeared. &quot;Cyclomedusa&quot; has no known relatives.

<doc id="261300" wikidata="Q2497541" url="?curid=261300" title="Joaquín Crespo">
<text>Joaquín Sinforiano de Jesús Crespo Torres (; 22 August 1841 – 16 April 1898) was a Venezuelan military officer and politician. A member of the Great Liberal Party of Venezuela, he served as the president of Venezuela from 1884 to 1886 and again from 1892 to 1898. He began his career as a soldier during the Federal War.

== Presidency ==
Joaquín Crespo became president for the first time in 1884. In 1886 Guzmán Blanco returned as president. Crespo went into exile during the presidency of Juan Pablo Rojas Paúl which marked a break from Guzmán Blanco&#x27;s policies.

During the second Joaquín Crespo regime, which began in 1892, a new constitution increased the presidential term. The Venezuelan crisis of 1895 saw Venezuela&#x27;s longstanding territorial dispute with Great Britain come to a head, with the United States providing diplomatic support to Venezuela. Britain claimed the territory as part of British Guiana while Venezuela saw it as Venezuelan. The disputed border was submitted to international arbitration. The arbitral panel awarded most of the territory to Britain in 1899 after Crespo&#x27;s death.

== Subsequent career ==
In 1897, Crespo did not campaign for a third presidential term but supported Ignacio Andrade against key opponent Jose Manuel Hernandez. Andrade won the election and inaugurated his term on 28 February, 1898 . Hernandez decried the results as fraudulent and took up arms. Hernandez was quickly defeated, with resultant political turmoil.

== Death ==
Crespo, who remained a military mainstay of the government, was killed in battle on 16 April 1898 in the Combat of Mata Carmelera while defending the government of Andrade.

He was buried in the Southern General Cemetery. During the crisis in Venezuela, in 2018, the tomb of Crespo and his wife Jacinta was looted and vandalized, leaving their bodies exposed to the elements.

==Personal life==
Crespo was married to Jacinta Parejo, who served as First Lady of Venezuela from 1884 to 1886, and 1892–1898.

<text>Phillip E. Johnson (June 18, 1940 – November 2, 2019) was an American legal scholar who was the Jefferson E. Peyser Professor of Law at the University of California, Berkeley. He was an opponent of evolutionary science, co-founder of the Discovery Institute&#x27;s Center for Science and Culture (CSC), and one of the co-founders of the intelligent design movement, along with William Dembski and Michael Behe. Johnson described himself as &quot;in a sense the father of the intelligent design movement&quot;. 

Johnson was an opponent of &quot;fully naturalistic evolution, involving chance mechanisms and natural selection&quot;. Johnson argued that scientists accepted the theory of evolution &quot;before it was rigorously tested, and thereafter used all their authority to convince the public that naturalistic processes are sufficient to produce a human from a bacterium, and a bacterium from a mix of chemicals.&quot; The scientific community considered Johnson&#x27;s defense of intelligent design to be pseudoscientific.

==Biography==

=== Early life and education ===
Johnson was born in Aurora, Illinois, on June 18, 1940. He received a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in English literature from Harvard University in 1961, then studied law at the University of Chicago, where he graduated at the top of his class with a Juris Doctor (J.D.) in 1965. He served as a law clerk for Chief Justice Roger J. Traynor of the California Supreme Court from 1965–1966, then clerked for Chief Justice Earl Warren at the Supreme Court of the United States from 1966–1967. In January 1966, Johnson became a member of the State Bar of California.

=== Career ===
From 1967 to 2000, Johnson was an active professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law and retained the title of professor emeritus at the time of his death. Johnson served as deputy district attorney and held visiting professorships at Emory University and at University College London.

At the age of 38, Johnson became a born again Christian following a divorce, and later became an elder in the Presbyterian Church (USA). Johnson recounted that while on a sabbatical in England he sought, through prayer, inspiration for what he should do with the rest of his life, and then received an epiphany after he read Richard Dawkins&#x27; &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot; (1986) and Michael Denton&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1985). Johnson later said, &quot;Something about the Darwinists&#x27; rhetorical style made me think they had something to hide.&quot; Despite having no formal background in biology, he felt that he could add insight into the premises and arguments. Johnson stated that he approached the creation evolution dispute not as a scientist but as an academic lawyer by profession, with a specialty in analyzing the logic of arguments and identifying the assumptions that lie behind those arguments. He noted that what people think about evolutionism depends very heavily on the kind of logic they employ and the kind of assumptions they make. Further, he pointed out that four of the eleven members of the special committee appointed by the National Academy of Sciences to prepare its official booklet titled Science and Creationism were lawyers. (That first edition of the publication, which was finished in 1984, was prepared as an amicus brief in the &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot; case that went before the U.S. Supreme Court.) In 1989, &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot; by Percival Davis and Dean H. Kenyon was published as the first book to promote intelligent design.

The first edition of &quot;Darwin on Trial&quot; was published in 1991. In notes listing his sources, Johnson said about &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot; that &quot;This book is &#x27;creationist&#x27; only in the sense that it juxtaposes a paradigm of &#x27;intelligent design&#x27; with the dominant paradigm of (naturalistic) evolution, and makes the case for the former. It does not rely on the authority of the Bible.&quot; Following that, Johnson sought supporters for his &quot;Wedge Strategy&quot;.
In the ID blog &quot;Evolution News&quot;, Casey Luskin described him as the godfather of the intelligent design movement, and PBS said he was &quot;known as the father of intelligent design&quot;. 

Johnson was a critic of methodological naturalism, the basic principle that science can only investigate natural causes for observable phenomena, and espoused a philosophy he called &quot;theistic realism.&quot; He was the author of several books on intelligent design, science, philosophy, and religion, as well as textbooks on criminal law. He has appeared on various programs such as PBS&#x27;s &quot;Firing Line&quot; and a &quot;Nova&quot; episode, &quot;Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial.&quot;

=== Personal life and death ===
Beginning in 2001, Johnson suffered a series of minor right brain strokes. His rehabilitations limited his public activities and participation in the debate on intelligent design, because of both their physical effects and Johnson&#x27;s belief that they were signs from God urging him to spend more time with his faith and family and less in prideful debate. In 2004, he was awarded the inaugural &quot;Phillip E. Johnson Award for Liberty and Truth&quot; by Biola University, a private evangelical Christian college noted for its promotion of intelligent design. Johnson had two children and lived with his wife in Berkeley, California.

Johnson died in early November 2019 at his home.

==Intelligent design==

Johnson was known as one of the founders of the intelligent design movement, principal architect of the wedge strategy, and the author of the Santorum Amendment.

Johnson rejects common descent and does not take a position on the age of the Earth. These concepts are a common theme in his books, including &quot;Darwin on Trial,&quot; &quot;Reason in the Balance: The Case Against Naturalism in Science, Law &amp; Education&quot; (1995), &quot;Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds&quot; (1997), and &quot;The Wedge of Truth: Splitting the Foundations of Naturalism&quot; (2000). Eugenie Scott wrote that &quot;Darwin on Trial&quot; &quot;teaches little that is accurate about either the nature of science, or the topic of evolution. It is recommended neither by scientists nor educators.&quot; Working through the Center for Science and Culture, Johnson wrote the early draft language of the Santorum Amendment, which encouraged a &quot;Teach the Controversy&quot; approach to evolution in public school education.

Nancy Pearcey, a Center for Science and Culture fellow and Johnson associate, credits Johnson&#x27;s leadership of the intelligent design movement in two of her most recent publications. In an interview with Johnson for World magazine, Pearcey says, &quot;It is not only in politics that leaders forge movements. Phillip Johnson has developed what is called the &#x27;Intelligent Design&#x27; movement ...&quot; In &quot;Christianity Today&quot;, she reveals Johnson&#x27;s religious beliefs and his criticism of evolution and affirms Johnson as &quot;The unofficial spokesman for ID&quot; The scientific community views intelligent design as unscientific, pseudoscience and junk science.

===Darwin on Trial===

In the book &quot;Darwin on Trial&quot;, 1991, Johnson disputed the tenets of evolution and promoted Intelligent design. He wrote the book with the thesis that evolution could be &quot;tried&quot; like a defendant in court. &quot;Darwin on Trial&quot; became a central text of the intelligent design movement.

===Wedge strategy===

In its earliest days the intelligent design movement was called the &#x27;wedge movement&#x27;. The wedge metaphor, attributed to Johnson, is that of a metal wedge splitting a log and represents using an aggressive public relations program to create an opening for the supernatural in the public&#x27;s understanding of science. Johnson acknowledges that the goal of the intelligent design movement is to promote a theistic agenda as a scientific concept.

According to Johnson, the wedge movement, if not the term, began in 1992:
Rob Boston of Americans United for Separation of Church and State described the wedge strategy:
Johnson is one of the authors of the Discovery Institute&#x27;s Wedge Document and its &quot;Teach the Controversy&quot; campaign, which attempts to cast doubt on the validity of the theory of evolution, its acceptance within the scientific community, and reduce its role in public school science curricula while promoting intelligent design. The &quot;Teach the Controversy&quot; campaign portrays evolution as &quot;a theory in crisis.&quot;

In his 1997 book &quot;Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds&quot; Johnson summed up the underlying philosophy of his advocacy for intelligent design and against methodological and philosophical naturalism:
Johnson has described the wedge strategy as:
* &quot;We are taking an intuition most people have [the belief in God] and making it a scientific and academic enterprise. We are removing the most important cultural roadblock to accepting the role of God as creator.&quot;
* &quot;Our strategy has been to change the subject a bit, so that we can get the issue of intelligent design, which really means the reality of God, before the academic world and into the schools.&quot;
* &quot;This isn&#x27;t really, and never has been, a debate about science. It&#x27;s about religion and philosophy.&quot;
* &quot;So the question is: &#x27;How to win?&#x27; That&#x27;s when I began to develop what you now see full-fledged in the &#x27;wedge&#x27; strategy: &#x27;Stick with the most important thing&#x27; —the mechanism and the building up of information. Get the Bible and the Book of Genesis out of the debate because you do not want to raise the so-called Bible-science dichotomy. Phrase the argument in such a way that you can get it heard in the secular academy and in a way that tends to unify the religious dissenters. That means concentrating on, &#x27;Do you need a Creator to do the creating, or can nature do it on its own?&#x27; and refusing to get sidetracked onto other issues, which people are always trying to do.&quot;

When asked how best to raise doubts and question evolution with non-believers, Johnson responded:
===Wedge of Truth===

The book &quot;Wedge of Truth&quot;, published by Johnson in 2000, is an expansion of the Wedge Document. He states that truth has the ability to speak for itself.

===Criticism===
Johnson has been accused of being intellectually dishonest in his arguments advancing intelligent design and attacking the scientific community. Johnson has employed numerous equivocations regarding the term &quot;naturalism,&quot; failing to distinguish between methodological naturalism (in which science is used to study the natural world and says nothing about the supernatural) versus philosophical naturalism (the philosophical belief that nothing exists but the natural world, and adopts as a premise the idea that there is no supernatural world or deities). In fact-checking Johnson&#x27;s books &quot;Darwin on Trial&quot; and &quot;Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds&quot;, Brian Spitzer, an associate professor of biology at the University of Redlands, argued that almost every scientific source Johnson cited had been misused or distorted, from simple misinterpretations and innuendos to outright fabrications. Spitzer described &quot;Darwin on Trial&quot; as the most deceptive book he had ever read.

In 1993 the ASA&#x27;s &quot;Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith&quot; published a review of &quot;Darwin on Trial&quot; by Nancey Murphy, an associate professor of Christian philosophy at Fuller Theological Seminary, who described Johnson&#x27;s arguments as &quot;dogmatic and unconvincing&quot;, primarily because &quot;he does not adequately understand scientific reasoning.&quot;
In a later interview she said she faced a campaign to get her fired after she expressed her view that intelligent design was not only poor theology, but &quot;so stupid, I don&#x27;t want to give them my time.&quot; Murphy, who accepts the validity of evolution, said that Johnson called a trustee in an attempt to get her fired and stated &quot;His tactic has always been to fight dirty when anyone attacks his ideas.&quot; Johnson admits he had spoken with a former trustee of the seminary who was himself upset with Murphy, but denies any responsibility for action taken against her. He said: &quot;It&#x27;s the Darwinists who hold the power in academia and who threaten the professional status and livelihoods of anyone who disagrees ... They feel to teach anything but their orthodoxy is an act of professional treason.&quot;

Since Johnson is considered by those both inside and outside the movement to be the father and architect of the intelligent design movement and its strategies, his statements are often used to validate the criticisms leveled by those who allege that the Discovery Institute and its allied organizations are merely stripping the obvious religious content from their anti-evolution assertions as a means of avoiding the legal restrictions of the Establishment Clause, a view reinforced by the December 2005 ruling in the &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot; trial which found that intelligent design is not science and is essentially religious in nature. They argue that ID is an attempt to put a patina of secularity on top of what is a fundamentally religious belief and thus that the &quot;Teach the Controversy&quot; exhortation is disingenuous, particularly when contrasted to his statements in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and other secular media. Critics point out that contrary to the Discovery Institute&#x27;s and Johnson&#x27;s claims, the theory of evolution is well-supported and accepted within the scientific community, with debates regarding &quot;how&quot; evolution occurred, not &quot;if&quot; it occurred. Popular disagreement with evolutionary theory should not be considered as a reason for challenging it as a scientifically valid subject to be taught, they contend.

Critics of Johnson point to his central role in the Discovery Institute&#x27;s carefully orchestrated campaign known as the wedge strategy. The wedge strategy, as envisioned by the Discovery Institute, is designed to leave the science establishment looking close-minded in the short term with a long-term goal being a redefinition of science that centers on the removal of methodological naturalism from the philosophy of science and the scientific method, thereby allowing for supernatural explanations to be introduced as science. Critics note that Johnson, as a principal officer of the Discovery Institute, often cites an overall plan to put the United States on a course toward the theocracy envisioned in the wedge strategy, and that the Discovery Institute as a matter of policy intentionally obfuscates its agenda. According to Johnson, &quot;The movement we now call the wedge made its public debut at a conference of scientists and philosophers held at Southern Methodist University in March 1992.&quot;

During the 1990s, Johnson and several others challenged the scientific consensus by claiming that HIV tests do not detect HIV, AIDS statistics are grossly exaggerated, and that HIV is not the cause of AIDS. As a member of The Group for the Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV/AIDS Hypothesis, a prominent AIDS denialist group, Johnson questioned if HIV caused AIDS. He wrote several articles about the subject, including a piece in &quot;Reason&quot; magazine. He was one of the 12 founding members of The Group for the Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV/AIDS Hypothesis and signatory to the group&#x27;s letter to the editor of &quot;Science&quot; asserting that HIV is only tautologically associated with AIDS and that HIV tests are inaccurate. Johnson, along with others, have been criticized for their questioning of the scientific and medical consensus that HIV causes AIDS. In the &quot;Washington University Law Review&quot;, Matthew J. Brauer, Barbara Forrest, and Steven G. Gey faulted Johnson, Wells and others for denying the HIV/AIDS connection and promoting denialism via a petition designed to garner publicity but which did not have any scientific support.

<doc id="261310" wikidata="Q383056" url="?curid=261310" title="Economies of agglomeration">
<text>One of the major subfields of urban economics, economies of agglomeration (or agglomeration effects), explains, in broad terms, how urban agglomeration occurs in locations where cost savings can naturally arise. This term is most often discussed in terms of economic firm productivity. However, agglomeration effects also explain some social phenomena, such as large proportions of the population being clustered in cities and major urban centers. Similar to economies of scale, the costs and benefits of agglomerating increase the larger the agglomerated urban cluster becomes. Several prominent examples of where agglomeration has brought together firms of a specific industry are: Silicon Valley and Los Angeles being hubs of technology and entertainment, respectively, in California, United States along with London, United Kingdom, being a hub of finance.

Economies of agglomeration have some advantages. As more firms in related fields of business cluster together, their production costs tend to decline significantly (firms have multiple competing suppliers; greater specialization and division of labor). Even when competing firms in the same sector cluster, there may be advantages because the cluster attracts more suppliers and customers than a single firm could achieve alone. Cities form and grow to exploit economies of agglomeration.

Diseconomies of agglomeration are the opposite. For example, spatially concentrated growth in automobile-oriented fields may create problems of crowding and traffic congestion. The tension between economies and diseconomies allows cities to grow but keeps them from becoming too large.

At the foundational level, proximity—especially to other facilities and suppliers—is a driving force behind economic growth and is one explanation for why agglomeration effects are so evident in major urban centers. While the concentration of economic activity in cities has a positive effect on their development and growth, cities, in turn, help foster economic activity by accommodating population growth, driving wage increases, and facilitating technological change.

== Advantages of agglomeration==
When firms form clusters of economic activity, particular development strategies flow into and throughout this area of economic activity. This helps accumulate information and the flow of new and innovative ideas among firms to achieve what economists call increasing returns to scale. Increasing returns to scale are &quot;internal&quot; economies of scale for a firm and may allow for establishing more of the same firm outside the area or region. Economies of scale &quot;external&quot; to a firm result from spatial proximity and are called agglomeration economies of scale. Agglomeration economies can be seen as the external condition for companies and the internal condition for the region.

Increasing returns to scale, according to Beckmann, is integral to understanding why urban centers form. These increasing returns to scale &quot;give rise to [urban systems],&quot; capturing &quot;the trade-off between transportation costs and economies of scale&quot;. Agglomeration economies exist when production is cheaper because of this clustering of economic activity. As a result of this clustering, it becomes possible to establish other businesses that may take advantage of these economies without joining any big organization.
This process may help to urbanize areas as well.

Benefits arise from the spatial agglomeration of physical capital, companies, consumers, and workers:
* &quot;Low transport costs:&quot; Physical proximity to other firms and centers of production can minimize costs associated with transportation. While this may have been the case for many manufacturing firms in the United States, Glaeser and Gottlieb argue that reducing transportation costs is more important for firms producing services. Moreover, other studies have shown that when negative externalities like pollution are taken into account, agglomerated city centers are more likely to be dispersed over a larger geographical area rather than be confined to a single, metropolis-like urban region.
* &quot;Geographic advantages:&quot; A longstanding theory in urban economic literature is that firms (and cities) are likely to agglomerate where there are natural geographic advantages, which would give these firms both comparative and cost advantages over their competitors. Ellison and Glaeser argue that while this may be true for firms whose location decisions are highly sensitive to cost differences or geographic locations, such as the wine industry, they find that only 20% of geographic agglomeration effects in the United States can be explained by &quot;natural&quot; cost advantages.
* &quot;Labor pooling and matching:&quot; Agglomerating effects, such as an increase in population and therefore, human capital, arguably help improve matching within the economy, e.g. employees with employers, suppliers with buyers, and so on. Moreover, massive urban areas like cities, which contain a multitude of industries in a localized area, can help firms offset their reaction to shocks more efficiently by &#x27;pooling&#x27; labor resources together.
* &quot;Knowledge spillovers:&quot; the accumulation of knowledge and human capital in concentrated areas like major urban centers can contribute to the sharing of production technologies (i.e., know-how) between firms. Econometric analysis by Liang and Goetz showed that agglomeration effects account for technology-intensive industries benefiting from Jacobs-type knowledge spillovers. Furthermore, agglomerated centres of production, like cities, also facilitate learning—that is, knowledge generation, diffusion, and accumulation—on a larger scale than smaller economic regions.

== Disadvantages of agglomeration==

While the existence of cities can only persist if the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, poorly planned agglomerations may also lead to negative externalities like traffic congestion (lack of walkability and public transport) or pollution (lack of environmental protection laws). These adverse effects can cause diseconomies of scale. Another source of agglomeration diseconomies—higher crowding and increased waiting time—can be observed in disciplines or industries that are characterized by constrained access to relevant production facilities or resources. As stated above, these factors are what decrease the pricing power of firms because of the many competitors in the area, as well as a shortage of labor and a lack of flexibility among firms for the laborers abound. Large cities experience these problems, and this tension between agglomeration economies and agglomeration dis-economies may contribute to the area&#x27;s growth, control the growth of the area, or cause the area to experience a lack of growth.

The economies of agglomeration have also been shown to increase inequality both within urban areas and between urban and rural areas. The Oxford development economist Paul Collier proposed that the gains of agglomeration should be taxed as rents, which leads to behavior-distorting rent-seeking (Henry George theorem). This would be ethical and efficient in that gains would be better aligned with deserts, and rent-seeking would be curbed. Collier recommended a tax calculated by combining high-income and metropolitan locations, which can then be redistributed to other cities that have been hard hit by agglomeration.

The disadvantages of agglomerations are to be mentioned:

* &quot;For the environment:&quot; The high level of economic agglomeration is probably the cause of environmental pollution, including air pollution, water pollution, land pollution, etc. One example is the economic agglomeration in the Yangtze River Delta region in China. Because of the concentration of individuals and industry, the serious air pollution in the Yangtze River Delta has not only caused some extreme weather problems but has also increased some diseases. Adjusting the city’s spatial structure can alleviate environmental problems and release environmental pressures. Energy consumption is another environmental problem. The agglomeration of the economy led to a rapid increase in population and industries, which caused serious energy problems. It also resulted in pollution and raised the demands for more advanced production technology.
* &quot;Economic:&quot; Economic agglomeration can create some economic benefits but also tends to widen the disparity between rich areas and poor areas and increase interregional inequality. Interregional inequality cannot be prevented because it is a necessary stage during economic development. The serious inequality problem even causes issues of social instability and political uncertainty. Governments need to improve equality by doing activities such as investing in human capital and innovation. Economic agglomeration may also affect rural areas. The over-agglomeration in the city would affect agricultural production and cause unemployment problems.
* &quot;For society:&quot; Economic agglomeration has also caused social problems. First, the increased population has led to high land prices. To reduce the inequality problem, governments may tax the land in the agglomeration area, increasing the land price. Second, the agglomeration of the economy also creates a high demand for infrastructure. It is important to coordinate the public goods problem, find the best volume of public contribution, and prevent poor or overburdened infrastructure.
* &quot;For companies:&quot; Economic agglomeration would cause fierce competitive pressure. Competition can reduce the market price, motivating companies to innovate and increase production efficiency. However, over-competition would hinder companies&#x27; development and innovation, and would also generate some social problems.

== Types of economies ==

Two types of economies are considered large-scale and have external economies of scale: localization and urbanization economies. Localization economies arise from many firms in the same industry located close to each other. There are three benefits of localization economies: The first is the benefit of labor pooling, which is the accessibility that firms have to a variety of skilled laborers, which in turn provides employment opportunities for the laborers. The second benefit is the development of industries due to the increasing returns to scale in intermediate inputs for a product. The third benefit is the relative ease of communication and exchange of supplies, laborers, and innovative ideas due to the proximity among firms.

== Core-periphery model ==

While localization and urbanization economies and their benefits are crucial to sustaining agglomeration economies and cities, it is important to understand the long-term result of the function of agglomeration economies, which relates to the core-periphery model. The core-periphery model features an amount of economic activity in one main area surrounded by a remote area of less dense activity. The concentration of this economic activity in one area (usually a city center) allows for the growth and expansion of activity into other and surrounding areas because of the cost-minimizing location decisions of firms within these agglomeration economies to sustain high productivity and advantages, which therefore allow them to grow outside of the city (core) and into the periphery. A small decrease in the fixed cost of production can increase the range of locations for further establishment of firms, leading to loss of concentration in the city and possibly the development of a new city outside the original city where agglomeration and increasing returns to scale existed.

If localization economies were the main factor contributing to why cities exist with the exclusion of urbanization economies, then it would make sense for each firm in the same industry to form its city. However, in a more realistic sense, cities are more complex than that, which is why the combination of localization and urbanization economies forms large cities.

== Source of economies ==

From the localization of firms, labor market pooling emerges. Large populations of skilled laborers enter the area and can exchange knowledge, ideas, and information. The more firms there are in this area, the greater the competition is to obtain workers, resulting in higher wages for the workers. However, the fewer firms there are and the more workers there are at a location the lower the wages for those workers will be.

The second contribution to localization economies is the access to specialized goods and services provided for clustering firms. This access to specialized goods and services is known as an intermediate input. It provides increasing returns on scale for each of the firms located within that area because of the proximity to available sources needed for production. If intermediate inputs are tradable, a core-periphery notion will have many firms located near each other to be closer to their required sources. If there are tradable resources and services nearby but no related industries in the same area, then in that case, there are no networking linkages, which makes it difficult for all firms in the area to obtain resources and increase production. The decreased transportation costs associated with the clustering of firms lead to an increase in the likelihood of a core-periphery pattern; the result will be that more intermediate inputs will be focused at the core and, therefore, will attract more firms in related industries.

The third source relating to localization economies is technological spillovers. One final advantage of this source is that clustering in specific fields leads to quicker diffusion or adoption of ideas. For production to be at its maximum and for firms to sell their products, they require some feasible access to capital markets. New forms of technology can create problems and involve risk; the clustering of firms creates an advantage to reduce the uncertainty and complications involved with using new technology through information flow. The capital flow and technology industry are concentrated within specific areas, and therefore, it is to the advantage of the firm to locate near these areas. This technological impact, specifically in the communications field, will provide and dismiss the barrier between firms in the same industry located further away and nearby, leading to a greater concentration of information flow and economic production and activity. Furthermore, technological spillovers may be more beneficial to smaller cities in terms of their growth than larger cities because of the existing informational networks that already helped them form and grow.

<text>Juan Vicente Gómez Chacón (24 July 1857 – 17 December 1935) was a Venezuelan military general, politician and &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Venezuela from 1908 until his death in 1935. He only officially served as president on three occasions during this time, ruling as an unelected military strongman behind puppet governments in between.

Important public works were carried out during his dictatorship. He founded the country&#x27;s first airline, Aeropostal Alas de Venezuela and the Venezuelan Air Force. He commissioned the construction of Venezuela&#x27;s first airports: Maracaibo International Airport &quot;Grano de Oro&quot;, La Fría, Encontrados, Sucre Base (now Florencio Gomez National Airport in Maracay, Aragua), Aragua Meteorological Air Base (the cradle and birthplace of the airport). Venezuelan Aviation, later converted into Aviation Museum), Porlamar (now Municipal Police Headquarters, replaced by Santiago Mariño Caribbean International Airport), Leonardo Chirinos International Airport in Coro, Juan Vicente Gómez International Airport and Mérida&#x27;s Alberto Carnevalli Airport.

Likewise, bridges, customs buildings (such as the main customs office in San Antonio del Táchira), the first passenger terminal of the intercity bus line were built, the first intercity bus line was called the Venezuelan Airbus or the Venezuelan Airmail Bus. The famous Transandean Highway was also built, a route that starts from Las Adjuntas station (near Caracas Metro Station) and ends at the main land customs office in San Antonio del Táchira. The Venezuelan military was organized on a modern basis. This development came at the expense of civil liberties. Opposition was suppressed when it arose, often brutally. Additionally, much of the country&#x27;s wealth wound up in the hands of Gómez and his cronies.

Despite being considered a cruel tyrant who killed countless people, his dictatorship always tried to maintain a constitutional and democratic façade, employing short-term puppet presidents like Victorino Márquez Bustillos and Juan Bautista Pérez, and allowing them to rule directly or indirectly through successive constitutional amendments.

==Early years==
Gómez was born into a prominent family of Andean landowners who lived in the La Mulera. He was the firstborn son of Pedro Cornelio Gomez and Hermenegilda Chacon Alarcon. In 1899, he joined the private army of Cipriano Castro, with whom he had been friends since Castro&#x27;s exile in Colombia. This army swept down on Caracas in 1899 and seized control of the country. He became Castro&#x27;s vice president and, in 1902, head of the military, responsible for suppressing several major revolts against the government in the battle of Ciudad Bolivar on 21 July 1903. Gómez seized power from Castro in a coup d&#x27;état on 19 December 1908, while Castro was in Europe for medical treatment.

==Presidency==


As president, Gómez managed to deflate Venezuela&#x27;s staggering debt by granting concessions to foreign oil companies after the discovery of petroleum in Lake Maracaibo in 1914. This, in turn, won him the support of the United States and Europe and economic stability. Though he used the money to launch an extensive public works program, he also received generous kickbacks, increasing his personal fortune enormously. Because of his contributions to the country&#x27;s development, the Congress bestowed the title of &quot;El Benemérito&quot; (&quot;the Meritorious One&quot;) on him. In contrast, his opponents, who disdained his brutal tactics at home, referred to him as &quot;El Bagre&quot; (&quot;the Catfish&quot;), a snide reference to his bushy mustache and outward appearance. They also called him &quot;the Tyrant of the Andes&quot; – a reference to his roots in the mountain state of Táchira.

Gómez spent the last year of his term on a military campaign, and José Gil Fortoul served as &quot;de facto&quot; acting president. Gómez was reelected in 1914, but declined to take office, and Victorino Márquez was elected provisional president in his stead. It was generally understood, however, that Gómez continued to hold the real power; he ruled the country from his home in Maracay. He returned to office in 1922, ruling until 22 April 1929. Though he was reelected by Congress, he declined to return to the capital, and Juan Bautista Pérez assumed the presidency, though Gómez remained the final authority in the country. On 13 June 1931, Congress forced Pérez to resign, and elected Gómez president again. This time, he resumed office, ruling the country until his death.

==Opposition==
The Generation of 1928 was a group of students who led protests in 1928 against Gómez in the capital city of Caracas. Members included Rómulo Betancourt, Jóvito Villalba, Joaquin Gabaldon Marquez, Juan Oropeza, Raúl Leoni, Andrés Eloy Blanco, Miguel Otero Silva, Pedro Sotillo, Isaac J Pardo, Juan Bautista Fuenmayor, Germán Suárez Flamerich, and Gustavo Machado.

==Personal life==
Gómez was never married; however, he had two mistresses. The first one was Dionisia Gómez Bello, with whom he had seven children: José Vicente, Josefa, Alí, Flor de María, Graciela, Servilia, and Gonzalo. The second one was Dolores Amelia Nunez Linares&#x27; de Cáceres, with whom he had nine children: Juan Vicente, Florencio, Rosa Amelia, Hermenegilda, Cristina, Belén, Berta, Manuel Antonio and Juan Crisóstomo Gómez. Gómez also fathered many other children in brief relationships: at least 64 and possibly as many as 99. He appointed many of his children to public office, sparking charges of nepotism.

Gómez did not drink or smoke.

== Legacy ==

Gómez&#x27;s rule of Venezuela is a controversial period in the country&#x27;s history. His leadership brought enrichment to the country, particularly after the discovery of oil, which enabled the development of a modern infrastructure. His insistence on road construction and the creation of jobs in the then-new oil industry promoted population mobility and more frequent social contact among Venezuelans of different regions – previously a rare occurrence – which permanently rooted a sense of national unity in the country. He brought about the end of civil wars and political insurrections by exerting power over regional caudillos to strengthen his own power, and as a result, Venezuela became a peaceful country for several decades. Ironically, the elimination of the caudillo problem and the choosing of Eleazar López Contreras as his last minister of war and marine paved the way to the emergence of modern democracy; see Generation of 1928. He repaid all foreign and internal debt using excess reserves; his fiscal conservatism helped the country get through the Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression, and led to an increase in the value of the bolívar to the point of becoming hard currency.

On the other hand, he is considered by some as one of the prominent examples of U.S. economic domination over Latin America. During his reign, most of the country&#x27;s wealth ended up in the hands of Gómez and his cronies, and, according to Woddis, Wall Street. Indeed, at the time of his death, he was by far the richest man in the country. While he brought more peace and prosperity than most living Venezuelans had known, it came at the expense of democracy. He held basic civil liberties in disdain, and his secret police were ubiquitous. He also did little for public education (believing that &quot;an ignorant people is a docile people&quot;). Although cordial and simple in manner and speech, his ruthless crushing of opponents through his secret police earned him the reputation of a tyrant. He was also accused of trying to make the country his personal fiefdom.

Under Gómez, Venezuela completed a degree of independence and financial progress. After oil become determined close to Lake Maracaibo in 1914, Gómez bargained shrewdly with the petroleum corporations of the United States, United Kingdom, and the Netherlands for the gain of Venezuela. He persevered to preserve precise family members with overseas countries and controlled to cast off all overseas indebtedness. He exercised control over the neighborhood caudillos (&quot;bosses&quot;) and the Roman Catholic Church, launched many public works programs, and prepared a &#x27;green&#x27; administration. A staunch anticommunist, Gómez viewed both communism and trade unions as a threat to regime and suppressed both, denouncing the former as a &quot;plague&quot; and the latter as &quot;a tool of the devil.&quot;

John Gunther described Gómez as follows: &quot;The Catfish was—let us not gloss over the fact—a murderous blackguard. He made use of tortures of inconceivable brutality; political prisoners, of which there were thousands, dragged out their lives bearing leg irons (&quot;grillos&quot;) that made them permanent cripples, if they were not hung upside down—by the testicles—until they died. Others became human slime, literally. Gómez was quite capable of choosing one out of every ten by lot, and hanging them—&quot;by meathooks through their throats!&quot;&quot; (Emphasis in the original.)

Former Venezuelan President Rómulo Betancourt said in his book &quot;Venezuela: Oil and Politics&quot; that &quot;(...) Gomez was something more than a local despot, he was the instrument of foreign control of the Venezuelan economy, the ally and servant of powerful outside interests.&quot; This is in reference to Royal Dutch Shell and Standard Oil&#x27;s appeasement of the dictator in return for exploration rights to the country&#x27;s oil fields.

In Venezuelan politics, Juan Vicente Gómez has come to symbolize political endurance and a right-wing caudillo mentality together with Marcos Pérez Jiménez. Gómez was quoted as saying he needed a lifetime to fulfill his political work.

Juan Vicente Gómez International Airport was named for him in 1993.

<doc id="261313" wikidata="Q1420932" url="?curid=261313" title="Maso Yamazaki">
<text>, better known by his stage name Masonna, is a Japanese noise musician. He was born on November 16, 1966, in Miyazu, Kyoto, Japan.

 was started in 1987 in Osaka as Maso Yamazaki&#x27;s noise project. The name is a combination of the Japanese words and . It is also a pun on the name of the pop singer Madonna. The name is sometimes rendered as an acronym for or Mystic Another Selection Of Nurses Naked Anthology.

Maso also performs as Space Machine using vintage analog synthesizers. He has performed with the psychedelic rock group Christine 23 Onna (with Fusao Toda of Angel&#x27;in Heavy Syrup), which then became Acid Eater with the addition of two members, as well as the noise supergroup Bustmonster and the noise trio Flying Testicle.

In 2018, Maso began performing and releasing under the name Controlled Death and in 2025 Maso started releasing under the name Ja a ku yamiizu lu

==History==
Maso has said that he became interested in making noise music when he heard the sounds of destruction on television as a child, but that his first exposure to the Japanese noise genre was Hanatarash&#x27;s debut LP, which at the time did not impress Maso. It was however later, upon happening on an LP entitled &quot;LSD&quot; by a Tokyo noise band named Nord, and mistakenly thinking it was an album by the band LSD, that these experiences had possibly kindled his future interest. A year thereafter Maso sought many different types of noise releases in the underground music stores in and around Osaka Japan. Two years would pass until Maso would start to develop his own style of noise and begin producing, at which time he quit listening to the noise albums of others and focused in on his own unique style. Previous to his interest in noise Maso played guitar in several bands, one of which he states in interviews was a Led Zeppelin cover band, playing the occasional Deep Purple song.

All of Maso&#x27;s projects draw heavily from the psychedelic music scene in outward style, but sonically most of them resemble very few of the traits of late 1960s and 1970s psychedelic music. Maso has an interest in avant-garde films, having stated in interviews that his two favorite movies are the Alexandro Jodorowsky films &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot; and &quot;El Topo&quot;. He also claims to admire and had the wish to have worked with American musician Captain Beefheart.

The Masonna project has been the opening act for several well-known artists on their Japanese concert dates, including Sonic Youth, Beck and Slipknot. Masonna also caught the attention of John Peel and was featured on his program, having even done a limited Masonna &quot;John Peel Sessions&quot; CD.

Masonna is most known for Yamazaki&#x27;s wild live performances which usually consist of damaging his equipment, jumping around madly, and at times getting injured. He has given entire concerts which last only a few seconds. In 1996 Masonna toured the United States on the &quot;American Mystique Tour&quot; named after his album &quot;Inner Mind Mystique&quot;.

Maso was also the manager of Jojo Hiroshige&#x27;s Alchemy Music Store until its closure.

<text>An energy crisis or energy shortage is any significant bottleneck in the supply of energy resources to an economy. In literature, it often refers to one of the energy sources used at a certain time and place, in particular, those that supply national electricity grids or those used as fuel in industrial development. Population growth has led to a surge in the global demand for energy in recent years. In the 2000s, this new demand – together with Middle East tension, the falling value of the US dollar, dwindling oil reserves, concerns over peak oil, and oil price speculation – triggered the 2000s energy crisis, which saw the price of oil reach an all-time high of in 2008.

Most energy crises have been caused by localized shortages, wars and market manipulation. However, the recent historical energy crises listed below were not caused by such factors.

== Causes ==

Most energy crises have been caused by localized shortages, wars and market manipulation. Some have argued that government actions like tax hikes, nationalisation of energy companies, and regulation of the energy sector shift supply and demand of energy away from its economic equilibrium. However, the recent historical energy crises listed below were not caused by such factors. Market failure is possible when monopoly manipulation of markets occurs. A crisis can develop due to industrial actions like union organized strikes or government embargoes. The cause may be over-consumption, aging infrastructure, choke point disruption, or bottlenecks at oil refineries or port facilities that restrict fuel supply. An emergency may emerge during very cold winters due to increased consumption of energy.

Large fluctuations and manipulations in future derivatives can impact price. Investment banks trade 80% of oil derivatives as of May 2012, compared to 30% a decade ago. This consolidation of trade contributed to an improvement of global energy output from 117,687 TWh in 2000 to 143,851 TWh in 2008. Limitations on free trade for derivatives could reverse this trend of growth in energy production. Kuwaiti Oil Minister Hani Hussein stated that &quot;Under the supply and demand theory, oil prices today are not justified,&quot; in an interview with Upstream.

Pipeline failures and other accidents may cause minor interruptions to energy supplies. A crisis could possibly emerge after infrastructure damage from severe weather. Attacks by terrorists or militia on important infrastructure are a possible problem for energy consumers, with a successful strike on a Middle East facility potentially causing global shortages. Political events, for example, when governments change due to regime change, monarchy collapse, military occupation, and coup may disrupt oil and gas production and create shortages. Fuel shortage can also be due to the excess and useless use of the fuels.

== Historical crises ==
* North Korea has had energy shortages for many years.
* Zimbabwe has experienced a shortage of energy supplies for many years due to financial mismanagement.

===20th century===
* 1970s energy crisis – caused by the peaking of oil production in major industrial nations (Germany, United States, Canada, etc.) and embargoes from other producers
** 1973 oil crisis – caused by an OAPEC oil export embargo by many of the major Arab oil-producing states, in response to Western support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War
** 1979 oil crisis – caused by the Iranian Revolution
* 1990 oil price shock – caused by the Gulf War

===2000s===
* 2000 fuel protests in the United Kingdom in 2000 were caused by a rise in the price of crude oil combined with already relatively high taxation on road fuel in the UK.
* 2000s energy crisis – Since 2003, a rise in prices caused by continued global increases in petroleum demand coupled with production stagnation, the falling value of the US dollar, and a myriad of other secondary causes.
* 2000–2001 California electricity crisis – Caused by market manipulation by Enron and failed deregulation; resulted in multiple large-scale power outages
* 2000–2008 North American natural gas crisis
* 2004 energy crisis in Argentina
* 2005, 2008 China experienced severe energy shortages towards the end of 2005 and again in early 2008. During the latter crisis they suffered severe damage to power networks along with diesel and coal shortages. Supplies of electricity in Guangdong province, the manufacturing hub of China, are predicted to fall short by an estimated 10 GW. In 2011 China was forecast to have a second quarter electrical power deficit of 44.85 – 49.85 GW.
* 2007 Political riots occurring during the 2007 Burmese anti-government protests were sparked by rising energy prices.

* 2008 energy crisis in Central Asia, caused by abnormally cold temperatures and low water levels in an area dependent on hydroelectric power. At the same time the South African President was appeasing fears of a prolonged electricity crisis in South Africa.
* 2008. In February, the President of Pakistan announced plans to tackle energy shortages that were reaching crisis stage, despite having significant hydrocarbon reserves. In April 2010, the Pakistani government announced the Pakistan national energy policy, which extended the official weekend and banned neon lights in response to a growing electricity shortage.
* 2008 South African energy crisis. The South African crisis led to large price rises for platinum in February 2008 and reduced gold production. and continues as of 2023.

===2010s===
* 2012 United Kingdom fuel crisis
* 2015 – Nepal experienced a major energy crisis in 2015 when India imposed an economic blockade on Nepal. Nepal faced shortages of various kinds of petroleum products and food materials which severely affected Nepal&#x27;s economy.
* 2017 – The Gaza electricity crisis is a result of the tensions between Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, and the Palestinian Authority/Fatah, which rules the West Bank over custom tax revenue, funding of the Gaza Strip, and political authority. Residents receive electricity for a few hours a day on a rolling blackout schedule.
* 2019 California energy crisis

===2020s===

* 2021 Texas power crisis
* 2021 United Kingdom natural gas supplier crisis and 2021 United Kingdom fuel supply crisis
* 2021 global energy crisis. The record-high energy prices were driven by a global surge in demand as the world quit the economic recession caused by COVID-19 pandemic, particularly due to strong energy demand in Asia.
* The Lebanese liquidity crisis lead to shortages of fuel for electricity plants, resulting in the 2021 Lebanese blackout and public utilities being able to offer power for only a few hours a day.
* Ukrainian energy crisis
*Iranian energy crisis

==Emerging oil shortage==

&quot;Peak oil&quot; is the period when the maximum rate of global petroleum extraction is reached, after which the rate of production enters terminal decline. It relates to a long-term decline in the available supply of petroleum. This, combined with increasing demand, significantly increases the worldwide prices of petroleum-derived products. Most significant is the availability and price of liquid fuel for transportation.

The US Department of Energy in the Hirsch report indicates that &quot;The problems associated with world oil production peaking will not be temporary, and past &#x27;energy crisis&#x27; experience will provide relatively little guidance.&quot;

===Mitigation efforts===

To avoid the serious social and economic implications a global decline in oil production could entail, the 2005 Hirsch report emphasized the need to find alternatives, at least ten to twenty years before the peak, and to phase out the use of petroleum over that time. Such mitigation could include energy conservation, fuel substitution, and the use of unconventional oil. Because mitigation can reduce the use of traditional petroleum sources, it can also affect the timing of peak oil and the shape of the Hubbert curve.

Energy policy may be reformed leading to greater energy intensity, for example in Iran with the 2007 Gas Rationing Plan in Iran, Canada and the National Energy Program and in the US with the &quot;Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007&quot; also called the &quot;Clean Energy Act of 2007&quot;. Another mitigation measure is the setup of a cache of secure fuel reserves like the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve, in case of national emergency. Chinese energy policy includes specific targets within their 5-year plans.

Andrew McKillop has been a proponent of a contract and converge model or capping scheme, to mitigate both emissions of greenhouse gases and a peak oil crisis. The imposition of a carbon tax would have mitigating effects on an oil crisis. The Oil Depletion Protocol has been developed by Richard Heinberg to implement a powerdown during a peak oil crisis. While many sustainable development and energy policy organisations have advocated reforms to energy development from the 1970s, some cater to a specific crisis in energy supply including Energy-Quest and the International Association for Energy Economics. The Oil Depletion Analysis Centre and the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas examine the timing and likely effects of peak oil.

Ecologist William Rees believes that
Due to a lack of political viability on the issue, government-mandated fuel prices hikes are unlikely and the unresolved dilemma of fossil fuel dependence is becoming a wicked problem. A global soft energy path seems improbable, due to the rebound effect. Conclusions that the world is heading towards an unprecedented large and potentially devastating global energy crisis due to a decline in the availability of cheap oil lead to calls for a decreasing dependency on fossil fuel.

Other ideas concentrate on design and development of improved, energy-efficient urban infrastructure in developing nations. Government funding for alternative energy is more likely to increase during an energy crisis, so too are incentives for oil exploration. For example, funding for research into inertial confinement fusion technology increased during the 1970s.

Kirk Sorensen and others have suggested that additional nuclear power plants, particularly liquid fluoride thorium reactors have the energy density to mitigate global warming and replace the energy from peak oil, peak coal and peak gas. The reactors produce electricity and heat so much of the transportation infrastructure should move over to electric vehicles. However, the high process heat of the molten salt reactors could be used to make liquid fuels from any carbon source.

== Social and economic effects ==

The macroeconomic implications of a supply shock-induced energy crisis are large, because energy is the resource used to exploit all other resources. Oil price shocks can affect the rest of the economy through delayed business investment, sectoral shifts in the labor market, or monetary policy responses. When energy markets fail, an energy shortage develops. Electricity consumers may experience intentionally engineered rolling blackouts during periods of insufficient supply or unexpected power outages, regardless of the cause.

Industrialized nations are dependent on oil, and efforts to restrict the supply of oil would have an adverse effect on the economies of oil producers. For the consumer, the price of natural gas, gasoline (petrol) and diesel for cars and other vehicles rises. An early response from stakeholders is the call for reports, investigations and commissions into the price of fuels. There are also movements towards the development of more sustainable urban infrastructure.

In the market, new technology and energy efficiency measures become desirable for consumers seeking to decrease transport costs. Examples include:
* In 1980 Briggs &amp; Stratton developed the first gasoline hybrid electric automobile; also appearing are plug-in hybrids.
* the growth of advanced biofuels.
* innovations like the Dahon, a folding bicycle
* modernized and electrifying passenger transport
* Railway electrification systems and new engines such as the Ganz-Mavag locomotive
* variable compression ratio for vehicles

Other responses include the development of unconventional oil sources such as synthetic fuel from places like the Athabasca Oil Sands, more renewable energy commercialization and use of alternative propulsion. There may be a relocation trend towards local foods and possibly microgeneration, solar thermal collectors and other green energy sources.

Tourism trends and gas-guzzler ownership varies with fuel costs. Energy shortages can influence public opinion on subjects from nuclear power plants to electric blankets. Building construction techniques—improved insulation, reflective roofs, thermally efficient windows, etc.—change to reduce heating costs.
The percentage of businesses indicating that energy prices represent a barrier to investment has increased in 2022 (82%) as found in recent surveys, particularly for those who see it as a significant obstacle (59%). According to varied energy prices and energy intensity across nations and industries, various countries have different percentages of businesses that view energy costs as a key obstacle, ranging from 24% in Finland to 81% in Greece for example.

=== Crisis management ===

An electricity shortage is felt most acutely in heating, cooking, and water supply. Therefore, a sustained energy crisis may become a humanitarian crisis.
If an energy shortage is prolonged a crisis management phase is enforced by authorities. Energy audits may be conducted to monitor usage. Various curfews with the intention of increasing energy conservation may be initiated to reduce consumption. For example, to conserve power during the Central Asia energy crisis, authorities in Tajikistan ordered bars and cafes to operate by candlelight.

In the worst kind of energy crisis energy rationing and fuel rationing may be incurred. Panic buying may beset outlets as awareness of shortages spread. Facilities close down to save on heating oil; and factories cut production and lay off workers. The risk of stagflation increases.

<text>Transport finance is the subject that explores how transport networks are paid for.

The timing of the money required to finance transport is a principal issue. Many projects are &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot;, that is infrastructure, which lasts many years, is expected to be paid out of ongoing cash flow. Other projects are financed with bonds raised in capital markets. Bonds must be secured with an expected future cash flow.

The cash flow, required for either pay-as-you-go or for bonds, must be raised. Common sources are user fees, such as gas taxes, and tolls. Other sources are general revenue. This issue is related to who bears the burden: users or the general public. Even if users bear the burden, that class must be subdivided, e.g. users during peak times or off-peak, freight or passenger traffic, urban or rural users, residents or non-residents (many toll plazas are located on the state line to maximize revenue from non-residents).

A third issue concerns the full costs of transportation. There are monetary costs, which are financed with money, as considered above, but there are also non-monetary costs (sometimes called hidden costs), which are paid for by people&#x27;s time, by clean air, by peace and quiet, etc. See the discussion of externalities for a fuller explication of non-monetary costs.

<text>In mathematical analysis, initialization of the differintegrals is a topic in fractional calculus, a branch of mathematics dealing with derivatives of non-integer order.

== Composition rule of Differintegrals ==

The composition law of the differintegral operator states that although: 

formula_1

wherein &quot;D&quot;−&quot;q&quot; is the left inverse of &quot;Dq&quot;, the converse is not necessarily true:

:formula_2

===Example===

Consider elementary integer-order calculus. Below is an integration and differentiation using the example function formula_3:

:formula_4

Now, on exchanging the order of composition:

:formula_5

Where &quot;C is&quot; the constant of integration. Even if it was not obvious, the initialized condition &quot;ƒ&quot;&#x27;(0) = &quot;C&quot;, &quot;ƒ&quot;&quot;(0) = &quot;D&quot;, etc. could be used. If we neglected those initialization terms, the last equation would show the composition of integration, and differentiation (and vice versa) would not hold.

==Description of initialization==

Working with a properly initialized differ integral is the subject of initialized fractional calculus. If the differ integral is initialized properly, then the hoped-for composition law holds. The problem is that in differentiation, information is lost, as with &quot;C&quot; in the first equation.

However, in fractional calculus, given that the operator has been fractionalized and is thus continuous, an entire complementary function is needed. This is called complementary function formula_6.

<doc id="261323" wikidata="Q49717" url="?curid=261323" title="Crankset">
<text>The crankset (in the US) or chainset (in the UK) is the component of a bicycle drivetrain that converts the reciprocating motion of the rider&#x27;s legs into rotational motion used to drive the chain or belt, which in turn drives the rear wheel. It consists of one or more sprockets, also called &quot;chainrings&quot;
or &quot;chainwheels&quot; attached to the &quot;cranks&quot;, &quot;arms&quot;, or &quot;crankarms&quot; to which the pedals attach. It is connected to the rider by the pedals, to the bicycle frame by the bottom bracket, and to the rear sprocket, cassette or freewheel via the chain.

== Parts ==

=== Cranks ===
The two &quot;cranks&quot;, one on each side and usually mounted 180° apart, connect the bottom bracket axle to the pedals.

==== Lengths ====

Bicycle cranks can vary in length to accommodate different sized riders and different types of cycling. Crank length is measured from the center of the pedal spindle to the center of the bottom bracket spindle or axle. The larger bicycle component manufacturers typically offer crank lengths for adult riders from long in increments, with cranks being the most common size. A few small specialty manufacturers make bicycle cranks in a number of sizes smaller than and longer than . Some manufacturers also make bicycle cranks that can be adjusted to different lengths. While logic would suggest that, all other things being equal, riders with shorter legs should use proportionally shorter cranks and those with longer legs should use proportionally longer cranks, this is not universally accepted. However, very few scientific studies have definitively examined the effect of crank length on sustained cycling performance and the studies&#x27; results have been mixed. Bicycle crank length has not been easy to study scientifically for a number of reasons, chief among them being that cyclists are able to physiologically adapt to different crank lengths. Cyclists are typically more efficient pedalling cranks with which they have had an adaptation period. Several different formulas exist to calculate appropriate crank length for various riders. In addition to the rider&#x27;s size, another factor affecting the selection of crank length is the rider&#x27;s cycling specialty and the type of cycling event. Historically, bicycle riders have typically chosen proportionally shorter cranks for higher cadence cycling such as criterium and track racing, while riders have chosen proportionally longer cranks for lower cadence cycling such as time trial racing and mountain biking. However, the evolution of very low rider torso positions to reduce aerodynamic drag for time trial racing and triathlon cycling can also affect crank selection for such events. Some have suggested that proportionally shorter cranks may have a slight advantage for a rider with a very low torso position and an acute hip angle, especially as the rider pedals near the top-dead-center position of the pedal stroke. Cranks can be shortened for medical reasons using shorteners such as Ortho Pedal.

Unicycle cranks vary in length to accommodate different unicycle wheel sizes, and different unicycling disciplines. As almost all unicycles are ungeared, crank length is a major factor in determining how much force is transmitted to the wheel. Larger wheel diameters, such as , require longer cranks, as do disciplines such as Mountain Unicycling, Trials, Street, and Flatland. These unicycles and disciplines commonly use cranks lengths greater than . For indoor unicycling such as freestyle or hockey, shorter cranks give a smoother pedaling motion and enable tighter turns without the pedal hitting the floor. Crank lengths of are common, although some riders use cranks as short as .

As there is no chainwheel on a unicycle, right and left cranks are identical, except for the pedal attachment thread in the left-hand crank, which is reverse threaded.

==== Materials ====
Cranks are constructed of either an aluminum alloy, titanium, carbon fiber, chromoly steel, or some less expensive steel. Tubular steel cranks (such as Tioga&#x27;s Revolver) can be light and very strong, are usually found on BMX bikes, and are slowly finding their way to mountain bikes (dirt jumping and urban assault). Aluminum cranks may be cast, hot forged or cold forged (&quot;cold&quot; in this context means the billet from which the crank is to be made is heated to a specified temperature well below the melting point, not room temperature). Cold forging gives the metal additional strength, and the cranks can therefore be made lighter without increasing the risk of breakage. Shimano &quot;Hollowtech&quot; aluminum cranks are made by forging the main arms around a hard steel insert which is then withdrawn, leaving an internal void to save weight. They are then welded up before final machining.

==== Attachments ====

===== To the bottom bracket =====

There are a variety of methods used to attach the cranks to the bottom bracket spindle (or axle).
* Older cranks use a wedge-shaped pin, called a cotter, for attachment to the bottom bracket spindle.
* Newer cranks slide onto
** a square tapered spindle. The taper is 2 degrees with respect to the centerline. There are at least two non-interchangeable dimensions (e.g. Shimano and Campagnolo use competing standards in square taper, viz. JIS and ISO respectively, where the ISO spindle is longer and its taper end is slightly smaller. Most parts made by European manufacturers are to the ISO standard, and most Asian manufacturers use the JIS (Shimano) standard), and two orientations: diamond and horizontal square. The hole in the crank in which one screws a crank puller almost always has a diameter of , though some old French cranks (Stonglight and T.A.) require a different puller.
** a hexagonal tapered spindle (Tune components cranks are an example)
** a splined bottom bracket spindle with two prominent specifications, and numerous uncommon ones. The ISIS spline may be the most common splined standard as it was decided on and supported by several companies. Shimano&#x27;s Octalink is a common proprietary standard that comes in two forms: version one for XTR, 105, Ultegra and Dura Ace; and version two for every other groupset such as XT, LX and Deore. Truvativ and DMR also have their own proprietary spline interface standards. A 48 splined spindle, such as from Profile Racing, Demolition, and Eighth Inch, is mostly used for BMX, unicycles, and fixed-gear Freestyle.

:The cranks are pressed into place and prevented from squirming off via fretting by a bolt or nut installed into or onto the bottom bracket spindle. The head of the bolt or the nut sits inside a counterbore that is also threaded to accept a crank puller tool. The counterbore is often covered with a dust cover.
One solution to the issue of fretting is to use a metal based anti-seize lubricant between the mating parts. Composed of assorted mixtures of aluminum, copper, graphite and nickel powders in a grease base, such lubrication allows repeated assembly and disassembly without wear and the elimination of fretting corrosion during use.
* Even newer designs have the bottom bracket spindle, usually hollow and larger diameter than is possible for bottom brackets with bearings held inside the bottom bracket shell of a bike frame, for reduced weight and increased stiffness, permanently attached to the right crank (Shimano and others) or the left crank (Race Face). The left crank slides onto a spline and is tightened with one or more pinch bolts (Shimano) or is pressed onto a spline by a bolt on the bottom bracket spindle (Race Face).
* The latest from Campagnolo, called Ultra-Torque, has each crank permanently attached to one half of the spindle (called semi-axles) which then join in the middle of the bottom bracket with a Hirth joint and a bolt.
* Certain companies such as Cannondale (BB30 open standard, introduced in 2000) have made their own unique bottom bracket standards requiring changes in the bottom bracket shell of the bicycle frame in order to accommodate the bottom bracket/crank design. The open BB30 standard is gaining popularity on high end bicycle and component manufacturers (Zipp, Specialized, FSA).
* Finally, many children&#x27;s bikes and older, or less-expensive bikes have one-piece (&quot;Ashtabula&quot;) cranks where the two cranks and bottom bracket spindle are forged as one piece of steel (see photograph above).

See the bottom bracket article for more details.

===== To the pedals =====

Crank arms have a threaded hole (or &quot;eye&quot;) at their outboard end to accommodate the pedal spindle. Adult or multi-piece cranks have a 9/16 inch hole with 20 TPI (a combination that appears to be unique to this application). One-piece or children&#x27;s cranks use a 1/2 inch hole. Some cranks on children&#x27;s bikes have more than one pedal hole so that the pedal can be moved to accommodate growth.

The right-side (usually the chain side) hole is right-hand threaded, and the left-side hole is left-hand (reverse) threaded to help prevent it from becoming unthreaded by an effect called precession.

Pedal spindles are hard steel, and gradually fret and erode the crankarm where the two meet. This can eventually be a cause of crank breakage, which commonly occurs at the pedal eye. Some manufacturers advise the use of a thin steel washer between the pedal and crank, but this is ineffective because the hard washer frets against the crank instead. A solution, suggested by Jobst Brandt, is to use a 45 degree taper at the surface where crank and pedal meet, as this would eliminate precession-induced fretting and loosening (it is already done for most automobile lug nuts for the latter reason). However, this would require manufacturers to change a well-established standard which currently allows most pedals to be fitted to most cranks.

The solution to the issue of fretting is to use a metal based anti-seize lubricant; being composed of assorted mixtures of aluminium, copper, graphite and nickel powders in a grease base – that allows repeated assembly and disassembly without wear and the elimination of fretting corrosion during use.

=== Spider ===
On older styles, the &quot;spider&quot;—the multi-armed piece that connects the chainring to the bottom bracket axle—was a separate piece from the crank arm. The most common modern cranks have an integrated spider on the drive-side crank arm. However, Middleburn, TA, and Surly currently produce cranks with separate detachable spiders, enabling a wide variety of chainring patterns to be used with the same cranks.

Spiders usually have 4 or 5 arms, although some models have had as few as 3 and many as 10 arms with 6 having been popular in the past.

==== Bolt circle diameter (BCD) ====

Many modern bicycles have removable chainrings, to allow for replacement when worn, or to change the gear ratio provided (although the change is limited).

The holes on the spider arms used for attaching a chainring can have a variety of spacings, referred to as the bolt circle diameter, commonly abbreviated as BCD. This measurement is sometimes referred to as pitch-circle diameter (PCD). Cranks designed to mount one or two chainrings will almost always use a single bolt circle diameter. Cranks designed to mount three chainrings will almost always use two different bolt circle diameters; the larger to mount the two bigger, outer rings and the smaller to mount the smaller, inner ring. Most modern two-chainring cranks use either a bolt circle diameter.

Bolt circle diameters of common cranks:
; vintage single : 151 BCD
; vintage double : 144 BCD
; Single : 130, 135, or 144 BCD
; Road double : 130 BCD (Shimano and others), 135 (Campagnolo), or 122 (others)
; Road triple : 130/74 BCD (Shimano and others), or 135/74 BCD (Campagnolo)
; Cyclocross/compact/touring double : 110 BCD or (Campagnolo carbon 4×110/1×113 BCD)
; Mountain bike (5 arm)/compact/touring triple : 110/74 BCD
; Mountain bike (4 arm): 104/64 BCD
; Mountain bike (5 arm compact) : 94/58 BCD
; Single, double or triple (3 arm) : 70 BCD (René Herse/Compass Bicycles)

=== Chainring ===

Chainrings (also called &quot;chain rings&quot;, &quot;chainwheels&quot; or &quot;sprockets&quot;, although sprocket is used this way mostly in the BMX community) engage the chain to transfer power to the (usually rear) wheel. They usually have teeth spaced to engage every link of the chain as it passes over; however, in the past, some designs (called skip-tooth or inch-pitch) have had one tooth for every other link of the chain.

==== Sizes ====
By convention, the largest chainring is outboard and the smallest is inboard. Chainrings vary in size from as few as 20 teeth to as many as 60 and potentially more.

Chainrings also come in several nominal widths:
* 3/16″ (4.76 mm) for old-time bikes (especially skip-tooth or inch-pitch), heavy duty BMX, Worksman, and exercise bikes
* 1/8″ (3.18 mm) for track, BMX, cruiser bikes, one-speed, three-speeds, and the rare older 3 or 4 speed derailleur bike.
* 3/32″ (2.38 mm) for road, hybrid, mountain bikes, single-speed and 5-, 6-, 7- and 8 speed freewheels or cassettes.
* 5/64″ (1.98 mm) for any bike with 9- or 10-speed cassettes

==== Materials ====
Chainrings are constructed of either an aluminum alloy, titanium, steel, or carbon fiber.

==== Construction ====
Cheaper cranksets may have the chainrings welded or riveted directly to the crank arm or spider. More expensive sets have the chainrings bolted on so that they can be replaced if worn or damaged, or to provide different gearing.

Replacement chainrings must be chosen with a bolt-hole count and spacing that matches the spider.

Chainrings designed for use with multi-chainring crank arms may have ramps or pins to aid in shifting. The middle chainring, in the case of a triple crankset, usually has the most shaping to aid in shifting up and down. The smallest chainring usually has the least, if any shaping.

== Variations ==
=== Tandem cranksets ===
On tandem bicycles the pedalling contribution of both riders is often combined and coordinated by the crank arms. There may be a second set of chainrings, often on the opposite side from the regular drive train, one on each crank set and connected by a separate chain. The most common implementation has both cyclists pedaling at exactly the same pace and usually in phase, although it is possible to configure the system for out-of-phase pedaling.

The most common tandem crankset is a set of four cranks. Both left cranks have spiders and chainrings to be connected by a timing chain, and only one of the right cranks has a spider for the drive chain.

There are tandem cranksets available called independent pedaling system cranksets, which allow each cyclist to pedal, or not, at their own pace.

=== Chain guards ===
Some chainrings can be outfitted with a chain guard — a plastic or metal ring slightly larger in diameter than the chainring. Its purpose is mostly to help prevent the chain from touching or catching clothing. Chain guard is usually mounted on the outboard side of the chainring or, in case of multi-sprocket chainring, on the outboard side of the largest chainring. Single-sprocket chainrings may have chain guards on both inboard and outboard sides, helping keeping the chain on the chainring; this is common on multi-speed juvenile bicycles.

Bicycles that are going to be used in abusive applications, such as freeride and BMX, will often incorporate a very heavy-duty chain guard that is designed to protect the chainrings from physical damage caused by impact with fixed objects; also called &#x27;bashguards&#x27;, these commonly replace a third (large) chainring.

=== Chainguides ===
Some cranksets used for freeride and downhill mountain biking have a chainguide installed. A chainguide is a metal or plastic housing that keeps the chain on the chainrings over rough terrain and during technical riding. Most chainguides are designed for only one front chainring, but there are a few dual-ring chainguides available such as the E13 DRS and MRP LRP. Chainguides include a channel on the top of the chainring to keep the chain in line (for models designed for one front chainring) and a roller or sprocket on the bottom to help keep the chain engaged with the chainring. These are almost always used in conjunction with bashguards. Exceptions including the E.thirteen LG-1 and the MRP G2 (and now the G2 SL) do exist which use integrated skid plates, removing impact forces from the crank&#x27;s spider and transferring them to the frame.

=== Freewheeling cranksets ===
Some cranksets have been produced that incorporate a ratcheting mechanism to accommodate coasting. In this case, the chain continues to rotate with the rear wheel when the rider stops pedaling. The ultimate goal of freewheeling cranks is to allow the rider to shift the chain while coasting. Shimano&#x27;s discontinued FF system (Front Freewheeling) is one of the more commonly seen examples.

=== Left-side-drive ===

This configuration consists of a left crank arm with a spider and chainring, and a right crank arm without a spider, the opposite of a normal configuration. If used with a screw-on freewheel, a special hub with a left hand thread for a special freewheel must be used, which is also threaded left hand and ratchets the opposite direction of a normal freewheel. If the freewheel and hub were threaded with right hand threads, the torque applied by pedaling would loosen and unthread the freewheel from the hub.

Left-side-drive is sometimes done with a fixed gear drivetrain. Because the lock ring prevents the sprocket from unscrewing, it can be used for left-side drive without requiring special left hand threaded parts.

Note that if a normal right-side-drive crankset is installed backwards to create a left-side-drive bicycle, the threaded pedal holes at the end of the crank arms would be reversed. In this configuration, precession may loosen the pedals over time, causing the pedals to become detached and/or damaging the pedal threading in the crank arms. A front crankset designed for tandem use is a commercially available option, since this has a chainring for the timing chain on the left side, though choice of chainring sizes may be limited.

=== Independent crank arms ===
At least one manufacturer offers a crankset in which the crank arms may rotate independently. This is supposed to aid in training by requiring each leg to move its own pedal in a full circle. One independent study has demonstrated training with these cranks can improve cycling efficiency. The manufacturer also claims that this change can also be useful to aid in running improvement, help prevent injuries in runners, improve core strength development, and are useful for the rehabilitation of lower extremity injuries, especially in the athlete. The manufacturer claims these cranks have been used as a training tool by several World and Olympic Champions in both cycling and triathlon and several professional sports teams including MLB and NFL teams, and other uses.

=== Non-round chainrings ===

After a first product commercialized in the late 1970s by Edmond Polchlopek, several manufacturers have tried non-round chainrings, such as Shimano&#x27;s Biopace, Rotor&#x27;s Q-Rings, Ridea&#x27;s PowerRing and Osymetric&#x27;s Harmonic ring. These are designed to provide varying mechanical advantage at different points in the pedal stroke, effectively changing the gear ratio at different angles of rotation with the intention to be more ergonomic. Non-round chainrings can sometimes cause problems in front shifting. Though the benefits of oval chainrings are still disputed in the press and among manufacturers, one study claimed significant benefits, namely that the rider would gain an additional 8 watts of power.

Their popularity in the late eighties to early nineties is best reflected in their widespread use by professional cyclists of that time. However, one hold-out has been Team CSC Saxo Bank veteran Bobby Julich, and there are still a couple of pro riders using them as late as 2011. Notably Bradley Wiggins of Team Sky, David Millar of Team Garmin Transitions and Agritubel&#x27;s Geoffrey Lequatreall riding the Osymetric brand and Team CSC Saxo Bank&#x27;s Carlos Sastre with Rotor&#x27;s Q-Rings from his native Spain. Sastre won the 2008 Tour de France with Q-rings. Bradley Wiggins has used an elliptical chainring from Osymetric since at least 2009,
including in his victory of the 2012 Tour de France.
In the 2010 Giro d&#x27;Italia, and David Millar used them in his 2011 victory in the final TT of the 2011 Giro. Several Pro-Tour teams were using Osymetric and Q-Rings elliptical chainrings for road racing and time trialing. In the 2013 Tour, Chris Froome drew attention with his oval chainring, manufactured by Osymetric.

=== Compact crankset ===
In the context of mountain biking the term compact crankset, or micro drive, refers to smaller triple cranksets, giving a small benefit in weight at the expense of increased wear and also giving the bike better clearance over obstacles. Typical ratios would be 22/32/44 teeth as opposed to 28/38/48 or 24/36/46 teeth. These would be used with smaller cassettes (Generally cassettes are available with 11 tooth minimum gear sizes for compact chainsets while standard chainsets were designed for cassettes with a 13 or 14 tooth top gear), giving the same overall ratio. Compact chainrings have been the dominant standard for mountain bike cranks since the mid nineties.

In the context of road cycling, compact drivetrain typically refers to double cranksets with a smaller (usually ) bolt circle diameter than the standard or Campagnolo&#x27;s . As of 2006, all of the major component manufacturers such as Shimano and Campagnolo offer compact cranks in their midrange and high-end product lines. The compact crankset provides a compromise between the standard road double crankset (with 39/52 or 39/53 tooth chainrings) and the road triple (with 30/42/52 or 30/39/53 tooth chainrings). The compact crankset has two chainrings and typical ratios are 34/48, 34/50 and 36/50. This provides nearly the same lower gear ratios as a triple but without the need for a third chainring, a triple front derailleur and a long cage rear derailleur. Both Shimano and Campagnolo recommend and sell front derailleurs specifically designed for compact cranksets, claiming better shifting.

Compact gearing is not necessarily lower than standard gearing if cassettes with smaller sprockets (such as 11–23) are used. A high gear of 50×11 on a compact drivechain is actually slightly higher than the 53×12 of a standard set.

Compact gearing usually has a large percentage jump between the two chainrings. In balance, it may also allow small jumps in the rear by allowing a closer ratio cassette to be used, except for the 9% jump at the high end between the 11 and 12 tooth sprockets.

=== Bent crankarms ===
Marketed and known by a variety of names (Z-cranks, P.M.P cranks, etc.) non-straight crank arms have been introduced several times. However, &quot;as long as the distance from crank axle to pedal is fixed, there is no pedaling advantage in using bent crank arms&quot;. Possible disadvantages from comparable straight crank arms include more weight and more flex.

=== Rotor Box System ===
 Rotor is a trade name of a type of crank used in the transmission system of a bicycle. The Rotor crank was developed by Aeronautic Engineering School students in Madrid, Spain in 1995 and was later commercialised. While Rotor Box found success with recreational road and mountain cyclists, many competitive cyclists continue to use the traditional fixed system as offered by major manufacturers Campagnolo and Shimano, amongst others. One major factor is weight— the Rotor Box System is 50%–75% heavier than most competitive cranks. Other negative factors include higher purchase cost than other fine cranksets, and increased maintenance due to the complexity of the system. These cranksets are no longer in production, and availability of some parts is problematic. However the bearings are standard parts. A few parts, like links, are still distributed.

This system originated as a cog-driven internal mechanism inside a purpose built bicycle&#x27;s bottom bracket. In this first &quot;ROTOR Box&quot; design, the drive-side crank had an offset chainring spider with round rings. The drive side crank&#x27;s gear ratio varied during the pedalling cycle by moving the round chainring upward and downward in regards to the crank&#x27;s axle. The non-drive side crank was accelerated and decelerated by a gearing mechanism inside the bottom bracket to mimic the gear ratio variation the drive side crank went through, at an exact 180 degree phase-offset. While highly effective mechanically, these bicycles were costly and the significant movement of the chainring made shifting quality problematic.Later generation ROTOR System cranks moved the mechanism into an orbital chainring spider with a fixed rotational axis. These &quot;ROTOR System&quot; cranksets fit into classic BSA and ITA bicycle frames. Unlike a standard pair of cranks that always remain at 180 degrees relative to each other, the ROTOR system varies this angle through the circle of motion. The left and right crank arms speed up and slow down independently, relative to the chainrings during the pedalling cycle. The mechanism causing this is designed by ofsetting the axis of rotation of the crank spindle and spider, then connecting the spider to the individual crank arms via two independent links.

As the crank rotates, the distance between the axle and spider varies. By placing a pivot point on the crank arm and the spider and connecting these via linkages, the varying axle to spider distance pivots the linkages up and down, pushing the cranks forward and pulling them backward relative to the chainrings during the rotation. This increases and decreases the effective gear the cyclists&#x27; two legs push as the crankset rotates. The effect of these movements eliminates the dead spot (where little power is produced) at the top and bottom of the pedaling cycle, and reduces knee strain. The manufacturer claims that power output relative to heart rate is increased, amongst other claimed benefits.

It takes a couple of weeks of regular use to become accustomed to the unusual feel of the Rotor linkage cranksets. After becoming accustomed to it, most riders prefer it. However, there is no difficulty in switching between ordinary cranksets and Rotor linkage cranksets. Once a rider has learned to use Rotor linkage cranksets the adaption when switching back and forth between crankset types only takes a minute or two.

Many competitive cyclists, including the Cervélo TestTeam, use Rotor&#x27;s Q-rings which mimic the fluctuation in gear size without the added weight. However Rotor Q-rings and other non-round rings cannot duplicate the crank arm movements that allow application of power through the dead spots of the pedaling cycle. Non-round rings also increase the difficulty of setting up the front derailleur, while Rotor linkage cranksets present no extra difficulty in that regard.

=== Planetary-drive ===
A planetary-gear crankset offers two different gear ratios with just one chainring. This can have at least two advantages: shifting while not pedaling and fewer chances for the chain to come off the chainring. The Mountain Drive &amp; Speed-Drive by Schlumpf Innovations and the Hammerschmidt are examples.

=== Narrow wide chainring ===
A narrow wide chainring has teeth which are shaped differently for every other tooth. They are the same viewed from the side of the bicycle, but from the front or rear, one tooth is wide and the next is narrow. The pattern continues, narrow wide narrow wide, hence the name. The purpose is to prevent the chain coming off the chainring. It is largely effective at this. Narrow wide chainrings are now standard on premium mountain bikes which have one chainring and a wide cassette up to 50 teeth.

A disadvantage is that they are not compatible with double or triple chainrings.

<text>The Ubangi River (; ; ; ), also spelled Oubangui, is a river in Central Africa, and the largest right-bank tributary of the Congo River. It begins at the confluence of the Mbomou (mean annual discharge 1,350 m3/s) and Uele Rivers (mean annual discharge 1,550 m3/s) and flows west, forming the border between Central African Republic (CAR) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Subsequently, the Ubangi bends to the southwest and passes through Bangui, the capital of the CAR, after which it flows southforming the border between the DRC and the Republic of the Congo. The Ubangi finally joins the Congo River at Liranga.

The Ubangi&#x27;s length is about . Its total length with the Uele, its longest tributary, is . The Ubangi&#x27;s drainage basin is about . Mean annual discharge at mouth 5,936 m3/s. Its discharge at Bangui ranges from about to , with an average flow of about ~. It is believed that the Ubangi&#x27;s upper reaches originally flowed into the Chari River and Lake Chad before being captured by the Congo in the early Pleistocene.

Together with the Congo River, it provides an important transport artery for river boats between Bangui and Brazzaville. From its source to below Bangui, the Ubangi defines the boundary between the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Thereafter, it forms the boundary between the DRC and the Republic of Congo until it empties into the Congo River.

== Lake Chad replenishment project ==

In the 1960s, a plan was proposed to divert waters from the Ubangi to the Chari River. According to the plan, named Transaqua, the water from the Ubangi would revitalize Lake Chad and provide a livelihood in fishing and enhanced agriculture to tens of millions of central Africans and Sahelians. Inter-basin water transfer schemes were proposed in the 1980s and 1990s by Nigerian engineer J.Umolu and the Italian firm Bonifica.

In 1994, the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC) proposed a similar project, and at a March 2008 summit the heads of state of the LCBC member countries committed to the diversion project. In April 2008, the LCBC advertised a request for proposals for a feasibility study.

<doc id="261328" wikidata="Q2248019" url="?curid=261328" title="Emma Peel">
<text>Emma Peel is a fictional character played by Diana Rigg in the British 1960s adventure television series &quot;The Avengers&quot;, and by Uma Thurman in the 1998 film version. She was born Emma Knight, the daughter of an industrialist, Sir John Knight. She is the crime-fighting partner of John Steed.

As a lady spy adventurer and expert in martial arts, she became a feminist role model around the world and is considered an icon of British popular culture. Regarded as a 1960s fashion icon and sex symbol, the character is often remembered for the leather catsuit sometimes worn by Rigg in her early episodes.

==Casting==
Mrs. Peel was introduced as a replacement for the popular character Cathy Gale, played by actress Honor Blackman. Blackman left the programme at the end of the third season to co-star in the James Bond film &quot;Goldfinger&quot;.

Elizabeth Shepherd was initially cast as Emma Peel and production on the fourth season began. After filming all of one episode and part of a second, the producers decided that Shepherd was not suitable for the part, and she was dismissed. No footage of Shepherd as Peel is known to have survived.

The producers had to quickly replace her and gave the job to Diana Rigg; the episodes with Shepherd were then subsequently re-filmed.

==Character==
The character was particularly notable for a number of characteristics. Peel is a strong heroine; she is rarely defeated in fights and is capable of rescuing Steed if he is in trouble. She is a master of martial arts and a formidable fencer. A certified genius, she specialises in chemistry and other sciences. She is often seen in episodes engaging in artistic hobbies and had success in industry at the helm of the company of her late father, Sir John Knight. Her husband, Peter Peel, was a pilot whose plane had disappeared over the Amazonian forest. He was presumed dead for many years, and Peel went on to work with Steed. She drove a convertible Lotus Elan at high speeds, and convincingly portrayed any series of undercover roles, from nurse to nanny. Her favourite guise was that of a women&#x27;s magazine reporter, trying to interview big business tycoons and rich playboys. The name &quot;Emma Peel&quot; is a play on the phrase &quot;Man Appeal&quot; or &quot;M. Appeal&quot;, which the production team stated was one of the required elements of the character. (Diana Rigg was never comfortable in her position as a world-famous sex-symbol.)

Peel&#x27;s verbal interactions with Steed range from witty banter to thinly disguised innuendo. Regarding the constant question of whether they had a sexual relationship at any time, Patrick Macnee thought the characters went to bed on a very regular basis (just not in view of the camera). However, Rigg thought they were most likely engaging in an enjoyable extended flirtation that ultimately went nowhere. Writer/producer Brian Clemens said he wrote them with the idea that they had an affair before Emma&#x27;s first appearance in the series, and they certainly appear to already know each other very well when Emma is first introduced.
Her style of dress typified the period, and the character is still a fashion icon. John Bates was brought in as the costume designer for Emma Peel in the second half of the fourth season. He created a wardrobe of black and white op-art mod clothing and miniskirts. Bates had to stop leaving hems on the mini skirts because the production team kept lowering them again. He also licensed his designs to several manufacturers under the &quot;Avengerswear&quot; label and these pieces were sold in various shops throughout the country. Diana Rigg is often remembered for the leather catsuit she wore early on in her first season. Rigg disliked wearing the leather outfit, so Bates designed softer stretch jersey and PVC catsuits for her instead.

When the show transitioned from black and white to colour, the designer was Alun Hughes, who used bold colours and lurid, psychedelic patterns. Hughes also created the &quot;Emmapeeler&quot; catsuit, which was made of stretch jersey in bright block colours. The Emmapeelers and several other pieces from this season&#x27;s wardrobe were licensed and sold in women&#x27;s fashion shops as well.

==Departure==
When her husband, Peter Peel, surprisingly reappears at the end of &quot;The Forget-Me-Knot&quot;, Emma decides to leave Steed and her spy career behind. In the distant shot in which he appears, Peter Peel looks suspiciously like Steed (and was in fact played by Patrick Macnee&#x27;s stunt double, Peter Weston), and like Steed, he drives a two-door convertible Bentley, albeit a contemporary model. Emma meets her replacement, Tara King (played by Linda Thorson), who enters the building as she herself is leaving and tells her that Steed likes his tea stirred &quot;anti-clockwise&quot;. Peel would be the last of the &quot;talented amateurs&quot; with whom John Steed was teamed, as her successor is a neophyte professional agent.

In real life, Diana Rigg had chosen to leave the series for a number of reasons, one of which was to accept a role in the James Bond film &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (similarly, her predecessor Honor Blackman departed to appear in the Bond film &quot;Goldfinger&quot;).
During her first season, Rigg eventually discovered that she was being paid less than the cameramen: afterwards her salary was tripled and combined with her loyalty to Macnee, she was persuaded to come back for 25 additional episodes (including her farewell episode, which was actually shot well into the Tara King season). Eventually the arduous shooting schedules, various conflicts with the producers, the lure of film and stage roles, and a desire to challenge herself as an actress all combined in her decision to leave the show for good.

After leaving the series, Rigg played a variation of the Emma Peel character in two German short films produced for the 8mm market: &quot;The Diadem&quot; and &quot;The Mini-Killers&quot;. Little behind the scenes information has surfaced, though the films themselves have survived.

==&quot;The New Avengers&quot;==
Emma Peel re-appeared on &quot;The New Avengers&quot; using archive clips from the original series, featured in the episode entitled &quot;K is for Kill&quot;. She briefly speaks with Steed over the phone and mentions that her last name isn&#x27;t Peel anymore; Steed replies, &quot;You&#x27;ll always be Mrs. Peel to me.&quot; Sue Lloyd provided her voice for the new dialogue. It was the only time during the revival that such a crossover with the original series occurred.

==&quot;The Avengers&quot; (1998)==
The character was revived and reworked for the 1998 film version of the show, &quot;The Avengers&quot;. Uma Thurman was cast in the role of Peel opposite Ralph Fiennes as Steed. In the film, Mrs. Peel is a scientist working as part of a weather project. When the project is sabotaged by someone who appears to be her double, she is investigated by Ministry agent John Steed. Ultimately, they team up to find out the truth. The film was a critical and box office failure with the new incarnation of the characters being panned. In 2003, &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine voted Fiennes and Thurman as &quot;The Worst Movie Double Act of All Time&quot; for their performances as Steed and Peel.

<text>José Santos Zelaya López (1 November 1853 – 17 May 1919) was the President of Nicaragua from 25 July 1893 to 21 December 1909. He was liberal.

Zelaya was ousted from office in a rebellion led by conservative Juan José Estrada who was aided by the U.S. government.

== Early life ==

He was a son of José María Zelaya Irigoyen, who was originally from Olancho, Honduras, and his mistress Juana López Ramírez. His father José María was married to Rosario Fernández.

== Politics ==

Zelaya was of Nicaragua&#x27;s Liberal party and enacted a number of progressive programs, including improved public education, railroads, and established steam ship lines. He also enacted constitutional rights that provided for equal rights, property guarantees, habeas corpus, compulsory vote, compulsory education, the protection of arts and industry, minority representation, and the separation of state powers. However, his desire for national sovereignty often led him to policies contrary to foreign investors.

In 1894, he took control of the Mosquito Coast by military force; it had long been the subject of dispute, and was home to a native settlement claimed as a protectorate by the British Empire. Indeed, Nicaragua (and before that Spain) had always claimed the Caribbean Coast, but &quot;Zambos&quot; pirates (former African runaway slaves mixed with local Indians) and part of the Misquito Indians (probably with the Sumos and Ramas as well), together with the military support of the British Marines, tried to create a free, English-speaking settlement under British protection. (Greytown, nowadays Puerto Zelaya). This is similar to the cases of Belize and Guatemala, except that Belize has been an independent nation since 1981. Zelaya&#x27;s aggressive attitude paid off, and the United Kingdom, which probably did not wish to go to war over this distant land, recognized Nicaraguan seizure of the area. The strategic value of this land led to the name &quot;Vía del Tránsito&quot; (&quot;Route of Traffic&quot;). Both the United Kingdom and US wanted the control of this route, which connected the Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Coast across the San Juan River and Lake Nicaragua. At this point, the Panama Canal did not exist, and the US was rising as a new continental power.

Zelaya harbored liberal Honduran dissidents, helping one of them (Policarpo Bonilla) attempt to oust Honduran president Domingo Vásquez.

== Reelection, possibility of a canal, and response from the US ==

José Santos Zelaya was reelected president in 1902 and again in 1906.

The possibility of building a canal across the isthmus of Central America had been the topic of serious discussion since the 1820s, and Nicaragua was long a favored location. When the United States shifted its interests to Panama, Zelaya negotiated with Germany (who happened to be in the middle of a cold war with the U.S over Caribbean ports) and Japan in an unsuccessful effort to have a canal constructed in his state. Fearful that President Zelaya might generate an alternative foreign alignment in the region, and because of his heavy-handed repression of his opposition and his land seizures, he was opposed by the U.S.

José Zelaya had the project of reuniting the Federal Republic of Central America, with, he hoped, himself as national president. With this aim in mind, he gave aid to factions favouring this project in other Central American nations. This threatened to blow up into a full scale Central American war which would endanger the United States Panamanian canal and give European nations, such as Germany, an excuse to intervene to protect the collection of their bank&#x27;s payments in the region or if failing that then demand a land concession.

The Zelaya administration had growing friction with the United States government, for example while the French government had inquired to the U.S. whether a loan to Nicaragua would be deemed unfriendly, the U.S. Secretary of State required the loan to be conditional on U.S. relations. After the loan was pending on the Paris stock exchange, the U.S. further isolated Nicaragua by pointing out any money Zelaya would receive &quot;would be without doubt spent to purchase munitions to oppress his neighbors&quot; and in &quot;hostility to peace and progress in Central America.&quot; The US State Department also demanded that all investments in Central America would also need be approved by the U.S. as a means to protect U.S. interests, peace and liberal institutions. According to a French minister, there was also a desire to overthrow Zelaya.

The U.S. started giving financing aid to his Conservative and Liberal opponents in Nicaragua who broke out in open rebellion in October 1909, led by Liberal General Juan José Estrada. Nicaragua sent its forces into Costa Rica to suppress Estrada&#x27;s pro U.S. rebel forces, but U.S. officials deemed the incursion as an affront to Estrada&#x27;s aims and attempted to persuade Costa Rica into acting first against Nicaragua, but Foreign Minister Ricardo Fernández Guardia assured Calvo that Costa Rica was determined &quot;not to enter such dangerous actions as those proposed by Washington.&quot; It &quot;considered the joint action proposed contrary to the Washington treaty and desired to maintain a neutral attitude.&quot; Costa Rican officials considered the United States a more serious threat to Central American peace and harmony than attacks from Zelaya&#x27;s Nicaragua. Costa Rica Foreign Minister Fernández Guardia insisted, &quot;We do not understand here what interests can the Washington government have that Costa Rica assumes a resolutely aggressive position against Nicaragua, with the danger of compromising the observation of the...conventions of December 20, 1907... It is in Central America&#x27;s interest that U.S. action with respect to Nicaragua should assume the character of an international conflict and in no sense the character of an intervention tolerated and even less solicited or supported by the other signatory republics of the Washington Treaty. So Costa Rica&#x27;s uneasiness meant that it never was a help to USA Policy against Nicaragua&#x27;s aggressive policy towards it in those times. On the contrary, some Liberals from Costa Rica exiled in Nicaragua during Zelaya&#x27;s regime. Liberals returned to the Government in Costa Rica with the polemic President Ascensión Esquivel Ibarra (1902–1906), who was born in Nicaragua and later with the first Government of President Ricardo Jiménez Oreamuno (1910–1914). Liberal returned in Civil and a Democratic way to Costa Rica with the popular and progressive Government of Alfredo González Flores (1914–1917), overthrow by the short Dictatorship (1917–1919) of Federico Tinoco Granados, during World War I.

== US sets up base of operations in Nicaragua ==
Officers of Zelaya&#x27;s government executed some captured rebels; two United States volunteers (Cannon and Groce) were among them, and the U.S. government declared their execution grounds for a diplomatic break between the countries which later led to formal intervention.

At the start of December, United States Marines landed in Nicaragua&#x27;s Bluefields port, to create a neutral zone to protect foreign lives and property but which also acted as a base of operations for the anti-Zelayan rebels. On 17 December 1909, Zelaya turned over power to José Madriz and fled to Spain. Madriz called for continued suppression of the uprising, but in August 1910 diplomat Thomas Dawson obtained the capitulation of the government and the withdrawal of Madriz. Thereafter the U.S. called for a popular voice in the government and a constituent assembly was called to write a constitution for Nicaragua. The vacant presidency was filled by a series of Conservative politicians including Adolfo Diaz. During this time, through free trade and loans, the U.S. influenced the expanding prosperity and development of the country.

==Family==

His son, named after the King of Spain, was pianist Don Alfonso Zelaya. He was educated in Europe before his father sent him to America to pursue a military career. He was a graduate of West Point, 1910, and served four years in the U.S. Army, including the World War I years. In 1911 he married his first wife, American-born Marguerite Lee, grandniece of General Robert E. Lee. They had a son they named José Santos.

As a pianist he played with the San Francisco and Minneapolis symphony orchestras. With a repertoire of 300 classical pieces, his performances were not limited to the concert stage, for he also enjoyed bringing classical music to the vaudeville (Keith-Orpheum Circuit) stage. According to the Spokane (Washington) Spokesman-Review (Mar. 4, 1932):
 &quot;...what is unique about this most affable and rotund Castilian is that he plays classical music and makes vaudeville audiences like it. He has a certain humor, a philosophical way of presenting his music that makes his audiences clamor for more and more.&quot;

Beginning in 1933 he made sporadic film appearances playing bit parts. He is best known today as the Mexican who gives involved and incomprehensible Spanish-language directions to the Three Stooges in their 1942 short, &quot;What&#x27;s the Matador?&quot; His last role was as &quot;Gimpy&quot;, the piano player in &quot;Macao&quot; (1952). He died in North Hollywood on December 14, 1951.

<text>In European folklore of the medieval and early modern periods, familiars (strictly familiar spirits, as &quot;familiar&quot; also meant just &quot;close friend&quot; or companion, and may be seen in the scientific name for dog, &quot;Canis familiaris&quot;) were believed to be supernatural entities, interdimensional beings, or spiritual guardians that would protect or assist witches and cunning folk in their practice of magic, divination, and spiritual insight. According to records of the time, those alleging to have had contact with familiar spirits reported that they could manifest as numerous forms, usually as an animal, but sometimes as a human or humanoid figure, and were described as &quot;clearly defined, three-dimensional... forms, vivid with colour and animated with movement and sound&quot;, as opposed to descriptions of ghosts with their &quot;smoky, undefined form[s]&quot;.

When they served witches, they were often thought to be malevolent, but when working for cunning folk, they were often considered benevolent (although there was some ambiguity in both cases). The former were often categorized as demons, while the latter were more commonly thought of and described as fairies. The main purpose of familiars was to serve the witch, providing protection for them as they came into their new powers.

Since the 20th century some magical practitioners, including adherents of the neopagan religion of Wicca, use the concept of familiars, due to their association with older forms of magic. These contemporary practitioners use pets or wildlife, or believe that invisible versions of familiars act as magical aides.

==Descriptions==
Among those accused witches and cunning-folk who described their familiar spirits, there were commonly certain unifying features. The historian Emma Wilby noted how the accounts of such familiars were striking for their &quot;ordinariness&quot; and &quot;naturalism&quot;, despite the fact that they were dealing with supernatural entities.

Familiar spirits were most commonly small animals, such as cats, rats, dogs, ferrets, birds, frogs, toads, and hares. There were also cases of wasps and butterflies, as well as pigs, sheep, and horses. Familiar spirits were usually kept in pots or baskets lined with sheep&#x27;s wool and fed a variety of things including, milk, bread, meat, and blood.

Familiar spirits usually had names and &quot;were often given down-to-earth, and frequently affectionate, nicknames.&quot; One example of this was Tom Reid, who was the familiar of the cunning-woman and accused witch Bessie Dunlop, while other examples included Grizell and Gridigut, who were the familiars of 17th-century Huntingdonshire witch Jane Wallis.

An agathion is a familiar spirit which appears in the shape of a human or an animal, or even within a talisman, bottle, or magic ring. It is strongest at midday.

==Relationship with sorcerers==
Using her studies into the role of witchcraft and magic in Britain during the Early Modern period as a starting point, the historian Emma Wilby examined the relationship that familiar spirits allegedly had with the witches and cunning-folk in this period.

===Meeting===
In the British accounts from the early modern period at least, there were three main types of encounter narrative related to how a witch or cunning person first met their familiar. The first of these was that the spirit spontaneously appeared in front of the individual while they were going about their daily activities, either in their home or outdoors somewhere. Various examples for this are attested in the sources of the time, for instance, Joan Prentice from Essex, England, gave an account when she was interrogated for witchcraft in 1589 claiming that she was &quot;alone in her chamber, and sitting upon a low stool preparing herself to bedward&quot; when her familiar first appeared to her, while the Cornish cunning-woman Anne Jeffries related in 1645 that hers first appeared to her when she was &quot;knitting in an arbour in our garden&quot;.

The second manner in which the familiar spirit commonly appeared to magical practitioners in Britain was that they would be given to a person by a pre-existing individual, who was sometimes a family member and at other times a more powerful spirit. For instance, the alleged witch Margaret Ley from Liverpool claimed, in 1667, that she had been given her familiar spirit by her mother when she died, while the Leicestershire cunning-woman Joan Willimot related, in 1618, that a mysterious figure whom she only referred to as her &quot;master&quot;, &quot;willed her to open her mouth and he would blow into her a fairy which should do her good. And that she open her mouth, and that presently after blowing, there came out of her mouth a spirit which stood upon the ground in the shape and form of a woman.&quot;

In a number of accounts, the cunning person or witch was experiencing difficulty prior to the appearance of the familiar, who offered to aid them. As historian Emma Wilby noted, &quot;their problems... were primarily rooted in the struggle for physical survival—the lack of food or money, bereavement, sickness, loss of livelihood and so on&quot;, and the familiar offered them a way out of this by giving them magical powers.

===Working===
In some cases, the magical practitioner then made an agreement or entered a pact with their familiar spirit. The length of time that the witch or cunning person worked with their familiar spirit varied between a few weeks through to a number of decades. In most cases, the magical practitioner would conjure their familiar spirit when they needed their assistance, although there are many different ways that they did this: the Essex witch Joan Cunny claimed, in 1589, that she had to kneel down within a circle and pray to Satan for her familiar to appear while the Wiltshire cunning woman Anne Bodenham described, in 1653, that she conjured her familiars by methods learned from books. In some rarer cases there were accounts where the familiars would appear at times when they were unwanted and not called upon, for instance the Huntingdonshire witch Elizabeth Chandler noted, in 1646, that she could not control when her two familiars, named Beelzebub and Trullibub, appeared to her, and had prayed for a god to &quot;deliver her therefrom&quot;. It was also believed that familiars &quot;helped diagnose illnesses and the sources of bewitchment and were used for divining and finding lost objects and treasures. Magicians conjured them in rituals, then locked them in bottles, rings and stones. They sometimes sold them as charms, claiming the spirits would ensure success in gambling, love, business or whatever the customer wanted. This sort of familiar was technically not illegal; England&#x27;s Witchcraft Act 1603 prohibited only evil and wicked spirits&quot;.

===Types===
Familiars are most common in western European mythology, with some scholars arguing that familiars are only present in the traditions of Great Britain and France. In these areas, three categories of familiars are believed to exist:

* familiar spirits manifesting as humans and humanoids, throughout Western Europe
* divinatory spirits manifesting as animals, Great Britain and France
* malevolent spirits manifesting as animals, only in Greece

===Prince Rupert&#x27;s dog===
During the English Civil War, the Royalist general Prince Rupert was in the habit of taking his large poodle dog named Boy into battle with him. Throughout the war the dog was greatly feared among the Parliamentarian forces and credited with supernatural powers. As noted by Morgan, the dog was apparently considered a kind of familiar. At the end of the war the dog was shot, allegedly with a silver bullet.

==Witch trials==
Most data regarding familiars comes from the transcripts of English and Scottish witch trials held during the 16th and 17th centuries. The court system that labeled and tried witches was known as the Essex. The Essex trial of Agnes Sampson of Nether Keith, East Lothian, Scotland, in 1590, presents prosecution testimony regarding a divinatory familiar. This case is fundamentally political, trying Sampson for high treason, and accusing Sampson for employing witchcraft against King James VI. The prosecution asserts Sampson called familiar spirits and resolved her doubtful matter. Another Essex trial is that of Hellen Clark, tried in 1645, in which Clark was compelled to state that the Devil appeared as a &quot;familiar&quot; in the form of a dog.

The English court cases reflect a strong relationship between State&#x27;s accusations of witchcraft against those who practiced ancient indigenous traditions, including the familiar animal or spirit.

In some cases familiars replace children in the favour of their mothers. (See witchcraft and children.)

In colonial America animal familiars can be seen in the witch hunts that took place in Salem, Massachusetts, in 1692. Familiar spirits often appear in the visions of the afflicted girls. Although the 1648 law that defined a witch as one who &quot;hath or consulteth with a familiar spirit&quot; had been suspended ten years earlier, association with a familiar spirit was used in the Salem trials as evidence to convict suspected witches. Sarah Good was said to have a yellow bird who sucked between her fingers. Ann Putnam in particular was supposed to have frequently seen the yellow bird in her afflictions. Tituba was said to have seen strange animals that urged her to hurt children, which included a hog, a black dog, a red cat and a black cat. &quot;During the Salem witch trials, there is little account of the practice of animal familiars, although one man was charged with encouraging a dog to attack by way of magical means. The dog, interestingly enough, was tried, convicted, and hanged&quot;.

The witch&#x27;s mark added a sexual component to the familiar spirit and is often found in trial records as a way to convict a suspected witch. The mark was most commonly an extra teat found somewhere on the body and was suspected to be used to suckle the familiar spirits. An example of this can be seen in the Salem witch trials of 1692. For example, Ann Putnam told Martha Corey that, &quot;There is a yellow burd a sucking between your fore finger and midel finger I see it.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Historiography===
Recent scholarship on familiars exhibits the depth and respectability absent from earlier demonological approaches. The study of familiars has grown from an academic topic in folkloric journals to a general topic in popular books and journals incorporating anthropology, history and other disciplines. James Sharpe, in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft: the Western Tradition&quot;, states: &quot;Folklorists began their investigations in the 19th Century [and] found that familiars figured prominently in ideas about witchcraft.&quot;

In the first decades of the 20th century, familiars are identified as &quot;niggets&quot;, which are &quot;creepy-crawly things that witches kept all over them&quot;.

<text>Bune is a demon listed in demonological grimoires such the &quot;Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; (including Thomas Rudd&#x27;s version, as Bime) Johann Weyer&#x27;s &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot;, Jacques Collin de Plancy&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire Infernal&quot;, and the Livre des Esperitz.

All of these texts describe Bune as a duke who is able to move the dead, make one rich, and answer a variety of questions. The Livre des Esperitz claims that Bune rules 35 legions of spirits, while the other texts only give him 30 legions to command. The other texts further describe Bune&#x27;s appearance as a three headed dragon (with one head being human) and give him the additional powers of making devils gather around graves and making one wise and charismatic.

Practicing occultist Carroll &quot;Poke&quot; Runyon suggests that the name ultimately derives from Buto (a title for Isis), as part of an overall claim that the Lesser Key of Solomon was by Solomon and rooted in Mesopotamian mythology.

According to Rudd, Bune is opposed by the Shemhamphorasch angel Haaiah.

<text>A dragstrip is a facility for conducting automobile and motorcycle acceleration events such as drag racing. Although a quarter mile (1320 feet, 402 m) is the best known measure for a drag track, many tracks are eighth mile (201 m) tracks, and the premiere classes will run 1,000 foot (304.8 m) races. The race is begun from a standing start which allows three factors to affect the outcome of the race: reaction time, power/weight ratio, and traction.

==Features==
A dragstrip is a straight, purpose-built racetrack, typically an eighth, ten feet longer than three-sixteenths, or a quarter of a mile long (660/1,000/1320 feet, 201/304.8/402 m), with an additional &quot;shutdown area&quot; to allow vehicles room to stop after crossing the finish line. Common features also include a &#x27;water box&#x27; where vehicles and motorcycles start their burnouts for tire clean-up and also to heat up their tires to improve traction. There is a set of lights known as a &#x27;Christmas Tree&#x27; that counts down to the start. There are also return lanes for the vehicles to return from the end of the track to the pit area.

== Vehicle equipment requirements ==
Like all other motorsports, drag racing has many safety requirements for the vehicles that compete. These can be found in the applicable governing body&#x27;s rule book. Most rules do not apply until the vehicle exceeds a specified time, such as 10.99 seconds. This allows anyone with a regular production vehicle to take part for very little cost, and encourages participation of many people who cannot afford a proper racing vehicle. The grassroots efforts are primarily bracket racing cars. Many classes allow drivers to drive their street cars and participate in an event.

== Dragstrip locations==
==Quarter mile times==
Acceleration times differ even between identical vehicles due to widely varying factors - vehicle tune, elevation, driver/rider differences, payload, track surface conditions, weather conditions.

&quot;NOTE: Nitro Funny Car records set at , which since 2008 in the US by NHRA, 2012 internationally by FIA, and 2017 in Australia by IHRA is the official distance for both Top Fuel and Funny Car in the respective sanctioning bodies.&quot;

&quot;All official records must be backed up within one percent during the same race meet in order to be claimed. The official records for terminal velocity and elapsed time are different in the professional car categories, and only the elapsed time run (and respective speed of that run) is listed. There have been some cases where a car has run faster than the official record, but because they were not backed up within one percent during the same meet, they are not recognised by the NHRA, IHRA, or FIA. The Top Fuel record listed as the final quarter-mile record in IHRA prior to off-season rule change at the end of 2016–17 season that shortened Top Fuel to 1,000 feet.&quot;

<text>Gamigin is a demon described in demonological grimoires such as &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; (the fourth Goetic demon; referred to in the Crowley/Mathers edition as Samigina) and Johann Weyer&#x27;s &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot; (the forty-sixth; referred to as Gamygyn). 

Both works describe him as a marquis who initially takes the form of a small horse before transforming into a hoarse-voiced human. &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; merely leaves his duties at teaching liberal arts and giving accounts of souls that died in sin. 

According to Rudd, Gamigin is opposed by the Shemhamphorasch angel Ieuiah. The &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot;, Thomas Rudd&#x27;s variant of the &quot;Ars Goetia&quot;, and the &quot;Dictionnaire Infernal&quot; go into more detail than the &quot;Lesser Key&quot;, with Gamigin forcing the souls of those who drowned into &quot;airy bodies&quot; to answer questions in either, with Weyer and de Plancy further claiming that Gamigan can do likewise for souls &quot;which dwell in purgatorie (which is called Cartagra, that is, affliction of soules)&quot;.

<text>Gravediggaz were an American hip hop group from New York. Known for their dark sense of humor and abrasive, menacing soundscapes, Gravediggaz blended hardcore hip hop and gangsta rap with horror elements to pioneer the hip-hop subgenre of horrorcore.

The group was formed in 1991, bringing together Prince Paul (The Undertaker), Frukwan (The Gatekeeper), Too Poetic (The Grym Reaper) and Prince Rakeem (The RZArector). It came about largely due to the efforts of Prince Paul. Frukwan and Prince Paul were previously together in the group Stetsasonic.

==Biography==

The group&#x27;s first album was originally titled &quot;Niggamortis&quot;; however, this potentially risqué title was changed to &quot;6 Feet Deep&quot; for the American market (European versions of the album retained the original title, and also included the bonus track &quot;Pass the Shovel&quot;); it was released on August 9, 1994. The four members adopted &quot;Gravedigga&quot; alter egos for their work with the group: Prince Rakeem became The RZArector; Poetic became The Grym Reaper; Prince Paul became The Undertaker; and Frukwan became The Gatekeeper. In 1995, the three rhyming members (without Prince Paul) released a collaborative EP titled &quot;The Hell E.P.&quot; with English trip hop artist Tricky.

The second full-length Gravediggaz album &quot;The Pick, the Sickle and the Shovel&quot; was less humorous, dealing more with social and political issues; it also used calmer and more conventional production. Prince Paul played a considerably smaller role in the making of this album, with many of the production duties eventually taken care of by RZA and his Wu-Tang affiliates (including True Master and 4th Disciple).

A bootleg Gravediggaz album, named &quot;Scenes from the Graveyard&quot;, surfaced in 1998. It featured seven unreleased tracks plus some remixes from the first two albums.

Gravediggaz recruited DJ Diamond J. Poetic died of colon cancer in July 2001. Frukwan stated in an interview not long after Poetic&#x27;s death that a new album using leftover Poetic material would be released. &quot;Nightmare in A-Minor&quot;, the third official album, came out in 2001; it featured two of the original members, Poetic and Frukwan. The album is considered to be the group’s darkest work yet, including many references to Poetic&#x27;s struggle with cancer, as well as apocalyptic themes to do with the teachings of the Five-Percent Nation. Although RZA did not take part in the album, some Wu-Tang Clan affiliates such as 4th Disciple, True Master, Prodigal Sunn, Beretta 9, and Shogun Assason were involved. The album was mostly produced by Poetic and Frukwan. A different version of the album (minus the song &quot;Better Wake Up&quot;) was released in 2002, for which some of the tracks created by Poetic were replaced or altered.

In 2003, Frukwan released his debut solo album, &quot;Life&quot;. The compilation album, &quot;6 Feet Under&quot;, was released in 2004 by X-Ray/Cleopatra Records and featured songs from &quot;Nightmare in A-Minor&quot; and &quot;Life&quot;. According to Frukwan, he had nothing to do with the release and claimed that song titles were changed without permission, making it an unauthorized release.

In 2010, Gravediggaz recorded a new song, &quot;2 More Cups of Blood&quot;. In 2011, it was announced that the group had been recording new tracks involving Shabazz the Disciple &amp; Killah Priest.

In 2018, the Gatekeeper released &quot;1 Cup of Blood&quot; under the Gravediggaz name.

==Style and influence==
According to Frukwan, the group&#x27;s name means &quot;digging graves of the mentally dead, and it stood for resurrecting the mentally dead from their state of unawareness and ignorance.&quot; The group&#x27;s lyrics mix black humor, including topics such as suicide, death, killing, psychopathy, hell, etc.; criticism regarding the music industry; cartoonish violence reminiscent of the Geto Boys, Insane Poetry, or early Three 6 Mafia; and esoteric references to the Nation of Gods and Earths. The group pioneered the horrorcore genre.

The irony used by Gravediggaz has influenced hardcore techno through Mark Newland&#x27;s sampling of the group&#x27;s prose in Nasenbluten.

<text>Fox William Mulder () is a fictional FBI Special Agent and one of the two protagonists of the Fox science fiction-supernatural television series &quot;The X-Files&quot;, played by David Duchovny. Mulder&#x27;s peers dismiss his many theories on extraterrestrial or paranormal activity as those of a conspiracy theorist and supernaturalist; however, his skeptical but supportive partner, Special Agent Dana Scully, often finds them to be unexpectedly correct. He and Scully work in the X-Files office, concerned with unsolved FBI cases that are often revealed to be supernatural or extraterrestrial in nature. Mulder was a main character for the first seven seasons, but was then not limited to a recurring character for the following two seasons. He returns as a main character for the tenth and eleventh seasons.

Mulder made his first appearance in the first season pilot episode, broadcast in 1993. Mulder believes in extraterrestrial unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and a government conspiracy to hide or deny the truth of their existence. Mulder considers the X-Files and the truth behind the supposed conspiracy so important that he has made them the main focus of his life.

==Fictional character biography==

Mulder was born on October 13, 1961, on the island of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Massachusetts. The mysterious disappearance of Mulder&#x27;s sister and his ensuing search for her became the consuming drive of his life. In 1983, Mulder graduated with first-class honors from the University of Oxford with a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology. He then graduated with honors from the Quantico FBI Training Academy in 1986. Mulder joined the FBI on October 24, 1984. On graduating from the academy, Mulder began his work in the Behavioral Science Unit (psychological profiling) under Special Agent Bill Patterson, with whom he had a testy relationship.

In 1988, the FBI assigned Mulder to the Violent Crimes Unit. Around this time, Mulder first came across the X-Files, an obscure FBI section dealing with cases relating to the paranormal; he pored over these cases in his spare time, becoming obsessed with them. In 1991, Mulder re-opened the X-Files with Special Agent Diana Fowley, but Fowley left shortly thereafter. Mulder investigated the X-Files by himself until March 1992, when Special Agent Dana Scully, an instructor at the FBI Academy&#x27;s Forensic Science Research and Training Center, was partnered with him for the purpose of applying scientific reasoning to Mulder&#x27;s work and theories.

Mulder&#x27;s ultimate goal was to uncover what he believed to be a government conspiracy to hide the truth about alien life, and to find out what had happened to his sister. His quest and belief in the existence of aliens were, for most of the series, the driving force of the plot, or mytharc. However, during a period of time after Scully&#x27;s cancer went into remission (season 5), Mulder was convinced by Michael Kritschgau that aliens did not in fact exist and that the government conspirators had merely concocted that threat as a smokescreen, to justify military activities and toy with him.

During the seventh season, Mulder eventually discovers the truth about his sister. Samantha was abducted (either by the alien colonists or the government conspirators), and various tests were performed on her. She was then returned to The Smoking Man to live out her life under his supervision, all the while undergoing additional tests. She was unable to bear the testing any longer so she ran away from her home and was eventually admitted to a nearby hospital, where she disappeared from her locked room. It is revealed that Samantha was taken by &quot;spiritual intervention&quot;, with the help of beings called &quot;Walk-ins&quot;. Mulder is briefly reunited with Samantha&#x27;s spirit.

Mulder was also abducted by the aliens himself in 2000, and returned to Earth, almost dead, a few months later. He had been infected by an alien virus (for the second time), but Scully found a way to rescue him. After Mulder returned home to his apartment, an application was submitted to the FBI for his reinstatement to the X-Files but this was declined by Deputy Director Alvin Kersh, who had been promoted in charge of the X-Files shortly after Mulder had been abducted. He returned to work for a brief period of time, but was eventually fired for failure to follow orders not to investigate any X-Files. After Scully gave birth to William, Mulder went into hiding in New Mexico after Kersh said his life was in danger.

After about a year in hiding, Mulder obtains crucial information from a secret facility about the date of the planned alien colonization effort, but is caught and put on trial for the murder of Knowle Rohrer. Despite a defense organized by Walter Skinner with numerous witnesses, the judges sentence Mulder to death. With help from several people, including a reformed Kersh and the ghost of Alex Krycek, Mulder breaks out of prison and escapes with Scully. As of the series finale, Mulder and Scully were on the run. Six years after the events of the ninth season, Fox Mulder&#x27;s fugitive status is clear. Scully mentions that he is wanted by the FBI and the dialogue also shows that the FBI does not really want to find him and is simply happy to have him &quot;out of their hair&quot;. He is called to assist with the investigation of a missing FBI agent. In exchange for his help, all charges against him are dropped.

Seven years later, Mulder returns to the FBI when the X-Files is re-opened, in order to look into a government conspiracy, when it transpires they have been using alien technology. Along with Scully, they investigate several cases together like they had done originally. Six weeks after their return to the X-Files, Mulder confronts an alive Smoking Man to try to prevent him from carrying out a plan to depopulate the United States using a virus applied to smallpox vaccines. In a vision of Scully&#x27;s, Mulder falls sick to the disease, but refuses the Smoking Man&#x27;s help and his proposal to join his elite. Mulder is saved by Agent Miller and they regroup with Scully; however, she says Mulder needs a blood transfusion and only their son can give it to them. At that moment, an unidentified flying object hovers over the trio, which is where season ten ends. The beginning of season eleven reveals this vision came from Scully&#x27;s son, William. Over the course of season eleven, Scully and Mulder search for William. Skinner learns from the Smoking Man that the Smoking Man, who is Mulder&#x27;s father, also artificially impregnated Scully, and thus is William&#x27;s father as well. In the third episode of the eleventh season, &quot;Plus One&quot;, Scully and Mulder are intimate again. In the season 11 finale, &quot;My Struggle IV&quot;, she reveals to Mulder that she is pregnant with his child.

=== Characterization ===
Despite his aloofness and cynical sense of humor, Mulder displays unbridled enthusiasm and interest when it comes to the paranormal, especially because of his personal involvement after his sister&#x27;s abduction. Walter Skinner and other FBI officials have become concerned by his unprofessional behavior. This only proves true as Mulder makes a habit of letting his personal feelings cloud his judgment; his emotional attachment to UFO cases becomes more severe throughout the series, because of Dana Scully&#x27;s eventual abduction and resultant cancer as well as his sister&#x27;s abduction. Mulder can lose his temper when Scully is involved; on multiple occasions, he has become violent in his grief and unreserved in threatening physical force. Mulder&#x27;s overprotectiveness of Scully stems not only from his obvious devotion and love for her, but also a long-harbored guilt; Mulder has admitted feeling indirectly responsible for the ordeals and tragedies Scully had gone through because of their investigations.

In the episode &quot;Drive&quot;, Mulder facetiously apologizes on behalf of the &quot;international Jewish conspiracy&quot; in response to the abusive and anti-Semitic tirades of a suspect, to which Mulder appears to take offense; the suspect also guesses Mulder&#x27;s ethnicity is Jewish based on his last name. Despite this, in the episode &quot;Kaddish&quot;, Mulder is unable to identify a Talmudic book, states that he does not know Hebrew, and quips that Jesus returned from the dead. Also, Mulder, as his father before him, had a Christian burial presided over by a Protestant minister following his apparent &quot;death&quot; in the episode &quot;Deadalive&quot;. This suggests he hails from a Protestant background, as Scully hails from a Catholic background. Mulder also seeks comfort in a Christian church following the events of the episode &quot;Conduit&quot;. Of course Mulder could conceivably be of a Jewish ethnic descent but a Christian background, perhaps through ancestral marriage or conversion. David Duchovny suggested Mulder is Jewish when interviewed during production of the second season. In the episode &quot;The Field Where I Died&quot;, Mulder went into a hypnotic trance and recalls a past life, where he is in a concentration camp during the Holocaust, and another where he was a Confederate soldier killed in the Battle of Chattanooga.

Mulder is almost never seen sleeping in a bed. The bedroom in his apartment (which appeared as late as the sixth season of the show&#x27;s run) is apparently used for storage and is filled floor to ceiling with junk, including a couple of boxes of pornographic magazines. Instead, Mulder sleeps on his couch, often falling asleep to a blaring television. Mulder can seem to go through manic periods when worried or working on a case, contributing to or exacerbating his insomniac tendencies. Since &quot;Dreamland II&quot; where a &quot;man in black&quot; body-swaps with Mulder and takes over his life, Mulder gets his bedroom renovated and equipped with a waterbed. In &quot;Monday&quot; he finds himself soaked through when his waterbed (which he can&#x27;t remember getting because Morris Fletcher got it in Dreamland) is leaking.

=== Relationships ===

Mulder had a rather strained relationship with his parents Bill and Teena Mulder, not least thanks to the X-Files. Initially, he had no idea his father was involved in the conspiracy and Samantha&#x27;s disappearance. Bill, who became disenchanted with the shadow government and his own role in the conspiracy, eventually approached Fox about his past deeds but was shot and killed by Alex Krycek – working as an assassin for the Syndicate – before he could reveal any great amount of information. Over the next few years, Mulder got into several conflicts with his mother while trying to discover the extent of her own knowledge of his father&#x27;s precise involvement. Teena dies of an apparent suicide when the stress of Samantha&#x27;s abduction finally becomes too painful.

During the last years of his work on the X-Files, Mulder was even forced to doubt that Bill was his true father. He is led to consider the possibility that his mother had had an affair with the Smoking Man, a connection which may have resulted in the birth of either Samantha or Mulder himself. The possibility was hinted at later in the series, and Jeffrey Spender, who certainly was the Smoking Man&#x27;s son, said that Mulder was his half-brother. In the ninth season, &quot;William&quot; explains that Spender and Mulder have very similar DNA, providing strong evidence that they do have the same father.

During his studies at Oxford, around the year of 1983, he was dating Phoebe Green; future investigator of Metropolitan Police Service (season 1, episode 12, &quot;Fire&quot;). When he started his work on &quot;The X-Files&quot;, around 1991, he was close with his current partner; Diana Fowley (season 5, episode 20, &quot;The End&quot;). None of those remained longterm and stable.

Mulder&#x27;s closest friend was FBI partner Dana Scully, who was assigned to &quot;debunk [his] work&quot; by the conspirators and the FBI brass. But against their intentions, her loyalties quickly became affixed to Mulder&#x27;s quest and Mulder himself, a connection which seemed to pull Mulder&#x27;s work out of obscurity, as Scully&#x27;s scientific bent afforded them a certain amount of credibility. Their intense professional and personal relationship continued to strengthen through the years. While the relationship was platonic for the greater part of the series, there are clues that it developed into a romantic one by the last few seasons. Mulder and Scully almost always called each other by their surnames – Mulder purportedly hated his first name, but Scully had no such aversion. At the fourth episode of season seven the romantic undertones were confirmed when the two shared a kiss. In the series finale, the final scene depicted Mulder and Scully after running away together, in bed together, contemplating what the future held. In the season 11 finale Scully revealed to be pregnant with his unborn child.

Mulder&#x27;s greatest nemesis was The Smoking Man, who, despite his obvious ill-intent, seemed to hold Mulder in special regard. Though he mocked Mulder to his face for his foolishness and the futility of his quest, in &quot;Two Fathers&quot;, he told his son Jeffrey Spender, &quot;You pale to Fox Mulder.&quot; Mulder also developed an intense enmity for Alex Krycek, a double agent who briefly worked with Mulder in the FBI as an infiltrator, and who continued to serve as a recurring adversary, acting as an assassin for the Syndicate in the murders of Bill Mulder and Melissa Scully.

===Appearances===

Duchovny portrays Mulder as a series regular for the first seven seasons of the show. Duchovny left the show following the seventh-season finale &quot;Requiem&quot;, wherein he was abducted by aliens. Although he makes a handful of cameos in the first part of season eight—most notably in the episodes &quot;Within&quot;, &quot;Without&quot;, &quot;The Gift&quot;, and &quot;Per Manum&quot;—Mulder is returned by the aliens and the latter part of the season deals with his death, subsequent resurrection, and his departure from the FBI. After the conclusion of the eighth season, Duchovny left the show and only appeared in four ninth-season episodes: &quot;Trust No 1&quot;, &quot;Jump the Shark&quot;, &quot;William&quot;, and &quot;The Truth&quot;. Duchovny&#x27;s appearances in &quot;Trust No 1&quot; and &quot;Jump the Shark&quot; were via archival footage, and he only made a small cameo in the third. However, his appearance in &quot;The Truth&quot;, the program&#x27;s series finale, was substantial, and Duchovny was once again listed in the credits as starring.

== Conceptual history ==

David Duchovny had worked in Los Angeles three years prior to &quot;The X-Files&quot;. At first, he wanted to base his acting career around films, but in 1993 his manager Melanie Green gave him a script of the pilot episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Green and Duchovny were both convinced it was a good script, so Duchovny auditioned for the lead. When Duchovny was auditioning for the part of Fox Mulder, he made a terrific audition but talked rather slowly. Chris Carter thought that he was a good judge of character, and thought that Duchovny wasn&#x27;t too bright. So he talked to Duchovny and asked him if he could please imagine himself as an FBI agent for the future weeks. The casting director of the show was very positive about him, while according to Carter, Duchovny turned out to be one of the best-read people he knew. After getting the role, Duchovny thought the show wouldn&#x27;t last for long or that it wouldn&#x27;t make as much impact as it did.

Carter has said that he named Mulder after his mother&#x27;s maiden name. His first name, Fox, was actually not a tribute to the Fox network which aired &quot;The X-Files&quot;, as often assumed – Carter said he had a childhood friend named Fox. Mulder was inspired by the fictional character Carl Kolchak, a newspaper reporter Carter described as a &quot;believer&quot; just like Mulder. Kolchak was in turn inspired by the fictional character Harry Picard, a policeman in Les Whitten&#x27;s vampire novel &quot;The Progeny of the Adder&quot;. Duchovny got the script with many of Mulder&#x27;s characteristics fully formed. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz called portraying actor Duchovny amazingly smart. He further stated that Duchovny was behind some of the main characteristic ideas behind Mulder.

At the end of the seventh season Duchovny was in negotiations with the Fox network, saying he wanted more money (while not saying how much) and an improved work schedule, among other issues. After settling his contract dispute, Duchovny quit full-time participation in the show after the seventh season. This contributed to uncertainties over the likelihood of an eighth season. Carter and most fans felt the show was at its natural endpoint with Duchovny&#x27;s departure, but it was decided Mulder would be abducted at the end of the seventh season, leaving things open for the actor&#x27;s return in 12 episodes the following year. Duchovny&#x27;s character Mulder was replaced by John Jay Doggett (portrayed by Robert Patrick). In season nine, Duchovny wasn&#x27;t available for shooting, so he only appeared in three episodes with small cameos, the first being an archive footage only in &quot;Trust No 1&quot;, a brief cameo in &quot;William&quot;, which he also directed and appeared full-time in the series finale, &quot;The Truth&quot;.

After the show ended, Carter and Frank Spotnitz started to talk about a movie sequel. Duchovny stated in an interview that very same year that it always had been a desire to come back to the franchise, saying it was a natural stage of development for the franchise to go to the cinema. When talking about Mulder in &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot;, Duchovny said that he wanted to play him a &quot;little different&quot;. He continued saying that Mulder had &quot;lost every battle&quot; and was &quot;beaten down by life ... . He&#x27;s the same guy, but he is older Mulder&quot;.

Mulder had a brief cameo on &quot;The Lone Gunmen&quot;, an &quot;X-Files&quot; spin-off featuring the characters of the same name. He appeared on the episode &quot;All About Yves&quot;. In the &quot;Millennium&quot; episode &quot;Lamentation&quot;, the main character, Frank Black, visits the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, and Mulder and Dana Scully are briefly seen descending a stairway. In fact, they are Duchovny and Anderson&#x27;s stand-ins.

== Reception ==
Duchovny was nominated for two Emmy Awards in 1997 and 1998 in the category &quot;Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series&quot;, but lost. He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in 1995 in the category &quot;Best Actor – Drama Series&quot;. Two years later he was again nominated for a Golden Globe in the same category and won, in 1997 and 1998 he was nominated in the same category but didn&#x27;t win. Duchovny has been nominated five times in the category &quot;Outstanding Actor – Drama Series&quot; by the Screen Actors Guild awards but didn&#x27;t win once. Duchovny won a Satellite Award in the category &quot;Best Actor – Drama Series&quot; in 1997, and was nominated once again 1998.

Animated versions of Mulder appeared on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;Eek! the Cat&quot; (both series which have been featured in episodes of The X-Files), in the episodes &quot;The Springfield Files&quot; and &quot;Eek Space-9&quot;, respectively. Both featured the voice acting of Duchovny. Duchovny appeared as Mulder on the sketch show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; with Molly Shannon as Scully, when he hosted an episode. Joining him was co-star Nicholas Lea, who would appear as Alex Krycek in a sketch that spoofed &quot;The X-Files&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; writer Joyce Millman said that &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; character Special Agent Dale Cooper could have been Mulder&#x27;s &quot;quirky ... spiritual twin&quot; if David Duchovny hadn&#x27;t appeared in the show earlier. When reviewing &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot;, reviewer Moira Macdonald said it was a &quot;kick&quot; watching Duchovny and Gillian Anderson (who portrayed Dana Scully). Jesse Hassenger from &quot;PopMatters&quot; when reviewing season eight, was throughout negative to the new season, claiming that Patrick was miscast and calling David Duchovny&#x27;s appearances as Mulder shallow. Critics and fans alike have praised Duchovny and Anderson&#x27;s &quot;on-screen chemistry&quot; for years. Richard Corliss from &quot;Time&quot; magazine praised Duchovny for settling in his role so &quot;quickly&quot; and calling the character &quot;an obsessive plodder&quot;. Robert Patrick, the actor who replaced Duchovny as the male lead after the seventh season, commented that the chemistry Duchovny and Gillian Anderson had, could only happen &quot;once in a lifetime&quot;.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked Fox Mulder #7 in its &quot;50 Greatest Sci-Fi Legends&quot; list.

<doc id="261345" wikidata="Q1782342" url="?curid=261345" title="Paimon">
<text>Paimon is a spirit named in early grimoires. These include &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; (in the &quot;Ars Goetia&quot;), Johann Weyer&#x27;s &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot;, Jacques Collin de Plancy&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire Infernal&quot;, the &quot;Livre des Esperitz&quot; (as &quot;Poymon&quot;), the &quot;Liber Officiorum Spirituum&quot; (as Paimon), &quot;The Book of Abramelin&quot;, and certain French editions of &quot;The Grimoire of Pope Honorius&quot; (as Bayemon); as well as British Library, Sloane MS 3824.

==Status and rank==
The &quot;Goetia&quot; and Weyer begin entries on King Paimon noting that he is quite obedient to Lucifer.

King Paimo(n) appears as the ninth spirit in the &quot;Ars Goetia&quot;, the 22nd spirit in the &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot;, and in the &quot;Dictionnaire Infernal&quot;. In the &quot;Liber Officiorum Spirituum&quot;, he is first listed as the sixth spirit and later as the third king.

The &quot;Goetia&quot;, Weyer, de Plancy, &quot;Livre des Esperitz&quot;, &quot;Liber Officiorum Spirituum&quot;, and Sloane MS 3824 all rank Paimon as a king. The &quot;Livre des Espiritz&quot;, Sloane MS 3824, and the &quot;Grimoire of Pope Honorius&quot; specify that King Paimon is king of the west. In the &quot;Book of Abramelin&quot; (where his appearance is given no description), he is instead one of the eight dukes. It is said that he has no power over the lord above and would be demolished in any battle.

==Relationship to hierarchy==
The &quot;Goetia&quot;, Weyer, and de Plancy warn that if King Paimon appears alone, a sacrifice must be made to summon Lebal (sometimes called Bebal), the most devoted to Lucifer, and Abalam, two kings who serve under him but do not always accompany him. These three sources state that he rules 66 legions of spirits, some of which are of the order of Angels and the rest being Powers. The &quot;Livre des Esperitz&quot;, on the other hand, credits him with just 25 legions of spirits. Sloane MS 3824 mentions him as employing a &quot;bishop&quot; named Sperion, among other spirits.

Critical editions of the &quot;Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; list him as a former Dominion. Weyer notes a confusion over whether he was a former Dominion or Cherub. According to Thomas Rudd, King Paimon is opposed by the Shem HaMephorash angel Haziel.

== Appearance ==
In the &quot;Goetia&quot;, Weyer, de Plancy, &quot;Livre des Esperitz&quot;, &quot;Liber Officiorum Spirituum&quot;, he is described as a man riding a dromedary, preceded by men playing loud music (particularly trumpets), as well as cymbals. Sloane MS 3824 describes the camel as crowned, while the rest describe King Paimon himself as crowned. The &quot;Goetia&quot; itself makes no mention of King Paimon&#x27;s face, while the rest describe him as having a beautiful face but still refer to him as male.

== Possession ==
Sloane MS 3824 and the &quot;Liber Officiorum Spirituum&quot; describe him as having a &quot;Hoarse Voice&quot;, and those works, Weyer, and the &quot;Goetia&quot; note that he must be commanded to speak, with the &quot;Liber Officiorum Spirituum&quot; specifying that King Paimon will speak in his native language until commanded to converse in the summoner&#x27;s own language.

== Powers ==
The &quot;Goetia&quot;, Weyer, &quot;Livre des Esperitz&quot;, and the &quot;Liber Officiorum Spirituum&quot; all describe him as teaching science and answering other questions. The &quot;Goetia&quot; and Weyer specify that his knowledge includes all arts and &quot;secret things&quot;, such as knowledge regarding the Earth, its waters, and the winds. The &quot;Livre des Esperitz&quot; and the &quot;Liber Officiorum Spirituum&quot; broaden this to truthfully answering all questions asked of him, with the former source also claiming that he can reveal hidden treasures and the latter highlighting that he knows all the affairs of the world. The Goetia, Weyer, and the &quot;Livre des Esperitz&quot; also claim he has the ability to bestow dignities and lordships. The &quot;Goetia&quot; and Weyer credited him with granting familiars (who are likewise good at teaching). The &quot;Liber Officiorum Spirituum&quot; uniquely gives him command over fish. Sloane MS 3824 mentions Paimon in &quot;An Experiment to Cause a Thief to Return&quot;.

In &quot;Abramelin&quot;, King Paimo(n)&#x27;s powers include knowledge of past and future events, clearing up doubts, making spirits appear, creating visions, acquiring and dismissing servant spirits, reanimating the dead for several years, flight, remaining underwater indefinitely, and general abilities to &quot;make all kinds of things&quot; (and) &quot;all sorts of people and armor appear&quot; at the behest of the magician.

== In popular culture ==
King Paimon is the primary antagonist in Ari Aster&#x27;s 2018 film, &quot;Hereditary&quot;. A version of the Sigil of Paimon can be seen multiple times within the film, along with many other signs indicating his presence.

Paimon appears in the &quot;Helluva Boss&quot; episode &quot;The Circus&quot;. He is depicted as Stolas&#x27; father, but is neglectful, not even remembering Stolas&#x27; name because he has so many other children.

<text>Buer is a spirit that appears in the 16th-century grimoire &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot; and its derivatives, where he is described as a Great President of Hell, having fifty legions of demons under his command. He appears when the Sun is in Sagittarius. Like Chiron, the chief centaur of Greek mythology, he teaches natural and moral philosophy, logic, and the qualities and uses of all herbs and plants, and is also capable of healing all infirmities (especially of humans) and bestows good familiars.

He has been described as being a wheel with several legs, or even as a lion head with multiple goat legs. Additionally, Louis Le Breton created an illustration of Buer, later engraved by M. Jarrault, depicting the demon as having the head of a lion and five, six or more goat or horse legs surrounding his body to walk in every direction.

== In popular culture ==
Buer is portrayed as a high school teacher in the anime and manga series Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun.

Buer is the name of the Dendro Archon in 2020 video game &quot;Genshin Impact&quot;, who appears as Nahida.

<doc id="261352" wikidata="Q1702534" url="?curid=261352" title="Joint European Torus">
<text>The Joint European Torus (JET) was a magnetically confined plasma physics experiment, located at Culham Centre for Fusion Energy in Oxfordshire, UK. Based on a tokamak design, the fusion research facility was a joint European project with the main purpose of opening the way to future nuclear fusion grid energy. At the time of its design JET was larger than any comparable machine.

JET began operation in 1983 and spent most of the next decade increasing its performance in a lengthy series of experiments and upgrades. In 1991 the first experiments including tritium were made, making JET the first reactor in the world to run on the production fuel mix of 50–50 tritium and deuterium. It was also decided to add a divertor design to JET, which occurred between 1991 and 1993. Performance was significantly improved, and in 1997 JET set the record for the closest approach to scientific breakeven, reaching &quot;Q&quot; = 0.67 in 1997, producing 16 MW of fusion power while injecting 24 MW of thermal power to heat the fuel.

Between 2009 and 2011, JET was shut down to rebuild many of its parts, to adopt concepts being used in the development of the ITER project in Saint-Paul-lès-Durance, in Provence, southern France. In December 2020, a JET upgrade commenced using tritium, as part of its contribution to ITER.

Immediately after the announcement of JET&#x27;s closure at the IAEA conference in London, October 2023, the group &quot;Scientists for JET&quot; launched a petition to call for a review of the decision to close JET, with scientists fearing a research time gap and personnel loss between JET&#x27;s closure and the start of ITER&#x27;s operations.

JET finished operations in December 2023, with decommissioning expected to last until 2040.

== Purpose ==
As a large tokamak experiment, JET was designed to study plasma behaviour in conditions and dimensions approaching those required in a fusion reactor. The principal aims of the experiment were to investigate:

* the scaling of plasma behaviour as parameters approach the reactor range,
* the plasma-wall interaction in these conditions,
* the additional plasma heating (neutral beam injection, lower hybrid resonance, and ion cyclotron resonance),
* the production of alpha particles from fusion reactions, their confinement, and the consequent plasma heating (fusion self-heating).

==History==
===Background===
By the early 1960s, the fusion research community was in the doldrums. Many initially promising experimental paths had all failed to produce useful results, and the latest experiments suggested performance was stalled at the Bohm diffusion limit, far below what would be needed for a practical fusion generator.

In 1968, the Soviets held the periodic meeting of fusion researchers in Novosibirsk, where they introduced data from their T-3 tokamak. This represented a dramatic leap in fusion performance, at least 10 times what the best machines in the world had produced to that point. The results were so good that some dismissed them as faulty measurements. To counter this, the Soviets invited a team from the UK to independently test their machine. Their 1969 report confirmed the Soviet results, resulting in a &quot;veritable stampede&quot; of tokamak construction around the world.

A key issue in tokamak designs was that they did not generate enough of an electric current in their plasma to provide enough heating to bring the fuel to fusion conditions. Some sort of external heating would be required. There was no shortage of ideas for this, and in the mid-1970s a series of machines were built around the world to explore these concepts. One of these, the Princeton Large Torus (PLT) demonstrated that neutral beam injection was a workable concept, using it to reach record temperatures well over the 50 million K that is the minimum needed for a practical reactor.

With the PLT&#x27;s success, the path to scientific breakeven finally appeared possible after decades of effort. Scientific breakeven is the point where the power produced by the fusion reactions is equal to the amount of power injected to heat the plasma. Once breakeven is achieved, even small improvements from that point begin to rapidly increase the amount of net energy being released. Teams around the world began planning for a new generation of machines combining PLT&#x27;s injectors with superconducting magnets and vacuum vessels that could hold deuterium-tritium fuel instead of the test fuels containing pure deuterium or hydrogen that had been used up to that point.

===European design===

In 1971, the member states of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) decided in favour of a robust fusion programme and provided the necessary legal framework for a European fusion device to be developed. In 1975, the first proposals for the JET machine were completed. Detailed design took three years. At the end of 1977, after a long debate, Culham was chosen as the host site for the new design. Funding was approved on 1 April 1978 as the &quot;JET Joint Undertaking&quot; legal entity.

The reactor was built at a new site next to the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, the UK&#x27;s fusion research laboratory which opened in 1965. The construction of the buildings was undertaken by Tarmac Construction, starting in 1978 with the Torus Hall. The Hall was completed in January 1982 and construction of the JET machine itself began immediately after the completion of the Torus Hall. The cost was 198.8 million European Units of Account (a predecessor of the euro) or 438 million in 2014 US dollars.

JET was one of only two tokamak models designed to work with a real deuterium-tritium fuel mix, the other being the US-built TFTR. Both were built with the hope of reaching &quot;scientific breakeven&quot; where the &quot;fusion energy gain factor&quot; or &quot;Q&quot; = 1.0.

JET achieved its first plasma on 25 June 1983. It was officially opened on 9 April 1984 by Queen Elizabeth II. On 9 November 1991, JET performed the world&#x27;s first deuterium-tritium experiment. This beat the US&#x27;s machine, TFTR, by a full two years.

===Upgrades===
Although very successful, JET and its counterpart TFTR failed to reach scientific breakeven. This was due to a variety of effects that had not been seen in previous machines operating at lower densities and pressures. Based on these results, and a number of advances in plasma shaping and divertor design, a new tokamak layout emerged, sometimes known as an &quot;advanced tokamak&quot;. An advanced tokamak capable of reaching scientific breakeven would have to be very large and very expensive, which led to the international effort ITER.

In 1991, the first experiments including tritium were made, allowing JET to run on the production fuel of a 50–50 mix of tritium and deuterium. It was also decided at this time to add a divertor, allowing removal of waste material from the plasma. Performance was significantly improved, allowing JET to set many records in terms of confinement time, temperature and fusion triple product. In 1997, JET set the record for the closest approach to scientific breakeven. It attained &quot;Q&quot; = 0.67, producing 16 MW of fusion energy while injecting 24 MW of thermal power to heat the fuel, a record that endured until 2021. This was also the record for greatest fusion power produced.

In 1998, JET&#x27;s engineers developed a remote handling system with which, for the first time, it was possible to exchange certain components using artificial hands only. A &quot;Remote Handling&quot; system is, in general, an essential tool for any subsequent fusion power plant and especially for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) being developed at Saint-Paul-lès-Durance, in Provence, southern France. This Remote Handling system was later to lead on to become RACE (Remote Applications in Challenging Environments).

In 1999, the European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA) was established with responsibility for the future collective use of JET.

===ITER design work===
In October 2009, a 15-month shutdown period was started to rebuild many parts of the JET to adopt concepts being used in the development of the ITER project in Saint-Paul-lès-Durance, in Provence, southern France. This including replacing carbon components in the vacuum vessel with tungsten and beryllium ones.

In mid-May 2011, the shutdown reached its end. The first experimental campaign after the installation of the &quot;ITER-Like Wall&quot; started on 2 September 2011.

On 14 July 2014, the European Commission signed a contract worth €283m for another 5-year extension so more advanced higher energy research can be performed at JET.

===Post-Brexit===
Brexit threw the plans for JET in doubt. As part of its plan to leave the EU, the UK was to leave Euratom, which provides the funding for JET. Talks on the funding after 2018, when the 5-year plan expired, commenced and a new agreement to extend JET&#x27;s operation until 2019 or 2020 appeared to be largely complete. These talks were put on hold after the Brexit announcement. However, in March 2019, the UK Government and European Commission signed a contract extension for JET. This guaranteed JET operations until the end of 2024 regardless of Brexit situation. In December 2020, a JET upgrade commenced using tritium, as part of its contribution to ITER.

On 21 December 2021, JET produced 59 megajoules using deuterium-tritium fuel while sustaining fusion during a five-second pulse, beating its previous record of 21.7 megajoules with Q = 0.33, set in 1997.

In October 2023, JET set its final fusion energy record, producing 69.29 megajoules over 6 seconds from only 0.21 mg of D-T fuel. In November 2023, a petition asking that JET not be closed was started, with scientists fearing a research time gap and personnel loss between JET&#x27;s closure and the start of ITER&#x27;s operations. Operations ceased in December 2023, after performing 105,842 pulses, with decommissioning expected to last until 2040. The final pulses were used to operate JET outside of its design capabilities. The decommissioning and repurposing process is expected to last until 2040.

===Petition against the closure of JET===
Immediately after the announcement of JET&#x27;s closure at the IAEA conference in London, October 2023, the group &quot;Scientists for JET&quot; launched a petition to call for a review of the decision to close JET.
 The scientists are concerned that JET&#x27;s end date was set assuming that ITER would be up and running by that date to continue fusion experiments, but with ITER&#x27;s startup being postponed and ITER&#x27;s deuterium-tritium (D-T) reactions only scheduled for 2039, that there will be a gap of many years with no fusion research.

== Description ==
JET has a major radius of 3 metres, and the D-shaped vacuum chamber is 2.5 metres wide and 4.2 metres high. The total plasma volume within it is 100 cubic metres, about 100 times larger than the largest machine in production when the JET design began.

JET was one of the first tokamaks to be designed to use a D-shaped vacuum chamber. This was initially considered as a way to improve the safety factor, but during the design, it was also noticed that this would make it much easier to build the system mechanically, as it reduced the net forces across the chamber that are trying to force the torus towards the centre of the major axis. Ideally, the magnets surrounding the chamber should be more curved at the top and bottom and less on the inside and outsides in order to support these forces, which leads to something like an oval shape that the D closely approximated. The flatter shape on the inside edge was also easier to support due to the larger, flatter surface.

While exploring the stability of various plasma shapes on a computer, the team noticed that non-circular plasmas did not exactly cancel out the vertical drift that the twisted fields have originally been introduced to solve. If the plasma was displaced up or down, it would continue travelling in that direction. However, the simulations demonstrated that the drift rate was slow enough that it could be counteracted using additional magnets and an electronic feedback system.

The primary magnetic field in a tokamak is supplied by a series of magnets ringing the vacuum chamber. In JET, these are a series of 32 copper-wound magnets, each one weighing 12 tonnes. In total, they carry a current of 51 MA, and as they had to do so for periods of tens of seconds, they are water cooled. When operating, the coil is attempting to expand with a force of 6 MN, there is a net field towards the centre of the major axis of 20 MN, and a further twisting force because the poloidal field inside the plasma is in different directions on the top and bottom. All of these forces are borne on the external structure.

Surrounding the entire assembly is the 2,600 tonne eight-limbed transformer which is used to induce a current into the plasma. The primary purpose of this current is to generate a poloidal field that mixes with the one supplied by the toroidal magnets to produce the twisted field inside the plasma. The current also serves the secondary purpose of ionizing the fuel and providing some heating of the plasma before other systems take over.

The main source of heating in JET is provided by two systems, positive ion neutral beam injection and ion cyclotron resonance heating. The former uses small particle accelerators to shoot fuel atoms into the plasma, where collisions cause the atoms to ionize and become trapped with the rest of the fuel. These collisions deposit the kinetic energy of the accelerators into the plasma. Ion cyclotron resonance heating is essentially the plasma equivalent of a microwave oven, using radio waves to pump energy into the ions directly by matching their cyclotron frequency. JET was designed so it would initially be built with a few megawatts of both sources, and then later be expanded to as much of 25 MW of neutral beams and 15 MW of cyclotron heating.

JET&#x27;s power requirements during the plasma pulse are around 500 MW with peak in excess of 1000 MW. Because power draw from the main grid is limited to 575 MW, two large flywheel generators were constructed to provide this necessary power. Each 775-ton flywheel can spin up to 225 rpm and store 3.75 GJ, roughly the same amount of kinetic energy as a train weighing 5,000 tons traveling at . Each flywheel uses 8.8 MW to spin up and can generate 400 MW (briefly).

<text>Emmanuel Logroño (born November 1, 1951), better known as Sunshine Logroño, is a Puerto Rican actor. Logroño has worked in Puerto Rican media for close to five decades.

==Early years==
Born in New York to a Puerto Rican mother, Logroño moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico along with his family when he was nine years old. He was soon recognized as a multifaceted entertainer by his schoolteachers and classmates. His nickname &quot;Sunshine&quot; came from a short stint (1973) as a disc jockey for San Juan-based WBMJ-AM, Puerto Rico&#x27;s first rock and roll station (another WBMJ disc jockey at the time, Raymond Broussard, better known as &quot;Moonshadow&quot;, later became the co-host of El Vacilón de la Mañana, a very popular Spanish language morning radio talk show in New York City). Sunshine was also heard in 1974 as a part of the new announcing crew at &quot;The New WRAI&quot; 1520, a station created by Bill Thompson and &quot;Radio Man&quot; after the format change from English to Spanish at WBMJ. Besides his short stint as a disc jockey, Logroño served as a voice actor for Puerto Rico&#x27;s then-active dubbing industry. His was the Spanish-language voice for &quot;Little Joe&quot;, one of the Cartwright brothers (played by Michael Landon) in the U.S. television show Bonanza.

Logroño obtained a Bachelor of Arts (English Language Literature) degree (&quot;a degree in unemployment&quot;, Logroño claims) from the University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras and a Master of Arts (Theater) degree from Michigan State University. After his return to Puerto Rico, Logroño was a member of the Puerto Rican folk group, &quot;Moliendo Vidrio&quot;, which also starred bandleader Gary Nuñez and later comedic actress Carmen Nydia Velázquez. Moliendo Vidrio made a few albums during the 1970s. By the late years of that decade, the group disbanded.

Logroño kept himself busy in the late 1970s as a voice talent for radio commercials, as a comedic actor on Puerto Rican television, and as a radio host. He co-hosted a morning radio program, &quot;Rompiendo el Día&quot; (Daybreak) with Puerto Rican entrepreneur and musician Silverio Pérez, and served as part of the comedic team behind &quot;Desafiando a los Genios&quot; (Defying the Geniuses), a popular TV mock quiz show starring, among others, actor, writer and film director Jacobo Morales and Puerto Rico&#x27;s premier comedic actor, José Miguel Agrelot. Two of Logroño&#x27;s TV characters would surface around this time: &quot;Agapito Flores&quot;, a rather naive country bumpkin with a speech impairment, and &quot;Nicky El Bro&quot;, a Nuyorican hustler. A third character, &quot;Chinito Rivera&quot; (a flasher that said little and wore a raincoat he was eager to open at the slightest provocation) would eventually evolve into &quot;El Barbarazo del Amor&quot;, one of his radio characters.

==&quot;Los Rayos Gamma&quot;==
Morales and Perez would soon revive, along with actor and radio announcer Horacio Olivo, a musical group named &quot;Los Rayos Gamma&quot;, Puerto Rico&#x27;s most beloved political satire troupe, which had an extremely short but popular stint in 1968 as the creative vehicle for the late satirical writer and journalist, Eddie López. Logroño filled in for Pérez on vacation, and when Pérez returned, he was allowed to fill in López&#x27;s shoes (who was considered irreplaceable by some), with great success. &quot;Los Rayos Gamma&quot; had a television show on channel 7 where they satirized politicians with their songs to high ratings and which would be taken off the air due to their rather direct satirical jabs at then-governor of Puerto Rico Carlos Romero Barceló. They went on to make a few albums and would return to the public spotlight in roughly four-year intervals, coinciding with each general election in Puerto Rico.

At his initial stages in &quot;Los Rayos Gamma&quot;, Logroño created a character that seemed to lighten up the absurdity and gravity of another character, played by Morales, that was in turn based on a real-life incident. During the 1930s, Dr. Cornelius P. Rhoads, in charge of health services for the Institute of Tropical Medicine in San Juan, wrote a few letters to friends in the United States in which he described his hatred for Puerto Ricans. Whether the letters were in jest or not, he claimed in them to have implanted cancer cells in local subjects without their consent. One of these letters was intercepted by affiliates to Pedro Albizu Campos&#x27;s Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico, and Albizu vehemently denounced Rhoades as an unethical and sadistic doctor who treated his patients as guinea pigs. At their television show, Morales played a descendant of Rhoads, &quot;Dr. Cornelius Rodas&quot;; Logroño played his assistant, Igor, wearing a fake hunch, doing guttural noises, and inevitably messing up whatever plans Rodas had for his avowed plans to exterminate Puerto Ricans. Igor reportedly was created when Rodas submitted an unwilling participant to a 23-hour long orgasm using Frankenstein-like electrodes. Igor was a big fan of Puerto Rican culture, Van Halen and pornography, and walked around with a small doll, &quot;Calerito&quot;, resembling him, a comedic device that preceded Mini Me by many years. Due to the physical demands on him while playing the character, Logroño has since played Igor only sporadically. A big fan of the character, who got &quot;Igor&quot; as a nickname when he imitated him in high school for his friends, is Juan Gonzalez, the Major League Baseball player.

Los Rayos Gamma edited a music album in 1982, from which &quot;Me apesta la vida&quot; (&quot;My Life Stinks&quot;), a funk-meets-rap fusion song penned by Logroño, was a minor radio hit in Puerto Rico. Logroño updated the song in a newer version, found in the 2006 Culebro Mendoza album &quot;Culebro Legal&quot;, this time set to a hip-hop beat.

==Later years==
After &quot;Los Rayos Gamma&quot;&#x27;s TV show was yanked off the air, Sunshine kept active, doing voice-overs for commercials (at one time half of all radio commercials in Puerto Rico featured Logroño&#x27;s talents in one way or another) and making appearances at several TV shows and radio programs. At one of these shows the comedic characters of Eleuterio Quiñones and his son Elpidio were born. Eleuterio Quiñones, a die-hard supporter of Puerto Rican statehood whose grasp of public affairs and general culture level would be best compared to those of Archie Bunker in the U.S., and his son Elpidio -a 38-year-old special education patient with the emotional age of a child but with rather stunning reproductive organs - are still a staple of Puerto Rican radio and television. Logroño also developed his own audio production company, Man-TK Records (Man-TK being a pun on &quot;manteca&quot;, the Spanish word for lard. Logroño&#x27;s work is filled with porcine references throughout his career).

===Sunshine&#x27;s Café===
In 1988 Logroño began hosting a show named &quot;Sunshine&#x27;s Cafe&quot; on WAPA-TV. &quot;Sunshine&#x27;s Cafe&quot; was very popular among Puerto Rico&#x27;s television viewers and its &quot;risqué&quot; sense of humor guaranteed four seasons of high ratings and extreme controversy. After the show&#x27;s first airing all sponsors except one canceled their contracts, and the program spent close to six months without advertising. The program was controversial because it confronted many Puerto Rican stereotypes head-on. It also provided Logroño with a vehicle to bring in many taboo topics in subtext, a technique that he personally credits Bill Cosby with teaching him when Cosby developed a pilot for a Latino-based series in American television that did not evolve into a series.

In the program, Sunshine played many characters; one particular character portrayed a clever closet homosexual named &quot;Vitín Alicea Arévalo&quot;, many of whose phrases became household sayings. Another character portrayed a fake Pentecostal minister, &quot;El Hermano Emmanuel&quot; (Brother Emmanuel), who had a hunch (mirroring that of a famous Puerto Rican minister, Yiye Avila), was constantly angry (as yet another local minister, Jorge Raschke), frequently schemed to profit from the members of his congregation, and almost always was caught doing so. El Hermano Emmanuel constantly spoke trilling r&#x27;s (and was often referred to as &quot;Hermano Emmanuerrrrr&quot;), and used a phrase mocking speaking in tongues: &quot;&quot;¡Salamaya!&quot; (derived from &quot;¡Sea la madre&quot;!&quot;, or &quot;[Damned] be his mother!&quot;) as a punchline, particularly whenever the Hermano met a stunningly attractive woman, or when another character caught him in a profiteering scheme. A famous episode had the Hermano try (unsuccessfully) to cure José Feliciano from his blindness (Feliciano&#x27;s memorable response was: &quot;I can see! I can see! I can see that you&#x27;re a fake, I still can&#x27;t see a damn!&quot;)

The phrase &quot;Salamaya&quot;&quot; is still used in Puerto Rico to refer in jest to devout Pentecostal followers (Hermano Emmanuel constantly had two naive female parishioners follow him everywhere) or a small Pentecostal congregation (particularly those with rudimentary facilities, such as tents). Rapper René Pérez (&quot;Residente&quot;) uses it in the Calle 13&quot; song &quot;Ojalai&quot; to describe the song&#x27;s attractive female subject in rapture-like amazement.

Offended by Logroño&#x27;s portrayal of ministers, Pentecostal leaders in Puerto Rico threatened Logroño&#x27;s program with boycotts, and Raschke and Milton Picón (the local representative for Morality in Media) actually confronted him on television talk shows. On a rare bow to public pressure, Logroño discontinued the character (&quot;If I keep on doing it their followers will lynch me!&quot;, he gives as an explanation).

===Chona, La Puerca Asesina===
In exchange for a cameo in the film &quot;La Guagua Aérea&quot;, Logroño somehow persuaded film maker Luis Molina Casanova to direct a satirical action film, &quot;Chona, La Puerca Asesina&quot; (&quot;Chona, The Killer Pig&quot;), released in 1988 and filmed in black and white. Many Puerto Rican artists and media personalities (along with Argentine actor Pablo Alarcón, who played a Puerto Rican peasant with a strong Argentine accent) appeared in the film, in which a piglet grows to become ten stories tall and attacks Puerto Rico, Godzilla-style. Among the cameos and film roles are those played by José Miguel Agrelot, Nena Rivera, Wilson Torres (later known for another comedic character named &quot;Maneco&quot;), Guillermo José Torres, Enrique Cruz, Antonio Pantojas and others (Ruth Fernández sings the movie&#x27;s theme, her trademark song &quot;Gracias, Mundo&quot;). Jacobo Morales and Logroño appear as Cornelius Rodas and Igor, respectively; Rodas is responsible for enlarging the pig, as requested by Don Rodriguez, one of Agrelot&#x27;s many comedic characters. A remasterized version, or director&#x27;s cut, which adds Vitín Alicea to the plot and features improved sound effects, was released in DVD format in 1998.

In 1991, Logroño had a chance to star in a Hollywood movie: he acted opposite Martin Short and Kurt Russell in &quot;Captain Ron&quot;. He appeared in the movie &quot;Contact&quot;, alongside Jodie Foster, as a taxi driver, but actually - thanks to the rather extreme talents of the film&#x27;s editor, Logroño claims - only his left elbow appears on the screen. He won the audition over Rafael Fuentes much to his dismay.

According to an interview that Logroño gave Vea one time, one day, he arrived at his office to learn there was an audition for another movie. By his own account, he caught a flight to New York City, made the audition, and flew back to Puerto Rico, arriving just in time to participate at a play in Mayagüez.

Logroño attempted to show his serious actor side in the late 1990s, participating in various theater plays.

=== More recent history ===
He was the host of a show named &quot;De Noche Con Iris y Sunshine&quot; (&quot;At Night With Iris &amp; Sunshine&quot;), co-hosted by Iris Chacón. When Iris later left the show for personal reasons, it was renamed to &quot;De Noche con Sunshine&quot; (At Night With Sunshine). In a controversial network switch Sunshine switched to WAPA-TV in 1998 and was the host of a show named &quot;Club Sunshine&quot;, which was aired until May 2009. During that time in WAPA-TV he was also the vice-president for talent affairs of the television station. &quot;Club Sunshine&quot; was followed up by &quot;Sunshine Remix&quot; (later retitled &quot;El Remix&quot;) and &quot;Risas en Combo&quot;, both aired on WAPA-TV in an alternating season-wise fashion until both were replaced together by &quot;El Remix&quot; alone, which still airs on WAPA as of 2019.

On February 25, 2007, Logroño appeared as an archbishop in the filming of the video for Calle 13&#x27;s &quot;Tango del Pecado&quot;, the first featured single of their recent album, &quot;¿Residente o Visitante?&quot;. He marries Calle 13&#x27;s René Pérez and ex-girlfriend Denise Quiñones in a surrealistic wedding where Tego Calderón and Voltio are the best men. On March 21, 2007, Logroño released a children&#x27;s book, &quot;El coquí que quiso ser sapo&quot; (The coquí who wanted to be a bullfrog), based on a story he once developed and recorded as part of a children stories&#x27; album for the &quot;Museo del Niño&quot; (Children&#x27;s Museum) in San Juan. A children&#x27;s musical play based on the book was produced in Puerto Rico in April 2008.

Sunshine has been hosting the afternoon radio show &quot;Agitando El Show&quot; since 1997, with Fernando Arévalo. The show has one of the biggest audiences and is one of the longest running shows in local radio.

During 2014, Logroño became involved in a dispute with television personality Josué Carrión over a section of Logroño&#x27;s show, &quot;El Tiempo es Poco&quot;, which mocked Carrión&#x27;s television show &quot;El Tiempo Es Oro&quot;. Logroño decided to cancel the section, much like during the 1980s, when he had a similar situation in which he mocked journalist and emcee Ivan Frontera, who got murdered early in 1985, causing the cancellation of Logroño&#x27;s character, &quot;Ivan Fontecha&quot;, during Logroño&#x27;s shows.

<doc id="261356" wikidata="Q7097685" url="?curid=261356" title="Operation Veritas">
<text>Operation Veritas was the codename used for British military operations against the Taliban government of Afghanistan in 2001. British forces played a supporting role to the American Operation Enduring Freedom. In addition, the British contribution was an important part of the overall forces deployed. Operation Veritas also incorporated Operation Oracle, Operation Fingal, and Operation Jacana. It was succeeded by Operation Herrick.

Many British forces were on exercise Saif Sareea II in Oman when the September 11 attacks occurred. This allowed for the swift deployment of some to Afghanistan for operations against the Taliban.

==First rotation==
The first rotation of forces left in place after the war started included:
* HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot;
* HMS &quot;Fearless&quot;
* HMS &quot;Cornwall&quot;
* HMS &quot;Nottingham&quot;
* HMS &quot;Southampton&quot;
* HMS &quot;Trafalgar&quot;
* HMS &quot;Triumph&quot;
* HMS &quot;Beagle&quot;
* RFA &quot;Sir Tristram&quot;
* RFA &quot;Sir Percivale&quot;
* RFA &quot;Fort Victoria&quot;
* RFA &quot;Fort Rosalie&quot;
* RFA &quot;Bayleaf&quot;
* RFA &quot;Brambleleaf&quot;
* RFA &quot;Diligence&quot;
2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment
40 Commando, Royal Marines was assigned as infantry for the operation, the unit initially deployed only C Coy and B Coy from Diego Garcia BIOT to Bagram in mid November 2001 to support UKSF operations. They were later relieved by A Coy (40 Cdo RM) in mid March 2002, prior to 45 Commando Royal Marines deployment in Operation Anaconda. A Coy were subsequently relieved in June 2002 by B Coy, who were based there until Oct 2002.
==Second rotation==
In March 2002, the initial naval force were relieved by one centred on HMS &quot;Ocean&quot;, carrying 45 Commando Royal Marines. &quot;Sir Tristram&quot; and &quot;Sir Percivale&quot; remained in the area. The other ships in that force were:
* HMS &quot;Ocean&quot;
* HMS &quot;York&quot;
* HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot;
* HMS &quot;Portland&quot;
* RFA &quot;Fort George&quot;
* RFA &quot;Fort Austin&quot;

In addition to the naval taskforces present, a substantial RAF presence in the region was extant. Tristar and VC10 tankers refuelled British and US Navy aircraft. Nimrod and Canberra aircraft performed electronic and photo reconnaissance, and Nimrods also conducted maritime patrol operations. Sentry AWACS aircraft were also deployed.

2 CH47 Chinooks from 27 Squadron RAF were deployed, initially aboard HMS Illustrious in October 2001 and redeployed from HMS Ocean to Bagram on the night of 26 March 2002, to be joined by a further 3 CH47 deployed from the UK by C17 aircraft from 99 Squadron. The Chinooks remained at Bagram to support the 45 Commando deployment, returning to RAF Odiham later that year.

==Post operation==
After the main combat operations were over, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was established in Kabul with Bravo Company 40 Commando providing protection. It was under British leadership for the first few months of its existence, and British troops are still involved with the force in 2006. 45 Commando deployed into Afghanistan from HMS &quot;Ocean&quot; in March 2002, and conducted several search and destroy operations until July. It did not contact the enemy during that time period.

On 25 August 2004, it was announced by Secretary of State for Defence Geoff Hoon that 6 RAF Harrier GR7 from No. 3 Squadron would be deployed to Afghanistan. This was the first deployment to Afghanistan of RAF fighter aircraft and they are intended to provide close air support (CAS) and reconnaissance for ISAF and Coalition forces.

==Commanders==
The following have been UK National Contingent Commander for Operation Veritas:
* 2001 Lieutenant Colonel Henry Worsley
* September 2001 to January 2002, Air Marshal Jock Stirrup

<doc id="261358" wikidata="Q1756808" url="?curid=261358" title="Rete mirabile">
<text>A rete mirabile (Latin for &quot;wonderful net&quot;; : retia mirabilia) is a complex of arteries and veins lying very close to each other, found in some vertebrates, mainly warm-blooded ones. The rete mirabile utilizes countercurrent blood flow within the net (blood flowing in opposite directions) to act as a countercurrent exchanger. It exchanges heat, ions, or gases between vessel walls so that the two bloodstreams within the rete maintain a gradient with respect to temperature, or concentration of gases or solutes. This term was coined by Galen.

== Effectiveness ==
The effectiveness of retia is primarily determined by how readily the heat, ions, or gases can be exchanged. For a given length, they are most effective with respect to gases or heat, then small ions, and decreasingly so with respect to other substances.

The retia can provide for extremely efficient exchanges. In bluefin tuna, for example, nearly all of the metabolic heat in the venous blood is transferred to the arterial blood, thus conserving muscle temperature; that heat exchange approaches 99% efficiency.

== Birds ==
In birds with webbed feet, retia mirabilia in the legs and feet transfer heat from the outgoing (hot) blood in the arteries to the incoming (cold) blood in the veins. The effect of this biological heat exchanger is that the internal temperature of the feet is much closer to the ambient temperature, thus reducing heat loss. Penguins also have them in the flippers and nasal passages.

Seabirds distill seawater using countercurrent exchange in a so-called salt gland with a rete mirabile. The gland secretes highly concentrated brine stored near the nostrils above the beak. The bird then &quot;sneezes&quot; the brine out. As freshwater is not usually available in their environments, some seabirds, such as pelicans, petrels, albatrosses, gulls and terns, possess this gland, which allows them to drink the salty water from their environments while they are hundreds of miles away from land.

== Fish ==
Fish have evolved retia mirabilia multiple times to raise the temperature (endothermy) or the oxygen concentration of a body part above the ambient level.

In many fish, a rete mirabile helps fill the swim bladder with oxygen, increasing the fish&#x27;s buoyancy. The rete mirabile is an essential part of the system that pumps dissolved oxygen from a low partial pressure (formula_1) of 0.2 atmospheres into a gas filled bladder that is at a pressure of hundreds of atmospheres. A rete mirabile called the choroid rete mirabile is found in most living teleosts and raises the formula_1 of the retina. The higher supply of oxygen allows the teleost retina to be thick and have few blood vessels thereby increasing its sensitivity to light. In addition to raising the formula_1, the choroid rete has evolved to raise the temperature of the eye in some teleosts and sharks.

A countercurrent exchange system is utilized between the venous and arterial capillaries. Lowering the pH levels in the venous capillaries causes oxygen to unbind from blood hemoglobin because of the Root effect. This causes an increase in venous blood oxygen partial pressure, allowing the oxygen to diffuse through the capillary membrane and into the arterial capillaries, where oxygen is still sequestered to hemoglobin. The cycle of diffusion continues until the partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial capillaries exceeds that in the swim bladder. At this point, the dissolved oxygen in the arterial capillaries diffuses into the swim bladder via the gas gland.

The rete mirabile allows for an increase in muscle temperature in regions where this network of vein and arteries is found. The fish is able to thermoregulate certain areas of its body. Additionally, this increase in temperature leads to an increase in basal metabolic temperature. The fish is now able to split ATP at a higher rate and ultimately can swim faster.

The opah utilizes retia mirabilia to conserve heat, making it the newest addition to the list of regionally endothermic fish. Blood traveling through capillaries in the gills must carry cold blood due to their exposure to cold water, but retia mirabilia in the opah&#x27;s gills are able to transfer heat from warm blood in arterioles coming from the heart that heats this colder blood in arterioles leaving the gills. The huge pectoral muscles of the opah, which generate most of the body heat, are thus able to control the temperature of the rest of the body.

==Mammals==

In mammals, an elegant rete mirabile in the efferent arterioles of juxtamedullary glomeruli is important in maintaining the hypertonicity of the renal medulla. It is the hypertonicity of this zone, resorbing water osmotically from the renal collecting ducts as they exit the kidney, that makes possible the excretion of a hypertonic urine and maximum conservation of body water.

Vascular retia mirabilia are also found in the limbs of a range of mammals. These reduce the temperature in the extremities. Some of these probably function to prevent heat loss in cold conditions by reducing the temperature gradient between the limb and the environment. Others reduce the temperature of the testes increasing their productivity. In the neck of the dog, a rete mirabile protects the brain when the body overheats during hunting; the venous blood is cooled down by panting before entering the net.

Retia mirabilia also occur frequently in mammals that burrow, dive or have arboreal lifestyles that involve clinging with the limbs for lengthy periods. In the last case, slow-moving arboreal mammals such as sloths, lorises and arboreal anteaters possess retia of the highly developed type known as vascular bundles. The structure and function of these mammalian retia mirabilia are reviewed by O&#x27;Dea (1990).

The ancient physician Galen mistakenly thought that humans also have a rete mirabile in the neck, apparently based on dissection of sheep and misidentifying the results with the human carotid sinus, and ascribed important properties to it; it fell to Berengario da Carpi first, and then to Vesalius to demonstrate the error.

<text>Lake Mweru (also spelled &quot;Mwelu&quot;, &quot;Mwero&quot;) () is a freshwater lake on the longest arm of Africa&#x27;s second-longest river, the Congo. Located on the border between Zambia and Democratic Republic of the Congo, it makes up of the total length of the Congo, lying between its Luapula River (upstream) and Luvua River (downstream) segments.

Mweru means &#x27;lake&#x27; in a number of Bantu languages, so it is often referred to as just &#x27;Mweru&#x27;.

==Physical geography==
Mweru is mainly fed by the Luapula River, which comes in through swamps from the south, and the Kalungwishi River from the east. At its north end the lake is drained by the Luvua River, which flows in a northwesterly direction to join the Lualaba River and thence to the Congo. It is the second-largest lake in the Congo&#x27;s drainage basin and is located west of the southern end of the largest, Lake Tanganyika.

The Luapula forms a swampy delta almost as wide as the southern end of the lake. In a number of respects, the lower river and lake can be treated as one entity. For a lake in a region with pronounced wet and dry seasons, Mweru does not change much in level and area. The annual fluctuation in level is , with seasonal highs in May and lows in January. This is partly because the Luapula drains out of the Bangweulu Swamps and floodplain which tend to regulate the water flow, absorbing the annual flood and releasing it slowly, and partly because Mweru&#x27;s outlet, the Luvua, drops quickly and flows swiftly, without vegetation to block it. A rise in Mweru is quickly offset by a faster flow down the Luvua.

Mweru&#x27;s average length is and its average width is , with its long axis oriented northeast–southwest. Its elevation is , quite a bit higher than Tanganyika (). It is a rift valley lake lying in the Lake Mweru-Luapula graben, which is a branch of the East African Rift. The western shore of the lake in DR Congo exhibits the steep escarpment typical of a rift valley lake, rising to the Kundelungu Mountains beyond, but the rift valley escarpment is less pronounced on the eastern shore.

Mweru is shallow in the south and deeper in the north, with two depressions in the north-eastern section with maximum depths of .

A smaller very marshy lake called Mweru Wantipa (also known as the Mweru Marshes) lies about to its east, and north of the Kalungwishi. It is mostly endorheic and actually takes water from the Kalungwishi through a dambo most of the time, but in times of high flood it may overflow into the Kalungwishi and Lake Mweru.

==Human geography==

===Exploration===

The lake was known to Arab and Swahili traders (of ivory, copper and slaves) who used Kilwa Island on the lake as a base at one time. They used trade routes from Zanzibar on the Indian Ocean to Ujiji on Lake Tanganyika to Mweru and then to the Lunda, Luba, Yeke or Kazembe kingdoms, the last being on the southern shores of Mweru. Western trade routes went from those kingdoms to the Atlantic, so Mweru lay on a transcontinental trade route.

Between 1796 and 1831 Portuguese traders/explorers Pereira, Francisco de Lacerda and others visited Kazembe from Mozambique to get treaties to use the trade route between their territories of Mozambique and Angola. The Portuguese must have known of the lake, and the visitors only had to walk to higher ground about north of Kazembe&#x27;s Kanyembo capital to see the lake distant. However, they were more interested in trade routes than discovery, they had approached from the south and their movements were restricted by Mwata Kazembe, and they did not provide an account of it. Explorer and missionary David Livingstone, who referred to it as &#x27;Moero&#x27;, is credited with its discovery during his travels of 1867-&#x27;8.

Livingstone witnessed the devastation and suffering caused by the slave trade in the area to the north and east of Mweru, and his accounts did help rally opposition to it. The last of the slave trading in the area was as late as the 1890s, however. Meanwhile, between 1870 and 1891, skirmishes and wars between the Yeke king Msiri and neighbouring chiefs and traders unsettled the area. Few Europeans had visited Mweru since Livingstone, until Alfred Sharpe in 1890–1 and the Stairs Expedition in 1892 both passed by on their way to seek treaties with Msiri. The Stairs Expedition killed Msiri and took Katanga for the King Leopold II of Belgium. Sharpe left one of his officers to set up the first colonial outpost in the Luapula-Mweru valley, the British boma at Chiengi in 1891.

===Historical development===
The western shore of Luapula-Mweru became part of the Belgian Congo and the eastern shore part of Northern Rhodesia, a British protectorate. Lake Mweru to Tanganyika is an area which was exposed to European influence at a very early date, when the lakes were the chief entrance to Northern Rhodesia. Although Kilwa Island is closer to the western shore, it was allocated to Northern Rhodesia, and consequently Zambia has 58% of the lake waters, and DR Congo 42%.

The first Belgian outposts on the lake were set up at Lukonzolwa and Pweto which were at various times the headquarters of their administration of Katanga. They stamped out the slave trade going north-east around the lake. The first mission station on the lake was established in 1892 by Scottish missionary Dan Crawford of the Plymouth Brethren at Luanza on the Belgian side of the lake.

The British moved their boma from Chiengi to the Kalungwishi, with one or two British officers (such as Blair Watson), and a force of African police. In conjunction with operations around Abercorn further down the trade route, this was enough to end the slave trade going east from Mweru, but not enough to bring Mwata Kazembe under British rule, and a military expedition had to be sent in 1899 from British Central Africa (Nyasaland) to do that job (see the article on Alfred Sharpe for more details).

The move of the boma from Chiengi to Kalungwishi had the effect of leaving the Belgian boma at Pweto a free rein at the northern end of the lake, leading a hundred years later to about of Zambian territory next to Pweto being ceded to the DR Congo (then Zaire). See the Luapula Province border dispute for further details and references.

After 1900, the Belgian Congo province of Katanga on the western shores of the lake developed faster than the Northern Rhodesian side, the Luapula Province and the town of Kasenga a few hours by boat up the Luapula River became the most developed in the Luapula-Mweru valley, and until the 1960s was the main commercial centre with better services and infrastructure than elsewhere. The Elizabethville mines started up more quickly than those of the Copperbelt, and Kasenga supplied its workforce with fish. Since 1960, political crises, government neglect and wars on the Congolese side have produced a deterioration in infrastructure, while peace on the Zambian side has produced an increase in population and services, causing the balance to change.

===Centres of population===

Many fishing villages dot Mweru&#x27;s shores. A number are seasonal camps. The main towns on the Zambian side are Nchelenge, Kashikishi and Chiengi, and on the DR Congo side, Kilwa (the town opposite the island), Lukonzolwa and Pweto.

Besides Kilwa Island, there are two other inhabited islands in the lake: Zambia&#x27;s Isokwe Island of , and a Congolese island next to the mouth of the Luapula. (Two other islands in the Luapula swamps have shores on the lake).

The Congolese side of the lake was affected by the Second Congo War of 1999–2003, from which it is still recovering. Many refugees entered Zambia at Pweto and were accommodated in camps in Mporokoso and Kawambwa districts.

===Transport===

The Belgians operated a regular service by a paddle steamer, the &quot;Charles Lemaire&quot;, between Kasenga on the Luapula and Pweto at the outlet of the Luvua River, a distance of nearly if a stop at Kilwa was included. Boats still ply that route today. Water transport is less used on the Zambian side, except to Kilwa Island, Isokwe Island and Chisenga Island (in the Luapula swamps).

The Mweru area was served only by dirt roads until the main Luapula Province road on the Zambian side was tarred to Nchelenge in 1987; the population around the lake has grown, much of it exploiting the rich fishery of the lake. When the Copperbelt mines shed workers in the 1980s and 1990s, many ex-miners relocated to the lake shores, particularly around Nchelenge-Kashikishi.

The dirt roads on the Congolese side have been neglected and are in poor condition, and many people cross into Zambia to travel by road. See Congo Pedicle road for more details.

===Fishery===

Mweru has always been noted for its longfin tilapia, (&quot;Oreochromis macrochir&quot;), called &quot;pale&quot; (&#x27;pa-lay&#x27;) in Chibemba, which traditionally were dried on racks or mats in the sun and packed in baskets for market. (Smoking and salting fish are more recent processes in the area). Catfish (one species of which grows up to in length), a kind of carp, tigerfish, elephantfish and sardine-like fish are also caught.

Commercial fishing on Lake Mweru and the Luapula River was pioneered by Greek fishermen from the Dodecanese islands who settled in Kasenga, DR Congo, on the western bank of the Luapula upriver from the lake in the first half of the 19th Century. They used boats built in Greek style powered by charcoal-fuelled steam engines, later replaced with diesel. They supplied the workforce of the copper mines in Lubumbashi (later the whole Copperbelt) with fish which was packed in ice at Kasenga and transported from there in trucks. It was estimated in 1950 there were 50 Greek boats catching of fresh fish per year. It would take a week for a boat to do the round trip to the lake and fill its hold, lined with ice carried on board.

In recent decades the catch has declined due to over-fishing and is estimated at tonnes caught from 4,500 small craft, mainly plank boats. Congolese fishermen catch the most despite having a slightly smaller share of the waters. The Tilapia are caught by gill nets, and do not reach the size they once did. Since the 1980s, &#x27;chisense&#x27; fishing increased. This method is used to catch small pelagic fish called kapenta, originally from beaches but now using lights on boats at night to attract the fish which are then scooped up in fine nets.

===Mining===

The Dikulushi Copper Mine is an open-cast mine north of Kilwa in DR Congo by dirt road, and west of the lake. 
The mine was sold by Anvil Mining to Mawson West, an Australian company, in March 2010.
When the mine is operating, heavy trucks carrying concentrate cross Mweru on a large motorised pontoon ferry from Kilwa to Nchelenge, a distance of , then drive to a copper smelter in Tsumeb, Namibia.

===Tourism===

Lake Mweru is undeveloped for tourism despite being regarded as &quot;truly beautiful&quot;. Lack of access in the past, a lack of wildlife conservation, and wars in DR Congo between 1996 and 2003 have not helped. 60 years ago the western and northern shores of the lake were home to large herds of elephant, the Luapula floodplain supported herds of lechwe, and the Lusenga Plain National Park and Mweru Wantipa National Park were noted for Cape buffalo, a great variety of antelope and lion. Most animal populations have been reduced by hunting, loss of habitat, and poaching. On the Zambian side perhaps only Mweru Wantipa National Park has tourism potential. On the Congolese side the Parc National de Kundelungu in the mountains south-west of the lake may be in better condition.

<text>ITER (initially the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, &quot;iter&quot; meaning &quot;the way&quot; or &quot;the path&quot; in Latin) is an international nuclear fusion research and engineering megaproject aimed at creating energy through a fusion process similar to that of the Sun. It is being built next to the Cadarache facility in southern France. Upon completion of construction of the main reactor and first plasma, planned for 2033–2034, ITER will be the largest of more than 100 fusion reactors built since the 1950s, with six times the plasma volume of JT-60SA in Japan, the largest tokamak operating today.

The long-term goal of fusion research is to generate electricity. ITER&#x27;s stated purpose is scientific research, and technological demonstration of a large fusion reactor, without electricity generation. ITER&#x27;s goals are to achieve enough fusion to produce 10 times as much thermal output power as thermal power absorbed by the plasma for short time periods; to demonstrate and test technologies that would be needed to operate a fusion power plant including cryogenics, heating, control and diagnostics systems, and remote maintenance; to achieve and learn from a &quot;burning&quot; plasma; to test tritium breeding; and to demonstrate the safety of a fusion plant.

ITER&#x27;s thermonuclear fusion reactor will use over 300 MW of electrical power to cause the plasma to absorb 50 MW of thermal power, creating 500 MW of heat from fusion for periods of 400 to 600 seconds. This would mean a ten-fold gain of plasma heating power (&quot;Q&quot;), as measured by heating input to thermal output, or &quot;Q&quot; ≥ 10. , the record for energy production using nuclear fusion is held by the National Ignition Facility reactor, which achieved a &quot;Q&quot; of 1.5 in December 2022. Beyond just heating the plasma, the total electricity consumed by the reactor and facilities will range from 110 MW up to 620 MW peak for 30-second periods during plasma operation. As a research reactor, the heat energy generated will not be converted to electricity, but simply vented.

ITER is funded and run by seven member parties: China, the European Union, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States. In the immediate aftermath of Brexit, the United Kingdom continued to participate in ITER through the EU&#x27;s Fusion for Energy (F4E) program; however, in September 2023, the UK decided to discontinue its participation in ITER via F4E, and by March 2024 had rejected an invitation to join ITER directly, deciding instead to pursue its own independent fusion research program. Switzerland participated through Euratom and F4E, but the EU effectively suspended Switzerland&#x27;s participation in response to the May 2021 collapse in talks on an EU-Swiss framework agreement; , Switzerland is considered a non-participant pending resolution of its dispute with the EU. The project also has cooperation agreements with Australia, Canada, Kazakhstan and Thailand.

Construction of the ITER complex in France started in 2013, and assembly of the tokamak began in 2020. The initial budget was close to €6 billion, but the total price of construction and operations is projected to be from €18 to €22 billion; other estimates place the total cost between $45 billion and $65 billion, though these figures are disputed by ITER. Regardless of the final cost, ITER has already been described as the most expensive science experiment of all time, the most complicated engineering project in human history, and one of the most ambitious human collaborations since the development of the International Space Station (€100 billion or $150 billion budget) and the Large Hadron Collider (€7.5 billion budget).

ITER&#x27;s planned successor, the EUROfusion-led DEMO, is expected to be one of the first fusion reactors to produce electricity in an experimental environment.

== Background ==

Fusion aims to replicate the process that takes place in stars where the intense heat at the core fuses together nuclei and produces large amounts of energy in the form of heat and light. Harnessing fusion power in terrestrial conditions would provide sufficient energy to satisfy mounting demand, and to do so in a sustainable manner that has a relatively small impact on the environment. One gram of deuterium-tritium fuel mixture in the process of nuclear fusion produces 90,000-kilowatt hours of energy, or the equivalent of 11 tonnes of coal.

Nuclear fusion uses a different approach from traditional nuclear energy. Current nuclear power stations rely on nuclear fission with the nucleus of an atom being split to release energy. Nuclear fusion takes multiple nuclei and uses intense heat to fuse them together, a process that also releases energy.

Nuclear fusion has many potential attractions. The fuel is relatively abundant or can be produced in a fusion reactor. After preliminary tests with deuterium, ITER will use a mix of deuterium-tritium for its fusion because of the combination&#x27;s high energy potential and because this fusion reaction is the easiest to run. The first isotope, deuterium, can be extracted from seawater, from which it is a nearly inexhaustible resource. The second isotope, tritium, only occurs in trace amounts in nature and the estimated world&#x27;s supply (mainly produced by the heavy-water CANDU fission reactors) is just 20 kilograms per year, insufficient for power plants. ITER will be testing tritium breeding blanket technology that would allow a future fusion reactor to create its own tritium and thus be self-sufficient. Furthermore, a fusion reactor would produce virtually no CO2 emissions or atmospheric pollutants, there would be no chance of a meltdown, and its radioactive waste products would mostly be very short-lived compared to those produced by conventional nuclear reactors (fission reactors).

On 21 November 2006, the seven project partners formally agreed to fund the creation of a nuclear fusion reactor. The program is anticipated to last for 30 years – 10 years for construction, and 20 years of operation. ITER was originally expected to cost approximately €5 billion. However, delays, the rising price of raw materials, and changes to the initial design have seen the official budget estimate rise to between €18 billion and €20 billion.

The reactor was expected to take 10 years to build, and ITER had planned to test its first plasma in 2020 and achieve full fusion by 2023. In 2024, ITER published a new schedule with deuterium-deuterium plasma operations starting in 2035. Site preparation has begun near Cadarache center, France, and French President Emmanuel Macron launched the assembly phase of the project at a ceremony in 2020. Under the revised schedule, work to achieve the first hydrogen plasma discharge was 70% complete in the middle of 2020 and considered to be on track.

One of the ITER objectives is a Q-value (&quot;fusion gain&quot;) of 10. Q = 1 is called &quot;breakeven&quot;. The best result achieved in a tokamak is 0.67 in the JET tokamak. The best result achieved for fusion in general is Q = 1.5, achieved in an inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiment by the National Ignition Facility in late 2022.

For commercial fusion power stations, engineering gain factor is important. Engineering gain factor is defined as the ratio of a plant electrical power output to electrical power input of all plant&#x27;s internal systems (tokamak external heating systems, electromagnets, cryogenics plant, diagnostics and control systems, etc.). Commercial fusion plants will be designed with engineering breakeven in mind (see DEMO). Some nuclear engineers consider a Q of 100 to be required for commercial fusion power stations to be viable.

ITER will not produce electricity. Producing electricity from thermal sources is a well known process (used in many power stations) and ITER will not run with significant fusion power output continuously. Adding electricity production to ITER would raise the cost of the project and bring no value for experiments on the tokamak. The DEMO-class reactors that are planned to follow ITER are intended to demonstrate the net production of electricity.

One of the primary ITER objectives is to achieve a state of &quot;burning plasma&quot;. Burning plasma is the state of the plasma when more than 50% of the energy received for plasma heating is received from fusion reactions (not from external sources). No fusion reactors had created a burning plasma until the competing NIF fusion project reached the milestone on 8 August 2021 using inertial confinement. At higher Q values, progressively bigger parts of plasma heating power will be produced by fusion reactions. This reduces the power needed from external heating systems at high Q values. The bigger a tokamak is, the more fusion-reaction-produced energy is preserved for internal plasma heating (and the less external heating is required), which also improves its Q-value. This is how ITER plans for its tokamak reactor to scale.

== Organisation history ==
The initial international cooperation for a nuclear fusion project that was the foundation of ITER began in 1978 with the International Tokamak Reactor, or INTOR, which had four partners: the Soviet Union, the European Atomic Energy Community, the United States, and Japan. However, the INTOR project stalled until Mikhail Gorbachev became general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in March 1985. Gorbachev first revived interest in a collaborative fusion project in an October 1985 meeting with French President François Mitterrand, and then the idea was further developed in November 1985 at the Geneva Summit with Ronald Reagan.

Preparations for the Gorbachev-Reagan summit showed that there were no tangible agreements in the works for the summit. However, the ITER project was gaining momentum in political circles due to the quiet work being done by two physicists, the American scientist Alvin Trivelpiece who served as Director of the Office of Energy Research in the 1980s and the Russian scientist Evgeny Velikhov who would become head of the Kurchatov Institute for nuclear research. The two scientists both supported a project to construct a demonstration fusion reactor. At the time, magnetic fusion research was ongoing in Japan, Europe, the Soviet Union and the US, but Trivelpiece and Velikhov believed that taking the next step in fusion research would be beyond the budget of any of the key nations and that collaboration would be useful internationally.

Dr. Michael Robert, who is the director of International Programs of the Office of Fusion Energy at the US Department of Energy, explains that, &#x27;In September 1985, I led a US science team to Moscow as part of our bilateral fusion activities. Velikhov proposed to me at lunch one day his idea of having the USSR and USA work together to proceed to a fusion reactor. My response was &#x27;great idea&#x27;, but from my position, I have no capability of pushing that idea upward to the President.&#x27; 

This push for cooperation on nuclear fusion is cited as a key moment of science diplomacy, but nonetheless a major bureaucratic fight erupted in the US government over the project. One argument against collaboration was that the Soviets would use it to steal US technology and expertise. A second was symbolic and involved American criticism of how the Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov was being treated. Sakharov was an early proponent of the peaceful use of nuclear technology and along with Igor Tamm he developed the idea for the tokamak that is at the heart of nuclear fusion research. However, Sakharov also supported broader civil liberties in the Soviet Union, and his activism earned him both the 1975 Nobel peace prize and internal exile in Russia, which he opposed by going on multiple hunger strikes. The United States National Security Council convened a meeting under the direction of William Flynn Martin to discuss the nuclear fusion project that resulted in a consensus that the US should go forward with the project.

This led to nuclear fusion cooperation being discussed at the Geneva summit and release of a historic joint statement from Reagan and Gorbachev that emphasized, &quot;the potential importance of the work aimed at utilizing controlled thermonuclear fusion for peaceful purposes and, in this connection, advocated the widest practicable development of international cooperation in obtaining this source of energy, which is essentially inexhaustible, for the benefit of all mankind.&quot; For the fusion community, this statement was a breakthrough, and it was reinforced when Reagan evoked the possibilities of nuclear fusion in a Joint Session of Congress later in the month.

As a result, collaboration on an international fusion experiment began to move forward. In October 1986 at the Reykjavik Summit, the so-called &#x27;Quadripartite Initiative Committee&#x27; (Europe through the Euratom countries, Japan, USSR, and the US) was formed to oversee the development of the project. The year after, in March 1987, the Quadripartite Initiative Committee met at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) headquarters in Vienna. This meeting marked the launch of the conceptual design studies for the experimental reactors as well as the start of negotiations for operational issues such as the legal foundations for the peaceful use of fusion technology, the organizational structure and staffing, and the eventual location for the project. This meeting in Vienna was also where the project was baptized the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, though it was quickly called by its abbreviation alone and its Latin meaning of &#x27;the way&#x27;.

Conceptual and engineering design phases were carried out under the auspices of the IAEA. The original technical objectives were established in 1992 and the original Engineering Design Activities (EDA) were completed in 1998. An acceptable, detailed design was validated in July 2001 to complete the extended EDA period, and the validated design then went through a Design Review that began November 2006 and concluded in December 2007. The design process was difficult with arguments over issues such as whether there should be circular cross sections for magnetic confinement or D-shaped cross sections. These issues were partly responsible for the United States temporarily exiting the project in 1998 before rejoining in 2003.

At this same time, the group of ITER partners was expanding; China and South Korea joined the project in 2003 and India formally joined in 2005.

There was a heated competition to host the ITER project with the candidates narrowed down to two possible sites: France and Japan. Russia, China, and the European Union supported the choice of Cadarache in France, while the United States, South Korea, and Japan support the choice of Rokkasho in Japan. In June 2005, it was officially announced that ITER would be built in the South of France at the Cadarache site. The negotiations that led to the decision ended in a compromise between the EU and Japan, in that Japan was promised 20% of the research staff on the French location of ITER, as well as the head of the administrative body of ITER. In addition, it was agreed that 8% of the ITER construction budget would go to partner facilities that would be built in Japan.

On 21 November 2006, at a ceremony hosted by French President Jacques Chirac at the Élysée Palace in Paris, an international consortium signed a formal agreement to build the reactor. Initial work to clear the site for construction began in Cadarache in March 2007 and, once this agreement was ratified by all partners, the ITER Organization was officially established on 24 October 2007.

In 2016, Australia became the first non-member partner of the project. ITER signed a technical cooperation agreement with the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), granting this country access to research results of ITER in exchange for the construction of selected parts of the ITER machine. In 2017, Kazakhstan signed a cooperation agreement that laid the groundwork for technical collaboration between the National Nuclear Center of the Republic of Kazakhstan and ITER. Most recently, after collaborating with ITER in the early stages of the project, Canada signed a cooperation agreement in 2020 with a focus on tritium and tritium-related equipment.

The project began its assembly phase in July 2020, launched by French President Emmanuel Macron in the presence of other members of the ITER project.

== Directors-General ==

ITER is supervised by a governing body known as the ITER Council that is composed of representatives of the seven signatories to the ITER Agreement. The ITER Council is responsible for the overall direction of the organization and decides such issues as the budget.
The ITER Council also appoints the director-general of the project. There have been five directors-general so far:
* 2005–2010: Kaname Ikeda
* 2010–2015: Osamu Motojima
* 2015–2022: Bernard Bigot
* 2022: Eisuke Tada (acting)
* 2022–present: Pietro Barabaschi
Bernard Bigot was appointed to reform the management and governance of the ITER project in 2015. In January 2019, the ITER Council voted unanimously to reappoint Bigot for a second five-year term. Bigot died on May 14, 2022, and his deputy Eisuke Tada took over leadership of ITER during the search process for the new director.

== Objectives ==

ITER&#x27;s stated mission is to demonstrate the feasibility of fusion power as a large-scale, carbon-free source of energy.
More specifically, the project has aims to:
* Momentarily produce a fusion plasma with thermal power ten times greater than the injected thermal power (a &quot;Q&quot; value of 10).
* Produce a steady-state plasma with a &quot;Q&quot; value greater than 5. (&quot;Q&quot; = 1 is scientific breakeven, as defined in fusion energy gain factor.)
* Maintain a fusion pulse for up to 8 minutes.
* Develop technologies and processes needed for a fusion power station — including superconducting magnets and remote handling (maintenance by robot).
* Verify tritium breeding concepts.
* Refine neutron shield / heat conversion technology (most of the energy in the D+T fusion reaction is released in the form of fast neutrons).
* Experiment with burning plasma state.
The objectives of the ITER project are not limited to creating the nuclear fusion device but are much broader, including building necessary technical, organizational, and logistical capabilities, skills, tools, supply chains, and culture enabling management of such megaprojects among participating countries, bootstrapping their local nuclear fusion industries.

== Timeline and status ==


 ITER is near 85% complete toward first plasma. First plasma was scheduled for late 2025, however delays were acknowledged in 2023 which would impact this target. In July 2024, ITER announced a new schedule which included full plasma current in 2034, the start of operations with a deuterium-deuterium plasma in 2035, and deuterium-tritium operations in 2039.

The start of the project can be traced back to 1978 when the European Commission, Japan, United States, and USSR joined for the International Tokamak Reactor (INTOR) Workshop. This initiative was held under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency and its goals were to assess the readiness of magnetic fusion to move forward to the experimental power reactor (EPR) stage, to identify the additional R&amp;D that must be undertaken, and to define the characteristics of such an EPR by means of a conceptual design. From 1978 to the middle of the 1980s, hundreds of fusion scientists and engineers in each participating country took part in a detailed assessment of the tokamak confinement system and the design possibilities for harnessing nuclear fusion energy.

In 1985, at the Geneva summit meeting in 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev suggested to Ronald Reagan that the two countries jointly undertake the construction of a tokamak EPR as proposed by the INTOR Workshop. The ITER project was initiated in 1988.

Ground was broken in 2007 and construction of the ITER tokamak complex started in 2013.

Machine assembly was launched on 28 July 2020. The construction of the facility was expected to be completed in 2025 when commissioning of the reactor can commence and initial plasma experiments were scheduled to begin at the end of that year. When ITER becomes operational, it will be the largest magnetic confinement plasma physics experiment in use with a plasma volume of 840 cubic meters, surpassing the Joint European Torus by a factor of 8.

On 3 July 2024, ITER director-general Pietro Barabaschi announced the first plasma production in the project will not take place until, at least, 2033. The energy from magnets will be produced no earlier than 2036, rather than 2033, as previously planned in 2016. He additionally said the cost of repairing some malfunctioning pieces was estimated at €5 billion.

== Reactor overview ==
When deuterium and tritium fuse, two nuclei come together to form a helium nucleus (an alpha particle), and a high-energy neutron.
:H + H → He + + 
While nearly all stable isotopes lighter on the periodic table than iron-56 and nickel-62, which have the highest binding energy per nucleon, will fuse with some other isotope and release energy, deuterium and tritium are by far the most attractive for energy generation as they require the lowest activation energy (thus lowest temperature) to do so, while producing among the most energy per unit weight.

All proto- and mid-life stars radiate enormous amounts of energy generated by fusion processes. Deuterium–tritium fusion releases, per mass, roughly three times as much energy as uranium-235 fission, and millions of times more energy than a chemical reaction such as the burning of coal. It is the goal of a fusion power station to harness this energy to produce electricity.

Activation energies (in most fusion systems this is the temperature required to initiate the reaction) for fusion are generally high because the protons in each nucleus strongly repel one another, as they each have the same positive charge. A heuristic for estimating reaction rates is that nuclei must be able to get within 100 femtometers (10 meter) of each other, where the nuclei are increasingly likely to undergo quantum tunneling past the electrostatic barrier and the turning point where the strong nuclear force and the electrostatic force are equally balanced, allowing them to fuse. In ITER, this distance of approach is made possible by high temperatures and magnetic confinement. ITER uses cooling equipment like a cryopump to cool the magnets to near absolute zero. High temperatures give the nuclei enough energy to overcome their electrostatic repulsion (see Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution). For deuterium and tritium, the optimal reaction rates occur at temperatures higher than 10 kelvin. At ITER, the plasma will be heated to 150 million kelvin (about ten times the temperature at the core of the Sun) by ohmic heating (running a current through the plasma). Additional heating is applied using neutral beam injection (which cross magnetic field lines without a net deflection and will not cause a large electromagnetic disruption) and radio frequency (RF) or microwave heating.

At such high temperatures, particles have a large kinetic energy, and hence speed. If unconfined, the particles will rapidly escape, taking the energy with them, cooling the plasma to the point where net energy is no longer produced. A successful reactor would need to contain the particles in a small enough volume for a long enough time for much of the plasma to fuse.
In ITER and many other magnetic confinement reactors, the plasma, a gas of charged particles, is confined using magnetic fields. A charged particle moving through a magnetic field experiences a force perpendicular to the direction of travel, resulting in centripetal acceleration, thereby confining it to move in a circle or helix around the lines of magnetic flux. ITER will use four types of magnets to contain the plasma: a central solenoid magnet, poloidal magnets around the edges of the tokamak, 18 D-shaped toroidal-field coils, and correction coils.

A solid confinement vessel is also needed, both to shield the magnets and other equipment from high temperatures and energetic photons and particles, and to maintain a near-vacuum for the plasma to populate. The containment vessel is subjected to a barrage of very energetic particles, where electrons, ions, photons, alpha particles, and neutrons constantly bombard it and degrade the structure. The material must be designed to endure this environment so that a power station would be economical. Tests of such materials will be carried out both at ITER and at IFMIF (International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility).

Once fusion has begun, high-energy neutrons will radiate from the reactive regions of the plasma, crossing magnetic field lines easily due to charge neutrality (see neutron flux). Since it is the neutrons that receive the majority of the energy, they will be ITER&#x27;s primary source of energy output. Ideally, alpha particles will expend their energy in the plasma, further heating it.

The inner wall of the containment vessel will have 440 blanket modules that are designed to slow and absorb neutrons in a reliable and efficient manner and therefore protect the steel structure and the superconducting toroidal field magnets. At later stages of the ITER project, experimental blanket modules will be used to test breeding tritium for fuel from lithium-bearing ceramic pebbles contained within the blanket module following the following reactions:
: + → + + 
where the reactant neutron is supplied by the D-T fusion reaction.

Energy absorbed from the fast neutrons is extracted and passed into the primary coolant. This heat energy would then be used to power an electricity-generating turbine in a real power station; in ITER this electricity generating system is not of scientific interest, so instead the heat will be extracted and disposed of.

== Technical design ==
=== Vacuum vessel ===

The vacuum vessel is the central part of the ITER machine: a double-walled steel container in which the plasma is contained by means of magnetic fields.

The ITER vacuum vessel will be twice as large and 16 times as heavy as any previously manufactured fusion vessel: each of the nine torus-shaped sectors will weigh approximately 450 tonnes. When all the shielding and port structures are included, this adds up to a total of 5,116 tonnes. Its external diameter will measure , the internal . Once assembled, the whole structure will be high.

The primary function of the vacuum vessel is to provide a hermetically sealed plasma container. Its main components are the main vessel, the port structures and the supporting system. The main vessel is a double-walled structure with poloidal and toroidal stiffening ribs between shells to reinforce the vessel structure. These ribs also form the flow passages for the cooling water. The space between the double walls will be filled with shield structures made of stainless steel. The inner surfaces of the vessel will act as the interface with breeder modules containing the breeder blanket component. These modules will provide shielding from the high-energy neutrons produced by the fusion reactions and some will also be used for tritium breeding concepts.

The vacuum vessel has a total of 44 openings that are known as ports – 18 upper, 17 equatorial, and 9 lower ports – that will be used for remote handling operations, diagnostic systems, neutral beam injections and vacuum pumping. Remote handling is made necessary by the radioactive interior of the reactor following a shutdown, which is caused by neutron bombardment during operation.

Vacuum pumping will be done before the start of fusion reactions to create the necessary low density environment, which is about one million times lower than the density of air.

=== Breeder blanket ===
ITER will use deuterium-tritium fuel. While deuterium is abundant in nature, tritium is much rarer because it is radioactive with a half-life of just 12.3 years and there are only about 3.5 kg of natural tritium on earth. Owing to this tiny supply of tritium, an important component for testing on ITER is the breeding blanket. This component, located in the ports of the vacuum vessel, serves to test the production of tritium by reaction with neutrons from the plasma. There are several reactions that produce tritium within the blanket. Lithium-6 produces tritium via (n,t) reactions with moderated neutrons, while Lithium-7 produces tritium via interactions with higher energy neutrons via (n,nt) reactions.

Concepts for the breeder blanket include helium-cooled lithium lead (HCLL), helium-cooled pebble bed (HCPB), and water-cooled lithium lead (WCLL) methods. Six different tritium breeding blanket mock-ups, known as Test Blanket Modules (TBM), will be tested in ITER and will share a common box geometry. Materials for use as breeder pebbles in the HCPB concept include lithium metatitanate and lithium orthosilicate. Requirements of breeder materials include good tritium production and extraction, mechanical stability and low levels of radioactive activation.

=== Magnet system ===
ITER is based on magnetic confinement fusion that uses magnetic fields to contain the fusion fuel in plasma form. The magnet system used in the ITER tokamak will be the largest superconducting magnet system ever built. The system will use four types of magnets to achieve plasma confinement: a central solenoid magnet, poloidal magnets, toroidal-field coils, and correction coils. The central solenoid coil will be 18 meters tall, 4.3 m wide, and weigh 1000 tonnes. It will use superconducting niobium–tin to carry 45 kA and produce a peak field of more than 13 teslas.

The 18 toroidal field coils will also use niobium-tin. They are the most powerful superconductive magnets ever designed with a nominal peak field strength of 11.8 teslas and a stored magnetic energy of 41 gigajoules. Other lower field ITER magnets (poloidal field and correction coils) will use niobium–titanium for their superconducting elements.

=== Additional heating ===
To achieve fusion, plasma particles must be heated to temperatures that reach as high as 150 million °C. To achieve these extreme temperatures, multiple heating methods must be used. Within the tokamak itself, changing magnetic fields produce a heating effect but external heating is also required. There will be three types of external heating in ITER:

* Two one-million volt heating neutral beam injectors (HNB) that will each provide about 16.5MW to the burning plasma, with the possibility to add a third injector. The beams generate electrically charged deuterium ions that are accelerated through five grids to reach the required energy of 1MV and the beams can operate for the entire plasma pulse duration, a total of up to 3600 seconds. The prototype is being built at the Neutral Beam Test Facility (NBTF), which was constructed in Padua, Italy. There is also a smaller neutral beam that will be used for diagnostics to help detect the amount of helium ash inside the tokamak.
* An ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) system that will inject 20 MW of electromagnetic power into the plasma by using antennas to generate radio waves that have the same rate of oscillation as the ions in the plasma.
* An electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) system that will heat electrons in the plasma using a high-intensity beam of electromagnetic radiation.

=== Cryostat ===
The ITER cryostat is a large 3,850-tonne stainless steel structure surrounding the vacuum vessel and the superconducting magnets, with the purpose of providing a super-cool vacuum environment. Its thickness (ranging from ) will allow it to withstand the stresses induced by atmospheric pressure acting on the enclosed volume of 8,500 cubic meters. On 9 June 2020, Larsen &amp; Toubro completed the delivery and installation of the cryostat module. The cryostat is the major component of the tokamak complex, which sits on a seismically isolated base.

=== Divertor ===

The divertor is a device within the tokamak that allows for removal of waste and impurities from the plasma while the reactor is operating. At ITER, the divertor will extract heat and ash that are created by the fusion process, while also protecting the surrounding walls and reducing plasma contamination.

The ITER divertor, which has been compared to a massive ashtray, is primarily composed of tungsten. The divertor targets, which are the components directly exposed to the plasma, are made of tungsten due to its high melting point, low sputtering yield, and low tritium retention. The underlying structure of the divertor includes materials like copper alloy for heat conduction and stainless steel for structural support.

The divertor consists of 54 cassettes. Each cassette weighs roughly eight tonnes and measures 0.8 meters x 2.3 meters by 3.5 meters. The divertor design and construction is being overseen by the Fusion For Energy agency.

When the ITER tokamak is in operation, the plasma-facing units endure heat spikes as high as 20 megawatts per square metre, which is more than four times higher than what is experienced by a spacecraft entering Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

The testing of the divertor is being done at the ITER Divertor Test Facility (IDTF) in Russia. This facility was created at the Efremov Institute in Saint Petersburg as part of the ITER Procurement Arrangement that spreads design and manufacturing across the project&#x27;s member countries.

=== Cooling systems ===
The ITER tokamak will use interconnected cooling systems to manage the heat generated during operation. Most of the heat will be removed by a primary water cooling loop, itself cooled by water from a secondary loop through a heat exchanger within the tokamak building&#x27;s secondary confinement. The secondary cooling loop will be cooled by a larger complex, comprising a cooling tower, a pipeline supplying water from the Canal de Provence, and basins that allow cooling water to be cooled and tested for chemical contamination and tritium before being released into the river Durance. This system will need to dissipate an average power of during the tokamak&#x27;s operation. A liquid nitrogen system will provide a further of cooling to , and a liquid helium system will provide of cooling to . The liquid helium system will be designed, manufactured, installed and commissioned by Air Liquide in France.

== Location ==
The process of selecting a location for ITER was long and drawn out. Japan proposed a site in Rokkasho. Two European sites were considered, the Cadarache site in France and the Vandellòs site in Spain, but the European Competitiveness Council named Cadarache as its official candidate in November 2003. Additionally, Canada announced a bid for the site in Clarington in May 2001, but withdrew from the race in 2003.

From this point on, the choice was between France and Japan. On 3 May 2005, the EU and Japan agreed to a process which would settle their dispute by July. At the final meeting in Moscow on 28 June 2005, the participating parties agreed to construct ITER at Cadarache with Japan receiving a privileged partnership that included a Japanese director-general for the project and a financial package to construct facilities in Japan.
Fusion for Energy, the EU agency in charge of the European contribution to the project, is located in Barcelona, Spain. Fusion for Energy (F4E) is the European Union&#x27;s Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy. According to the agency&#x27;s website: F4E is responsible for providing Europe&#x27;s contribution to ITER, the world&#x27;s largest scientific partnership that aims to demonstrate fusion as a viable and sustainable source of energy. [...] F4E also supports fusion research and development initiatives [...]
The ITER Neutral Beam Test Facility aimed at developing and optimizing the neutral beam injector prototype, is being constructed in Padova, Italy. It will be the only ITER facility out of the site in Cadarache.

Most of the buildings at ITER will or have been clad in an alternating pattern of reflective stainless steel and grey lacquered metal. This was done for aesthetic reasons to blend the buildings with their surrounding environment and to aid with thermal insulation.

== Participants ==
Currently there are seven signatories to the ITER Agreement: China, the European Union, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States.

As a consequence of Brexit, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from Euratom on 31 January 2020. However, under the terms of the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the United Kingdom initially remained a member of ITER as a part of Fusion for Energy following the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020. However, in 2023, the United Kingdom decided to discontinue its participation in Fusion for Energy, and in 2024 decided not to seek membership in ITER independently of the EU, leaving the UK no longer a participant in the ITER project.

In March 2009, Switzerland, an associate member of Euratom since 1979, also ratified the country&#x27;s accession to the Fusion for Energy as a third country member.

In 2016, ITER announced a partnership with Australia for &quot;technical cooperation in areas of mutual benefit and interest&quot;, but without Australia becoming a full member.

In 2017, ITER signed a Cooperation Agreement with Kazakhstan.

Thailand also has an official role in the project after a cooperation agreement was signed between the ITER Organization and the Thailand Institute of Nuclear Technology in 2018. The agreement provides courses and lectures to students and scientists in Thailand and facilitates relationships between Thailand and the ITER project.

Canada was previously a full member but pulled out due to a lack of funding from the federal government. The lack of funding also resulted in Canada&#x27;s withdrawing from its bid for the ITER site in 2003. Canada rejoined the project in 2020 via a cooperation agreement that focused on tritium and tritium-related equipment.

ITER&#x27;s work is supervised by the ITER Council, which has the authority to appoint senior staff, amend regulations, decide on budgeting issues, and allow additional states or organizations to participate in ITER. The current Chairman of the ITER Council is Won Namkung, and the acting ITER Director-General is Eisuke Tada.

== Domestic agencies ==

Each member of the ITER project – The European Union, China, India, Japan, Korea, Russia, and the United States – has created a domestic agency to meet its contributions and procurement responsibilities. These agencies employ their own staff, have their own budget, and directly oversee all industrial contracts and subcontracting.

=== ITER EU ===

The ITER Agreement was signed by Euratom representing the EU. Fusion for Energy, often referred to as F4E, was created in 2007 as the EU&#x27;s domestic agency, with headquarters in Barcelona, Spain, and further offices in Cadarache, France, Garching, Germany, and Rokkasho, Japan. F4E is responsible for contributing to the design and manufacture of components such as the vacuum vessel, the divertor, and the magnets.

=== ITER China ===

China&#x27;s contribution to ITER is managed through the China International Nuclear Fusion Energy Program or the CNDA. The Chinese agency is working on components such as the correction coil, magnet supports, the first wall, and shield blanket. China is also running experiments on their HL-2M tokamak in Chengdu and HT-7U (EAST) in Hefei to help support ITER research.

=== ITER India ===

ITER-India is a special project run by India&#x27;s Institute for Plasma Research. ITER-India&#x27;s research facility is based in Ahmedabad in the Gujarat state. India&#x27;s deliverables to the ITER project include the cryostat, cryolines, in-vessel shielding, cooling and cooling water systems.

=== ITER Japan ===

Japan&#x27;s National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Sciences and Technology, or QST, is now the designated Japanese domestic agency for the ITER project. The organization is based in Chiba, Japan. Japan collaborates with the ITER Organization and ITER members to help design and produce components for the tokamak, including the blanket remote handling system, the central solenoid coils, the plasma diagnostics systems, and the neutral beam injection heating systems.

=== ITER Korea ===

ITER Korea was established in 2007 under Korea&#x27;s National Fusion Research Institute and the organization is based in Daejeon, South Korea. Among the procurement items that ITER Korea is responsible for four sectors of the vacuum vessel, the blanket shield block, thermal shields, and the tritium storage and delivery system.

=== ITER Russia ===

Russia occupies one of the key positions in the implementation of the international ITER Project. The Russian Federation&#x27;s contribution to the ITER project lies in the manufacture and supply of high-tech equipment and basic reactor systems. The Russian Federation&#x27;s contribution is being made under the aegis of Rosatom or the State Atomic Energy Corporation. The Russian Federation has multiple obligations to the ITER project, including the supply of 22 kilometers of conductors based on 90 tonnes of superconducting Nb3Sn strands for winding coils of a toroidal field and 11 km of conductors based on 40 tonnes of superconducting NbTi strands for windings of coils of a poloidal field of the ITER magnetic system, sent in late 2022. Russia is responsible for the manufacture of 179 of the most energy-intensive (up to 5 MW/sq.m) panels of the First Wall. The panels are covered with beryllium plates soldered to CuCrZr bronze, which is connected to a steel base. Panel size up to 2 m wide, 1.4 m high; its mass is about 1000 kg. The obligation of the Russian Federation also includes conducting thermal tests of ITER components that are facing the plasma. Today, Russia, thanks to its participation in the project, has the full design documentation for the ITER reactor.

=== ITER US ===

US ITER is part of the US Department of Energy and is managed by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. US ITER is responsible for both the design and manufacturing of components for the ITER project, and American involvement includes contributions to the tokamak cooling system, the diagnostics systems, the electron and ion cyclotron heating transmission lines, the toroidal and central solenoid magnet systems, and the pellet injection systems. 
In 2022, the US fusion research community released its plan for a US ITER Research Program covering key research areas such as plasma-material interactions, plasma diagnostics, and fusion nuclear science and technology. The plan envisions close collaboration between the US and other ITER partners to ensure the successful operation of ITER.

== Funding ==

In 2006, the ITER Agreement was signed on the basis of an estimated cost of €5.9 billion over a ten-year period. In 2008, as a result of a design review, the estimate was revised upwards to about €19 billion. As of 2016, the total cost of constructing and operating the experiment is expected to be over €22 billion, an increase of €4.6 billion of its 2010 estimate, and of €9.6 billion from the 2009 estimate.

At the June 2005 conference in Moscow the participating members of the ITER cooperation agreed on the following division of funding contributions for the construction phase: 45.4% by the hosting member, the European Union, and the rest split between the non-hosting members at a rate of 9.1% each for China, India, Japan, South Korea, the Russian Federation and the US. During the operation and deactivation phases, Euratom will contribute to 34% of the total costs; Japan and the United States 13%; and China, India, Korea, and Russia 10%.

90% of contributions will be delivered &#x27;in-kind&#x27; using ITER&#x27;s own currency, the ITER Units of Account (IUAs). Though Japan&#x27;s financial contribution as a non-hosting member is one-eleventh of the total, the EU agreed to grant it a special status so that Japan will provide for two-elevenths of the research staff at Cadarache and be awarded two-elevenths of the construction contracts, while the European Union&#x27;s staff and construction components contributions will be cut from five-elevenths to four-elevenths.

The American contribution to ITER has been the subject to debate. The US Department of Energy (USDOE) has estimated the total construction costs to 2025, including in-kind contributions, to be $65 billion, though ITER disputes this calculation. After having reduced funding to ITER in 2017, the United States ended up doubling its initial budget to $122 million in-kind contribution in 2018. It is estimated the total contribution to ITER for the year 2020 was $247 million, an amount that is part of the USDOE&#x27;s Fusion Energy Sciences program. Under a strategic plan to guide American fusion energy efforts that was approved in January 2021, the USDOE directed the Fusion Energy Sciences Advisory Committee to assume that the US will continue to fund ITER for a ten-year period.

Support for the European budget for ITER has also varied over the course of the project. It was reported in December 2010 that the European Parliament had refused to approve a plan by member states to reallocate €1.4 billion from the budget to cover a shortfall in ITER building costs in 2012–13. The closure of the 2010 budget required this financing plan to be revised, and the European Commission (EC) was forced to put forward an ITER budgetary resolution proposal in 2011. In the end, the European contribution to ITER for the 2014 to 2020 period was set at €2.9 billion. Most recently, in February 2021, the European Council approved ITER financing of €5.61 billion for the period of 2021 to 2027.

== Manufacturing ==

The construction of the ITER tokamak has been compared to the assembly of “a giant three-dimensional puzzle” because the parts are manufactured around the world and then shipped to France for assembly. This assembly system is the result of the ITER Agreement that stipulates that member contributions were to be mostly “in-kind” with countries manufacturing components instead of providing money. This system was devised to provide economic stimulus and fusion expertise in the countries funding the project and the general framework called for 90% of member contributions to be in material or components and 10% to be in money.

As a result, more than 2800 design or manufacturing contracts have been signed since the launch of the project. According to a 2017 estimate from French Minister for Research, Education and Innovation, Frédérique Vidal, there were 500 companies involved in the construction of ITER and Bernard Bigot stated that €7 billion in contracts had been awarded to prime contractors in Europe alone since 2007.

The overall assembly of the tokamak facility is being overseen through a €174-million contract awarded to Momentum, a joint venture between Amec Foster Wheeler (Britain), Assystem (France), and Kepco (South Korea). One of the largest tenders was a €530-million contract for HVAC systems and mechanical and electrical equipment that was awarded to a European consortium involving ENGIE (France) and Exyte (Germany). A tokamak assembly contract worth €200 million also went to a European consortium, Dynamic, that includes the companies Ansaldo Energia (Italy), ENGIE (France), and SIMIC (Italy). The French industrial conglomerate Daher was awarded more than €100 million in logistics contracts for ITER, which includes the shipment of the heavy components from the different manufacturers around the world.

In America, US ITER has awarded $1.3 billion in contracts to American companies since the beginning of the project and there is an estimated $800 million in future contracts still to come. The major US contracts include General Atomics being selected to design and manufacture the crucial central solenoid magnet.

In 2019, the Chinese consortium led by China Nuclear Power Engineering Corporation signed a contract for machine assembly at ITER that was the biggest nuclear energy contract ever signed by a Chinese company in Europe.

Russia is supplying magnet and vacuum-injection systems for ITER with construction being done at the Sredne-Nevsky Shipyard in Saint Petersburg.

In India, the contract for construction of the cryostat, one of the fundamental pieces of the tokamak, was awarded to Larsen &amp; Toubro, who also have ITER contracts for water cooling systems. InoxCVA, an Inox Group company will supply cryolines for the ITER Project.

Two of Japan&#x27;s industrial leaders, Toshiba Energy Systems &amp; Solutions and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, have contracts to manufacture the toroidal field coils for ITER. Construction of another key part of the tokamak, the vacuum vessel, was awarded to Hyundai Heavy Industries and is being built in Korea.

Delays were acknowledged in 2023, which would impact the target to create plasma by 2025; it was hoped the 2035 full-fusion target could be maintained. A new schedule was issued in July 2024, targeting first plasma in the mid-2030s and the start of deuterium-tritium operations by 2039.

== Criticism ==

The ITER project has been criticized for issues such as its possible environmental impacts, its usefulness as a response to climate change, the design of its tokamak, and how the experiment&#x27;s objectives have been expressed.

When France was announced as the site of the ITER project in 2005, several European environmentalists stated their opposition to the project. For example, the French politician Noël Mamère argued that the fight against global warming would be neglected as a result of ITER: “This is not good news for the fight against the greenhouse effect because we&#x27;re going to put ten billion euros towards a project that has a term of 30–50 years when we&#x27;re not even sure it will be effective.&quot; However, another French environmental association, Association des Ecologistes Pour le Nucléaire (AEPN), welcomed the ITER project as an important part of the response to climate change.

Within the broader fusion sector, a number of researchers working on non-tokamak systems, such as the independent fusion scientist Eric Lerner, have argued that other fusion projects would be a fraction of ITER&#x27;s cost and could be a potentially more viable and/or more cost-effective path to fusion power. Other critics, such as Daniel Jassby, accuse ITER researchers of being unwilling to face up to the technical and economic potential problems posed by tokamak fusion schemes.

In terms of the design of the tokamak, one concern arose from the 2013 tokamak parameters database interpolation that revealed the power load on a tokamak divertor would be five times the previously expected value. Given that the projected power load on the ITER divertor will already be very high, these new findings led to new design testing initiatives.

Another issue that critics raised regarding ITER and future deuterium-tritium (DT) fusion projects is the available supply of tritium. As it stands, ITER will use all existing supplies of tritium for its experiment and the current state-of-the-art technology isn&#x27;t sufficient to generate enough tritium to fulfill the needs of future DT fuel cycle experiments for fusion energy. According to the conclusion of a 2020 study that analyzed the tritium issue, “successful development of the DT fuel cycle for DEMO and future fusion reactors requires an intensive R&amp;D program in key areas of plasma physics and fusion technologies.”

=== Responses to criticism ===
Proponents believe that much of the ITER criticism is misleading and inaccurate, in particular the allegations of the experiment&#x27;s &quot;inherent danger&quot;. The stated goals for a commercial fusion power station design are that the amount of radioactive waste produced should be hundreds of times less than that of a fission reactor, and that it should produce no long-lived radioactive waste, and that it is impossible for any such reactor to undergo a large-scale runaway chain reaction. A direct contact of the plasma with ITER inner walls would contaminate it, causing it to cool immediately and stop the fusion process. In addition, the amount of fuel contained in a fusion reactor chamber (one half gram of deuterium/tritium fuel) is only sufficient to sustain the fusion burn pulse from minutes up to an hour at most, whereas a fission reactor usually contains several years&#x27; worth of fuel.
Moreover, some detritiation systems will be implemented, so that, at a fuel cycle inventory level of about , ITER will eventually need to recycle large amounts of tritium and at turnovers orders of magnitude higher than any preceding tritium facility worldwide.

In the case of an accident (or sabotage), it is expected that a fusion reactor would release far less radioactive pollution than would an ordinary fission nuclear station. Furthermore, ITER&#x27;s type of fusion power has little in common with nuclear weapons technology, and does not produce the fissile materials necessary for the construction of a weapon. Proponents note that large-scale fusion power would be able to produce reliable electricity on demand, and with virtually zero pollution (no gaseous CO2, SO2, or NOx by-products are produced).

According to researchers at a demonstration reactor in Japan, a fusion generator should be feasible in the 2030s and no later than the 2050s. Japan is pursuing its own research program with several operational facilities that are exploring several fusion paths.

In the United States alone, electricity accounts for US$210 billion in annual sales. Asia&#x27;s electricity sector attracted US$93 billion in private investment between 1990 and 1999. These figures take into account only current prices. Proponents of ITER contend that an investment in research now should be viewed as an attempt to earn a far greater future return and a 2017–18 study of the impact of ITER investments on the EU economy have concluded that &#x27;in the medium and long-term, there is likely to be a positive return on investment from the EU commitment to ITER.&#x27;
Also, worldwide investment of less than US$1 billion per year into ITER is not incompatible with concurrent research into other methods of power generation, which in 2007 totaled US$16.9 billion.

Supporters of ITER emphasize that the only way to test ideas for withstanding the intense neutron flux is to subject materials experimentally to that flux, which is one of the primary missions of ITER and the IFMIF, and both facilities will be vitally important to that effort. The purpose of ITER is to explore the scientific and engineering questions that surround potential fusion power stations. It is nearly impossible to acquire satisfactory data for the properties of materials expected to be subject to an intense neutron flux, and burning plasmas are expected to have quite different properties from externally heated plasmas. Supporters contend that the answer to these questions requires the ITER experiment, especially in the light of the monumental potential benefits.

Furthermore, the main line of research via tokamaks has been developed to the point that it is now possible to undertake the penultimate step in magnetic confinement plasma physics research with a self-sustained reaction. In the tokamak research program, recent advances devoted to controlling the configuration of the plasma have led to the achievement of substantially improved energy and pressure confinement, which reduces the projected cost of electricity from such reactors by a factor of two to a value only about 50% more than the projected cost of electricity from advanced light-water reactors. In addition, progress in the development of advanced, low activation structural materials supports the promise of environmentally benign fusion reactors and research into alternate confinement concepts is yielding the promise of future improvements in confinement. Finally, supporters contend that other potential replacements to the fossil fuels have environmental issues of their own. Solar, wind, and hydroelectric power all have very low surface power density compared to ITER&#x27;s successor DEMO which, at 2,000 MW, would have an energy density that exceeds even large fission power stations.

Safety of the project is regulated according to French and EU nuclear power regulations. In 2011, the French Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN) delivered a favorable opinion, and then, based on the French Act on Nuclear Transparency and Safety, the licensing application was subject to public enquiry that allowed the general public to submit requests for information regarding safety of the project. According to published safety assessments (approved by the ASN), in the worst case of reactor leak, released radioactivity will not exceed 1/1000 of natural background radiation and no evacuation of local residents will be required. The whole installation includes a number of stress tests to confirm efficiency of all barriers. The whole reactor building is built on top of almost 500 seismic suspension columns and the whole complex is located almost 300 m above sea level. Overall, extremely rare events such as 100-year flood of the nearby Durance river and 10,000-year earthquakes were assumed in the safety design of the complex and respective safeguards are part of the design.

Between 2008 and 2017, the project has generated 34,000 job-years in the EU economy alone. It is estimated that in the 2018–2030 period, it will generate a further 74,000 job-years and €15.9 billion in gross value.

<text>Agent Cody Banks is a 2003 American action comedy film directed by Harald Zwart. The film stars Frankie Muniz as a 15-year-old who has to finish his chores, avoid getting grounded, and save the world by going undercover for the CIA as a James Bond–type superspy. Hilary Duff, Angie Harmon, Keith David, Cynthia Stevenson, Daniel Roebuck, Darrell Hammond, Ian McShane, and Arnold Vosloo co-star. It was filmed in British Columbia and was released in the United States on March 14, 2003.

It was the first major film project for Duff apart from the film spinoff of &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;, as well as for Harmon, who had just come off a three-year stint as Assistant D.A. Abbie Carmichael on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. &quot;Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London&quot; was released the following year. &quot;Agent Cody Banks&quot;″s executive producers include Madonna (whose then-production company Maverick Films acquired the script) and Jason Alexander (he was originally attached to direct before being replaced by Vic Armstrong, who was ultimately replaced by Zwart).

==Plot==
Cody Banks, a 15-year-old high school junior, applies for a junior field ops position at the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s Special Activities Division after completing a training summer camp. Answering to his handler Agent Ronica Miles, Cody is called upon a mission to find information about a scientist named Dr. Albert Connors. Connors is employed by a SPECTRE-type organization named ERIS led by Dr. Brinkman and his henchman François Molay. As all CIA agents are known to Brinkman&#x27;s organization, the CIA uses the unknown Banks, who is placed into the prep school of Dr. Connors&#x27; daughter Natalie, the William Donovan Institute.

Cody soon finds he has no social skill with girls and has no time to do this while balancing his chores and homework. The CIA decides to help by doing his chores and homework, trying to build his status, and going into the school to set him up with Natalie. The CIA also assemble a varying team of &quot;experts&quot; to train Cody into how to talk to girls, and issue him with a variety of gadgets with various functions.

Eventually, Cody befriends and falls in love with Natalie after rescuing her from a falling a ladder while putting up a banner, and he is invited to her 16th birthday party, where he goes undercover to her father&#x27;s lab. Cody finds that Brinkman plans to use nanobots — which can destroy any carbon- or silicon-based substance — to destroy the world&#x27;s defense systems so he can threaten anyone who opposes him. Since the nanobots are inactive in the cold, he plans to use ice cubes to distribute them. After Connors, Brinkman, and François leave the lab, Cody tries taking one of the ice cubes, but melts when in his possession.

After Cody fights some delinquents at the party, the CIA suspends him from the mission. Meanwhile, with Connors refusing to aid him in his plans, Brinkman has François and his henchmen bring Natalie into his base in the Cascade Mountains. Meanwhile, Cody, disobeying orders to avoid Natalie, eats ice cream at a local restaurant with her. Cody attempts to explain things to Natalie but François and a group of henchmen ambush Cody and abduct Natalie.

With Cody removed from the mission, he gives his brother Alex the $5,000 from the CIA in exchange for keeping his disappearance a secret. Knowing Natalie&#x27;s location via a tracking device in a necklace he gave her as a birthday present, Cody travels to the mountains using a rocket powered snowboard and other devices. After being discovered by Ronica, Cody persuades her to help him rescue Natalie. The pair infiltrate the laboratory and Cody rescues Natalie, also explaining the truth about why he went out with her.

However, Brinkman holds Natalie hostage and puts an ice cube with a nanobot inside on her forehead to make her father program the system. Cody activates a series of explosive charges he and Ronica planted throughout the base, and in the ensuing battle, Ronica fights off several of Brinkman&#x27;s men, and Natalie places the ice cube with the nanobots into his mouth, causing the nanobots to devour him from the inside out. Cody later defeats François and sends him to the CIA using the SoloTrek XFV, before fleeing the exploding facility with Ronica, Natalie and Dr. Connors. The CIA welcomes Cody back to the team and congratulates him for completing the mission, and Cody and Natalie start a relationship.

==Cast==

==Production==
For his participation, Muniz was paid $2 million, the highest amount paid to a child actor at that point since Macaulay Culkin. &quot;Agent Cody Banks&quot; was developed as part of a broader strategy by MGM to make less-expensive films that can appeal to younger and niche audiences. Both Muniz and Angie Harmon did most of their own stunts. The film used Media.net’s Edit System Dailies to transfer pre-digitized Avid system files from the post production facility Rainmaker in Vancouver directly to the pic’s editing rooms in Los Angeles without having to wait for tapes to be delivered, allowing producers and executives to receive their viewing copies half a day sooner than through the traditional method. Principal photography took place in 2002 in Vancouver, British Columbia.

==Reception==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Agent Cody Banks&quot; holds a 38% approval rating and an average rating of 5.2/10 based on 104 reviews. The critics consensus states, &quot;Should satisfy young teens, but offers nothing new for those who are familiar with the formula.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a score of 41 out of 100 based on reviews from 24 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A-&quot; on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars. He said that kids would probably enjoy it, but, unlike the &quot;Spy Kids&quot; series, adults would probably not.

&quot;Agent Cody Banks&quot; opened at #2 with $14 million behind &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot;″s second weekend. By the time the film closed on July 31, 2003, it earned $48 million in the US and an additional $10.9 million internationally, adding up to a total $58.8 million.

Frankie Muniz&#x27;s character is asked twice if he is &quot;in special ed&quot;. When the film was released on home video, MGM included an apologetic paragraph in response to criticism regarding these lines.

==Sequel==
Muniz reprised his title role in the sequel, &quot;Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London&quot;, which was released on March 12, 2004. Duff and Angie Harmon were replaced by different characters played by Anthony Anderson and Hannah Spearritt.

<text>Dayton Clarence Miller (March 13, 1866 – February 22, 1941) was an American physicist, astronomer, acoustician, and accomplished amateur flautist. An early experimenter of X-rays, Miller was an advocate of aether theory and absolute space and an opponent of Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity.

Born in Ohio to Charles Webster Dewey and Vienna Pomeroy Miller, he graduated from Baldwin University in 1886 and obtained a doctorate in astronomy at Princeton University under Charles A. Young in 1890. Miller spent his entire career teaching physics at the Case School of Applied Science in Cleveland, Ohio, as head of the physics department from 1893 until his retirement in 1936. Following the discovery of X-rays by Wilhelm Röntgen in 1895, Miller used cathode-ray tubes built by William Crookes to make some of the first photographic images of concealed objects, including a bullet within a man&#x27;s limb. Active in many scientific organizations, Miller was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. During the 1920s, he served as secretary, vice president, and president of the American Physical Society and as chairman of the division of Physical Sciences of the National Research Council. Miller was a founding member of the Acoustical Society of America (ASA) and was the ASA president from 1931 to 1933. 

==Scientific contributions==

===Aether research===

In 1900, he began work with Edward Morley on the detection of aether drift, at the time one of the &quot;hot&quot; areas of fundamental physics. Following on with the basic apparatus as the earlier Michelson–Morley experiment, Miller and Morley published another null result in 1904. These experimental results were later cited in support of Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity.
Miller continued to work on refining his experimental techniques after 1904, conducting millions of measurements on aether drift, and eventually developing the most sensitive interferometer in the world at that time.

Dayton Miller performed over 326,000 turns of interferometer with 16 readings each one, (more than 5,200,000 measurements). They showed what appeared to be a small amount of drift (about 9 km/s, 1/3 of the velocity of the Earth around the Sun). With white light and 32 m arms he could see nearly always the same result:
* A shift amplitude of 0.12 ± 0.01 fringe, incompatible with zero.
* A shift phase that points to an apex in the constellation Dorado.

The amplitude analysis suggests a drag of aether. But the analysis of phase suggests that the Solar System goes towards the constellation Dorado at a speed of 227 km/s.
These results were presented by Miller as a positive indication of the existence of an aether drift. However, the effect Miller saw was tiny – much smaller than would be expected for a stationary aether. In order for these results to be consistent with an aether, it had to be assumed that the aether was dragged along with the Earth to a much greater extent than aether theories typically predicted. Values that high could be eliminated due to other physical phenomenon like stellar aberration, which put upper limits on the amount of dragging. Furthermore, the measurement was statistically far from any other measurements being carried on at the time. Fringe shifts of about 0.01 were being observed in many experiments, while Miller&#x27;s 0.08 was not duplicated anywhere else, including Miller&#x27;s own 1904 experiments with Morley, which showed a drift of only 0.015.

Based on an error analysis, Miller&#x27;s critics argued that he overestimated the precision of his results, and that his measurements were actually perfectly consistent with a fringe difference of zero—the null result that every other experiment was recording. However, Miller continued to defend his results, claiming that the probable reason for the so-called null results were that they were not being done at high locations (such as mountain tops), where the ether wind (drift) was supposedly much higher due to less ether drag. 
Einstein was interested in this aether drift theory and acknowledged that a positive result for the existence of aether would invalidate the theory of special relativity, but commented that altitudal influences and temperatures may have provided sources of error in the findings. Miller commented:
During the 1920s a number of experiments, both interferometry-based, as in Miller&#x27;s experiment, and others using entirely different techniques, were conducted, and these returned a null result as well. Even at the time, Miller&#x27;s work was increasingly considered to be a statistical anomaly, an opinion that remains true today, given an ever-growing body of negative results.
For example, Georg Joos reprised Miller&#x27;s experiment using a very similar setup (the arms of his interferometer were 21 m vs. the 32 m in the Miller experiment) and obtained results that were 1/50 the magnitude of those from Miller&#x27;s (see Michelson–Morley experiment#Subsequent experiments). However, Miller claimed that the explanation for results of the experiments of Georg Joos were because they were done at low altitude in the interior of a building, where the aether wind was very low.

===Shankland analysis===

In 1955, Robert S. Shankland, S. W. McCuskey, F. C. Leone, and G. Kuerti performed a re-analysis of Miller&#x27;s results. Shankland, who led the report, noted that the &quot;signal&quot; that Miller observed in 1933 is actually composed of points that are an average of several hundred measurements each, and the magnitude of the signal is more than 10 times smaller than the resolution with which the measurements were recorded. Miller&#x27;s extraction of a single value for the measurement is statistically impossible, the data is too variable to say &quot;this&quot; number is any better than &quot;that&quot;—the data, from Shankland&#x27;s position, supports a null result as equally as Miller&#x27;s positive.

Shankland concluded that Miller&#x27;s observed signal was partly due to statistical fluctuations and partly due to local temperature conditions, and also suggested that the results of Miller were due to a systematic error rather than an observed existence of aether. In particular, he felt that Miller did not take enough care in guarding against thermal gradients in the room where the experiment took place, as, unlike most interferometry experiments, Miller conducted his in a room where the apparatus was deliberately left open to the elements to some degree.

In Shankland&#x27;s analysis, no statistically significant signal for the existence of aether was found. Shankland concluded that Miller&#x27;s observed signal was spurious, due mainly to uncontrolled temperature effects rather than to the observed existence of an aether. In addition, some mainstream scientists today have argued that any signal that Miller observed was the result of the experimenter effect, i.e., a bias introduced by the experimenter&#x27;s wish to find a certain result, which was a common source of systematic error in statistical analysis of data before modern experimental techniques were developed. (This effect was not addressed by name in Miller&#x27;s early textbook on experimental techniques; see Ginn &amp; Company, 1903).

===Other endeavors===

Dr. Miller published manuals designed to be student handbooks for the performance of experimental problems in physics. In 1908, Miller&#x27;s interest in acoustics led him to develop a machine to record sound waves photographically, called the phonodeik. He used the machine to compare the waveforms produced by flutes crafted from different materials. During World War I, Miller worked with the physical characteristics of pressure waves of large guns at the request of the government. Dayton Miller was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1921. He was a member of the National Research Council in Washington, D.C. from 1927 to 1930.

<doc id="261366" wikidata="Q762043" url="?curid=261366" title="Dimerization">
<text>In chemistry, dimerization is the process of joining two identical or similar molecular entities by bonds. The resulting bonds can be either strong or weak. Many symmetrical chemical species are described as dimers, even when the monomer is unknown or highly unstable.

The term &quot;homodimer&quot; is used when the two subunits are identical (e.g. A–A) and &quot;heterodimer&quot; when they are not (e.g. A–B). The reverse of dimerization is often called dissociation. When two oppositely-charged ions associate into dimers, they are referred to as &quot;Bjerrum pairs&quot;, after Danish chemist Niels Bjerrum.

== Noncovalent dimers ==

Anhydrous carboxylic acids form dimers by hydrogen bonding of the acidic hydrogen and the carbonyl oxygen. For example, acetic acid forms a dimer in the gas phase, where the monomer units are held together by hydrogen bonds. Many OH-containing molecules form dimers, e.g. the water dimer.

Dimers that form based on weak electrostatic interaction and/or van der Waals interactions have a short lifetime, but can be stabilized through special laboratory setups such as matrix-isolation. A prominent example is the carbon dioxide dimer, which is likely to be relevant to Venus atmosphere. 

Excimers and exciplexes are excited structures with a short lifetime. For example, noble gases do not form stable dimers, but they do form the excimers Ar2*, Kr2* and Xe2* under high pressure and electrical stimulation.
== Covalent dimers ==
Molecular dimers are often formed by the reaction of two identical compounds e.g.: . In this example, monomer &quot;A&quot; is said to dimerize to give the dimer &quot;&quot;.

Dicyclopentadiene is an asymmetrical dimer of two cyclopentadiene molecules that have reacted in a Diels-Alder reaction to give the product. Upon heating, it &quot;cracks&quot; (undergoes a retro-Diels-Alder reaction) to give identical monomers:
:&lt;chem&gt;C10H12 -&gt; 2 C5H6&lt;/chem&gt;

Many nonmetallic elements occur as dimers: hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and the halogens fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. Some metals form a proportion of dimers in their vapour phase: dilithium (), disodium (), dipotassium (), dirubidium () and dicaesium (). Such elemental dimers are homonuclear diatomic molecules.

==Polymer chemistry==
In the context of polymers, &quot;dimer&quot; also refers to the degree of polymerization 2, regardless of the stoichiometry or condensation reactions.

One case where this is applicable is with disaccharides. For example, cellobiose is a dimer of glucose, even though the formation reaction produces water:
: &lt;chem&gt;2 C6H12O6 -&gt; C12H22O11 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
Here, the resulting dimer has a stoichiometry different from the initial pair of monomers.

Disaccharides need not be composed of the same monosaccharides to be considered dimers. An example is sucrose, a dimer of fructose and glucose, which follows the same reaction equation as presented above.

Amino acids can also form dimers, which are called dipeptides. An example is glycylglycine, consisting of two glycine molecules joined by a peptide bond. Other examples include aspartame and carnosine.

== Inorganic and organometallic dimers ==
Many molecules and ions are described as dimers, even when the monomer is elusive.

=== Boranes ===

Diborane (B2H6) is an dimer of borane, which is elusive and rarely observed. Almost all compounds of the type R2BH exist as dimers.

===Organoaluminium compounds===

Trialkylaluminium compounds can exist as either monomers or dimers, depending on the steric bulk of the groups attached. For example, trimethylaluminium exists as a dimer, but trimesitylaluminium adopts a monomeric structure.

===Organochromium compounds===
Cyclopentadienylchromium tricarbonyl dimer exists in measureable equilibrium quantities with the monometallic radical .

== Biochemical dimers ==

=== Pyrimidine dimers ===
Pyrimidine dimers (also known as thymine dimers) are formed by a photochemical reaction from pyrimidine DNA bases when exposed to ultraviolet light. This cross-linking causes DNA mutations, which can be carcinogenic, causing skin cancers. When pyrimidine dimers are present, they can block polymerases, decreasing DNA functionality until it is repaired.

=== Protein dimers ===

Protein dimers arise from the interaction between two proteins which can interact further to form larger and more complex oligomers. For example, tubulin is formed by the dimerization of α-tubulin and β-tubulin and this dimer can then polymerize further to make microtubules. For symmetric proteins, the larger protein complex can be broken down into smaller identical protein subunits, which then dimerize to decrease the genetic code required to make the functional protein.

=== G protein-coupled receptors ===
As the largest and most diverse family of receptors within the human genome, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) have been studied extensively, with recent studies supporting their ability to form dimers. GPCR dimers include both homodimers and heterodimers formed from related members of the GPCR family. While not all, some GPCRs require dimerization to function, such as GABAB-receptor, emphasizing the importance of dimers in biological systems.

=== Receptor tyrosine kinase ===
Much like for G protein-coupled receptors, dimerization is essential for receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) to perform their function in signal transduction, affecting many different cellular processes. RTKs typically exist as monomers, but undergo a conformational change upon ligand binding, allowing them to dimerize with nearby RTKs. The dimerization activates the cytoplasmic kinase domains that are responsible for further signal transduction.
