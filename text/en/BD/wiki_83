<text>A public service announcement (PSA) is a message in the public interest disseminated by the media without charge to raise public awareness and change behavior. Oftentimes these messages feature unsettling imagery, ideas or behaviors that are designed to startle or even scare the viewer into understanding the consequences of undergoing a particular harmful action or inaction (such as pictures of drug users before and after their addiction or realistic skits of domestic violence situations) as well as the importance of avoiding such choices. In the UK, they are generally called a [[public information film]] (PIF); in Hong Kong, they are known as an announcement in the public interest (API).

==History==
The earliest public service announcements (in the form of moving pictures) were made before and during the Second World War years in both the UK and the US.

In the UK, amateur actor Richard Massingham set up Public Relationship Films Ltd in 1938 as a specialist agency for producing short educational films for the public. In the films, he typically played a bumbling character who was slightly more stupid than average and often explained the message of the film by demonstrating the risks if it were ignored. The films covered topics such as how to cross the road, how to prevent the spread of diseases, how to swim, and how to drive without causing the road to be unsafe for other users. During the war, he was commissioned by the UK Ministry of Information to produce films for the war effort. Massingham began to produce longer films, for both private companies and the Government, after the War.

In the US, the Ad Council (initially called the War Advertising Council) was set up in 1941, when America entered World War II. It began implementing on a massive scale the idea of using advertising to influence American society on a range of fronts. Its first campaigns focused on the country&#x27;s needs during World War II, such as encouraging the American public to invest their savings in government bonds.

==In different countries==
===United Kingdom===
After the war, PIFs were used to educate the public on a broader range of issues. In the UK, they were produced for the Central Office of Information (COI), and again by private contractors, which were usually small film companies, such as Richard Taylor Cartoons. They were supplied to broadcasters free of charge for use at any time. Their utility as a cost-free means to fill the gaps in commercial breaks left by unsold advertising airtime has led to their regular usage since the 1960s.

===United States===
The most common topics of PSAs are health and safety, such as the multimedia &quot;Emergency Preparedness &amp; Safety Tips On Air and Online&quot; talk radio campaign. A typical PSA is part of a public awareness campaign to inform or educate the public about an issue such as obesity or compulsive gambling.

One of the earliest television public service announcements came in the form of Smokey Bear whose &quot;Only you can prevent forest fires&quot; campaign ran for decades. Other common early themes were traffic safety, especially safe crossing, wearing seat belts and not driving drunk, and the dangers of cigarette smoking.

A charitable organization may enlist the support of a celebrity for a PSA; examples include actress Kathryn Erbe telling people to be green and Crips gang leader Stanley Williams speaking from prison to urge youths not to join gangs or commit crimes.

Some television shows featuring very special episodes made PSAs after the episodes. For example, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; talked about child abduction in one episode, with a PSA about child abduction airing after the episode. After &quot;My Sister Sam&quot; was canceled in 1988, surviving cast members Pam Dawber, Joel Brooks, Jenny O&#x27;Hara, and David Naughton were reunited to film a PSA for the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence on gun control after the murder of their co-star, Rebecca Schaeffer, who was gunned down by a crazed fan on July 18, 1989, at Schaeffer&#x27;s apartment in Los Angeles.

During the 1980s, many American cartoon shows contained PSAs at the end of their shows to satisfy federal regulations that required programming for children to be educational. Examples include the closing moral segments at the end of &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot;, the &quot;Knowing is Half the Battle&quot; epilogues in &quot;G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero&quot;, &quot;The Transformers&quot;, &quot;Jem&quot;, &quot;M.A.S.K.&quot;, &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;, and the &quot;Sonic Says&quot; segments from &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;.

PSAs are used as placeholders for unsold commercials.

=== South Korea ===

PSAs in South Korea are produced by the Public Service Advertising Council, an organization under the Korea Broadcasting Advertisement Corporation (KOBACO). The Public Service Advertising Council is in charge of advisory roles such as selecting the topic of PSAs broadcast in Korea for one year, establishing public relations measures, and seeking strategies. The Public Service Advertising Council is made up of about 15 persons nominated by advertising academia, broadcasting, advertising industry, and civic groups.

The organization evolved from the &#x27;Broadcasting Advertising Improvement Advisory Committee&#x27; formed on August 18, 1981. After going through the &#x27;Public Service Advertising Improvement Advisory Committee&#x27; on February 7, 1983, the name was changed to the current name on July 1, 1988.

As of 2020, there are a total of 400 PSAs produced by the KOBACO.

=== China ===
China&#x27;s first PSAs in 1986 were about saving water and were broadcast on Guiyang television. In Hong Kong, terrestrial television networks have been required since National Day 2004 to preface their main evening news broadcasts with a minute-long announcement in the public interest which plays the Chinese National Anthem in Mandarin over various patriotic montages.

===Malaysia===
Filem Negara Malaysia (FNM) became the early pioneers of PSAs from its establishment in 1946. PSAs produced by FNM have topics such as dengue fever, drug addiction, environmental pollution, road safety and electricity usage. Governmental agencies such as Ministry of Health have produced PSAs to promote their Healthy Lifestyle Campaign which held annually since 1991, with the &quot;Utamakan Kesihatan&quot; (&quot;Prioritize Health&quot;) logo appearing at the end of their ads, most notably PSAs about AIDS.

PSAs on road safety were produced by Ministry of Transport, particularly on accidents amongst motorcyclists and alcohol consumption amongst drivers. Some of their ads also using &quot;Anda Mampu Mengubahnya&quot; (&quot;You Can Make a Difference&quot;) slogan and also using some of famous actors and actresses including the late Adibah Noor and Nabil Ahmad. Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment also produces PSAs focusing on environmental pollution. PSAs on corruption and bribery were produced by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Agency (now Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission). Most of these PSAs were aired on Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM) and TV Pendidikan between the 1990s and 2000s. Private TV networks like TV3 have also produced in-house PSAs, covering topics such as not downloading pirated content, some of which feature actress and infotainer, Janna Nick; and domestic violence which features actress Eyra Hazali.

There was a series of animated PSAs that was made by Filem Negara Malaysia from 2008 till 2013 which is also commonly known as &quot;Pak Abu PSAs&quot; and was frequently shown in Malaysian TV channels.

In 2021, the Malaysia Government produced a series of PSAs known as &quot;Lindung Diri, Lindung Semua&quot; (&quot;Protect Yourself, Protect All&quot;). The PSAs cover information about COVID-19 vaccines and the benefits of vaccination. The series also features the Prime Minister of Malaysia at that time, Muhyiddin Yassin.

==Festivals and contests==
IAA Responsibility Awards is an annual international festival of public service announcements, held by the &quot;International Advertising Association&quot; since 2008.

<doc id="267831" wikidata="Q7434407" url="?curid=267831" title="Scop">
<text>A  (
 or ) was a poet as represented in Old English poetry. The scop is the Old English counterpart of the Old Norse &quot;&quot;, with the important difference that &quot;skald&quot; was applied to historical persons, and scop is used, for the most part, to designate oral poets &quot;within&quot; Old English literature. Very little is known about scops, and their historical existence is questioned by some scholars.

== Functions ==

The scop, like the similar gleeman, was a reciter of poetry. The scop, however, was typically attached to a court on a relatively permanent basis. There, he most likely received rich gifts for his performances. The performances often featured the recitation of recognisable texts such as the &quot;old pagan legends of the Germanic tribes.&quot; However, the scop&#x27;s duties also included &quot;composing&quot; his own poetry in different situations, the eulogizing of his master. While some scops moved from court to court, they were (generally speaking) less nomadic than the gleemen and had positions of greater security.

== Etymology ==

Old English &#x27; and its cognate Old High German &#x27; (glossing &#x27; and &#x27;; also &#x27;) may be related to the verb &#x27; &quot;to create, form&quot; (Old Norse &#x27;, Old High German &#x27;; Modern English &quot;shape&quot;), from Proto-Germanic &#x27; &quot;form, order&quot; (from a PIE &#x27; &quot;cut, hack&quot;), perfectly parallel to the notion of craftsmanship expressed by the Greek &#x27; itself; Köbler (1993, p. 220) suggests that the West Germanic word may indeed be a calque of Latin &#x27;.

== &quot;Scop&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and relationship to &quot;scold&quot;==
While &#x27; became English &quot;scoff&quot;, the Old Norse &#x27; lives on in a Modern English word of a similarly deprecating meaning, &quot;scold&quot;. There is a homonymous Old High German &#x27; meaning &quot;abuse, derision&quot; (Old Norse &#x27;, meaning &quot;mocking, scolding&quot;, whence &quot;scoff&quot;), a third meaning &quot;tuft of hair&quot;, and yet another meaning &quot;barn&quot; (cognate to English &quot;shop&quot;). They may all derive from a Proto-Germanic &quot;&quot;.

The association with jesting or mocking was, however, strong in Old High German. There was a &#x27; glossing both &#x27; and &#x27; and a &#x27; glossing &#x27; and &#x27;. &#x27;, on the other hand, is of a higher register, glossing &#x27;. The words involving jesting are derived from another root, Proto-Indo-European &quot;*-&quot; &quot;push, thrust&quot;, related to English &quot;shove, shuffle&quot;, and the Oxford English Dictionary favours association of &quot;&quot; with that root. The question cannot be decided formally since the Proto-Germanic forms coincided in zero grade, and by the time of the surviving sources (from the late 8th century), the association with both roots may have influenced the word for several centuries.

== Literary fiction or reality==
The scholar of literature Seth Lerer suggests that &quot;What we have come to think of as the inherently &#x27;oral&#x27; quality of Old English Poetry... [may] be a literary fiction of its own.&quot; Scholars of Early English have different opinions on whether the Anglo-Saxon oral poet ever really existed. Much of the poetry that survives does have an oral quality to it, but some scholars argue that it is a trait carried over from an earlier Germanic period. If, as some critics believe, the idea of the Anglo-Saxon oral poet is based on the Old Norse Skald, it can be seen as a link to the heroic past of the Germanic peoples. There is no proof that the &quot;scop&quot; existed, and it could be a literary device allowing poetry to give an impression of orality and performance. This poet figure recurs throughout the literature of the period, whether real or not. Examples are the poems Widsith and Deor, in the Exeter Book, which draw on the idea of the mead-hall poet of the heroic age and, along with the anonymous heroic poem Beowulf express some of the strongest poetic connections to oral culture in the literature of the period.

The scholar and translator of Old English poetry Michael Alexander, introducing his 1966 book of &quot;The Earliest English Poems&quot;, treats the scop as a reality within an oral tradition. He writes that since all the material is traditional, the oral poet achieves mastery of alliterative verse when the use of descriptive half-line formulae has become &quot;instinctive&quot;; at that point he can compose &quot;with and through the form rather than simply &quot;in&quot; it&quot;. At that point, in Alexander&#x27;s view, the scop &quot;becomes invisible, and metre becomes rhythm&quot;.

The nature of the scop in &quot;Beowulf&quot; is addressed by another scholar-translator, Hugh Magennis, in his book &quot;Translating Beowulf&quot;. He discusses the poem&#x27;s lines 867–874, which describe, in his prose gloss, &quot;a man... mindful of songs, who remembered a multitude of stories from the whole range of ancient traditions, found new words, properly bound together&quot;. He notes that this offers &quot;an image of the poetic tradition in which &quot;Beowulf&quot; participates&quot;, an oral culture: but that &quot;in fact this narrator and this audience are [in this instance] a fiction&quot;, because when the &quot;Beowulf&quot; text is read out, the narrator is absent. So, while the poem feels like a scop&#x27;s &quot;oral utterance .. using the traditional medium of heroic poetry&quot;, it is actually &quot;a literate work, which offers a meditation on its [centuries old] heroic world rather than itself coming directly from such a world&quot;.

<text>Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport is a major public airport located in Broward County, Florida, United States, roughly southwest of downtown Fort Lauderdale and north of Miami. The second busiest of the Miami metropolitan area&#x27;s commercial airports, it is located off Interstate 595, Interstate 95, U.S. Route 1, Florida State Road A1A, and Florida State Road 5, and is bounded by the cities of Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood, and Dania Beach.

With over 700 daily flights to 135 domestic and international destinations, the airport has become an intercontinental gateway since the late 1990s, although Miami International Airport still handles most long-haul flights in and out of South Florida. It serves as a primary airport for the Fort Lauderdale, Pompano Beach, Coral Springs, and Boca Raton areas, and a secondary airport for parts of Miami and areas north of Boca Raton. The airport is a base for Allegiant Air and JetBlue – as well as for Spirit Airlines, which has its corporate headquarters located in nearby Miramar. It is also the primary South Florida airport for Southwest Airlines. 

The airport is classified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as a &quot;major hub&quot; facility serving commercial air traffic.

==History==
===1926–1959===
World War I aviator Merle Fogg purchased an abandoned nine-hole golf course that was destroyed in the 1926 Miami hurricane for $1,200 in 1928. On May 1, 1929, the airport officially opened as Merle Fogg Field, with two criss-cross unpaved runways. At the start of World War II, it was commissioned by the United States Navy and renamed Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale. The runways were paved, and a control tower was built. The base was initially used for refitting civil airliners for military service before they were ferried across the Atlantic to Europe and North Africa. NAS Fort Lauderdale later became a main training base for Naval Aviators and enlisted naval air crewmen flying the Grumman TBF and TBM Avenger for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps aboard aircraft carriers and from expeditionary airfields ashore. NAS Fort Lauderdale was the home base for Flight 19, the five TBM Avengers that disappeared in December 1945, leading in part to the notoriety of the Bermuda Triangle.

NAS Fort Lauderdale closed on October 1, 1946, and was transferred to county control, becoming Broward County International Airport.

Commercial flights to Nassau began on June 2, 1953, and domestic flights began in 1958–1959: Northeast Airlines and National Airlines DC-6Bs flew nonstop to New York–Idlewild, and Northeast flew nonstop to Washington–National. In 1959, the airport opened its first permanent terminal building and assumed its current name.

===1960–1999===
In 1966, the airport averaged 48 airline operations a day; in 1972, it averaged 173 a day.

The Feb 1966 Official Airline Guide shows three nonstop departures to New York–JFK and no other nonstop flights beyond Tampa and Orlando. Five years later, FLL had added nonstop flights to Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Buffalo, Chicago–O&#x27;Hare, Cleveland, Detroit, Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York–LaGuardia, Newark, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh. (Northeast&#x27;s nonstop to Los Angeles had already been dropped.)

By 1974, the airport was served by Braniff International Airways, Delta Air Lines, Eastern Air Lines, National Airlines, Northwest Orient Airlines, Shawnee Airlines and United Airlines. Delta and Eastern were the dominant carriers, with 12 and 14 routes from FLL respectively. By 1979, following deregulation, Air Florida, Bahamasair, Florida Airlines, Mackey International Airlines, Republic Airlines, Trans World Airlines and Western Airlines also served the airport.

Low-cost airline traffic grew in the 1990s, with Southwest opening its base in 1996, Spirit in 1999, and JetBlue in 2000. Spirit Airlines made FLL a hub in 2002. In 2003, JetBlue made FLL a focus city. US Airways also planned a hub at Fort Lauderdale in the mid-2000s as part of its reorganization strategy before its merger with America West Airlines. Eventually, low-cost competition forced several major legacy airlines to cut back service to FLL, with United pulling out of the airport entirely in 2008 and American Airlines moving its New York and Los Angeles services to West Palm Beach in 2013.

===2000–2014===
In January 2000, South African Airways (SAA) introduced service from Cape Town to Atlanta via Fort Lauderdale on a Boeing 747. The flight from Atlanta to Cape Town operated nonstop. Fort Lauderdale served both as a refueling stop and as a place to pick up passengers. SAA had just started code-sharing with Delta Air Lines, which offered several flights from the airport. Changes to security regulations following the September 11 attacks forced SAA to eliminate the stop.

During the 2005 hurricane season, FLL was affected by Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Wilma. Katrina struck land in late August as a Category 1 and made landfall on Keating Beach just two miles from the airport (near the border of Broward and Miami–Dade counties) with winds but caused only minor damage; however, the airport was closed for about a 48-hour period. However, when Hurricane Wilma made landfall in October roof damage was reported along with broken windows, damaged jetways, and destroyed canopies. The airport was closed for a period of five days. Hurricane Wilma was a Category 2 when its center passed to the west of FLL. In February 2007, the airport started fees to all users, including private aircraft. FLL is one of the few airports to administer fees to private pilots. A minimum charge of $10 is assessed on landing private aircraft.

In May 2008, Zoom Airlines launched a seasonal link to London&#x27;s Gatwick Airport via Bermuda. The airline shut down three months later. In May 2010, Condor began a seasonal flight to Frankfurt. Norwegian Air Shuttle introduced routes to Copenhagen and Oslo in November 2013 and to Stockholm the following month. The company expanded its operations in Fort Lauderdale over the next few years. By 2017, Norwegian had established a crew base at the airport and added flights to three more cities in Europe, as well as seasonal service to two Caribbean destinations.

===2015–present===

Emirates launched a flight to Dubai using a Boeing 777-200LR in December 2016. While major airlines tended to prefer flying into Miami, Emirates chose Fort Lauderdale as its gateway to South Florida because of its codeshare agreement with JetBlue and the airport&#x27;s central location in the region. On January 6, 2017, a lone gunman opened fire inside Terminal 2 with a semi-automatic handgun, killing five people. The shooter was arrested by a BSO deputy within 85 seconds of when he began shooting. He was sentenced to five consecutive life sentences plus 120 years in prison. In 2018, NORAD announced that it would be stationing fighter jets at the airport during President Donald Trump&#x27;s trips to Mar-a-Lago. By 2018, the airport had started going through an extensive renovation and expansion project worth approximately $3 billion, adding gates, new parking, stores, and shops. The master plan calls for the construction of an Intermodal center, a people mover, a hotel, an increase in the number of gates from 62 to 95, and widening of the terminal access road.

Emirates ended service to Fort Lauderdale in 2020. In 2021, it began flying to Miami instead, which had more cargo traffic and connecting flights to other countries. In the same year, Norwegian decided to discontinue all of its flights to the United States, leaving the airport without transatlantic service. Norse Atlantic Airways launched a direct flight to Oslo in June 2022. In April 2023, historic flooding in the area caused severe disruptions at the airport, culminating in a complete closure as rainwater flooded parts of the tarmac and airport property. Norse Atlantic relocated to Miami in pursuit of more passengers and cargo in September 2023. The airline was also flying to London-Gatwick and had a crew base in Fort Lauderdale at the time. In the same month, El Al commenced a seasonal route to Tel Aviv for the Jewish High Holidays. It transitioned to year-round service in April 2024 despite the ongoing Israel–Hamas war and an Iranian attack on Israel two days prior. After Miami, Fort Lauderdale was El Al&#x27;s second destination in South Florida, which has a large Jewish population. In October 2023, one month following El Al&#x27;s commencement of service at the airport, officials broke ground on FLL&#x27;s new Terminal 5, which is expected to be completed by mid-2026.

In 2024, Southwest shifted its international flights from Fort Lauderdale to its hub in Orlando.

=== Future ===
Several airport projects are planned or underway as of 2024, to be completed by the end of the decade, in line with the airport&#x27;s master plan. These include the construction of airside terminal connections between Terminals 1, 2, and 3, the intermodal center, Terminal 5, and an automated people mover connecting the terminals, garages, and the intermodal center. Additionally, the Palm Garage is to be reconstructed, with an on-site hotel &amp; conference center built adjacent to the reconstructed garage, while Terminal 3 will be rebuilt &amp; expanded and a station on the proposed Broward Commuter Rail section of the FEC Coastal Link is established.

An elevated light rail service known as PREMO Light Rail linking the airport, the Broward County Convention Center, and Port Everglades is also proposed. As of 2024, this first phase of the light rail system is anticipated to be completed by 2028.

==Facilities==


Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport, located in an unincorporated area, covers and has two runways:

* 10L/28R: 9,000 x 150 ft (2,743 x 46 m), asphalt
* 10R/28L: 8,000 x 150 ft (2,438 x 46 m), concrete (enlarged September 18, 2014)
The former crosswind runway, 13/31, was closed and decommissioned in 2013 as part of the Airport Expansion Program, which also extended runway 10R/28L to its current length.

In December 2022, there were 100 aircraft based at this airport: 11 single-engine, 7 multi-engine, 80 jet, and 2 helicopter.

Silver Airways has its headquarters in Suite 201 of the 1100 Lee Wagener Blvd building. When Chalk&#x27;s International Airlines existed, its headquarters was on the grounds of the airport in an unincorporated area.

===Terminals===
Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport operates four terminals with 66 gates, with another terminal under construction as of 2024. Terminal 1 opened in stages between 2001 and 2003 and was designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum and Cartaya Associates. The other three terminals were constructed in 1986 and designed by Reynolds, Smith &amp; Hills as part of a $263 million construction project. Terminal 4 was inaugurated by a Concorde visit in 1983. Since 2005, T4 has been undergoing renovations along with a major expansion designed by PGAL/Zyscovich joint venture. The airport announced in late 2013 that T1 would undergo a $300 million makeover, and soon after construction began in late 2015 and was completed in June 2017. As of 2024, Terminal 5 is under construction and is expected to be completed by 2026.

Terminal 1, previously known as the Yellow Terminal, contains Concourses A, B &amp; C and 23 gates. Concourse A mainly serves international travelers. United Airlines operates a United Club in Concourse C, which originally opened with the new Terminal in May 2001 as a Continental Airlines Presidents Club before United merged with Continental Airlines. This terminal is also the most frequently used of the four by Southwest Airlines; nearly all Southwest flights operate out of Concourse B.

Terminal 2, previously known as the Red Terminal, contains Concourse D and 9 gates. Air Canada and Delta Air Lines operate at Terminal 2. Due to construction in Terminal 1, WestJet currently operates from Terminal 2 as well. Delta Air Lines operates a Sky Club here. This terminal is currently undergoing a $100 million modernization, including the expansion of the check-in area, renovations to security screening facilities, new ceilings, flooring, and the inclusion of more concessions, along with the modernization of the Sky Club.

Terminal 3, previously known as the Purple Terminal, contains Concourses E &amp; F with 20 gates, functioning as the JetBlue operating base. It is also connected to Terminal 4 via a newly built walkway.

Terminal 4, previously known as the Green Terminal, contains Concourse G with 14 gates, and functions as the Spirit operating base. Concourse H, which closed in December 2017 and has since been demolished, included 10 gates. The former Concourse H was reconfigured and redesigned by the architectural firms of PGAL/Zyscovich joint venture. The new three-story facility, which was renamed Concourse G, has 14 new gates, 11 of which are international/domestic capable, and one arrival area for bussing operations.

===Ground transportation===

Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport is near the Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport at Dania Beach train station served by Tri-Rail commuter trains – as well as the Fort Lauderdale station serving Brightline. Both Tri-Rail and Brightline provides a shuttle bus service from their respective stations to three locations at the airport, all on the lower level: the west end of terminal 1, between terminals 2 &amp; 3, and between terminals 3 &amp; 4. The shuttles operate seven days a week; the Tri-Rail shuttle is free for Tri-Rail customers.

The terminals are accessible by U.S. Route 1. Other major roads that border the airport include Florida State Road 818, Interstate 95, and Interstate 595. U.S. Route 1 includes an underpass under Runway 10R/28L.

Ride-sharing companies can also be used to and from the airport in designated pickup and drop-off places found between Terminals 1 &amp; 2 and Terminals 3 &amp; 4.

The airport also offers airport parking and operates a consolidated rental car facility which can be accessed directly Terminal 1 and from the other terminals by a free shuttle bus service.

FLL is served by Broward County Transit bus Route 1 which offers connecting service through the Broward Central Terminal in downtown Fort Lauderdale, and also serves to Aventura Mall in Aventura, Florida, in Miami-Dade County.

===Art===
Internationally known artist and sculptor Duane Hanson created an installation for his work &quot;Vendor with Walkman&quot; at the Departure Level of Terminal 3 at the airport. Hanson, who retired and died in nearby Boca Raton, created a seated middle-aged man wearing a red T-shirt, blue pants, and baseball cap, and listening to a walkman during a break. The installation accessories give additional clues to the narrative of the artwork: toy airplane, various signs, and announcements for the shop, janitorial supplies. The artwork has since been moved to Terminal 1 Arrival Level.

<text>The Annual Register (originally subtitled &quot;A View of the History, Politicks and Literature of the Year ...&quot;) is a long-established reference work, written and published each year, which records and analyses the year&#x27;s major events, developments and trends throughout the world. It was first written in 1758 under the editorship of Edmund Burke, and has been produced continuously since that date. In its current form the first half of the book comprises articles on each of the world&#x27;s countries or regions, while the latter half contains articles on international organisations, economics, the environment, science, law, religion, the arts and sport, together with obituaries, a chronicle of major events and selected documents. In addition to being produced annually in hardback, the book is also published electronically, and its entire 260-year archive is available online from its publisher, ProQuest.

==Edmund Burke and the creation of &quot;The Annual Register&quot;==

&quot;The Annual Register&quot; was created in 1758 by the publishers James and Robert Dodsley. On 24 April 1758 the Dodsley brothers signed a contract with Edmund Burke (1729–97) to write and edit the material for &quot;The Annual Register&quot;, which was conceived as an annual publication which would review the history, politics and literature of the day. Born in Ireland, Burke had trained as a lawyer before abandoning this field and turning to writing. He was an up-and-coming member of the intelligentsia and had already written several notable works, published by Dodsley. According to his contract with Dodsley, Burke was paid £100 per annum as editor of &quot;The Annual Register&quot;.

In its original form, &quot;The Annual Register&quot; comprised a long historical essay on the “History of the Present War” (the Seven Years&#x27; War 1756–63), a Chronology, which gave an account of interesting and noteworthy events in Britain over the previous year, and a collection of “State Papers”, a miscellany of primary source material which included official documents, speeches, letters and accounts. In his preface to the 1758 volume Burke noted the difficulties he had faced in writing the history section of the book. Taking the “broken and unconnected materials” and creating from them “one connected narrative” had been, he commented, “a work of more labour than may at first appear”. Nevertheless, his perseverance and skill as a historian meant that by the time of its publication the first volume of &quot;The Annual Register&quot; contained a unique, contemporaneous account of the war, analysing its origins and development with a perspective not readily available at the time in newspapers or magazines. As a result, the book sold widely, with the first volume going through five editions in its first 10 years.

Given the conventions of the day, within which journalism was seen as a disreputable profession for a gentleman, Burke was publicly reticent about his connection with &quot;The Annual Register&quot;. However, his biographers are in agreement that Burke wrote and edited the book single-handedly until 1765, when he entered Parliament. From this time Thomas English was closely involved in writing the book and is regarded by some authorities as having taken over the editorship from Burke in that year. Scholars are divided on the question of Burke&#x27;s association with the book thereafter, although many suggest that he continued to contribute to the history section and that he played a significant role in overseeing &quot;The Annual Register&quot;″s compilation until the 1790s, even though much of the editorial work by this stage was being done by others.

==Competing editions==
By the 1760s &quot;The Annual Register&quot; had established itself as amongst the most respected journals in print. However, the immense scale of the work meant that its early years were characterised by frequent delays in publication and a chaotic period in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries when there were two competing versions of the title, each claiming to be its legitimate incarnation.

Having been created in 1758, &quot;The Annual Register&quot; was published by the Dodsley brothers until 1763 and, following Robert Dodsley&#x27;s death, by James Dodsley alone until 1790. The sequence of Dodsley volumes was confused, however, by the practice of falsely dating a number of first editions in order to conceal the increasing delays (on occasions up to three years) between the year of publication and the year of the events described within a particular volume. A number of reprints and “counterfeit firsts” were also issued during the Dodsley period.

Following the publication of the 1790 volume in December 1793, Dodsley disposed of &quot;The Annual Register&quot;. He sold the stock and copyright of the volumes already issued to Messrs Otridge and assigned responsibility for future volumes to another publisher, Rivington. Under the new publisher the delays increased further, with the 1792 volume of the “Genuine” &quot;Annual Register&quot; not appearing until September 1798 (three months after the death of Thomas English) and the 1793 volume not being printed until July 1806. During this period Otridge produced volumes of its own “Original” &quot;Annual Register&quot;, covering the missing years and selling them at 8 shillings, compared with the 13 shillings charged by Rivington. Faced with this competition from a rival with greater resources, Rivington attempted to make good the arrears while also bringing out subsequent volumes more promptly. Some ground was recovered, although a number of years had still not been produced (1813–19) when Rivington finally went into partnership with Baldwin Craddock and Joy, a publisher which had already acquired a major share of Otridge in 1815. Thus, from the 1825 edition (produced in 1826) the competing &quot;Annual Registers&quot; were combined by Baldwin and Co. into a single title.

==Subsequent developments==

During the remainder of the nineteenth century &quot;The Annual Register&quot; was published without major difficulty. Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, it had adopted a format which gave a number of chapters to the history of Britain and followed closely the proceedings of Parliament. There followed chapters covering other countries in turn, no longer confined only to Europe. Its expanded history section meant that there was less of the miscellaneous material which had characterised its earlier volumes. Nevertheless, poetry remained included until 1862 and the book continued to reflect topical issues of the day.

In 1947 &quot;The Annual Register&quot; acquired an advisory board for the first time consisting of the then editor, Ivison Macadam, the assistant editor, Hugh Latimer, and five representatives nominated by: the English Association, the Arts Council of Great Britain, the British Association for the Advancement of Science, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, and the Royal Historical Society. Explaining this innovation, Macadam stated in the preface to the 1947 volume that it was “a recognition of the need for specialisation in these complicated times”.

In 1994, after a century&#x27;s ownership by Longman, &quot;The Annual Register&quot; was transferred to Cartermill. In 1996 it was sold to a US publisher, Keesing&#x27;s Worldwide, which oversaw the process of digitising the book&#x27;s extensive archive and making this available for the first time to subscribers. In late 2005 the title was bought by another US publisher, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts, which subsequently became ProQuest.

===List of editors===

Although it is agreed that Edmund Burke was the first editor of &quot;The Annual Register&quot; and held the post from 1758 to 1765, the date upon which he relinquished the editorship is uncertain.

It is only possible to record with accuracy those editors of the book from the modern period. The following list shows which volumes were produced by specific editors.

* M. Epstein (1922–1945)
* H.T. Montague Bell (1946)
* Ivison S. Macadam (1947–1972)
* Harry Hodson (1973–1987)
* Alan J. Day (1988–1999)
* D.S. Lewis (2000–2009)
* D.S. Lewis &amp; Wendy Slater (2010–present)

==&quot;The Annual Register&quot; today==
===Editorial aims===
&quot;The Annual Register&quot; in its current form aims to provide an authoritative, accurate, and interesting summary of the history of the year. This includes charting the immediate history of individual countries and also covering developments across a broad spectrum of science and the humanities. It aims to maintain &quot;The Annual Register&quot;’s traditional role as a well-respected reference work, while also providing an interesting and lively read.

===Modern format===
&quot;The Annual Register&quot; begins with an overview of the year, a thought-provoking essay by an established modern historian. In recent years, the authors of this article have included Paul Rogers, Anatol Lieven, Philip M.H. Bell, M.R.D. Foot, Richard Overy, and J.M. Roberts. There then follow articles on each country (or group of countries) in the world, ranging from a few hundred to 10,000 words in length. The second half of the book contains articles on major international and regional organisations, and essays on various topics. These include developments in the international economy, science and the environment, law and religion, and the arts and sport. The final sections of the book contain selected documents and statistics, an obituary section, and a day-by-day chronicle of the year’s events. A number of maps and colour photographs are included to illustrate the year’s key stories.

===Contributors===
Each article is written by an expert in that field. Of the ninety or so contributors, some of whom have written for &quot;The Annual Register&quot; for 40 years, the vast majority are academics or journalists. Although the contributors are scattered throughout the world, the publisher invites them to an annual dinner, which serves as a forum for discussion of the book, and at which a traditional toast “to the immortal memory of Edmund Burke” is still drunk in port, after the meal.

===Advisory board members===
The current advisory board of &quot;The Annual Register&quot; consists of the joint editors (D. S. Lewis and Wendy Slater), and the following luminaries, who are nominated by various learned societies.

* Chairman: Alastair Niven, LVO, OBE, Fellow, Harris Manchester College, University of Oxford (nominated by the British Council)
* Edward Fisher, MA, DM, FRCS (ORL), Consultant ear, nose and throat surgeon; Editor, Journal of Laryngology and Otology
* Richard O&#x27;Brien (nominated by the Royal Economic Society)
* David Reynolds, FBA, Professor of International History, University of Cambridge (nominated by the Royal Historical Society)
* Caroline Soper, Series editor, &quot;Insights&quot; (nominated by the Royal Institute of International Affairs)
* Lorelly Wilson, FRSC, MBE, Professor of Science and Engineering, University of Chester (nominated by the British Science Association)

The annual board meetings are also attended by representatives of the publisher.

===Current editors===
D. S. Lewis studied history and economics at Manchester University, and took his PhD there in 1983. In 1987 he published &quot;Illusions of Grandeur: Mosley, Fascism and British Society&quot; (MUP), and from 1997 to 2007 he served as editor of &quot;Keesing’s Record of World Events&quot;. He became chairman of the Advisory Board of &quot;The Annual Register&quot; in 1999 but stepped down in the following year upon becoming the book&#x27;s editor.

Wendy Slater read Russian at the University of Cambridge and Soviet studies at Manchester. After several years in journalism she obtained her PhD from Cambridge in 1998, and from 1999 to 2003 was lecturer in Russian contemporary history at the UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies (SSEES), a post which she left after becoming deputy editor of &quot;The Annual Register&quot; in 2002. In 2007, she published &quot;The Many Deaths of Nicholas II: Relics, remains and the Romanovs&quot; (Routledge).

===Current publisher===
&quot;The Annual Register&quot; is currently published by ProQuest. The company (then called CSA) bought the title in late 2005 from Keesing&#x27;s Worldwide.

===Winner of 2008 reference award===
In 2008 the board of judges of the Specialized Information Publishers Association (SIPA) awarded &quot;The Annual Register&quot; the 2008 Best Reference Publication prize for its &quot;editorial excellence&quot;.

===Online archive===
The entire archive of &quot;The Annual Register&quot; is currently available to subscribers online. This includes every volume published since 1758 and is updated annually when each new volume is completed. Each page has been scanned. Text has been captured through OCR (optical character recognition) for the earlier volumes, while recent volumes have text taken directly from the files used for the print publication. The online version includes contents tables and indexes to enable users to browse individual volumes. It also allows for keyword searches within the whole text.

== &quot;The Annual Register&quot; Edmund Burke Lectures==

<doc id="267842" wikidata="Q1069609" url="?curid=267842" title="Western Zhou">
<text>The Western Zhou (; 771 BC) was a period of Chinese history corresponding roughly to the first half of the Zhou dynasty. It began when King Wu of Zhou overthrew the Shang dynasty at the Battle of Muye and ended in 771 BC when Quanrong pastoralists sacked the Zhou capital at Haojing and killed King You of Zhou. The &quot;Western&quot; label for the period refers to the location of the Zhou royal capitals, which were clustered in the Wei River valley near present-day Xi&#x27;an.

The early Zhou state was ascendant for about 75 years; thereafter, it gradually lost power. The former lands of the Shang were divided into hereditary fiefs that became increasingly independent of the Zhou king over time. The Zhou court was driven out of the Wei River valley in 771 BC: this marked the beginning of the Eastern Zhou period, wherein political power was wielded in actuality by the king&#x27;s nominal vassals.

== Sources ==
The Western Zhou are known from archaeological finds, including substantial inscriptions, mostly on bronze ritual vessels.
In contrast to earlier periods, this direct evidence can be usefully compared with texts transmitted through the manuscript tradition.
These include some Confucian classics, the oldest parts of which are thought to date from this period.
Texts from the Warring States period and Han dynasty provide fuller accounts, though further removed from the original events.

=== Archaeology ===
Zhou ritual bronzes have been collected since the Song dynasty and are now scattered in collections around the world.
Scientific excavations began in the core Wei River valley and the Luoyang areas in the 1930s and expanded to a broader area from the 1980s.
Bronze vessels are a key marker of Western Zhou sites, including buildings, workshops, city walls and burials.
Elite burials usually contain sets of vessels, which can be dated using known variations in styles, as well the paleography and content of inscriptions.
Hundreds of hoards of bronzes have been found in Shaanxi, dating from the fall of the western capital in 771 BC.
A hoard typically contains treasured vessels accumulated by a family over three centuries, carefully buried to hide them from the invaders.

=== Inscriptions ===
The Zhou produced thousands of inscriptions, mostly on bronze ritual vessels and often considerably longer than those of the Late Shang.
The character forms and language of these inscriptions are obscure, and their interpretation rests heavily on transmitted texts.

A vessel was typically cast for some member of the Zhou elite, recording a relevant event or an honour bestowed on the owner by the king.
In the latter case, the inscription might include a narrative of the ceremony and report the speech of participants.
These give a rich insight into Zhou governance and the upper levels of Zhou society.

Many inscriptions contain details that may be compared with later histories.
More than a hundred of them commemorate a royal appointment to some government position.
More than 50 of them describe military campaigns.
Naturally the picture is incomplete, as very few inscriptions touch on military defeats or failures of government.

Inscriptions usually contain some dating information, but not the name of the current king.
Scholars have devised a range of criteria to narrow down the reign of an inscription, including the style of the vessel, the form of the characters and details within the text.

=== Classics ===

The earliest received texts, including parts of the &quot;Book of Odes&quot; and the &quot;Book of Documents&quot;, are believed to date from the Western Zhou period.

The &quot;Book of Odes&quot; is a collection of songs, traditionally divided as 160 State Airs, 105 Court Songs (Major and Minor) and 40 Hymns (Zhou, Lu and Song), set to melodies that have since been lost.
Most specialists agree that the Zhou Hymns date to the Western Zhou, followed by the Court Songs and the Airs of the States.
The Airs are said to have been collected from throughout the Western Zhou domains, but have a consistency and elegance that suggests that they were polished by the literati of the Zhou court.

The &quot;Book of Documents&quot; is a collection of formal speeches presented as spanning two millennia from the legendary Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors to the Spring and Autumn period.
Most scholars agree that the &quot;Old Script&quot; chapters are post-Han forgeries, and that many of the remaining &quot;Modern Script&quot; chapters were written long after the periods they purport to represent.
The five &quot;announcement&quot; (or &quot;proclamation&quot;) chapters use the most archaic language, similar to that of bronze inscriptions, and are thought to have been recorded close to the events of the early Western Zhou reigns they describe.
However, they feature significant differences in vocabulary, grammar and outlook from bronze inscriptions dated to that period, and may date from the middle or late Western Zhou.
Four more chapters, &quot;Catalpa Timbers&quot;, &quot;Many Officers&quot;, &quot;Take No Ease&quot; and &quot;Many Regions&quot;, are set in the same period, but their language suggests that they were written late in the Western Zhou period.
The prefaces written for each chapter, tying the &quot;Documents&quot; together as a continuous account, are thought to have been written in the Western Han period.

Texts transmitted from the Warring States period relate traditions from the Western Zhou period.
The &quot;Discourses of Zhou&quot; chapter of the &quot;Guoyu&quot; includes speeches claimed to be from the time of King Mu onward.
The &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; is primarily concerned with the Spring and Autumn period, but contains many references to events in the preceding Western Zhou period.

The &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot; provides a wealth of attractive detail, often varying from other sources, but its transmission history presents many problems.
The original text was a chronicle of the state of Wei buried in a royal tomb in the early 3rd century BC and recovered in the late 3rd century AD, but lost before the Song dynasty.
Two versions exist today: an &quot;ancient text&quot; assembled from quotations in other works and a fuller &quot;current text&quot; that Qian Daxin pronounced a forgery but some scholars believe contains authentic material.

The standard account is found in the &quot;Basic Annals of Zhou&quot;, chapter 4 of the &quot;Historical Records&quot; compiled by the Han dynasty historian Sima Qian.
This account is a synthesis of earlier sources, relying most heavily on the &quot;Book of Documents&quot; for the early kings and the &quot;Guoyu&quot; for early ancestors and the middle and late Western Zhou period.

== History ==

Most scholars divide the Western Zhou into early, middle and late periods, which also correspond roughly to stylistic changes in bronze vessels.
The Han historian Sima Qian felt unable to extend his chronological table beyond 841 BC, the first year of the Gonghe Regency, and there is still no accepted chronology of Chinese history before that point.
The &quot;Cambridge History of Ancient China&quot; used dates determined by Edward L. Shaughnessy from the &quot;current text&quot; &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot; and bronze inscriptions.
In 2000, the Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project produced a schedule of dates based on received texts, bronze inscriptions, radiocarbon dating and astronomical events.
However, several bronze inscriptions discovered since then are inconsistent with the project&#x27;s dates.

=== Conquest of the Shang ===
The origins of the Zhou are obscure.
The archaeology of pre-conquest Wei valley is varied and complex, but no material culture comparable to the dynastic Zhou has been found.
Archaeologists searching for the predynastic Zhou have focused on the Qishan area, which is mentioned in early texts and was a key ritual centre of the Western Zhou.
Two different pottery types are found in this area, and archaeologists differ on whether one or the other group of people, or a mixture of the two, produced the Zhou.
It is likely that several groups from across Shaanxi banded together to conquer the Shang.

The conquest is reflected in the material record by the sudden appearance throughout the Wei River basin of burials in the Shang style and sophisticated bronze vessels of all the types produced by the Shang, from which the Zhou had evidently acquired skilled craftsmen, scribes and abundant resources.
They also expanded the Late Shang practice of inscribing bronze vessels to create lengthy texts recording the accomplishments of their owners and honours bestowed on them by the king. The inscriptions also show that the Zhou had adopted Shang ancestor ritual. This adoption of Shang features suggests an effort to legitimate Zhou rule.
However, the Zhou did not adopt human sacrifice, which was so extensive in the Late Shang, or even mention it in any of their texts.

The Shi Qiang &quot;pan&quot;, part of a family cache found in western Shaanxi, was cast in the reign of King Gong by the latest in a family of scribes descended from a scribe brought to Shaanxi after the conquest.
The lengthy inscription, summarizing the history of the Zhou and that of the Wei () family, begins:

Accordant with antiquity was King Wen! (He) first brought harmony to government. The Lord on High sent down fine virtue and great security. Extending to the high and low, he joined the ten thousand states.

Capturing and controlling was King Wu! (He) proceeded and campaigned through the four quarters, piercing Yin [= Shang] and governing its people. Eternally unfearful of the Di (Distant Ones), oh, he attacked the Yi minions.

Longer accounts are found in later sources.
Both the &quot;Historical Records&quot; and the &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot; describe campaigns by King Wen in southern Shanxi.
King Wen moved the Zhou capital from Qiyi to Feng, and his son, King Wu, made a further move to Hao across the Feng River.
King Wu expanded his father&#x27;s campaigns to the Shang, defeating them in the decisive Battle of Muye, which is also described in the &quot;Great brightness&quot; song of the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;.
According to the &quot;Yi Zhou Shu&quot;, the Zhou army spent two months in the area mopping up resistance before returning to the Wei valley.
King Wen left two or three of his brothers (depending on the source) to oversee the former Shang domains, nominally ruled by Wu Geng, the son of the last Shang king.

=== Civil war and expansion ===
King Wu died two or three years after the conquest, triggering a crisis of the young state.
According to the traditional histories, one of King Wu&#x27;s brothers, the Duke of Zhou declared himself regent for King Wu&#x27;s son, the future King Cheng.
Later Confucian scholars, who glorified the Duke of Zhou, described the young king as a babe in his mother&#x27;s arms, but other evidence indicates that he was a young man at the time.
Some authors suggest that the Duke appointed himself king, and in the &quot;Announcement to Kang&quot; chapter of the &quot;Book of Documents&quot; he seems to speak as a king.

Wu Geng and the brothers of King Wu tasked with supervising him rebelled against the new regime.
The Duke of Zhou and his half-brother, the Duke of Shao, organized another eastern campaign.
After three years they had regained the lost areas and expanded their domain over an area stretching into Shandong.

The victorious triumvirate of the Duke of Zhou, Duke of Shao and King Cheng then consolidated their control over this expanded territory.
They built an eastern capital at Chengzhou (modern day Luoyang) and began founding colonies or states at strategic points in their domain.
The most important were placed under members of the ruling () family.
These colonies are listed in the &quot;Zuozhuan&quot;, and some have been confirmed by archaeological finds.
The inscription on the Mai &quot;zun&quot; narrates the ceremony in which King Cheng appointed a son of the Duke of Zhou to rule Xing.

Kings Cheng and Kang mounted numerous military campaigns to expand their domains.
The Xiao Yu &quot;ding&quot; relates a victory over the Guifang, presumably in the Ordos region, late in the reign of King Kang.
This phase of expansion came to an end in a disastrous southern campaign in the Han River region, in which King Zhao lost his armies and his own life.

=== Middle period ===

During the reign of King Mu, the Zhou state shifted to the defensive, particularly in the east.
The &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot; records a campaign against the Xu Rong, who had to be driven back from the eastern capital.
The inscription on the Dong &quot;gui&quot; celebrates a defeat inflicted by the Zhou on the Dongyi near Ying, a colony set up by one of King Cheng&#x27;s brothers to guard the southern approaches to the capital.

With the passing of generations, the family relationships between the king and the rulers of the colonies had also become more distant.
Instead, the Zhou state developed a bureaucracy and formalized relations between the elites.
There were reforms of the military, official titles and the distribution of land.
A drastic shift in the style and types of bronze ritual vessels, formerly based on Late Shang models, also suggests a change in ritual practice at this time.

Very little historical information is available for the reigns of the next four kings, Gong, Yih, Xiao and Yi.
Western Zhou kings were customarily succeeded by their oldest sons.
However, Sima Qian states, without explanation, that King Yih was succeeded by his uncle, who became King Xiao, and that on Xiao&#x27;s death &quot;the many lords restored&quot; King Yih&#x27;s son, King Yi.
Bronze inscriptions of the time use two different royal calendars, and the &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot; mentions King Yih moving out of the capital.
Some authors suggest that King Yih was forced out by his uncle, and the two were rivals for a time, but whatever happened is now obscure.
The succession was already presented as a linear sequence of kings in the Lai &quot;pan&quot;, cast in the reign of King Yi&#x27;s grandson.

Both Sima Qian and the &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot; state that King Yi boiled the Duke of Qi (in eastern Shandong) in a cauldron.
A bronze inscription confirms a Zhou attack on Qi at this time.
This incident, in a state originally founded by one of King Wu&#x27;s generals, indicates the waning authority of the Zhou king.
Soon afterwards, the Zhou were attacked by Chu, who reached as far as the Luo River before being driven off in a counterattack described in the Yu &quot;ding&quot; and Yu &quot;gui&quot;.

=== Late period ===

King Li embarked on defensive campaigns in the east and northwest.
The received texts all present him in a negative light, and record that he was driven out of the capital into exile in the Fen River valley.
Sources disagree on whether this was a revolt of the peasantry or the nobility, but agree that the king&#x27;s infant son was barely saved from a mob.
The &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot;, confirmed by bronze inscriptions, relate that control of the state passed to Lord He, instituting the Gonghe Regency.
Sima Qian&#x27;s belief that it was a co-regency was based on a misinterpretation of the name.

When King Li died in exile, his son became King Xuan.
Both received texts and bronze inscriptions suggest that King Xuan acted quickly to secure the state.
In his 5th year, he ordered a campaign against the Xianyun in the west, and then appointed the successful general to command the eastern territories.
According to the &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot;, in the following year he ordered a campaign against the Huaiyi.
Bronze inscriptions record victories in this campaign and others against the Xianyun.
He reinforced the south by relocating settlements from the Wei valley to the Nanyang basin and sought to inprove relations with distant Zhou states in the northeast and east.
At the same time, the king also had to contend with succession struggles in some of the old Zhou states.

According to received texts, King You&#x27;s reign began with ominous portents.
The texts, as well as some of the Minor Court Songs, hint at factional struggles within the Zhou court.
In his 11th year, the Quanrong attacked from the west, killing the king and causing the Zhou elite to flee from the Wei valley to the eastern capital, bringing the Western Zhou era to a close.
Although Zhou royal power had been declining for over a century, this dramatic event presents a convenient milestone for historians.
The Zhou would continue to occupy the eastern capital for another five centuries, but their sway over the states they had established became increasingly nominal.

<doc id="267848" wikidata="Q47075" url="?curid=267848" title="Scarface (1983 film)">
<text>Scarface is a 1983 American crime drama film directed by Brian De Palma, written by Oliver Stone and starring Al Pacino. It is a remake of the 1932 film, in turn based on the novel first published in 1930 by Armitage Trail. It tells the story of Cuban refugee Tony Montana (Pacino), who arrives in Miami during the Mariel boatlift and becomes a powerful drug lord. The film co-stars Steven Bauer, Michelle Pfeiffer, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Robert Loggia, Míriam Colón and F. Murray Abraham.

Pacino became interested in a remake of the 1932 version after seeing it, and he and producer Martin Bregman began to develop the feature project. Sidney Lumet was initially hired to direct the film but was replaced by De Palma, who hired Stone to write the script. De Palma dedicated this version of &quot;Scarface&quot; to the memories of Howard Hawks and Ben Hecht, the director and screenwriter, respectively, of the original film. Filming took place from November 1982 to May 1983 in Los Angeles and Miami. The film&#x27;s soundtrack is composed by Giorgio Moroder.

&quot;Scarface&quot; premiered in New York City on December 1, 1983, and was released on December 9 by Universal Pictures. The film grossed $45 million at the domestic box office and $66 million worldwide. Initial critical response was negative due to its extreme violence, profanity and graphic drug use. Some Cuban expatriates in Miami objected to the film&#x27;s portrayal of Cubans as criminals and drug traffickers. In the years that followed, some critics have reappraised it, considering it to be one of the greatest gangster films ever made. Screenwriters and directors such as Martin Scorsese have praised the film, and it has been referenced extensively in pop culture, especially in hip hop culture/gangsta rap, as well as comic books, television programs and video games. The film is regarded as a cult classic.

==Plot== 

In 1980, ex-convict Cuban refugee Tony Montana arrives in Miami as part of the Mariel boatlift with his friend Manny Ribera and their companions, Angel and Chi-Chi. Miami drug lord Frank Lopez arranges green cards for them in exchange for killing a former henchman for Fidel Castro. Dissatisfied with their jobs as restaurant dishwashers, Tony and Manny meet with Frank&#x27;s right-hand man, Omar Suarez, who sends the four to purchase cocaine from Colombian dealers. Tony and Angel are taken at gunpoint; Tony is made to watch as Angel is dismembered with a chainsaw, before Manny and Chi-Chi rescue them. They kill three of the dealers and deliver the drugs and money to Frank in person, suspecting Omar set them up.

Tony and Manny work for Frank while Tony is attracted to Frank&#x27;s wife, Elvira. Tony visits his mother, and sister Gina. Tony gives his mother $1,000, claiming he earns money as a political organizer. Tony&#x27;s mother sees through the lie and disowns him, but Gina keeps the money. Tony warns Manny to stay away from Gina. Frank sends Tony and Omar to Bolivia to meet cocaine kingpin Alejandro Sosa. Omar is angered when Tony seeks to negotiate a large deal without Frank&#x27;s approval. Sosa has his men hang Omar from a helicopter, telling Tony that Omar is a police informant and that Frank has poor judgment for trusting him. Tony says he never trusted Omar. Sosa agrees to the deal and warns Tony never to betray him.

Tony sets up his own cocaine operation. Mel Bernstein, a corrupt detective on Frank&#x27;s payroll, attempts to extort Tony for police protection. While at a club, Tony finds Gina having sex with a man in a bathroom and assaults them both, then escapes an attempt on his life by two hitmen. He confronts Frank and Bernstein over the attack, forcing Frank to confess that he set it up, then has Manny shoot Frank and kills Bernstein himself. Tony marries Elvira and becomes the distributor of Sosa&#x27;s product, constructing a large, heavily guarded estate to oversee his rapidly growing empire.

In 1983, Tony is caught in an FBI sting operation and charged with money laundering and tax evasion. Sosa offers to keep Tony out of prison via his government connections if Tony assists in the murder of a journalist about to expose Sosa. During a restaurant dinner, a drunken Tony blames Manny for his arrest and calls Elvira an infertile junkie, prompting Elvira to call out his criminality to the other patrons and leave him. Sosa&#x27;s henchman, &quot;Shadow&quot;, puts a radio-controlled bomb under the journalist&#x27;s car, but Tony tries to cancel the hit upon seeing the journalist accompanied by his wife and children. Shadow refuses and Tony kills him before he can detonate the bomb. Sosa vows revenge for Tony allowing the journalist to deliver the exposé.

At his mother&#x27;s behest, Tony, high on cocaine, tracks down Gina and finds her with Manny. Tony shoots Manny dead before learning Gina has just married him. Tony takes Gina to his estate and begins a cocaine binge in his office. As Sosa&#x27;s men invade the estate and begin killing the guards, Gina accuses Tony of wanting her for himself. She shoots and wounds him, and is then killed by one of Sosa&#x27;s men whom Tony kills in turn. Seeking vengeance, he opens fire on the group using an M16 rifle equipped with an M203 grenade launcher, killing many of them but sustaining multiple gunshot wounds. As he taunts his attackers, Sosa&#x27;s enforcer shoots him in the back and kills him. Tony&#x27;s body falls off the balcony and into a pool near the base of a statue displaying the motto &quot;The World Is Yours.&quot;

==Cast==


Other cast members include Ted Beniades as Seidelbaum, an undercover police officer; Geno Silva as &quot;The Skull&quot;, the assassin who kills Tony Montana, Richard Belzer as the Babylon Club M.C., Albert Carrier as Pedro Quinn, a sugar mogul working with Sosa; Victor Millan as Ariel Blayer, a Bolivian politician working with Sosa; Roberto Contreras as Emilio Rebenga, a Cuban emigre Montana assassinates; and Gregg Henry as Charles Goodson, an American associate of Sosa&#x27;s. Luis Guzman in one of his earliest roles plays one of Sosa&#x27;s henchmen during the shootout at Montana&#x27;s mansion.

De Palma regulars Charles Durning and Dennis Franz provided uncredited voiceover dubbing of the Immigration and Naturalization Service officers who interrogate Montana in the opening scene, played on-screen by Garnett Smith, Tony Perez and John Brandon. Lana Clarkson, Angela Aames, Ava Lazar, Margaret Michaels and Katt Shea appear as patrons at the Babylon Club. Teen model Tammy Lynn Leppert appears as a prostitute during the chainsaw scene. News reporter Mario Machado appears as himself.

==Production==
===Development===
&quot;Scarface&quot; began development after Al Pacino saw the 1932 film at the Tiffany Theater while in Los Angeles. He later called his manager, producer Martin Bregman, and informed him of his belief in the potential for a remake of that film. Pacino originally wanted to retain the period piece aspect, but realized that because of its melodramatic nature, it would be difficult to accomplish. Sidney Lumet became attached as the director, developing the idea for Montana to be a Cuban arriving in the United States during the Mariel boatlift.

Bregman and Lumet&#x27;s creative differences resulted in Lumet dropping out of the project. Lumet had wanted to make a more political story that focused on blaming the current presidential administration for the influx of cocaine into the United States, but Bregman disagreed. Bregman replaced him with Brian De Palma, and hired writer Oliver Stone; Stone had seen the original 1932 &quot;Scarface&quot; and had not enjoyed it, so he initially rejected the offer.

After he talked with Lumet, however, he was convinced to accept the offer because they agreed to transform the film from a period piece to a contemporary film. &quot;Sidney had a great idea to take the 1930s American prohibition gangster movie and make it into a modern immigrant gangster movie dealing with the same problems that we had then, that we&#x27;re prohibiting drugs instead of alcohol. There&#x27;s a prohibition against drugs that&#x27;s created the same criminal class prohibition of alcohol) created the Mafia&quot;. In the book &quot;The Oliver Stone Experience&quot;, Stone writes: &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to do an Italian Mafia movie ... We&#x27;d had dozens of these things. But then Bregman came to me and said, Sidney has a great idea — he wants to do it as a Marielito picture in Miami. I said, That&#x27;s interesting! Sidney&#x27;s idea was a good one.&quot;

Stone researched the script while battling his own cocaine addiction. He and Bregman performed their own research, traveling to Miami, Florida, where they were given access to records from the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office and the Organized Crime Bureau. Stone moved to Paris to write the script, believing that he could not break his addiction while in the United States, stating in a 2003 interview that he was completely off drugs at the time, &quot;because I don&#x27;t think cocaine helps writing. It&#x27;s very destructive to the brain cells.&quot;

Among other changes to the original story was the addition of the character Alejandro Sosa. Stone patterned the character after Roberto Suárez Gómez, a Bolivian drug lord nicknamed the &quot;King of Cocaine&quot;.

===Casting===

Pacino worked with experts in knife combat, trainers and boxer Roberto Durán to attain the body type that he wanted for the role. Durán also helped inspire the character, who had &quot;a certain lion in him&quot;, according to Pacino. Meryl Streep&#x27;s immigrant character in &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1982) also influenced Pacino&#x27;s portrayal of Tony Montana. Bauer and a dialect coach helped him learn aspects of the Cuban Spanish language and pronunciation.

Pfeiffer was an unknown actress at the time, known primarily for her role in &quot;Grease 2&quot;; both Pacino and De Palma had argued against her casting, but Bregman fought for her inclusion. Glenn Close was the original choice for the role, while others were also considered, including Geena Davis, Carrie Fisher, Kelly McGillis, Rosanna Arquette, Melanie Griffith, Kim Basinger, Brooke Shields, Sharon Stone and Sigourney Weaver.

Bauer got his role without auditioning. During the audition process, casting director Alixe Gordin saw Bauer and instantly noted that he was right for the role of Manny, a judgment with which both De Palma and Bregman agreed. He was the only actual Cuban in the principal cast. John Travolta was considered for the role.

===Filming===
The picture was shot over 24 weeks from November 22, 1982, to May 6, 1983. Although the film is set in Miami, the Miami Tourist Board declined requests to film there, fearing that the film&#x27;s themes of drugs and gangsters would deter tourism. Instead, much of the film was shot in Los Angeles. In April 1983, however, one scene was shot at Miami&#x27;s Fontainebleau Miami Beach. The chainsaw scene was filmed on Miami Beach&#x27;s Ocean Drive. A second unit team headed by David Hans Dreyfuss shot for one day at Coronado Beach in San Diego, California. Tony&#x27;s opulent mansion was El Fureidis, a Roman-styled mansion near Santa Barbara, California.

The production was halted twice for severe weather events in California. During production in March, Pacino burned his left hand on the muzzle of the gun that had been fired when he tripped during a fight scene. Production was shut down for more than a week while Pacino recovered. A premature bomb explosion also injured two stuntmen during a scene shot in his absence.

The gunfight scene at the end of the film includes a single camera shot directed by Steven Spielberg, who was visiting the set at the time. Powdered baby laxative was used as the fake substance for cocaine in the film. The special effects were performed by Ken Pepiot and Stan Parks.

According to De Palma, he arranged for Stone to leave the set because the latter was getting in the way of the former&#x27;s direction by &quot;talking to the actors on the set&quot;.

===Rating===
Less than two months before the film&#x27;s release, on October 28, 1983, &quot;Scarface&quot; was given an X rating by the MPAA for &quot;excessive and cumulative violence and for language&quot;.

De Palma had already re-cut the film three times by that point; De Palma stated: &quot;I said I&#x27;ve had it with these people, I&#x27;m not taking any more out.&quot; Bregman told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;we have been designated as a pornographic film ... We&#x27;ll accept the X rating and appeal&quot;. Universal would not release the film with an X rating due to the porn perception and the reduction of ticket sales being from ticket buyers, most newspapers, TV, and radio stations, who would not run ads for an X-rated film.

On November 8, an appeal board composed of 20 theater owners, studio executives and independent distributors overturned the decision 17 to 3 in favor of an R rating—more than the two-thirds required. De Palma believed that the changes were minor enough to be unnoticeable and requested that the original cut of the film be released with the rating. When the MPAA refused, De Palma released the film uncut anyway, admitting to it only months after the film&#x27;s release.

===Music===

Instead of using popular music from the period in which the film is set, the music in &quot;Scarface&quot; was produced by Academy Award-winning Italian record producer Giorgio Moroder. Reflecting Moroder&#x27;s style, the soundtrack consists mostly of synthesized new wave and electronic music. De Palma said that he repeatedly denied Universal&#x27;s requests to release the film with a &quot;pop&quot; score because he felt Moroder&#x27;s score was adequate. In June 2022, the complete score and soundtrack was released by La-La Land Records.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
&quot;Scarface&quot; premiered on December 1, 1983, in New York City, where it was initially greeted with mixed reaction. The film&#x27;s two stars, Al Pacino and Steven Bauer, were joined in attendance by Burt and Diane Lane, Melanie Griffith, Raquel Welch, Joan Collins, her boyfriend Peter Holm and Eddie Murphy, among others. It was given a wide release on December 9.

===Home media===
&quot;Scarface&quot; was initially released by MCA Home Video on VHS, CED Videodisc, LaserDisc and Beta in summer 1984—a two-tape set in 1.33:1 pan and scan ratio—and quickly became a bestseller, becoming the first to sell 100,000 copies at a retail price of $79.95.

A VHS formatted in the film&#x27;s theatrical 2.35:1 widescreen aspect ratio followed in 1998 to coincide with the special edition DVD release. The last VHS release was in 2003 to counterpart the 20th anniversary edition DVD. The 2003 DVD was remastered and re-released through Universal Records.

The commercial television version of &quot;Scarface&quot; premiered on ABC on January 7, 1989. 32 minutes of violence, profanity and sex were removed, as well as much of the dialogue, including the constant use of the word &quot;fuck&quot;, which was muted after the beginning of &quot;f-&quot; or replaced with less offensive alternatives.

The film received a North American DVD release on the film&#x27;s fifteenth anniversary in 1998 for the Signature Collection LaserDisc release of the film, but recycled onto DVD, featuring a non-anamorphic widescreen transfer, a &quot;Making of&quot; documentary, outtakes, trailers, a photo gallery, production notes, and cast and crew biographies. This release was not successful, and many fans and reviewers complained about its unwatchable video transfer and muddled sound, describing it as &quot;one of the worst big studio releases out there&quot;. The 20th Anniversary edition was released on DVD and VHS in 2003, with the DVD selling more than units in its first week and becoming the best-selling R-rated DVD title.

In 2003, &quot;Music Inspired by Scarface&quot;, a Def Jam Recordings compilation album, featured songs by various hip-hop artists which either draw direct inspiration from the film, or contain subject matter that can relate to the film.

&quot;Scarface&quot; was released on Blu-ray on September 6, 2011, in a two-disc, limited edition, steelbox package. The set was criticized for its poor picture quality due to usage of an old master created from the DVD release. Disc two is a DVD of the 1932 &quot;Scarface&quot;, featuring a TCM-produced introduction by Robert Osborne and an alternate ending. Bonus features include &quot;The Making of Scarface&quot; documentary, and a new retrospective documentary: &quot;The Scarface Phenomenon&quot;.

A special gift set, limited to 1,000 copies, features the Blu-ray set housed in a cigar humidor, designed by humidor craftsman Daniel Marshall. The humidor box set retailed at $999.99.

A standard 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray and limited edition set were released on October 15, 2019. The limited edition set contains a specially-made statue, a newly remastered transfer and, for the first time on Blu-ray, the 1932 original. There is also a standard set that contains the same 4K transfer and a remastered 1080p disk but does not include the 1932 version. A month later on November 19, the 1932 original was given its own individual release. The 4K release ports over all of the old special features and adds one new one, which is a reunion special in tribute to the 35th anniversary of the movie&#x27;s release.

In the United States, the film sold DVD units for in 2003, and 285,916 Blu-ray units for $6,103,545 , totaling DVD and Blu-ray units sold for .

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Scarface&quot; was released theatrically in North America on December 9, 1983. The film earned $4.5 million from 996 theaters during its opening weekend, an average of $4,616 per theater, and ranking as the second-highest-grossing film of the weekend behind &quot;Sudden Impact&quot; ($9.6 million), which debuted the same weekend. It went on to earn $44.6 million in North America and $20.4 million from other markets, for a total of $65.1 million.

This figure made &quot;Scarface&quot; the 16th highest-grossing film of 1983, and seventh highest grossing R-rated film in North America for 1983. It has since been given three re-releases in 2003, which featured a remastered film for the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary, 2012 and 2014, bringing the total earned to $45.4 million domestically, for a total of $66 million worldwide.

In terms of box-office admissions, the film sold 14,197,700 tickets in the United States and Spain, 1,067,544 tickets in France and Italy, 250,746 tickets in South Korea, and 195,872 tickets in Germany, for a total of tickets sold in these territories.

===Critical response===
Critics were generally negative about &quot;Scarface&quot; when it was originally released. The film was noted for its violence and profanity. &quot;New York&quot; magazine called it an empty, bullying, overblown B-movie.

Writers Kurt Vonnegut and John Irving both stated that they walked out after the chainsaw scene.

At the middle of the film, Martin Scorsese reportedly said to Bauer, &quot;You guys are great – but be prepared, because they&#x27;re going to hate it in Hollywood ... because it&#x27;s about them.&quot;

In his review for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, David Ansen wrote, &quot;If &quot;Scarface&quot; makes you shudder, it&#x27;s from what you &quot;think&quot; you see and from the accumulated tension of this feral landscape. It&#x27;s a grand, shallow, decadent entertainment, which like all good Hollywood gangster movies delivers the punch and counterpunch of glamour and disgust.&quot;

Jay Scott wrote in his review for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, &quot;For a while, Al Pacino is hypnotic as Montana. But the effort expended on the flawless Cuban accent and the attempts to flesh out a character cut from inch-thick cardboard are hopeless.&quot;

In his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Gary Arnold wrote, &quot;A movie that appeared intent on revealing an alarmingly contemporary criminal subculture gradually reverts to underworld cliche, covering its derivative tracks with outrageous decor and an apocalyptic, production number finale, ingeniously choreographed to leave the antihero floating face down in a literal bloodbath.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; rated it four stars out of four in his 1983 review, and later added it to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list. Ebert wrote, &quot;DePalma and his writer, Oliver Stone, have created a gallery of specific individuals, and one of the fascinations of the movie is that we aren&#x27;t watching crime-movie clichés, we&#x27;re watching people who are criminals.&quot;

Vincent Canby praised the film in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The dominant mood of the film is... bleak and futile: what goes up must always come down. When it comes down in &quot;Scarface&quot;, the crash is as terrifying as it is vivid and arresting.&quot;

Leonard Maltin was among the critics who held a negative opinion of &quot;Scarface&quot;. He gave the film 1½ stars out of four, stating that &quot;Scarface&quot; &quot;wallows in excess and unpleasantness for nearly &quot;three hours&quot;, and offers no new insights except that crime doesn&#x27;t pay. At least the 1932 movie &quot;moved&quot;.&quot; Maltin included an addendum to his review in later editions of his annual movie guide, stating his surprise with the film&#x27;s newfound popularity as a cult classic.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 79% approval rating, based on 77 reviews, with an average rating of 7.50/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Director Brian De Palma and star Al Pacino take it to the limit in this stylized, ultra-violent and eminently quotable gangster epic that walks a thin white line between moral drama and celebratory excess.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 65 out of 100, based on reviews from 9 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews.

===Depiction of stereotypes===
During filming, some Cubans objected to the film&#x27;s Cuban characters being portrayed as criminals by mostly non-Cuban actors. The film features a disclaimer following its credits, stating in red, all-cap lettering, &quot;&quot;Scarface&quot; is a fictional account of the activities of a small group of ruthless criminals. The characters do not represent the Cuban/American community and it would be erroneous and unfair to suggest that they do. The vast majority of Cuban/Americans have demonstrated a dedication, vitality and enterprise that has enriched the American scene.&quot;

In 2008, Damarys Ocaña of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that the film reinforces stereotypes of Marielito Cubans, as it exaggerates the number of criminals in the Mariel boatlift. She also called Pacino&#x27;s portrayal of a Cuban-American as having a &quot;ridiculous accent and overacting&quot;. According to a 1985 &quot;Sun Sentinel&quot; magazine article, it was rumored that, of the approximate 125,000 refugees that entered the United States on the boatlift, around 16,000 to 20,000 were estimated to be criminals, and around 350 to 400 Mariel Cubans were reported to inhabit Dade County jails on a typical day. However, in a &quot;New York Daily News&quot; editorial following the film&#x27;s release, Miguel Perez charged, &quot;The movie fails to say that even among those Marielitos who had criminal records, there were thousands whose offenses were so minor that they would not be considered criminals here, and thousands of others whose &#x27;criminal record&#x27; was based on their opposition to the Communist regime.&quot;

Demetrio Perez, the city commissioner of Miami, led the charge against the film. Estimates assert that the Cuban refugees included only some of the 2,700 hardened criminals. In &quot;The Oliver Stone Experience&quot;, Stone commented, &quot;Well, Tony Montana was a gangster ... His mother and his sister represent the clean-cut Cuban community. His mother scolds him: &quot;You&#x27;re a scumbag, get out of my house! You&#x27;re ruining your sister!&quot; So there is a strong morality in the movie. I knew about the criticisms even in advance, that Cubans were not like that. But I&#x27;m sorry: A lot of Cubans &quot;did&quot; become Marielitos. If I&#x27;d done it about Colombians, they would&#x27;ve said the same thing: &#x27;You&#x27;re anti-Colombian&#x27;.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2003: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains:
** Tony Montana – Nominated Villain
* 2005: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes:
** Tony Montana: &quot;Say &quot;hello&quot; to my little friend!&quot; – #61
* 2008: AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10:
** No. 10 Gangster Film

Notably, &quot;Scarface&quot; is the only remake to appear in the same AFI 10 Top 10 list as the original film. It is No. 10 while the 1932 original is No. 6.

==Legacy==
===Film industry===
Pacino was already an established successful actor, but &quot;Scarface&quot; helped launch Pfeiffer&#x27;s and Mastrantonio&#x27;s careers; both were relatively unknown before, but went on to individual successes. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked the film #8 on their list of &quot;The Top 50 Cult Films&quot;, and &quot;Empire&quot; magazine placed it among the top 500 films of all time, at #284. In 2009, &quot;Total Film&quot; listed it at number 9 on their list of the 30 Greatest Gangster movies. &quot;Scarface&quot; was among the earliest films in which the expletive &quot;fuck&quot; is used persistently; 226 times total. The company set up by former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein to launder money was named Montana Management after Tony Montana&#x27;s money-laundering operation in the film.

===Relatability to mobsters===
During a 2012 police raid of Italian Mafia gangster Carlo Padovani&#x27;s Naples home, a life-sized porcelain bust of Tony Montana was found. Leading figures in the Italian Mafia were said to admire the &quot;Scarface&quot; movie and Tony Montana, further confirming that the film depicts the life of real drug lords. Another Naples drug lord, Walter Schiavone, instructed to have an exact replica of Tony Montana&#x27;s Miami mansion built in Naples, Italy.

===Influence in hip hop===
The release of &quot;Scarface&quot; coincided with the rise of hip hop, and the film has had a lasting influence on hip hop music artists. American rapper Nas compared himself to Tony Montana and compared rapper Jay-Z to Manolo, both characters from &quot;Scarface&quot;, on Nas&#x27;s track &quot;Last Real Nigga Alive&quot; from his album &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot;, during the time of the high-profile feud between the two. Rapper AZ, Nas&#x27;s close associate has referred himself as SOSA over the years. In 2003, Hip Hop record label Def Jam Recordings released a compilation album called &quot;Music Inspired by Scarface&quot;. The compilation album contains Rap music directly inspired by the movie or has lyrical content that can relate to the film. 

Rapper Chief Keef uses the nickname &quot;Sosa&quot; after Alejandro Sosa. South-Korean rapper and member of group BTS, Agust D also compared himself to Tony Montana and made multiple references to the movie in his track &quot;Tony Montana&quot; from his debut album, &quot;Agust D&quot;. In The Lonely Island parody hip hop 2011 song &quot;Jack Sparrow&quot;, a rap song intended to be about clubbing is ruined by Michael Bolton singing about various films, including &quot;Scarface&quot;.

In 2011, Rapper Future released the gold-certified &quot;Tony Montana&quot;. The beginning of the music video for the song &quot;2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted&quot; by rapper 2Pac featuring Snoop Dogg is a reference to a scene from the movie. Rapper Tony Yayo&#x27;s stage name is derived from the movie, referencing Tony Montana&#x27;s first name and a moment in the movie where Tony tells Chi-Chi to &quot;get the yeyo&quot;. In 2023, Drake sampled a monologue by Pacino in the film and included it on the song Daylight.

===Cultural references===

In 2010, artist James Georgopoulos included the screen-used guns from Scarface in his popular &quot;Guns of Cinema&quot; series. Dark Horse Comics&#x27; imprint DH Press released a novel called &quot;Scarface: The Beginning&quot; by L. A. Banks. IDW publishing released a five-issue limited series called &quot;Scarface: Scarred For Life&quot; from December 2006 to April 2007. It starts with corrupt police officers finding that Tony has survived the final mansion showdown. Tony works at rebuilding his criminal empire, similar to the game &quot;The World Is Yours&quot;. IDW published a four-issue prequel series called &quot;Scarface: Devil in Disguise&quot; from July to October 2007. It follows Tony as he grows up on the crime-filled streets of a Castro-controlled Cuba, ultimately molding himself into the potential Miami-based gangster seen in the movie.

&quot;Scarface&quot; is among the films that served as inspiration for the 2002 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;, which took place in a representation of 1980s&#x27; Miami and featured a recreation of Montana&#x27;s mansion. The video for Mötley Crüe&#x27;s song &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; echoes several elements of the film (the end of the video features a bloodless version of the climatic shootout where Tony Montana is killed) and the song itself describes a young man who rises to great power in the drug trade and then loses it all.

The video game series Yakuza takes many influences from the film. Among these include Kiryu Kazuma&#x27;s various outfits which bear similarities to those worn by Tony Montana.

&quot;Scarface&quot; got its own direct tie-in with the 2006 video games &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;

The quote, &quot;Say hello to my little friend!&quot;, from the film&#x27;s climactic scene has become a pop-culture staple, and ranked 61 in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes list.

In 1992, professional wrestler Scott Hall joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) as Razor Ramon, a shady and stylish Cuban American bully from Miami. The character was modeled on the characters Tony Montana and Manny Ribera from &quot;Scarface&quot;. Ramon&#x27;s nickname (The Bad Guy) and catchphrase (&quot;Say hello to The Bad Guy&quot;) derive from Montana&#x27;s quotes: &quot;Say hello to my little friend&quot; and &quot;Say goodnight to the bad guy&quot;. Later in his career, Hall claimed that he pitched the idea of a &quot;Scarface&quot;-like character during a meeting with Vince McMahon and Pat Patterson as a joke.

Bob Dylan&#x27;s 2020 song &quot;My Own Version of You&quot; references it with the line, &quot;I&#x27;ll take the Scarface Pacino and the Godfather Brando / Mix &#x27;em up in a tank and get a robot commando.&quot;

Metric&#x27;s 2009 song &quot;Gold Guns Girls&quot; from the album &quot;Fantasies&quot; was inspired by the film.

A 3D recreation of Tony&#x27;s mansion was featured in the November 9, 2006 episode of &quot;MTV Cribs&quot; as a marketing piece by Vivendi (before being acquired by Activision) for the release of the video game of the same name. The episode features 3D model of Tony (voiced by André Sogliuzzo) leading a cameraman throughout his mansion, giving an in-depth tour of each room in a 3D environment. Tony&#x27;s mansion is modeled after the same one appearing in the film and is used in game.

In the cartoon series &quot;The Batman&quot;, the character of the Ventriloquist uses a dummy wearing an outfit modeled on Montana&#x27;s.

==Canceled sequel==
In 2001, plans were made for hip hop artist Cuban Link to write and star in a sequel of &quot;Scarface&quot; titled &quot;Son of Tony&quot;. The plans drew both praise and criticism and, after several years, Cuban Link indicated that he may no longer be involved with the project as the result of film rights issues and creative control.

==Proposed remake==
In 2011, Universal began developing a new version of &quot;Scarface&quot;. The studio stated that the new film is neither a sequel nor a remake, but will take elements from both this version and its 1932 predecessor, including the basic premise: a man who becomes a kingpin in his quest for the American Dream. Bregman, who produced the 1983 remake, was set to produce this version also, with a screenplay by David Ayer, and David Yates in talks to direct the film.

In March 2014, &quot;TheWrap&quot; reported that Pablo Larraín was in negotiations to direct the film, along with Paul Attanasio to write the script. The film&#x27;s update was going to be an original story set in modern-day Los Angeles that follows a Mexican immigrant&#x27;s rise in the criminal underworld as he strives for the American Dream. Jonathan Herman was set in March 2015 to rewrite both drafts of the script.

Antoine Fuqua was hired to direct the film in August 2016, with Terence Winter to pen the script for the film. In January 2017, Fuqua left the project, and Diego Luna was cast in the lead role.

The film was initially scheduled to be released in theaters on August 10, 2018, with the film&#x27;s script written by the Coen brothers. Fuqua was brought back to direct the new film, with Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer rewriting the screenplay. 

Fuqua again departed the project in May 2020. Instead, Luca Guadagnino signed to direct the film, with the script again confirmed to be by the Coen brothers.

As of 2022, the status of the film has reached a standstill; Guadagnino has not announced whether he is still involved.

<doc id="267852" wikidata="Q126902242" url="?curid=267852" title="Berberis aquifolium">
<text>Berberis aquifolium, the Oregon grape or holly-leaved barberry, is a North American species of flowering plant in the family Berberidaceae. It is an evergreen shrub growing up to tall and wide, with pinnate leaves consisting of spiny leaflets, and dense clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, followed by dark bluish-black berries.

The berries are a part of the traditional diet of some indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest and the species serves as the state flower of Oregon.

==Description==

&quot;Berberis aquifolium&quot; grows to tall by wide. The stems and twigs have a thickened, corky appearance. The leaves are pinnate and up to long, comprising spiny leaflets. The leathery leaves resemble those of holly. The yellow flowers are borne in dense clusters long in late spring. Each of the six stamens terminates in two spreading branches. The six yellow petals are enclosed by six yellow sepals. At the base of the flower are three greenish-yellow bracts, less than half as long as the sepals. The spherical berries are up to wide, dark dusty-blue, and tart in taste.

===Chemistry===
&quot;Berberis aquifolium&quot; contains 5&#x27;-methoxyhydnocarpin (5&#x27;-MHC), a multidrug resistance pump inhibitor, which works to decrease bacterial resistance &quot;in vitro&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
Some botanists continue to place part of the barberry genus &quot;Berberis&quot; in a separate genus, &quot;Mahonia&quot;. Under this classification &quot;Berberis aquifolium&quot; is named &quot;Mahonia aquifolium&quot;. As of 2023 Plants of the World Online (POWO) classifies it as &quot;Berberis aquifolium&quot; with no valid subspecies.

&quot;Berberis dictyota&quot; is considered a variety.

===Etymology===
The Latin specific epithet &quot;aquifolium&quot; denotes &quot;sharp-leafed&quot; (as in &quot;Ilex aquifolium&quot;, the common holly), referring to the spiny foliage.

&quot;Berberis aquifolium&quot; is not closely related to either the true holly (&quot;Ilex aquifolium&quot;) or the true grape (&quot;Vitis&quot;), but its common name, &quot;Oregon-grape holly&quot; comes from its resemblance to these plants.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Berberis aquifolium&quot; is a native plant in the North American West from Southeast Alaska to Northern California to central New Mexico, often occurring in the understory of Douglas-fir forests (although other forest types contain the species) and in brushlands in the Cascades, Rockies, and northern Sierra Nevada.

==Ecology==
As with some other &quot;Berberis&quot;, &quot;B. aquifolium&quot; can serve as an alternate host for wheat yellow rust (&quot;Puccinia striiformis&quot; f. sp. &quot;tritici&quot;, which usually prefers wheat), but it is unknown whether this occurs naturally.

In some areas outside of its native range, &quot;B. aquifolium&quot; has been classified as an invasive exotic species that may displace native vegetation.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Berberis aquifolium&quot; is a popular subject in shady or woodland plantings. It is valued for its striking foliage and flowers, which often appear before those of other shrubs. It is resistant to summer drought, tolerates poor soils, and does not create excessive leaf litter. Its berries attract birds.

Numerous cultivars and hybrids have been developed, of which the following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:
* &quot;M.&quot; × &quot;wagneri&quot; &#x27;Pinnacle&#x27; (&quot;B. aquifolium&quot; × &quot;Berberis pinnata&quot;)
* &#x27;Apollo&#x27;

==Uses==

The small purplish-black fruits, which are quite tart and contain large seeds, are edible raw after the season&#x27;s first frosts. They were included in small quantities in the traditional diets of Pacific Northwest tribes, mixed with salal or another sweeter fruit. Today, they are sometimes used to make jelly, alone or mixed with salal. Oregon-grape juice can be fermented to make wine, similar to European barberry wine folk traditions, although it requires an unusually high amount of sugar.

The inner bark of the larger stems and roots of Oregon grape yield a yellow dye. The berries contain a dye that can be purple, blue, pink, or green depending on the pH of water used to make the dye, due to the berries containing a naturally occurring pH indicator.

===Medicinal uses===
Some Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau use Oregon grape for indigestion.

The plant contains berberine and reportedly has antimicrobial properties similar to those of goldenseal.

==In culture==
In 1899, Oregon-grape was recognized as the state flower of Oregon.

<doc id="267865" wikidata="Q787782" url="?curid=267865" title="Rhode Island T. F. Green International Airport">
<text>Rhode Island T. F. Green International Airport is a public international airport in Warwick, Rhode Island, United States, south of the state&#x27;s capital and largest city of Providence. Opened in 1931, the airport was named for former Rhode Island governor and longtime senator Theodore Francis Green. Rebuilt in 1996, the renovated main terminal was named for former Rhode Island governor Bruce Sundlun. It is the first state-owned airport in the United States.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2023–2027 categorized it as a small-hub primary commercial service facility.

PVD covers an area of 1,111 acres (450 ha) and has two runways.

T. F. Green Airport is a regional airport serving the FAA&#x27;s New England Region in the FAA System Plan. The airport is the largest and most active airport among the six operated by the Rhode Island Airport Corporation (RIAC). It is estimated the T.F. Green aerodrome has a potential serviceable market of some 7.5 million persons living within roughly 90-minutes of the airport.

==History==
T. F. Green Airport was dedicated on September 27, 1931, as Hillsgrove State Airport, drawing what was at that time the largest crowd to attend a public function in the country. In 1933, the Rhode Island State Airport Terminal was built on Airport Road, then called Occupasstuxet Road. In 1938, the airport was renamed in honor of Green, who had just been elected to the Senate two years earlier. At the time it had three concrete runways. The Army Air Force took control from 1942 to 1945, using it for flight training. The 435th Army Air Force Base Unit was located at the airfield.

A September 1946 diagram shows runways 5, 10 and 16 all long; in April 1951 runway 5 was and 5R/23L was under construction. A few years later 5R/23L was , which it remained until extended to around 1967. The April 1957 OAG shows 26 weekday departures: 11 Eastern, 10 American, four United, and one National. Nonstops did not reach beyond Boston and Newark until 1959 when Eastern started a DC-7B nonstop to Washington, which was the longest until United started Cleveland in 1968 and Chicago in 1970 and Eastern started Miami in 1969 and Atlanta in 1970. The first jets were Mohawk BAC-111s in 1966.

President Richard Nixon made a campaign stop at the airport on the night of Friday, November 3, 1972. A crowd of 10,000 watched as Nixon, standing on the steps of Air Force One, urged voters to support Republican candidates Herbert F. DeSimone for Governor and John Chafee for U.S. Senator. (Both lost, though Chafee later won the office in 1976.) Air Force One again touched down at T. F. Green on August 30, 1975, this time carrying President Gerald Ford, en route to a fundraiser in Newport. He was greeted by a crowd of about 1,500 supporters, as well as local politicians including Governor Philip W. Noel, Senator John O. Pastore, and Providence Mayor Buddy Cianci. 
As part of a 2001 Master Plan, the FAA&#x27;s Runway runway incursion action team (visiting in 2000) made a few recommendations including the closing of runway 5L/23R and converting it into a taxiway. Reported runway distances as part of the same study 


===From the 1960s===
To enhance itself as the lone airport for a metro area of over 1.6 million people, a new terminal was built on Post Road in 1964, replacing the old 1933 terminal along Airport Road. In 1996 this terminal was replaced, expanding to 18 gates, and adding a lower arrival level and an upper departure level. In 1997 four gates were added. Airlines added flights to T. F. Green Airport, including Air Canada, Southwest, SATA International (which operated flights to the Azores using an A310-300), and Spirit Airlines.

After the September 11 attacks in 2001, T. F. Green Airport, like most airports in the United States, faced a temporary decrease in passengers and fewer flights from American Airlines (which once flew to Chicago O&#x27;Hare and Dallas/Fort Worth Airport), Spirit, and SATA. The decrease in service was especially severe to Chicago O&#x27;Hare as between both United and American decreased the number of one-way daily seats from nearly a combined 1,400 to today&#x27;s 225 daily one-way seats. Nine flights of 727, 737, 757 and MD-80 service downgraded to today&#x27;s regional jet use. Since the HNTB-designed Bruce Sundlun Terminal opened in 1996, T. F. Green became more congested due to increased traffic and post-9/11 security changes. Renovations followed, including expansion of baggage rooms to accommodate a new In-Line Explosive Detection System (EDS) Baggage Handling System, expanded security screening checkpoints, more concessions and ticket counters, and expansion of RIAC offices on the second and third floors.

Traffic increased to a high of 5.7 million passengers in 2005, while at the same time Boston Logan was handling 25 million passengers. After 2005, airlines started consolidating service at larger airports by withdrawing service and reducing frequencies at mid-sized hubs and small-sized hubs. Airports such as T. F. Green, Jacksonville, Bradley, etc. were affected. The recession and Boston Logan&#x27;s proximity to the Providence metro area also took its toll on T. F. Green as numbers decreased to 3.5 million in 2015. In 2017 passenger figures grew to just shy of 4 million passengers. With the addition of Amazon Air, which includes its own Prime Jets plus DHL and Atlas Air Jets, cargo numbers increased to nearly 44 million pounds. Amazon moved their cargo service from T. F. Green to Bradley International Airport on August 1, 2018.

In 2017 the airport had 74,561 aircraft operations, average 204 per day: 50% scheduled commercial, 14% air taxi, 35% general aviation and &lt;1% military. 33 aircraft were then based at this airport: 55% single-engine, 9% multi-engine, 30% jet and 6% helicopter. In 2017 T. F. Green handled about 3.937 million passengers. The mainline airline with the largest presence at T. F. Green is Southwest, which carried 45.07% of all passengers in 2017, followed by American with 13.65%. T. F. Green also handled over of cargo and mail in 2017.

T. F. Green was visited by Air Force One on October 25, 2010, a Concorde operated by British Airways on June 13, 1988, and an Airbus A340 flown by Iberia Airlines on June 1, 2011, which transported the Men&#x27;s Spanish national soccer team for their match against the U.S. National Team on June 4, 2011, at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts. T. F. Green was visited by Air Force One again on October 31, 2014, carrying President Barack Obama.

From 1998 until 2013, T. F. Green had regular service to Toronto Pearson International Airport first via Air Jazz and then by Air Georgian after 9/11, both did business as express carriers for Air Canada. In the early 1990s Leisure Air provided twice weekly seasonal service to Bermuda. Charters such as North American Air and Buffalo Air handled scheduled charter service to the Azores from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s. SATA International, now known as Azores Airlines, has recently resumed seasonal service to the Azores, having previously offered service until 2010. In 2015, service was announced to Frankfurt, Germany by Condor and Praia, in the Cape Verde islands, by TACV. The Condor service to Frankfurt marked the first non-stop route to mainland Europe from Providence; however, the flight was later suspended for unspecified reasons. February 6, 2017, &quot;USA Today&quot; announced that Norwegian Air had selected Providence&#x27;s T. F. Green Airport as its base for flights to Europe. Norwegian Air Shuttle operated from Providence using new Boeing 737 MAX planes for its service to cities in Western Europe, however as of now the service is cut due to the groundings of the aircraft related to its MCAS system. The official announcements were made February 23, 2017, with flights starting to Belfast, Cork, Dublin, Edinburgh and Shannon. Later, flights were added to Bergen in Norway, Pointe-à-Pitre in Guadeloupe, and Fort-de-France in Martinique. These routes were gradually dropped due to poor load factors, and the Boeing 737 MAX grounding. Norwegian&#x27;s last flight from Providence operated on September 15, 2019.

On October 1, 2017, T. F. Green&#x27;s runway 5/23 was officially opened for use at its new expanded length of 8,700 feet. Planning on the project began in the 1990s, and work on the expansion began in 2013. The project included demolition of an existing neighborhood, removal of nearby utility poles and trees to clear approach lanes, and moving city park from one side of the airport to the other. Officials were hopeful that a longer runway would attract more longer-range nonstop flights, such as the international routes that Norwegian Air began flying in 2017, as well as enhance safety for short-distance flights, giving pilots more runway to use in the case of poor weather conditions. The runway expansion was desired because, as the Rhode Island Airport Corporation (RIAC) wrote in 2001, the master plan completed in 1997 failed to envision the &quot;tremendous growth&quot; that T. F. Green experienced. The report identified the lack of runway length as a hindrance to &quot;range and diversity of service&quot;, in particular emphasizing ability to reach non-hub cities, the west coast, and international locations. Challenges for T. F. Green in expanding the runway were the residential and commercial developments around it. Many residents opposed the expansion.

In 2017, T. F. Green was named the official airport of the New England Patriots.

===Name change===

In February 2018, the Rhode Island Airport Corporation (RIAC) formally petitioned the state legislature to change the name of the airport to &quot;Rhode Island International Airport&quot;. RIAC believed the name change would both reflect the airport&#x27;s international flight presence and better describe the location it serves. A bill introduced that month, H7673A, was not adopted.

In 2021, revised proposal H6051, which would change the airport&#x27;s name to &quot;Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport&quot;, was passed by the Rhode Island House of Representatives on May 11. The proposal was approved by the Rhode Island Senate the following month. In June 2021, the airport&#x27;s name was officially changed. In April 2024, two ten-foot tall signs were installed along Interstate 95 with the new name.

==Facilities==
===Terminal===

The airport&#x27;s terminal, named for former Rhode Island governor Bruce Sundlun, has two concourses, North and South. The South Concourse has eight gates and the North Concourse has 14 gates. Seven and Eight are designed for international arrivals and are directly connected to customs, which is on the lower level of the concourse. The terminal contains stores, restaurants, and a central food court.

=== Ground transportation ===
The airport is located directly adjacent to the Northeast Corridor, and includes a station served by the MBTA commuter rail on the Providence/Stoughton Line. The station was constructed in October 2010 and opened in November 2011, and includes an elevated walkway to the terminal, a rental car garage, and a large parking area. Upon opening in December 2010, the station saw limited service to Providence and Boston. In 2011, train service was expanded to 10 daily round trips, and in 2012 service was extended south when Wickford Junction opened. Travel time to South Station in Boston is about 85 minutes, while the travel times to both Providence and to Wickford Junction are about 15 minutes. Amtrak does not stop at the station; however, the state has long-studied the feasibility of a stop and is currently conducting a preliminary engineering study.

T. F. Green Airport has direct access to I-95 via the T. F. Green Airport Connector Road, a freeway. The airport is served by major car rental companies as well as by local taxi and limousine services.

The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) offers public bus transportation to and from the cities of Providence (Kennedy Plaza in downtown Providence) and Newport.

==Accidents and incidents==
===1999 runway incursion===
On December 6, 1999, at approximately , a runway incursion occurred involving United Airlines Flight 1448 (a Boeing 757) and FedEx Express Flight 1662 (a Boeing 727) on Runway 5R/23L. Shortly after landing on Runway 5R, United 1448 was instructed by the air traffic control tower to taxi to the gate, part of the instructions including crossing Runway 16. Due to the low-visibility conditions that night, the pilots became disoriented and turned down the wrong taxiway, which led them back towards the active runway they had just arrived on. The tower controller, unaware of United&#x27;s mistake, cleared FedEx 1662 for takeoff on Runway 5R. United 1448 then confirmed with the controller that they should cross the runway in front of them. Neither party was aware that they were actually at the intersection of Runway 16 and 5R/23L instead of Runway 16 and 5L/23R. The aircraft proceeded to move towards Runway 5R/23L.

United 1448, sounding confused, then radioed that they were near taxiway Kilo, and as they re-entered Runway 5R/23L, reported that &quot;somebody just took off&quot; overhead, referring to FedEx 1662 that had indeed just become airborne in very close proximity to the United aircraft. However, the controller appeared not to take this seriously, stating, &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t be anywhere near Kilo&quot;, and advised the United 1448 crew to hold position. United 1448 informed the tower that they were now on an active runway, which they mistakenly believed to be 23R/5L (inactive at the time). A moment later the pilot corrected himself, stating that they were on 5R/23L. United 1448&#x27;s crew was told again to stand by, so the aircraft remained idle at the intersection of the active runway, while the controller cleared MetroJet 2998 for takeoff on the same runway. The United 1448 pilot immediately interjected to insist that the plane was on the active runway, which the controller denied, saying it was not an active runway. Meanwhile, the MetroJet pilot, having heard the exchange, realized there was confusion over the whereabouts of United 1448 and refused the takeoff clearance, stating, &quot;We&#x27;re staying clear of all runways until we figure this out.&quot;

Despite all this confusion, the controller again cleared MetroJet 2998 for takeoff on Runway 5R. They again refused to accept the clearance for take-off until the United 1448 was confirmed to have arrived at the gate. Once United 1448 was confirmed to be at the gate, MetroJet 2998 finally departed on Runway 5R.

The US Airways crew operating MetroJet Flight 2998 were praised by a US Air spokesperson for their actions of avoiding a disaster. An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board followed and while no fault was assigned to the controller, she was required to undergo retraining before returning to service. The pilots were debriefed by United, received additional training and were returned to service.

Part of the confusion was due to United 1448&#x27;s inability to correctly identify the runway they were on. During the radio exchanges, United 1448 refers to 23L/5R as 23R/5L and vice versa. Runway 23R/5L has been closed since this incident and is now taxiway Victor.

===2007 CRJ accident===
On December 16, 2007, Air Wisconsin (US Airways Express) flight 3758, a CRJ-200 arriving from Philadelphia, departed the left side of runway 5 after a hard landing by an unstabilized approach. Although the aircraft sustained substantial damage, none of the 31 passengers and crew aboard were injured. The aircraft was repaired and placed back into service.

<text>Project Genie was a computer research project started in 1964 at the University of California, Berkeley. 
It produced an early time-sharing system including the Berkeley Timesharing System, which was then commercialized as the SDS 940.

==History==
Project Genie was funded by J. C. R. Licklider, the head of ARPA&#x27;s Information Processing Techniques Office at that time. The project was a smaller counterpart to MIT&#x27;s Project MAC.

The Scientific Data Systems SDS 940 was created by modifying an SDS 930 24-bit commercial computer so that it could be used for timesharing. The work was funded by ARPA and directed by Melvin W. Pirtle and Wayne Lichtenberger at UC Berkeley. Butler Lampson, Chuck Thacker, and L. Peter Deutsch were among the young technical leaders of that project. When completed and in service, the first 940 ran reliably in spite of its array of tricky mechanical issues such as a huge disk drive driven by hydraulic arms. It served about forty or fifty users at a time and still managed to drive a graphics subsystem that was quite capable for its time. 

When SDS realized the value of the time sharing system, and that the software was in the public domain (funded by the US federal government), they came back to Berkeley and collected enough information to begin manufacturing. Because SDS manufacturing was overloaded with the 9 series production and the startup of the Sigma Series production, it could not incorporate the 940 modifications into the standard production line. Instead, production of the 940s was turned over to the Systems Engineering Department, which manufactured systems customised to user requirements. To produce a 940, the Systems Engineering Department ordered a 930 from SDS manufacturing, installed the modifications developed by the Berkeley engineers, and shipped machine to the SDS customer as a 940.

Project Genie pioneered several computer hardware techniques, such as commercial time-sharing which allowed end-user programming in machine language, separate protected user modes, memory paging, and protected memory. Concepts from Project Genie influenced the development of the TENEX operating system for the PDP-10, and Unix, which inherited the concept of process forking from it (Unix co-creator Ken Thompson worked on an SDS 940 while at Berkeley). An SDS 940 mainframe was used by Douglas Engelbart&#x27;s OnLine System at the Stanford Research Institute and was the first computer used by the Community Memory Project at Berkeley.

In 1968, Lampson also helped design a different timesharing system at Berkeley: Cal TSS for the CDC 6400 with Extended Core Storage. Lampson was only involved until 1969, but Cal TSS continued until 1971.
Several members of project Genie such as Pirtle, Thacker, Deutsch and Lampson left UCB to form the Berkeley Computer Corporation (BCC), which produced one prototype, the BCC-500.
After BCC went bankrupt after its funding from the computer mainframe lessor Data Processing Financial &amp; General (DPF&amp;G) suddenly stopped, the BCC-500 was transferred to the University of Hawaii, where it continued in use through the 1970s. It became part of the ALOHAnet.

Several BCC employees became the core of Xerox PARC&#x27;s computer research group (Deutsch, Lampson and Thacker) in 1970. Lichtenberger went to the University of Hawaii, and was an early employee at Cisco Systems.

Pirtle became technical director for the ILLIAC IV project at NASA Ames Research Center.

<text>Bernard Tschumi (born 25 January 1944 in Lausanne, Switzerland) is an architect, writer, and educator, commonly associated with deconstructivism. Son of the well-known Swiss architect Jean Tschumi and a French mother, Tschumi is a dual French-Swiss national who works and lives in New York City and Paris. He studied in Paris and at ETH in Zurich, where he received his degree in architecture in 1969. 

==Career==
Tschumi has taught in the UK and the USA; at Portsmouth University in Portsmouth and the Architectural Association in London, the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies in New York, Princeton University, the Cooper Union in New York and Columbia University where he was Dean of the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation from 1988 to 2003. Tschumi is a permanent US resident.

Tschumi&#x27;s first notable project was the Parc de la Villette, a competition project he won in 1983. Other projects include the new Acropolis Museum, Rouen Concert Hall, and bridge in La Roche-sur-Yon. Over his almost forty-year career, his built accomplishments number over sixty, including theoretical projects.

Tschumi studied at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich, Switzerland where he received an architecture degree in 1969. After school and prior to winning the Parc de La Villette competition, he built his reputation as a theorist through his writings and drawings. From 1988 to 2003 he was the Dean of Columbia University&#x27;s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. He&#x27;s held teaching positions at Princeton University, Cooper Union, and the Architectural Association in London. In 1996, he received the French Grand Prix National d&#x27;Architecture. He established his practice in 1983 in Paris with the Parc de La Villette competition commission. In 1988, he opened Bernard Tschumi Architects (BTA), headquartered in New York City. In 2002, Bernard Tschumi urbanistes Architectes (BtuA) was established in Paris.

===Theory===

==== 1960s–70s ====

Throughout his career, Bernard Tschumi&#x27;s work has reevaluated architecture&#x27;s role in the practice of personal and political freedom. Since the 1970s, Tschumi has argued that there is no fixed relationship between architectural form and the events that take place within it. The ethical and political imperatives that inform his work emphasize the establishment of a proactive architecture which non-hierarchically engages balances of power through programmatic and spatial devices. In Tschumi&#x27;s theory, architecture&#x27;s role is not to express an extant social structure, but to function as a tool for questioning that structure and revising it.

The experience of the May 1968 uprisings and the activities of the Situationist International oriented Tschumi&#x27;s approach to design studios and seminars he taught at the Architectural Association in London during the early 1970s. Within that pedagogical context he combined film and literary theory with architecture, expanding on the work of such thinkers as Roland Barthes and Michel Foucault, in order to reexamine architecture&#x27;s responsibility in reinforcing unquestioned cultural narratives. A big influence on this work were the theories and structural diagramming by the Russian cinematographer Sergei Eisenstein produced for his own films. Tschumi adapted Eisenstein&#x27;s diagrammatic methodology in his investigations to exploit the interstitial condition between the elements of which a system is made of: space, event, and movement (or activity). Best exemplified in his own words as, &quot;the football player skates across the battlefield.&quot; In this simple statement he was highlighting the dislocation of orientation and any possibility of a singular reading; a common resultant of the post-structuralist project.

This approach unfolded along two lines in his architectural practice: first, by exposing the conventionally defined connections between architectural sequences and the spaces, programs, and movement which produce and reiterate these sequences; and second, by inventing new associations between space and the events that &#x27;take place&#x27; within it through processes of defamiliarization, de-structuring, superimposition, and cross programming.

Tschumi&#x27;s work in the later 1970s was refined through courses he taught at the Architectural Association and projects such as The Screenplays (1977) and The Manhattan Transcripts (1981) and evolved from montage techniques taken from film and techniques of the nouveau roman. His use of event montage as a technique for the organization of program (systems of space, event, and movement, as well as visual and formal techniques) challenged the work other contemporary architects were conducting which focused on montage techniques as purely formal strategies. Tschumi&#x27;s work responded as well to prevalent strands of contemporary architectural theory that had reached a point of closure, either through a misunderstanding of post-structuralist thought, or the failure of the liberal/leftist dream of successful political and cultural revolution. For example, Superstudio, one such branch of theoretically oriented architectural postmodernists, began to produce ironic, unrealizable projects such as the 1969 Continuous Monument project, which functioned as counter design and critique of the existing architecture culture, suggesting the end of architecture&#x27;s capacity to effect change on an urban or cultural scale. Tschumi positioned his work to suggest alternatives to this endgame.

In 1978 he published an essay entitled &quot;The Pleasure of Architecture&quot; in which he used sexual intercourse as a characterizing analogy for architecture. He claimed that architecture by nature is fundamentally useless, setting it apart from &quot;building&quot;. He demands a glorification of architectural uselessness in which the chaos of sensuality and the order of purity combine to form structures that evoke the space in which they are built. He distinguishes between the forming of knowledge and the knowledge of form, contending that architecture is too often dismissed as the latter when it can often be used as the former. Tschumi used this essay as a precursor to a later eponymous series of writings detailing the so-called limits of architecture.

==== 1980s–90s ====
Tschumi&#x27;s winning entry for the 1982 55-hectare Parc de la Villette competition in Paris became his first major public work and made possible an implementation of The Manhattan Transcripts and The Screenplays. Landscaping, spatial and programmatic sequences in the park were used to produce sites of alternative social practice that challenged the expected use values usually reinforced by large urban parks in Paris. The Parc de la Villette is considered the &quot;largest deconstructed building in the world [...] as it&#x27;s one building, but broken down in many fragments.&quot;

He designed the Tokyo National Theater and Opera House in 1986, importing notational techniques from experimental dance and musical scores, and using the design process itself to challenge habitual ways of thinking about space, in contrast to earlier static, two dimensional representational techniques which delineated the outline of a building but not the intensity of life within it.

In 1988, the Museum of Modern Art launched an expo on deconstructivist architecture, with Bernard Tschumi among the showcased architects.

In 1990, he designed the Video Pavilion in Groningen, a simple rectangular small-size building with transparent walls. Its tilted floor breaks the convention of this simple edifice. In 1992 he designed Le Fresnoy, Studio National des Arts Contemporains, in Tourcoing, France, which was completed in 1999. The Le Fresnoy complex uses the space between the roofs of existing buildings and an added, huge umbrella roof above them which creates an interstitial zone of program on ramps and catwalks.

In 1995, he started to work on the Architecture School at Marne la Vallee, France (also completed in 1999).

The capacity of an overlap of programs to effect a reevaluation of architecture on an urban scale had also been tested in the 1988 Kansai Airport competition, Lausanne Bridge city, and 1989 Bibliothèque de France competition. In the Bibliothèque de France, a major aspect of the proposed scheme was a large public running track and sports facility on the roof of the complex, intersecting with upper floors of the library program so that neither the sports program nor the intellectual program could exist without an impact on the other.

In those projects, Tschumi suggested that habitual routines of daily life can be challenged by a spectrum of design tactics ranging from shock to subterfuge. The extreme limit-conditions of architectural program became criteria to evaluate a building&#x27;s capacity to function as a device capable of social organization.

==== 2010s ====

Tschumi&#x27;s critical understanding of architecture remains at the core of his practice today. By arguing that there is no space without event, he designs conditions for a reinvention of living, rather than repeating established aesthetic or symbolic conditions of design. Through these means architecture becomes a frame for &quot;constructed situations,&quot; a notion informed by the theory, city mappings and urban designs of the Situationist International.

Responding to the absence of ethical structure and the disjunction between use, form, and social values by which he characterizes the postmodern condition, Tschumi&#x27;s design research encourages a wide range of narratives and ambiences to emerge and to self organize. Although his conclusion is that no essentially meaningful relationship exists between a space and the events which occur within it, Tschumi nonetheless aligns his work with Foucault&#x27;s notion that social structures should be evaluated not according to an a priori notion of good or evil but for their danger to each other. In this way, Tschumi&#x27;s work is ethologically motivated, in the sense that Deleuze uses the term to propose an emergent ethics that depends on a reevaluation of self/identity and body. Freedom is thus defined by the enhanced range of capacity of this extended body/self in conjunction with an extended self-awareness. By advocating recombinations of program, space, and cultural narrative, Tschumi asks the user to critically reinvent him/herself as a subject.

Tschumi, well known for his radical theories on post-structuralist architecture in the 1960s and &#x27;70s, won the commission for the New Acropolis Museum in a competition. The museum offers a seemingly placid stance, focused on the impressive Athenian light and landscape while remaining precise in imagination and sophisticated in form.

===Criticism===
Tschumi&#x27;s work has been criticized for sacrificing human needs for intellectual purposes. Most currently, the Greek mathematician Nikos Salingaros claims that the New Acropolis Museum clashes with the traditional architecture of Athens and continues to unnecessarily threaten historical buildings nearby. Other critics praised the Museum:

&quot;It is very contextual and powerfully respectful of the urban fabric of Athens while doing a dance around the ruins.&quot; Comments of the AIA Honor Award Jury writing in 2011.

&quot;a quiet work…a building that is both an enlightening meditation on the Parthenon and a mesmerizing work in its own right.&quot; New York Times critic Nicolai Ouroussoff

&quot;A geometrical marvel dedicated to the celebration of antiquity…a purposefully, rather than gratuitously, dynamic building.&quot; Jonathan Glancey, Guardian

Critic Christopher Hume wrote &quot;Tschumi&#x27;s building is impressive and fully engaged. It is thoroughly 21st-century, but it is not starchitecture, or anything like it. Rather, it&#x27;s an elegant and thoughtful building intended to serve the collection it contains – a model of architectural restraint, if not self-effacement.&quot;

<doc id="267896" wikidata="Q655754" url="?curid=267896" title="Platte River">
<text>The Platte River () is a major American river, in the state of Nebraska. It is about long; measured to its farthest source via its tributary, the North Platte River, it flows for over . The Platte River is a tributary of the Missouri River, which itself is a tributary of the Mississippi River which flows to the Gulf of Mexico. The Platte over most of its length is a broad, shallow, meandering stream with a sandy bottom and many islands—a braided stream.

The Platte is one of the most significant tributary systems in the watershed of the Missouri, draining a large portion of the central Great Plains in Nebraska and the eastern Rocky Mountains in Colorado and Wyoming. The river valley played an important role in the westward expansion of the United States, providing the route for several major emigrant trails, including the Oregon, California, Mormon and Bozeman trails. The first Europeans to see the Platte were French explorers and fur trappers about 1714; they first called it the &quot;Nebraskier&quot; (Nebraska), a transliteration of the name given by the Otoe people, meaning &quot;flat water&quot;. This expression is very close to the French words &quot;rivière platte&quot; (&quot;flat river&quot;), the probable origin of the name Platte River.

==Geography==

===Headwaters===
The Platte River is formed in western Nebraska east of the city of North Platte, Nebraska by the confluence of the North Platte and the South Platte Rivers, which both arise from snowmelt in the eastern Rockies east of the Continental Divide.

In central north Colorado is the North Park valley, ringed by mountains of 12,000 feet (3,700 m) height; this is where the North Platte River originates. The head of the North Platte River is essentially all of Jackson County; its boundaries are the continental divide on the west and south and the mountain drainage peaks on the east—the north boundary is the state of Wyoming. The nearest Colorado town is Walden, the county seat. The rugged Rocky Mountains Continental Divide surrounding Jackson County have at least twelve peaks over 11,000 feet (3,400 m) in height. From Jackson County, the North Platte flows north about out of the Routt National Forest and North Park near what is now Walden to Casper, Wyoming. Shortly after passing Casper, the North Platte turns to the east-southeast and flows about to the city of North Platte, Nebraska. In Colorado and Wyoming, the North Platte is narrower and much swifter flowing than it is in Nebraska, where it becomes a slow flowing, shallow braided stream.
The North Platte River has been dammed about eight times for water storage and irrigation purposes in Wyoming and Nebraska as it flows to its confluence with the South Platte River. The upper reaches of the river in the Rockies in Colorado and Wyoming are popular for recreation rafting and lure and fly fishing for rainbow, brown, cutthroat trout and other sport fish. In western Nebraska, the banks and riverbed of the North Platte provide a green oasis amid an otherwise semi-arid region of North America. Today, by the time the North Platte reaches Paxton, Nebraska it is much smaller due to the extensive water taken from it for irrigation. Historically, the North Platte River was up to a mile wide (1.6 km) in many places, as evidenced by the old streambed and historic written records.

The South Platte River drainage includes about in the north east corner of Colorado, parts of southeastern Wyoming in the vicinity of the city of Cheyenne and a small part of the southwest corner of Nebraska. The South Platte drains a large part of the Front Range mountains east of the continental divide. The part of the river labeled the South Platte is formed in Park County, Colorado, located southwest of Denver, in the South Park grassland basin and mountains east of the continental divide. It is formed by the confluence of the South Fork South Platte River and Middle Fork South Platte River, approximately southeast of Fairplay, Colorado. After the South and Middle fork join, the South Platte flows east-southeast till it exits Elevenmile Reservoir; it turns almost ninety degrees to skirt the west side of Pikes Peak and flows roughly east-northeast about through Denver and on to Greeley, Colorado. From Greeley, the South Platte turns east and flows about to its confluence with the North Platte River near the city of North Platte, Nebraska.

The South Platte River has been dammed about 20 times for water storage, drinking water and irrigation purposes in Colorado as it flows to its confluence with the North Platte River. The total number of dams in the South Platte drainage may exceed 1,000 as nearly all major streams have at least one dam on them. The South Platte River serves as the principal source of water for arid eastern Colorado. The South Platte River valley provided a major emigration path to Denver. The wagon trails followed the south side of the Platte/North Platte River. Wagon trains were ferried or waded in low water years across the swampy-bottomed South Platte River in several places to stay on the south side of the North Platte River where the trails were located. Miners who later went on to Denver followed the South Platte River trail into Colorado.

===Main stem===
After the North Platte and the South Platte rivers join to form the Platte River, over most of its length it is a sandy, broad, shallow, braided river. Its many shallow channels and islands and ever-changing sandbars made navigation difficult; it was never used as a major water transportation route. The Platte flows in a large arc, east-southeast to near Fort Kearny and then east-northeast, across Nebraska south of Grand Island and on to Columbus. The Platte River is joined from the north by the about Loup River about southeast of Columbus. During pioneer days, a Loup River ferry crossed the river. From Columbus, the Platte flows almost due east about past North Bend and then on to Fremont.

Near Fremont, the Platte bends south and then east around the location of Omaha in a large &quot;L&quot; turn. Near Fremont the Platte turns sharply and flows south-southeast about to about Waterloo, Nebraska—located about west of Omaha. Near Waterloo the Platte turns even more and heads almost due south for about . About east-southeast of Waterloo and about from the Platte&#x27;s confluence with the Missouri River, the Platte is joined from the north by the Elkhorn River. The Elkhorn, a river, originates in the eastern Sandhills of Nebraska and is one of the largest tributaries of the Platte River. The Elkhorn joins the Platte on its south-bound path just southwest of Omaha, approximately 1 mile (2 km) south and 3 miles (5 km) west of Gretna. The pioneers leaving from near Omaha (established 1854) or Council Bluffs, Iowa (established 1846) used the Mormon Trail north of the Platte River and had to ferry across the Elkhorn. After the Union Pacific railroad was constructed west from Omaha in 1866, it had to build a major bridge across the Elkhorn. After the confluence of the Elkhorn and the Platte River, the Platte continues southward, about before it turns sharply and heads almost due East for about before its confluence with the Missouri River. Sarpy County is shaped like a crescent, being bounded on the east by the Missouri River, on the south and west by the Platte, and on the north by Douglas County which contains Omaha. The Platte-Missouri River confluence is about south of Omaha.

Including the North Platte River, the Platte River stretches over , with a drainage basin of about . The mean annual flow is estimated at . The Platte drains one of the most arid areas of the Great Plains with a flow that is considerably lower than rivers of comparable length in North America. For much of its length, it is a classic wide, muddy and shallow braided stream which in the lower reaches flows in a floodplain bordered by bluffs. During pioneer days, the common humorous description was that the Platte was &quot;a mile wide at the mouth, but only six inches deep.&quot; 49ers said it was &quot;too thick to drink, too thin to plow&quot;. In western Nebraska, the banks and riverbed of the Platte provide a green oasis amid an otherwise semi-arid region of North America. The central Platte River valley is an important stopover for migratory water birds, such as the whooping crane and sandhill crane, in their yearly traversal of the Central Flyway. Fossil evidence in the Platte River valley indicates this crane stopover has been active for over 10 million years.

Since the mid-20th century, this river has shrunk significantly. This reduction in size is attributed in part to its waters being used for irrigation, and to a much greater extent to the waters diverted and used by the growing population of Colorado, which has outstripped the ability of its groundwater to sustain them.

==History==
Varying cultures of indigenous peoples lived intermittently along the Platte for thousands of years before European exploration. Historical tribes claimed various territories in the region. The Indian tribes typically visited different areas in different seasons, as they followed the bison herds for hunting periods. The introduction of horses, which had escaped from early Spanish explorers in the 1540s, dramatically changed life in the Great Plains. Indian tribes could more easily follow the buffalo herds as they migrated from north to south and back. Before 1870, herds of several hundred thousand bison (buffalo) periodically migrated across the Platte in following seasonal grazing. The animals often waded or swam across the Platte. The first-known European to see the Platte was the French explorer Étienne de Veniard, sieur de Bourgmont in 1714, who named it the &quot;Nebraskier&quot;, after its Oto name, meaning &quot;flat water&quot;. The French later applied the French word &quot;plate&quot; (meaning flat, and pronounced &quot;plat&quot;, or &quot;platte&quot;) to the river.

Occupied by various Indian tribes for part of each year, the Platte River territory had been claimed by both Spanish and French explorers trying to rule the Great Plains. Spain had claimed all of the Great Plains after Coronado&#x27;s 1541–42 expedition. Jose Naranjo, an African-Hopi who served as a Spanish scout and explorer in the Southwest, was a war captain of the Spanish Indian auxiliaries. By 1714 (the same year the French explorers reached the Platte), he and a small exploration group from the south had reportedly already reached the Platte three times. He later guided the 1720 Villasur expedition to the area in a Spanish effort to stop French expansion onto the Great Plains. Naranjo and Villasur&#x27;s party made the most northern of Spanish exploration trips into the central plains. A Pawnee and Otoe Indian attack defeated the Spanish forces; the survivors returned to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and the Spanish left the Great Plains to the American Indians.

As a result of the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763) (called the French and Indian War in America), the French ceded all of their lands in North America east of the Mississippi River to the British. The Spanish took over lands west of the Mississippi River. Since there were few fur-bearing animals on the Platte of interest to the fur traders, the French and British explorers and fur trappers ignored the Platte territory for some time. During the course of the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815), France briefly reacquired the land west of the Mississippi River from Spain.

In 1804, Napoleon sold the area west of the Mississippi River to the US in the Louisiana Purchase; the US roughly doubled its area at a cost of about $15,000,000. In 1820 the U.S. Army ordered Major Stephen H. Long to explore and map the area around the Platte. Long reported the area as a great American desert, despite its native inhabitants and wildlife, due to a lack of easily-cultivated land. As a result of his and other reports, the US initially had little interest in settling the land on the plains. The next &quot;good&quot; land was believed to be in Oregon or California, especially the coastal areas, and those were the destinations of most emigrant traffic. The Mormons settled Utah, largely due to religious persecution in eastern areas. Various gold and silver strikes attracted further emigration to nearly all western states.

The Native American trail west along the Platte, North Platte River and Sweetwater River was first written about after its discovery in 1811 by Wilson Price Hunt of the Astor Expedition. He was returning to the Missouri River posts from the newly established Fort Astoria on the Columbia River near the Pacific Ocean. Because few American trappers and settlers were then in the contested Oregon Territory, his trail discovery was little used and nearly forgotten.

In 1823 Jedediah Smith and several trappers &quot;rediscovered&quot; the route. The trail along the Platte, North Platte and Sweetwater rivers became a major route of fur traders to their summer Rocky Mountain Rendezvous. In 1824 fur trappers and traders directing mule trains carrying trade goods and supplies for the mountain men were some of the first European-American parties to use the trail. On their return trip, the fur traders carried out furs destined for eastern markets. The fur trade route was used to about 1840.

By about 1832, the fur traders had improved the trail along the Platte, North Platte, and Sweetwater rivers to a rough wagon trail from the Missouri River to the Green River in Wyoming, where most of the Rocky Mountain Rendezvous were held. In 1834 Benjamin Bonneville, a U.S. Army officer on leave, led an expedition to the west financed by John Jacob Astor. They took wagons along the Platte, North Platte and Sweetwater River trail to the Green River in present-day Wyoming. The notable author Washington Irving wrote an account of Bonneville&#x27;s explorations in the west that made him well known in the US.

Following the fur traders, the major emigration trails established along the north and south banks of the Platte and North Platte River were the Oregon (1843–1869), California (1843–1869), Mormon (1847–1869) and the Bozeman (1863–68) trails. This network of trails, sometimes called the Emigrant Trails or the Great Platte River Road, all went west along both sides of the Platte River. The route along the Platte River included all these emigration trails and was developed as an important trail route used by migrant wagon trains for westward United States expansion after 1841. The settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute with Britain in 1846, the conclusion of the Mexican–American War in 1848, and the California Gold Rush in 1849 and other gold and silver strikes rapidly attracted increased emigrant traffic west.

The Platte River in the future state of Nebraska and the North Platte River in Wyoming typically had many channels and islands. The waterways were often too shallow, crooked, muddy and unpredictable for a canoe to travel far. The Platte River valley provided an easily passable wagon corridor; it sloped gradually up in height as it went almost due west from the Missouri. The Platte route had access to water, grass, buffalo and buffalo &#x27;chips,&#x27; which the Indians and emigrants used as fuel for fires. Long Native American use had created trails on both sides of the muddy, about wide and shallow Platte River. The Platte&#x27;s water was silty and bad tasting, but it was usable if no other water was available. Emigrants learned to let it sit in a bucket for an hour or so to settle most of the silt. The trail(s) through the Platte River Valley extended about in the present state of Nebraska. Nearly all the trails from the Missouri converged on the Platte River at or before Fort Kearny in mid-state Nebraska. Historians have estimated about 400,000 emigrants followed the trails along the Platte. The influx of so many emigrants strained the local ecosystem, to the point that in 1846, chief They Fear Even His Horses demanded compensation from the President of the United States (referred to as &quot;tȟuŋkášila&quot;, the Great Father) for the damage Americans caused to the Platte. It also bought an epidemic of cholera that killed around 15% of the Lakota people between 1848 and 1849. The Lakota made plans for war, and in response, the United States convened the Lakota and other Plains Indians for the Treaty of Fort Laramie.

The Pony Express, operational from 1860–61, and the First Transcontinental Telegraph, completed in 1861, both followed the earlier emigrant trails along the Platte. The completion of the telegraph put the Pony Express out of business as it could provide much faster east–west communication. In 1866 the Union Pacific portion of the first Transcontinental Railroad was constructed along the Platte River as it started west from Omaha. In the 20th century, the Lincoln Highway and later Interstate 80 were constructed through the Platte valley. The highways parallel the Platte and the North Platte through much of Nebraska.

Many of Nebraska’s larger cities originated on or near the Platte River, as it was the first path of transportation. These include Omaha (est. 1854), Fort Kearny (est. 1848), Grand Island (est. 1857) and North Platte (est. 1869). In 1859 settlers built the first irrigation ditch to divert water from the Platte for farming.

In March 1924, the U.S. Army Air Corps conducted a three-day bombing campaign on an ice gorge that threatened bridges near the town of North Bend.

==Ecosystem==
The Platte is in the middle of the Central Flyway, a primary north–south corridor for migratory birds from their summer nesting grounds in the north (Alaska and Canada), south for the winter, and the return in the spring. The Central Flyway bird species include trumpeter swans, tundra swans, over one million Canada geese, greater white-fronted geese, sandhill cranes, canvasback ducks and others. Other species such as bald eagles, herons and several species of ducks migrate through the Platte River area but over shorter distances. The whooping crane, piping plover, and the interior least tern are birds using the flyway which have been classified as endangered and are protected under the Platte River Endangered Species Partnership.

Common plants in the Platte River area are big and little bluestem, switch grass, and cottonwood trees. White-tail deer, many types of catfish, Canada geese, and bald eagles attract fans. The Platte River area has long supported many animals but recently, due to urbanization and farming causing loss of habitat, the numbers have declined. Canada geese have adapted to the farm fields and scavenge a large part of their fare from unharvested grain. Many have taken up residence at suburban office parks and stopped seasonal migrations.

==Management and policy==
The Platte River flowing through an arid part of the mid-west has been widely overused. The claims on the Platte River water have exceeded the supply of water in drier years. Under Nebraska law, a river basin, subbasin, or reach shall be deemed overappropriated if it is subject to an interstate cooperative agreement among more states and if, prior to such date, the state has declared a moratorium on the issuance of new surface water appropriations in such river, subbasin, or reach, and has requested each natural resources district jurisdiction in the affected area to close or continue in effect a previously adopted closure of part of such river basin, subbasin, or reach to the issuance of additional water well permits, or to temporarily suspend or continue in effect a temporary suspension previously adopted on the drilling of new water wells in all or part of such river basin, subbasin, or reach. Most of the Platte River basin is currently considered as overappropriated.

Beginning in 2004, a number of Nebraska stakeholders embarked upon the Platte River Cooperative Hydrology Study (COHYST). Conducted with assistance from the United States Geological Survey and the Natural Resources Conservation Service, this study attempts to arrive at a better understanding of the geology and hydrology of the Platte River basin from the Colorado and Wyoming borders to Columbus, including the Loup basin. This improved understanding could be used to develop policies for management of the river system, both for human use and for the sake of the basin&#x27;s endangered species. As of October 2009, the study is still ongoing.

<text>Karaganda (, ; ), also known as Karagandy (, ; ; ) (also sometimes romanized as Qaraghandy), is a major city in central Kazakhstan and the capital of the Karaganda Region. It is the fifth most populous city in the country, with a population of 497,777 as of the 2020 Census, marking an increase from 459,778 in 2009 and 436,864 in 1999. Karaganda is located approximately 230 kilometers (140 miles) southeast of Kazakhstan&#x27;s capital city, Astana.

Historically, Karaganda has been a central hub for coal mining, which has shaped its economy and development. The city saw significant growth during the Soviet Union, driven by the expansion of its coal industry. Coal remains a key sector in the city&#x27;s economy, with mining continuing to be a significant contributor to its industrial base.

In addition to its industrial roots, Karaganda is home to a growing population and a rich cultural heritage. The city hosts several educational institutions, such as Karaganda State University, which support its role as an academic and research center in central Kazakhstan. Karaganda’s infrastructure and economy have been evolving, with modernization efforts in various sectors, including transportation, healthcare, and housing.

Karaganda is also known for its historical significance, having played an important role in the industrial development of the Soviet Union. Today, it stands as a key city in Kazakhstan, contributing to the country’s economy while maintaining its historical and cultural heritage.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Karaganda&quot; is derived from &quot;caragana&quot; bushes (&quot;Caragana arborescens&quot;, &quot;Caragana frutex&quot;), which are abundant in the area.

== History ==
=== Old Town ===

Modern-day Karaganda dates back to 1833, when local shepherd allegedly found coal on the site of the city, prompting a coal mining boom. By the late 19th century, the local mines had attracted workers from nearby villages, Russian merchants, and entrepreneurs from France and England. After this initial boom, the mines were abandoned, but are often still labeled on city maps as the &quot;Old Town&quot;, but almost nothing remains on that site.

=== 20th century ===
In the late 1920s, Soviet geologists examined the region&#x27;s coal deposits, prompting Soviet authorities to establish the Karaganda Coal Trust, and plan for the creation of coal mines and a mining town in the area. Planners set out to create a dozen coal mines, and drafted blueprints for a city to house an estimated 40,000 workers. Coal mining in the area resumed in 1930, and temporary structures were built for miners and their families. The new area for the city was to the south of the initial mines. Initially, Karaganda suffered from an inadequate amount of supplies, and living conditions in the settlement were often poor. In 1930, coal production was below expectations. In February 1931, the area was connected via railroad, bringing in a wealth of supplies and highly-qualified personnel. Later that year, NKVD officials established the Karlag Prison. Upon the establishment of the Karlag Prison, authorities began to import labor into the region en masse. During the 1930s, the area experienced rapid growth. In 1931, Karaganda was incorporated as a village, and in 1934, was declared a city. Led by planner Alexander Ivanovich Kuznetsov, masters plans for Karaganda were laid out from 1934 until 1938. During the Stalinist purges, peoples from many different nationalities, including Germans, Karachais, Kalmyks, Chechens, Ingush, Greeks, and Crimean Tatars were sent to Karlag. By 1939, Karaganda had a population of about 100,000, about half of which were prisoners.

In the 1940s, up to 70% of the city&#x27;s inhabitants were ethnic Germans. Most of the ethnic Germans were Soviet Volga Germans who were collectively deported to Siberia and Kazakhstan on Stalin&#x27;s order when Hitler invaded Soviet-annexed eastern Poland and the Soviet Union proper in 1941. Until the 1950s, many of these deportees were interned in labor camps, often simply because they were of German descent. The population of Karaganda fell by 14% from 1989 to 1999 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union; it was once Kazakhstan&#x27;s second-largest city after Almaty. Over 100,000 people have since emigrated to Germany. There is also a concentration of ethnic Poles in the city.

Robert F. Kennedy (later US Attorney General and US Senator), alongside US Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, visited &quot;five Soviet Central Asian Republics&quot;: Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tadzhikistan, Kirghizia, and Kazakhstan. While on the six week trip (e.g., Bukhara, 300 to 1 mosque after Soviet rule), his biographers reported that their delegation was not allowed to visit the city of Karaganda which was one of the sites of the most notorious labor camps within the confines of the Soviet Union. The delegation was diverted to Siberia after four denials of visas.

==== 1962 electromagnetic pulse incident ====

Karaganda suffered the most severe electromagnetic pulse effects ever observed when its electrical power plant was set on fire by currents induced in a long shallow buried power cable by Soviet Test ‘184’ on 22 October 1962. The test was part of the Soviet Project K nuclear tests (ABM System A proof tests), and consisted of a 300-kiloton high-altitude nuclear explosion at an altitude of over Zhezkazgan.

Prompt gamma ray-produced EMP induced a current of 2,500 amps measured by spark gaps in a stretch of overhead telephone line to Zharyq, blowing all the protective fuses. The late-time MHD-EMP was of low enough frequency to enable it to penetrate into the ground, overloading a shallow buried lead and steel tape-protected long power cable between Aqmola (now called Astana) and Almaty. It fired circuit breakers and set the Karaganda power plant on fire.

==== Late 20th century ====
Kuznetsov&#x27;s master plan for the city was intended to accommodate 300,000 inhabitants, which was surpassed by the late 1960s. This prompted planners to devise a new plan with the goal of accommodating 600,000 people. By the 1980s, the city&#x27;s population surpassed 600,000 people, creating the need for further expansion. In 1983, the Karaganda Circus was constructed, which was criticized for its high cost.

In the early 1990s, Karaganda was briefly considered as a candidate for the capital of the (then) newly independent Republic of Kazakhstan, but its bid was turned down in favour of Astana.

=== 21st century ===
==== 2019 archaeological findings ====
In July 2019, remains of a young couple buried face to face dated 4,000 years back were unearthed in Karaganda region in central Kazakhstan by a group of archaeologists led by Igor Kukushkin from Saryarka Archaeological Institute in Karaganda. It is assumed that the Bronze Age couple were 16 or 17 years old when they died. Kukushkin supposes that they were from a &#x27;noble family&#x27; thanks to the buried gold and jewelry artifacts, ceramic pots, woman&#x27;s two bracelets on each arm beads, remains of horses and knives found in the grave.

==== 2023 Kostenko mine fire ====

On 28 October 2023 the Kostenko mine, a coal mine in Karaganda run by ArcelorMittal Temirtau, the local unit of ArcelorMittal, caught fire, killing at least 32 people. In weeks prior to the fire, the Kazakhstani government announced it was in talks to take over part of ArcelorMittal Temirtau&#x27;s operations, in part due to its dissatisfaction by ArcelorMittal&#x27;s failure to invest more in its operations, including equipment upgrades and safety precautions.

== Geography ==
Karaganda is located in a steppe area of the Kazakh Uplands at an elevation of . To the northeast flows the Nura river and to the west the Sherubainura, its main tributary. In the southern part of the city lies the Fedorov Reservoir, built in 1941 by filling a coal mine pit with the water of river Sokyr that flows along the southern limit. The Bugyly Range (Бұғылы), reaching a height of , rises about to the south of the city. The Bugyly Nature Reserve is located in the range.

=== Climate ===
Karaganda has a Continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) with warm summers and very cold winters.

The lowest temperature on record is , recorded in 1938, and the highest temperature is , recorded in 2002.

=== Pollution ===
Due to the prominence of heavy industry in Karaganda, the city experiences a high level of air pollution. Air pollution tracking company IQAir found it to have Kazakhstan&#x27;s highest level of PM2.5 concentration among cities measured from 2017 to 2022, and the 23rd highest in the world among cities measured.

== Economy ==
Karaganda is a largely industrial city, and coal mining is a major component of its economy. As of 2023, the city hosts 8 coal mines, and during the times of the Soviet Union, hosted as many as 26. 

Since local water resources are not sufficient for the needs of a major industrial city, the Irtysh–Karaganda Canal was constructed in the 1960s, to supply the Karaganda metropolitan area with water from the Irtysh River more than away.

== Culture ==
=== Religion ===

The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Karaganda. In 2012, the Catholic Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Fatima was opened.

== In popular culture ==
Karaganda was often used as the punchline in a popular joke in the former Soviet Union. Karaganda is fairly isolated in a vast area of uninhabited steppe, and is thought by many to be &quot;the middle of nowhere&quot;. When used in the locative case (Караганде), the final syllable rhymes with the Russian word for &quot;where&quot; (где), as well as with a Russian obscenity used to answer to an unwanted question &quot;Where?&quot;. Thus the exchange: &quot;Где?&quot; — &quot;В Караганде!&quot; (&quot;Where?&quot; — &quot;In Karaganda!&quot;). In 2011 an art-installation was installed in Karaganda, deticated to this phrase.

Author Flora Leipman, a British resident who moved to the Soviet Union during the 1930s, wrote about her time in the Karlag Prison near Karaganda, and her subsequent decades where she lived in Karaganda, in her book &quot;The Long Journey Home&quot;. The labor camp described in One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich where the author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had served some time was located near Karaganda.

<doc id="267909" wikidata="Q407699" url="?curid=267909" title="Arachidonic acid">
<text>Arachidonic acid (AA, sometimes ARA) is a polyunsaturated omega−6 fatty acid 20:4(ω−6), or 20:4(5,8,11,14). If its precursors or diet contains linoleic acid it is formed by biosynthesis and can be deposited in animal fats. It is a precursor in the formation of leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and thromboxanes. 

Together with omega−3 fatty acids and other omega−6 fatty acids, arachidonic acid provides energy for body functions, contributes to cell membrane structure, and participates in the synthesis of eicosanoids, which have numerous roles in physiology as signaling molecules.

Its name derives from the ancient Greek neologism &quot;arachis&quot; &#x27;peanut&#x27;, although peanut oil does not contain any arachidonic acid. Arachidonate is the name of the derived carboxylate anion (conjugate base of the acid), salts, and some esters.

==Chemistry==
In chemical structure, arachidonic acid is a carboxylic acid with a 20-carbon chain and four &quot;cis&quot;-double bonds; the first double bond is located at the sixth carbon from the omega end.

Some chemistry sources define &#x27;arachidonic acid&#x27; to designate any of the eicosatetraenoic acids. However, almost all writings in biology, medicine, and nutrition limit the term to &quot;all cis&quot;-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid.

==Biology==
Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid present in the phospholipids (especially phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylinositides) of membranes of the body&#x27;s cells, and is abundant in the brain, muscles, and liver. Skeletal muscle is an especially active site of arachidonic acid retention, accounting for roughly 10–20% of the phospholipid fatty acid content typically.

In addition to being involved in cellular signaling as a lipid second messenger involved in the regulation of signaling enzymes, such as PLC-γ, PLC-δ, and PKC-α, -β, and -γ isoforms, arachidonic acid is a key inflammatory intermediate and can also act as a vasodilator. (Note separate synthetic pathways, as described in section below.)

==Biosynthesis and cascade in humans==

Arachidonic acid is freed from phospholipid by hydrolysis, catalyzed by the phospholipase A2 (PLA2).

Arachidonic acid for signaling purposes appears to be derived by the action of group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2, 85 kDa), whereas inflammatory arachidonic acid is generated by the action of a low-molecular-weight secretory PLA2 (sPLA2, 14-18 kDa).

Arachidonic acid is a precursor to a wide range of eicosanoids:
* The enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (i.e. prostaglandin G/H synthase 1 and 2 [⁠PTGS1 and PTGS2]) convert arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2 and prostaglandin H2, which in turn may be converted to various prostaglandins, to prostacyclin, to thromboxanes, and to the 17-carbon product of thromboxane metabolism of prostaglandin G2/H2, 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (12-HHT). 
* The enzyme 5-lipoxygenase catalyzes the oxidation of arachidonic acid to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE), which in turn converts to various leukotrienes (i.e., leukotriene B4, leukotriene C4, leukotriene D4, and leukotriene E4) as well as to 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) which may then be further metabolized to 5-HETE&#x27;s more potent 5-keto analog, 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE) (also see 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid).
* The enzymes 15-lipoxygenase-1 (ALOX15) and 15-lipoxygenase-2 (ALOX15B). ALOX15B catalyzes the oxidation of arachidonic acid to 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HPETE), which may then be further converted to 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) and lipoxins; 15-Lipoxygenase-1 may also further metabolize 15-HPETE to eoxins in a pathway analogous to (and presumably using the same enzymes as used in) the pathway which metabolizes 5-HPETE to leukotrienes.
* The enzyme 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12) catalyzes oxidation of arachidonic acid to 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HPETE), which may then be metabolized to 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) and to hepoxilins.
* Arachidonic acid is also a precursor to anandamide.
* Some arachidonic acid is converted into hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) by epoxygenase.

The production of these derivatives and their actions in the body are collectively known as the &quot;arachidonic acid cascade&quot;; see Essential fatty acid interactions and the enzyme and metabolite linkages given in the previous paragraph for more details.

===PLA2 activation===

PLA2, in turn, is activated by ligand binding to receptors, including:
* 5-HT2 receptors 
* mGLUR1
* bFGF receptor
* IFN-α receptor
* IFN-γ receptor

Furthermore, any agent increasing intracellular calcium may cause activation of some forms of PLA2.

===PLC activation===

Alternatively, arachidonic acid may be cleaved from phospholipids after phospholipase C (PLC) cleaves off the inositol trisphosphate group, yielding diacylglycerol (DAG), which subsequently is cleaved by DAG lipase to yield arachidonic acid.

Receptors that activate this pathway include:
* A1 receptor
* D2 receptor
* α2 adrenergic receptor
* 5-HT1 receptor

PLC may also be activated by MAP kinase. Activators of this pathway include PDGF and FGF.

==In the body==

===Cell membranes===
Along with other omega−6 and omega−3 fatty acids, arachidonic acid contributes to the structure of cell membranes. When incorporated into phospholipids, the omega fatty acids affect cell membrane properties, such as permeability and the activity of enzymes and cell-signaling mechanisms.

===Brain===
Arachidonic acid, one of the most abundant fatty acids in the brain, is present in similar quantities to docosahexaenoic acid, with the two accounting for about 20% of brain fatty-acid content. Arachidonic acid is involved in the early neurological development of infants.

==Dietary supplement==

Arachidonic acid is marketed as a dietary supplement. A 2019 review of clinical studies investigating the potential health effects of arachidonic acid supplementation of up to 1500 mg per day on human health found there were no clear benefits. There were no adverse effects in adults of using high daily doses (1500 mg) of arachidonic acid on several biomarkers of blood chemistry, immune function, and inflammation.

A 2009 review indicated that consumption of 5−10% of food energy from omega−6 fatty acids including arachidonic acid may reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases compared to lower intakes. A 2014 meta-analysis of possible associations between heart disease risk and individual fatty acids reported a significantly reduced risk of heart disease with higher levels of EPA, DHA, and arachidonic acid.

<doc id="267911" wikidata="Q156833" url="?curid=267911" title="Ramiz Alia">
<text>Ramiz Alia (; 18 October 1925 – 7 October 2011) was an Albanian politician serving as the second and last leader of the People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania from 1985 to 1991, serving as First Secretary of the Party of Labour of Albania. He was also the country&#x27;s head of state from 1982 to 1992. He had been seen as a successor by Enver Hoxha and took power after Hoxha died.

==Early life and politics==

Alia was born on October 18, 1925, in Shkodër to Gheg Albanian parents who were Muslim. They fled persecution in Yugoslavia. He grew up and spent his childhood in Tirana. In the early part of World War II, Alia was a member of a fascist youth organisation known as the Fascist Lictor Youth Organisation but joined the underground Albanian Communist Youth Organisation in 1941. In 1943, he became a member of the Albanian Communist Party. He had risen rapidly under Hoxha&#x27;s patronage, and was elected to the Central Committee in 1948, and in 1956, was named a candidate member of the Politburo. By 1961, he was made a full member of the Politburo (Politburo of the Party of Labour of Albania). Alia distinguished himself as the chief ideologist in the social and cultural fields for the Party of Labour of Albania, specifically during the years of the Cultural and Ideological Revolution.

Although Hoxha never designated an official successor, there were clear signs that he favoured Alia. In introducing Alia to one of his doctors, Hoxha said &quot;My friend, I&#x27;m getting old, and my health is not the best it could be. Younger comrades, like this one [Alia], will step in.&quot; 

==Political career==

===First Secretary of the Albanian Labour Party===
After World War II, Alia resumed his duties in the Communist Youth Organisation, and at the First Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour in November 1948, he was elected to its Central Committee and was assigned to the department of agitation and propaganda. 

As late as 1988, Alia had continued insisting that Hoxha was the only statesman in decades who stayed loyal to Marxism-Leninism, claiming in his speech at the unveiling of Hoxha&#x27;s statue in Skanderbeg Square: &quot;Enver Hoxha has been and remains to this day the only name among the communist leaders of the last 4–5 decades who defended the teachings of Marxism-Leninism, the ideals of the revolution and socialism, both in theory and practice.&quot;

===Transition to multi-party system and presidency===
Despite Alia&#x27;s efforts to proceed with change on a limited, cautious basis, reform from above threatened to turn into reform from below, largely because of the increasingly vocal demands of Albania&#x27;s youth. On 9 December 1990, student demonstrators marched from the Enver Hoxha University (now University of Tirana) at Tirana through the streets of the capital shouting slogans and demanding reforms. By 11 December, the number of participants had reached almost 3,000. In an effort to quell the student unrest, which had led to clashes with riot police, Alia met with the students and agreed to take further steps toward democratization. The students informed Alia that they wanted to create an independent political organisation of students and youth. Alia&#x27;s response was that such an organisation had to be registered with the Ministry of Justice.

In his traditional New Year&#x27;s message to the Albanian people, Alia welcomed the changes that had been occurring in the country and claimed that 1991 would be a turning point in terms of the economy.

Alia was a crucial figure in the peaceful political transition of the early 1990s. Many believe that he helped the rise to power of the anti-communist opposition forces, thus eliminating possible bloodshed. He managed to remain a key political figure throughout several political crises. Nonetheless, with Albania in the throes of a grave economic crisis, Alia had to face challenges that he could not surmount. On 12 December 1990, he signed a law allowing political pluralism, on which he would later comment as his life&#x27;s greatest failure. In the 1991 elections, the first democratic elections in the country, where Alia ran for Member of National Parliament in a constituency in the capital, which was a stronghold of the communist party, he was badly defeated by a surprising majority of 61% by the renowned mining engineer in the country, Franko Kroqi. Kroqi ran as a candidate of the newly formed Democratic Party of Albania, although he never became a party member.

After this loss, and later on the Democratic Party of Albania&#x27;s landslide victory in the spring 1992 general election, he resigned as president on 3 April 1992. On 9 April the People&#x27;s Assembly elected DPA leader Sali Berisha as Albania&#x27;s new head of state.

==Arrest==
On 21 May 1994, senior officials from the Communist government, including Ramiz Alia, went on trial. Alia was charged with abuse of power and misappropriation of state funds, as was prime minister Adil Çarçani, deputy prime minister Manush Myftiu, and Rita Marko who was a vice-president.

Alia had been placed under house arrest in August 1992 and his detention was converted into imprisonment in August 1993. In court he claimed he was the victim of a political show trial and demanded that the trial be broadcast on television, a request denied by the presiding judge. The trial was monitored by a Human Rights Watch representative and proceeded with only minor due process irregularities. The ten defendants were found guilty as charged and sentenced to between three and nine years in prison; Alia received a nine-year sentence.

A court of appeals subsequently reduced some of the sentences, notably Alia&#x27;s to five years. Alia, Myftiu, Carçani, Stefani and Isai were also ordered to repay various sums to the state. On 30 November, the Court of Cassation reduced Alia&#x27;s term by an additional three years. On 7 July 1995, Ramiz Alia was freed from jail. However, his freedom was short-lived and in 1996 he was charged with committing crimes against humanity during his term, and was imprisoned anew in March. The trial against him began on 18 February 1997, but he escaped from the prison following the unrest in the country and the desertion of the guards. Amid the unrest he appeared on state TV in an exclusive interview with Blendi Fevziu. In December 1997 he returned to Albania after escaping briefly to France to join his family during the Albanian unrest. In the late 2000s, he was sometimes seen travelling to Albania from Dubai to give interviews or publicize his books.

==Death==
Alia died on October 7, 2011, in Tirana, Albania, 11 days before his 86th birthday.

== Legacy ==
Alia’s legacy remains polarizing with some dissidents accusing him of continuing on Hoxha’s repressive practices (such as the execution of dissidents in labor camps) while others have praised him for peacefully dissolving the monopolistic hold of power of the Party of Labour and avoiding bloodshed and civil war as seen in Romania previously. Some western observers compared Alia to Mikhail Gorbachev of the Soviet Union for his failed attempts at reforming the stagnant economy of Albania during his tenure.

<doc id="267916" wikidata="Q288189" url="?curid=267916" title="Nexhmije Hoxha">
<text>Nexhmije Hoxha (; ; 8 February 1921 – 26 February 2020) was an Albanian communist politician. She was the wife of Enver Hoxha, the first leader of the Socialist People&#x27;s Republic of Albania and the First Secretary of the Party of Labour of Albania. Very close to her husband, she attempted to remain politically influential after his death in 1985. She was one of the few spouses of a ruling communist party leader with a high political profile of her own.

==Biography==
Nexhmije Hoxha was born Nexhmije Xhuglini in Bitola, in present-day North Macedonia, then Yugoslavia. Later moving with her parents to the Albanian capital, Tirana, she studied at the Queen Mother Pedagogical Institute. In November 1941, while still training to be a schoolteacher, she joined the newly founded Communist Party of Albania and a year later was elected to the General Council of the Albanian National Liberation Movement. 

During the Second World War she fought against the forces of Fascist Italy and German Wehrmacht troops, as part of the First Division of the National Liberation Army, a resistance group which was dominated by communists and supported by Special Operations Executive forces which were sent to Albania by the British. In 1943 she was elected to the Secretariat of the Albanian Women&#x27;s League, and served as its chairwoman from 1946 to 1952, replacing Ollga Plumbi.

===Relationship with Enver Hoxha===
The then Nexhmije Xhuglini met Enver Hoxha at a meeting of the Albanian Party of Labour. Hoxha proposed to her in 1942 at a house which was being rented to him by the generous party supporter Syrja Selfo, who would be sentenced to death and executed in 1946. Then for the next several months, the Hoxhas stayed on and off in the house of Enver&#x27;s brother-in-law Bahri Omari, who was destined to be executed by a firing squad in 1945 for collaboration with Nazi occupation forces. They married in 1945. Enver Hoxha steadily rose to a prominent position after the end of the war and the establishment of a Communist government.

==Political career==
In 1966, as Albania increasingly isolated itself, she became director of the Institute of Marxist–Leninist Studies, a body which was responsible for ensuring ideological purity and spreading propaganda. Her relationship with the Sigurimi secret police is widely discussed. Nexhmije later claimed in her 1998 memoir, &quot;My Life with Enver&quot;, that her husband expressed some regrets over the number of executions which the Sigurimi carried out.

After her husband died in 1985, Nexhmije was elected chairwoman of the Democratic Front, an umbrella association, and she defended her husband&#x27;s heritage during the period of reforms (1990–1991). She was forced to resign as chairwoman of the Democratic Front in December 1990, and she was replaced by Prime Minister Adil Çarçani.

In the initial days after the Fall of communism in Albania, she described Ramiz Alia as a &quot;national traitor&quot;, but later recanted her statement, claiming that Alia and the entire Party of Labour of Albania only tried to save what could be saved of socialism, that he could not be described as a &quot;national traitor&quot; and that the original accusation came only out of personal anger and emotion.

==Later life and death==
She was expelled from APL on 13 June 1991 and the party organ Zeri i Popullit criticised her for her allegedly pompous way of life. She was arrested on 10 December 1991 and at the end of January 1993 she was sentenced to nine years in prison for embezzlement of 750,000 leks. The sentence was increased to eleven years by the appeal court. Hoxha was released from prison in January 1997.

Hoxha died on 26 February 2020 aged 99 at her home in Tirana from natural causes. At the time of her death she was the oldest living member of the communist leadership of Albania.

==Personal life==
For many years she lived with her husband in the section of Tirana which was known as the &quot;Bllok&quot;, reserved for the country&#x27;s ruling elite. However, Nexhmije maintained that she personally did not live extravagantly, emphasizing the prosaic nature of her marriage ceremony in 1945, which did not include a dress, a reception or a honeymoon.

<text>The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (, &quot;&quot;), also known by its Latin name as the , is a Greco-Roman periplus written in Koine Greek that describes navigation and trading opportunities from Roman Egyptian ports like Berenice Troglodytica along the coast of the Red Sea and others along the Horn of Africa, the Persian Gulf, Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean, including the modern-day Sindh region of Pakistan and southwestern regions of India.

The text has been ascribed to different dates between the first and third centuries, but a mid-first-century date is now the most commonly accepted. While the author is unknown, it is a first-hand description by someone familiar with the area and is nearly unique in providing accurate insights into what the ancient Hellenic world knew about the lands around the Indian Ocean.

==Name==

A periplus () is a logbook recording sailing itineraries and commercial, political, and ethnological details about the ports visited. In an era before maps were in general use, it functioned as a combination of atlas and traveller&#x27;s handbook.

The Erythraean Sea () was an ancient geographical designation that always included the Gulf of Aden between Arabia Felix and the Horn of Africa and was often extended (as in this periplus) to include the present-day Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and Indian Ocean as a single maritime area.

==Date and authorship==
The 10th-century Byzantine manuscript which forms the basis of present knowledge of the &quot;Periplus&quot; attributes the work to Arrian, but apparently for no better reason than its position beside Arrian&#x27;s much later &quot;Periplus of the Euxine Sea&quot;.

One historical analysis, published by Wilfred Harvey Schoff in 1912, narrowed the date of the text to AD5962, in agreement with present-day estimates of the middle of the 1st century. Schoff additionally provides a historical analysis as to the text&#x27;s original authorship, and arrives at the conclusion that the author was a &quot;Greek in Egypt, a Roman subject&quot;. By Schoff&#x27;s calculations, this would have been during the time of Tiberius Claudius Balbilus, who coincidentally also was an Egyptian Greek.

Schoff continues by noting that the author could not have been &quot;a highly educated man&quot; as &quot;is evident from his frequent confusion of Greek and Latin words and his clumsy and sometimes ungrammatical constructions&quot;. Because of &quot;the absence of any account of the journey up the Nile and across the desert from Coptos&quot;, Schoff prefers to pinpoint the author&#x27;s residence to &quot;Berenice rather than Alexandria&quot;.

John Hill maintains that &quot;the Periplus can now be confidently dated to between AD 40 and 70 and, probably, between AD 40 and 50.&quot; This dating corresponds with the argumentation of L. Casson (&quot;between A.D. 40 and 70&quot;) in his key book &quot;The Periplus Maris Erythraei: Text with Introduction, Translation and Commentary.

==Synopsis==

The work consists of 66 sections, most of them about the length of a long paragraph. For instance, the short section 9 reads in its entirety:
In many cases, the description of places is sufficiently accurate to identify their present locations; for others, there is considerable debate. For instance, &quot;Rhapta&quot; is mentioned as the farthest market down the African coast of &quot;Azania&quot;, but there are at least five locations matching the description, ranging from Tanga to south of the Rufiji River delta. The description of the Indian coast mentions the Ganges River clearly, yet after that it is ambiguous, describing China as a &quot;great inland city Thina&quot; that is a source of raw silk.

The &quot;Periplus&quot; says that a direct sailing route from the Red Sea to the Indian peninsula across the open ocean was discovered by Hippalus (1st centuryBC).

Many trade goods are mentioned in the &quot;Periplus&quot;, but some of the words naming trade goods are found nowhere else in ancient literature, leading to guesswork as to what they might be. For example, one trade good mentioned is &quot;lakkos chromatinos&quot;. The name &quot;lakkos&quot; appears nowhere else in ancient Greek or Roman literature. The name re-surfaces in late medieval Latin as &quot;lacca&quot;, borrowed from medieval Arabic &quot;lakk&quot; in turn borrowed from Sanskritic &quot;lakh&quot;, meaning lac i.e. a red-coloured resin native to India used as a lacquer and used also as a red colourant. Some other named trade goods remain obscure.

===Himyarite kingdom and Saba===
Ships from Himyar regularly travelled the East African coast. The &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; describes the trading empire of Himyar and Saba, regrouped under a single ruler, &quot;Charibael&quot; (probably Karab&#x27;il Watar Yuhan&#x27;em II), who is said to have been on friendly terms with Rome:

===Frankincense kingdom===
The Frankincense kingdom is described further east along the southern coast of the Arabian Peninsula, with the harbour of Cana (South Arabic &quot;Qana&quot;, modern Bi&#x27;r Ali in Hadramaut). The ruler of this kingdom is named Eleazus, or Eleazar, thought to correspond to King Iliazz Yalit I:

===Somalia===

Ras Hafun in northern Somalia is believed to be the location of the ancient trade centre of Opōnē. Ancient Egyptian, Roman and Persian Gulf pottery has been recovered from the site by an archaeological team from the University of Michigan. Opōnē is in the thirteenth entry of the &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot;, which in part states:

In ancient times, Opōnē operated as a port of call for merchants from Phoenicia, ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, Persia, Yemen, Nabataea, Azania, the Roman Empire, and elsewhere, as it possessed a strategic location along the coastal route from Azania to the Red Sea. Merchants from as far afield as Indonesia and Malaysia passed through Opōnē, trading spices, silks and other goods, before departing south for Azania or north to South Arabia or Egypt on the trade routes that spanned the length of the Indian Ocean&#x27;s rim. As early as AD50, Opōnē was well known as a center for the cinnamon trade, along with the trading of cloves and other spices, ivory, exotic animal skins and incense.

The ancient port city of Malao, situated in present-day Berbera in northern Somalia, is also mentioned in the Periplus:
===Aksum Empire===

Aksum is mentioned in the &quot;Periplus&quot; as an important market place for ivory, which was exported throughout the ancient world:

According to the &quot;Periplus&quot;, the ruler of Aksum was Zoscales, who, besides ruling in Aksum also held under his sway two harbours on the Red Sea: Adulis (near Massawa) and Avalites (Assab). He is also said to have been familiar with Greek literature:

===Rhapta===
====Rufiji (Tanzania) theory====
Research by the Tanzanian archaeologist Felix A. Chami has uncovered remains of Roman trade items near the mouth of the Rufiji River and the nearby Mafia island, and makes a case that the ancient port of Rhapta was situated on the banks of the Rufiji River just south of Dar es Salaam.

The &quot;Periplus&quot; informs us that:

Chami summarizes the evidence for Rhapta&#x27;s location as follows:
Felix Chami has found archaeological evidence for extensive Roman trade on Mafia Island and, not far away, on the mainland, near the mouth of the Rufiji River, which he dated to the first few centuries. Furthermore, J. Innes Miller points out that Roman coins have been found on Pemba island, just north of Rhapta.

====Quelimane (Mozambique) theory====
Nevertheless, Carl Peters has argued that Rhapta was near modern-day Quelimane in Mozambique, citing the fact that (according to the &quot;Periplus&quot;) the coastline there ran down towards the southwest. Peters also suggests that the description of the &quot;Pyralaoi&quot; (i.e., the &quot;Fire people&quot;) – &quot;situated at the entry to the [Mozambique] Channel&quot; – indicates that they were the inhabitants of the volcanic Comoro Islands. He also maintains that Menuthias (with its abundance of rivers and crocodiles) cannot have been Zanzibar; i.e., Madagascar seems more likely.

====Himyaro-Sabaean suzerainty====
The &quot;Periplus&quot; informs us that Rhapta, was under the firm control of a governor appointed by Arabian king of Musa, taxes were collected, and it was serviced by &quot;merchant craft that they staff mostly with Arab skippers and agents who, through continual intercourse and intermarriage, are familiar with the area and its language&quot;.

The Periplus explicitly states that Azania (which included Rhapta) was subject to &quot;Charibael&quot;, the king of both the Sabaeans and Homerites in the southwest corner of Arabia. The kingdom is known to have been a Roman ally at this period. Charibael is stated in the Periplus to be &quot;a friend of the (Roman) emperors, thanks to continuous embassies and gifts&quot; and, therefore, Azania could fairly be described as a vassal or dependency of Rome, just as Zesan is described in the 3rd-century Chinese history, the &quot;Weilüe&quot;.

===Bharuch===
Trade with the Indian harbour of Barygaza is described extensively in the &quot;Periplus&quot;. Nahapana, ruler of the Indo-Scythian Western Satraps is mentioned under the name &quot;Nambanus&quot;, as ruler of the area around Barigaza:

Under the Western Satraps, Barigaza was one of the main centres of Roman trade in the subcontinent. The &quot;Periplus&quot; describes the many goods exchanged:

Goods were also brought down in quantity from Ujjain, the capital of the Western Satraps:

===Early Chera, Pandyan, and Chola kingdoms===
The lost port city of Muziris (near present day Kodungallur) in the Chera kingdom, as well as the Early Pandyan Kingdom are mentioned in the &quot;Periplus&quot; as major centres of trade, pepper and other spices, metal work and semiprecious stones, between Damirica and the Roman Empire.

According to the &quot;Periplus&quot;, numerous Greek seamen managed an intense trade with Muziris:
According to the &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; (53:17:15-27), Limyrike began at Naura and Tyndis; Ptolemy (7.1.8) mentions only Tyndis as its starting point. The region probably ended at Kanyakumari; it thus roughly corresponds to the present-day Malabar Coast. Further, this area served as a hub for trade with the interior, in the Gangetic plain:
===Indian–Chinese border===
The &quot;Periplus&quot; also describes the annual fair in present-day Northeast India, on the border with China.
Sêsatai are the source of &quot;malabathron&quot;. Schoff&#x27;s translation mentions them as &quot;Besatae&quot;: they are a people similar to Kirradai and they lived in the region between &quot;Assam and Sichuan&quot;.

===Remains of the Indo-Greek kingdom===
The &quot;Periplus&quot; claims that Greek buildings and wells exist in Barigaza, falsely attributing them to Alexander the Great, who never went this far south. This account of a kingdom tracing its beginnings to Alexander&#x27;s campaigns and the Hellenistic Seleucid empire that followed:
The &quot;Periplus&quot; further claims to the circulation of Indo-Greek coinage in the region:
The Greek city of Alexandria Bucephalous on the Jhelum River is mentioned in the &quot;Periplus&quot;, as well as in the Roman Peutinger Table:

== Manuscripts ==
The &quot;Periplus&quot; was originally known only through a single manuscript dating from the 14th or 15th century, now held by the British Library. This manuscript proved to be a corrupt and error-ridden copy of a 10th-century Byzantine manuscript in minuscule hand. The 10th-century manuscript placed it beside Arrian&#x27;s &quot;Periplus of the Euxine Sea&quot; and (apparently mistakenly) also credited Arrian with writing it as well. The Byzantine manuscript was taken from Heidelberg to Rome during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648), then to Paris under Napoleon after his army&#x27;s conquest of the Papal States in the late 1790s, then returned to Heidelberg&#x27;s University Library in 1816 where it remains.

==Editions==
The British manuscript was edited by Sigmund Gelen () in Prague and first published by Hieronymus Froben in 1533. This error-ridden text served as the basis for other editions and translations for three centuries, until the restoration of the original manuscript to Heidelberg in 1816.

Schoff&#x27;s heavily annotated 1912 English translation was itself based on a defective original; as late as the 1960s, the only trustworthy scholarly edition was Frisk&#x27;s 1927 French study.

<text>Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), also known as gamma-seminoprotein or kallikrein-3 (KLK3), P-30 antigen, is a glycoprotein enzyme encoded in humans by the &quot;KLK3&quot; gene. PSA is a member of the kallikrein-related peptidase family and is secreted by the epithelial cells of the prostate gland in men and the paraurethral glands in women.

PSA is produced for the ejaculate, where it liquefies semen in the seminal coagulum and allows sperm to swim freely. It is also believed to be instrumental in dissolving cervical mucus, allowing the entry of sperm into the uterus.

PSA is present in small quantities in the serum of men with healthy prostates, but is often elevated in the presence of prostate cancer or other prostate disorders. PSA is not uniquely an indicator of prostate cancer, but may also detect prostatitis or benign prostatic hyperplasia.

==Medical diagnostic uses==

===Prostate cancer===

====Screening====
Clinical practice guidelines for prostate cancer screening vary and are controversial, in part due to uncertainty as to whether the benefits of screening ultimately outweigh the risks of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the PSA test for annual screening of prostate cancer in men of age 50 and older. The patient is required to be informed of the risks and benefits of PSA testing prior to performing the test.

In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service (NHS) does not mandate, nor advise for PSA test, but allows patients to decide based on their doctor&#x27;s advice. The NHS does not offer general PSA screening, for similar reasons.

PSA levels between 4 and 10ng/mL (nanograms per milliliter) are considered to be suspicious, and consideration should be given to confirming the abnormal PSA with a repeat test. If indicated, prostate biopsy is performed to obtain a tissue sample for histopathological analysis. 

While PSA testing may help 1 in 1,000 avoid death due to prostate cancer, 4 to 5 in 1,000 would die from prostate cancer after 10 years even with screening. This means that PSA screening may reduce mortality from prostate cancer by up to 25%. Expected harms include anxiety for 100–120 receiving false positives, biopsy pain, and other complications from biopsy for false positive tests.

Use of PSA screening tests is also controversial due to questionable test accuracy. The screening can present abnormal results even when a man does not have cancer (known as a false-positive result), or normal results even when a man does have cancer (known as a false-negative result). False-positive test results can cause confusion and anxiety in men, and can lead to unnecessary prostate biopsies, a procedure which causes risk of pain, infection, and hemorrhage. False-negative results can give men a false sense of security, though they may actually have cancer.

Of those found to have prostate cancer, overtreatment is common because most cases of prostate cancer are not expected to cause any symptoms due to low rate of growth of the prostate tumor. Therefore, many will experience the side effects of treatment, such as for every 1000 men screened, 29 will experience erectile dysfunction, 18 will develop urinary incontinence, two will have serious cardiovascular events, one will develop pulmonary embolus or deep venous thrombosis, and one perioperative death. Since the expected harms relative to risk of death are perceived by patients as minimal, men found to have prostate cancer usually (up to 90% of cases) elect to receive treatment.

====Risk stratification and staging====

Men with prostate cancer may be characterized as low, intermediate, or high risk for having/developing metastatic disease or dying of prostate cancer. PSA level is one of three variables on which the risk stratification is based; the others are the grade of prostate cancer (Gleason grading system) and the stage of cancer based on physical examination and imaging studies. D&#x27;Amico criteria for each risk category are:
:Low risk: PSA &lt; 10, Gleason score ≤ 6, AND clinical stage ≤ T2a
:Intermediate risk: PSA 10-20, Gleason score 7, OR clinical stage T2b/c
:High risk: PSA &gt; 20, Gleason score ≥ 8, OR clinical stage ≥ T3
Given the relative simplicity of the 1998 D&#x27;Amico criteria (above), other predictive models of risk stratification based on mathematical probability constructs exist or have been proposed to allow for better matching of treatment decisions with disease features.
Studies are being conducted into the incorporation of multiparametric MRI imaging results into nomograms that rely on PSA, Gleason grade, and tumor stage.

====Post-treatment monitoring====

PSA levels are monitored periodically (e.g., every 6–36 months) after treatment for prostate cancer – more frequently in patients with high-risk disease, less frequently in patients with lower-risk disease. If surgical therapy (i.e., radical prostatectomy) is successful at removing all prostate tissue (and prostate cancer), PSA becomes undetectable within a few weeks. A subsequent rise in PSA level above 0.2ng/mL L is generally regarded as evidence of recurrent prostate cancer after a radical prostatectomy; less commonly, it may simply indicate residual benign prostate tissue.

Following radiation therapy of any type for prostate cancer, some PSA levels might be detected, even when the treatment ultimately proves to be successful. This makes interpreting the relationship between PSA levels and recurrence/persistence of prostate cancer after radiation therapy more difficult. PSA levels may continue to decrease for several years after radiation therapy. The lowest level is referred to as the PSA nadir. A subsequent increase in PSA levels by 2.0ng/mL above the nadir is the currently accepted definition of prostate cancer recurrence after radiation therapy.

Recurrent prostate cancer detected by a rise in PSA levels after curative treatment is referred to as a &quot;biochemical recurrence&quot;. The likelihood of developing recurrent prostate cancer after curative treatment is related to the pre-operative variables described in the preceding section (PSA level and grade/stage of cancer). Low-risk cancers are the least likely to recur, but they are also the least likely to have required treatment in the first place.

===Prostatitis===

PSA levels increase in the setting of prostate infection/inflammation (prostatitis), often markedly (&gt; 100).

==Forensic identification of semen==

PSA was first identified by researchers attempting to find a substance in seminal fluid that would aid in the investigation of rape cases. PSA is used to indicate the presence of semen in forensic serology. The semen of adult males has PSA levels far in excess of those found in other tissues; therefore, a high level of PSA found in a sample is an indicator that semen may be present. Because PSA is a biomarker that is expressed independently of spermatozoa, it remains useful in identifying semen from vasectomized and azoospermic males.

PSA can also be found at low levels in other body fluids, such as urine and breast milk, thus setting a high minimum threshold of interpretation to rule out false positive results and conclusively state that semen is present. While traditional tests such as crossover electrophoresis have a sufficiently low sensitivity to detect only seminal PSA, newer diagnostics tests developed from clinical prostate cancer screening methods have lowered the threshold of detection down to 4ng/mL. This level of antigen has been shown to be present in the peripheral blood of males with prostate cancer, and rarely in female urine samples and breast milk.

==Sources==

PSA is produced in the epithelial cells of the prostate, and can be demonstrated in biopsy samples or other histological specimens using immunohistochemistry. Disruption of this epithelium, for example in inflammation or benign prostatic hyperplasia, may lead to some diffusion of the antigen into the tissue around the epithelium, and is the cause of elevated blood levels of PSA in these conditions.

More significantly, PSA remains present in prostate cells after they become malignant. Prostate cancer cells generally have variable or weak staining for PSA, due to the disruption of their normal functioning. Thus, individual prostate cancer cells produce less PSA than healthy cells; the raised serum levels in prostate cancer patients is due to the greatly increased number of such cells, not their individual activity. In most cases of prostate cancer, though, the cells remain positive for the antigen, which can then be used to identify metastasis. Since some high-grade prostate cancers may be entirely negative for PSA, however, histological analysis to identify such cases usually uses PSA in combination with other antibodies, such as prostatic acid phosphatase and &quot;CD57&quot;.

==Mechanism of action==

The physiological function of KLK3 is the dissolution of the coagulum, the sperm-entrapping gel composed of semenogelins and fibronectin. Its proteolytic action is effective in liquefying the coagulum so that the sperm can be liberated. The activity of PSA is well regulated. In the prostate, it is present as an inactive pro-form, which is activated through the action of KLK2, another kallikrein-related peptidase. In the prostate, zinc ion concentrations are 10 times higher than in other bodily fluids. Zinc ions have a strong inhibitory effect on the activity of PSA and on that of KLK2, so that PSA is totally inactive.

Further regulation is achieved through pH variations. Although its activity is increased by higher pH, the inhibitory effect of zinc also increases. The pH of semen is slightly alkaline and the concentrations of zinc are high. On ejaculation, semen is exposed to the acidic pH of the vagina, due to the presence of lactic acid. In fertile couples, the final vaginal pH after coitus approaches the 6-7 levels, which coincides well with reduced zinc inhibition of PSA. At these pH levels, the reduced PSA activity is countered by a decrease in zinc inhibition. Thus, the coagulum is slowly liquefied, releasing the sperm in a well-regulated manner.

==Biochemistry==

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA, also known as kallikrein III, seminin, semenogelase, γ-seminoprotein and P-30 antigen) is a 34-kD glycoprotein produced almost exclusively by the prostate gland. It is a serine protease () enzyme, the gene of which is located on the 19th chromosome (19q13) in humans.

==History==

The discovery of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is beset with controversy; as PSA is present in prostatic tissue and semen, it was independently discovered and given different names, thus adding to the controversy.

Flocks was the first to experiment with antigens in the prostate and 10 years later Ablin reported the presence of precipitation antigens in the prostate.

In 1971, Mitsuwo Hara characterized a unique protein in the semen fluid, gamma-seminoprotein. Li and Beling, in 1973, isolated a protein, E1, from human semen in an attempt to find a novel method to achieve fertility control.

In 1978, Sensabaugh identified semen-specific protein p30, but proved that it was similar to E1 protein, and that prostate was the source. In 1979, Wang purified a tissue-specific antigen from the prostate (&#x27;prostate antigen&#x27;).

PSA was first measured quantitatively in the blood by Papsidero in 1980, and Stamey carried out the initial work on the clinical use of PSA as a marker of prostate cancer.

==Serum levels==

PSA is normally present in the blood at very low levels. The reference range of less than 4ng/mL for the first commercial PSA test, the Hybritech Tandem-R PSA test released in February 1986, was based on a study that found 99% of 472 apparently healthy men had a total PSA level below 4ng/mL.

Increased levels of PSA may suggest the presence of prostate cancer. However, prostate cancer can also be present in the complete absence of an elevated PSA level, in which case the test result would be a false negative.

Obesity has been reported to reduce serum PSA levels. Delayed early detection may partially explain worse outcomes in obese men with early prostate cancer. After treatment, higher BMI also correlates to higher risk of recurrence.

PSA levels can be also increased by prostatitis, irritation, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and recent ejaculation, producing a false positive result. Digital rectal examination (DRE) has been shown in several studies to produce an increase in PSA. However, the effect is clinically insignificant, since DRE causes the most substantial increases in patients with PSA levels already elevated over 4.0ng/mL. PSA levels are higher during the summer than during the rest of the year.

The &quot;normal&quot; reference ranges for prostate-specific antigen increase with age, as do the usual ranges in cancer (per associated table).

===PSA velocity===

Despite earlier findings, recent research suggests that the rate of increase of PSA (e.g. &gt;0.35ng/mL/yr, the &#x27;PSA velocity&#x27;) is not a more specific marker for prostate cancer than the serum level of PSA.

However, the PSA rate of rise may have value in prostate cancer prognosis. Men with prostate cancer whose PSA level increased by more than 2.0ng per milliliter during the year before the diagnosis of prostate cancer have a higher risk of death from prostate cancer despite undergoing radical prostatectomy. PSA velocity (PSAV) was found in a 2008 study to be more useful than the PSA doubling time (PSA DT) to help identify those men with life-threatening disease before start of treatment.

Men who are known to be at risk for prostate cancer, and who decide to plot their PSA values as a function of time (i.e., years), may choose to use a semi-log plot. An exponential growth in PSA values appears as a straight line on a semi-log plot, so that a new PSA value significantly above the straight line signals a &quot;switch&quot; to a new and significantly higher growth rate, i.e., a higher PSA velocity.

===Free PSA===
Most PSA in the blood is bound to serum proteins. A small amount is not protein-bound and is called &#x27;free PSA&#x27;. In men with prostate cancer, the ratio of free (unbound) PSA to total PSA is decreased. The risk of cancer increases if the free to total ratio is less than 25%. (See graph) The lower the ratio is, the greater the probability of prostate cancer. Measuring the ratio of free to total PSA appears to be particularly promising for eliminating unnecessary biopsies in men with PSA levels between 4 and 10ng/mL. However, both total and free PSA increase immediately after ejaculation, returning slowly to baseline levels within 24 hours.

===Inactive PSA===

The PSA test in 1994 failed to differentiate between prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and the commercial assay kits for PSA did not provide correct PSA values. Thus with the introduction of the ratio of free-to-total PSA, the reliability of the test has improved. Measuring the activity of the enzyme could add to the ratio of free-to-total PSA and further improve the diagnostic value of test. Proteolytically active PSA has been shown to have an anti-angiogenic effect and certain inactive subforms may be associated with prostate cancer, as shown by MAb 5D3D11, an antibody able to detect forms abundantly represented in sera from cancer patients.
The presence of inactive proenzyme forms of PSA is another potential indicator of disease.

===Complexed PSA===

PSA exists in serum in the free (unbound) form and in a complex with alpha 1-antichymotrypsin; research has been conducted to see if measurements of complexed PSA are more specific and sensitive biomarkers for prostate cancer than other approaches.

==PSA in other biologic fluids and tissues==
The term prostate-specific antigen is a misnomer: it is an antigen but is not specific to the prostate. Although present in large amounts in prostatic tissue and semen, it has been detected in other body fluids and tissues.

In women, PSA is found in female ejaculate at concentrations roughly equal to that found in male semen. Other than semen and female ejaculate, the greatest concentrations of PSA in biological fluids are detected in breast milk and amniotic fluid. Low concentrations of PSA have been identified in the urethral glands, endometrium, normal breast tissue and salivary gland tissue. PSA also is found in the serum of women with breast, lung, or uterine cancer and in some patients with renal cancer.

Tissue samples can be stained for the presence of PSA in order to determine the origin of malignant cells that have metastasized.

== Interactions ==

Prostate-specific antigen has been shown to interact with protein C inhibitor.
Prostate-specific antigen interacts with and activates the vascular endothelial growth factors VEGF-C and VEGF-D, which are involved in tumor angiogenesis and in the lymphatic metastasis of tumors.

<text>The Eurylaimidae are a family of suboscine passerine birds that occur from the eastern Himalayas to Indonesia and the Philippines. 
The family previously included the sapayoa from the Neotropics, the asities from Madagascar, and the Calyptomenidae from Africa and Asia, but these are now separated into distinct families.

==Description==
Many of the species are brightly coloured birds that present broad heads, large eyes and a hooked, flat and broad beak. They range from 13 to 28 centimetres in length, and live in the dense canopies of wet forests, allowing them to hide despite their brightly coloured plumage. The plumage of the juvenile eurylaimids are similar to those of the adults, differing in being duller and shorter-winged and shorter-tailed in some cases.

==Behaviour and ecology==
They are for the most part insectivorous and carnivorous. Prey taken includes insects, spiders, centipedes, and millipedes, as well as lizards and tree frogs. Prey is obtained by sallying from a perch to snatch it in flight, and gleaning the prey off leaves and branches while flying. Some species may take some fruit, but only the green broadbills of the genus &quot;Calyptomena&quot; and the Grauer&#x27;s broadbill are primarily frugivores (which also take some insects).

They are generally gregarious, with many species moving about in flocks of about 20 individuals. They attach their purse-shaped nests to suspended vines, and leave a tail of fibres hanging below it. This gives the nest the appearance of being random debris caught in the tree, an effect further enhanced by the birds covering the nest with lichen and spider webs. Broadbills typically lay two to three eggs.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The family Eurylaimidae was introduced in 1831 (as Eurylaimes) by the French naturalist René Lesson. They were characterized by a simple syrinx with just a single pair of muscles, the front toes being partially fused at the base and having 15 neck vertebrae. A DNA sequence-based study by Carl Oliveros and colleagues published in 2019 determined the phylogenetic relationships of the Eurylaimidae to other families in the Eurylaimides (Old World suboscines):
A study published in 2017 determined the following phylogenetic relationships among the Eurylaimidae:
The family includes ten species of which four are each placed in their own monotypic genus:

<doc id="267928" wikidata="Q1322497" url="?curid=267928" title="Nagoya Airfield">
<text>, also known as Komaki Airport or Nagoya Airport, is an airport within the local government areas of Toyoyama, Komaki, Kasugai and Nagoya in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. Prior to 2005 it was an international airport, but is now a domestic secondary airport serving Nagoya while the current primary civil airport for Nagoya is Chūbu Centrair International Airport in Tokoname.

It is the main operating base for FDA (Fuji Dream Airlines), the only airline that offers scheduled air service from the airfield. It is also used for general aviation and, by Japan Self-Defense Forces, as an airbase.

Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation is headquartered in the airport&#x27;s terminal building, and its parent company Mitsubishi Heavy Industries produced the Mitsubishi Regional Jet aircraft at a factory adjacent to the airport.

==Alternate names==
* &quot;Nagoya Airfield&quot; is the name as the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of the national government, as of 2008, recognizes it as an &quot;other airport&quot;.
* The airfield was until the opening of Centrair on February 17, 2005.
* It has been conventionally called .
* Aichi Prefectural Government, the current owner of the airport, nicknames it .
* The Japan Self-Defense Forces shares the runway as a part of . The four Boeing KC-767J tankers of the 404th Tactical Airlift Tanker Squadron are based there.

==History==
Nagoya Airport served as the main airport for Nagoya until the opening of Chubu Centrair International Airport on February 17, 2005. This airport IATA Airport Code used to be NGO (now overtaken by the new Centrair airport), and its ICAO Airport Code used to be RJNN when it was classified as a second class airport; the new designations are NKM for regional flights and RJNA designation for general aviation flights. Aichi Prefecture manages the facilities and regularly handles international business flights.

During the 1980s and early 1990s, Nagoya Airport was a busy international airport because of overflow from Japan&#x27;s other international airports, New Tokyo International Airport (now Narita International Airport) near Tokyo and Osaka International Airport (Itami Airport) near Osaka.

Since the opening of Kansai International Airport in 1994, the airport&#x27;s main traffic source has been the nearby automotive and manufacturing industries, causing carriers such as United Airlines (San Francisco and Chicago–O&#x27;Hare) (United, as successor to Continental Airlines, currently serves Centrair Airport with flights to Guam) and Delta Air Lines (Portland (OR)) (Delta, as successor to Northwest Airlines, currently serves Centrair Airport with flights to Detroit) to stop flying to Nagoya. Some discount holiday flights still operated from Nagoya, drawing passengers from the Kansai region.
On the other hand, the cargo handling capacity of Nagoya Airport was not enough to satisfy the demands from the regional economy and air cargo shifted to Narita and Kansai.
In addition, the airport was hampered by its location in a residential area of Aichi Prefecture, limiting the number of flights that can use the airport, as well as the hours in which they can fly.

Because of these reasons, a new airport, Chubu Centrair International Airport, was built on an island south of Nagoya. On February 17, 2005, nearly all of Nagoya Airport&#x27;s commercial transport flights moved to Centrair. On the same day, the old airport became a general aviation and airbase facility, as well as was renamed to the current names. It also became J-AIR&#x27;s headquarters after a hub relocation from Hiroshima-Nishi Airport. The airline continued to operate through the airport until Fuji Dream Airlines opened a base at the airport and a corporate restructuring of its parent company Japan Airlines in 2010 resulted in J-Air&#x27;s departure from the airport and moving of its operation base to Itami Airport in Osaka. A dedicated business aviation terminal and commuter flights within Japan then became the key features of Nagoya&#x27;s secondary airport. The Aichi Museum of Flight opened at the airport in November 2017.

===Military use===
====Imperial Period====
Nagoya Airport was first opened in 1944 as a military airport named Kamake Airfield. It was primarily used as the home base of the 55th &quot;Sentai&quot; of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service. As such, it was attacked on several occasions during the Pacific War in 1944 and 1945 by USAAF B-29 Superfortress bombing raids.

====U.S. period====
After the end of World War II, the airfield was taken over by the American occupation forces and renamed Nagoya Air Base. Reconstruction of the heavily damaged airfield began and in May 1946, Nagoya became the headquarters of the Fifth Air Force, which controlled Air Force occupation units throughout Japan. In December 1950 during the Korean War, Fifth Air Force headquarters was moved to South Korea; however, it returned to Nagoya Air Base in September 1954 and remained until July 1957 when it moved to Fuchu Air Station in Tokyo as part of the USAF return of Nagoya Airport to Japanese control.

The U.S. primarily used Nagoya Air Base as a headquarters station for the next ten years, stationing several command and control units at the base:
* 308th Bombardment Wing, 1 Mar 1947-30 Jun 1948
: Moved to Nagoya in March from Kimpo Air Base, South Korea where it had been performing occupation duty since moving there from Okinawa in September 1945

* 85th Fighter Wing, 1 Jun 1947-30 Jun 1948
: Moved from the Philippines to set up an air defense organization in Japan.

* 314th Air Division, 1 Dec 1950-1 Mar 1952
: Activated at Nagoya. During the Korean War it assumed the missions of airfield construction and defense of Japan as well as providing logistical support for the Fifth Air Force.

Operational use from the airfield began in February 1947 when the 347th Fighter Group (All Weather) began operating P-61 Black Widow interceptor aircraft, which were used to provide air defense for Japan. It operated from the airfield until June 1950 when the Black Widows were retired and the unit was inactivated.

After the Armistice in South Korea which ended combat, the 49th Fighter Group moved to Nagoya Air Base with F-84 Thunderjets. The unit provided air defense until June 1957 when it moved to Misawa Air Base.

The 6110th Air Base Group, which had maintained the base and the myriad of ground support units at the base since the Americans moved in during 1946 began phasing down after July 1957. The 6110th USAF Hospital remained open until 30 June 1958 when the last Americans left Nagoya Airfield and it was returned to Japanese control.

====Japan Self-Defense Force====
In 2009 the first dedicated air-to-air refueling squadron of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force was formed at Komaki. Named the 404th Tactical Airlift Tanker Squadron, it is equipped with Boeing KC-767J aircraft.

==Statistics==
==Incidents and accidents==
*On April 26, 1994, an Airbus A300B4-622R jet operating as China Airlines Flight 140 (B-1816) from Taipei to Nagoya crashed onto the south-east corner of the airport apron whilst trying to land on Runway 34, killing 264 of the 271 people on board. It is the second deadliest crash on Japanese soil, after Japan Air Lines Flight 123.
*On October 31, 2007, a Mitsubishi F-2 fighter jet, whilst on a test flight, crashed and exploded in flames during takeoff. Both pilots survived the incident with minor injuries.
*On May 30, 2015, &quot;Solar Impulse 2&quot;, part of a Swiss long-range experimental solar-powered aircraft project, made an emergency landing after diverting due to weather en route from Nanjing Lukou International Airport in China to Kalaeloa Airport in Hawaii; it continued to Hawaii on 28 June.

==Tenant squadrons==
* Japan Air Self-Defense Force
** 401st Tactical Airlift Squadron (Lockheed C-130H/KC-130H)
** 404th Tactical Airlift Tanker Squadron (Boeing KC-767J)(2009–)

<doc id="267929" wikidata="Q57625" url="?curid=267929" title="Sali Berisha">
<text>Sali Ram Berisha (; born 15 October 1944) is an Albanian cardiologist and conservative politician who served as the president of Albania from 1992 to 1997 and as the 32nd prime minister of Albania from 2005 to 2013. Berisha has served as Chairman of the Democratic Party of Albania since 2022. He has previously held the position of chairman from 1990 to 1992 and 1997 to 2013. He is the leader of opposition in Albania.

He has been barred from entering the United States and the United Kingdom, being accused of &quot;involvement in significant corruption&quot; and links to organised crime groups and criminals that pose a &quot;risk to public safety in Albania&quot;.

On 9 September 2021, Berisha was expelled by party chairman Lulzim Basha from the Democratic Party&#x27;s Parliamentary Group due to legal issues with the US Department of State. This decision led to 79-year-old Berisha starting a nation-wide movement to remove Basha as leader of the Democratic Party, causing a major rift in the party&#x27;s internal structures, between Berisha&#x27;s and Basha&#x27;s supporters.

On 30 December 2023, Berisha was placed under house arrest due to alleged corruption during his term as Prime Minister. He was released following a court order on 27 November 2024.

==Early life and career==

Berisha was born in Viçidol, then Tropojë District, in northern Albania, to a Muslim family of mountain farmers. His family belong to the Berisha tribe. As a child, he tended sheep.

After his father became a functionary of the Party of Labour of Albania, Berisha enjoyed a higher education and was then able to study medicine at the University of Tirana, graduating in 1967. With a one-year scholarship, he specialized in cardiology in Paris.

Subsequently, he was appointed as an assistant professor of medicine at the same university and as staff cardiologist at the Tirana General Hospital. At the same time, Berisha became a member of a discussion forum for changes in the Albanian Party of Labor while having been enrolled as a member a few years earlier. During the 1970s, Berisha gained distinction as the leading researcher in the field of cardiology in Albania and became professor of cardiology at the University of Tirana. In 1978 he received a United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural (UNESCO) fellowship for nine months of advanced study and training in Paris.

He also conducted a research program on hemodynamics that attracted considerable attention among his colleagues in Europe. In 1986 he was elected to be a member of the European Committee for Research on Medical Sciences.

In an interview for the Albanian Writers League newspaper published also in the international press, Berisha demanded that the remaining barriers to freedom of thought and expression be ended, that Albanians be granted the right to travel freely within the country and abroad, and that Albania abandon its isolationist foreign policy. At an August 1990 meeting of the nation&#x27;s intellectuals convened by President Ramiz Alia, Berisha urged the Albanian Party of Labor to abolish the third article of the communist constitution which sanctioned that the Party of Labor had the hegemony of the Power, to recognize the Human Rights Charter, the drafting of a new democratic constitution, and to remove all monuments of Stalin in the country.

In an article published in the &quot;Bashkimi&quot; newspaper on 17 September 1990, Berisha condemned what he termed the &quot;cosmetic reforms&quot; of the Alia regime, which had only served to aggravate unrest within the nation. Without political pluralism, he argued, there could be no true democracy in Albania.

Berisha emerged as the chairman of the Democratic Party of Albania (DP), the first and largest of the new opposition parties. All leading members of the party wore white coats during demonstrations. He was formally elected DP chairman in February 1991 at the party&#x27;s first national congress. He was elected member of Albania parliament in 1991, 1992, 1997, 2001 from the constituency of Kavajë.

==President (1992–1997)==
After the 1992 elections—the second free legislative elections held in the country—Berisha was elected president on 9 April 1992. He was the country&#x27;s second freely elected head of state, and the first non-Communist head of state in 53 years.

Following his election, Berisha and his government were engaged in a profound course of political, economic, institutional, legislative and multifaceted reforms. Therefore, the complete privatisation of land and residencies, as well as of all small and medium state enterprises, was accomplished over the period 1992–96; prices and exchange rates were fully liberalised, and Albania changed from a country of a three figure inflation rate and economic growth regression of −20% into a country with a one-figure inflation rate and with an average economic growth rate of 9% in 1992 and, in &#x27;93 – &#x27;96, 75% of GDP was generated from the private sector.

Albania opened towards the West: it signed the Partnership for Peace Agreement in 1994 and it became a member of the Council of Europe in 1995.

Berisha also introduced Islam to the Albanian political scene, pursued re-Islamisation of the country (approximately 74% Sunni Muslims of Albania&#x27;s population) to reverse decades of anti-religious policy under Communism. Nongovernmental organisations from Saudi Arabia and other parts of the Muslim world were invited in to build mosques and schools and provide other aid, and spread Wahhabi or Salafi Islam to Albania (and along with it, Saudi geopolitical influence).

The collapse of the Ponzi schemes towards the end of 1996, into which Albanians allegedly invested $1 billion worth of life savings from 1994, recapped the crisis. The schemes failed, one by one, from December 1996, and demonstrators took to the streets accusing the government of having stolen the money. In the midst of the crisis that had escalated into a civil war, Sali Berisha was re-elected president for a second five-year term on 3 March 1997 by a parliament totally controlled by the Democratic Party.

During the first ten days of March, the situation deteriorated, culminating in the desertion of large numbers of police and military, leaving their arsenals unlocked. These were promptly looted, mostly by militias and some criminal gangs, and for a time it looked like civil war would erupt between the government and rebels. Although the Prime Minister resigned immediately, Berisha refused opposition demands to step down, claiming he had to ensure continuity, and UN and European Multinational Forces were required to step in and take the situation under control. After their intervention in Albania, early elections were held in June 1997, leading to the victory of a socialist-led coalition of parties. On 23 July 1997, a month after the DP lost the 1997 elections to the left coalition, Berisha stepped down as president and was replaced by the socialist Rexhep Meidani. In 1997 he became the chairman of the Democratic Party, which became the biggest opposition party. He eventually returned to power as prime minister between 2005 and 2013.

==Opposition leader (1997–2005)==
The murder of DP MP Azem Hajdari on 12 September 1998, triggered two days of violent protests in Tirana. During Hajdari&#x27;s funeral procession on 14 September 1998, armed DP supporters ransacked government offices, and for a brief period, held the PM&#x27;s office, the parliament building, and the Albanian State television and radio building. Estimates of casualties during the protests and riots ranged between 3 and 7 deaths and 14 and 76 injuries. After 72 hours, the Government restored order and reclaimed tanks and armored personnel carriers seized by DP supporters that were being held at the Democratic Party main offices in Tirana. Parliament subsequently lifted Berisha&#x27;s immunity due to his alleged role in what the government described as a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, but no charges were laid. Berisha blamed the Socialist Party of Albania and its leaders for the murder. Twelve people were arrested for their alleged involvement in the violence. In February 2002 five people, including Jaho Mulosmani, were sentenced for the murder by a Tirana district court.

Sali Berisha led the coalition of the center-right parties in the general elections held in five rounds in June–August 2001.

In the winter of 2004, a number of protests with over 20,000 people were organized by the opposition led by Berisha demanding Nano resign as prime minister which became known as the &quot;Nano Go Away&quot; Movement (&quot;Levizja &quot;Nano Ik&quot;&quot;).

==Prime Minister (2005–2013)==

On 3 July 2005, Sali Berisha led a coalition of five right center parties into the 2005 parliamentary elections, which eventually won a majority of 74 MPs from a total of 140. He was appointed Prime Minister of Albania on 8 September 2005.

On 10 June 2007, Berisha met with U.S. President George W. Bush in Tirana. Bush became the first U.S. president to visit Albania and repeated his staunch support for the independence of neighbouring Kosovo from Serbia: &quot;At some point in time, sooner rather than later, you&#x27;ve got to say, enough is enough. Kosovo is independent.&quot;
On 15 March 2008, Berisha faced the toughest challenge of his government when an ammunition dump exploded in the village of Gërdec near Tirana, killing 26 people and injuring over 100. Defense Minister Fatmir Mediu resigned, and the press reported many irregularities at the blast site, operated by an Albanian company that deactivated the country&#x27;s aging ammunition and then sold it for scrap.
In June 2009, Democrats declared a narrow win in the parliamentary elections.
Berisha&#x27;s alliance came up one seat short of a majority and had to join forces with a splinter socialist party, the Socialist Movement for Integration of Ilir Meta, in order to retain power. Berisha appointed Meta to the post of deputy prime minister and at the same time Minister for Foreign Affairs, and later Minister of Economy, Trade and Energy. It was the first time since the start of multi-party democracy in 1991 that a ruling party had been forced into a coalition due to not winning enough seats on its own.

The 2009 elections were called flawed by the socialist opposition, which asked for a recount of the ballots. Berisha refused, on the ground that the Albanian Constitution does not call for such a procedure. He however called the opposition to the Parliament to change the Constitution, but the Socialist Party refused. The political crisis between government and opposition worsened over time, with the Socialists abandoning parliamentary debates for months and staging hunger strikes to ask for internal and international support. The EU attempted a conciliation, which failed. The ongoing political crisis was one of the reasons for the EU&#x27;s refusal to grant Albania official candidate status in late 2010. However, The elections were certified by the OSCE/ODIHR as having marked significant progress in voter registration, the identification process, the legal framework, the voting process, the counting of votes and the resolution of complaints.

In 2009 during the government led by Berisha, more than 10,000 km of roads were built, connecting over 900 villages with the municipalities and 169 municipalities with the national road infrastructure with paved roads. To be mentioned are the Tirana-Elbasan road and, in particular, the Durrës-Kukës road, otherwise known as the &quot;Nation Road&quot;, because it connected neighboring Kosovo with the city of Durrës. The latter crosses Albania from east to west and is the largest road project in the history of Albania. The construction of this road was criticized by the Socialist Party.

On 21 January 2011, clashes broke out between police and protesters in an anti-government rally in front of the Government building in Tirana. Four people were shot dead by government special forces. The EU issued a statement to Albanian politicians, warning both sides to refrain from violence, while Berisha called the protests and subsequent charges by judges upon policemen as stages of an attempted coup against him – consequently, he attempted to consolidate his grip on state institutions. He accused the then-President of having been part of the coup after relations had soured between the two, and embraced his perceived victim status to install his own &#x27;yes man&#x27; in the office.

In 2011, commenting on the Middle East, Berisha said: &quot;Peace between Israel and the Palestinians must go through direct negotiations, and by guaranteeing the security of both states... The solution must bring full security to both states, but I have not seen any support for the acceptance and recognition of the State of Israel.&quot;

Under his leadership, Albania made several strides in sustainable development. In the 2012 Environmental Performance Index, the country ranked 4th out of 132 countries, while maintaining an average GDP growth of 5.1% between 2007 and 2011. By 2012, the country was producing more than 96 percent of the energy through renewable hydropower resources. For his significant achievements and contributions to sustainable development, he was awarded the Fray International Sustainability Award in 2012.

After his party&#x27;s defeat in the 2013 parliamentary election, Berisha resigned as party leader, but remained in parliament.

== Opposition leader (2022–present) ==
Following the decision of Lulzim Basha in expelling Berisha from the Democratic Party parliamentary group. Prior to this, members of the Democratic Party who had been also unsettled with Basha over election results following two consecutive losses in parliament. Calling for him Basha to resign. However Basha was not willing to resign. On 9 September 2021, Basha had expelled Berisha from the Democratic party due to issues concerning the United States and Berisha and his Public Designation by the United States Department of State. On 11 December at Arena Kombëtare, Berisha and members who were against Basha during the national council voted to remove Basha as leader of the Democratic Party. On 8 January 2021, Berisha and members of the Democratic party who were against Basha staged protests outside the Democratic Party headquarters which resulted in the RENEA being called in due to the protests becoming violent.

On 21 March 2022, due to demand Lulzim Basha stepped down from party leadership which resulted in Berisha being elected. However, despite Enkelejd Alibeaj claiming he is the official leader of the Democratic Party, Berisha is considered the &quot;de facto&quot; leader. As de facto leader, on 7 July 2022, he staged protests against the Albanian government over prices and wages in front of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office. Berisha also stated that the future of Albania and the Albanians was at risk and the people should decide in their own hands.

On 6 December 2022 during protests Berisha was assaulted in the face resulting in him being given a black eye. The assailant&#x27;s mother had told the media that her son had been suffering from mental problems for 5 years. He is awaiting trial. President Begaj, Prime Minister Rama, and Lulzim Basha all condemned the assault on Berisha. Berisha himself forgave the perpetrator.

On 11 June 2024, the Court of Appeal gave a final verdict recognizing Berisha as the official Chairman of the Democratic Party.

==Personal life==

Berisha is married to Liri Berisha (née Ramaj), a pediatrician. Liri Berisha is the president of Albanian Children Foundation. Her foundation focuses on children with autism and Down syndrome. The couple have two children, a daughter, Argita Malltezi (née Berisha) who is a professor of law at the University of Tirana, and a son, Shkëlzen Berisha.

On October 21, 2023, Berisha&#x27;s son in law, Jamarbër Malltezi, was arrested by Albanian police on accusations of corruption and money laundering allegedly committed during Berisha&#x27;s tenure as Prime Minister of Albania. Berisha himself was accused of aiding and abetting the alleged crime, and had his passport confiscated by the prosecutors, until the trial&#x27;s end. Berisha has strongly denied the allegations, and has publicly accused the prosecutors of a political attack, claiming that they were acting on the orders of Prime Minister Edi Rama.

Elmar Brok, former Member of the European Parliament and Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the European Parliament, visited Berisha while under house arrest by labelling him as the last political prisoner in Europe considering that &quot;a man should not be prohibited to go to Parliament until a court has taken a decision that he is guilty&quot;.

== Sanctions ==
On 19 May 2021, Berisha, his wife, son and daughter were sanctioned by the US Department of State and barred from entry into the United States after being accused of &quot;involvement in significant corruption&quot;. On the press conference Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken stated: 

Berisha has disputed the allegations, commenting that 

On July 21, the British embassy in Tirana announced it had taken action against several Albanian individuals but did not disclose their names. The prime minister&#x27;s special envoy to the Western Balkans Stuart Peach said in a statement: The next day, Berisha revealed that he was subject to this action.

==Controversies==

=== Human rights abuses ===
In 1996, Human Rights Watch published a report regarding human rights abuses perpetrated under Berisha&#x27;s administration. It claims that:
=== Haklaj family ===
In December 2022, Zylfie and Muharrem Haklaj filed a lawsuit against Berisha and 15 other people in the Special Prosecution Against Corruption and Organized Crime (Struktura e Posaçme Anti-Korrupsion, SPAK) for allegedly ordering and directing the murder of their four brothers Shkëlqim, Halil, Fatmir and Ylli Haklaj in Tropojë in the late 1990s and early 2000s and the attacks with shells and TNT against their tower in the village of Kërrnajë.

=== Corruption charges ===
In October 2023, Berisha was placed under investigation on suspicion of abusing his position as prime minister to help his son-in-law, Jamarber Malltezi, privatize public land in order to build 17 apartment buildings in Tirana. In December 2023, Berisha was stripped of his parliamentary immunity and placed under house arrest. He was formally charged with corruption on 11 September 2024.

<text>A breed is a specific group of breedable domestic animals having homogeneous appearance (phenotype), homogeneous behavior, and/or other characteristics that distinguish it from other organisms of the same species. In literature, there exist several slightly deviating definitions. Breeds are formed through genetic isolation and either natural adaptation to the environment or selective breeding, or a combination of the two. Despite the centrality of the idea of &quot;breeds&quot; to animal husbandry and agriculture, no single, scientifically accepted definition of the term exists. A breed is therefore not an objective or biologically verifiable classification but is instead a term of art amongst groups of breeders who share a consensus around what qualities make some members of a given species members of a nameable subset.

Another point of view is that a breed is consistent enough in type to be logically grouped together and when mated within the group produce the same type. When bred together, individuals of the same breed pass on these predictable traits to their offspring, and this abilityknown as &quot;breeding true&quot;is a requirement for a breed. Plant breeds are more commonly known as cultivars. The offspring produced as a result of breeding animals of one breed with other animals of another breed are known as crossbreeds or mixed breeds. Crosses between animal or plant variants above the level of breed/cultivar (i.e. between species, subspecies, botanical &quot;variety&quot;, even different genera) are referred to as &quot;hybrids&quot;.

==Breeding: selection by breeders==
The breeder (or group of breeders) who initially establishes a breed does so by selecting individual animals from within a gene pool that they see as having the necessary qualities needed to enhance the breed model they are aiming for. These animals are referred to as foundation stock. Furthermore, the breeder mates the most desirable representatives of the breed from his or her point of view, aiming to pass such characteristics to their progeny. This process is known as selective breeding. A written description of desirable and undesirable breed representatives is referred to as a breed standard.

==Breed characteristics==
Breed specific characteristics, also known as breed traits, are inherited, and purebred animals pass such traits from generation to generation. Thus, all specimens of the same breed carry several genetic characteristics of the original foundation animal(s). In order to maintain the breed, a breeder would select those animals with the most desirable traits to achieve further maintenance and developing of such traits. At the same time, the breed would avoid animals carrying characteristics undesirable or not typical for the breed, including faults or genetic defects. The population within the same breed should consist of a sufficient number of animals to maintain the breed within the specified parameters without the necessity of forced inbreeding.

Domestic animal breeds commonly differ from country to country, and from nation to nation. Breeds originating in a certain country are known as &quot;native breeds&quot; of that country.

<text>Kai Tak Airport was an international airport of Hong Kong from 1925 until 1998. Officially known as Hong Kong International Airport from 1954 to 6 July 1998, it is often referred to as Hong Kong International Airport, Kai Tak, or simply Kai Tak and Kai Tak International Airport, to distinguish it from its successor, Chek Lap Kok International Airport, built on reclaimed and levelled land around the islands of Chek Lap Kok and Lam Chau, to the west.

Because of the geography of the area, with water on three sides of the runway, Kowloon City&#x27;s residential apartment complexes to the north-west and mountains more than high to the north-east of the airport, aircraft could not fly over the mountains and quickly drop in for a final approach. Instead, aircraft had to fly above Victoria Harbour and Kowloon City, passing north of Mong Kok&#x27;s Bishop Hill. After passing Bishop Hill, pilots would see Checkerboard Hill with a large orange-and-white checkerboard pattern. Once the pattern was sighted and identified, the aircraft made a low-altitude (sub-600 ft; ) 47-degree right-hand turn, ending with a short final approach and touchdown. For pilots, this airport was technically demanding, as the approach could not be flown by aircraft instruments, but had to be flown visually because of the right-hand turn required.

The airport was home to Hong Kong&#x27;s international carrier Cathay Pacific, as well as regional carrier Dragonair (since 2016 known as Cathay Dragon), freight airline Air Hong Kong and Hong Kong Airways. The airport was also home to the former RAF Kai Tak and the Hong Kong Aviation Club.

==Geographic environment==
Kai Tak was located on the eastern side of Kowloon Bay in Kowloon, Hong Kong. The area is surrounded by rugged mountains. Less than to the north and northeast of the former runway 13 threshold is a range of hills reaching an elevation of . To the east of the former 31 threshold, the hills are less than away. Immediately to the south of the airport is Victoria Harbour, and farther south is Hong Kong Island with hills up to .

When Kai Tak closed, there was only one runway in use, numbered 13/31 and oriented southeast-northwest (134/314 degrees true, 136/316 degrees magnetic). The runway was made by reclaiming land from the harbour and was extended several times after its initial construction. The runway was when it was opened in 1958 and long when the airport closed in 1998. During the period between 1945 and 1955 the airport used a different 13/31 alongside a crossing 07/25. These two runways were and .

At the northern end of the runway at closure, buildings rose to six stories just across a major multi-lane arterial road. The other three sides of the runway were surrounded by Victoria Harbour. The low-altitude turning manoeuvre before the shortened final approach was so close to these buildings that passengers could spot television sets in the apartments: &quot;...as the plane banked sharply to the right for landing ... the people watching television in the nearby apartments seemed an unsettling arm&#x27;s length away.&quot;

==History==
===1925 to 1930s===
The story of Kai Tak started in 1912 when two businessmen, Ho Kai and Au Tak, formed the Kai Tak Investment Company to reclaim land in Kowloon for development. The land was acquired by the government for use as an airfield after the business plan failed.

In 1924, Harry Abbott opened the Abbott School of Aviation on that piece of land. Soon, it became a small grass strip runway airport used by the RAF, and by several flying clubs which, over time grew to include the Hong Kong Flying Club, the Far East Flying Training School, and the Aero Club of Hong Kong; these exist today as an amalgamation known as the Hong Kong Aviation Club. In 1928, a concrete slipway was built for seaplanes that used the adjoining Kowloon Bay. The first control tower and hangar at Kai Tak were built in 1935. In 1936, the first domestic airline in Hong Kong was established.

===World War II===

Hong Kong fell into the hands of the Japanese on 12 December 1941, during World War II. In 1942, the Japanese army expanded Kai Tak, using many Allied prisoner-of-war (POW) labourers, building two concrete runways, 13/31 and 07/25. Numerous POW diary entries exist recalling the gruelling work and long hours working on building Kai Tak. During the process, the historic wall of the Kowloon Walled City and the tall Sung Wong Toi, a memorial for the last Song dynasty emperor, were destroyed for materials. A 2001 Environmental Study recommended that a new memorial be erected for the Sung Wong Toi rock and other remnants of the Kowloon area before Kai Tak.

===1945 to 1970s===

It was also the location of , a Royal Navy Mobile Operational Naval Air Base, (MONAB) VIII, which was situated here between 1945 and 1947. At the start of April 1947, it was decommissioned, and concurrently re-commissioned as HMS &quot;Flycatcher&quot;. At the end of December, HMS &quot;Flycatcher&quot; was officially decommissioned at Kai Tak, although the Royal Navy retained lodger rights until 1978.

A plan to turn Kai Tak into a modern airport was released in 1954. By 1957 runway 13/31 had been extended to , while runway 7/25 remained long; night operations were not allowed. Bristol Britannia 102s took over BOAC&#x27;s London-Tokyo flights in the summer of 1957 and were the largest airliners scheduled to the old airport (Boeing Stratocruisers never flew there). In 1958 the new NW/SE runway extending into Kowloon Bay was completed by land reclamation. The two old runways were removed with footprints used by the apron and terminal building. The passenger terminal was completed in 1962. The runway was extended in the mid-1970s to , the final length. This extension was completed in June 1974, but the full length of the runway was not in use until 31 December 1975, as construction of the new Airport Tunnel had kept the northwestern end of the runway closed.

In 1955 Kai Tak Airport was featured in the film &quot;The Night My Number Came Up&quot;.

An Instrument Guidance System (IGS) was installed in 1974 to aid landing on runway 13. Use of the airport under adverse conditions was greatly increased.

In the 1970s, the airport&#x27;s increasing traffic and growth of high-density developments around it raised concerns about the potential loss of life should a crash occur, though no serious accidents happened throughout its history of operations.

===Overcrowding in the 1980s and 1990s===
The growth of Hong Kong also put a strain on the airport&#x27;s capacity. Its usage was close to, and for some time exceeded, the designed capacity. The airport was designed to handle 24 million passengers per year, but in 1996, Kai Tak handled 29.5 million passengers, plus 1.56 million tonnes of freight, making it the third busiest airport in the world in terms of international passenger traffic, and busiest in terms of international cargo throughput. Moreover, clearance requirements for aircraft takeoffs and landings made it necessary to limit the height of buildings that could be built in Kowloon. While Kai Tak was initially located far away from residential areas, the expansion of both residential areas and the airport resulted in Kai Tak being close to residential areas. This caused serious noise and engine pollution for nearby residents and put height restrictions, which were removed after Kai Tak closed. A night curfew from 11:30 pm to 6:30 am in the early morning also hindered operations.
As a result, in the late 1980s, the Hong Kong Government began searching for alternative locations for a new airport in Hong Kong to replace the aging airport. After deliberating on several locations, including the south side of Hong Kong Island, the government decided to build the airport on the island of Chek Lap Kok off Lantau Island. The new airport is located far away from Hong Kong&#x27;s main residential areas, conducive to minimising the dangers of a major crash and also reducing the nuisance of noise pollution. A huge number of resources were mobilised to build this new airport, part of the ten programmes in Hong Kong&#x27;s Airport Core Programme.

The Regal Meridien Hong Kong Airport Hotel (now the Regal Oriental Hotel), linked to the passenger terminal by a footbridge spanning Prince Edward Road, opened on 19 July 1982. This was Hong Kong&#x27;s first airport hotel and comprised 380 rooms including 47 suites. The hotel still exists, but the footbridge (which was connected to the passenger terminal) has been demolished. It is one of the few remaining buildings related to Kai Tak Airport.

===Closure and legacy of Kai Tak Airport===
The new airport in Chek Lap Kok officially opened on 6 July 1998 to replace the functions of Kai Tak Airport. All of the essential airport supplies and vehicles that were left in the old airport for operation (some of the non-essential ones had already been transported to the new airport) were transported to Chek Lap Kok in one early morning with a single massive move, with a police escort.

On 6 July 1998 at 3:30 AM local, after the final aircraft departed for Chek Lap Kok, Kai Tak was finally retired as an airport, with its ICAO and IATA airport codes were reassigned to the new airport at Chek Lap Kok. Below were the final flights of Kai Tak:

* The last arrival: Dragonair KA841 from Chongqing (Airbus A320-200) landed Runway 13 at 23:38 (11:38 p.m.)
* The last scheduled commercial flight: Cathay Pacific CX251 to London–Heathrow (Boeing 747-400) took off from Runway 13 at 00:02 (12:02 a.m.)
* The last departure: Cathay Pacific CX3340 ferry flight to the new airport at Chek Lap Kok (Airbus A340-300) took off from Runway 13 at 01:05 (1:05 a.m.)

With the ferry flight&#x27;s takeoff to Chek Lap Kok, a ceremony celebrating the end of the airport was held inside the control tower, with then-director of civil aviation Richard Siegel, giving a brief speech; he ended with the words &quot;Goodbye Kai Tak, and thank you&quot;, before dimming the lights briefly and then turning them off.

Chek Lap Kok opened at 06:00 (6:00 a.m.) on 6 July 1998 with the arrival of Cathay Pacific Flight 889 (nicknamed Polar 1) from New York–JFK. The first week of operations was disrupted by a sequence of IT failures based around software bugs in the Flight Information Display System. This in turn disrupted baggage handling and airbridge allocation. But by the end of the first week these challenges, and other teething problems, were largely resolved, and the new airport was exceeding Kai Tak performance measures. The exception was the new airport&#x27;s main air cargo terminal built and operated by HACTL as a franchisee. The terminal faced major difficulties in coming into operation on 6 July, such that it closed again on 7 July to enable the franchisee to implement a major recovery programme. The disruption this caused to air cargo operations at the new airport led the government to temporarily reactivate Kai Tak&#x27;s cargo terminal for a month. During this period, the airport was given temporary ICAO code VHHX.

The Kai Tak passenger terminal later housed government offices, automobile dealerships and showrooms, gaming arcades, a mall, shopping centers, a go-kart racecourse, a bowling alley, a snooker hall, a mini-golf range and other recreational facilities. In the mid-2000s, the passenger terminal and hangars were demolished. Many aviation enthusiasts were upset at the demise of Kai Tak because of the unique runway 13 approach. As private aviation was no longer allowed at Chek Lap Kok (having moved to Sek Kong Airfield), some enthusiasts had lobbied to keep about of the Kai Tak runway for general aviation, but the suggestion was rejected as the Government had planned to build a new cruise terminal at Kai Tak.

The Hong Kong stop of Celine Dion&#x27;s Let&#x27;s Talk About Love World Tour was held on the airport&#x27;s apron on 25 January 1999.

Until its retirement in 2018, the name Kai Tak was one of the names used in the lists of tropical cyclone names in the northwest Pacific Ocean. Submitted by Hong Kong, it was used four times.

BMW used to test its hydrogen cars on the former Kai Tak apron area, while a golf course was set up at the end of Runway 31.

==Operations==

===Terminals and facilities===
The Kai Tak airport consisted of a linear passenger terminal building with a car park attached at the rear. There were eight boarding gates attached to the terminal building.

A freight terminal was located on the south side of the east apron and diagonally from the passenger terminal building. Due to the limited space, the fuel tank farm was located between the passenger terminal and HAECO maintenance hangar.

===Companies with operations at Kai Tak===

* Cathay Pacific, which operated a mixed Airbus, Boeing and some Lockheed all-wide-body fleet of one hundred aircraft, providing scheduled services to the rest of Asia, Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, Europe, South Africa and North America.
* Dragonair
* Air Hong Kong Limited
* Hong Kong Airways (until late 1950s when bought by Cathay Pacific)
* British Asia Airways (due to relations between PRC and ROC)

Other tenants included:

* Hong Kong Aviation Club
* Government Flying Service
* DFS Kai Tak Market
* Häagen-Dazs
* Tin Tin Restaurant

===Runway 13 arrival===


The landing approach for planes using runway 13 at Kai Tak was considered spectacular and was infamous, not just amongst aviation enthusiasts but amongst the general public as well. Flight simulator charts, which are based on the real charts used at the airport, give an outline of the procedures used on approach to Kai Tak Airport.

====Checkerboard approach====
The Checkerboard approach (also spelled as Chequerboard approach) initially begins to the south-west of the airport, with aircraft flying westbound at a minimum altitude of 6000 feet. At this beginning stage of the approach, the aircraft should be passing above Cheung Chau – a small island just off Lantau Island. After that, the aircraft was required to proceed up to &quot;Point Golf&quot;, which was on the south side of Lantau Island and directly south of the current Chek Lap Kok Airport. Approaching aircraft then had to make a right-hand U-turn to intercept the localiser for the Runway 13 IGS, which generally happened above the current Chek Lap Kok Airport site. The IGS (abbreviation of Instrument Guidance System) was effectively a localizer type directional aid, which was offset from the runway heading by 47°, which aided aircraft by guiding them via radio signals, much like an instrument landing system. At roughly 2500 feet, the autopilot was disconnected, and the rest of the approach was flown manually. The aircraft then descended below 1000 feet and shortly afterwards reached Kowloon Tsai Park and its small hill (Checkerboard Hill). Upon reaching the small hill above Kowloon Tsai Park, which was painted with a large &quot;aviation orange&quot; and white checkerboard (), used as a visual reference point on the final approach (in addition to the middle marker on the Instrument Guidance System), the pilot needed to make a 47° visual right turn to line up with the runway and complete the final leg. The aircraft would be just from touchdown, at a height of less than when the turn was made. Typically the plane would enter the final right turn at a height of about and exit it at a height of to line up with the runway. That demanding manoeuvre became known in the aviation community as the &quot;Hong Kong Turn&quot; or the &quot;Checkerboard Turn&quot;. For many airline passengers on planes approaching and landing on Runway 13 at Kai Tak Airport, it became referred to as the &quot;Kai Tak Heart Attack&quot;, because they were often frightened to be turning at such a proximity to the ground, which, at less than 150 ft, or 45 metres, was generally less than even the Boeing 767&#x27;s wingspan, which is considered a medium-size airliner. The turn was so low that passengers could see television sets running in people&#x27;s residences near the airport.

Handling the runway 13 approach was difficult enough with normal crosswinds because, even if the wind direction was constant, it was changing relative to the aircraft as the plane made the 47° visual right turn, meaning that what would be a headwind heading directly east on the IGS would become a crosswind and begin to push the aircraft over and off the runway alignment without correction. The landing would become even more challenging when crosswinds from the northeast were strong and gusty during typhoons. The mountain range northeast of the airport also made the wind vary greatly in both speed and direction. Watching large aircraft banking at low altitudes and taking big crab angles during their final approaches was popular with plane spotters. Despite the difficulty, the Runway 13 approach was used most of the time due to the prevailing wind direction in Hong Kong.

Because of the turn required during the final approach, ILS was not available for runway 13 and landings had to follow a visual approach. This made the approach unusable in low visibility conditions.

====Stonecutters&#x27; Approach====
Alongside the Chequerboard approach, there was a lesser-known approach into Kai Tak that led aircraft over the Stonecutters&#x27; NDB at a heading of 040 and led into a ~90° turn to line up on Runway 13. This approach was used extremely infrequently, since the Chequerboard approach had a localiser and glide slope to work with, and NDBs are very rarely used in commercial aviation today. It generally can be assumed this approach was used when the localiser and glide slope were offline for maintenance.

===Runway 13 departure===
Runway 13 was the preferred departure runway for heavy aircraft due to the clear departure path, opposite that of the Runway 31 departure. Heavy aircraft on departure using runway 13 would often need nearly the entire length of the runway, particularly during summer days due to the air temperature.

===Runway 31 arrival===
Runway 31 approaches and landings were similar to other airports in which ILS was available. Runway 31 is the reciprocal of 13, ie. it occupied the same physical space but denoted a runway facing the inverse direction, a northwesterly heading of about 310°, as opposed to about 130° for runway 13. The approach path towards the runway from the southeast passed within of Heng Fa Chuen on Hong Kong Island.

Runway 31 was also used for landing early in the morning for noise abatement.

===Runway 31 departure===
When lined up for takeoff on runway 31, a range of hills including Beacon Hill were directly in front of the aircraft. The pilots had to make a sharp 65-degree left turn soon after takeoff to avoid the hills (i.e. the reverse of a Runway 13 landing). If a runway change occurred due to a wind change from runway 13 departures to runway 31 departures, planes that were loaded to the maximum payload for runway 13 departures had to return to the terminal to offload some goods to provide enough climbing clearance over buildings during a runway 31 departure.

===Private aviation===

The Hong Kong Aviation Club formerly held most of its activities at Kai Tak, where it had hangars and other facilities.

The club moved most of its aircraft to Shek Kong Airfield in 1994 after the hours for general aviation at Kai Tak were sharply reduced, to two hours per morning, as of 1 July that year. Kai Tak closed to fixed-wing traffic in 1998. The club ended its helicopter activities at Kai Tak on 9 July 2017. The Kai Tak location, which it was able to use all days of the week, meant that helicopter training took less time compared to fixed-wing training, as usage at Shek Kong is restricted to weekends.

==Incidents and accidents==
Many planes crashed at Kai Tak due to poor weather and hard approaches killing 131 people from 1947 to 1994:

* On 25 January 1947, a Philippine Air Lines DC-3 aircraft crashed into Mount Parker, killing four crew members.
* On 21 December 1948, a China National Aviation Corporation Douglas DC-4 struck Basalt Island after a descent through clouds. 35 were killed.
* On 24 February 1949, a Cathay Pacific Douglas DC-3 crashed into a hillside near Braemar Reservoir after aborting an approach in poor visibility and attempting to go around. All 23 on board were killed.
* On 11 March 1951, a Pacific Overseas Airlines Douglas DC-4 crashed after takeoff into the hills between Mount Butler and Mount Parker on Hong Kong Island. The captain of the aircraft allegedly failed to execute the turn left operation after departure. 24 were killed.
* On 9 April 1951, a Siamese Airways Douglas DC-3 lost control of its turn while attempting a night-time visual approach. The captain allegedly allowed the aircraft to lose speed while attempting to turn quickly. 16 were killed.
* On 19 April 1961, a U.S. military Douglas DC-3 (C-47 Skytrain) bound for Formosa crashed into Mount Parker after takeoff. Of the 16 on board, 15 were killed.
* On 24 August 1965, a United States Marine Corps C-130 Hercules crashed shortly after takeoff from runway 13, killing 59 of the 71 people on board. This was the deadliest crash at Kai Tak.
* On 30 June 1967, a Thai Airways International Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle III crashed into Victoria Harbour while trying to land during a torrential rainstorm. A typhoon was some NW of Hong Kong, but the colony was not closed down in preparation for the typhoon. The co-pilot, who was flying the aircraft and unable to see the runway due to the heavy rain, allegedly made an abrupt heading change, causing the aircraft to enter a high rate of descent and crash into the harbour to the right of the runway. The starboard wing snapped off on impact, and the aircraft rolled onto its starboard side, halving the number of escape routes. 24 were killed, but only 23 bodies were recovered at the scene. The final body was recovered after it was seen floating in the harbour six weeks later.
* On 2 September 1977, a Transmeridian Air Cargo Canadair CL-44 lost control and crashed into the Tathong Channel following a fire shortly after takeoff. The no. 4 engine was said to have failed, causing an internal fire in the engine and the aircraft fuel system that eventually resulted in a massive external fire. Four were killed.
* On 9 March 1978, China Airlines Flight 831 was hijacked. The hijacker (the flight engineer of the flight) demanded to be taken to Mainland China (the airline was of the Republic of China in Taiwan, not the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which controlled the mainland). The hijack lasted less than a day, and the hijacker was killed.
*On 7 February 1980, a China Airlines Boeing 747-200 B-1866 (later B-18255) had a tail-strike incident while landing at Kai Tak International Airport en route to Taipei from Stockholm Arlanda Airport via King Abdulaziz International Airport and Kai Tak. The aircraft was improperly repaired which caused it to break up in flight on 25 May 2002 while flying to Kai Tak&#x27;s successor, Chek Lap Kok Airport.
* On 18 October 1983, a Lufthansa Boeing 747 freighter abandoned takeoff after engine no. 2 malfunctioned, probably at speed exceeding V1 (the takeoff/abort decision point). The aircraft overran the runway onto soft ground and sustained severe damage. The three crew on board suffered minor injuries.
* On 31 August 1988, the right outboard flap of a CAAC Airlines Hawker Siddeley Trident operating Flight 301 hit approach lights of runway 31 while landing under rain and fog. The right main landing gear then struck a lip and collapsed, causing the aircraft to run off the runway and slip into the harbour. 7 were killed.
* On 4 November 1993, a China Airlines Boeing 747-400, operating Flight 605, overran the runway while landing amid gale-force winds during a typhoon. Despite the plane&#x27;s unstable approach, the captain did not go around. The aircraft touched down more than 2/3 down the runway and was unable to stop before the runway ended. Although the aircraft ended up submerged beyond the end of the runway, there were only 23 minor injuries amongst the 396 passengers and crew. 
* On 23 September 1994, a Lockheed L-100-30 Hercules lost control shortly after takeoff from runway 13. The pitch control system of one of its propellers was said to have failed. Six were killed.

==Redevelopment==

===2002 blueprint===
In October 1998, the Government drafted a plan for the Kai Tak Airport site, involving the reclamation of of land. After receiving many objections, the Government scaled down the reclamation to in June 1999. The Territorial Development Department commenced a new study on the development of the area in November 1999, entitled &quot;Feasibility Studies on the Revised Southeast Kowloon Development Plan&quot;, and a new public consultation exercise was conducted in May 2000, resulting in the land reclamation being further scaled down to . The new plans based on the feasibility studies were passed by the chief executive in July 2002.
There were plans for the site of Kai Tak to be used for housing development, which was once projected to house around 240,000–340,000 residents. Due to calls from the public to protect the harbour and participate more deeply in future town planning, the scale and plan of the project were yet to be decided. There were also plans for a railway station and a maintenance centre in the proposed plan for the Sha Tin to Central Link.

There were also proposals to dredge the runway to form several islands for housing, to build a terminal capable of accommodating cruise ships the size of Queen Mary 2, and more recently, to house the Hong Kong Sports Institute, as well as several stadiums, in the case that the institute was forced to move so that the equestrian events of the 2008 Summer Olympics could be held at its present site in Sha Tin.

On 9 January 2004, the Court of Final Appeal ruled that no reclamation plan for Victoria Harbour could be introduced unless it passed an &quot;overriding public interest&quot; test. Subsequently, the Government abandoned these plans.

===Kai Tak Planning Review===
The Government set up a &quot;Kai Tak Planning Review&quot; in July 2004 for further public consultation. Several plans were presented.

====June 2006 blueprint====
A new plan for the redevelopment of Kai Tak was issued by the government in June 2006. Under these proposals, hotels would be scattered throughout the site, and flats aimed at housing 86,000 new residents were proposed.

Other features of the plan included two cruise terminals and a large stadium.

====October 2006 blueprint====
The Planning Department unveiled a major reworking of its plans for the old Kai Tak airport site on 17 October 2006, containing &quot;a basket of small measures designed to answer a bevvy of concerns raised by the public&quot;. The revised blueprint will also extend several &quot;green corridors&quot; from the main central park into the surrounding neighbourhoods of Kowloon City, Kowloon Bay and Ma Tau Kok.

The following features are proposed in the revised plan:

* two cruise terminals, with a third terminal to be added if the need arises
* a luxury hotel complex near the cruise terminals—the complex would sit about seven stories high, with hotel rooms atop commercial or tourist-related spaces
* an eight-station monorail linking the tourist hub with Kwun Tong
* a large stadium
* a central park to provide green space
* a high public viewing tower near the tip of the runway
* a new bridge, likely to involve further reclamation of Victoria Harbour

The following are major changes:

* hotel spaces are to be centralised near the end of the runway, and will face into the harbour towards Central
* a third cruise terminal could be added at the foot of the hotel cluster if the need arises
* a second row of luxury residential spaces is to be added facing Kwun Tong, built on an elevated terrace or platform to preserve a view of the harbour

The government has promised that:

* the total amount of housing and hotel space will remain the same as proposed in June 2006
* plot ratios will be the same as before
* The total commercial space on the site will also remain about the same

The new bridge proposed by the government, joining the planned hotel district at the end of the runway with Kwun Tong, could be a potential source of controversy. Under the Protection of the Harbour Ordinance, no harbour reclamation can take place unless the Government can demonstrate to the courts an &quot;overriding public need&quot;.

The new Kai Tak blueprint was presented to the Legislative Council on 24 October 2006 after review by the Town Planning Board.

===2011 onwards===
In 2011, with most of the former Kai Tak area still abandoned, ideas were floated to develop the area for commercial property, citing shortages of office space and rising property costs. In June 2013, the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal was opened on the tip of the former runway. Two public housing estates opened on the northeast area of the site in 2013, providing over 13,000 new rental flats. As of 2018, the public estates have been joined by some private residential developments, now nearing completion.

A small park and a new hospital (Hong Kong Children&#x27;s Hospital) which began August 2013, have 2,400 rooms, 37 operating theatres, a neuroscience centre, an oncology centre specialist, outpatient clinics with a capacity of over 1.4 million annual attendances and a community health centre.

A new Mass Transit Railway (MTR) station, Kai Tak, opened on the former airport land on 14 February 2020 for phase one of the Tuen Ma line.

Construction of the Kai Tak Sports Park on the former airport land commenced in April 2019. Once completed, Kai Tak Sports Park will be the largest sports venue in Hong Kong and will include a 50,000 seat Main Stadium, an Indoor Sports Center, a Public Sports Ground and multiple open spaces.

Kai Tak Sky Garden, a massive elevated garden, opened in May 2021. It occupies part of the former runway and apron.

<text>The woodcreepers (Dendrocolaptinae) comprise a subfamily of suboscine passerine birds endemic to the Neotropics. They have traditionally been considered a distinct family Dendrocolaptidae, but most authorities now place them as a subfamily of the ovenbirds (Furnariidae). They superficially resemble the Old World treecreepers, but they are unrelated and the similarities are due to convergent evolution. The subfamily contains 60 species in 16 genera.

Woodcreepers range from 14 to 35 cm in length. Generally brownish birds, the true woodcreepers maintain an upright vertical posture, supported by their specialized stiff tails.

They feed mainly on insects taken from tree trunks. Some woodcreepers often form part of the core group at the centre of flocks attending army ant swarms. Woodcreepers are arboreal cavity-nesting birds; two or three white eggs are laid and incubated for about 15 to 21 days.

These birds can be difficult to identify in that they tend to have similar brown upperparts, and the more distinctive underparts are hard to see on a bird pressed against a trunk in deep forest shade. The bill shape, extend/shape of spots/streaks, and call are useful aids to determining species.

==Description==

The woodcreepers are generally fairly uniform in appearance. They range in size from the wedge-billed woodcreeper () to the strong-billed woodcreeper (). Males tend to be slightly larger than females on average, but considerable overlap in size occurs in most species. Pronounced sexual dimorphism in size and plumage is rare. Bill size and shape accounts for much of the variation between the species. Bills can be straight or highly decurved, and can account for as much as a quarter of the length of the bird (as happens in the long-billed woodcreeper). The plumage is usually subdued and often brown, or sometimes rufous or other dark colours. Many species have patterns such as checking, spotting, or barring on their plumage. The feathers of the tail are rigid and are used for supporting the body when climbing tree trunks; the tail can support most of the body weight and birds that lose their tail find climbing difficult. Woodcreepers climb by flexing their legs and hopping up the trunk. The feet of the woodcreepers are also modified for climbing. The front toes are strongly clawed and toe IV is as long as toe III to increase the ability of the bird to grasp around branches. The legs are short but strong. Woodcreepers are also characterized by a belly feather growth pattern not found in any other birds.

==Habitat and distribution==

The woodcreepers are generally forest birds of Central and South America. Most species occur in rainforests, with the centre of diversity of the subfamily being the Amazon Basin. As many as 19 species of woodcreeper may co-occur in some areas of the Amazon, although in other rainforests, such as those in Costa Rica, the numbers are much lower. Other habitats used by the woodcreepers include pine-oak woodland, montane cloud forest, and pine forests. A few species, like the scimitar-billed woodcreeper, inhabit savannah or other partly open environments. Woodcreepers are absent from the temperate forests of southern South America.

==Behaviour==

===Diet and feeding===
The woodcreepers are insectivores that are mostly arboreal in nature. Insects form the majority of the diet, with some spiders, centipedes, millipedes and even lizards being taken as well. A few specimens collected by scientists had fruit or seeds in their stomachs, but plant material is not thought to be regularly taken by any species. A few species forage on the ground, but most forage on the trunks of trees, on and on the underside of branches. They are generally solitary or occur in pairs, but frequently join mixed-species feeding flocks. The flocks they join are usually the lower level ones rather than canopy flocks, and are usually those insectivorous ones rather than frugivorous ones. Prey is almost always obtained by moving up the trunk or branch, and there are two main foraging techniques, probing and sallying. Probers investigate rough bark, mosses, masses of trapped dead leaves, bromeliads, and other areas where prey may be hiding, whereas those that sally launch into the air briefly to snatch prey that has been flushed by their movement. Several species regularly attend swarms of army ants to catch prey flushed by the ants.

==Systematics==

The former family has been merged into the ovenbird family, Furnariidae, by most authorities because analyses of mt and nDNA sequence data showed &quot;Sclerurus&quot; leaftossers and &quot;Geositta&quot; miners to be basal to the Furnariidae &quot;and&quot; the woodcreepers. An alternative option was recommended by Moyle &quot;et al.&quot; (2009), in which the woodcreepers maintain their status as a family, while the ovenbirds (as traditionally defined) are split into two families: Scleruridae and Furnariidae.

The genus &quot;Xenops&quot;, which have usually been considered ovenbirds, represent an early divergence. Although some analyses suggested that they are more closely related to the woodcreepers than to true furnariids, other studies have not found the same results. Others suggested placing &quot;Xenops&quot; in its own family Xenopidae.

Evolutionary relationships among woodcreeper species are now fairly well known thanks to the use of DNA sequence data. Some previous results based on morphology were not supported by molecular data, mostly due to instances of convergent evolution in beak morphology. Plumage patterns, on the other hand, are more in agreement with the molecular data.

DNA studies revealed that &quot;Deconychura&quot; species belong into separate genera and that the Greater scythebill is not closely related to other scythebills in the genus &quot;Campylorhamphus&quot; but to &quot;Drymornis&quot;. Moving &quot;Lepidocolaptes fuscus&quot; to &quot;Xiphorhynchus&quot; restores monophyly of &quot;Lepidocolaptes&quot;.

Additionally, the species-level taxonomy of several groups requires further study. Examples of &quot;species&quot; where vocal and morphological variations suggests that more than one species-level taxon could be involved are the curve-billed scythebill and the white-chinned, olivaceous, strong-billed and straight-billed woodcreepers. The genus &quot;Xiphorhynchus&quot; also requires much more research in this regard. &quot;Hylexetastes&quot; may contain anything from one to four species.

A cladogram of the 16 woodcreeper genera based on the results of a 2020 molecular phylogenetic study of the suboscines by Michael Harvey and collaborators is shown below.

<text>Loviisa (; ; formerly Degerby) is a town in Finland, located on the southern coast of the country. Loviisa is situated in the eastern part of the Uusimaa region. The population of Loviisa is approximately , while the sub-region has a population of approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland.

Loviisa is located from Helsinki and from Porvoo. The municipality covers an area of of which is water. The population density is .

The neighboring municipalities of Liljendal, Pernå and Ruotsinpyhtää were consolidated with Loviisa on 1 January 2010.

Loviisa is a bilingual municipality with Finnish and Swedish as its official languages. The population consists of Finnish speakers, Swedish speakers, and speakers of other languages.

Loviisa was founded in 1745, as a border fortress against Russia. Most of the fortifications have been preserved. Loviisa was originally called &quot;Degerby&quot;, but king Adolf Frederick of Sweden renamed the city after his spouse Lovisa Ulrika after visiting the town in 1752.

Loviisa is the site of two of Finland&#x27;s nuclear reactors, two VVER units each of 488 MWe, at the Loviisa Nuclear Power Plant. The other operating reactors are at the Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant.

== History ==
=== 18th century ===
The town of Degerby was founded on the grounds of the Degerby horse stable in Pernå in 1745 as a frontier and fortress town. Eastern Finland needed a new staple town because the eastern border had shifted in the 1743 Treaty of Åbo. The only staple town in eastern Finland, Hamina, was left beyond the border. King Adolf Frederick of Sweden visited Degerby in 1752 and renamed the town as &quot;Loviisa&quot; after his wife, Queen Louisa Ulrika of Prussia. The first mayor of Loviisa from 1747 to 1765 was Jacob af Forselles, who had fled from Hamina and bought the Petjärvi (Strömfors) ironworks together with Anders Nohrström.

In 1748 construction of the Loviisa fortress started, but it soon ground to a halt because of financial difficulties in the kingdom of Sweden. Only part of the outer battlements were constructed. The bastions Rosen and Ungern to the east of the current city centre serve as reminders of the history of the fortress town. The Svartholm fortress to the south of the town was built at the same time as the Loviisa fortress. This marine fortress was meant to protect the town from the seaside and provide a safe harbour for the coastal fleet of Sweden. The Swedish era in Svartholm ended in 1808 when the fortress surrendered to the Russians almost without resistance.

=== 19th century ===
The year 1855 during the Crimean War was a dramatic time in Loviisa. Late in the evening on 5 July a fire broke out in the town, which destroyed a large part of the old town blocks in the centre. As well as about 70 residential buildings, the wooden church of Loviisa was also destroyed in the fire. During the previous day, the English fleet had started firing at Svartholm, and on the day of the fire the fortress had exploded into ruins. The gunfire from the English warship was not actually connected to the fire in the town, and the actual cause of the fire remains a mystery. The events of summer 1855 are depicted in Runar Schildt&#x27;s 1916 novel &quot;Sateenkaari&quot; (&quot;Regnbågen&quot;), with certain artistic liberties.

After the fire there was a proposal to move the town to the south, but the Imperial Senate decided in April 1856 to rebuild Loviisa at its original site. The reconstruction was done according to Ernst Lohrmann&#x27;s zoning plan, which was largely based on Georg Theodor Chiewitz&#x27;s proposal made before the fire. At the same time, in the early 1860s, Loviisa started to consciously develop into a spa town. The main building of the waterworks was built in 1865 at the site of the current Kappelinpuisto park. A restaurant was founded in the same greenspace, and the local &quot;health springs&quot; were put back into use.

In the 1880s Georg Öhman, the senior doctor at the spa, recommended Myllyharju as a suitable walking site for spa guests. A viewing pavilion was built in the early 1890s at the hill (at the site where the last windmill was transferred to in the 1920s). At the end of the decade the Mossebacken pension and the summer restaurant Casino, both designed by Lars Sonck, were built near Kukkukivi. The wooden pavilion at Kukkukivi was replaced with the current cast iron tower in 1906. Loviisa remained a popular spa town up to World War I. The spa activity had a significant effect on the economy of the town, and the town also developed a rich cultural life particularly in terms of music.

Up to the 1880s the most important sources of income in Loviisa were trade and handicraft. What little there was of industry was concentrated on seafaring (boat crafting) and stimulants. Loviisa had had a tobacco factory already since the 1750s, and in the late 1770s a state alcohol distillery was started in Loviisa (king Gustav III had forbidden home distillation). In 1858 count Carl Magnus Creutz formed a beer brewery in Loviisa. According to historian Olle Sirén, Creutz&#x27;s entry into the business was based on his need to secure the sales of barley at the Malmgård manor. In 1874 the brewery was transferred to the Bavarian Heinrich Lehmann, and his family continued to brew beer for almost a century.

Industrialisation began in earnest in 1882 when the merchant Arseni Terichoff built a steam-operated sawmill at the current site of Sahaniemi. In the 1890s the sawmill had about fifty employees, and over a hundred in the early 1900s. A cardboard factory started in 1912 and soon became the second largest employer in the city. At the turn of the century a railway connection from Loviisa to Vesijärvi in Lahti was completed, and the cardboard factory was the first significant industrial company founded in Loviisa to make use of the railroad. The sea lane underneath the bridge was not deep enough for steamships, so harbour activity was moved first to Tullisilta and then to Valko upon the completion of the railroad.

=== 1900 to 1950 ===

World War I affected Loviisa as unemployment and rising food prices. The activity of the sawmill ended in 1914, and the activity at the harbours decreased. In 1917 the Loviisa workers&#x27; association made demands about the seating of the important food committee. Despite amends made by the city council a political strike started in August. Socialist workers demanded properly paid jobs for all citizens of Loviisa as well as at least half of the seats in the food committee. In its meeting on 18 August the city council only agreed to the first demand. On the same day the workers declared a &quot;state of full strike&quot;, cut of telecommunications and occupied the railway station. The city council held a meeting in the evening, deciding to form a guard.

On 19 August 150 citizens of Loviisa signed up for the guard, received white arm ribbons and marched onto the city square. The strikers retreated to Uusikaupunki. The socialists tried in vain to seek Russian military help from Helsinki, and during the same evening there was an attempt at the Workers&#x27; House to declare the strike as finished. But inspired by the Russian Revolution, a new strike began in Loviisa on 15 November, and only three days later the socialists called Russian soldiers for help. In addition to them, Red Guard members from Kotka arrived in Valko, and on 19 November 200 to 300 armed men marched from Valko to Loviisa. The police station, the telephone centre and the railway station were occupied. The red flag was hoisted at city hall, and 20 to 30 executive members of the city council were taken to Uusikaupunki as prisoners. A compromise about the police station was reached at the end of the year, and the situation calmed down.

Loviisa was among those places in Finland that the battles of the year 1918 affected closely. At the start the whites fought a freedom war against Russia: there were violent Russian troops in the vicinity of the city. But there was a civil war going on in Loviisa right from the start: part of the population supported a socialist revolution. Agitation played a part, but according to Sirén, in Loviisa lack of food and unemployment played the most important role. Preparation for the civil war included Jaeger training in Germany, and the first Finn to travel there was Georg Öhman, referred to as &quot;Jäger Eins&quot;, the son of a doctor in Loviisa. Other Jaegers included Ragnar Nordström, the son of a customs officer. The guards at the Loviisa region were organised at New Year and at the end of January the guards numbered almost 200 people. Their armament left much to desire.

At the start of February the Red Guard in Loviisa numbered almost a hundred men. They had received weapons from the Red Guard in Kotka and from Russian soldiers. The civil war broke out on 27 January, and a bit more than a week after that the whites controlled the eastern part of the Uusimaa region from Sipoo to Loviisa. From the whites&#x27; viewpoint it was important that the Uusimaa guards could hold their positions. They were far away from the main frontlione but could hold off against red troops. On 6 February the reds attacked Loviisa from Kotka. The attackers numbered almost 550, of which about 50 were Red Guard members from the Loviisa area. After receiving news of the advance of the reds the whites in Loviisa moved about three kilometres east from the centre. There was an armed battle, after which the whites - threatened by a blockade - retreated to the Rosen and Ungern fortresses. There was another battle in the evening, where the whites lost ten men (there are no records of the reds&#x27; losses). The whites ran nearly out of ammunition and thus they retreated to the west. The reds moved to Pyhtää. 

On the next day on 7 February the reds marched to Loviisa, hoisted a red flag at the city hall and founded their headquarters at the City Club. The reds engaged in violence resulting in more deaths of the whites than in the armed battles on 6 February. The revolutionary court of the reds issued over 70 sentences to members of the guard and to other &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot;. Many of the accused were sentenced to civil service and/or fines, so the reds would benefit financially. At the start of April, Mannerheim&#x27;s troops occupied Tampere, and the German Detachment Brandenstein numbering 3000 men landed in Valko, advancing to Uusikylä and Lahti. The detachment left Loviisa on 16 December 1918 after Germany had lost World War I.

The spa reopened in 1919. The Russians had gone way after the October Revolution in 1917, but the spa still had 250 to 400 annual visitors in the early 1920s. In 1926 a fashionable beach life became accessible by transporting large amounts of sand to the Plagen beach. However, visitor numbers decreased in the late 1920s. An announcement about discontinuing the spa was made in 1929 when the city decided to continue operations in the spa. Loviisa failed to restore its reputation at the turn of the century, the spa had become badly deteriorated and there was intense competition from Hanko. In 1931 visitor numbers dropped below a hundred, and finally the city council decided in January 1935 not to open the spa any more. The women working at the spa protested and received permission to continue work under their own responsibility. The spa season in 1935 was a huge success, but in January 1936 the main building of the spa was completely destroyed in a fire. The spa was not rebuilt.

The land fronts in the Winter War and the Continuation War were a safe distance away from Loviisa. Nevertheless there was fear of an enemy landing, and the archipelago had guard stations and cannons. After the end of the Winter War there was a Danish battalion of 600 volunteer men on the archipelago for a few months. There were about 800 air strike alarms from 1939 to 1944, but the bombers mostly targeted Helsinki, Lahti or Kotka. During the Winter War Loviisa was bombed twice, and two citizens died. The bombings in the Continuation War were concentrated on the summers of 1941 and 1944, there were also two casualties. There is no record of the total number of Loviisa citizens killed during the wars. The new cemetery has 92 war hero graves, but not all of them were registered in Loviisa. In spring 1941 the Finnish Brother-in-Arms Association started to produce a Military Village project to the southwestern side of Myllyharju together with Ragnar Nordström. About 20 residential buildings were built at the Military Village, of which Nordström financed the most. The 200th anniversary of Loviisa was celebrated in 1945 with President of Finland Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim attending.

Nordström had already started a successful business career in the 1920s. In 1922 he founded a corporation named Lovisa Stevedoring, and during the next years he bought the majority of Lovisa Ångfartyg A.B. The company acquired its first steamship meant for international traffic in 1927. Around 1930 Nordström&#x27;s shipping and cargo businesses started to form an entire concern. In spring 1931 he founded the company Loviisan Kalastus Oy and equipped his ships to catch herring at the Icelandic waters. In August the first shipment of herring reached Valko. Except for the war years, the catch of herring on Nordström&#x27;s ships continued for over twenty years. The Nordström concern was at its largest in the 1950s when it employed 1700 people, of which over 700 lived in Loviisa.

=== From 1950 onwards ===

The land surface area of Loviisa grew to over two times its size from 1920 to 1970. Antinkylä had already practically changed from a rural village to a city district when it was annexed to Loviisa in 1924. On the other hand, the annexation of Valko, which had also belonged to Pernå, to Loviisa caused much controversy. The city of Loviisa had bought large areas of land from the Valko area already in the early 20th century, and the annexation had been under plans for half a century until it was finally decided in 1956. In the same year it was confirmed that the state would take care of the railway between Valko and Lahti and widen its tracks (the railway has only served cargo traffic since 1981). The island of Hästholmen which had belonged to Ruotsinpyhtää was annexed to Loviisa in 1969 because of the upcomin nuclear power plant. The city of Loviisa had owned the lands of the island and its surrounding, and sold them to the nuclear power company Imatran Voima a few years earlier.

The two largest companies in Loviisa - the Nordström concern and Rauma-Repola - were under great difficulties in the middle 1960s, so building a nuclear power plant in the city was seen as important. In 1965 the city council received news of Imatran Voima&#x27;s plans to build a nuclear power plant on the shores of the Gulf of Finland, and the mayor Gunnar Wahlström started proposing Loviisa as the site of the plant. Because of political reasons, the decision to build the plant was delayed, and construction only started in 1970. The machinery installations in autumn 1975 raised employment in Loviisa to its top figure at 3900 people. In March 1977 President of Finland Urho Kekkonen and Premier of the Soviet Union Alexei Kosygin inaugurated the first nuclear power plant unit. The deal of building another similar unit in Loviisa had been signed in August 1971. The unit was completed in 1980. The power plants had utilised large amounts of western technology right from the start, and their usage levels have reached international top rankings.

From 1983 to 1985 a state granary was built in the Valko harbour, containing sixteen silos slightly over 80 metres tall. The bypass to the north of the city centre could be taken into use in 1989. The extension of the highway between Porvoo and Koskenkylä to Loviisa had been completed five years earlier. In 1999 the part of the highway between Porvoo and Koskenkylä had been changed to a motorway. In the early 2010s the motorway was extended from Koskenkylä to Kotka and Hamina (the current motorway reaches up to the Vaalimaa border station against Russia). In 1995 the city of Loviisa celebrated its 250th anniversary and professor Sirén&#x27;s history of the city was published in Finnish and Swedish.

Pernå, Liljendal and Ruotsinpyhtää were annexed to Loviisa on 1 January 2010. The annexation was done according to the municipalities&#x27; own proposals, Lapinärvi had decided not to undergo annexation. At the same time, the area of Haavisto-Vastila which had belonged to Ruotsinpyhtää was annexed to the municipality of Pyhtää. The annexation was led by Loviisa mayor Olavi Kaleva. The new municipality received an annexation grant of about 6.2 million euro from the state. Kaleva resigned from his post in spring 2017. The reason for his resignation was disagreement with the city council. In December 2017 Kaleva was succeeded by Jan D. Oker-Blom for a fixed term of seven years. In October 2018 the board of the Suomen Asuntomessut cooperative decided to award the 2023 event to Loviisa.

== Geography ==
Loviisa is located 77 kilometres to the east of Helsinki (as the crow flies). The closest neighbouring municipalities are Porvoo to the west and Kotka to the east. Of the surface area of the municipality of Loviisa, 819.81 square kilometres are land, 25.83 square kilometres are inland waters and 905.88 square kilometres are sea. The land area of Loviisa is larger than that of Porvoo or Kotka, and even larger than those of Helsinki, Vantaa and Espoo put together. There are about forty lakes in the municipality, of which the largest is Hopjärvi (Tammijärvi is even larger but only a small part of it is located in Loviisa). Other large lakes include Lappominjärvi, Sarvalaxträsket, Särkjärvi and Teutjärvi. The rivers of Koskenkylänjoki, Loviisanjoki and Taasianjoki, as well as the western branches of the Kymi river run through Loviisa.

=== Central conurbation ===
The Finnish Museum Board has declared the Esplanadi area in Loviisa around the market square as a nationally significant cultural area. Esplanadi has also been chosen as the cultural landscape of the year in the Western Kymi cultural road in 2019. The principal buildings in the area include the pink city hall (Georg Theodor Chiewitz 1862), the Neo-Gothic Loviisa church (Georg Theodor Chiewitz and Julius Basilier 1865) and Finland&#x27;s oldest surviving wooden social club (Georg Theodor Chiewitz 1863 and Selim A. Lindqvist 1907). Historical districts in the central conurbation include the city centre and the districts of Alakaupunki, Garnisoni and Uusikaupunki. Alakaupunki was spared in the 1855 fire, and it contains the auxiliary building of the Degerby horse stead dating from the 1690s. It is one of Finland&#x27;s oldest wooden buildings. Uusikaupunki was built as a workers&#x27; district to the west of the railway station in the early 20th century.

Other districts include Uusi teollisuusalue, Vanha teollisuusalue, Pohjoistulli, Panimonmäki, Hakalehto, Ulrika, Määrlahti, Rauhala, Eteläharju, Antinkylä, Bella, Haravankylä, Köpbacka and Valko. Valko is both a residential district and a harbour and industrial district. The districts of Määrlahti, Rauhala, Eteläharju and Valko contain suburban apartment building areas.

The western entrance area to the centre of Loviisa along the Finnish National Road 7 started to be called Kuningattarenportti (&quot;Queen&#x27;s gate&quot;) in the early 2010s, and developed into an area of shops and business buildings. At the same time, a new large residential area was planned to the Harmaakallio area to the west of the central conurbation, but only a small part of it has been completed. A new residential area named Kuningattarenranta is being built on the eastern shore of the Loviisanlahti bay, which will host the 2023 event of the Asuntomessut fair.

=== Conurbations ===
According to the definition given by the Finnish Statistics Centre, Loviisa has seven conurbations in addition to the central conurbation. Of these three are parishes: Liljendal, Pernå and Ruotsinpyhtää. The St. Michael&#x27;s church built in Pernå in the 15th century is the oldest building in Loviisa. Two of the conurbations - Koskenkylä and the Ruotsinpyhtää parish - have been built around ironworks areas. The Koskenkylä ironworks area is mainly closed to visitors, whereas Strömfors in Ruotsinpyhtää is open for tourism. Other than the central conurbation, the largest conurbations in the municipality are Koskenkylä and Tesjoki, both with about a thousand inhabitants. In late 2019 Loviisa had 14,772 inhabitants, of which 10,904 lived in conurbations, 3,728 in dispersed settlements and 140 at unknown locations. Of the population of Loviisa, 74.5% lived in conurbations.

=== Countryside and archipelago ===
There are numerous manors in Loviisa, of which the most are located in the western part of the municipality. The manor concentration of Sjögård, Tervik and Tjusterby in Pernåviken dating from the Middle Ages forms a nationally significant cultural area. Other historically significant manors include the Suur-Sarvilahti manor near the central conurbation, the Malmgård manor in the northwestern part of the municipality and the Kulla manor in the east. The manors are in private ownership, only a few of them (Malmgård, Labby, Suur-Sarvilahti and Kulla) are even partly open to the public.

Of the tens of villages in Loviisa the Pernå parish, Fasarby, Horslök and Härkäpää are historically significant. Fasarby is a group village dating from the Middle Ages consisting of old business houses for soldiers. The village is located in the southwestern part of the municipality at the bottom of the Fasarbyviken bay, and its current buildings consist of paired houses built in the 18th and 19th centuries and mansard roof villas built in the 1920s. The archipelago villages of Horslök and Härkäpää (Swedish: Härpe) are located in Sarvisalo. Both villages date from the Middle Ages, and they have exceptionally well preserved their appearance from the early 20th century. There is a windmill built in the 19th century in Härkäpää.

The island of Sarvisalo has a surface area of 27.4 square kilometres and is the largest island in Loviisa, with a permanent connection to the mainland. Other large islands include Gäddbergsö, Kampuslandet and Keipsalo. The island of Hästholmen is known for the Loviisa nuclear power plant, and the Svartholm fortress is one of the most famous tourist destinations in Loviisa. After the Crimean War the fortress was left to decay, but it has been restored led by the Finnish Museum Board since the 1960s. There is a pilot station in Orrengrund and a lightouse in Tiiskeri (Swedish: Digskär). There has previously been pilot activity in Boistö and the neighbouring island of Lehtinen (Swedish: Lövö), but they now host accommodation services and meeting facilities. Boistö hosted secret negotiations between Russia and the United States about the situation in Ukraine in summer 2014.

The building of the sea fortress of Svartholm, located to the south from the city, was begun at the same time as the fortification of Loviisa. The purpose of the sea fortress was to protect the city from the sea, as well as to offer safe haven for the Swedish coastal navy. A joint Anglo-French navy unit destroyed the battlements of the island during the naval warfare in the Gulf of Finland. No longer fit for use the fortress was left to decay. As of the 1960s the fortress has been restored led by the Finnish Heritage Agency. The restoration was brought to a conclusion in time for the 250th jubilee of the fortress in 1998.

During the summers various programmes are arranged on the island of Svartholm for both locals and tourists. The guided tours, an exciting adventure for juniors and a restaurant lure both boaters and people travelling by the ferry boat, which does regular traffic between Loviisa centre and Svartholm.

Loviisa is also renowned for its Old Town. The Old Town was spared from the great fire of 1855. An annex of the Degerby estate, dating from the 17th century, is located in the Old Town. The building is one of the oldest surviving wooden houses in Finland. In Loviisa there is also a high society clubhouse, the only one of its kind in Finland spared from fires. Having been restored it now is a library/mediatheque. The first church in Loviisa was destroyed during the fire. The current Neo-Gothic church was inaugurated in 1865.

The German Brandenstein division landed in Valko in Loviisa on 7 April 1918. The division advanced as far as to Lahti, before returning to Loviisa in order to leave the country on 16 December 1918, as Germany had lost World War I.

The summers are lively in Loviisa. The most popular summer events are the Historical Houses of Loviisa (an event for traditional house building and renovating), the Sibelius Days, the Loviisa Day on 25 August and the King Arrives in Loviisa (a weekend in the spirit of the 18th century), Small Ships&#x27; Race (festival for traditional small sailing ships), the Peace Forum and the horse trotting contests.

The old school building is also made of logs and was renovated at the same time. The central school was completed in autumn 2020.

The construction of the new Swedish-speaking senior stage primary school in the centre of Loviisa - Lovisavikens skola - used slightly more modern wood materials, cross-laminated timber elements and laminated beam bars.

<text>Metro Daily () was the Hong Kong edition of Metro, which publishes free newspapers around the world with 25 editions in 16 countries in 14 languages. It was the first free newspaper in Hong Kong.

The Hong Kong version was first launched on 15 April 2002; it is distributed for free in the racks located in 49 Mass Transit Railway (MTR) stations except the Airport Station.

According to the Hong Kong Audit Bureau of Circulations in September 2002, the daily circulation of the newspaper was 302,197 copies, making it the third largest daily newspaper in Hong Kong. The paper is distributed from Monday to Friday (except for public holidays), by hand or from the newspaper stands in 49 MTR stations and 11 other key central locations, such as big shopping malls owned by MTR Corporation Limited like Paradise Mall, Telford Plaza, and Luk Yeung Galleria.

Though around one tenth size of other newspapers printing local first-hand news reported by fresh journalists, its main news sources are actually the television, radio news, press releases and wired news. Metro Daily is for the most part published in Chinese, with an English language international section. Despite being a tabloid, i.e. a minute-sized newspaper giving the stories in a condensed form, it includes many sections and is very rich in content. These sections include:
*local news (including one page written in Simplified Chinese);
*Chinese news;
*international news;
*finance;
*sports;
*entertainment;
*side stories;
*English news digest;
*editorial column;
*television program schedule; and
*film section.

Readers can read the on-line edition of &quot;Metro&quot; all over the world by simply registering as users at its official site, and it is totally free. Besides, there is also a club called &quot;Club Metro&quot; offering discounts in films, sports and travel to its members.

<doc id="267965" wikidata="Q41413" url="?curid=267965" title="Ismoil Somoni Peak">
<text>Ismoil Somoni Peak (; ) is the highest mountain in Tajikistan, as well as the former Russian Empire and Soviet Union before Tajikistan&#x27;s independence. The mountain is named after Ismail Samani, a ruler of the Samanid dynasty. It is located in the Pamir Range.

==Name==
When the existence of a peak in the Soviet Pamir Mountains higher than Lenin Peak was first established in 1928, the mountain was tentatively identified with Mount Garmo. However, as the result of the work of further Soviet expeditions, it became clear by 1932 that they were not the same, and in 1933 the new peak, in the Academy of Sciences Range, was named Stalin Peak (), after Joseph Stalin. In 1962, as part of Khrushchev&#x27;s nationwide de-Stalinization process, the name was changed to Communism Peak ( ), a name by which it is still commonly known. The name Communism Peak was officially dropped in 1998 in favour of the current name, commemorating the 9th-10th century Samanid emir, Ismail Samani.

==History==
By the end of the 1880s, a Russian expedition, led by V.F. Oshanin, conducted research named various regions in the area. He noted in his diary: &quot;I believe that the eastern peak has a height of up to .&quot; The central Pamirs would continue to be visited by the expeditions of Kosineko, Korzhenevsky, Lipsky, Novitsky, Musketov, and others, but they failed to reach the Academy of Sciences Range.

In 1913, the central part of the Pamirs was explored by an expedition led by the German mountain explorer and climber . The expedition penetrated the upper reaches of the Obikhingou River, where they saw a 6650 m peak. It was given the name Garmo Peak, according to the name given by the Tajiks from Pashimgar. Subsequent expeditions to the area of the Range of the Academy of Sciences took place in Soviet times. 

In 1928, the long-term Tajik-Pamir expedition of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR began to operate, which began with the Soviet-German expedition with the participation of Willi Rickmers. As a result of topographic survey, it was found that one of the peaks visible in the west of the Fedchenko glaciers reaches a height of 7495 m. Having compared the survey results with a schematic map compiled by Korzhenevsky back in 1925, and with other data, the members of the expedition of the Academy of Sciences decided that this peak is Garmo Peak, which was mapped by the German expedition of 1913. However, this led to the &quot;mystery of the Garmo&quot;, as there was a discrepancy between the heights: 6650 m and 7495 m. This was solved only during the expeditions of 1931 and 1932, when two detachments of climbers and topographers (led by Gorbunov and Krylenko) penetrated the area from the east and from the west. The 6650 m peak was determined to be the real Garmo, and the unnamed 7495 m peak was conclusively discovered and mapped, and given the name Stalin Peak in honor of Stalin&#x27;s upcoming 55th birthday.

The first ascent (to the then Stalin Peak) was made on 3 September 1933 by the Soviet mountaineer Yevgeniy Abalakov, during the Tajik-Pamir expedition of 1933.

The first woman to ascend to the peak was Lyudmila Agranovskaya in 1969.

The first winter ascent was made in February 1986 by 24 climbers (7 from Uzbekistan, and 17 from the rest of the USSR).

<doc id="267968" wikidata="Q768526" url="?curid=267968" title="Tyranni">
<text>The Tyranni (suboscines) are a suborder of passerine birds that includes more than 1,000 species, a large majority of which are South American. It is named after the type genus &quot;Tyrannus&quot;. These have a different anatomy of the syrinx musculature than the oscines (songbirds of the larger suborder Passeri), hence the common name of &quot;suboscines&quot;.

The suboscines originated in South America about 50 million years ago and dispersed into the Old World likely via a trans-Atlantic route during the Oligocene. Their presence in the early Oligocene of Europe is well documented by several fossil specimens.

==Systematics==
The suborder Tyranni is divided into two infraorders: the Eurylaimides and the Tyrannides. The New Zealand wrens in the family Acanthisittidae are placed in a separate suborder Acanthisitti.

The phylogenetic relationships of the 16 families in the Tyranni suborder is shown below. The cladogram is based on a large molecular genetic study by Carl Oliveros and collaborators published in 2019: The families and the species numbers are from the list maintained by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOC).
The Eurylaimides contain the Old World suboscines – mainly distributed in tropical regions around the Indian Ocean – and a single American species, the sapayoa:
* Philepittidae: asities
* Eurylaimidae: typical broadbills
* Calyptomenidae: African and green broadbills
* Sapayoidae: broad-billed sapayoa
* Pittidae: pittas
The Tyrannides contain all the suboscines from the Americas except the broad-billed sapayoa. The families listed here are those recognised by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union.
* Pipridae: manakins
* Cotingidae: cotingas
* Tityridae: tityras, sharpbill, becards (includes &quot;Oxyruncus&quot; and &quot;Onychorhynchus&quot;)
* Tyrannidae: tyrant-flycatchers (includes &quot;Piprites&quot;, &quot;Platyrinchus&quot;, &quot;Tachuris&quot; and &quot;Rhynchocyclus&quot;)
* Melanopareiidae: crescent chests
* Conopophagidae: gnateaters and gnatpittas
* Thamnophilidae: antbirds
* Grallariidae: antpittas
* Rhinocryptidae: tapaculos
* Formicariidae: antthrushes
* Furnariidae: ovenbirds and woodcreepers (includes Dendrocolaptidae)

This group has been separated into three parvorders by Sibley &amp; Ahlquist. However, DNA:DNA hybridization did not reliably resolve the suboscine phylogeny. It was eventually determined that there was a simple dichotomy between the antbirds and allies (tracheophones), and the tyrant-flycatchers and allies. Given that the &quot;parvorder&quot; arrangement originally advanced is obsolete (see e.g. Irestedt &quot;et al.&quot; 2002 for tracheophone phylogeny) — more so if the Eurylaimides are elevated to a distinct suborder — it is better to rank the clades as superfamilies or, if the broadbill group is considered a separate suborder, as infraorders. In the former case, the name Furnarioidea would be available for the tracheophones, whereas &quot;Tyrannoidea&quot;, the &quot;bronchophone&quot; equivalent, has not yet been formally defined.
In the latter case, the tracheophones would be classified as &quot;Furnariides&quot;,
while the Tyrannides would be restricted to the tyrant-flycatchers and other &quot;bronchophone&quot; families.

The tracheophones contain the Furnariidae, Thamnophilidae, Formicariidae (probably including most tapaculos), and Conopophagidae. The tyrant-flycatcher clade includes the namesake family, the Tityridae, the Cotingidae, and the Pipridae.

<text>This list ranks metropolitan areas in Europe by their population according to three different sources; it includes metropolitan areas that have a population of over 1 million.

==Sources==
List includes metropolitan areas according only to the studies of ESPON, Eurostat, and OECD. For this reason some metropolitan areas, like the Italian Genoa Metropolitan Area (with a population of 1,510,781 as of 2010) or the Ukrainian Kryvyi Rih metropolitan area (with a population of 1,170,953 as of 2019), are not included in this list, with data by other statistic survey institutes.

Population figures correspond to the populations of Functional urban areas (FUA). The concept of a functional urban area defines a metropolitan area as a core urban area defined morphologically on the basis of population density, plus the surrounding labour pool defined on the basis of commuting.
Figures in the first two population columns use a harmonised definition of a Functional urban area developed jointly in 2011, with delimitation basing on the DEGURBA method.

Further information on how the areas are defined can be found in the source documents. These figures should be seen as an interpretation, not as conclusive fact.

==Student services==

Student Union of the University of Oulu (; &quot;OYY&quot;) provides services to and supervises the interests of all undergraduate degree students in the University of Oulu. All bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree students at the University of Oulu belong to the Student Union. By paying the Student Union membership fee, students are entitled to a student card which allows them to get student services and discounts. This way, students get inexpensive or free medical and dental care from Finnish Student Health Services, (; &quot;YTHS&quot;) traveling discounts in trains and buses, student meals reduction, etc.

There are a number of students organizations or so-called student guilds presented within the University. 
===Student housing===

Student Housing Foundation of Northern Finland (; &quot;PSOAS&quot;) is the leading provider of student accommodation in Oulu. The organization operates on a foundation basis which ensures affordable rents for students. Following its mission, PSOAS offers housing services for people studying in Oulu as economically as possible. The residents of PSOAS houses in different areas around the city elect tenant committee for that area, which e.g. organises different activities, maintains club rooms and does other related issues, depending on the active members.

The new international student house, named Aurora, was built next to PSOAS housing office in downtown Oulu. The building was finished during the spring of 2013. The house is supposed to be accommodated both by international degree students and Finnish students. The main purpose of the new building is to support the internationalization of Oulu and give the international students better access to Finnish culture and local people. The premises will also support these efforts: More space is dedicated for casual get-togethers, as there is a lounge space on every floor and a café of high level will be serving both Finnish and foreign customers on the ground floor.

The International Student Barometer 2019 ranked the University of Oulu first in the world when it comes to internet access and sixth in overall life satisfaction.

<doc id="267976" wikidata="Q1547546" url="?curid=267976" title="Grosses vollständiges Universal-Lexicon">
<text>The Grosses vollständiges Universal-Lexicon aller Wissenschafften und Künste () is a 68-volume German encyclopedia published by Johann Heinrich Zedler between 1731 and 1754. It was one of the largest printed encyclopedias ever, and the first to include biographies of living people in a systematic way.

==Title==
The bookseller and publisher Zedler published this book in Leipzig under the name:&quot;Great Complete Encyclopedia of All Sciences and Arts Which So Far Have Been Invented and Improved by Human Mind and Wit: Including the Geographical and Political Description of the Whole World with All Monarchies, Empires, Kingdoms, Principalities, Republics, Free Sovereignties, Countries, Towns, Sea Harbors, Fortresses, Castles, Areas, Authorities, Monasteries, Mountains, Passes, Woods, Seas, Lakes ... and also a Detailed Historical and Genealogical Description of the World&#x27;s Brightest and Most Famous Family Lines, the Life and Deeds of the Emperors, Kings, Electors and Princes, Great Heroes, Ministers of State, War Leaders... ; Equally about All Policies of State, War and Law and Budgetary Business of the Nobility and the Bourgeois, Merchants, Traders, Arts.&quot;Zedler himself called his encyclopedia &quot;Zedler&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; (&quot;Zedlersches Lexikon&quot;). Many previous encyclopedias were associated with the names of their authors, but the &quot;Universal Lexicon&quot; was the first to be associated with the name of its publisher.

==Editors==
The main editors were Jacob August Franckenstein (volumes 1-2), Paul Daniel Longolius (volumes 3-18), and Carl Günther Ludovici (volumes 19-64 and supplements). Each seems to have taken a different approach to encyclopedia-making. From volume 18 onward, for example, the encyclopedia contains numerous biographies of living people, presumably because of Ludovici&#x27;s appointment as editor around the same time.

In his introduction to volume 1, Zedler himself claimed to have had the encyclopedia compiled by nine anonymous &quot;muses.&quot; Scholars continue to debate over how many or few collaborators he actually had. In fact, almost nothing certain is known about the individual authors of the encyclopedia. Heinrich Winkler wrote many medical articles, and Friedrich August Müller probably wrote articles on philosophy. Lorenz Christoph Mizler (1711–1778) claimed to have written mathematical articles. Johann Heinrich Rother and Johann Christoph Gottsched have also been suggested as possible collaborators, though both denied it. 

==Printing==
The &quot;Grosses vollständiges Universal-Lexicon&quot; is sometimes considered the first modern encyclopedia in the German language. At the time, it was the largest printed encyclopedia in the Western world, and it remains one of the largest. It was originally supposed to be printed in about 12 volumes, an estimate later extended to 24, but it was finally printed in 64 volumes plus four supplements, with about 284,000 articles on 63,000 two-column pages. Ludovici had even intended to write a further four supplements.

Initial production was funded through subscription, where buyers paid in advance and received a discount on the volume that was later delivered. The pressrun of the &quot;Universal Lexicon&quot; was undoubtedly small. Scholars have estimated that only around 1500 sets were printed.

Zedler arranged to have the encyclopedia printed in the Halle Waisenhaus (&quot;orphanage&quot;), not far from Leipzig. This printshop belonged to August Hermann Francke&#x27;s Francke Foundations.

Later, between 1961 and 1964, the book was republished in Graz, Austria.

== Online copy ==
The Bavarian State Library&#x27;s digitisation center in Munich (&quot;Münchener Digitalisierungszentrum&quot;, MDZ) has digitized the encyclopedia completely, including the four supplements, in the form of images and PDF files. The 68 volumes have an index and readers can browse through the pages.

<text>Candace Bushnell (born December 1, 1958) is an American author, journalist, and television producer. She wrote a column for &quot;The New York Observer&quot; (1994–96) that was adapted into the bestselling &quot;Sex and the City&quot; anthology. The book was the basis for the HBO hit series &quot;Sex and the City&quot; (1998–2004) and two subsequent movies.

Bushnell followed this with the international bestselling novels &quot;4 Blondes&quot; (2001), &quot;Trading Up&quot; (2003), &quot;Lipstick Jungle&quot; (2005), &quot;One Fifth Avenue&quot; (2008), &quot;The Carrie Diaries&quot; (2010) and &quot;Summer and the City&quot; (2011). Two of her novels have been adapted for television: &quot;Lipstick Jungle&quot; (2008–09) on NBC, and &quot;The Carrie Diaries&quot; (2013–2014) on The CW. &quot;One Fifth Avenue&quot; has been optioned by the Mark Gordon Company and ABC for another television show.

==Early life==
Bushnell was born in Glastonbury, Connecticut. She is the daughter of Calvin L. Bushnell and Camille Salonia. Her father was one of the inventors of the air-cooled hydrogen fuel cell used in the Apollo space missions in the 1960s. Her Bushnell ancestors in the U.S. can be traced to Francis Bushnell, a signatory of the Guilford Covenant, who emigrated from Thatcham, Berkshire, England, in 1639. Her mother was of Italian descent.

While attending Glastonbury High School, Candace was accompanied to her senior prom by Mike O&#x27;Meara, later a nationally syndicated radio host, who also dated Candace&#x27;s sister, Lolly. She attended Rice University and New York University. She moved to New York in the late 1970s and frequented Studio 54. In 1995, she met publishing executive Ron Galotti, who became the inspiration for &quot;Sex and the City&#x27;s&quot; Mr. Big.

==Career==
At age 19, Bushnell moved to New York City and sold a children&#x27;s story (which was never published) to Simon &amp; Schuster. She continued writing and worked as a freelance journalist for various publications, struggling to make ends meet for many years. Bushnell began writing for &quot;The New York Observer&quot; in 1993. She created a humorous column for the paper (1994–1996) called &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, based on her dating experiences and those of her friends. In 1997, Bushnell&#x27;s columns were published in an anthology, also called &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, and soon became the basis for the popular HBO television series of the same name. The series aired from 1998 to 2004, and starred Sarah Jessica Parker as Carrie Bradshaw, a socially active New York City sex and lifestyles columnist, a character whom Bushnell has said was her alter ego. The series entered syndication and was also made into two films: &quot;Sex and the City&quot; (2008) and &quot;Sex and the City 2&quot; (2010). A third film was announced in December 2016, but was canceled and replaced by the sequel miniseries &quot;And Just Like That…&quot;, on HBO Max. Bushnell went on to publish several international and &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestselling novels including &quot;Four Blondes&quot;, &quot;Trading Up&quot;, &quot;Lipstick Jungle&quot; and &quot;One Fifth Avenue&quot;. 

In 2005, Bushnell served as one of three judges for the reality television show &quot;Wickedly Perfect&quot; on CBS. She began hosting a live weekly talk show on Sirius Satellite Radio in 2007. The show, called &quot;Sex, Success and Sensibility,&quot; was canceled in late 2008 after the merger of Sirius and XM Satellite Radio, when Bushnell was asked to continue the show with a 50% pay cut and refused. Bushnell won the 2006 Matrix Award for books, and the Albert Einstein Spirit of Achievement Award. In 2009 she wrote a comedic web series, The Broadroom, about women over 40 dealing with workplace issues. It starred Jennie Garth and was created in partnership with the magazine publisher Meredith Corporation&#x27;s &quot;Meredith 360&quot; division.

Bushnell&#x27;s 2005 novel &quot;Lipstick Jungle&quot; was adapted for television and aired on NBC in 2008. The series &quot;Lipstick Jungle&quot; starred Brooke Shields and ran for 20 episodes. In 2009, Bushnell wrote articles for Meredith&#x27;s &quot;More&quot; magazine.

In 2008, HarperCollins contracted Bushnell to write two books for young adults about Carrie Bradshaw&#x27;s high school years. The first of these, &quot;The Carrie Diaries&quot;, was published in 2010. The other, &quot;Summer and the City (Carrie Diaries Series #2)&quot;, was published in 2011. &quot;The Carrie Diaries&quot; was a number one &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller.

In 2012, Bushnell was sued in federal court by her former friend and manager Clifford Streit (who inspired the &quot;Sex and the City&quot; character Stanford Blatch), who claimed that Bushnell reneged on a settlement in which she agreed to pay him 7.5% of anything she earned from the &quot;Sex and the City&quot; TV series and the two &quot;Sex and the City&quot; movies, an amount Streit estimated was at least $150,000.

==Personal life==
From 2002 to 2012, Bushnell was married to Charles Askegard, a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet who was ten years her junior, and whom she had met eight weeks before. They divorced in 2011. She found the experience disorienting, telling &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;When I got divorced, I couldn’t get a mortgage; I didn’t fit into a computer model. All of a sudden, I was invited to no more couple things. Being single is hard and there’s something a bit heroic about it.&quot;

She owned a co-op in Greenwich Village until 2015. From 2005 to 2016 she owned a historic Victorian farmhouse in Roxbury, Connecticut. In 2016, she bought a co-op on East 74th Street in Manhattan.

<doc id="267995" wikidata="Q1138512" url="?curid=267995" title="Meyers Konversations-Lexikon">
<text>&#x27; or &#x27; was a major encyclopedia in the German language that existed in various editions, and by several titles, from 1839 to 1984, when it merged with the .

Joseph Meyer (1796–1856), who had founded the publishing house in 1826, intended to issue a universal encyclopaedia meant for a broad public: people having a general knowledge as well as businessmen, technicians and scholars, considering contemporary works like those of and to be superficial or obsolete.

==First edition==

The first part of &quot;&quot; (&quot;Great encyclopaedia for the educated classes&quot;) appeared in October 1839. In contrast to its contemporaries, it contained maps and illustrations with the text.

There is no indication of the planned number of volumes or a time limit for this project, but little headway had been made by the otherwise dynamic . After six years, 14 volumes had appeared, covering only one fifth of the alphabet. Another six years passed before the last (46th) volume was published. Six supplementary volumes finally finished the work in 1855. Ultimately numbering 52 volumes, &quot; was the most comprehensive completed German encyclopedia of the 19th century, also called &quot; (The marvellous Meyer). The complete set was reprinted 1858–59.

==Later editions==
The son of , (1826–1909), published the next edition (which is officially the first), entitled , 1857–60, that would only count 15 volumes. To avoid a long-time project, subscribers were promised it would be completed within three years, and all volumes appearing later would be given free. Of course, it was finished right on time.
The 2nd edition, &#x27;, appeared 1861–67; the 3rd edition, now from Leipzig, was issued as &#x27; 1874–78; both had 15 volumes.

The 4th edition, consisting of 16 volumes, appeared in 1885–90, with 2 supplements of update pages, volume 17 (1891) and volume 18 (1892). The 5th edition had 17 volumes, &quot;, 1893 to 1897. This edition sold no less than 233,000 sets.

The 6th edition, entitled &#x27;, was published 1902–08. It had 20 volumes, and the largest sale of all editions, with 240,000 sets. The First World War prevented an even bigger success. There was also the small 1908 edition, &#x27;.

The 6th edition of the encyclopedia, and all previous editions, are in the public domain in Germany, the United States, and all countries where the copyright term of anonymous or pseudonymous works is 100 years or fewer since publication.

===World Wars and destruction===
The 7th and 8th editions were both briefly named &#x27;. The 7th edition counted only 12 volumes, due to the economic depression of the 1920s. It appeared in 1924–30. It came with a condensed single-volume version known as the &#x27;.

The 8th edition (1936–42) remained incomplete due to wartime circumstances: out of 12 planned volumes only volumes number 1 through 9 plus the atlas volume number 12 could be issued. Due to its brown binding in addition to the fact that it was filtered through the Nazi censorship it has come to be known as &quot; (&quot;The Brown Meyer&quot;), as brown became the colour associated with the Nazis.

The buildings of the company were completely destroyed by the bombing raids on Leipzig in 1943–44 and the company itself expropriated in 1946 without compensation. In 1953 the place of business was moved to Mannheim in West Germany (); a &quot; remained in Leipzig.

===9th edition and ===
The 9th edition, now from Mannheim, entitled &quot; (in 25 volumes), appeared in 1971–79. Just like the first, this final edition was the most comprehensive German encyclopaedia of the century.

From Leipzig (then in East Germany) came &quot; (1961–64, 8 volumes; 2nd edition 1971–78, 18 volumes), embedded in the Marxist ideology.

==Merger with ==
In 1984, the &#x27; amalgamated with its biggest competitor in field of reference books &#x27; of Wiesbaden, in a so-called &quot; (wedding of elephants). Being aware that the new firm&#x27;s program did not provide room for two similar works of this magnitude, it was decided that the big serial reference works coming from Mannheim would henceforth be marketed under the name of .

<text>Daniel Jackson Evans (October 16, 1925 – September 20, 2024) was an American politician from the state of Washington. A member of the Republican Party, he served as a member of the Washington House of Representatives from 1957 to 1965, governor of Washington from 1965 to 1977, and in the United States Senate from 1983 to 1989.

Following his service in the United States Navy, Evans was elected to the Washington House of Representatives in 1956. He then served as Republican leader of the House before being elected governor in 1964. He was reelected twice more in 1968 and in 1972. Described as a moderate Republican, particularly on social and environmental issues, Evans supported Nelson Rockefeller for the Republican nomination for president in 1968 and refused to endorse Richard Nixon, despite giving the keynote address at that year&#x27;s Republican National Convention.

Evans was considered a potential candidate for vice president of the United States during his time as governor, but was never chosen. In 1983, he was appointed to the United States Senate following the death of Henry M. Jackson, and was elected in a special election in November and served until 1989, declining to run again. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living former U.S. senator and the second-oldest living American governor.

== Early life and education ==
Evans was born on October 16, 1925, in Seattle, Washington, to Lester Evans and the former Irma Alice Ide, descended from a family that had first arrived in the Washington Territory in 1859; his maternal grandfather had served in one of the first state senates in Washington. He was of Welsh descent. He grew up in the Laurelhurst neighborhood, and attended Roosevelt High School.

As a young man, Evans was an Eagle Scout, and served as a staff member and Hike Master at Camp Parsons, a well known Boy Scout camp in Washington. As an adult, he was awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America in 1973.

After high school, Evans served in the United States Navy from 1943 to 1946. He first entered the V-12 Navy College Training Program, and was stationed at the University of Washington (UW), but was transferred eight months later to a Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps program at the University of California, Berkeley. He did not see combat; he was deployed to the Pacific Ocean shortly after the end of World War II, as a commissioned ensign on a succession of aircraft carriers, before returning to UW in 1946.

Evans graduated from the University of Washington with degrees in civil engineering (Bachelor of Science, 1948; Master of Science, 1949). The UW later (in 2007) gave him the distinction of Alumnus Summa Laude Dignitatus, the highest distinction the university confers on its graduates. He returned to the United States Navy (1951–1953) before working as a structural engineer (1953–1956); in the latter capacity, he helped draw up the plans for the Alaskan Way Viaduct.

== Political career ==
Evans served in the Washington State House of Representatives from 1957 to 1965 before being elected governor.
Despite being a Republican and a self-styled conservative, Evans became known for his administration&#x27;s liberal policies on environmentalism (he founded the country&#x27;s first state-level Washington State Department of Ecology, which became Nixon&#x27;s blueprint for the United States Environmental Protection Agency) and strong support of the state&#x27;s higher education system, including founding Washington&#x27;s system of Washington Community and Technical Colleges. In addition, he signed a bill to legalize abortion in the first four months of a pregnancy and fought unsuccessfully for a state income tax, two additional liberal positions.

== Governor of Washington 1965–1977 ==
Evans announced his campaign for governor in December 1963. He was elected in 1964, defeating incumbent Democratic governor Albert Rosellini, and served until 1977, one of three to be elected to three terms, after Arthur B. Langlie and later Jay Inslee, in Washington state history. A 1981 University of Michigan study named him one of the ten outstanding American governors of the 20th century. He declined to run for a fourth term in 1976. Jay Inslee joined both Langlie and Evans, becoming the third Washington governor to serve three terms with his re-election victory in 2020.
Serial killer Ted Bundy served as one of hundreds of campaign volunteers for Evans. Despite rumors, Evans never met Bundy. During the 1972 campaign, Bundy followed Evans&#x27;s Democratic opponent around the state, tape recording his speeches, and reporting back to a campaign aide. A minor scandal later followed when the Democrats found out about Bundy, who had been posing as a college student.

From 1977 to 1983, Evans served as the second president of Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, which Evans had created in 1967 by signing a legislative act authorizing the formation of the college. The largest building on the Evergreen campus is named the Daniel J. Evans Library, in his honor.

Evans was named as a potential running mate for Richard Nixon in 1968, but he declined to be considered. Gerald Ford considered nominating him for the vice presidency in 1974, after he succeeded Nixon mid-term, and as a possible running mate for the 1976 election.

== United States Senator 1983–1989 ==
In 1983, Governor John Spellman appointed Evans to the United States Senate, to fill a seat left vacant by the death of long-time senator Henry M. Jackson. Evans won a special election later that year against Mike Lowry, and filled the remainder of Jackson&#x27;s unexpired term, retiring from politics after the 1988 elections. He was unhappy during his tenure in the Senate, writing in a 1988 column in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; that &quot;debate has come to consist of set speeches read before a largely empty chamber&quot; and adding that he felt demoralized by &quot;bickering and protracted paralysis&quot;.

Evans voted in favor of the Passage of Martin Luther King Jr. Day establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday, and the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (as well as to override President of the United States Ronald Reagan&#x27;s veto). Evans voted in favor of the failed Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States, but Robert Bork was not confirmed.

== Later life and death ==
After leaving the Senate in 1989, Evans founded his own consulting firm, Daniel J. Evans Associates. Governor Mike Lowry appointed him to the Board of Regents of the University of Washington in 1993; Evans served as the board&#x27;s president from 1996 to 1997, and in 1999, the Evans School of Public Policy and Governance at the University of Washington was named for him. Evans also went on to work in media, doing an editorial weekly on the KIRO-TV newscasts from the early- to mid-1990s. In 2012, Evans was listed as a director of the Initiative for Global Development. His autobiography was published in 2022. Evans became the oldest living former U.S. senator following the death of James L. Buckley in August 2023. On January 26, 2024, his wife of 64 years, Nancy Ann Evans died at age 90 of breast cancer.

Evans died at his home in Seattle on September 20, 2024 at age 98, almost eight months after his wife&#x27;s death. He was the last living former U.S. senator born in the 1920s.

== Wilderness preservation efforts ==
Evans was a Boy Scout whose early experiences hiking in the Olympic Mountains nurtured a life-long love of wilderness. Evans supported Congress&#x27; creation of North Cascades National Park in 1968. As governor, he persuaded U.S. President Gerald Ford to sign a 1976 legislation creating the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, when the United States Forest Service was urging a veto.
Evans sponsored the million-acre Washington Park Wilderness Act as a U.S. senator, and legislation creating the national scenic area in the Columbia River Gorge. In 1989, Evans co-founded the Washington Wildlife and Recreation Coalition, with Mike Lowry. In 2017, Olympic Wilderness at Olympic National Park was renamed to Daniel J. Evans Wilderness, in honor of Evans.

== Personal life ==
Evans married the former Nancy Ann Bell, a native of Spokane, Washington on June 6, 1959 at Westminster United Church of Christ in the Cliff/Cannon neighborhood of Spokane. Together, they had three sons, Daniel J. Evans Jr., Mark Evans, and Bruce Evans; and nine grandchildren.

== Early life and education ==
John Stephen Goodman was born on 20 June, 1952 in Affton, Missouri. His father, Leslie Francis Goodman, was a postal worker who died of a heart attack when Goodman was two years old. Goodman&#x27;s mother, Virginia Roos (&quot;née&quot; Loosmore), was a waitress at Jack and Phil&#x27;s Bar-B-Que, a retail store worker, and also took in laundry to support the family. Goodman has an older brother, Leslie, who is 14 years his senior, and a younger sister, Elisabeth, who was born six months after his father died. Goodman is of English, German, and Welsh ancestry and was raised Southern Baptist.

Goodman described his childhood as alone and withdrawn after his father had died so early and his brother had left to go to college. Goodman was bullied at school for being overweight. Until ninth grade, Goodman was in the Boy Scouts, which he said offered him the structure and camaraderie he missed; Goodman additionally looked to Boy Scout leaders, and later, acting coaches, as father figures. His brother later returned home to help raise Goodman and his sister. As a child, Goodman spent a lot of time listening to the radio and reading comic books, initially subscribing to DC&#x27;s &quot;Green Lantern&quot; and &quot;The Atom&quot;, before turning to Marvel Comics. He also read his brother&#x27;s copies of &quot;Mad&quot; and later confessed to shoplifting its paperback editions. Goodman credits his brother with introducing him to comedy and bebop.

Goodman went to Affton High School, where he played football (offensive guard and defensive tackle) and dabbled in theater. After graduating in 1970, Goodman took a gap year. He earned a football scholarship to Missouri State University (then called Southwest Missouri State University, or &quot;SMSU&quot;) in Springfield but tore his ACL before ever suiting-up to go onto the field. Instead, Goodman channeled his energy into the school&#x27;s theater program.

Goodman pledged Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity, though he did not join until several years later. Goodman discovered the university&#x27;s drama program and studied there with future Hollywood stars Kathleen Turner and Tess Harper. In December 2013, Goodman stated his school friends were his closest ones. Goodman graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1975, and in 2013, the university presented him with an honorary doctorate degree in humane letters.

== Career ==
=== 1980–1999: Film roles and &quot;Roseanne&quot; ===
After graduating from SMSU, Goodman relocated to New York City. With a small bankroll from his brother, Goodman found an apartment in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen near the Theater District and unsuccessfully tried to make money as a bartender and waiter. However, Goodman eventually found modest success in voice-overs, commercials, and plays. He was the person who slapped himself (uttering the tagline, &quot;Thanks... I needed that!&quot;) in a television ad for Skin Bracer by Mennen. Goodman also performed off-Broadway and in dinner theaters before landing character roles in film during the early 1980s.

In 1982, Goodman made his film debut with a small role in &quot;Eddie Macon&#x27;s Run&quot;. During this period he continued to work on the stage, starring as Pap Finn in &quot;Big River&quot; from 1985 to 1987. For his role, he received a Drama Desk nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Musical; he is also featured on the Original Broadway Cast Recording. Before landing his big break into movies in 1986 with a significant comedic role in &quot;True Stories&quot;, he starred in the movie &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot;, and later had a brief cameo as Otis in &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;. In the former film, his character Louis Fyne says &quot;I&#x27;m 6&#x27; 3&quot; and maintain a consistent panda bear shape&quot;, establishing his trademark size as an important part of many characters he later played on film and stage.
Goodman rose to fame in acting by playing the role of Dan Conner on the ABC sitcom &quot;Roseanne&quot; from 1988 to 1997. He returned to the character in 2018 for the revived, 10th season, where he said &quot;Roseanne and I just went back to having a ball&quot;, and then stayed on for the show&#x27;s subsequent spin-off &quot;The Conners&quot;. Goodman had a long history of appearances on late night comedy shows and was the first guest on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, which won him the series&#x27; &quot;First Guest Medal&quot; (Goodman joked he would pawn the medal for a bottle of cheap Scotch). Goodman has hosted NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; 13 times, while also making seven cameo appearances as Linda Tripp during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, three appearances as Rex Tillerson, and cameoing on the season 28 finale hosted by former &quot;SNL&quot; cast member Dan Aykroyd. With little to no experience in TV comedy, Goodman auditioned to be a cast member for Jean Doumanian&#x27;s tumultuous 1980–1981 &quot;SNL&quot; season and was rejected, along with up-and-coming comedians Jim Carrey, Paul Reubens, and Robert Townsend.

Goodman first worked with the Coen Brothers on &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; (1987). He went on to appear in their films &quot;Barton Fink&quot; (1991), &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; (1998), &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; (2000), and &quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot; (2013). Only Steve Buscemi has appeared in more Coen works (six films), though Frances McDormand and Jon Polito have also appeared in five of their films. He worked with Steven Spielberg on &quot;Always&quot; (1989) and had a supporting role in &quot;Arachnophobia&quot; (1990). In 1993, he starred as a William Castle-type filmmaker in &quot;Matinee&quot; opposite Cathy Moriarty, and in 1994 as Fred Flintstone in &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. Other films included &quot;King Ralph&quot; (1991), &quot;The Babe&quot; (1992), &quot;Fallen&quot; (1998), &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot; (1998), and &quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot; (1999).

===2000–2009: Established star ===

Goodman had guest roles on the Aaron Sorkin television dramas &quot;The West Wing&quot; and &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;. In the former, he appeared in four episodes, playing Speaker of the House and eventual acting president Glen Allen Walken. In the latter, Goodman appeared as Pahrump, Nevada Judge Robert Bebe, earning a 2007 Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actor – Drama Series for his performance.

Goodman voiced Robot Santa in the character&#x27;s first appearance on &quot;Futurama&quot;. Starting in 2007, he has been the voiceover in Dunkin&#x27; Donuts commercials. In 2000, Goodman provided the voice of Pacha in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; and, a year later, the voice of James P. &quot;Sulley&quot; Sullivan in Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; He returned to the character for the film&#x27;s 2013 prequel &quot;Monsters University&quot; (2013), the 2021 Disney+ series &quot;Monsters at Work&quot;, and for a 2024 update of the video game &quot;Disney Dreamlight Valley&quot;. In 2007, Goodman voiced Layton T. Montgomery in &quot;Bee Movie&quot;. Two years later, he voiced &quot;Big Daddy&quot; La Bouff in &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot;. Goodman&#x27;s voice can also be heard on an automated message system at St. Louis Lambert International Airport. He was the original voice of the yellow M&amp;M in 1995 before being replaced by J. K. Simmons the following year.

In theater, Goodman played the Ghost of Christmas Present in the 2008 Kodak Theatre production of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, starring Christopher Lloyd as Ebenezer Scrooge. Goodman played the role of Pozzo in a Studio 54 revival of Samuel Beckett&#x27;s play &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, opposite Bill Irwin and Nathan Lane. John Heilpern of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; called it &quot;the greatest Pozzo I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; In 2009, Goodman reprised the role of Pozzo at the Roundabout Theatre Company.

Goodman was cast in &quot;In the Electric Mist&quot; (2009) as Julie &quot;Baby Feet&quot; Balboni. At one time, he was slated to play the role of Ignatius Reilly, the main character of &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; by John Kennedy Toole. The story takes place almost entirely in New Orleans. However, the movie was never put into production. In &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot;, Goodman lent his voice as Eli &quot;Big Daddy&quot; La Bouff also takes place in New Orleans. Goodman was also featured in &quot;Treme&quot;, a drama series focusing on a group of interconnected people trying to rebuild their lives in post–Hurricane Katrina New Orleans. Goodman played Creighton Bernette, a Tulane English professor, in the show&#x27;s first season. Other films during this time included &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; (2000), &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot; (2000), &quot;Storytelling&quot; (2001), &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot; (2004), &quot;Evan Almighty&quot; (2007), &quot;Speed Racer&quot; (2008), and &quot;Pope Joan&quot; (2009).

=== 2010–present ===

In 2011, Goodman was a guest star on the third season of &quot;Community&quot;. He also voiced a character in the video game &quot;Rage&quot; voicing Dan Hagar, and played movie studio chief Al Zimmer in the Academy Award–winning live action film &quot;The Artist&quot;, as well as Best Picture nominee &quot;Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close&quot; the same year. Also in 2011, Goodman starred in Kevin Smith&#x27;s &quot;Red State&quot; playing ATF Agent Joseph Keenan. In February 2012, it was reported that Goodman would reunite with Roseanne Barr for a new NBC pilot titled &quot;Downwardly Mobile&quot;. The series would have had Goodman portray a bachelor mechanic who resides in a trailer park, and would have used the standard multiple-camera setup traditionally found in sitcoms; however, the series&#x27; option was not picked up by the network. 

During this time Goodman took prominent roles in films including &quot;Flight&quot; (2012), &quot;The Hangover Part III&quot; (2013), &quot;The Monuments Men&quot; (2014), &quot;Trumbo&quot; (2015), &quot;10 Cloverfield Lane&quot; (2016), &quot;Patriots Day&quot; (2016) and &quot;Atomic Blonde&quot; (2017). Goodman also voiced Hound in &quot;&quot; (2014) and returned to the character in &quot;&quot; (2017). With his well-received supporting roles in &quot;The Artist&quot; (2011) and &quot;Argo&quot; (2012), Goodman accomplished the rare feat of appearing in back-to-back winners of the Academy Award for Best Picture.

On August 10, 2013, Goodman was inducted as a Disney Legend. That same year, he received positive reviews for his performance as U.S. senator from North Carolina Gil John Biggs in Amazon&#x27;s &quot;Alpha House&quot;, a political comedy written by Garry Trudeau. In the show, Goodman&#x27;s character, a retired University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) basketball coach, and three other Republican senators share a house on Capitol Hill. The show ended after two seasons in 2014. In April 2015, Goodman made his return to the stage, making his West End debut in the process while starring as Donny in &quot;American Buffalo&quot; at the Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre alongside Damian Lewis and Tom Sturridge. Goodman went on to star as Sheriff Hartman in the 2016 Broadway revival of &quot;The Front Page&quot;, alongside Nathan Lane and John Slattery.
On March 10, 2017, Goodman received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in motion pictures, located at 6767 Hollywood Boulevard. On April 28, 2017, it was announced that a revival of &quot;Roseanne&quot; was in the works and that Goodman along with most of the original cast and some of the producers would return for the limited series that was being shopped around with ABC and Netflix the frontrunners to land the show. On May 16, 2017, it was confirmed that eight episodes would air mid-season in 2018 on ABC. On May 29, 2018, in the wake of controversial remarks made by Barr on Twitter regarding Valerie Jarrett (an advisor of former president Barack Obama), ABC canceled the revival after a single season. The next month, ABC ordered a ten-episode &quot;Roseanne&quot; spin-off titled &quot;The Conners&quot;, which stars the &quot;Roseanne&quot; cast sans Roseanne Barr. The show&#x27;s first season premiered on October 16, 2018.

In 2019, Goodman starred in the role of Southern megachurch preacher and family patriarch Eli Gemstone on the HBO comedy &quot;The Righteous Gemstones&quot;, created by and co-starring Danny McBride. Goodman accepted the role right after the revived &quot;Roseanne&quot; series had been cancelled and before its spin-off &quot;The Conners&quot; was announced, which led to Goodman doing both shows. &quot;The Righteous Gemstones&quot; was renewed for a second season in September 2019. In 2020, Goodman served as the conductor narrator for the virtual train ride welcome video at the St. Louis Aquarium that opened at St. Louis Union Station. In 2023, Goodman appeared in &quot;&quot;, as the older Bill Randa, reprising his role from &quot;&quot; (2017).

=== Health ===
In a 2009 interview, Goodman discussed his struggles with alcoholism:

In October 2012, Goodman stated: &quot;If I&#x27;d picture in my mind a drink—usually straight out of the bottle—I couldn&#x27;t not do it,&quot; noting that while acting in plays he would &quot;have the shakes so bad I&#x27;d have to have a drink to get through the show. I&#x27;m lucky I never got fired.&quot; Sober since 2007, Goodman tries to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting every morning.

Goodman was once known for his sizable frame, at one point weighing close to . However, by August 2010, Goodman had lost through a program of exercise and food journaling. His new figure attracted attention at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2015 and the BFI London Film Festival in October 2015. By June 2024, it was reported that Goodman had lost over 200 pounds.

Goodman suffers from depression. He has attributed the severity of the condition to past alcohol consumption and treats his depression through physical exercise.

<text>Creflo Augustus Dollar Jr. (born January 28, 1962) is an American pastor, televangelist, and the founder of the non-denominational Christian World Changers Church International based in College Park, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. Dollar also heads the Creflo Dollar Ministerial Association (formerly called International Covenant Ministries), Creflo Dollar Ministries, and Arrow Records.

==Career==
Dollar began developing World Changers Ministries Christian Center in 1986. He held the church&#x27;s first worship service in the cafeteria of Kathleen Mitchell Elementary School in College Park, with eight people in attendance. He later renamed the ministry World Changers Church International (WCCI), and the congregation moved from the cafeteria to a dedicated chapel. Four services were held each Sunday, and Creflo added a weekly radio broadcast and the television show &quot;Changing Your World&quot;.

On December 24, 1995, WCCI moved into its present location, the 8,500-seat facility known as the World Dome. The church has said that the nearly $20 million World Dome was built without any bank financing. , the congregation reported having around 30,000 members, and $70 million in revenue (gross cash collections) for 2006.

In October 2012, Creflo Dollar Ministries leased Loews Paradise Theater in The Bronx for a new church location in New York.

In November 2018, CBS News listed WCCI as the 29th largest megachurch in the United States with about 15,000 weekly visitors.

Dollar also speaks at conferences and writes about his gospel of wealth and his involvement in televangelism.

==Personal life==
Dollar and his wife Taffi have five children and reside in Atlanta, Georgia.

In June 2012, Dollar was arrested for an alleged attack on his fifteen-year-old daughter, according to the Fayette County, Georgia, Sheriff&#x27;s Office.
Dollar was accused of choking and punching the girl, a story corroborated by Dollar&#x27;s older daughter, and Fayette County police released details of a subsequent 911 call. The charges were dropped in January 2013 after he attended anger management classes.

==Finances and prosperity gospel teachings==
Dollar is known for controversial teachings regarding prosperity theology. He has long been criticized for living a lavish lifestyle. He owns two Rolls-Royces, a private jet, and high-end real estate such as a million-dollar home in Atlanta, a $2.5 million home in Demarest, New Jersey, and a home in Manhattan that he bought for $2.5 million in 2006 (equivalent to $ million in ) and sold for $3.75 million in 2012 (equivalent to $ million in ). Dollar has refused to disclose his salary. For declining to disclose any financial information to independent audit, Creflo Dollar Ministries received a grade of &quot;F&quot; (failing) for financial transparency by the organization Ministry Watch.

Dollar was among six televangelists who were the subject of a 2007 investigation led by United States Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa as ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. Grassley asked for financial information to determine whether Dollar made any personal profit from financial donations and requested that Dollar&#x27;s ministry make the information available by December 6, 2007. The investigation also asked for information from five other televangelists: Benny Hinn, Kenneth Copeland, Eddie L. Long, Joyce Meyer, and Paula White. Dollar contested the probe, arguing that the proper governmental entity to examine religious groups is the IRS, not the Committee on Finance. Dollar and three others were not cooperative, and the probe concluded in 2011 without any charges.

In May 2015, Dollar asked his congregation to buy him a $65 million Gulfstream G-650 jet which caused scrutiny. In response to his critics, Dollar said in a sermon, &quot;If I want to believe God for a $65 million plane, you cannot stop me. You can&#x27;t stop me from dreaming, I&#x27;m going to dream until Jesus comes.&quot; 

===Tithe retraction views===

Over the years, Dollar has written books and made video recordings about the obligation for Christians to pay tithe in the churches. However, in July 2022, he publicly retracted his views on tithing confessing that he has misled people with these teachings, stating that it was not biblical to tithe but up to individuals to offer according to their heart and ability. Dollar received praise and criticism for these statements.

<text>Roberta Lynn Williams (; born February 16, 1953) is an American video game designer and writer, who co-founded Sierra On-Line with her husband, game developer Ken Williams. In 1980, her first game, &quot;Mystery House&quot;, became a modest commercial success; it is credited as the first graphic adventure game. She is also known for creating and maintaining the &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; series, as well as designing the full motion video game &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot; in 1995.

Sierra was acquired by CUC International in 1996, leading to layoffs and management changes. Williams took a brief sabbatical, and returned to the company in a game design role, but grew increasingly frustrated with CUC&#x27;s creative and business decisions. After the release of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest: Mask of Eternity&quot; in 1998, she left the game industry in 1999 and focused her retirement on traveling and writing historical fiction. In 2021 she released her historical novel, &quot;Farewell to Tara&quot;. Soon after, she returned to game development with the 3D remake of the classic adventure game &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot;, released in January 2023 as &quot;Colossal Cave&quot;.

Several publications have named Roberta Williams as one of the best or most influential creators in the video game industry, for co-founding Sierra, pioneering the graphic adventure game genre, and creating the &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; series. Several publications have called her the &quot;Queen of adventure games&quot;. She has received the Industry Icon Award from The Game Awards, and the Pioneer Award at the Game Developers Choice Awards.

==Early life and career==
Born in Los Angeles, Roberta Heuer grew up in rural Southern California as the daughter of an agricultural inspector. A shy child with a vivid imagination, she often created fairy-tale adventure stories to entertain her family. She would lie in bed and imagine fantastical situations, which she sometimes described as her &quot;movies&quot;. She met her future husband Ken Williams when they were both teenagers, and the two began dating. After high school, she became a clerk at the Los Angeles County Welfare Department, in part thanks to her father&#x27;s connections working in local government. In late 1972, Roberta married Ken just a few days after his eighteenth birthday, and gave birth to their first son in November 1973. The couple briefly moved to Illinois, where she was employed as a computer operator, soon moving back to Los Angeles where she took a job at Lawry&#x27;s Foods as a computer programmer working in COBOL.

By 1979, the couple had two children. Ken was employed as a computer programmer and consultant, working on large IBM mainframe machines. They wanted to leave Los Angeles to fulfill their dream of living in the woods. As Ken brainstormed ideas for a technology business that could become viable outside of a major city, Roberta purchased an Apple II computer for the family, which strained their expenses. Roberta&#x27;s love of computers grew as she played several text adventure games.

==Game design career==
===Early graphic adventure games (1979–1983)===

Around 1979, Roberta Williams was an avid player of text adventures on her teletype machine, particularly as a fan of &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot;. She was inspired to speak to her husband Ken Williams about her vision for what a video game could be, drawing influence from Agatha Christie&#x27;s story &quot;And Then There Were None&quot;, and the board game &quot;Clue&quot;. Roberta convinced Ken to provide the technical knowledge to program the game, while she contributed her experience with fiction and storytelling. Roberta drew the pictures using her Apple II and a Versawriter, a graphics tablet that could be used to hand-trace a piece of paper and input the image into a computer. Since no programs existed to read the Versawriter image, Ken had to write one, eventually compressing nearly seventy images onto a disk.

The result was &quot;Mystery House&quot;, an adventure game with black and white graphics for the Apple II computer. Released in 1980, the game was distributed by mail order, advertised in computer magazines under the name of Ken&#x27;s consulting company, On-Line Systems. The game soon sold ten thousand copies, with Roberta personally packing the disks and supporting materials in Ziploc bags, and answering her home phone to provide hints for the game&#x27;s puzzles. Ken began to personally distribute copies of the game to computer stores. He quit his consulting job, with hopes that it would allow the couple to eventually move out of the city.

They released the &quot;Wizard and the Princess&quot; later that year, improving on their previous title with color graphics and dithering. The game sold 60,000 copies, leading them to hire more employees for distribution and programming. Encouraged by the success of their first two games, On-Line Systems switched its focus from consulting to game development. Roberta&#x27;s ambitions grew with the design of &quot;Time Zone&quot;, a time-travelling game spanning thousands of years, which was released on twelve disks in 1982. Around this time, Roberta&#x27;s parents retired and moved to Oakhurst, California, and she hoped to move close by. With their company expanding, the couple was finally able to move On-Line Systems from Simi Valley, California to Coarsegold. They also changed their company name to Sierra On-Line, based on its location near the Sierra Nevada mountains.

After just two years Sierra had grown to nearly a hundred employees with $10million in revenue. Sierra&#x27;s success started to attract investors, including venture capitalists. Around this time, Jim Henson approached Ken Williams to create a game adaptation of &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;, before the film&#x27;s release. Roberta was excited by the project, believing video games to be a facet of entertainment as much as film. She designed much of the game adaptation on paper; it was finalized and released in 1983. The high-profile game caused the company to attract mainstream media attention, and Roberta hoped that the entertainment industry would not just recognize the value of games, but also the value of the artists who created them.
===&quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; breakthrough (1983–1994)===
By 1983, Sierra&#x27;s new investors pushed the company to diversify into video game cartridges for platforms such as the Atari. The video game industry soon experienced a crash, and Sierra&#x27;s board of directors began to push a merger with Spinnaker Software, an educational software company. When Spinnaker presented their proposal to the Sierra board, Roberta proclaimed, &quot;These guys are a joke. No one in the industry respects them. Can&#x27;t we talk about something productive?&quot; Although Ken Williams was amenable to the deal, Roberta strongly opposed it, and the merger did not proceed. Sierra was forced to downsize to 30 employees, and the Williams family mortgaged their home to pay their remaining employees.

Sierra had cultivated a strong relationship with IBM as the IBM PC was being developed, and &quot;Wizard and the Princess&quot; was one of the first games released for the computer under the title &quot;Adventure in Serenia&quot;. Around the time of Sierra&#x27;s financial difficulties, IBM offered to invest in the struggling company, with hopes of creating a game that could showcase the technical capabilities of their upcoming IBM PCjr. Roberta had wanted to build on her experience with &quot;The Wizard and the Princess&quot; with a fully animated adventure game, in a pseudo-3D world. This led to the 1984 release of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot;, conceived as a blend of common fairy tales that could be directly experienced as a game. Although the PCjr was considered a failure, &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; was ported to many other platforms and quickly rose to bestseller status. The game was considered revolutionary for its pseudo-3D elements, becoming the first adventure game to allow the player character to move in front of, behind, or over other objects on the screen. It was also the first computer game to support the 16-color EGA standard, setting a new standard for future graphic adventure games.
Meanwhile, Roberta continued her role as designer of the &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; series, which earned a reputation for its unique style of storytelling, as well as its increasingly advanced graphics and technology. The 1986 release of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest III: To Heir is Human&quot; was larger and longer than previous games in the series, and earned a ranking on Time&#x27;s list of 50 Best Video Games of All Time. When &quot;King&#x27;s Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella&quot; was released in 1988, it was one of the first games to receive sound card support, and one of the first adventure games to support a mouse. It was also one of the first games to feature a female protagonist, a creative decision that Williams seeded by introducing the character in the previous game. Some of her peers cautioned that this might deter men from playing the game, but it was even more commercially successful than previous installments. A post-release survey revealed that most men did not mind playing as a female protagonist, whereas many female players preferred the experience. Sierra received registration cards for the game with a near 40% female audience, leading journalists to credit Williams with expanding the player base for personal computer games. &quot;King&#x27;s Quest IV&quot; has been considered one of the most influential video games of all time, impacting the design of games such as &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; and other LucasArts adventure games.
Williams continued to design other titles, such as the educational title &quot;Mixed-Up Mother Goose&quot;. The game went on to sell more than 500,000 copies, and the CD-ROM version earned the Software Publishers Association Excellence in Software Award for Best Early Education Program. In 1989, Williams released another mystery adventure game called &quot;The Colonel&#x27;s Bequest&quot;, which iterated on ideas from her original &quot;Mystery House&quot; game with more detailed graphics and improved text parsing. The game was still rare for featuring a female protagonist, and deviated from the traditional adventure game formula to become more of an interactive mystery, putting more onus on the player to discover the plot. The 1990 release of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest V&quot; became the first game to use an icon-based interface, continuing the series&#x27; innovations in game design. The game was critically acclaimed, winning several awards upon release, with &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; including it in their 1996 list of greatest games of all time.

By the early 1990s, Sierra was a publicly traded company, generating $100million per year in revenue. The company released &quot;The Dagger of Amon Ra&quot; in 1991, a sequel to &quot;The Colonel&#x27;s Bequest&quot; based on characters and concepts created by Williams. Meanwhile, Williams worked with Jane Jensen to design &quot;King&#x27;s Quest VI.&quot; Released in 1992, it was recognized by several publications as one of the best adventure games, if not one of the best games overall. By the mid 1990s, Williams was considered the company&#x27;s most popular game designer, particularly for her success with the &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; series. The saga is still remembered as the only video game series created and maintained by a female designer.
===Later games and career exit (1995–1999)===
Williams branched out from her work on &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; by designing &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot;, a realistic horror adventure game. As a long time fan of the novels of Stephen King, she had often contemplated whether it was possible to create a terrifying video game. Because she believed it would be difficult to make a truly frightening game without live actors, the game was created entirely in full-motion video. The production ultimately cost $4million, with a team of nearly two hundred people and a script of more than five hundred pages. Designed as a mature title for adults, the game was marketed as an interactive film, and published on seven CD-ROMs. Although &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot; received a mixed critical reception, it was one of the most commercially successful adventure games and Sierra&#x27;s bestselling game, selling more than a million copies upon its release in 1995. Williams recalls the game as her favorite achievement.

In 1996, Sierra was sold to CUC International for more than a billion dollars in stock. Roberta had opposed the deal, and several other high-ranking Sierra employees had felt there was something suspicious about CUC&#x27;s financials. Roberta ultimately acquiesced, recognizing that the terms of the deal were too favorable to refuse, and that she could be sued by their shareholders if she failed to maximize their value. The company&#x27;s management and decision-making dramatically changed under CUC, leading Ken Williams to leave his role at Sierra and work directly for their new parent company. The CUC restructuring also led to lay-offs. Roberta Williams took a sabbatical from the game industry, as the company released &quot;The Roberta Williams Anthology&quot;, a compilation of 14 games.

Roberta Williams returned to game development in early 1997 to work on &quot;King&#x27;s Quest: Mask of Eternity&quot;. She hoped to re-introduce some interactivity absent in &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot;, and to embrace the advances in 3D graphics technology. Sierra had changed significantly as a company, and its new management insisted on adding elements from popular role-playing games such as &quot;Diablo&quot;, while straying from the game&#x27;s traditional adventure elements. When she removed certain role-playing elements, the team would re-add them, leading to a power struggle with management. Roberta&#x27;s frustrations with her lack of control were coupled with suspicions of CUC, after allegations of financial fraud had surfaced about the company. Worried about the company&#x27;s future, she talked to Ken about selling their stock. The couple soon divested from the company, Ken resigning at the end of 1997, and Roberta staying to finish &quot;Mask of Eternity&quot;. Released in 1998, the game was considered a commercial and critical disappointment, leading to further layoffs, and the sale of Sierra to Vivendi. That year, CUC was convicted of financial fraud, having exaggerated their revenues by more than half a billion dollars (equivalent to $million in ). The decline of Sierra had an emotional impact on Roberta, who left the company in 1999. By the 2000s, Sierra&#x27;s assets were held by Activision Blizzard, after a merger between Activision and Vivendi.

==Retirement==
After the release of &quot;King&#x27;s Quest: Mask of Eternity&quot;, Roberta Williams described herself as taking a sabbatical from the game industry in 1999. In actuality, both she and Ken had signed a non-compete clause with CUC that prevented them from working in the game industry for five years. According to Ken, &quot;By the time the five years were up, we had moved on to other ventures,&quot; thus ending Roberta&#x27;s career in the game industry after 18 years and 20 games. At that time, she stayed away from the public eye and rarely spoke to the press. In a rare 2006 interview, she said her greatest achievement was creating &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot;, though she expressed her love of the &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; series for its influence on her early career. Williams said that her role as a game designer was in the past, and that she was focused on writing a historical novel. She has also focused on travel, becoming an avid sailor with her husband.

In 2011, the video game website Gamezebo reported that she had returned from her sabbatical as a design consultant on the social network game &quot;Odd Manor&quot;, for Facebook. By 2012, Replay Games had recruited Sierra veterans Al Lowe and Paul Trowe to return to the &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot; adventure game series, which led Trowe to try to persuade the Williamses to return to the game industry. Activision hired Telltale Games to develop a new entry in the &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; series. Williams declined to work on the game, but did offer some advice. The game was later canceled in 2013. Activision attempted to revive the Sierra brand in 2014, leading developer The Odd Gentlemen to create &quot;King&#x27;s Quest: A Knight to Remember&quot;. According to the studio, they consulted with Roberta Williams &quot;to make a game like they would make if they had continued making adventure games&quot;.

In 2019 Vancouver Film School announced The Roberta Williams Women in Game Design Scholarship, in partnership with game studios The Coalition and Blackbird Interactive. In 2021, Williams self-published her first novel &quot;Farewell to Tara&quot;, set in mid-1800s Ireland during the time of the Great Famine.
Roberta and Ken announced plans to return to game development in June 2021, in collaboration with artist Marcus Maximus Mera. In an interview that same year, she expressed caution that a veteran game designer could successfully return to the industry after an extended break, saying there are merits to ending one&#x27;s career at its peak. In 2022 the team revealed that their new studio Cygnus Entertainment was creating a remake of &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot; titled &quot;Colossal Cave 3D Adventure&quot;. Roberta explained that this pioneering game from the 1970s had inspired her career, and she was excited to re-imagine it as an interactive 3D experience.

==Legacy and accolades==
In 1995, &quot;Next Generation&quot; included Roberta Williams among their list of 75 power players in the game industry. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; also ranked her as tenth on their 1997 list of the most influential people in computer gaming, praising her impact on the design of adventure games. &quot;GameSpot&quot; likewise ranked her number ten on their 1999 list of &quot;the most influential people in computer gaming of all time&quot; for &quot;pushing the envelope of graphic adventures&quot; and being &quot;especially proactive in creating games from a woman&#x27;s point of view and titles that appealed to the mainstream market, all the while integrating the latest technologies in graphics and sound wherever possible&quot;. In 2009, &quot;IGN&quot; included both her and Ken in the 23rd position on the list of top game creators of all time, highlighting their role in co-founding Sierra as &quot;the company behind some of the best and most well known adventure games of the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s&quot;.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; inducted Roberta Williams into their Hall of Fame in 2011. Both Roberta and Ken were given an Industry Icon Award at The Game Awards in 2014. She also earned the Pioneer Award at the 20th Game Developers Choice Awards in March 2020, for her influential work in the graphical adventure game genre with &quot;Mystery House&quot;, as well as her role in creating the &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; series and co-founding Sierra.

Ken Williams has described her as a perfectionist, &quot;extremely smart, intuitive and usually right. She can&#x27;t be managed.&quot; &quot;Ars Technica&quot; has called her &quot;one of the more iconic figures in adventure gaming&quot;, noting her as one of the first well-known female game designers, and praising her writing and design work on &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot; and the &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot; series. &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine has noted her as a pioneer of graphic adventure games, for creating the first home computer game to include graphics. Several publications have referred to her as &quot;the Queen of adventure games&quot;.

Roberta Williams has personally inspired the characters and artwork of other games. She posed for the cover of the game &quot;Softporn Adventure&quot; by Chuck Benton, published by On-Line Systems. She posed much later with her children as Mother Goose for the cover photograph of &quot;Mixed-Up Mother Goose&quot;. She also makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Leisure Suit Larry 3&quot;, where Larry interrupts her while &quot;directing&quot; a scene for &quot;King&#x27;s QuestIV&quot;. Ellie Williams, protagonist of the 2013 video game series The Last of Us is named for Ken and Roberta. She was also a source of inspiration for the character of Cameron Howe in the AMC television drama &quot;Halt and Catch Fire&quot;. The Williams family donated a collection of design materials to the International Center for the History of Electronic Games.

<text>Evolutionary computation from computer science is a family of algorithms for global optimization inspired by biological evolution, and the subfield of artificial intelligence and soft computing studying these algorithms. In technical terms, they are a family of population-based trial and error problem solvers with a metaheuristic or stochastic optimization character.

In evolutionary computation, an initial set of candidate solutions is generated and iteratively updated. Each new generation is produced by stochastically removing less desired solutions, and introducing small random changes as well as, depending on the method, mixing parental information. In biological terminology, a population of solutions is subjected to natural selection (or artificial selection), mutation and possibly recombination. As a result, the population will gradually evolve to increase in fitness, in this case the chosen fitness function of the algorithm.

Evolutionary computation techniques can produce highly optimized solutions in a wide range of problem settings, making them popular in computer science. Many variants and extensions exist, suited to more specific families of problems and data structures. Evolutionary computation is also sometimes used in evolutionary biology as an &quot;in silico&quot; experimental procedure to study common aspects of general evolutionary processes.

== History ==
The concept of mimicking evolutionary processes to solve problems originates before the advent of computers, such as when Alan Turing proposed a method of genetic search in 1948 . Turing&#x27;s B-type u-machines resemble primitive neural networks, and connections between neurons were learnt via a sort of genetic algorithm. His P-type u-machines resemble a method for reinforcement learning, where pleasure and pain signals direct the machine to learn certain behaviors. However, Turing&#x27;s paper went unpublished until 1968, and he died in 1954, so this early work had little to no effect on the field of evolutionary computation that was to develop.

Evolutionary computing as a field began in earnest in the 1950s and 1960s. There were several independent attempts to use the process of evolution in computing at this time, which developed separately for roughly 15 years. Three branches emerged in different places to attain this goal: evolution strategies, evolutionary programming, and genetic algorithms. A fourth branch, genetic programming, eventually emerged in the early 1990s. These approaches differ in the method of selection, the permitted mutations, and the representation of genetic data. By the 1990s, the distinctions between the historic branches had begun to blur, and the term &#x27;evolutionary computing&#x27; was coined in 1991 to denote a field that exists over all four paradigms.

In 1962, Lawrence J. Fogel initiated the research of Evolutionary Programming in the United States, which was considered an artificial intelligence endeavor. In this system, finite state machines are used to solve a prediction problem: these machines would be mutated (adding or deleting states, or changing the state transition rules), and the best of these mutated machines would be evolved further in future generations. The final finite state machine may be used to generate predictions when needed. The evolutionary programming method was successfully applied to prediction problems, system identification, and automatic control. It was eventually extended to handle time series data and to model the evolution of gaming strategies.

In 1964, Ingo Rechenberg and Hans-Paul Schwefel introduce the paradigm of evolution strategies in Germany. Since traditional gradient descent techniques produce results that may get stuck in local minima, Rechenberg and Schwefel proposed that random mutations (applied to all parameters of some solution vector) may be used to escape these minima. Child solutions were generated from parent solutions, and the more successful of the two was kept for future generations. This technique was first used by the two to successfully solve optimization problems in fluid dynamics. Initially, this optimization technique was performed without computers, instead relying on dice to determine random mutations. By 1965, the calculations were performed wholly by machine.

John Henry Holland introduced genetic algorithms in the 1960s, and it was further developed at the University of Michigan in the 1970s. While the other approaches were focused on solving problems, Holland primarily aimed to use genetic algorithms to study adaptation and determine how it may be simulated. Populations of chromosomes, represented as bit strings, were transformed by an artificial selection process, selecting for specific &#x27;allele&#x27; bits in the bit string. Among other mutation methods, interactions between chromosomes were used to simulate the recombination of DNA between different organisms. While previous methods only tracked a single optimal organism at a time (having children compete with parents), Holland&#x27;s genetic algorithms tracked large populations (having many organisms compete each generation).

By the 1990s, a new approach to evolutionary computation that came to be called genetic programming emerged, advocated for by John Koza among others. In this class of algorithms, the subject of evolution was itself a program written in a high-level programming language (there had been some previous attempts as early as 1958 to use machine code, but they met with little success). For Koza, the programs were Lisp S-expressions, which can be thought of as trees of sub-expressions. This representation permits programs to swap subtrees, representing a sort of genetic mixing. Programs are scored based on how well they complete a certain task, and the score is used for artificial selection. Sequence induction, pattern recognition, and planning were all successful applications of the genetic programming paradigm.

Many other figures played a role in the history of evolutionary computing, although their work did not always fit into one of the major historical branches of the field. The earliest computational simulations of evolution using evolutionary algorithms and artificial life techniques were performed by Nils Aall Barricelli in 1953, with first results published in 1954. Another pioneer in the 1950s was Alex Fraser, who published a series of papers on simulation of artificial selection. As academic interest grew, dramatic increases in the power of computers allowed practical applications, including the automatic evolution of computer programs. Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi-dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers, and also to optimize the design of systems.

== Techniques ==
Evolutionary computing techniques mostly involve metaheuristic optimization algorithms. Broadly speaking, the field includes:
*Agent-based modeling
**Ant colony optimization
**Particle swarm optimization
**Swarm intelligence
*Artificial immune systems
*Artificial life 
**Digital organism
*Cultural algorithms
*Differential evolution
*Dual-phase evolution
*Estimation of distribution algorithm

**Evolutionary programming
**Genetic programming
***Gene expression programming
***Grammatical evolution
**Evolution strategy
*Learnable evolution model
*Learning classifier system
*Memetic algorithms
*Neuroevolution
*Self-organization such as self-organizing maps, competitive learning
A thorough catalogue with many other recently proposed algorithms has been published in the Evolutionary Computation Bestiary. It is important to note that many recent algorithms, however, have poor experimental validation.

== Evolutionary algorithms ==

Evolutionary algorithms form a subset of evolutionary computation in that they generally only involve techniques implementing mechanisms inspired by biological evolution such as reproduction, mutation, recombination and natural selection. Candidate solutions to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the cost function determines the environment within which the solutions &quot;live&quot; (see also fitness function). Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.

In this process, there are two main forces that form the basis of evolutionary systems: Recombination (e.g. crossover) and mutation create the necessary diversity and thereby facilitate novelty, while selection acts as a force increasing quality.

Many aspects of such an evolutionary process are stochastic. Changed pieces of information due to recombination and mutation are randomly chosen. On the other hand, selection operators can be either deterministic, or stochastic. In the latter case, individuals with a higher fitness have a higher chance to be selected than individuals with a lower fitness, but typically even the weak individuals have a chance to become a parent or to survive.

=== Evolutionary algorithms and biology ===
Genetic algorithms deliver methods to model biological systems and systems biology that are linked to the theory of dynamical systems, since they are used to predict the future states of the system. This is just a vivid (but perhaps misleading) way of drawing attention to the orderly, well-controlled and highly structured character of development in biology.

However, the use of algorithms and informatics, in particular of computational theory, beyond the analogy to dynamical systems, is also relevant to understand evolution itself.

This view has the merit of recognizing that there is no central control of development; organisms develop as a result of local interactions within and between cells. The most promising ideas about program-development parallels seem to us to be ones that point to an apparently close analogy between processes within cells, and the low-level operation of modern computers. Thus, biological systems are like computational machines that process input information to compute next states, such that biological systems are closer to a computation than classical dynamical system.

Furthermore, following concepts from computational theory, micro processes in biological organisms are fundamentally incomplete and undecidable (completeness (logic)), implying that “there is more than a crude metaphor behind the analogy between cells and computers.

The analogy to computation extends also to the relationship between inheritance systems and biological structure, which is often thought to reveal one of the most pressing problems in explaining the origins of life.

&quot;Evolutionary automata&quot;, a generalization of &quot;Evolutionary Turing machines&quot;, have been introduced in order to investigate more precisely properties of biological and evolutionary computation. In particular, they allow to obtain new results on expressiveness of evolutionary computation. This confirms the initial result about undecidability of natural evolution and evolutionary algorithms and processes. &quot;Evolutionary finite automata&quot;, the simplest subclass of Evolutionary automata working in &quot;terminal mode&quot; can accept arbitrary languages over a given alphabet, including non-recursively enumerable (e.g., diagonalization language) and recursively enumerable but not recursive languages (e.g., language of the universal Turing machine).

<text>Mariehamn ( , ; ; ) is the capital of Åland, an autonomous territory under Finnish sovereignty. Mariehamn is the seat of the Government and Parliament of Åland, and 40% of the population of Åland live in the city. It is mostly surrounded by Jomala, the second-largest municipality in Åland in terms of population; to the east, it is bordered by Lemland. Like the rest of Åland, Mariehamn is unilingually Swedish-speaking and around of the inhabitants speak it as their native language.

The theme of the coat of arms of Mariehamn refers to the city&#x27;s main livelihood, maritime transport, and the city&#x27;s parks, which are typically lined with linden trees. The coat of arms was designed by Nils Byman and confirmed in 1951.

Due to its central location in the Baltic Sea, Mariehamn has become a major summer resort town for global tourism; as many as 1.5 million tourists visit annually.

== History ==
The town was named after the Russian empress Maria Alexandrovna (1824–1880), literally meaning &quot;Marie&#x27;s Port&quot;. Mariehamn was founded on 21 February 1861 around the village of Övernäs, in what was at the time part of the municipality of Jomala. The city has since expanded and incorporated more of Jomala territory. Mariehamn was built according to a very regular scheme which is well-preserved. One of the oldest streets is &quot;Södragatan&quot; where many wooden houses dating from the 19th century can be seen.

In the mid 1800s, the business of cargo shipping started to catch on, and many important shipowners and shipyards took their residence in the developing city.

Following the First World War, Mariehamn was home to the Mariehamn Grain Fleet.

On 8 November 1963 a devastating plane crash occurred in Mariehamn, in which 22 out of 25 people lost their lives, which made it the second-deadliest aviation accident in the history of Finland.

== Transport ==
=== Harbours ===
The city is located on a peninsula. It has two important harbours, one located on the western shore and one on the eastern shore, which are ice-free for nearly the whole year, and have no tides. The Western Harbour is an important international harbour with daily traffic to Sweden, Estonia and mainland Finland. A powerful incentive for Baltic ferries to stop at Mariehamn is that, with respect to indirect taxation, Åland is not part of the EU customs zone and so duty-free goods can be sold aboard. 
Åland and Mariehamn have a reputable heritage in shipping. The Flying P-Liner &quot;Pommern&quot; museum ship (part of the Åland Maritime Museum) is anchored in the Western Harbour. The Eastern Harbour features one of the largest marinas in Scandinavia. The famous Dutch steamer &quot;Jan Nieveen&quot; (now called &quot;F.P. von Knorring&quot;, after Åland teacher and vicar Frans Peter von Knorring) can also be found here.

=== Airport ===
Mariehamn Airport serves the city; it has scheduled flights on two airlines including Finnair.

=== Roads ===
At three of Åland&#x27;s four highways, Mariehamn serves as a starting point for Main Road 1 to Eckerö, Main Road 2 to Sund and Main Road 3 to Lumparland.

== Culture ==
The city is an important centre for Åland media; both of the local newspapers (Ålandstidningen and Nya Åland), several radio stations and the local TV channels (TV Åland and Åland24) operate out of the city. The islanders are traditionally fond of reading, and had public libraries before 1920. A printing works was established in the town in 1891. The municipal library, which was built in 1989, is one of the most interesting modern buildings.

===Museums===
*Åland Maritime Museum
*Åland Museum
*&quot;Pommern&quot; (ship)
*Övernässtugan
*Sjökvarteret

== Architecture ==
=== Architects ===
Mariehamn features several buildings drawn by Finnish architect Lars Sonck, who moved to Åland as a child. Buildings drawn by him include the church of Mariehamn (1927), the main building of the Åland Maritime College (1927) and the town hall (1939). Hilda Hongell also designed several buildings, although only a few are still standing.

=== The Church of St George ===
The main parish church of Mariehamn was opened in 1927 and has been expanded in 1959 and renovated in 1972. when the pews were painted blue. The visible decorations include painted wooden ceiling panels, one for each of the followers of Christ. The unnamed panel is that representing Judas Iscariot. The church paintings and decorations are the work of Finnish artist Bruno Tuukkanen. These include the golden mosaics behind the altar which show the life of Christ. Gifts to the church include the font and the ship that hangs from the ceiling. This is the &quot;Tjerimaj&quot;. The church houses a 37 stop organ built in stages (1969, 1982).

== Demographics ==


== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Mariehamn has a transitional climate between a humid continental climate (Dfb) and an oceanic climate (Cfb) as a result of the strong maritime moderation from being an island in the Baltic Sea. This causes summers to be cooler than both the Swedish and Finnish mainlands, with winters being similar in cold to the adjacent coastal part of Sweden but milder than Finland&#x27;s mainland. The lowest temperature at Mariehamn airport was in February 1979, and the highest temperature on record was in July 2022 and July 1941.

<text>The Binirayan Festival is an annual month-long cultural festival in the province of Antique, Philippines, held every December.

The festival commemorates the arrival of Malay migrants prior to the Spanish conquest, as documented in Maragtas, a compilation of legends and oral history by Pedro Alcantara Monteclaro.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Binirayan&quot; comes from the Karay-a word &quot;biray&quot;, which translates sailboat. The word &quot;Binirayan&quot; literally means &quot;where they sailed to&quot;.

==Date of celebration==
The festival was conceived by Governor Evelio Javier, and first celebrated on January 11–13, 1974. In 1975, the festival was moved to April 25–27, but in the succeeding years was celebrated in December to coincide with the Christmas celebration in the province. In 1981, with the assumption of Governor Enrique A. Zaldivar, it was moved back to April. The festival was not celebrated in 1980, 1984–1987, and 1995 due to political crises. Consequently, the dates of the festival, which has become one of the major festivals in the Western Visayas region has suffered inconsistency with the every change of leadership of the province. In 2002, however, the provincial board of Antique passed a resolution fixing the date of the celebration in April, and when the management of the festival was given to Binirayan Foundation, Inc. the dates were set on the third weekend of April.

In 2011, the date was again changed to December, and ever since, it is being celebrated every December.

==Purpose==
The Binirayan Festival commemorates the legend of the arrival of the ten Bornean datus on the island of Aninipay now known as Panay. (See the legend of Maragtas.) As Governor Evelio B. Javier, the Father of Binirayan Festival, reminded the Antiqueños during the earlier celebrations, &quot;let us gather the strands and memories of our past, as we look back with pride, that we may look ahead with confidence to Antique tomorrow.&quot;

Binirayan Festival&#x27;s permanent theme is &quot;Retracing Roots, Celebrating Culture and Greatness.&quot;

==Events==
The festival opens with a fluvial parade from the Pantalan port to Malandog Beach in Hamtic, believed to be the original settlement of the Bornean datu. In Malandog is a historical marker commemorating this legendary event. There are beauty pageants, cultural shows, street dancing, parades, and arts and crafts local products exhibits. In 2006, the Binirayan Foundation introduced the Komedya Antiqueña as a sub-festival to promote the komedyas traditional folk theater.

===From Ati-ati to Malay-ati===

The ati-ati, now popularly known as &quot;ati-atihan&quot; in Philippine fiestas, used to be one of the main events of the festival. Patterned after the famous ati-ati of Aklan, the Binirayan ati-ati is participated in by people of all walks of life painting their faces with black soot. A tribe competition is held among towns and barangays. The popular tribes during the first decade of the festival were Tribu Kamihanon (Bgy 8), Tribu Bukaka (Bgy 2), Tribu Karintukay Dagatnon (Marina) and Tribu Campan (Kampo-Pantalan). Tribu Kaunlaran (Bgy 3) of Comon under then tribe trainer and choreographer Herman Cortez became a regular winner, that they represented the province in 1981 in the Dinagyang Festival in Iloilo City as Tribu Binirayan. Tribu Binirayan emerged Champion in 1983, the first-ever non-Ilonggo tribe to win the competition. It also boosted the popularity of Binirayan Festival as a major festival in Region VI. In later years, however, the high cost of maintaining tribes, prevented many tribes join the ati-ati competition. In 2001, the Binirayan Executive Committee repackaged the competition as Malay-Ati competition to introduce the idea that the Malays and Ati are the ancestors of the Antiqueños. Current Malay-Ati performance show historical events, folk practices and lifestyles in Antique. The competition in April 2008 was a best of the best among festivals in the province.

===Lin-ay kang Antique===
==Antique International Marathon==
In 2017, a new event is being slated, the Antique International Marathon (AIM). It aims to showcase the pristine nature and hassle free lifestyle of the Antiqueños. It also intends to put the province at the center of sports tourism in the country. AIM will also spark the enthusiasm of the Antiqueños and everyone else to get into sports, go outdoors and have a healthy lifestyle.

Part of the Registration Fee (10.00) will go to the beautification/upkeep of the Malandog River. Malandog River is the site where the Landing of the Ten Malayan Datus took place.

==The Binirayan Confab==

In 2007, Binirayan Foundation convened the Binirayan Confab (initially billed as Binirayan Summit) as a gathering of scholars, academicians, researchers, artists, cultural workers, and almost anyone interested in &quot;Antiqueniana.&quot; The confab serves as the intellectual strand of the festival, because according to the organizers, to make the Binirayan Festival closer to its vision of bringing together Antiqueños to look at their past with pride, and look ahead with confidence. The Binirayan festival is not all raucous revelry, but also a time to think about which direction the province takes.

<text>Shantou, alternately romanized as Swatow and sometimes known as Santow, is a prefecture-level city on the eastern coast of Guangdong, China, with a total population of 5,502,031 as of the 2020 census (5,391,028 in 2010) and an administrative area of . However, its built-up (or metro) area is much bigger with 12,543,024 inhabitants including Rongcheng and Jiedong districts, Jiexi county and Puning city in Jieyang plus all of Chaozhou city largely conurbated. This is de facto the 5th built-up area in mainland China between Hangzhou-Shaoxing (13,035,026 inhabitants), Xi&#x27;an-Xianyang (12,283,922 inhabitants) and Tianjin (11,165,706 inhabitants).

Shantou, a city significant in 19th-century Chinese history as one of the treaty ports established for Western trade and contact, was one of the original special economic zones of China established in the 1980s, but did not blossom in the manner that cities such as Shenzhen, Xiamen and Zhuhai did. However, it remains eastern Guangdong&#x27;s economic centre, and is home to Shantou University, which is under the provincial Project 211 program in Guangdong.
==History==
Shantou was a fishing village part of Tuojiang Du (), Jieyang County during the Song dynasty. It came to be known as Xialing () during the Yuan dynasty. In 1563, Shantou became a part of Chenghai County in Chao Prefecture (Chaozhou). As early as 1574, Shantou had been called Shashanping (). In the seventeenth century, a cannon platform called Shashantou Cannon () was made here, and the place name later was shortened to &quot;Shantou&quot;. Locally it has been referred to as Kialat.

Connecting to Shantou across the Queshi Bridge is Queshi () which had been known by the local people through the 19th century as Kakchio. It was the main site for the American and British consulates. Today the area is a scenic park but some of the structures from its earlier history are somewhat preserved. In 1860, Shantou was opened for foreigners and became a trading port according to Treaty of Tientsin.

It became a city in 1919, and was separated from Chenghai in 1921. 1922 saw the devastating Swatow Typhoon, which killed 5,000 out of the 65,000 people then inhabiting the city. Some nearby villages were totally destroyed. Several ships near the coast were totally wrecked. Other ones were blown as far as two miles inland. The area around the city had around another 50,000 casualties. The total death toll was above 60,000, and may have been higher than 100,000.

In the 1930s, as a transport hub and a merchandise distribution centre in Southeast China, Shantou Port&#x27;s cargo throughput ranked third in the country. A brief account of a visit to the city in English during this period is the English accountant Max Relton&#x27;s &quot;A Man in the East: A Journey through French Indo-China&quot; (Michael Joseph Ltd., London, 1939). On 21 June 1939, Japanese troops invaded Shantou. Japanese forces occupied Shantou until 15 August 1945. The Communist People&#x27;s Liberation Army captured Shantou on 24 October 1949, 23 days after the People&#x27;s Republic of China was founded.

With higher-level administrative authority, Shantou governed Chaozhou City and Jieyang City from 1983 to 1989.

==Geography==
Shantou is located in eastern Guangdong with latitude spanning 23°02′33″ – 23°38′50″ N and longitude 116°14′40″ – 117°19′35″ E; the Tropic of Cancer passes through the northern part of the city, and along it there is a monument, in fact the easternmost in mainland China, at . The highest peak in the city&#x27;s administration is Mount Dajian () on Nan&#x27;ao Island, at ; the highest peak on the geographic mainland is Mount Lianhua (), at in Chenghai District. The city is located at the mouths of the Han, Rong (), and Lian Rivers.

Shantou is northeast of Hong Kong.

<text>Zhuhai is a prefecture-level city located on the west bank of the Pearl River estuary on the central coast of southern Guangdong province, People&#x27;s Republic of China, on the southeastern edge of the Pearl River Delta. Its name literally means &quot;pearl sea&quot;, which originates from the city&#x27;s location at the mouth of the Pearl River meeting the South China Sea. Zhuhai borders Jiangmen to the west, Zhongshan to the north and Macau to the southeast, and shares maritime boundaries with Shenzhen and Hong Kong to the northeast across the estuary.

Zhuhai was one of the original four Special Economic Zones established in 1980, as well as one of China&#x27;s premier tourist destinations, being called the Chinese Riviera. While the city is located in the traditionally Cantonese-speaking province of Guangdong, a significant portion of the population is now made up of Mandarin-speaking economic migrants originally from inland provinces.

The core of Zhuhai, Xiangzhou District along with Macao, in the northeastern portion of the administrative division, are part of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area, the biggest built-up area in the world with more than 65,565,622 inhabitants as of the 2020 census, encompassing Shenzhen, Dongguan, Foshan, Zhongshan, Macau, the main part of Guangzhou, and small parts of Jiangmen and Huizhou cities but with Hong Kong not quite conurbated yet.

According to a report released in 2014 by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Zhuhai is the most liveable city in China. Zhuhai is classified as a Medium-Port Metropolis.

== History ==
Zhuhai has had a long history in the development of the exhibition industry in China. Zhuhai was the first permanent motor racing facility in China and has become a centre for the local racing scene, as well as a semi-regular fixture on the international racing circuit, including the Zhuhai Special Economic Zone.

== Population ==
The population of Zhuhai has experienced steady growth from 2014 to 2023. In 2014, the city&#x27;s population was approximately 1.51 million, which increased to about 2.49 million by the end of 2023.

* 2014: 1.51 million
* 2015: 1.54 million
* 2016: 1.57 million
* 2017: 1.60 million
* 2018: 1.64 million
* 2019: 1.67 million
* 2020: 2.44 million
* 2021: 2.47 million
* 2022: 2.48 million
* 2023: 2.49 million

=== Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge ===
This bridge was first proposed by Gordon Wu and contemplated by stakeholders, municipal governments in the Pearl River Delta, the provincial government of Guangdong, and the central government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). Before the government handover of Hong Kong, the British government also considered plans for a bridge. After 1997 the commercial interests of Hong Kong prompted the local government to consider the plans as well.

On 24 October 2018 the Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge (HZMB) was opened.

== Geography ==
Zhuhai borders the Macau Special Administrative Region (north and west), and is southwest of Guangzhou. Its territory has of coastline and 217 islands, of which 147 are over 500 square metres in area.

The islands within the prefecture-level city of Zhuhai include a number of near-shore islands, often connected to the mainland by bridges or causeways (such as Hengqin, Qi&#x27;ao, or Yeli Islands), as well as some islands in the open South China Sea (the Wanshan Archipelago). Some of the latter are actually geographically closer to Hong Kong than to the Zhuhai mainland. The jurisdiction of Nei Lingding Island, located in the Pearl River estuary was transferred from Zhuhai to Shenzhen in 2009.

==Climate==
Despite being located within the tropics, Zhuhai has a humid subtropical climate affected by the East Asian Monsoon (Koppen classification Cwa) and moderated by the South China Sea, with long, hot and humid summers with frequent thunderstorms, and short, mild and dry winters. Average highs in January and July are respectively. Snowfalls are unknown and a frost has never been recorded in the city centre. Conversely, extreme heat waves do not occur as they do further inland. Being named one of the most liveable cities in China, real estate is robust here. Residents from the mainland, especially those from the North, will buy homes and spend their winters in Zhuhai.
== Economy ==
In 1980 the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) announced that the city of Zhuhai would be one of four special economic zones. Those doing business in the SEZ are eligible for a range of incentives provided by the PRC. Zhuhai became a city in 1979, a year before it was designated as one of the first Special Economic Zones of China (SEZ). Similarly to neighbouring Shenzhen, which became the first Special Economic Zone of China in 1978, the implementation of Zhuhai as an SEZ was largely due to its strategic position adjacent to Macau, a capitalist trading center similar to Shenzhen&#x27;s position with Hong Kong.

The establishment of Zhuhai as an SEZ allowed the Chinese Central Government and economy to have easier access to the Macau and consequently, global market. As a result, Zhuhai is now a major city in the Pearl River Delta region according to the new general urban plan approved by the State Council. The implementation of Special Economy Zone intended for the city to become a key port city, science and education city, scenic and tourism city, and as a regional hub for transportation.

The outstanding geographic location, a wide range of supporting infrastructure and a deep-water port serve as a major attraction for foreign capital. Utilized foreign investment reached US$10.344 billion in 2008. Among the top 500 enterprises worldwide, 19 of them have investment projects in Zhuhai such as ExxonMobil, BP, Siemens, Carrefour and Matsushita.

=== Manufacturing industries ===
Industrial development in Zhuhai focuses on five new high-tech and heavy industries including electronics, computer software, biotechnology and pharmacy, machinery and equipment as well as petrochemical industries. Aiming to strengthen the existing industrial base as well as to provide a better environment for the development of new high-tech industries, the local government has taken the initiative in developing five economic zones:

==== Zhuhai High-Tech Industrial Development Zone ====
As one of the four earliest Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in China, Zhuhai SEZ was set up in the year 1980 and granted with a local legislative right. Zhuhai hi-tech zone is located in the north of Zhuhai, which is very close to downtown. Furthermore, technological resources are centralised in our zone; there is also a huge development in hi-tech industries led by the software and IC industries. The hi-tech zone is the showcase for Zhuhai&#x27;s scientific development. Meizu is one high tech product headquartered in Zhuhai.

==== Zhuhai Free Trade Zone ====
Zhuhai Free Trade Zone (Zhuhai FTZ) was founded in 1996 with the State Council&#x27;s approval, occupying . A Zhuhai FTZ Administrative Committee was set up in June 1997. By the end of 2006 there had been over 200 companies registered in the Free Trade Zone, including more than 150 foreign-funded enterprises, and the total investment amount was one billion US dollars. Industries encouraged in the zone include electronics assembly and manufacturing, telecommunications equipment, building/construction materials, instruments and industrial equipment production, medical equipment and supplies, raw material processing, research and development, shipping/warehousing/logistics, and heavy industry.

==== Wanshan ocean development testing zone ====
The Wanshan archipelago is located in one of the major fishing areas of China and is core to the Wanshan ocean development testing zone. However, &quot;Perna viridis&quot;, a species of green mussel, was found to be contaminated by HCHs, DDTs, and PCBs.

==== Hengqin economic development zone ====
In April 2023 the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has published for the Hengqin economic development zone a list of industries that are illegible for investment policies, including income tax benefits for workers. The stated aim of the investment policy is to integrate Macao with key industries in the Pearl River Delta.

==== Global printer consumables manufacturing centre ====
Zhuhai manufactured and supplied 70 per cent of the world&#x27;s ribbons, 60 per cent of the world&#x27;s aftermarket inkjet cartridges and 20 per cent of the world&#x27;s third-party laser toner cartridges. Their combined sales were worth more than 1.3 billion US dollars or 10 per cent of all the sales in the world. Zhuhai owns a comprehensive supply chain and almost any of the raw materials needed by the printer consumables industry can be provided locally.

== Administration ==

The prefecture-level city of Zhuhai administers three county-level divisions and four special economic districts, all of which are districts.

== Transportation ==


=== Airports ===
* Zhuhai Jinwan Airport , formerly Zhuhai Sanzao Airport, an international airport connecting all provincial capital cities in Mainland China (except Xining and Lhasa) and many other major cities, hosting an annual air show and an exhibition hall, with Chinese space rockets located in Jinwan District.
* (), verbally &quot;Jiuzhou Heliport ()&quot;) , is located in Xiangzhou district, near the Jiuzhou harbour, and has short plane runway and a helipad. Its place inside Jiuzhou inner district, permits quick transport of injured people from surrounding islands to the city hospitals. China Southern Airlines offer sightseeing flights and charters to drilling stations in South China Sea using Sikorsky S-76 helicopters via this airport as well. They used to fly to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport from this airport using Cessna C208 Caravan as well, but the route was discontinued.
Zhuhai also is served by airports outside:
* Macau International Airport , which is closer to the city of Zhuhai proper, than Zhuhai Jinwan Airport itself, has an &quot;Express Link&quot; service in which transiting passengers who go through Gongbei Port of Entry/Posto Fronteiriço das Portas do Cerco are not processed through Macau customs; passengers may also have their baggage taken from Macau Airport to Lotus Bridge in Hengqin Island.
* Hong Kong International Airport ; ticketed passengers can take ferries from the Zhuhai Ferry Terminal to the HKIA Skypier. Since its inauguration in September 2018, Zhuhai residents can reach HKG via Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge.

Zhuhai residents may also use Shenzhen Bao&#x27;an International Airport and travel there by bus or ferry.

=== Railway ===
Zhuhai Railway Station is located at the western end of Gongbei Port of Entry and Portas do Cerco at the border of Zhuhai and Macau. There are frequent high speed trains to Guangzhou, Guilin, Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and other main cities in China. The intercity railway between Zhuhai Gongbei and Zhuhai Jinwan International Airport is under construction. It is expected to be opened to Hengqin in November 2019, and the whole project will be completed in 2024. It will take only 30 minutes to commute from urban district to the airport using the completed line.

Zhuhai also has a tram network, with the first phase of Line 1 completed in 2014. In 2017, Line 1 began service to the public. The trams ceased running in January 2021 due to frequent power issues and low patronage.

=== Sea ===
Zhuhai is known for its good climate and good air quality. Endowed with a long coastline, it is the only city on the western Pearl River Delta with natural deep-water ports.

Zhuhai has two international seaports: Jiuzhou () and Gaolan (). Gaolan Port is one of the leading ports in Guangdong province, while Jiuzhou Port focuses on heavy passenger sea transport.

Chu Kong Passenger Transport operates a ferry service between Zhuhai&#x27;s Jiuzhou Port, Hong Kong and Shekou Passenger Terminal, in the Nanshan District of Shenzhen. A service between Jiuzhou Port and Hong Kong International Airport for air passengers using the airport began on 10 July 2007.

=== Road ===
Zhuhai is currently served by two major Chinese national expressways:
 G94 Pearl River Delta Ring Expressway

* The G94 Pearl River Delta Ring Expressway, which will form a beltway surrounding the Guangzhou metropolitan area when completed, currently connects Zhuhai to the Sanshui District of Foshan. In 2018 the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge opened, reducing the travel time by road from Zhuhai to Hong Kong in approximately 40 minutes. G94 was extended to follow this bridge, with sections currently under construction connecting the bridge to the Zhuhai-Foshan section.

 G0425 Guangzhou–Macau Expressway
* A spur route of the mainline G4 Beijing–Hong Kong and Macau Expressway, G0425 directly links Guangzhou to Zhuhai (and thus, Macau). It has a concurrency with G94 for several kilometres. Heavy traffic between Zhuhai and Macau has led to the construction of a new cross-border corridor, the Lotus Bridge, built in November 1999 to divert traffic away from the congested Gongbei Port of Entry (Portas do Cerco). G0425 currently ends in Zhuhai at Zhuhai Avenue, pending an extension to the Lotus Bridge via Hengqin island.

== Tourism ==

Zhuhai and the surrounding landscapes were developed into an industrial output zone in the 1980s. Prior to that, Zhuhai generated economic development on the basis of tourism, benefiting from the comfortable subtropical climate. Zhuhai enjoys the reputation of a coastal garden city. When environmental pollution from the manufacturing industries threatened the quality of life, Zhuhai introduced strict environmental laws and hired engineers from Singapore to assist the city with urban planning.
Realizing the benefits brought by tourism, the local government is expanding tourist destinations and is developing new spots such as Hengqin (), Dong&#x27;ao (), Hebao (), Qi&#x27;ao () and Yeli ().

== Exhibitions and conferences ==
Zhuhai hosts the China International Aviation &amp; Aerospace Exhibition biannually in November. It is the largest Air Show in China and a huge tourist attraction.

=== New Yuan Ming Palace ===
The New Yuan Ming Palace () is a park of , including an lake. It features a partial reconstruction of the Old Summer Palace in Beijing which was destroyed during the Second Opium War and was never rebuilt on its original site.


=== Coast of Xianglu Bay—Fisher Girl Statue ===
The coast of Xianglu Bay is considered the &quot;symbol&quot; of Zhuhai, offering a scenic view of Pearl River Delta with silt-rich water, rocks, and a beach. The famous landmark of the city, &quot;Zhuhai Fisher Girl&quot;, stands elegantly on a boulder in Xianglu Bay; the statue is draped by a fishnet and holds a pearl high in the air with both hands up to the sky, symbolising a vigorous and lively Zhuhai welcoming visitors from all over the world. It was erected in 1982 by Pan He, a professor from the Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts, and is tall and composed of 70 pieces of granite. Visitors can view the statue up close from a boardwalk on the shore. The statue was based on a local legend, in which the daughter of the celestial Dragon King visited the Pearl River delta, became a fisherwoman, and married a mortal.

ZIC has held the BPR Global GT Endurance Series in 1996, the FIA GT Championship in 1997, 1999, 2004 and 2005. It hosted the championship&#x27;s 2007 opening round on 24 and 25 March. ZIC had planned to host a round of the Champ Car World Series on 20 May 2007, but agreement was not reached. ZIC held an A1GP race in 2007 for the first time in series&#x27; history. ZIC became the first venue in China to host the Intercontinental Le Mans Cup on 7 November 2010 when the 2010 1000 km of Zhuhai was staged.

Zhuhai has also a new tennis center which hosts WTA Elite Trophy, the last tournament of the year for players that are in the top 20 but did not qualify to WTA Finals.

<text>The Allgemeine Encyclopädie der Wissenschaften und Künste (&quot;Universal Encyclopaedia of Sciences and Arts&quot;) was a 19th-century German encyclopaedia published by Johann Samuel Ersch and Johann Gottfried Gruber, therefore also known as the &quot;Ersch-Gruber.&quot; One of the most ambitious encyclopaedia projects ever, it remains uncompleted.

It was designed and begun in 1813 by Professor Ersch to satisfy the wants of Germans, only in part supplied by foreign works. It was stopped by the Napoleonic Wars until 1816, when Professor Gottlieb Hufeland joined, but he died on November 25, 1817, while the specimen part was at press. The first volume appeared in Leipzig in 1818. The editors of the different sections at various times were some of the best-known men of learning in Germany, including Gruber, M.H.E. Meier, Hermann Brockhaus, W. Müller and A.G. Hoffmann of Jena. Naturalist Eduard Poeppig wrote most of the articles on the Americas. All articles bear the authors&#x27; names, and those not ready in time were placed at the end of their letter.

The work is divided into three sections: 
# A-G (99 volumes published, complete) : 
# H-N (only the first 43 volumes published, through &quot;Ligatur&quot;)
# O-Z (only the first 25 volumes published, through &quot;Phyxios&quot;)

From its beginning through 1830, the &quot;Encyclopädie&quot; was published at Leipzig by Johan Friedrich Gleditsch. From 1831 until publication ceased in 1889, the &quot;Encyclopädie&quot; was published by Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus, also of Leipzig. Gleditsch published volumes 1 through 21 of the first section; volumes 1 through 7 of the second, but only the first volume of the third section. Brockhaus published the remaining volumes through 1889. By 1889, when the project was abandoned, the &quot;Encyclopädie&quot; had reached 167 volumes. The article about Greece alone covered 3,668 pages, spanning eight volumes.

<text>Saimaa ( , ; ) is a lake located in the Finnish Lakeland area in southeastern Finland. With a surface area of approximately , it is the largest lake in Finland, and the fourth-largest natural freshwater lake in Europe. 

The name Saimaa likely comes from a non-Uralic, non-Indo European substrate language. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the name may be connected to the Sami word &quot;sápmi&quot;.

==History==

The lake was formed by glacial melting at the end of the Ice Age. Major towns on the lakeshore include Lappeenranta, Imatra, Savonlinna, Mikkeli, Varkaus, and Joensuu. About 6,000 years ago, ancient Lake Saimaa, estimated to cover nearly at the time, was abruptly discharged through a new outlet. The event created thousands of square kilometres of new residual wetlands. Following this event, the region saw a population maximum in the decades following only to later return to an ecological development towards old boreal conifer forests which saw a decline in population.

==Topography==
The Vuoksi River flows from Saimaa to Lake Ladoga. Most of the lake is dotted with islands, and narrow canals divide the lake in many parts, each having its own name (major basins include Orivesi, Puruvesi, Haukivesi, Yövesi, Pihlajavesi, and Pyhäselkä, among others). The southernmost major basin is sometimes called &quot;Suur-Saimaa&quot;, or &quot;Greater Saimaa&quot;, but this is not an official name.

Saimaa exhibits all major types of lake in Finland at different levels of eutrophication.

Finland&#x27;s Ministry for Foreign Affairs describes the Saimaa basin (an area larger than the lake) as a &quot;maze of detail&quot;: according to an English-language statement, the area includes 14,000 islands and &quot;more shoreline here per unit of area than anywhere else in the world, the total length being nearly .&quot;
==Natural resources==
An endangered freshwater seal, the Saimaa ringed seal, lives only at Saimaa. Another of the lake&#x27;s endangered species is the Saimaa salmon.

Due to its rich, easily accessible asbestos deposits, the shores of the lake are the most probable origin of asbestos-ceramic, a type of pottery made between c. 1900 BC – 200 AD.

The areas around Saimaa lake are a very popular location for summer cabins as well as lake cruises.

==Saimaa canal==

The Saimaa Canal from Lauritsala (Lappeenranta) to Vyborg connects Saimaa to the Gulf of Finland. Other canals connect Saimaa to smaller lakes in Eastern Finland and form a network of waterways. These waterways are mainly used to transport wood, minerals, metals, pulp and other cargo, though tourists also use the waterways.

==Notable people==
* The Russian writer Maxim Gorky went into exile near the shores of Lake Saimaa for a period of time after his apartment was raided by the Black Hundreds in the aftermath of the Moscow Uprising of 1905. He wrote to his divorced wife Ekaterina, writing &quot;it&#x27;s beautiful here, like a fairy tale&quot;.

<doc id="268039" wikidata="Q207388" url="?curid=268039" title="Muntenia">
<text>Muntenia (, also known in English as Greater Wallachia) is a historical region of Romania, part of Wallachia (also, sometimes considered Wallachia proper, as &quot;Muntenia&quot;, &quot;Țara Românească&quot;, and the rarely used &quot;Valahia&quot; are synonyms in Romanian). It is situated between the Danube (south and east), the Carpathian Mountains (the Transylvanian Alps branch) and Moldavia (both north), and the Olt River to the west. The latter river is the border between Muntenia and Oltenia (or &quot;Lesser Wallachia&quot;). Part of the traditional border between Wallachia/Muntenia and Moldavia was formed by the rivers Milcov and Siret.

==Geography==
Muntenia includes București - Ilfov, Sud - Muntenia, and part of the Sud-Est development regions. It consists of nine counties entirely:
* Brăila
* Buzău
* Călărași
* Argeș
* Dâmbovița
* Giurgiu
* Ialomița
* Ilfov
* Prahova

And parts of four others:
* Teleorman (the entire county with the exception of Islaz)
* Vrancea (southern part)
* Vâlcea (eastern part)
* Olt (eastern part)

Romania&#x27;s capital city, Bucharest, is situated in Muntenia. Other important cities are: 
* Brăila
* Buzău
* Pitești
* Ploiești
* Târgoviște
