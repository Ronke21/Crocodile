<text>The Kola Peninsula (; ) is a peninsula located mostly in northwest Russia and partly in Finland and Norway. It is one of the largest peninsulas of Europe. Constituting the bulk of the territory of Murmansk Oblast, it lies almost completely inside the Arctic Circle and is bordered by the Barents Sea to the north and by the White Sea to the east and southeast. The city of Murmansk, the most populous settlement on the peninsula, has a population of roughly 270,000 residents.

While humans had already settled in the north of the peninsula in the 7th–5th millennium BC, the rest of its territory remained uninhabited until the 3rd millennium BC, when various peoples started to arrive from the south. By the 1st millennium CE only the Sami people remained. This changed in the 12th century, when Russian Pomors discovered the peninsula&#x27;s rich resources of game and fish. Soon after, the Pomors were followed by the tribute collectors from the Novgorod Republic, and the peninsula gradually became a part of the Novgorodian lands. The Novgorodians, however, established no permanent settlements until the 15th century.

The Soviet period (1917–1991) saw a rapid population increase, although most of the new arrivals remained confined to urbanized territories along the sea coast and the railroads. The Sami people were subject to forced collectivization, including forced relocation to Lovozero and other centralized settlements, and overall the peninsula became heavily industrialized and militarized, largely due to its strategic position (as the pre-eminent Soviet ice-free Atlantic coast) and to the discovery of the vast apatite deposits in the 1920s. As a result, the peninsula suffered major ecological damage. After the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, the economy went into decline. Its population fell from 1,150,000 in 1989 to 795,000 in 2010. The peninsula recovered somewhat in the early 21st century, and is considered the most industrially developed and urbanized region in northern Russia.

Despite the peninsula&#x27;s northerly location, its proximity to the North Atlantic Current (an extension of the Gulf Stream) leads to unusually high temperatures in winter, but also results in high winds due to the temperature variations between land and the Barents Sea. Summers are rather chilly, with the average July temperature of only . The peninsula is covered by taiga in the south and by tundra in the north, where permafrost limits the growth of trees, resulting in landscape dominated by shrubs and grasses. The peninsula supports a small variety of mammals, and its rivers are an important habitat for the Atlantic salmon. The Kandalaksha Nature Reserve, established to protect the population of common eider, is located in the Kandalaksha Gulf. The peninsula is also the site of the Kola Superdeep Borehole, the deepest hole drilled into the Earth.

==Geography==
===Location and overview===
The peninsula is located in the far northwest of Russia, almost completely inside the Arctic Circle and is bordered by the Barents Sea in the north and the White Sea in the east and southeast. Geologically, the peninsula occupies the northeastern edge of the Baltic Shield. The western border of the peninsula stretches along the meridian from the Kola Bay through the valley of the Kola River, Lake Imandra, and the Niva River to the Kandalaksha Gulf, although some sources push it all the way west to Russia&#x27;s border with Finland.

Under a more restrictive definition, the peninsula covers an area of about . The northern coast is steep and high, while the southern coast is flat. The western part of the peninsula is covered by two mountain ranges: the Khibiny Mountains and the Lovozero Massif; the former contains the highest point of the peninsula—Yudychvumchorr. Mount Chasnachorr, the height of which is , had been formerly considered the highest point of the Khibiny. The Keyvy drainage divide lies in the central part. The mountainous reliefs of the Murman and Kandalaksha Coasts stretch from southeast to northwest, mirroring the peninsula&#x27;s main orographic features.

Administratively, the territory of the peninsula consists of Lovozersky and Tersky Districts, parts of Kandalakshsky and Kolsky Districts, as well as the territories subordinated to the cities and towns of Murmansk, Ostrovnoy, Severomorsk, Kirovsk, and parts of the territories subordinated to Apatity, Olenegorsk, and Polyarnye Zori.

===Natural resources===
Because the last ice age removed the top sediment layer of the soil, the surface of Kola Peninsula is extremely rich in various ores and minerals, including apatites and nephelines; copper, nickel, and iron ores; mica; kyanites; ceramic materials, as well as rare-earth elements and non-ferrous ores. Deposits of construction materials such as granite, quartzite, and limestone are also abundant. Diatomaceous earth deposits are common near lakes and are used to produce insulation.

===Climate===
Proximity of the peninsula to the Gulf Stream leads to unusually high temperatures in winter for the region, resulting in significant temperature variations between land and the Barents Sea and in fluctuating temperatures during high winds. Cyclones are typical during the cold seasons, while the warm seasons are characterized by anticyclones. Monsoon winds are common in most areas, with south and southwesterly winds prevailing in winter months and with somewhat more pronounced easterly winds in summer. Strong storm winds blow for 80–120 days a year. The waters of the Murman Coast remain warm enough to remain ice-free even in winter.

Precipitation levels on the peninsula are rather high: in the mountains, on the Murman Coast, and in other areas. The wettest months are August through October, while March and April are the driest.

The average temperature in January is about , with lower temperatures typical in the central parts of the peninsula. The average temperature in July is about . Record lows reach in the central parts and on the coasts. Record highs exceed almost on all the territory of the peninsula. First frosts occur as early as August and may last through May and even June.

Most areas of the Kola Peninsula are subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dfc&quot;). The nearby islands usually belong to tundra (Köppen climate classification: &quot;ET&quot;).

===Flora and fauna===

The peninsula is covered by taiga in the south and tundra in the north. In the tundra, cold and windy conditions and permafrost limit the growth of the trees, resulting in a landscape dominated by grasses, wildflowers, and shrubs such as dwarf birch and cloudberry. In northern coastal areas, stony and shrub lichens are common. The taiga in the southern areas is composed mostly of pine trees and spruces.

Reindeer herds visit the grasslands in summer. Other animals include red and Arctic foxes, wolverines, moose, otters, and lynx in the southern areas. American minks, which were released near the Olenitsa River in 1935–1936, are now common throughout the peninsula and are commercially hunted. Beavers, which became endangered by 1880, were re-introduced in 1934–1957. All in all, thirty-two species of mammals and up to two hundred bird species inhabit the peninsula.

Beluga whales are the only cetacean being common around the peninsula. Other dolphins, including Atlantic white-sided dolphins, white-beaked dolphins, and harbor porpoises, as well as large whales, such as bowhead, humpback, blue, and finback, also visit the area.

The coasts of the Kandalaksha Gulf and the Barents Sea are important breeding grounds for bearded seals and ringed seals. The Barents Sea is one of the only places the rare Gray seals can be found. Greenland seals, or harp seals, also can be seen from time to time.

Twenty-nine species of fresh water fish are recognized on the territory of peninsula, including trout, stickleback, northern pike, and European perch. The rivers are an important habitat for the Atlantic salmon, which return from Greenland and the Faroe Islands to spawn in fresh water. As a result of this, a recreational fishery has been developed, with a number of remote lodges and camps available to host sport-fishermen. The Kandalaksha Nature Reserve, established in 1932 to protect the population of common eider, is organized in thirteen clusters located in the Kandalaksha Gulf of the Kola Peninsula and along the coasts of the Barents Sea.

===Hydrology===

The Kola Peninsula has many small but fast-moving rivers with rapids. The most important of them are the Ponoy, the Varzuga, the Umba, the Teriberka, the Voronya, and the Yokanga. Most rivers originate from lakes and swamps and collect their waters from melting snow. The rivers become icebound during the winter, although the areas with strong rapids freeze later or not at all.

Major lakes include Imandra, Umbozero, and Lovozero. There are no lakes with an area smaller than . Recreational fishery is developed in the region.
===Ecology===
The Kola Peninsula as a whole suffered major ecological damage, mostly as a result of pollution from the military (particularly naval) production, industrial mining of apatite, and military nuclear waste. About 137 active and 140 decommissioned or idle naval nuclear reactors, produced by the Soviet military, remain on the peninsula. For thirty years, nuclear waste had been dumped into the sea by the Northern Fleet and Murmansk Shipping Company. There is also evidence of contamination from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, with contaminants being found in the flesh of reindeer and other animals, and from the 1972 and 1984 controlled nuclear explosions northwest of Kirovsk. Additionally, several nuclear weapons test ranges and radioactive waste storage facilities exist on the peninsula.

The main industrial pollution source is Norilsk Nickel in Monchegorsk—the large smelters responsible for over 80% of the sulfur dioxide emissions and for nearly all nickel and copper emissions. Since 1998, SO2 emissions in the area have dropped by almost 60%, from 88.3 thousand tonnes to 37.3 thousand tonnes in 2016, according to Norilsk Nickel. Based on its new ‘Sulphur programme 2.0&#x27;, Norilsk Nickel has set itself staged targets in cutting down sulphur dioxide emissions, which can have negative health and environmental effects. The ultimate aim is a 95% reduction (compared to 2015) in SO2 by 2030 for its Polar Division on the Taimyr peninsula, which includes its Nadezhda smelter and Copper plant, partly through a SO2 capture solution. Other polluters of note include the thermal power stations in Apatity and Murmansk.

==History==

===Early history===
The Rybachy Peninsula in the north of the Kola Peninsula was already settled in the 7th–5th millennium BCE. In the 3rd–2nd millennium BCE, the peninsula was settled by the peoples who arrived there from the south (the territory of modern Karelia). Bolshoy Oleny Island in the Kola Bay of the Barents Sea is the location of an important Bronze Age archaeological site where ancient DNA has been recovered.

By the end of the 1st millennium CE, the peninsula was settled only by the Sami people, who did not have their own state, lived in clans ruled by elders, and were engaged mostly in reindeer herding and fishing. In the 12th century, Russian Pomors from the shores of the Onega Bay and in the lower reaches of the Northern Dvina discovered the peninsula and its game and fish riches. The Pomors organized regular hunting and fishing visits and started barter trade with the Sami. They also called the White Sea coast of the peninsula Tersky Coast () or Terskaya Land ().

By the end of the 12th century, the Pomors explored all of the northern coast of the peninsula and reached Finnmark (an area in the north of Norway), necessitating the Norwegians to support a naval guard in that area. The name given by the Pomors to the northern coast was &quot;Murman&quot;—a distorted form of &quot;Norman&quot; meaning &quot;Norwegian&quot;.

===Novgorod Republic===
Pomors were soon followed by tribute collectors from the Novgorod Republic, and the Kola Peninsula gradually became a part of the Novgorodian lands. A 1265 treaty of Yaroslav Yaroslavich with Novgorod mentions Tre Volost (), which is later also mentioned in other documents dated as late as 1471. In addition to Tre, Novgorodian documents of the 13th–15th centuries also mention Kolo Volost, which bordered Tre approximately along the line between Kildin Island and Turiy Headland of the Turiy Peninsula. Kolo Volost lay to the west of that line, while Tre was situated to the east of it.

By the 13th century, a need to formalize the border between the Novgorod Republic and the Scandinavian countries became evident. The Novgorodians, along with the Karelians who came from the south, reached the coast of what now is Pechengsky District and the portion of the coast of Varangerfjord near the Jacob&#x27;s River, which now is a part of Norway. The Sami population was forced to pay tribute. The Norwegians were also attempting to take control of these lands, resulting in armed conflicts. In 1251, a conflict between the Karelians, Novgorodians and the servants of the king of Norway led to the establishment of a Novgorodian mission in Norway. Also in 1251, the first treaty with Norway was signed in Novgorod regarding the Sami lands and the system of tribute collections, making the Sami people pay tribute to both Novgorod and Norway. By the terms of the treaty, Novgorodians could collect tribute from the Sami as far as the Lyngen fjord in the west, while Norwegians could collect tribute on the territory of the whole Kola Peninsula except in the eastern part of Tersky Coast. No state borders were established by the 1251 treaty.

The treaty led to a short period of peace, but the armed conflicts resumed soon thereafter. Chronicles document attacks by the Novgorodians and the Karelians on Finnmark and northern Norway as early as 1271, and continuing well into the 14th century. The official border between the Novgorod lands and the lands of Sweden and Norway was established by the Treaty of Nöteborg on August 12, 1323. The treaty primarily focused on the Karelian Isthmus border and the border north of Lake Ladoga.

Another treaty dealing the matters of the northern borders was the Treaty of Novgorod signed with Norway in 1326, which ended the decades of the Norwegian-Novgorodian border skirmishes in Finnmark. Per the terms of this treaty, Norway relinquished all claims to the Kola Peninsula. The treaty did not address the situation with the Sami people paying tribute to both Norway and Novgorod, and the practice continued until 1602. While the 1326 treaty did not define the border in detail, it confirmed the 1323 border demarcation, which remained more or less unchanged for the next six hundred years, until 1920.

In the 15th century, Novgorodians started to establish permanent settlements on the peninsula. Umba and Varzuga, the first documented permanent settlements of the Novgorodians, date back to 1466. Over time, all coastal areas to the west of the Pyalitsa River had been settled, creating a territory where the population was mostly Novgorodian. Administratively, this territory was divided into Varzuzhskaya and Umbskaya Volosts, which were governed by a posadnik from the area of the Northern Dvina. The Novgorod Republic lost control of both of these &quot;volosts&quot; to the Grand Duchy of Moscow after the Battle of Shelon in 1471, and the republic itself ceased to exist in 1478 when Ivan III took the city of Novgorod. All Novgorod territories, including those on the Kola Peninsula, became a part of the Grand Duchy of Moscow.

The Novgorod Republic lost control of the peninsula to the Grand Duchy of Moscow in 1471, but the Russian migration did not stop. Several new settlements were established during the 16th century, and the Sami and Pomor people were forced into serfdom. In the second half of the 16th century, the peninsula became a subject of dispute between the Tsardom of Russia and the Kingdom of Denmark–Norway, which resulted in the strengthening of the Russian position. By the end of the 19th century, the indigenous Sami population had been mostly forced north by the Russians as well as by newly arriving Izhma Komi and Kominized Nenets (so-called Yaran people), who migrated here to escape a reindeer disease epidemic in their home lands in the southeast of the White Sea. The original administrative and economic center of the area was Kola, situated at the estuary of the Kola River into the Kola Bay. In 1916, Romanov-na-Murmane (now Murmansk) was founded and quickly became the largest city and port on the peninsula.

===Russian settlement===

Russian migration to the peninsula continued into the 16th century, when new settlements such as Kandalaksha and Porya-Guba were established. Kola was first mentioned in 1565. In the end of the 15th century, the Pomors and the Sami people were forced into serfdom, mostly by the monasteries. Monastery &quot;votchiny&quot; greatly expanded during the 17th century, but were abolished in 1764, when all of the Kola Peninsula peasants became state peasants.

In the second half of the 16th century, King Frederick II of Denmark–Norway demanded that the Tsardom of Russia cede the peninsula. Russia declined, and in order to organize adequate defenses established the position of a &quot;voyevoda&quot;. The &quot;voyevoda&quot; sat in Kola, which became the administrative center of the region. Prior to that, the administrative duties were performed by the tax collectors from Kandalaksha. Newly established Kolsky Uyezd covered most of the territory of the peninsula (with the exception of Varzuzhskaya and Umbskaya Volosts, which were a part of Dvinsky Uyezd), as well as the northern part of Karelia all the way to Lendery.

Despite the economic activity, permanent settlement of the peninsula did not intensify until the 1860s, and even then it remained sporadic until 1917. The population of Kola in 1880, for example, was only around 500 inhabitants living in 80 households, compared to 1,900 inhabitants in 300 households living there in 1582. Transportation facilities were virtually non-existent and communication with the rest of Russia was irregular. 1887 saw an influx of Izhma Komi and Nenets people who were migrating to the peninsula to escape a reindeer-disease epidemic in their homelands and brought their large deer herds with them, resulting in increased competition for the grazing lands, a conflict between the Komi and the Sami, and in marginalization of the local Sami population. By the end of the 19th century, the Sami population had mostly been forced north, with ethnic Russians settling in the south of the peninsula.

In 1894, the peninsula was visited by the Russian minister of finance, Sergei Witte, who became convinced of the region&#x27;s economic potential. Consequently, in 1896 telephone and a telegraph communications were extended to Kola, improving links with the mainland. The possibility of building a railway was also considered, but no action was taken at the time. Also in 1896, Alexandrovsk (now Polyarny) was founded, and grew in size so rapidly that it was granted town status in 1899; Kolsky Uyezd was renamed Alexandrovsky on that occasion.

During World War I (1914-1918), the still poorly developed peninsula suddenly found itself in a strategic position, as communication between Russia and the Allies via the Baltic and Black Sea was cut. Britain helped in the development of the ice-free harbors of the Murman Coast as the only practical means of sending Allied war supplies to the Eastern Front.
In March 1915, the construction of the railroad was rushed, and the railroad was quickly opened in 1916, even though it was only partially completed and poorly built. In 1916, Romanov-na-Murmane (Romanov on the Murman: modern Murmansk) was founded as the terminal point of the new railroad; the town quickly grew to become the largest one on the peninsula.

===Soviet and modern periods===
Soviet power was established on the territory of the peninsula on , 1917, but the territory was occupied by the forces of Russia&#x27;s pre-war allies in March 1918–March 1920. Alexandrovsky Uyezd was transformed into Murmansk Governorate by the Soviet government in June 1921. On August 1, 1927, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) issued two Resolutions: &quot;On the Establishment of Leningrad Oblast&quot; and &quot;On the Borders and Composition of the Okrugs of Leningrad Oblast&quot;, according to which Murmansk Governorate was transformed into Murmansk Okrug (which was divided into six districts) and included into Leningrad Oblast. This arrangement existed until May 28, 1938, when the okrug was separated from Leningrad Oblast, merged with Kandalakshsky District of the Karelian ASSR, and transformed into modern Murmansk Oblast.

All in all, the Soviet period saw a significant increase in population (from 15,000 in 1913 to 1,150,000 in 1989), although most of the population remained concentrated in the urban localities along the railroads and the sea coast. Most of the sparsely populated territories outside the urbanized areas were used for deer herding. This region is also home to the Kola Superdeep Borehole. In 1920–1940, the town of Kirovsk and several work settlements were established on the peninsula.

The Sami peoples were subject to forced collectivization, with more than half of their reindeer herds collectivized in 1928–1930. In addition, the traditional Sami herding practices were phased out in favor of the more economically profitable Komi approach, which emphasized permanent settlements over free herding. Since the Sami culture is strongly tied to the herding practices, this resulted in the Sami people gradually losing their language and traditional herding knowledge. Most Sami were forced to settle in the village of Lovozero, which became the cultural center of the Sami people in Russia. Those Sami resisting the collectivization were subject to forced labor or death. Various forms of repression against the Sami continued until Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953. In the 1990s, 40% of the Sami lived in urbanized areas, although some herd reindeer across much of the region.

The Sami were not the only people subject to repressions. Thousands of people were sent to Kola in the 1930s–1950s, and in 2007 over two thousand people—descendants of those forcibly sent there—still live on the peninsula. A significant portion of the people deported to Kola were peasants from southern Russia subjected to dekulakization. Prisoner labor was often used when building new factories and for manning those which were operational: in 1940, for example, the whole Severonikel Metallurgy Mining Complex was turned over to the NKVD system.

==Demography==

Until the 1800s, the Kola Peninsula was extremely sparsely populated, with only 5,200 inhabitants in 1858. In 1868 the Russian government created incentives for settlement and not only Russians but also Finns, Norwegians and Karelians moved to the peninsula. By the 1897 census 9,291 people were counted in the Kola uyezd; 63% Russian, 19% Sami, 11% Finnish and 3% Karelian.

By 1913 about 13,000–15,000 people lived in the peninsula, mostly along the shores. However, the discovery of the vast natural resource deposits and industrialization efforts led to an explosive population growth during the Soviet times. By 1970, the population of the peninsula was around 799,000. The trend reverted in the 1990s, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The population of the whole Murmansk Oblast went down from 1,150,000 in 1989 to 890,000 in 2002 to 795,000 in 2010.

As of the 2010 Census, the population consisted mostly of Russians (89.0%), Ukrainians (4.8%), and Belarusians (1.7%). Other groups of note include Komi (~1,600 inhabitants), Sami (~1,600), and Karelians (~1,400). The indigenous Sami people are mostly concentrated in Lovozersky District.

==Economy==
===Historical background===
During the 15th–16th centuries, the main occupations of the Tersky Coast population were Atlantic salmon fishing, seal hunting, and the extraction of salt from the sea water. The salt extraction in Kandalaksha and Kola was mostly carried out by the monasteries in Pechenga and Solovki, and for a long time remained the only &quot;industry&quot; on the peninsula.

By the mid-16th century, Atlantic cod fishing developed on the Murman Coast in the north. The 1560s saw a rapid growth of international trade, with the Russian merchants from different regions of the country arriving to the peninsula to trade with the merchants from Western Europe. In 1585 the trade was moved to Archangel, although the settlement of Kola was still permitted to trade locally produced goods.

During the 17th century, the salt extraction activities gradually went into decline as the locally produced salt was uncompetitive with cheap salt produced in the Kama River regions. Extensive poaching also led to the significantly reduced outputs from pearl hunting. Commercial deer herding became more popular, although its share in the economy remained negligible until the 19th century. By the end of the 17th century, the practice of seasonal fishing and hunting settlements in the north of the peninsula became very common.

Peter the Great, recognizing the political and economical importance of the peninsula, promoted its industries and commerce. The region fell into neglect after St. Petersburg was founded in 1703 and most of the shipping trade shifted there. In 1732, large deposits of silver in native form were discovered on Medvezhy Island in the Kandalaksha Gulf and copper, silver, and gold deposits were found in the lower reaches of the Ponoy River. Despite the efforts ongoing for the next two centuries, there was no commercial success. At the end of the 18th century, the local population learned the practice of peat production from the Norwegians and started using peat for heating. Timber cutting industry developed in the region at the end of the 19th century; mostly in Kovda and Umba.

The Soviet era saw drastic industrialization and militarization of the peninsula. In 1925–1926, significant deposits of apatite were discovered in the Khibiny Mountains, and the first apatite batch was shipped only a few years later, in 1929. In 1930, sulfide deposits were discovered in the Moncha area; in 1932–1933 iron ore deposits were found near the upper streams of the Iona River; in 1935, significant deposits of titanium ores were discovered in the area of modern Afrikanda.

The collectivization efforts in the 1930s led to the concentration of the reindeer herds in kolkhozes (collective farms), which in turn were further consolidated into a few large-scale state farms in the late 1950s–early 1970s. By the mid-1970s, the state farms were further consolidated into just two, based in Lovozero and Krasnoshchelye. The consolidations were rationalized by the necessity to isolate the herders from the military installations, as well as by the need to flood some territories to construct hydroelectric plants.

Fishing, being the traditional industry of the region, was always considered important although the volumes of production remained insignificant until the beginning of the 20th century. In the 1920s–1930s, the Murmansk Trawl Fleet was created and the fishing infrastructure started to develop intensively. By 1940, fishing accounted for 40% of the oblast&#x27;s and for 80% of Murmansk&#x27;s economy.

During the Cold War, the peninsula served as the naval basing area for a large portion of the Soviet naval and air strategic forces, providing protection from and posing a threat to northern Norway.
Also the ELF-transmitter ZEVS of the Russian Navy is situated there.

Border tensions between Norway and the Soviets were dramatized in the premiere of &quot;The Sandbaggers&quot;. Norwegian concerns about Russian troops in the Kola peninsula persisted into the 1990s, after the fall of the Iron Curtain.

===Modern economy===
After the economic slump of the 1990s, the economy of the oblast started to rebound during the first decade of the 2000s, although at a rate below the country&#x27;s average. Today the Kola Peninsula is the most industrially developed and urbanized region in northern Russia. The major port of the peninsula is Murmansk, which serves as the administrative center of Murmansk Oblast and does not freeze in winter. Although the strategic importance of the Kola Peninsula has diminished since the Cold War, the peninsula nevertheless still has the highest concentration of nuclear weapons, reactors, and facilities in Russia, with the number of nuclear reactors alone exceeding any other region of the world.

Mining is the basis of the oblast&#x27;s economy, and mining enterprises remain the principal employers in such monotowns as Apatity, Kirovsk, Zapolyarny, Nikel, and Monchegorsk. The Kola Mining and Metallurgical Company, a division of Norilsk Nickel, conducts nickel-, copper-, and platinum-group-metals-mining operations on the peninsula. Other large mining companies include OAO Apatit, which is the largest producer of phosphates in Europe; OAO Olcon, one of the leading producers of iron ore concentrates in Russia; and OAO Kovdorsky GOK, an ore-mining and processing enterprise.

The fishing industry, although still operating significantly below the Soviet level of production, remains profitable, supplying 20% of Russia&#x27;s fish in 2006 and with the volume steadily growing in 2007–2010. Murmansk is a key base for three fishing fleets, including Russia&#x27;s largest, the Murmansk Trawl Fleet. Fish breeding, especially of salmon and trout, is a growing industry.
The energy sector is represented by the Kola Nuclear Power Plant near Polyarnye Zori, which produces about half of all energy, and a network of seventeen hydroelectric and two thermal power stations, generating the other half. The energy surplus, accounting for about 20% of the total generated energy, is transferred to the unified energy system of Russia, as well as exported to Norway and Finland via the NORDEL system.

With the economy of the oblast being mostly export-oriented, transportation plays an important role and accounts for 11% of the Gross Regional Product. On the Kola Peninsula, the transportation network includes ship transport, air transport, automotive transport, electrified public transport, and access to the railways mostly passing through the rest of Murmansk Oblast. The city of Murmansk is an important port on the Northern Sea Route. The largest airports are the Murmansk Airport, which handles international flights to Scandinavian countries, and the joint military-civilian Kirovsk-Apatity Airport located southeast of Apatity.

<text>Utah State University (USU or Utah State) is a public land-grant research university with its main campus in Logan, Utah, United States. Founded in 1888 under the Morrill Land-Grant Acts as Utah&#x27;s federal land-grant institution, Utah State serves as one of Utah&#x27;s two flagship universities. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. The Logan campus is the state&#x27;s largest public residential campus, with more than 84% of students living away from home.

As of fall 2023, Utah State had 28,063 enrolled students, including 20,259 at its main Logan campus. The university has a presence statewide, with a total of 30 statewide campuses and more than 50 research institutes and centers. Among these research institutes is the Space Dynamics Laboratory (SDL), which is the sole University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) for the Missile Defense Agency, and a UARC for the United States Department of Defense.

According to the National Science Foundation, Utah State was ranked 83rd nationally and 54th among public universities for total research and development revenue and expenditures, with $344.9 million in 2022. The university also hosts the second-oldest undergraduate research program in the United States.

Utah State&#x27;s athletic teams, known as the Utah State Aggies, compete in NCAA Division I as members of the Mountain West Conference. Beginning July 1, 2026, the Aggies will compete in the Pac-12 Conference.

== History==

=== Background and founding===
On December 16, 1861, Representative Justin Morrill (VT) introduced a bill into the U.S. House of Representatives &quot;to establish at least one college in each state upon a sure and perpetual foundation, accessible to all, but especially to the sons of toil...&quot; President Abraham Lincoln signed the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act into law in July 1862.

Meanwhile, after visiting a few rural agricultural schools in his native Denmark, Anthon H. Lund of the Utah Territorial Legislature decided that there existed in the Utah Territory a need for such a school fusing the highest in scientific and academic research with agriculture, the way of life for the vast majority of locals. Upon returning to the United States, Lund heard about the Morrill Act and pitched a vision for the college that would receive widespread support among members of the Territorial Legislature, seeking to reapply for statehood. Now, there came the question of location. According to historian Joel Ricks, &quot;Provo had received the Insane Asylum, Salt Lake City had the University and Capitol, and most of the legislature felt that the new institutions should be given to Weber and Cache Counties.&quot; Citizens in Logan, Cache County, banded together and successfully lobbied representatives for the honor. The bill to establish the Agricultural College of Utah was passed on March 8, 1888, and on September 2, 1890, 14-year-old Miss Vendla Berntson enrolled as its first student.

=== Consolidation controversies===

Utah State&#x27;s original charter focused on military science, technology, science, agriculture, and mechanical arts. In its early years, the college narrowly dodged two major campaigns to consolidate its operations with the University of Utah. Much controversy arose in response to President William J. Kerr&#x27;s expansion of the college&#x27;s scope beyond its agricultural roots. Detractors in Salt Lake City feared that such an expansion would come at the University of Utah&#x27;s expense and pushed consolidation as a counter.

In 1907, an agreement was struck to strictly limit the Agricultural College&#x27;s curricula to agriculture, domestic science, and mechanic arts. This meant closing all departments in Logan, including the music department, which did not fall under that umbrella. Consequently, the University of Utah became solely responsible, for a time, for courses in engineering, law, medicine, fine arts, and pedagogy, despite the Agricultural College&#x27;s initial charter in 1888, which mandated that it offer instruction in such things. The Utah State legislature lifted the bulk of the curricular restrictions during the next two decades, with all restrictions on Utah State&#x27;s academic growth being officially abolished in the 1990s.

=== Widespread growth===
The Agricultural College grew modestly amid the tumult, adding its statewide Extension program in 1914. A year later, it granted its first master&#x27;s degrees. UAC, as the Utah Agricultural College was commonly abbreviated, also received a boost in students due to World War I. Colleges and universities nationwide were temporarily transformed into training grounds for the short-lived Student Army Training Corps, composed of students who received military instruction and could return to their educations following their military service. As the then-tiny campus could not otherwise support such large numbers of new students, college president Elmer Peterson convinced the state in 1918 to appropriate funds for permanent brick buildings, which could be used as living space for SATC students during the war, and instruction afterward. After World War I, the Military Science program continued to grow. By 1947, Utah State&#x27;s military science program had earned recognition for its officer training efforts. During this time, the university commissioned many officers into the U.S. military, reportedly surpassed only by the United States Military Academy at West Point. This achievement has led to comparisons with other universities, including Oregon State University, which also refers to itself as the &quot;West Point of the West&quot; for its ROTC program&#x27;s officer commissioning during World War II. Both institutions contributed notably to U.S. military training in the mid-20th century.

The 1920s and 1930s saw the genesis of significant growth. Utah State added its School of Education in 1928, a prelude to the institution renamed Utah State Agricultural College in 1929. In 1957, the school was granted university status as Utah State University of Agriculture and Applied Science, but the short name Utah State University is used even in official documents.

At the beginning of World War II, Utah State was one of six colleges selected by the United States Navy to give a Primary School in the highly unusual Electronics Training Program (ETP). Starting March 23, 1942, and each month after, a new group of 100 Navy students arrived for three months of 14-hour days in concentrated electrical engineering study. Smart Gymnasium was converted to a dormitory, and Old Main was fitted for classrooms and laboratories. Larry S. Cole was named program director, and Waldo G. Hobson was the director of instruction. ETP admission required passing the Eddy Test, one of the most selective qualifying exams given during the war years. At a given time, some 300 Navy students were on the campus, augmenting the war years regular enrollment of 1,000. Sidney R. Stock had developed the Radio and Aviation Department earlier and entered the Navy as a Lieutenant Commander to assist in organizing electronics training. He was a member of the committee in Washington that planned the ETP and shortly returned to Utah State as the Officer-in-Charge. The ETP Primary School continued at Utah State until August 1944, graduating about 2,750 students in 30 classes.

During the late 1970s, controversy again erupted on campus surrounding the school&#x27;s historically sizeable Iranian population. As U.S. relations with Iran began to deteriorate throughout the decade, Iranian students on campus began staging protests against the Shah, which demonstrations met with some backlash in the community. Following the outbreak of the hostage crisis of 1979, immigration officials arrived on campus to interview each Iranian, an event that alienated many international and domestic students. For a time, the population of Middle Eastern students declined sharply and has only recently begun to rise again.

By the late 20th century, Utah State University aimed to expand its scope beyond being primarily recognized as a regional institution and sought to develop a broader national presence. Under the leadership of President George Emert, who served from 1992 to 2000, the university&#x27;s endowment grew from $7 million to $80 million.

=== 21st century===

Utah State forged collaborations with several foreign institutions and governments, especially under former president Stan Albrecht. The Merrill-Cazier Library opened in 2005, and other facilities have followed. In 2010, USU acquired both the Swaner Preserve and EcoCenter outside Park City and the former College of Eastern Utah, with its two campuses and various undergraduate and vocational programs. In 2012, the university successfully concluded a $400 million fundraising campaign, the largest ever at USU.

== System==
The Utah State University operates a system of campuses throughout Utah, with Utah State extension offices in all 29 of Utah&#x27;s counties.

Utah State also owns or manages operates within the following agricultural, equestrian, botanical, and ecological centers: the Bastian Agricultural Center (South Jordan), the USU Botanical Center (Kaysville), the Ogden Botanical Gardens (Ogden), Thanksgiving Point (Lehi), the Sam Skaggs Family Equine Education Center (Wellsville), and the Swaner Preserve and EcoCenter (Park City).

The earliest roots of USU&#x27;s distance education go back to 1904 when USU professors traveled by train from Logan to Burley, Idaho to deliver dairy lectures. In the 1950s, professors regularly drove around the state to teach courses and advise students. The first Statewide Campus, Uintah Basin, was designated by the Utah State Legislature in 1967. The following year, &quot;flying professors&quot; traveled weekly to teach at USU&#x27;s various campuses and centers. Traveling from the centers was necessary until Utah State installed satellite systems in 1996. In 2005, University President Stan Albrecht moved Utah State University&#x27;s Continuing Education unit to the Provost&#x27;s Office and established the USU Regional Campuses and Distance Education organization. The system grew in 2010 with the addition of USU Eastern to nearly one-half of USU&#x27;s enrollment. Today, the USU system includes USU Blanding, USU Eastern and 28 additional statewide campuses. In 2012, RCDE completed construction of the Regional Campuses Distance Education (RCDE) Building which houses broadcast classrooms, RCDE offices, and the Utah Education Network.

Utah State University has conducted studies and proposed long-term development master plans to the state of Utah, which have been approved in concept to create residential and research campuses at each of its additional campuses throughout the State.

=== Utah State University Eastern===

Located in Price, Utah, the former College of Eastern Utah joined the USU system in 2010 and became Utah State University College of Eastern Utah (USU Eastern). In 2013, the official name was shortened to Utah State University Eastern. USU Eastern operates a satellite campus, known as the Blanding campus, in Blanding, Utah. Before the acquisition, USU taught courses at the Blanding Education Center on the College of Eastern Utah Campus through Regional Campuses and Distance Education (RCDE). USU Eastern is a junior college and offers associate degrees, certificates, and vocational programs. Bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral courses, however, are available on-site through RCDE. USU Eastern competes as the Eastern Utah Golden Eagles and is the only campus besides Logan with an athletics program.

===Statewide campuses===
Regional Campuses and Distance Education (RCDE) work to fulfill USU&#x27;s land-grant mission to increase access to high-quality education throughout Utah.

Logan is one of many cities and towns hosting a statewide campus for the university.

== Logan campus==

===Logan Campus===

Utah State University&#x27;s main academic, research, residential, and innovation campus is located in Logan, Utah, spanning 600 acres at the mouth of Logan Canyon. The campus sits on a &quot;bench,&quot; a shelf-like foothill overlooking Cache Valley to the west, with Mount Logan and the Bear River Range rising sharply to the east.

The campus is home to more than 100 buildings. Key facilities include Maverik Stadium, the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum, Old Main (the university&#x27;s first building), the Merrill-Cazier Library (305,000 square feet), and the Manon Caine Russell-Kathryn Caine Wanlass Performance Hall.

The Logan City Cemetery divides much of the campus, with the main academic buildings to the south and the innovation and research facilities to the north. The campus also includes residential, recreational, and athletic buildings. To the west and north are located the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum and Merlin Olsen Field at Maverik Stadium.

USU owns over 1,000 acres in Cache County for future development and research, including agricultural centers, research farms, and the Innovation and Research Campus. Scientific and agricultural research facilities are located north and south of Cache Valley and throughout Utah.

=== Recreation and wellness facilities===

Students have full access to the HPER (pronounced &quot;hyper&quot;), Nelson Fieldhouse, and the 117,000-sq-ft ARC (Aggie Recreation Center) exercise facilities, which include basketball courts, indoor rock climbing, gymnastics equipment, two swimming pools, racquetball, squash, and outdoor field space for lacrosse, rugby, soccer, ultimate, and other sports.

===Arboretum and natural surroundings===

With more than 30 of Utah&#x27;s largest tree species and more than 7,000 trees, Utah State&#x27;s Logan campus has earned international recognition as an arboretum, accredited by ArbNet.

===Outdoor recreation and campus surroundings===

USU&#x27;s main campus in Logan, Utah, and the city of Logan have received several accolades, including being named the &quot;Best College Town&quot; for the 2019-2020 school year and &quot;Most Beautiful Campus in Utah.&quot; The campus benefits from its proximity to several outdoor recreational destinations and local amenities that offer students a wide variety of activities.

Directly adjacent to the campus are Logan Canyon and the Cache National Forest, which provide opportunities for hiking, camping, and skiing. Logan Canyon also serves as the main route to Beaver Mountain Ski Resort and Bear Lake, both of which are popular among students for winter sports and summer activities. Students often visit these nearby areas for recreational activities such as kayaking, paddleboarding, fishing, and skiing. The USU Outdoor Recreation Program supports these activities by renting equipment for camping, water sports, mountain sports, and winter sports, as well as providing trail maps and local expertise.

Several notable sites are situated near or within campus property. First Dam, a small research reservoir located at the mouth of Logan Canyon, is a popular spot for paddleboarding, kayaking, and fishing. The Logan Country Club, adjacent to the campus, is home to the university&#x27;s men&#x27;s golf team. Additionally, the Utah Water Research Laboratory is a key research facility near Logan Canyon.

In the broader region, students have access to other ski resorts, such as Powder Mountain and Cherry Peak Report, as well as local golf courses, lakes, and reservoirs, including Hyrum Reservoir at Hyrum State Park. Many students take advantage of Utah&#x27;s YETI ski pass, which allows limited access to all of Utah&#x27;s ski resorts. Weekend getaways to Yellowstone National Park, Teton National Park, and Lava Hot Springs are also popular due to their proximity to Logan.


== Student life==

=== Campus housing and dining===
Utah State University is Utah&#x27;s oldest and largest public residential campus. About 84% of Aggies live away from home.

Twenty-one widely varying on-campus buildings house single students, and 39 buildings on the north side of campus are available for married housing. Many more students live in the multitude of off-campus housing options nearby. Students on campus may dine in one of two cafeterias and the Forum Cafe at Merrill-Cazier Library, which offers paninis, soups, beverages, and more. There is also a full-service Skyroom restaurant and the Hub, which includes several dining options. On the east edge of campus sits Aggie Ice Cream, a popular local destination that has been producing ice cream, cheese products, sandwiches, and soups since 1888.

Starting in Old Main, USU has had a creamery since its founding in 1888. Students studying dairying and domestic arts applied to learn how to make both ice cream and cheeses. In 1921, Gustav Wilster began working with the College of Agriculture. By 1922, students studied dairy technology, fluid milk processing, ice cream manufacture, dairy engineering, cheese manufacture, butter making, dairy facility inspection, and dairy product judging. Wilster&#x27;s students would go on to create Casper&#x27;s Ice Cream, Farr&#x27;s Ice Cream, and Snelgrove&#x27;s Ice Cream. In 1975, the Nutrition and Food Sciences building was built, where Aggie Ice Cream is housed today, with a second location operating in USU&#x27;s Blue Square student housing, which opened in 2023.

Along with Aggie Ice Cream, USU owns and operates its chocolate factory, The Aggie Chocolate Factory, through the College of Agriculture and Applied Sciences. The Aggie Chocolate Factory has shops on both the academic and residential campuses in Logan and the athletic stadiums. During the winter, the Aggie Chocolate Factory will also sell its own-made hot cocoa; during hot days, they will sell &quot;Frozen As&quot;—a &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot; iced cocoa drink popular with students and fans.

=== Clubs, organizations, and Greek life===
USU students are also involved in more than 200 clubs, an active and influential student government, seven fraternities and three sororities, multiple intramural and club sports, and a student-run radio station.
=== Campus traditions and spirit===
Well-known student traditions include the rite of passage of becoming a True Aggie, which requires a student to kiss someone who is already a True Aggie on top of the Block &quot;A.&quot; Two students may also become True Aggies together on Homecoming night or A-Day. In 2011, USU broke the record in the Guinness Book of World Records for the most couples kissing at the same place at the same time. Nearby the Block &quot;A&quot; is the lighted &quot;A&quot; atop the Old Main tower, which shines white throughout the entire valley and blue on nights when a varsity sport has picked up a victory, or other special events have occurred on campus.

=== Student government and advocacy===
The Utah State University Student Association (USUSA) represents the university&#x27;s student body. USUSA is composed of 17 elected student officers and five appointed student officers. These officers typically oversee a particular area of responsibility that is outlined in each officer&#x27;s charter. The duties of USUSA officers can range from managing campus events and activities to promoting and advocating for particular initiatives at the Utah State Legislature. In February of each school year, students who wish to serve in the following year&#x27;s USUSA begin launching campaigns for office. Campaigns last one week and consist of a primary and general election in which the top two vote-getters from the primary advance to the general election, and the candidate who receives a majority vote in the general election is announced as the winner.

The USUSA received significant attention during the 2016–2017 school year when the organization declared a mental health crisis at Utah State University. The legislation (written by USUSA Student Body President Ashley Waddoups, USUSA Student Advocate Vice President Matthew Clewett, and USUSA Graduate Studies Senator Ty Aller) sought to raise awareness of significant wait times for students to utilize CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services) at Utah State as well as the increasing number of students who were suffering from mental health-related illnesses. After a successful lobbying campaign, the USUSA was able to influence the Utah State Legislature to pass a resolution declaring a mental health crisis at all Utah System of Higher Education (USHE) institutions. The resolution was subsequently signed by Utah Governor Gary Herbert in March 2017.

=== Service and volunteer programs===
In 1970, Utah State student Sue Brown and Director of Student Activities Val R. Christensen created one of the first service organizations in the nation. VOICE, Volunteer Organization for Involvement in the Community and Environment, worked to improve the environment and social issues in Cache Valley. VOICE became The Val R. Christensen Service Center in 1999 in honor of Dr. Christensen&#x27;s efforts and support of the organization. Today, students are involved in more than 20 service organizations including Aggie Special Olympics, Aggies for Africa, Alternative Breaks, and Senior University.

=== ROTC and military traditions===
Given USU&#x27;s history and traditions as a land-grant school with an original charter for, in part, military sciences, Utah State supports a robust ROTC program for the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, and Air Force. ROTC members wear uniforms or field attire as the color guard at home athletic events. Members of the ROTC are also present on the field and in the stadium at every home football game. Wearing field attire, members of the ROTC perform pushups and fire a 75mm howitzer cannon at the initial kickoff and each time after the Aggies score points. ROTC members also fire the cannon at the end of the game after every home team victory. Utah State ROTC cadet activity and presence both on and off the field is especially present at events surrounding Veteran&#x27;s Day and during athletic events when the Aggies compete against fellow Mountain West Conference rivals, the U.S. Air Force Academy Falcons. During certain home and away games, USU&#x27;s mascot, Big Blue, will also don military field attire. Utah State&#x27;s ROTC cadets also participate in other opportunities and events both on and off campus, including at the annual USU homecoming parade in Logan.

=== Big Blue and mascot culture===
USU&#x27;s Big Blue mascot is visible at home, away games, and in greater Logan and Utah communities. Nowadays, Big Blue is almost always seen as an athletic and acrobatic member and leader of the Spirit Squad in costume attire that performs dance moves and athletic stunts to the delight of USU fans. Historically, Big Blue was a real-life white rodeo-trained bull dusted in animal-safe and animal-friendly blue color chalk. However, when the new Spectrum was built, concerns over the real-life bull scuffing up the basketball court gave rise to the student version of the mascot becoming the more visible and public avatar of Big Blue. Big Blue will most always perform dance and acrobatic feats with the Spirit Squad and in the stadiums at home athletic events. At home football games, the student version of Big Blue leads the Aggie Football team onto the field between twin pillars of fire. At the same time, he rides a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Around Veteran&#x27;s Day. When the Aggies compete in athletic events against in-conference rivals, the Air Force Falcons and Big Blue will also wear military field attire during those games. Big Blue is seen somewhat as a local celebrity, especially in and around Logan, and the student version is often seen taking pictures and signing autographs with students, fans, and children in the community. It is considered an honor for a student to be named &quot;Big Blue,&quot; and tryouts are held for the honor. Once chosen as Big Blue, the student chosen cannot divulge to the student body or the public he is Big Blue until he officially steps down from that role in a formal, and often emotional, &quot;de-masking&quot; ceremony.

=== Music, chants, and celebrations===
Utah State has a history of various traditions, including its two fight songs (&#x27;Hail the Utah Aggies&#x27; and &#x27;The Scotsman&#x27;) and a range of chants, such as &#x27;I Believe.&#x27; The Scotsman is particularly notorious given its history and the unified standing body and hand motions made in unison by the student body and fans as part of the song. Other traditions and events for students are sponsored by USU, the HURD, and the Student Association and held throughout the year and include Homecoming and &quot;The Howl,&quot; the latter being the largest publicly-sponsored Halloween celebration in the state of Utah for USU students and their friends attending other schools. Other annual student events include the Luminary Processional, which welcomes new students each fall, and The End of Year Bash, a concert on campus that culminates at the end of the academic year each April.

== Colleges==

In 1903, USU was divided into six schools: The School of Agriculture, the School of Military Science, the School of Agricultural Engineering and Mechanical Arts, the School of Home Economics, the School of General Science, and the School of Commerce. In 1923, the university expanded to seven academic colleges: Agriculture, Home Economics, Military Science, Agricultural Engineering, Commerce and Business Administration, Mechanic Arts, and General Science. In 1924, the institution added a School of Education, and restructured the School of General Science to include a School of Basic Arts and Sciences.

Today, USU is organized into ten academic colleges:

The tenth college, the College of Veterinary Medicine, was announced in the spring of 2022 and is Utah&#x27;s first four-year veterinary school. Rather than continuing as a separate college, Utah State&#x27;s military science and ROTC programs (including the Center for Anticipatory Intelligence) are currently housed in the College of Humanities and Social Sciences while Utah State&#x27;s aviation, flight technology, and drone technology programs are currently housed in the College of Agriculture and Applied Sciences.

== Athletics==


Utah State University supports organized athletics within the varsity intercollegiate, club intercollegiate, and intramural categories. Since its founding in 1888, USU&#x27;s varsity and club sports and its players have won six individual national championships.

=== Varsity athletics===
USU has 16 formal varsity sports teams recognized through Aggie Athletics. They are known as the Utah State and are a part of the NCAA Division I Mountain West Conference (MWC), which they joined in the summer of 2013. The university&#x27;s varsity teams have won 37 conference championships including three national championships (i.e., once in Women&#x27;s Volleyball and twice in Softball). Golfer Jay Don Blake won the 1980 NCAA Championship and was named NCAA Player of the Year in 1981. Utah State University&#x27;s 90 All-American athletes have been named All-American 134 times. Utah State Aggies has 16 NCAA Division I teams, including:

The men&#x27;s basketball team plays in the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum, which has been named among the nation&#x27;s &quot;15 Toughest Places To Play In College Basketball.&quot; ESPN has also named USU&#x27;s student section, The HURD, among the smartest in the nation. During the 2008–09 season, USU&#x27;s ranking in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches&#x27; Poll rose as high as #17. USU basketball was 193–13 (.937) at home during the Stew Morrill era, having received 6 NCAA Tournament berths in between 2000 and 2010, and amassed more wins than any team in the nation except Duke, Kansas, and Gonzaga during that time. Utah State captured the Mountain West regular season title in 2018-19 and back-to-back tournament titles during the 2018–19 and 2019–20 seasons. Utah State&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball team has qualified for the NCAA Tournament in the three of the last five seasons, (2021, 2023, 2024).
USU&#x27;s football team is one of 133 schools in the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the United States. After years of challenges in football, USU improved under head coach Gary Andersen, completing the 2012 regular season with its first 10-win season, its first Western Athletic Conference championship in football, and rankings in all three major national polls.

In addition to Andersen&#x27;s hiring, the football program&#x27;s renaissance could be attributed in part to an emphasis, under Athletics Director Scott Barnes, on recruiting, TV coverage, fundraising, facilities upgrades, and internal reorganization, despite the athletics department&#x27;s dismal budget in comparison with other state and WAC schools. In recognition of these efforts, USU Athletics was crowned with the 2009 National Champion of the Excellence in Management Cup, which seeks to identify the university that wins the most championships with the lowest expenses Matt Wells was named head coach of USU&#x27;s football team before the 2013–2014 season. In December 2020, Utah State University vice president and director of athletics John Hartwell announced Blake Anderson as the Aggies&#x27; 29th head football coach.

<text>Al-Kabri () was a Palestinian Arab town in the Galilee located northeast of Acre. It was captured by the Haganah 21 May 1948, a week after the State of Israel was declared. In 1945, it had a population of 1,530 and a total area cultivated of 20,617 dunams. It is near the site of Tel Kabri.

==History==
===Crusader era===
In the 13th century, al-Kabri was known as &quot;Le Quiebre&quot; and belonged to the fief of Casal Imbert (az-Zeeb). In 1253, King Henry granted the whole estate of Casal Imbert, including Le Quiebre, to John of Ibelin. Shortly after, in 1256, John of Ibelin leased az-Zeeb and all its dependent villages, including Le Quiebre, to the Teutonic Order for ten years. In 1261, az-Zeeb, together with Le Fierge and Le Quiebre, were sold to the Teutonic Order, in return for an annual sum for as long as Acre was in Crusader hands. In 1283, it was still a part of the Crusader states, as it was mentioned under the name &quot;al-Kabrah&quot;, as part of their domain in the &quot;hudna&quot; (truce agreement) between the Crusaders based in Acre and the Mamluk sultan al-Mansur Qalawun.

===Mamluk period===
According to al-Maqrizi, it was under Mamluk rule by 1291, as it was mentioned under the name of &quot;al-Kabira&quot; in that year when Sultan al-Ashraf Khalil allocated the town&#x27;s income to a charitable organization in Cairo.

===Ottoman era===
Al-Kabri was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, and by the 1596 tax records it was part of &quot;nahiya&quot; (subdistrict) of Akka, part of Safad Sanjak with an all-Muslim population of ten households. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on various agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, cotton, beehives and/or goats and occasional revenues; a total of 1,691 akçe. 7/12 of the revenue went to a Waqf.

In Pierre Jacotin&#x27;s map from 1799 the village was called &quot;Kabli&quot;. The place was well known for its springs, including Ayn Mafshuh, Ayn Fawwar, Ayn al-&#x27;Asal, and Ayn Kabri. The number of springs made al-Kabri the main supplier of water in the District of Acre. Ancient aqueducts supplied water from the springs to Acre, and two additional canals were built by Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar in 1800, and Sulayman Pasha al-Adil in 1814.

In 1875, the French explorer Victor Guérin visited the village:

Many of the houses are built of good materials, which seem ancient. They are constructed of stones finely cut, mixed with simple rubble, perfectly jointed by means of little stones so placed as to fill up spaces and to make the whole compact. The site of an ancient church, now completely destroyed, is still, to a certain extent, to be traced. Many columns have been removed from it, and numbers of cut stones of medium size. Above the village, the ruins of houses prove that the place was once much more populous than now.

At twenty-five minutes walk from El Kabry is a spring called Neba Fawara. Formerly received in a basin, of which the foundations only are now visible, it runs away in a considerable stream, which waters several gardens. Enormous fig-trees show the extraordinary fruitfulness of the soil. A little farther I pass along arcades entirely covered with high bushes, which form part of the aqueduct of El Kabry. The ground rises here, so that the canal supported by these arcades is at the level of the ground, then it disappears altogether, reappearing again, according to the level of the ground. El Kabry is in a very advantageous position, thanks to its precious springs, which must always have caused the foundation of a group, more or less considerable, of houses. The name of Kabry shows that it was once called Gobara, a name given by Josephus to a place in another part of Galilee. It contains two abundant springs; one is received in a reservoir similar to that of Et Tell, and from there, by an opening made expressly, the water runs off in a cascade to turn mills and water gardens. The second spring gushes from the bottom of a kind of vaulted cave, into which one descends by steps, and it feeds the aqueduct, which, sometimes subterranean, sometimes on the level of the ground, sometimes borne in arcades, supplies Akka with water. Reconstructed by Jezzar Pasha at the end of the last century, this aqueduct has succeeded one much older, of which traces yet remain.
&lt;br&gt;
Besides these two springs there is a third not far off, called Ain Jatun, of equal importance, which fertilises the proverbially fruitful territory of Kabry.

In 1881 the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described the village as a &quot;village built of stone, containing about 400 Moslems, situated on the edge of the plain, with gardens and olives, figs and mulberries, apples and pomegranates; there is a large spring and birket here, at which the aqueduct conveying water to &#x27;Akka commences.&quot;

A population list from about 1887 showed &quot;el Kabry&quot; to have about 690 inhabitants, all Muslims.

===British Mandate period===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, al-Kabri had a population of 553 inhabitants, all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 728 Muslims in 173 houses. During this period, al-Kabri&#x27;s houses were built of stone, mud, and reinforced concrete. The village contained a mosque and a boys&#x27; elementary school. Agriculture was the base of the economy with villagers cultivating olives, citrus, and bananas and engaged in animal husbandry, including raising cattle.

The population grew to 1,530 in the 1945 statistics, still all Muslim. Together with the nearby Tarshiha, the villages had 47,428 dunums of land at this time. Of this, a total of 743 dunums of land in the two villages was used for citrus and bananas, 5,301 were plantation and irrigable land, 14,123 for cereals, while 252 dunams were built-up (urban) land.

===1948 war and destruction===

During the 1948 Palestine war, Al-Kabri was first badly shaken by the Palmach raid on the village on the night 31 January/1 February 1948, in which the house of the main al-Husayni-affiliated notable, Fares Efendi Sirhan, was partly demolished by a huge explosion. After this, Sirhan and his family fled to Lebanon.

On 27 March 1948, the Yehiam convoy bringing supplies to besieged Kibbutz Yehiam was ambushed while passing by al-Kabri and 46 Haganah members were killed.

In April 1948, the Haganah prepared an initial blueprint for an operation called &quot;Ehud&quot;, which provided for attacks on al-Kabri, al Nahar, al-Bassa and al-Zib for &quot;the destruction of the gangs [and] the menfolk, [and] the destruction of property&quot;. Yaacov Pundaq, a Haganah commander in the Carmeli Brigade&#x27;s 21st Battalion, who was responsible for the area around Nahariya designated to be part of the future Arab state in the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan, had repeatedly caused damage to the Kabri aqueduct nearby, the primary conduit for feeding Acre. In the face of successful repair work by Arabs, he contaminated the site&#x27;s waters with flasks of typhoid, or typhoid and diphtheria bacteria. This was the most serious use of Israel&#x27;s deployment of biological warfare in 1948.

The village was likely occupied on the night of 20–21 May during the second stage of Operation Ben-Ami, by which time most of the inhabitants had fled. During their dispersal in Galilee some of the villagers were killed when it was discovered that they came from al-Kabri, in retaliation for the convoy ambush.

According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, the remaining structures in al-Kabri&#x27;s lands in 1992 were &quot;crumbled walls and stone rubble, overgrown with thorns, weeds, and bushes.&quot;

A Jewish community by the same name, Kabri, was built on land adjacent to the site of the Palestinian village, which is also for agriculture and pasture land.

==Geography==
Al-Kabri was at the eastern end of the Western Galilee coastal plain. It was less than from the sea, with the Ga&#x27;aton River nearby to the south. The closest modern city is Nahariyya to the west. The villages lands were home to four springs: Ayn Mafshuh, Ayn Fawwar, Ayn al-&#x27;Asal, and Ayn Kabri.
 It is these springs that have brought people to the site since the Neolithic.

<doc id="267518" wikidata="Q1408065" url="?curid=267518" title="MESI protocol">
<text>The MESI protocol is an invalidate-based cache coherence protocol, and is one of the most common protocols that support write-back caches. It is also known as the Illinois protocol due to its development at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Write back caches can save considerable bandwidth generally wasted on a write through cache. There is always a dirty state present in write-back caches that indicates that the data in the cache is different from that in the main memory. The Illinois Protocol requires a cache-to-cache transfer on a miss if the block resides in another cache. This protocol reduces the number of main memory transactions with respect to the MSI protocol. This marks a significant improvement in performance.

== States ==
The letters in the acronym MESI represent four exclusive states that a cache line can be marked with (encoded using two additional bits):

;Modified (M): The cache line is present only in the current cache, and is &quot;dirty&quot; - it has been modified (M state) from the value in main memory. The cache is required to write the data back to the main memory at some time in the future, before permitting any other read of the (no longer valid) main memory state. The write-back changes the line to the Shared state(S).
;Exclusive (E): The cache line is present only in the current cache, but is &quot;clean&quot; - it matches main memory. It may be changed to the Shared state at any time, in response to a read request. Alternatively, it may be changed to the Modified state when writing to it.
;Shared (S): Indicates that this cache line may be stored in other caches of the machine and is &quot;clean&quot; - it matches the main memory. The line may be discarded (changed to the Invalid state) at any time.
;Invalid (I): Indicates that this cache line is invalid (unused).

For any given pair of caches, the permitted states of a given cache line are as follows:

When the block is marked M (modified) or E (exclusive), the copies of the block in other Caches are marked as I (Invalid).

== Operation ==

The MESI protocol is defined by a finite-state machine that transitions from one state to another based on 2 stimuli.

The first stimulus is the processor-specific Read and Write request. For example: A processor P1 has a Block X in its Cache, and there is a request from the processor to read or write from that block. 

The second stimulus is given through the bus connecting the processors. In particular, the &quot;Bus side requests&quot; come from other processors that don&#x27;t have the cache block or the updated data in their Cache. The bus requests are monitored with the help of Snoopers, which monitor all the bus transactions.

Following are the different types of Processor requests and Bus side requests:

Processor Requests to Cache include the following operations:
# PrRd: The processor requests to read a Cache block.
# PrWr: The processor requests to write a Cache block
Bus side requests are the following:
# BusRd: Snooped request that indicates there is a read request to a Cache block requested by another processor
# BusRdX: Snooped request that indicates there is a write request to a Cache block requested by another processor that doesn&#x27;t already have the block.
# BusUpgr: Snooped request that indicates that there is a write request to a Cache block requested by another processor that already has that cache block residing in its own cache. 
# Flush: Snooped request that indicates that an entire cache block is written back to the main memory by another processor. 
# FlushOpt: Snooped request that indicates that an entire cache block is posted on the bus in order to supply it to another processor (Cache to Cache transfers). 
(&quot;Such Cache to Cache transfers can reduce the read miss latency if the latency to bring the block from the main memory is more than from Cache to Cache transfers, which is generally the case in bus based systems.&quot;)

Snooping Operation: In a snooping system, all caches on a bus monitor all the transactions on that bus. Every cache has a copy of the sharing status of every block of physical memory it has stored. The state of the block is changed according to the State Diagram of the protocol used. (Refer image above for MESI state diagram). The bus has snoopers on both sides:
# Snooper towards the Processor/Cache side.
# The snooping function on the memory side is done by the Memory controller.

Explanation:

Each Cache block has its own 4 state finite-state machine (refer image 1.1). The State transitions and the responses at a particular state with respect to different inputs are shown in Table1.1 and Table 1.2

A write may only be performed freely if the cache line is in the Modified or Exclusive state. If it is in the Shared state, all other cached copies must be invalidated first. This is typically done by a broadcast operation known as &quot;Request For Ownership (RFO)&quot;.

A cache that holds a line in the Modified state must &quot;snoop&quot; (intercept) all attempted reads (from all the other caches in the system) of the corresponding main memory location and insert the data that it holds. This can be done by forcing the read to &quot;back off&quot; (i.e. retry later), then writing the data to main memory and changing the cache line to the Shared state. It can also be done by sending data from Modified cache to the cache performing the read. Note, snooping only required for read misses (protocol ensures that Modified cannot exist if any other cache can perform a read hit).

A cache that holds a line in the Shared state must listen for invalidate or request-for-ownership broadcasts from other caches, and discard the line (by moving it into Invalid state) on a match.

The Modified and Exclusive states are always precise: i.e. they match the true cache line ownership situation in the system. The Shared state may be imprecise: if another cache discards a Shared line, this cache may become the sole owner of that cache line, but it will not be promoted to Exclusive state. Other caches do not broadcast notices when they discard cache lines, and this cache could not use such notifications without maintaining a count of the number of shared copies.

In that sense the Exclusive state is an opportunistic optimization: If the CPU wants to modify a cache line in state S, a bus transaction is necessary to invalidate all other cached copies. State E enables modifying a cache line with no bus transaction.

Illustration of MESI protocol operations

For example, let us assume that the following stream of read/write references. All the references are to the same location and the digit refers to the processor issuing the reference.

The stream is : R1, W1, R3, W3, R1, R3, R2.

Initially it is assumed that all the caches are empty.

Note: &quot;The term snooping referred to below is a protocol for maintaining cache coherency in symmetric multiprocessing environments. All the caches on the bus monitor (snoop) the bus if they have a copy of the block of data that is requested on the bus.&quot;
* Step 1: As the cache is initially empty, so the main memory provides P1 with the block and it becomes exclusive state.
* Step 2: As the block is already present in the cache and in an exclusive state so it directly modifies that without any bus instruction. The block is now in a modified state.
* Step 3: In this step, a BusRd is posted on the bus and the snooper on P1 senses this. It then flushes the data and changes its state to shared. The block on P3 also changes its state to shared as it has received data from another cache. The data is also written back to the main memory.
* Step 4: Here a BusUpgr is posted on the bus and the snooper on P1 senses this and invalidates the block as it is going to be modified by another cache. P3 then changes its block state to modified.
* Step 5: As the current state is invalid, thus it will post a BusRd on the bus. The snooper at P3 will sense this and so will flush the data out. The state of both the blocks on P1 and P3 will become shared now. Notice that this is when even the main memory will be updated with the previously modified data.
* Step 6: There is a hit in the cache and it is in the shared state so no bus request is made here.
* Step 7: There is cache miss on P2 and a BusRd is posted. The snooper on P1 and P3 sense this and both will attempt a flush. Whichever gets access of the bus first will do that operation.

=== Read For Ownership ===
A &quot;Read For Ownership (RFO)&quot; is an operation in cache coherency protocols that combines a read and an invalidate broadcast. The operation is issued by a processor trying to write into a cache line that is in the shared (S) or invalid (I) states of the MESI protocol. The operation causes all other caches to set the state of such a line to I. A read for ownership transaction is a read operation with intent to write to that memory address. Therefore, this operation is exclusive. It brings data to the cache and invalidates all other processor caches that hold this memory line. This is termed &quot;BusRdX&quot; in tables above.

=== Memory Barriers ===
MESI in its naive, straightforward implementation exhibits two particular performance issues. First, when writing to an invalid cache line, there is a long delay while the line is fetched from other CPUs. Second, moving cache lines to the invalid state is time-consuming. To mitigate these delays, CPUs implement store buffers and invalidate queues.

==== Store Buffer ====
A store buffer is used when writing to an invalid cache line. As the write will proceed anyway, the CPU issues a read-invalid message (hence the cache line in question and all other CPUs&#x27; cache lines that store that memory address are invalidated) and then pushes the write into the store buffer, to be executed when the cache line finally arrives in the cache.

A direct consequence of the store buffer&#x27;s existence is that when a CPU commits a write, that write is not immediately written in the cache. Therefore, whenever a CPU needs to read a cache line, it first scans its own store buffer for the existence of the same line, as there is a possibility that the same line was written by the same CPU before but hasn&#x27;t yet been written in the cache (the preceding write is still waiting in the store buffer). Note that while a CPU can read its own previous writes in its store buffer, other CPUs &quot;cannot see those writes&quot; until they are flushed to the cache - a CPU cannot scan the store buffer of other CPUs.

==== Invalidate Queues ====

With regard to invalidation messages, CPUs implement invalidate queues, whereby incoming invalidate requests are instantly acknowledged but not immediately acted upon. Instead, invalidation messages simply enter an invalidation queue and their processing occurs as soon as possible (but not necessarily instantly). Consequently, a CPU can be oblivious to the fact that a cache line in its cache is actually invalid, as the invalidation queue contains invalidations that have been received but haven&#x27;t yet been applied. Note that, unlike the store buffer, the CPU can&#x27;t scan the invalidation queue, as that CPU and the invalidation queue are physically located on opposite sides of the cache.

As a result, memory barriers are required. A &quot;store barrier&quot; will flush the store buffer, ensuring all writes have been applied to that CPU&#x27;s cache. A &quot;read barrier&quot; will flush the invalidation queue, thus ensuring that all writes by other CPUs become visible to the flushing CPU. Furthermore, memory management units do not scan the store buffer, causing similar problems. This effect is visible even in single threaded processors.

== Advantages of MESI over MSI ==
The most striking difference between MESI and MSI is the extra &quot;exclusive&quot; state present in the MESI protocol. This extra state was added as it has many advantages. When a processor needs to read a block that none of the other processors have and then write to it, two bus transactions will take place in the case of MSI. First, a BusRd request is issued to read the block followed by a BusUpgr request before writing to the block. The BusRd request in this scenario is useless as none of the other caches have the same block, but there is no way for one cache to know about this. Thus, MESI protocol overcomes this limitation by adding an Exclusive state, which results in saving a bus request. This makes a huge difference when a sequential application is running. As only one processor works on a piece of data, all the accesses will be exclusive. MSI performs much worse in this case due to the extra bus messages. Even in the case of a highly parallel application with minimal sharing of data, MESI is far faster. 
Adding the Exclusive state also comes at no cost as 3 states and 4 states are both representable with 2 bits.

== Disadvantage of MESI ==
In case continuous read and write operations are performed by various caches on a particular block, the data has to be flushed to the bus every time. Thus, the main memory will pull this on every flush and remain in a clean state. But this is not a requirement and is just an additional overhead caused by using MESI. This challenge was overcome by the MOESI protocol.

In case of S (Shared State), multiple snoopers may response with FlushOpt with the same data (see the example above). The F state in MESIF addresses this redundancy.

<text>Kafr ʿInān (), is a former Palestinian village, depopulated in the 1948 Arab–Israeli war. It was located around east of Acre. 

In ancient times, it was known as Kfar Hananiah, and was a large Jewish village and a significant pottery production center. Archaeological surveys indicate Kefar Hanania was founded in the Early Roman period, and was inhabited through the Byzantine period. It was resettled in the Middle Ages and the modern era. By mid 1500, the village was wholly Muslim and was known as Kafr &#x27;Inan. 

Kafr ʿInān was captured by the Israel Defense Forces during the 1948 Arab–Israeli war. It was depopulated and destroyed as part of the 1948 Palestinian expulsion, with its residents expelled to the West Bank or to other Arab towns in the newly established Israel. Many villagers managed to &quot;infiltrate&quot; back to Kafr ʿInān, but on three separate occasions in January and February 1949 the Israeli army expelled them.

A shrine for the Sheikh Abu Hajar Azraq and the remains of a small domed building are still standing, along with the remains of various burial sites of rabbis. In 1989, the Israeli village of Kfar Hananya was established on Kafr ʿInān land on a hill adjacent to the former Palestinian village.

==History==
===Roman and Byzantine Kfar Hanania===
The earliest mentions of the village occur in sources from the Roman and Byzantine periods in Galilee, when it was then a Jewish village known as &quot;Kefar Hananya&quot; (or &quot;Kfar Hanania&quot;), that served as a center for pottery production in the Galilee. Most of the cooking ware in the Galilee between the 1st century BCE and the beginning of the 5th century CE was produced here. A Byzantine-period synagogue was partially carved out of the rock, probably during the 5th century CE, and its remains have been excavated east of the village. Khalidi mentions shafts and bases of columns, caves, a pool, and a burial ground discovered in archaeological excavations.

During the Second Temple period, within a distance of less than a kilometer from Kfar Hananya, was the thriving village of Bersabe (now &quot;Khirbet es-Saba&quot; [&quot;Kh. Abu esh-Shebaʿ&quot;], Beer Sheba of the Galilee), a village mentioned in the writings of Josephus.

Among the Kfar Hanania&#x27;s most respected personages who is said to have been buried there was a Tanna (Jewish sage) of the 1st century, Eliezer ben Jacob I. The Talmud and Midrash mention it as the home of Rabbi Jacob of Kfar Ḥanīn, a third-generation amora. As a result of Aramaic influence, the village became known as Kafr Ḥanan, a shortened form of Hananiah.

An Aramaic inscription dated to the 5th or 6th century was found on a &quot;kelilah&quot; (a polycandelon, i.e. a bronze chandelier holding glass lamps and suspended from the ceiling) in or near the Galilean village of Kefar Makr near Acre, reading &quot;This polycandelon [kelilah] … [offered] to the holy place [the synagogue] of Kefar Hananyah. May they be remembered for good. Amen, selah, shalom&quot;. The chandelier, now exhibited in a Belgian museum, bears the inscription next to the images of Judaic religious objects: two menorahs (seven-branched candlesticks), a lulav (palm frond) and a shofar (ram&#x27;s horn); for illustrations see here.

====Pottery production====
Rabbinic literature mentions Kfar Hanania village in relation to the production of pottery; in the Tosefta , there is a reference to, &quot;those who make black clay, such as Kefar Hananya and its neighbors.&quot; Late Roman-era pottery types of the kind made in Kafr &#x27;Inan have been found all throughout the Galilee and the Golan.

===Crusader to Mamluk period===
Ya&#x27;akov ben Netan&#x27;el, who visited the village in the 12th century during the period of Crusader rule, writes about the ruins of a synagogue quarried into the hill. Potential references to the village include a mention of the &quot;widow of Ben al-&#x27;Anani&quot; in a 12th-century Genizah document and to &quot;Kfar Hanan&quot; in the 13th century. In 1211, Samuel ben Samson travelled from Tiberias and Kfar Hanania before stopping in Safed. In the 14th century, another traveller transcribes the village&#x27;s name as &quot;Kefar Hanin&quot;.

===Ottoman period: Kafr ʿInan===
In 1522, Jewish traveler Moses ben Mordecai Bassola found about 30 families of Musta&#x27;arabi Jews (Arabic-speaking Jews, as opposed to Sephardi Jews) among the residents, most of whom of priestly stock, making it the fifth largest Jewish community in the country at the time, out of the eight places named by him. An Ottoman census taken two years later (1525) listed 14 Jewish families.

It is during the rule of the Ottoman Empire that the form Kafr ʿInān (Kafr &#x27;Anan) first appears. The village is listed in the tax records of either 1549 or 1596, as forming part of the &quot;nahiya&quot; (subdistrict) of &quot;Jira&quot;, part of Safad Sanjak, with 21 households and 8 bachelors; an estimated population of 259. All the villagers were Muslim. They paid taxes on goats, beehives and on its press, which was used either for olives or grapes; a total of 12,272 akçe. All of the revenue went to a Waqf. A map from Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of 1799 by Pierre Jacotin showed the place, named as &quot;K. Hanein&quot;.

It is said some Jewish Kohanitic families migrated to Peki&#x27;in, possibly in the late 16th century.

In 1881, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described the village as being built of stone and having 150-200 Muslim residents. The arable land in the village comprised gardens and olive trees.

A population list from about 1887 showed that Kafr &#x27;Inan had 80 inhabitants; all Muslim.

===British Mandate period===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, &quot;Kufr Enan&quot; had a population of 179; all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 264, still all Muslims, in a total of 47 houses.

In the 1945 statistics, Kafr &#x27;Inan had 360 Muslim inhabitants, with a total of of land according to an official land and population survey. Of this, a total of 1,740 dunums were used for the cultivation of cereals, 1,195 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards and most of these (1,145 dunums) were planted with olive trees, while 21 dunams were built-up (urban) area. The village, however, occupied an area of only 25 dunams (6.1 acres).

The village houses, made of stone with mud mortar, were bunched close together and separated by semi-circular, narrow alleys. Many new houses were constructed during the last years of Mandatory Palestine. Springs and domestic wells supplied drinking water. Olives and grain were the main crops. Grain was grown in the nearby flat zones and valleys.

===1948 Palestine war===
The village was captured on 30 October 1948 by the Golani Brigade as part of Operation Hiram and following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel. According to Walid Khalidi, the villagers refused to leave like most of the population in the area. Morris reports that the Israeli authorities classified the village as &quot;abandoned&quot; but the villagers kept returning. In January 1949, the IDF expelled 54, and moved another 128 inhabitants from Kafr &#x27;Inan and Farradiyya to other villages in Israel. On 4 February 1949, units of the 79th Battalion surrounded the two villages and expelled 45 people to the West Bank. The 200 villagers who had permits to stay, mostly old men, women and children, were transferred to Majd al Kurum. Yet again, the villagers returned. By mid-February 1949 there were about 100 back in the two villages, according to IDF sources. The two villages were again evacuated by the IDF.

The expulsion of the villagers upset some members of Mapam, who condemned David Ben-Gurion and the army. However, a suggestion for a Knesset motion calling for the establishment of an inquiry to probe the expulsions of the villagers of Kafr &#x27;Inan, Farradiyya and Al-Ghabisiyya, was apparently never brought to the Knesset plenum.

===Israel===
In 1950, Article 125 of the Defence regulation of 1945 was invoked in order to confiscate the land belonging to a number of Palestinian Arab villages in Galilee, among them Kafr &#x27;Inan. This law was also used to prevent the villagers from returning to their homes even by legal means.

The modern Jewish village of Kfar Hananya was first planned to the south of the depopulated Kafr ʿInān village in 1982, and was eventually established there in 1989 on village land (though not on the actual site of Kafr ʿInān). Chazon, built in 1969 on the lands of Al-Mansura, Tiberias, and Parod, built in 1949 on the lands of Al-Farradiyya (District of Safad), are both close to the village site, but not on village land. In 1992, Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi found piles of stones, clusters of cacti, fig trees, the remains of a domed building on a slope facing the village and the small shrine of Shaykh Abu Hajar Azraq on an adjacent hill to the east. The land around the site is forested and planted with fruit trees by the settlement of Parod.&quot;

==Archaeology==
===Roman to Byzantine-period village===
In 1933, Joseph Braslavsky was the first to identify the quarried synagogue in Kafr &#x27;Inan, based on the testimony of a local Arab peasant. In 1989, the site was surveyed by Zvi Ilan. Adan-Bayewitz, of the Martin (Szusz) Department of Land of Israel Studies and Archaeology at Bar Ilan University conducted archaeological research at the site from 1987 to 1988, and excavated a late Roman-era pottery kiln in 1992–1993, with a stone-paved approach.

<text>Kuwaykat (), also spelled Kuweikat, Kweikat or Kuwaikat, was a Palestinian village located 9 km northeast of Acre. It was depopulated in 1948.

==History==
The old &quot;khan&quot; (caravansary) in Kuwaykat possibly dated to the Crusader period or an earlier date. According to historian Denys Pringle, the &quot;khan&quot; might have been part of the headquarters of Genoese estate in the village built in the 13th century. It consisted of a round barrel-vaulted building made of ashlar.

In 1245 the western part of Kuwaykat was owned by the Church and Hospital of St Thomas the Martyr in Acre.

===Ottoman era===
In the late Ottoman period, Kuwaykat was named &quot;Chiouwe chiateh&quot; on the French map Pierre Jacotin made of the area during Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Egypt and Syria in 1799. In 1875 Victor Guérin visited, and found the village surrounded with gardens planted with fig and olive trees, and with an ancient well. He further noted that the village was mentioned in Crusader sources. In 1881 Kuwaykat was described by the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; as being built of stone and situated at the foot of hills. The roughly 300 Muslim residents cultivated olives. In 1887, an elementary school was built in the village. In addition, the village had a mosque and a shrine for the Druze religious leader, Shaykh Aby Muhammad al-Qurayshi.

A population list from about 1887 showed that &quot;Kiryet et Kuweikat&quot; had about 565 inhabitants; all Muslims. 

===British Mandate period===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, &quot;Kuaikat&quot; had a population of 604; all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 789, still all Muslims, in a total of 163 houses.

In April 1938, during the Arab revolt in Palestine, a group of Palestinian Arab rebels planted a mine on the road near Kuwaykat which blew up a British vehicle, killing nine soldiers (according to the Arabs) or one soldier and wounding two others (according to the British). A rebel leader in Kuwaykat, Fayyad Baytam, was approached by the regional rebel commander Shaykh Amhad al-Tuba, who ordered him to plant the explosive on the road. Baytam refused, arguing that planting the bomb would only inevitably bring retaliation upon the village. Two local rebels, Al-Tuba and Ali Hummada, planted the explosive instead. The British Army proceeded to start setting houses in Kafr Yasif ablaze in response, but were then informed by local residents that the inhabitants of Kuwaykat were responsible for the attack. The British troops fatally shot nine Arabs as they approached the village. 

In the 1945 statistics, Kuwaykat had 1,050 Muslim inhabitants, with a total of of land according to an official land and population survey. The land of Kuwaykat was considered to be among the most fertile of the district. Grain, olives and watermelons were its chief crops. In 1944/45 a total of 3,316 dunums were used for cereals, and 1,246 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards, of which 500 dunums were planted with olive trees, while 26 dunams were built-up (urban) area. The villagers also engaged in livestock breeding and dairy production. The village had a population of 1,050.

===1948 War and aftermath===
The first attack on the village of Kuwaykat during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War took place on 18–19 January 1948, and involved a force of over eighty Jewish militiamen, according to &quot;Filastin&quot;, the Palestinian newspaper at the time. The attack was repulsed, as was another attack on the village on the night of 6–7 February. The village was finally depopulated during a military assault by Israel&#x27;s Sheva&#x27; Brigade and Carmeli Brigade, as part of Operation Dekel. On the night of 9 July, at the start of the offensive, the village came under heavy bombardment. Villagers interviewed in 1973 in the refugee camp of Bourj el-Barajneh in Lebanon recalled: We were awakened by the loudest noise we had ever heard, shells exploding and artillery fire [..] women were screaming, children were crying...Most of the villagers began to flee with their pajamas on. The wife of Qassim Ahmad Sa´id fled carrying a pillow in her arms instead of her child ... Two people were killed and two wounded by the shelling. Many villagers fled to Abu Snan, Kafr Yasif and other villages that later surrendered. Those, mostly elderly, villagers who remained in Kuwaykat, were soon expelled to Kafr Yasif.

In January 1949, kibbutz ha-Bonim (later renamed Beit HaEmek) was established near the site of Kuwaykat, on village lands. Its settlers were Jewish immigrants from England, Hungary and the Netherlands. The Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi described the village in 1992: Little remains of the village except the deserted cemetery, completely overgrown with weeds, and rubble from houses. Inscriptions on two of the graves identify one as that of Hamad &#x27;Isa al-Hajj, and another as that of Shaykh Salih Iskandar, who died in 1940. The shrine of Shaykh Abu Muhammad al-Qurayshi still stands but its stone pedestal is badly cracked.

<text>Ivan Vladimirovitch Chtcheglov (Russian: Ива́н Влади́мирович Щегло́в; 16 January 1933 – 21 April 1998) was a French philosopher, political activist, and poet of Russian origin, best known as the ideologist of Unitary Urbanism and the author of the &quot;Formulary for a New Urbanism&quot;, published under the pseudonym Gilles Ivain in 1953.

==Biography==
===Family background===
Ivan was the son of Vladimir Chtcheglov, a revolutionary sentenced to two years imprisonment following the 1905 Revolution. After his release, Vladimir left the Russian Empire with his wife Hélene Zavadsky. After originally staying in Belgium for three years, the couple moved to Paris in 1910, where Vladimir continued work as a taxi driver. He was active in the CGT and involved in the 1911 drivers strike.

===Activities===
Ivan wrote &quot;Formulaire pour un urbanisme nouveau&quot; (Formulary for a New Urbanism) in 1953, at age nineteen under the name Gilles Ivain, which was an inspiration to the Lettrist International and Situationist International. The following quotation from the text was used as the inspiration for the famous Manchester nightclub, the Haçienda:

&quot;And you, forgotten, your memories ravaged by all the consternations of two hemispheres, stranded in the Red Cellars of Pali-Kao, without music and without geography, no longer setting out for the hacienda where the roots think of the child and &quot;where the wine is finished off with fables from an old almanac&quot;. That’s all over. You’ll never see the hacienda. It doesn’t exist.

&quot;The hacienda must be built&quot;.&quot;

He and his friend Henry de Béarn planned to blow up the Eiffel Tower with some dynamite they had stolen from a nearby building site, because &quot;its reflected light shone into their shared attic room and kept them awake at night.&quot; He was arrested at &quot;Les Cinq Billards&quot; on Rue Mouffetard in Paris and committed to a mental hospital by his wife, where he was subdued with insulin and shock therapy, and remained for 5 years. He died in 1998.

<doc id="267527" wikidata="Q4702804" url="?curid=267527" title="Al-Manshiyya, Acre">
<text>Al-Manshiyya (), was a Palestinian village with a Muslim orphanage and a mosque known as the mosque of Abu &#x27;Atiyya, which is still standing. 

The area just north of the village was a garden planted by Sulayman Pasha, who was the ruler of Acre in the early 19th century, named , Qasr Bahjī, &quot;mansion of delight&quot;; today this is known as the shrine of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, who was the founder of the Baháʼí Faith.

==History==
Five graves were excavated in al-Manshiyya in 1955–56; the earliest dated from the thirteenth century BC.

The people of Al-Manshiyya believed that the village was established in the aftermath of the Crusades, and the original inhabitants were brought to the area from North Africa by the Mamluks to populate the area. However, the village must have disintegrated subsequently, as it is not mentioned in the 1596 census. The local shrine of Abu Atabi has a construction text dating it to 1140 AH (1727–28 CE). It is probably it Richard Pococke refers to when he passed by in 1738: &quot;On the highest ground of it are the ruins of a very strong square tower, and near it, is a mosque, a tower, and other great buildings; the place is called &quot;Abouotidy&quot;, from a Sheik who was buried there.&quot; In 1760, :it:Giovanni Mariti called the place &quot;Bahattbe&quot;: &quot;situated on a small eminence, which contains the ruins of an ancient temple, employed as a place of worship both by the Turks and Christians, but at different periods. Some paces further is a mosque, remarkable on account of its burying-ground, in which was interred a prodigious number of infidels, who perished under the walls of Acre.&quot;

A map from 1799 showed the place as an &quot;uninhabited ruin&quot;, while Guérin, who visited in 1875, observed that the village is &quot;newly founded&quot;. In 1881, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) described the village of Al-Manshiyya as being situated on a plain, surrounded by arable land, with houses built of stone and adobe. It had a population of about 150.

A population list from about 1887 showed that &quot;Kiryet el Menshiyeh&quot; had about 400 inhabitants, all Muslim.

===British Mandate era===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities &quot;Al Manshiyeh&quot; had a population of 371; all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 460, still all Muslims, in a total of 132 houses.

In the 1945 statistics, Al-Manshiyya had 810 Muslim inhabitants and 270 Jewish inhabitants, with a total of of land according to an official land and population survey.
The economy of the village was based on agriculture. In 1944/45 253 dunams was used for citrus and bananas, 10,818 dunams were allotted to cereals, 619 dunams were irrigated or used for orchards, while 27 dunams were built-up (urban) land.

===1948 and aftermath===
The villagers, who were farmers, lived peacefully and had significant interaction with their Jewish neighbors. But the fighting in Acre, and later, the Deir Yassin massacre, frightened them. The village was first drawn into the 1948 Arab–Israeli War on 6 February 1948. On that day a number of armed Jews, using automatic weapons and Sten guns, attacked the village. They were driven back by village defenders.

Manshiyya was captured by on 14 May 1948 during Operation Ben-Ami. One villager recalled that the dawn attack came from the hill overlooking the village. The villagers, &quot;with bullets whizzing over their heads&quot;, ran towards the east &quot;because all other sides were surrounded by the Jews&quot;. When they returned to remove the dead bodies, they found the village strewn with mines. One former villager recounted that her father returned to Al-Manshiyya about 10 days after the attack and found it had been razed. On 16 June 1948, David Ben-Gurion mentioned Manshiyya as one of the villages Israel had destroyed.

Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel. Two new villages, Shomrat and Bustan HaGalil, were established in 1948 on village land, north of the village site. The site is now part of the city of Acre.

According to the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, the remaining structures on the village land were in 1992: &quot;The Baha&#x27;i shrine, the mosque, the Islamic school for orphans, and a few houses still stand; the rest of the village is gone. The shrine is a handsome, domed structure, the front wall and arched entrance of which are framed by prominent stone pillars. The mosque, a stone structure with a dome and vaulted ceilings, has been turned into a private home for a Jewish family. The former Islamic school for orphans is also inhabited. The cemetery is still visible but is not tended; it contains a tombstone that is inscribed in Turkish and dates to the eighteenth century. The al-Basha water canal, built with stone blocks, still exists, but is not functioning; the same is also true of an aqueduct.&quot;

Andrew Petersen, an archaeologist specializing in Islamic architecture, visited Al-Manshiyya in 1994. He found the mosque and shrine of Abu Atabi was still standing, though it has been turned into a residential complex since 1948. The prayer room functioned as a living room. An inscription in two parts was set above the doorway leading to the domed chamber containing the tomb. The date 1140 H (1727–28 C.E.) was still visible in the upper part, while the lower part, written in larger ornamental script might be earlier, possibly dating to Mamluk times. Abu Atabi is said locally to be a Muslim warrior from the time of the Crusades, killed during the siege of Acre.

<text>Al-Sumayriyya (, &quot;Katasir&quot; in Canaanite times, &quot;Someleria&quot; during Crusader rule), was a Palestinian village located six kilometers north of Acre that was depopulated after it was captured by the Israel Defense Forces during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The ruins of the village are today in the outskirts of the Israeli moshav of Regba.

==History==
Tall al-Sumayriyya contains carved stones, a mosaic floor, tombs, columns, and stone capitals. Khirbat Abu &#x27;Ataba has an Islamic shrine and ceramic fragments.

In the Crusader era, it was mentioned in 1277 under the name of &quot;Somelaria&quot;. At the time, the village belonged to the Templars. In the hudna of 1283 between Al Mansur Qalawun and the Crusaders, Al-Sumayriyya was still under Crusader rule while in 1291 it had come under Mamluk control.

A building with a court-yard, measuring 60,5 by 57 meters, dating from the Crusader era, has been noted in the village, and a 13th-century glass-factory has been excavated.

===Ottoman era===
It was mentioned in the Ottoman defter for the year 1555-6, named &quot;Summayriyah&quot;, located in the &quot;Nahiya&quot; of Akka of the &quot;Liwa&quot; of Safad, and with its land designated as &quot;Sahi&quot; land, that is, land belonging to the Sultan.

In 1738 Richard Pococke passed by the place, which he called &quot;Semmars&quot;. He thought the name came from &quot;St. Mary&#x27;s&quot;, and noted the remains of a wall of hewn stone, which he thought had belonged to a convent.

A map by Pierre Jacotin from Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of 1799 showed the place, named as &quot;El Esmerieh&quot;.

In 1875 Victor Guérin found the village had 400 Muslim inhabitants. 
In 1881, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described the place as a village of &quot;mud and stone houses, containing about 200 [..] Moslems, situated on the plain, surrounded by a few clumps of olives and figs and arable land; two or three cisterns are in the village, the aqueduct near brings good water.&quot;

A population list from about 1887 showed the village to have about 270 inhabitants; all Muslims.

===British Mandate era===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities &quot;Semariyeh&quot; had a population of 307; 300 Muslims and 7 Christians, where all the Christians were Maronite. This had increased in the 1931 census to 392, 390 Muslims, 1 Christian and 1 Jew, in a total of 92 houses.

Al-Sumayriyya had an elementary school for boys, which was founded in 1943. In 1945, it had an enrollment of 60 students.
One mosque which remains.

In 1944/1945 the village had a population of 760 Muslims, with a total of 8,542 dunams of land. Of this, 6,854 dunams were allocated to grain crops; 354 dunams were irrigated or planted with orchards, while 28 dunams were built-up (urban) land.

===1948, and aftermath===
At the beginning of 1945, al-Sumayriyya&#x27;s 760 inhabitants were all Arab Muslims. The inhabitants fled as a result of the 14 May 1948 assault on the village by the Carmeli Brigade during Operation Ben-Ami, one day before the official outbreak of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The village - along with neighbouring al-Bassa and al-Zib which were also captured in the offensive - was subsequently destroyed, except its mosque.

Lohamei HaGeta&#x27;ot and Shomrat are both on village land. Morris writes that Bustan HaGalil was built near its site, however, Khalidi writes that Bustan HaGalil is on the land of Al-Manshiyya. Shavey Tziyon and Regba are close to the northern borders of Al-Sumayriyya, but were established on land that used to belong to Mazra&#x27;a.

<doc id="267535" wikidata="Q5333299" url="?curid=267535" title="Environment of Hong Kong">
<text>The ecology of Hong Kong is mostly affected by the results of climatic changes. Hong Kong&#x27;s climate is seasonal due to alternating wind direction between winter and summer.

Hong Kong has been geologically stable for millions of years. Flora and fauna in Hong Kong are altered by climatic change, sea level alternation, and human impact.

==Climate==
Hong Kong has a subtropical climate, which is additionally influenced by the monsoon in spring. The average daily maximum temperatures range from 19 to 32 degrees, depending on the season. There are hot, humid summers and temperate, dry winters. With daily highs of 33 °C, it is warmest from late May to mid-September. Over 2200 liters of rain per square meter fall annually - 80% of it between May and September. Of these, June and August are the wettest months, with rain falling on almost four out of seven days. With only one rainy day per week in January and December, these are the driest months. Between late May and mid-September, typhoons and violent thunderstorms can occasionally occur.

==Land==
The total land area of Hong Kong is 1,076 square kilometres, but about 75% of this land is open countryside, which contains more than 2600 species of vascular plants, about 450 species of birds, about 200 species of butterflies, about 100 species of dragonflies, 40 species of mammals, 80 species of reptiles and more than 20 species of amphibians, including some that are endemic to the territory.

==Species richness in Hong Kong==

Hong Kong is considered rich in species variety. The number of bird species in Hong Kong is fully one-third of that in China along with one-sixth as many butterflies species, according to surveys.

The horseshoe crabs &quot;Tachypleus tridentatus&quot; and &quot;Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda&quot; are found in Hong Kong&#x27;s waters, and there are reported sighting of &quot;Tachypleus gigas&quot;.

==Ecosystems in Hong Kong==

===Mangroves===
Mangroves are habitats of enclosed intertidal mud flats with greatly reduced wave action, located near sources of fresh water. Popular mangrove habitats in Hong Kong are located along Deep Bay, such as Pak Nai and Tsim Bei Tsui, where salinity is very low under the influence of fresh water from the Pearl River, and along some mud flats where salinity is lowered by surrounding streams, such as Three Fathoms Cove and Ting Kok. Trees living in this habitat are called mangrove trees.

The following are sites of mangroves in Hong Kong:

*Deep Bay
*Hebe Haven
*Hoi Ha Wan
*Kei Ling Ha
*Long Harbour
*Pui O
*Tai Ho Wan
*Tai O
*Tai Tam Harbour
*Tolo Harbour
*Tung Chung


===Rocky shores===
The tidal range of Hong Kong is about 2.5 metres and the distribution of species situated in this region must be tolerant of conditions when the shore is covered with seawater at high tide and when the shore is directly exposed to the air at low tide, for hours or days. Species may adapt to these varying conditions by successfully exploiting narrow vertical zones along the rocky shore.

The species inhabiting Hong Kong&#x27;s rocky coastal areas vary depending the exposure to the wave action from the sea. The sessile filter-feeding organisms inhabit the wave-exposed shoreline. They are able to attach on the rock surface and remove food particles in the turbulent water, while the mobile herbivores and carnivores prefer the sheltered shores. The varieties of organisms also varies with the season, especially in Hong Kong where oceanic currents change through the year. For instance, very few erect foliose macro-algae can tolerate Hong Kong&#x27;s summer heat, but they are common in winter.

The following are the sites of rocky shores in Hong Kong:
*Luk Keng
*Kei Ling Ha Lo Wai
*Cape D&#x27;Aguilar Marine Reserve

===Streams===
There are two kinds of freshwater habitats: lentic (still, or very slow moving) water, such as lakes, ponds, ditches, and lotic (flowing) water, such as rivers, streams.

There are three main factors to differentiate the habitats in Hong Kong: variability of current, amount of detritus and variable oxygen content. These factors influence animals&#x27; various adaptive responses. They have to attach themselves to the surfaces, become predominantly detritus feeders and have a mechanism for obtaining maximum oxygen supply.

The following are the list of rivers in Hong Kong:
*Wa Mei Shan
*Lam Tsuen River
*Shing Mun River

===Sandy shores===
The following are the site of sandy shores in Hong Kong:

*Starfish Bay

==Problems==

===Pollution===

====General====
In 1989, the Hong Kong government realised that Hong Kong was in danger of becoming a vast, densely populated city. Due to the growth of the economy and business sectors, the water, waste and air pollution cause an adverse effect on the balance of ecology in Hong Kong.

Factories, farms and restaurants in the New Territories dump large amounts of sewage and even untreated waste into the streams and the sea. It makes the New Territories&#x27; streams be &#x27;no better than open sewers&#x27;. This severe damage is irreversible and the creatures in the sea are the direct victims.

The pink dolphin is one of the victims. Under threat from chemical pollution, increased sea traffic and the destruction of much of the natural shoreline for land reclamation, the number of pink dolphins has dramatically declined with the city&#x27;s ongoing development.

The nature reserve and birds in Mai Po Marsh are also victims. They are threatened by pig sewage flooding as well as the increased pollution from Shenzhen. Yet according to World Wide Fund for Nature Hong Kong the number of the endangered black-faced spoonbills wintering in Mai Po has risen from roughly 35 in the late 1980s to 152 after 10 years. About 400 have been spotted after 2000. Estimates on how many of these birds remain in the wild vary from 1,000 to 2,000.

The oyster farms have been throttled by a mixture of pollution and competition from cheaper oyster cultivation across the border in China.

====Air pollution====

Air pollution is another serious problem. Smoke-belching factories, intense construction and large numbers of diesel vehicles have led to dangerous levels of particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide. It&#x27;s not only the flora and fauna that are affected – humans are too. Cases of asthma and bronchial infections have soared in recent years, and doctors place the blame squarely on poor air quality.

====Thermal pollution====
According to a Baptist University study, daily average minimum temperatures have increased by 0.02 degrees (Celsius) annually between 1965 and 2003, due to the urban heat island effect, which traps heat during the daytime and releases it at night. Average daily maximum temperatures have fallen by 0.014 degrees each year, as air pollution blocks solar radiation. Resulting increased nighttime ambient temperatures incite families to use domestic air-conditioning, which further compounds the problem.

Research has shown that the ambient air-temperature in urban areas can be some 5 °C higher than non built-up areas. The Hong Kong Polytechnic University commissioned NASA to take a high-resolution thermal image of urban Hong Kong by satellite at 22:40 on 4 August 2007, which showed at least a four-degree difference between the coolest areas and the &quot;urban heat islands&quot;. The variations are attributable to greater absorbency of man-made materials, and building density that restrict air-flow. The affected area had expanded into Hung Hom since January, when the first image was taken.

====&quot;Wall effect&quot;====

There has been increasing concern since 2006 over the &quot;wall effect&quot; caused by uniform high-rise developments that adversely impact air circulation. Due to the density of Hong Kong&#x27;s population and the economies of scale of mass developments, there is the tendency of new private tower block developments with 10 to over 100 towers, ranging from 30 to 70 stories high. Developers of housing estates are financially motivated to maximise the view, at the expense of the free flow of air. Huge wall-like estates along the waterfront are often constructed.

In-fill developments are typically constructed by smaller developers with less capital. These will be smaller in scale, and less prone to the wall effect.

Environmental group Green Sense expressed concern that their survey on 155 housing estates found 104 have a &#x27;wall-like&#x27; design. It cited estates in Tai Kok Tsui and Tseung Kwan O as the &quot;best examples&quot;. In May 2007, citing concern over developments in West Kowloon, and near Tai Wai and Yuen Long railway stations, some legislators called for a law to stop developers from constructing tall buildings that adversely affect airflow in densely populated areas, but the bid failed. In 2007, residents of Tai Kok Tsui, increasingly aware of the problem, have been lobbying against the further proliferation of such high-rises in their area that threaten the last air corridor.

===Threats to flora and fauna===

====Destruction of habitat====
*Encroachment of the green belt
*Effect of the Building Waste Levy

====Illegal hunting of species by mainland Chinese====
With increasing affluence of mainland Chinese, some of them become affable to some luxury flora and fauna, like &quot;Podocarpus macrophyllus&quot; (; Cantonese: lo hon chung) and &quot;Cuora trifasciata&quot; (; Cantonese: kam chin kwai). Some luxury species are becoming increasingly rare in South China due to increased hunting, and hunters turn to Hong Kong.

====Introduction of non-indigenous species====
Most of the introduced species do little harm to the ecology of Hong Kong.
However, some species are invasive and cause massive damage to the ecology and/or economy of Hong Kong.

Examples are the pinewood nematode from North America and pine-needle scale insect from Taiwan, which together virtually eliminated the native &quot;Pinus massoniana&quot; in the 1970s and 1980s.

<text>Suruh (), was a Palestinian Arab hamlet, located northeast of Acre. It became depopulated in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.

==History==
Suruh contained two &quot;khirbats&quot; (&quot;sites of ruins&quot;) with a variety of ancient artifacts, including cisterns, and rock-hewn tombs.

===Ottoman era===
An 1875 visitor, Victor Guérin, describes it as a ruin, which he called &quot;Khurbet Seroueh&quot;. Guérin noted; &quot;These ruins cover the summit of the hill. At the highest point we observed the remains of a very ancient square tower, measuring fourteen paces on each side, the lower courses consisting of very large blocks, roughly squared and without cement. The interior is full of similar blocks, piled up in confusion, in the midst of which terebinths and pomegranates have taken root. Near this tower a few old houses served as an asylum to four families of Metawileh. On the lintel of the door of one of these houses a square cross inscribed in a circle can still be traced. The terraces of another house are supported in the interior by arched arcades in good cut stone of Roman, or at least Byzantine, date. There are also the remains of numerous houses which have been destroyed, a dozen cisterns cut in the rock, a column lying on the ground, and the fragment of a sarcophagus.&quot;

In 1881, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) described Suruh as &quot;a small village, containing about ninety Moslems, situated on a ridge, with olives and arable land round; there are three rock-cut cisterns. The residents lived by agriculture and raising live-stock.

===British Mandate era===
In the 1945 statistics the population Tarbikha, Al-Nabi Rubin and Suruh together was 1000 Muslims, and they had a total of 18,563 dunams of land. 619 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 3,204 used for cereals, while 112 dunams were built-up (urban) land.

===1948, and aftermath===
During the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, the inhabitants of Suruh, the neighbouring hamlet of Nabi Rubin and the main village of Tarbikha, were given expulsion orders by Israeli forces. A predominantly Sunni Muslim hamlet, Suruh and Nabi Rubin were satellite hamlets of Tarbikha, a largely Shi&#x27;ite village. Most of Suruh&#x27;s inhabitants and those the neighbouring localities ended up leaving to Lebanon.

In 1992 the village site was described: &quot;Only rubble, trees, cactuses, shrubs, and weeds are visible. Most of the site is used for grazing.&quot;

<doc id="267538" wikidata="Q667290" url="?curid=267538" title="HAL/S">
<text>HAL/S (&quot;High-order Assembly Language/Shuttle&quot;) is a real-time aerospace programming language compiler and cross-compiler for avionics applications used by NASA and associated agencies (JPL, etc.). It has been used in many U.S. space projects since 1973 and its most significant use was in the Space Shuttle program (approximately 85% of the Shuttle software was coded in HAL/S). It was designed by Intermetrics in 1972 for NASA and delivered in 1973. HAL/S is written in XPL, a dialect of PL/I. Although HAL/S is designed primarily for programming on-board computers, it is general enough to meet nearly all the needs in the production, verification, and support of aerospace and other real-time applications. According to documentation from 2005, it was being maintained by the HAL/S project of United Space Alliance.

==Goals and principles==
The three key principles in designing the language were reliability, efficiency, and machine-independence. The language is designed to allow aerospace-related tasks (such as vector/matrix arithmetic) to be accomplished in a way that is easily understandable by people who have spaceflight knowledge, but may not necessarily have proficiency with computer programming.

HAL/S was designed not to include some constructs that were thought to be the cause of errors. For instance, there is no support for dynamic memory allocation. The language provides special support for real-time execution environments.

Some features, such as &quot;GOTO&quot; were provided chiefly to ease mechanical translations from other languages. (page 82) 

&quot;HAL&quot; was suggested as the name of the new language by Ed Copps, a founding director of Intermetrics, to honor Hal Laning, a colleague at MIT. On the Preface page of the HAL/S Language Specification, it says,
A proposal for a NASA standard ground-based version of HAL named HAL/G for &quot;ground&quot; was proposed, but the coming emergence of the soon to be named Ada programming language contributed to Intermetrics&#x27; lack of interest in continuing this work. Instead, Intermetrics would place emphasis on what would be the &quot;Red&quot; finalist which would not be selected.

Host compiler systems have been implemented on an IBM 360/370, Data General Eclipse, and the Modcomp IV/Classic computers. Target computer systems have included IBM 360/370, IBM AP-101 (space shuttle avionics computer), Sperry 1819A/1819B, Data General Nova and Eclipse, CII Mitra 125, Modcomp II and IV, NASA Std. Spacecraft Computer-l and Computer-2, ITEK ATAC 16M (Galileo Project), and since 1978 the RCA CDP1802 COSMAC microprocessor (Galileo Project and others).

==Syntax==
HAL/S is a mostly free-form language: statements may begin anywhere on a line and may spill over the next lines, and multiple statements may be fitted onto the same line if required. However, non-space characters in the first column of a program line may have special significance. For instance, the letter &#x27;C&#x27; in the first column indicates that the whole line is a comment and should be ignored by the compiler.

One particularly interesting feature of HAL/S is that it supports, in addition to a normal single line text format, an optional three-line input format in which three source code lines are used for each statement. In this format, the first and third lines are usable for superscripts (exponents) and subscripts (indices). The multi-line format was designed to permit writing of HAL/S code that is similar to mathematical notation.

As an example, the statement formula_1 could be written in single-line format as:
 X = A ** 2 + B$(I) ** 2 
Exponentiation is denoted by two asterisks, as in PL/I and Fortran. The subscript formula_2 is denoted by a dollar sign, with the subscript expression enclosed in parentheses. The same code fragment could be written in multiple-line format as:
 E 2 2
 M X = A + B
 S I 
In the example, the base line of the statement is indicated by an &#x27;M&#x27; in the first column, the exponent line is indicated by an &#x27;E&#x27;, and the subscript line is indicated by an &#x27;S&#x27;.

==Example==

The following is a simple HAL/S program. Every program begins with a labeled codice_1 statement; the label consists of an identifier followed by a colon. All variables must be declared in the codice_2 group, which precedes any executable statements. Every program ends with a codice_3 delimiting statement.

==Data types==
HAL/S has native support for integers, floating point scalars, vector, matrices, booleans and strings of 8-bit characters, limited to a maximum length of 255. Structured types may be composed using a codice_4 statement.

<text>Al-Tall (), was a Palestinian village 14 km northeast of Acre in the British Mandate District of Acre. Depopulated as a result of military assault and capture during the 1947-1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine as part of Operation Operation Ben-Ami by the Carmeli Brigade of the Israel Defense Forces.

==History==
The twin villages of Al-Tall and nearby Al-Nahr were both sites of ancient settlements atop the tel of Kabri. Recent excavations indicate habitation back to the eighteenth century BC.

===Ottoman era===
In the Ottoman period, a mill was shown here on Pierre Jacotin´s map from 1799.
In 1875, the French explorer Victor Guérin visited the village, which he called &quot;Et-Tell&quot;. He described it: &quot;Below the village extend fresh and verdant gardens where the water flows and murmurs incessantly in little canals, and where lofty poplars and great nut-trees, which recall Europe, mingle with the trees of Palestine. Near here is a mill, worked by water falling from a higher basin, which acts as a reservoir for a spring as abundant as that of Ras el &#x27;Ain. After leaving the mill, the water forms a stream which fertilises the adjacent orchards. This raised and broad reservoir, whence the water escapes by an opening made for the purpose in the edge of the reservoir, is of modern construction, as is shown by the stones; but its first building must be ancient, because it is difficult to believe that the ancients should have neglected to get all the advantage possible from so important a spring.&quot;

In 1881 the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described the village as &quot;A stone and adobe village, containing about 200
Moslems, with figs, olive, pomegranate, and mulberry trees and gardens; there are two streams of water at this village.&quot; The layout of the village was rectangular. Its houses were built from stone and concrete or from mud.

A population list from about 1887 showed that &quot;Nahret Tell&quot; had about 275 inhabitants, all Muslim.

===British era===
In 1944/1945, the population of Al-Tall was 300.

===Israeli rule===
Al-Tall was captured by the Carmeli Brigade during Operation Ben-Ami. Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel, but the village&#x27;s land has not been incorporated into any municipality or village.

According to the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, the remaining structures on the village land were in 1992:
&quot;The site is covered with the rubble of stone houses and is overgrown with wild grass. One stone house still stands but its facade is missing and it is about to crumble. Cactuses and fig trees grow on the southern slopes of the site. There are four identifiable Roman and Byzantine tombs in the cemetery that lies on the northern slopes, a Christ-thorn tree stands in its midst. Recent excavations has uncovered several ancient graves, and the place has been turned into an archaeological site.&quot;

In 1993, when A. Petersen visited the place, the only structure he found standing was a cistern, known as Birket al-Mafshukh, located north of the tell. In 1881, it had been described as a &quot;birket of masonry, and a large perennial spring, with a stream flowing from it to the sea; the stream is called the Nahr Mefshukh; gives a very plentiful supply of water.&quot; According to Petersen, the birkat was &quot;rectangular with a semi-circular extension at the west end.&quot;

<doc id="267542" wikidata="Q785426" url="?curid=267542" title="Science in the medieval Islamic world">
<text>Science in the medieval Islamic world was the science developed and practised during the Islamic Golden Age under the Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad, the Umayyads of Córdoba, the Abbadids of Seville, the Samanids, the Ziyarids and the Buyids in Persia and beyond, spanning the period roughly between 786 and 1258. Islamic scientific achievements encompassed a wide range of subject areas, especially astronomy, mathematics, and medicine. Other subjects of scientific inquiry included alchemy and chemistry, botany and agronomy, geography and cartography, ophthalmology, pharmacology, physics, and zoology.

Medieval Islamic science had practical purposes as well as the goal of understanding. For example, astronomy was useful for determining the &quot;Qibla&quot;, the direction in which to pray, botany had practical application in agriculture, as in the works of Ibn Bassal and Ibn al-&#x27;Awwam, and geography enabled Abu Zayd al-Balkhi to make accurate maps. Islamic mathematicians such as Al-Khwarizmi, Avicenna and Jamshīd al-Kāshī made advances in algebra, trigonometry, geometry and Arabic numerals. Islamic doctors described diseases like smallpox and measles, and challenged classical Greek medical theory. Al-Biruni, Avicenna and others described the preparation of hundreds of drugs made from medicinal plants and chemical compounds. Islamic physicists such as Ibn Al-Haytham, Al-Bīrūnī and others studied optics and mechanics as well as astronomy, and criticised Aristotle&#x27;s view of motion.

During the Middle Ages, Islamic science flourished across a wide area around the Mediterranean Sea and further afield, for several centuries, in a wide range of institutions.

==Context and history==

The Islamic era began in 622. Islamic armies eventually conquered Arabia, Egypt and Mesopotamia, and successfully displaced the Persian and Byzantine Empires from the region within a few decades. Within a century, Islam had reached the area of present-day Portugal in the west and Central Asia in the east. The Islamic Golden Age (roughly between 786 and 1258) spanned the period of the Abbasid Caliphate (750–1258), with stable political structures and flourishing trade. Major religious and cultural works of the Islamic empire were translated into Arabic and occasionally Persian. Islamic culture inherited Greek, Indic, Assyrian and Persian influences. A new common civilisation formed, based on Islam. An era of high culture and innovation ensued, with rapid growth in population and cities. The Arab Agricultural Revolution in the countryside brought more crops and improved agricultural technology, especially irrigation. This supported the larger population and enabled culture to flourish. From the 9th century onwards, scholars such as Al-Kindi translated Indian, Assyrian, Sasanian (Persian) and Greek knowledge, including the works of Aristotle, into Arabic. These translations supported advances by scientists across the Islamic world.

Islamic science survived the initial Christian reconquest of Spain, including the fall of Seville in 1248, as work continued in the eastern centres (such as in Persia). After the completion of the Spanish reconquest in 1492, the Islamic world went into an economic and cultural decline. The Abbasid caliphate was followed by the Ottoman Empire ( 1299–1922), centred in Turkey, and the Safavid Empire (1501–1736), centred in Persia, where work in the arts and sciences continued.

==Fields of inquiry==
Medieval Islamic scientific achievements encompassed a wide range of subject areas, especially mathematics, astronomy, and medicine. Other subjects of scientific inquiry included physics, alchemy and chemistry, ophthalmology, and geography and cartography.

===Alchemy and chemistry ===
The early Islamic period saw the establishment of theoretical frameworks in alchemy and chemistry. The sulfur-mercury theory of metals, first found in &quot;Sirr al-khalīqa&quot; (&quot;The Secret of Creation&quot;, c. 750–850, falsely attributed to Apollonius of Tyana), and in the writings attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan (written c. 850–950), remained the basis of theories of metallic composition until the 18th century. The &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot;, a cryptic text that all later alchemists up to and including Isaac Newton saw as the foundation of their art, first occurs in the &quot;Sirr al-khalīqa&quot; and in one of the works attributed to Jabir. In practical chemistry, the works of Jabir, and those of the Persian alchemist and physician Abu Bakr al-Razi (c. 865–925), contain the earliest systematic classifications of chemical substances. Alchemists were also interested in artificially creating such substances. Jabir describes the synthesis of ammonium chloride (sal ammoniac) from organic substances, and Abu Bakr al-Razi experimented with the heating of ammonium chloride, vitriol, and other salts, which would eventually lead to the discovery of the mineral acids by 13th-century Latin alchemists such as pseudo-Geber.

===Astronomy and cosmology===

Astronomy became a major discipline within Islamic science. Astronomers devoted effort both towards understanding the nature of the cosmos and to practical purposes. One application involved determining the &quot;Qibla&quot;, the direction to face during prayer. Another was astrology, predicting events affecting human life and selecting suitable times for actions such as going to war or founding a city. Al-Battani (850–922) accurately determined the length of the solar year. He contributed to the Tables of Toledo, used by astronomers to predict the movements of the sun, moon and planets across the sky. Copernicus (1473–1543) later used some of Al-Battani&#x27;s astronomic tables.

Al-Zarqali (1028–1087) developed a more accurate astrolabe, used for centuries afterwards. He constructed a water clock in Toledo, discovered that the Sun&#x27;s apogee moves slowly relative to the fixed stars, and obtained a good estimate of its motion for its rate of change. Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201–1274) wrote an important revision to Ptolemy&#x27;s 2nd-century celestial model. When Tusi became Helagu&#x27;s astrologer, he was given an observatory and gained access to Chinese techniques and observations. He developed trigonometry as a separate field, and compiled the most accurate astronomical tables available up to that time.

===Botany and agronomy===


The study of the natural world extended to a detailed examination of plants. The work done proved directly useful in the unprecedented growth of pharmacology across the Islamic world. Al-Dinawari (815–896) popularised botany in the Islamic world with his six-volume &quot;Kitab al-Nabat&quot; (&quot;Book of Plants&quot;). Only volumes 3 and 5 have survived, with part of volume 6 reconstructed from quoted passages. The surviving text describes 637 plants in alphabetical order from the letters &quot;sin&quot; to &quot;ya&quot;, so the whole book must have covered several thousand kinds of plants. Al-Dinawari described the phases of plant growth and the production of flowers and fruit. The thirteenth century encyclopedia compiled by Zakariya al-Qazwini (1203–1283) – &quot;ʿAjā&#x27;ib al-makhlūqāt&quot; (The Wonders of Creation) – contained, among many other topics, both realistic botany and fantastic accounts. For example, he described trees which grew birds on their twigs in place of leaves, but which could only be found in the far-distant British Isles. The use and cultivation of plants was documented in the 11th century by Muhammad bin Ibrāhīm Ibn Bassāl of Toledo in his book &quot;Dīwān al-filāha&quot; (The Court of Agriculture), and by Ibn al-&#x27;Awwam al-Ishbīlī (also called Abū l-Khayr al-Ishbīlī) of Seville in his 12th century book &quot;Kitāb al-Filāha&quot; (Treatise on Agriculture). Ibn Bassāl had travelled widely across the Islamic world, returning with a detailed knowledge of agronomy that fed into the Arab Agricultural Revolution. His practical and systematic book describes over 180 plants and how to propagate and care for them. It covered leaf- and root-vegetables, herbs, spices and trees.

===Geography and cartography===

The spread of Islam across Western Asia and North Africa encouraged an unprecedented growth in trade and travel by land and sea as far away as Southeast Asia, China, much of Africa, Scandinavia and even Iceland. Geographers worked to compile increasingly accurate maps of the known world, starting from many existing but fragmentary sources. Abu Zayd al-Balkhi (850–934), founder of the Balkhī school of cartography in Baghdad, wrote an atlas called &quot;Figures of the Regions&quot; (Suwar al-aqalim).
Al-Biruni (973–1048) measured the radius of the earth using a new method. It involved observing the height of a mountain at Nandana (now in Pakistan). Al-Idrisi (1100–1166) drew a map of the world for Roger, the Norman King of Sicily (ruled 1105–1154). He also wrote the &quot;Tabula Rogeriana&quot; (Book of Roger), a geographic study of the peoples, climates, resources and industries of the whole of the world known at that time. The Ottoman admiral Piri Reis ( 1470–1553) made a map of the New World and West Africa in 1513. He made use of maps from Greece, Portugal, Muslim sources, and perhaps one made by Christopher Columbus. He represented a part of a major tradition of Ottoman cartography.

===Mathematics===

Islamic mathematicians gathered, organised and clarified the mathematics they inherited from ancient Egypt, Greece, India, Mesopotamia and Persia, and went on to make innovations of their own. Islamic mathematics covered algebra, geometry and arithmetic. Algebra was mainly used for recreation: it had few practical applications at that time. Geometry was studied at different levels. Some texts contain practical geometrical rules for surveying and for measuring figures. Theoretical geometry was a necessary prerequisite for understanding astronomy and optics, and it required years of concentrated work. Early in the Abbasid caliphate (founded 750), soon after the foundation of Baghdad in 762, some mathematical knowledge was assimilated by al-Mansur&#x27;s group of scientists from the pre-Islamic Persian tradition in astronomy. Astronomers from India were invited to the court of the caliph in the late eighth century; they explained the rudimentary trigonometrical techniques used in Indian astronomy. Ancient Greek works such as Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot; and Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; were translated into Arabic. By the second half of the ninth century, Islamic mathematicians were already making contributions to the most sophisticated parts of Greek geometry. Islamic mathematics reached its apogee in the Eastern part of the Islamic world between the tenth and twelfth centuries. Most medieval Islamic mathematicians wrote in Arabic, others in Persian.

Al-Khwarizmi (8th–9th centuries) was instrumental in the adoption of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system and the development of algebra, introduced methods of simplifying equations, and used Euclidean geometry in his proofs. He was the first to treat algebra as an independent discipline in its own right, and presented the first systematic solution of linear and quadratic equations.
Ibn Ishaq al-Kindi (801–873) worked on cryptography for the Abbasid Caliphate, and gave the first known recorded explanation of cryptanalysis and the first description of the method of frequency analysis.
Avicenna ( 980–1037) contributed to mathematical techniques such as casting out nines. Thābit ibn Qurra (835–901) calculated the solution to a chessboard problem involving an exponential series.
Al-Farabi ( 870–950) attempted to describe, geometrically, the repeating patterns popular in Islamic decorative motifs in his book &quot;Spiritual Crafts and Natural Secrets in the Details of Geometrical Figures&quot;. Omar Khayyam (1048–1131), known in the West as a poet, calculated the length of the year to within 5 decimal places, and found geometric solutions to all 13 forms of cubic equations, developing some quadratic equations still in use. Jamshīd al-Kāshī (c. 1380–1429) is credited with several theorems of trigonometry, including the law of cosines, also known as Al-Kashi&#x27;s Theorem. He has been credited with the invention of decimal fractions, and with a method like Horner&#x27;s to calculate roots. He calculated π correctly to 17 significant figures.

Sometime around the seventh century, Islamic scholars adopted the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, describing their use in a standard type of text &quot;fī l-ḥisāb al hindī&quot;, (On the numbers of the Indians). A distinctive Western Arabic variant of the Eastern Arabic numerals began to emerge around the 10th century in the Maghreb and Al-Andalus (sometimes called &quot;ghubar&quot; numerals, though the term is not always accepted), which are the direct ancestor of the modern Arabic numerals used throughout the world.

===Medicine===

Islamic society paid careful attention to medicine, following a &quot;hadith&quot; enjoining the preservation of good health. Its physicians inherited knowledge and traditional medical beliefs from the civilisations of classical Greece, Rome, Syria, Persia and India. These included the writings of Hippocrates such as on the theory of the four humours, and the theories of Galen. al-Razi ( 865–925) identified smallpox and measles, and recognized fever as a part of the body&#x27;s defenses. He wrote a 23-volume compendium of Chinese, Indian, Persian, Syriac and Greek medicine. al-Razi questioned the classical Greek medical theory of how the four humours regulate life processes. He challenged Galen&#x27;s work on several fronts, including the treatment of bloodletting, arguing that it was effective.
al-Zahrawi (936–1013) was a surgeon whose most important surviving work is referred to as &quot;al-Tasrif&quot; (Medical Knowledge). It is a 30-volume set mainly discussing medical symptoms, treatments, and pharmacology. The last volume, on surgery, describes surgical instruments, supplies, and pioneering procedures. Avicenna (c. 980–1037) wrote the major medical textbook, &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot;. Ibn al-Nafis (1213–1288) wrote an influential book on medicine; it largely replaced Avicenna&#x27;s &quot;Canon&quot; in the Islamic world. He wrote commentaries on Galen and on Avicenna&#x27;s works. One of these commentaries, discovered in 1924, described the circulation of blood through the lungs.

===Optics and ophthalmology===


Optics developed rapidly in this period. By the ninth century, there were works on physiological, geometrical and physical optics. Topics covered included mirror reflection.
Hunayn ibn Ishaq (809–873) wrote the book &quot;Ten Treatises on the Eye&quot;; this remained influential in the West until the 17th century.
Abbas ibn Firnas (810–887) developed lenses for magnification and the improvement of vision.
Ibn Sahl ( 940–1000) discovered the law of refraction known as Snell&#x27;s law. He used the law to produce the first Aspheric lenses that focused light without geometric aberrations.

In the eleventh century Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen, 965–1040) rejected the Greek ideas about vision, whether the Aristotelian tradition that held that the form of the perceived object entered the eye (but not its matter), or that of Euclid and Ptolemy which held that the eye emitted a ray. Al-Haytham proposed in his &quot;Book of Optics&quot; that vision occurs by way of light rays forming a cone with its vertex at the center of the eye. He suggested that light was reflected from different surfaces in different directions, thus causing objects to look different. He argued further that the mathematics of reflection and refraction needed to be consistent with the anatomy of the eye. He was also an early proponent of the scientific method, the concept that a hypothesis must be proved by experiments based on confirmable procedures or mathematical evidence, five centuries before Renaissance scientists.

===Pharmacology===

Advances in botany and chemistry in the Islamic world encouraged developments in pharmacology. Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi (Rhazes) (865–915) promoted the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936–1013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His &quot;Liber servitoris&quot; provides instructions for preparing &quot;simples&quot; from which were compounded the complex drugs then used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (died 869) was the first physician to describe a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Muwaffaq, in the 10th century, wrote &quot;The foundations of the true properties of Remedies&quot;, describing chemicals such as arsenious oxide and silicic acid. He distinguished between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also of lead compounds. Al-Biruni (973–1050) wrote the &quot;Kitab al-Saydalah&quot; (&quot;The Book of Drugs&quot;), describing in detail the properties of drugs, the role of pharmacy and the duties of the pharmacist. Ibn Sina (Avicenna) described 700 preparations, their properties, their mode of action and their indications. He devoted a whole volume to simples in &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot;. Works by Masawaih al-Mardini ( 925–1015) and by Ibn al-Wafid (1008–1074) were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as &quot;De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus&quot; by Mesue the Younger (died 1015) and as the &quot;Medicamentis simplicibus&quot; by Abenguefit (c. 997 – 1074) respectively. Peter of Abano (1250–1316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Mardini under the title &quot;De Veneris&quot;. Ibn al-Baytar (1197–1248), in his &quot;Al-Jami fi al-Tibb&quot;, described a thousand simples and drugs based directly on Mediterranean plants collected along the entire coast between Syria and Spain, for the first time exceeding the coverage provided by Dioscorides in classical times. Islamic physicians such as Ibn Sina described clinical trials for determining the efficacy of medical drugs and substances.

===Physics===

The fields of physics studied in this period, apart from optics and astronomy which are described separately, are aspects of mechanics: statics, dynamics, kinematics and motion. In the sixth century John Philoponus () rejected the Aristotelian view of motion. He argued instead that an object acquires an inclination to move when it has a motive power impressed on it. In the eleventh century Ibn Sina adopted roughly the same idea, namely that a moving object has force which is dissipated by external agents like air resistance. Ibn Sina distinguished between &quot;force&quot; and &quot;inclination&quot; (&quot;mayl&quot;); he claimed that an object gained &quot;mayl&quot; when the object is in opposition to its natural motion. He concluded that continuation of motion depends on the inclination that is transferred to the object, and that the object remains in motion until the &quot;mayl&quot; is spent. He also claimed that a projectile in a vacuum would not stop unless it is acted upon. That view accords with Newton&#x27;s first law of motion, on inertia. As a non-Aristotelian suggestion, it was essentially abandoned until it was described as &quot;impetus&quot; by Jean Buridan (c. 1295–1363), who was likely influenced by Ibn Sina&#x27;s &quot;Book of Healing&quot;.

In the &quot;Shadows&quot;, Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī (973–1048) describes non-uniform motion as the result of acceleration. Ibn-Sina&#x27;s theory of &quot;mayl&quot; tried to relate the velocity and weight of a moving object, a precursor of the concept of momentum. Aristotle&#x27;s theory of motion stated that a constant force produces a uniform motion; Abu&#x27;l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī (c. 1080 – 1164/5) disagreed, arguing that velocity and acceleration are two different things, and that force is proportional to acceleration, not to velocity.

The Banu Musa brothers, Jafar-Muhammad, Ahmad and al-Hasan (c. early 9th century) invented automated devices described in their Book of Ingenious Devices. Advances on the subject were also made by al-Jazari and Ibn Ma&#x27;ruf.

===Zoology===

Many classical works, including those of Aristotle, were transmitted from Greek to Syriac, then to Arabic, then to Latin in the Middle Ages. Aristotle&#x27;s zoology remained dominant in its field for two thousand years. The &quot;Kitāb al-Hayawān&quot; (كتاب الحيوان, English: &quot;Book of Animals&quot;) is a 9th-century Arabic translation of &quot;History of Animals&quot;: 1–10, &quot;On the Parts of Animals&quot;: 11–14, and &quot;Generation of Animals&quot;: 15–19.

The book was mentioned by Al-Kindī (died 850), and commented on by Avicenna (Ibn Sīnā) in his &quot;The Book of Healing&quot;. Avempace (Ibn Bājja) and Averroes (Ibn Rushd) commented on and criticised &quot;On the Parts of Animals&quot; and &quot;Generation of Animals&quot;.

==Significance==
Muslim scientists helped in laying the foundations for an experimental science with their contributions to the scientific method and their empirical, experimental and quantitative approach to scientific inquiry. In a more general sense, the positive achievement of Islamic science was simply to flourish, for centuries, in a wide range of institutions from observatories to libraries, madrasas to hospitals and courts, both at the height of the Islamic golden age and for some centuries afterwards. It did not lead to a scientific revolution like that in Early modern Europe, but such external comparisons are probably to be rejected as imposing &quot;chronologically and culturally alien standards&quot; on a successful medieval culture.

<text>Tarbikha (), was a Palestinian Arab village. It was located northeast of Acre in the British Mandate District of Acre that was captured and depopulated by the Israel Defense Forces during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. The inhabitants of this village were, similar to the inhabitants of Southern Lebanon, Shia Muslims.

==History==
Three sarcophagi were found on the south side of the village. A semi-circular pool, cisterns and tombs were also found.

Tarbikha was located on the site of the Crusaders &quot;Tayerebika&quot;, from which it derived its name. In 1183 it was noted that &quot;Godfrey de Tor&quot; sold the land of the village to Joscelin III. In 1220 Jocelyn III&#x27;s daughter Beatrix de Courtenay and her husband Otto von Botenlauben, Count of Henneberg, sold their land, including &quot;Tayerbica&quot;, to the Teutonic Knights.

===Ottoman era===
Tarbikha was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with the rest of Palestine, and by 1596 it was part of the &quot;nahiya&quot; (subdistrict) of Tibnin under the Liwa of Safad, with a population of 88. It paid taxes on a number of crops, including wheat, olives and barley, as well as on goats, beehives and a press that was used for processing either olives or grapes.

In the late nineteenth century, the village of Tarbikha was described as being built of stone and situated on a ridge. The population was estimated at being around 100, and they lived by cultivating olives. During this period Tarbikha was a part of the Beirut province. Only after World War I, when the borders between Lebanon and Palestine were delineated by the British and French, did Tarbikha come under Palestinian administration.

===British Mandate era===

In the 1931 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, &quot;Tarbikha&quot; had a population of 674; 1 Christian and the rest Muslims, in a total of 149 houses.

The village had two mosques, and an elementary school, founded after 1938, which had an enrollment of 120 students in the mid-1940s. It also had a customs office and a police station for monitoring the Lebanese border.

In the 1945 statistics the village population was counted together with that of Suruh and Al-Nabi Rubin, together they had 1000 Muslim inhabitants and a total of 18,563 dunams of land. Of this, a total of 3,200 dunums allocated to cereals, while 619 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards, while 112 dunams were built-up (urban) area.

===1948 war and aftermath===
The town was assaulted during Operation Hiram by the Oded Brigade on 30 October 1948. The population was ordered to leave for Lebanon in early November. The military did not let the Arabs gather the crops they planted; rather the military allowed the Jews of the kibbutz Tarbikha to gather the crops and left the villages unguarded, which allowed any passerby access to the items in the unguarded village. The village lands of Tarbikha were settled by Jewish immigrants from Hungary and Romania as part of the policy of Judaisation of Northern Israel.

The Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, described the village remaining structures in 1992: &quot;About twenty houses from the village are now occupied by the residents of Moshav Shomera. Some of the roofs have been remodeled and given a gabled form. Stones from the original houses embellish the roof of the central shelter of the moshav.&quot;

In 1994, the refugees from the seven villages, who had been classified as Palestinian refugees since 1948, were granted Lebanese citizenship.

<text>Umm al-Faraj (, known to the Crusaders as La Fierge), was a Palestinian village, depopulated in 1948.

==Location==
The village was situated on a flat spot in the Acre plain, northeast of Acre.

==History==
Archaeological remains from the Roman and Byzantine eras have been found here.

Sugar Moulds found here indicate that sugar productions started in the 11th century, under the Fatimid era.

===Crusader/Mamluk era===
The village was known to the Crusaders as &quot;Le Fierge&quot;, and belonged to the fief of &quot;Casal Imbert&quot;. In 1253 King Henry granted the whole estate of Casal Imbert, including &quot;Le Fierge&quot;, to John of Ibelin. Shortly after, in 1256, John of Ibelin leased Az-Zeeb and all its depending villages (including &quot;Le Fierge&quot;) to the Teutonic Order for 10 years. In 1261, Az-Zeeb, together with &quot;Le Fierge&quot; and Le Quiebre, were sold to the Teutonic Order, in return for an annual sum for as long as Acre was in Christian hands. In 1283 it was still a part of the Crusader states, as it was mentioned as part of their domain in the hudna between the Crusaders based in Acre and the Mamluk sultan Qalawun.

According to al-Maqrizi, it had come under Mamluk rule in 1291, when it was mentioned under the name of &quot;Farah&quot; when sultan al-Ashraf Khalil allocated the village&#x27;s income to a Waqf in Cairo.

Sugar production continued here during the Crusader and Mamluk eras.

===Ottoman era===
Incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, it appeared in the 1596 tax registers as &quot;Farja&quot;, being in the Akka Nahiya (Subdistrict of Acre), part of the Safad Sanjak (District of Safed), with a population of 24 households and 13 bachelors, all Muslim. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 20% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, cotton, goats and beehives, in addition to &quot;occasional revenues&quot; and a water mill; a total of 1,576 akçe. Half of the revenues were given to a waqf. Sugar production continued here to the beginning of the seventeenth century CE.

In 1799, the village was called &quot;El Fargi&quot; on the map of Pierre Jacotin. An inscription in marble, built into the wall above the gate of the village mosque, dates this building to 1254 H, (1838-39 C.E.).

In May 1875, the French explorer Victor Guérin visited the village. He described it as being surrounded by &quot;delightful&quot; gardens, irrigated with water from Nahr al-Mafshukh. Many houses were built with great care, and some had old pieces of stone built into them. He further noted that &quot;the location of an old demolished church is still to a certain extent recognisable&quot;, and that all the 200 villagers were Muslim. In 1881, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described it as being built of stone and with a population of 200. The villagers planted fig, olive, mulberry and pomegranate trees.

A population list from about 1887 showed &quot;Um el Ferj&quot; to have about 690 inhabitants, all Muslims.

===British Mandate era===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities &quot;Umm al Faraj&quot; had a population of 322, all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 415, 2 Christians and 413 Muslims, in a total of 94 houses.
The older houses in the village were built close together and formed a circle, while the homes build after 1936 were scattered among the orchards. The population of Umm al-Faraj lived by agriculture.

In the 1945 statistics, the population of Umm al-Faraj was 800, all Muslims, with a total land area of 825 dunams. In 1944/45 a total of was used for citrus and bananas, were used for cereals, were irrigated or used for orchards, while 15 dunams were built-up (urban) areas.

===1948 War and aftermath===

During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Umm al-Faraj was assaulted by Israel&#x27;s Carmeli Brigade in the second stage of Operation Ben&#x27;Ami. The operational order, issued 19 May 1948, was to &quot;attack with the aim of conquest, the killing of adult males, destruction and torching.&quot; The assault came on the 20–21 May 1948, when Carmeli forces attacked Umm al-Faraj together with Kabri, al Tell and Nahar, and then &quot;demolished them,&quot; according to Morris.

Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel. The moshav of Ben Ami was established in 1949, in part on village land.

The Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi described the village remains in 1992: &quot;Only the stone mosque remains. It is shut and stands in a state of decay amid tall wild grass. Many trees that might predate the village&#x27;s destruction can be seen. The nearby lands are cultivated; a banana grove belongs to the Ben Ammi settlement.&quot;

<text>Carl Ferdinand Wilhelm Walther (October 25, 1811 – May 7, 1887) was a German-American Lutheran minister. He was the first president of the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod (LCMS) and its most influential theologian. He is commemorated by that church on its Calendar of Saints on May 7. He has been described as a man who gave up his homeland for the freedom to speak freely, to believe freely, and to live freely, by emigrating from Germany to the United States.

==Early life and education==
C. F. W. Walther was born a pastor&#x27;s son in Langenchursdorf in the Kingdom of Saxony (part of modern-day Germany). Out of a strong religious commitment, he immigrated to the United States in 1838, initially as a follower of Martin Stephan. On September 21, 1841, he married Emilie Buenger. They had six children. He started two important publications, and was author of many books and periodical articles. He was also the head pastor of the four Saxon Lutheran congregations (called the &quot;Gesammtgemeinde&quot;) in St. Louis (Trinity, Holy Cross, Immanuel, and Zion). In August 1855, Walther turned down an honorary doctorate from the University of Göttingen, but in 1877 he accepted a Doctor of Theology (Th.D.) degree from Capital University in Columbus, Ohio. He died in St. Louis on May 7, 1887, and was buried at Concordia Cemetery, where a mausoleum was later built in his honor.

Ferdinand, as he was called by his family, was first educated by his father. At the age of eight, he attended school in Hohenstein for two years. He then entered &quot;Latein Schule&quot; (&quot;Latin school&quot;, a college preparatory school) in Schneeberg, from which he graduated in September 1829.

One month later he enrolled in the University of Leipzig to begin his study of theology and joined his older brother Otto Hermann, who was enrolled in the same university. During his college years in Leipzig he contracted a near-fatal lung disease and had to interrupt his studies for six months. While ill and recuperating, he assiduously read the works of Martin Luther and became convinced that Luther&#x27;s theology clearly taught the doctrines of Holy Scripture. He also began believing in the importance of a firm confessional position.

In 1833, Walther took his first exam at the university. This examination allowed him to accept a position as a private tutor for a family in the town of Kahla. The experience of two years&#x27; tutoring qualified him to take his second examination in Leipzig and graduate. On January 15, 1837, he was ordained to the Lutheran clergy and became a pastor in the town of Bräunsdorf in Saxony. As part of his pastoral duties, he taught religion classes in the local school. He soon, however, found himself at odds with the rationalistic government of the Kingdom of Saxony because he believed that it had departed from the faith and practice of historic Lutheranism and promoted false doctrine. The lack of orthodoxy also caused many other conservative Lutherans to oppose the Saxon government&#x27;s liberal religious policies.

==Career==
===Exodus from Saxony===
Walther and several hundred of the other dissenters came together under the leadership of a pastor holding similar views—Martin Stephan from Dresden. In November 1838, under Stephan&#x27;s direction, 800 Saxon immigrants (&quot;Stephanites&quot;) left on five ships for America in what is known as the Saxon Lutheran Migration, hoping for the freedom to practice their religious beliefs. The settlers arrived in New Orleans on January 5, 1839. The group settled both in St. Louis, Missouri, and to the south along the Mississippi River in Perry County, Missouri.

=== Controversy over Bishop Stephan ===
Soon after the immigrants were settled in the new homeland, their leader and self-proclaimed &quot;bishop of the new settlement&quot;, Martin Stephan, was accused of financial and sexual misconduct (charges he had also faced in Saxony) and was expelled from the settlement. His departure left Walther as one of leading clergymen remaining.

=== The Altenburg Debate ===

After the fall of Stephan, the group of immigrants was deeply disturbed and unsure whether they were still a Lutheran congregation after having left the authorities and church hierarchy in Germany behind. Walther, who was originally called to be the pastor of a dual parish in the Perry County settlements of Dresden and Johannisberg, struggled over the questions that the laity and other pastors were also asking. In April 1841, soon after his brother Otto Herman, who was pastor of the congregation in St. Louis, had died, a public debate was held between Walther and attorney Marbach, one of the lay leaders of the settlers, in what is known as the &quot;Altenburg Debate&quot;. Walther convinced Marbach and most of the other colonists that they could validly consider themselves to be a church. He then accepted the call to his brother&#x27;s congregation in St. Louis, Trinity Lutheran Church, and served that congregation from May 1841 until his death.

=== Walther&#x27;s ministry ===
During his forty years of work in the LCMS, Walther held several key positions. A log cabin college, which Walther helped to found, opened in December 1839 in Altenburg and eventually developed into Concordia Seminary in St. Louis. Walther became its first president and held that position for the remainder of his life.

On April 26, 1847, the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod was founded. Walther served as its first president, a position he held from 1847 to 1850 and again from 1864 to 1878. In 1861, he also became president of the synod&#x27;s &quot;practical&quot; seminary (today&#x27;s Concordia Theological Seminary) while it was co-located with Concordia Seminary for several years.

He also founded and edited several Lutheran periodicals, including &quot;Der Lutheraner&quot; and &quot;Lehre und Wehre&quot;. He wrote a number of theological books. Perhaps his best known work is &quot;The Proper Distinction Between Law and Gospel&quot;, which is a transcription of a series of evening lectures he gave at the seminary. He is also the author of the text and tune of the hymn &quot;He&#x27;s Risen, He&#x27;s Risen&quot; () found in the hymnals of the LCMS and other Lutheran bodies.
Walther vigorously opposed the theologies of non-Lutheran denominations in America and the influence of the major secular philosophies and movements on Lutheran thought and practice, and defended the doctrinal and cultural heritage of the Lutheran Church.

==Works==

== Walther film ==

In 2011, in honor of the 200th anniversary of Walther&#x27;s birth, Concordia Seminary, St. Louis, Missouri, produced a video series (&quot;Walther&quot;) which followed the life of Dr. Walther, including the history of the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod. Concordia Seminary distributed the videos to LCMS congregations in October 2011. A study guide and Bible study materials also accompanied each segment of the video.

<text>Cruise control (also known as speed control, cruise command, autocruise, or tempomat) is a system that automatically controls the speed of an automobile. The system is a servomechanism that takes over the car&#x27;s throttle to maintain a steady speed set by the driver.

==History==


Speed control existed in early automobiles such as the Wilson-Pilcher in the early 1900s. They had a lever on the steering column that could be used to set the speed to be maintained by the engine. In 1908, the Peerless included a governor to keep the speed of the engine through an extra throttle lever on the steering wheel. Peerless successfully used a flyball governor. They advertised their system as being able to &quot;maintain speed whether uphill or down.&quot; 

A governor was used by James Watt and Matthew Boulton in 1788 to control steam engines, but the use of governors dates at least back to the 17th century. On an engine, the governor uses centrifugal force to adjust the throttle position to adapt the engine&#x27;s speed to different loads (e.g., when going up a hill).

Modern cruise control (also known as a speedostat or tempomat) was invented in 1948 by the blind inventor and mechanical engineer Ralph Teetor. He came up with the idea due to being frustrated by his driver&#x27;s habit of speeding up and slowing down as he talked. 

A more significant factor in developing cruise control was the speed limit imposed in the United States during World War II to reduce gasoline use and tire wear. A mechanism controlled by the driver provided resistance to further pressure on the accelerator pedal when the vehicle reached the desired speed. Teetor&#x27;s idea of a dashboard speed selector with a mechanism connected to the driveshaft and a device able to push against the gas pedal was patented in 1950. He added a speed lock capability that maintained the car&#x27;s speed until the driver tapped the brake pedal or turned off the system.

A 1955 U.S. patent for a &quot;constant speed regulator&quot; was filed in 1950 by M-Sgt Frank J. Riley. He conceived the device while driving on the Pennsylvania Turnpike and installed his invention in his car in 1948. 

Another inventor named Harold Exline, working independently of Riley, also invented a type of cruise control that he first installed on his car and friends&#x27; cars. Exline filed a U.S. patent for a &quot;vacuum powered throttle control with electrically controlled air valve&quot; in 1951, which was granted in 1956. Despite these patents, Riley, Exline, and subsequent patent holders were not able to collect royalties for any cruise control inventions.

The first car with Teetor&#x27;s &quot;speedostat&quot; system was the 1958 Chrysler Imperial (called &quot;auto-pilot&quot;), using a speed control dial on the dashboard. This system calculated ground speed from the rotating speedometer cable and used a bi-directional screw-drive electric motor to vary the throttle position as needed. Cadillac soon renamed and marketed the device as &quot;cruise control.&quot; 

In 1965, American Motors Corporation (AMC) introduced a low-priced automatic speed control for its large-sized cars with automatic transmissions. The AMC &quot;cruise command&quot; unit was actuated through a push-button on the dashboard once the car&#x27;s desired speed was reached. The throttle position was automatically adjusted by a vacuum control that opened and closed the throttle based on input from the speedometer cable rather than through an adjustable control on the dashboard. The unit would shut off anytime the brakes were applied.

Daniel Aaron Wisner invented an &quot;automotive electronic cruise control&quot; in 1968 as an engineer for RCA&#x27;s Industrial and Automation Systems Division in Plymouth, Michigan. His invention is described in two patents filed that year (US patents 3570622 and 3511329), with the second introducing digital memory, and was the first electronic device that controlled a car.

Due to the 1973 oil crisis and rising fuel prices, the device became more popular in the U.S. &quot;Cruise control can save gas by avoiding surges that expel fuel&quot; while driving at steady speeds. In 1974, AMC, GM, and Chrysler priced the option at $60 to $70, while Ford charged $103.

In the late 1980s, an integrated circuit for Wisner&#x27;s design for electronic cruise control was finally commercially developed by Motorola as the MC14460 Automotive Speed Control Processor in CMOS. The advantage of electronic speed control over its mechanical predecessor was that it could be integrated with electronic accident avoidance and engine management systems.

==Operation==

The driver must manually bring the vehicle up to speed and use a button to set the cruise control to the current speed.

The cruise control takes its speed signal from a rotating driveshaft, speedometer cable, wheel speed sensor from the engine&#x27;s RPM, or internal speed pulses produced electronically by the vehicle. Most systems do not allow the use of the cruise control below a certain speed - typically around . The vehicle will maintain the desired speed by pulling the throttle cable with a solenoid, a vacuum-driven servomechanism, or by using the electronic systems built into the vehicle (fully electronic) if it uses a &#x27;drive-by-wire&#x27; system.

All cruise control systems must have the capability to be turned off explicitly and automatically when the driver depresses the brake pedal and often also the clutch. Cruise control systems frequently include a memory feature to resume the set speed after braking and a coast feature to reduce the set speed without braking. When the cruise control is engaged, the throttle can still accelerate the car, but once the pedal is released, it will slow down the vehicle until it reaches the previously set speed.

On the latest vehicles fitted with electronic throttle control, cruise control can be integrated into the vehicle&#x27;s engine management system. Modern &quot;adaptive&quot; systems include the ability to automatically reduce speed when the distance to a car in front, or the speed limit, decreases. 

The cruise control systems of some vehicles incorporate a &quot;speed limiter&quot; function, which will not allow the vehicle to accelerate beyond a preset maximum; this can usually be overridden by fully depressing the accelerator pedal. Most systems will prevent the vehicle from increasing engine speed to accelerate beyond the chosen speed. However, they will not apply the brakes in the event of overspeeding downhill, nor stop the car from going faster than the selected speed even with the engine just idling.

Cruise control is less flexible on vehicles with a manual transmission because depressing the clutch pedal and shifting gears usually disengages the cruise control. The &quot;resume&quot; feature has to be used each time after selecting the new gear and releasing the clutch. Therefore, cruise control is most beneficial at motorway/highway speeds when top gear is used virtually all the time. The speed limiter function, however, does not have this problem.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Some advantages of cruise control include:
* It is helpful for long drives along highways and sparsely populated roads by reducing driver fatigue and improving comfort by allowing positioning changes more safely.
* Some drivers use it to avoid speeding, particularly those who may subconsciously increase speed during a long highway journey.
* Increased fuel efficiency

However, when misused, cruise control can lead to accidents due to several factors, such as:
* hazardous weather conditions. The U.S. state of Michigan warns against using cruise control if the road has ice or snow, while the Canadian province of British Columbia recommends not using cruise control on wet roads. When a car skids with cruise control enabled, the vehicle will keep accelerating, increasing the chance of losing control. If the vehicle is sliding on ice, the driver should not brake or accelerate, but just let the vehicle slow down on its own.
* speeding around curves that require slowing down
* rough or loose terrain that could negatively affect the cruise control controls
* Encourages drivers to pay less attention to driving, increasing the risk of an accident
* Risk of sudden unintended acceleration (SUA) and possible accidents. Drivers with feet at rest lose spatial perception and may hit the accelerator instead of the brake pedal in a sudden emergency.

==Adaptive cruise control==

Some modern vehicles have adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems, a general term meaning improved cruise control. Dynamic set speed systems use the GPS position of speed limit signs from a database. Many systems also incorporate cameras, lasers, and millimeter-wave radar equipment to determine how close a vehicle is to others or other objects on the roadway.

The technologies can be set to maintain a distance from vehicles in front of the car; the system will automatically slow down based on the vehicles in front or continue to keep the set speed. Some systems cannot detect completely stationary cars or pedestrians, so the driver must always pay attention. Automatic braking systems use either a single or a combination of sensors (radar, lidar, and camera) to allow the vehicle to keep pace with the car it is following, slow when closing in on the vehicle in front, and accelerate to the preset speed when traffic allows. Some systems also feature forward collision warning systems, which warn the driver if a vehicle in front—given the speed of both vehicles—gets too close within the preset headway or braking distance. 

Vehicles with adaptive cruise control are considered a Level 1 autonomous car, as defined by SAE International.

<doc id="267561" wikidata="Q1711521" url="?curid=267561" title="Nazca">
<text>Nazca (; sometimes spelled Nasca; possibly from ) is a city and system of valleys on the southern coast of Peru. The city of Nazca is the largest in the Nazca Province. The name is derived from the Nazca culture, which flourished in the area between 100 BC and AD 800. This culture was responsible for the Nazca Lines and the ceremonial city of Cahuachi. They also constructed additional underground aqueducts, named puquios, in a regional system that still functions today. The first puquios are believed to have been built by the preceding Paracas culture.

Nazca is the capital of the Nazca Province located in the Ica District of the Ica Region of Peru.

== Earthquake ==

On November 12, 1996, at 11:59 a.m. local time (16:59 GMT) there was an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 with its epicenter at 7.7 km into the sea. The earthquake almost completely destroyed the city of Nazca and its surroundings. Due to its occurrence during the day, there were only 14 fatalities. However, 1,500 people were injured and around 100,000 were left homeless. Within 12 years Nazca has been almost completely rebuilt.

Since 1997, Nazca has been the location of a major Canadian gold mining operation. The indigenous people at the time did not own the rights to their traditional communal lands. As a result, they were forcibly displaced. Since then, they have sought to legalize their ancient ownership of land and fixed property.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Nazca is one of the most arid regions in the world, with an average annual precipitation of 4 millimeters. Nazca&#x27;s weather is controlled by the Humboldt Current, which carries water from Antarctica up the west coast of South America.

This cold ocean water cools the air and limits the accumulation of moisture within clouds; as a result, though clouds and fog are able to form, there is little rain.

Nazca&#x27;s temperatures range from 10 to 32 °C with an average daily high of 21 °C. Summer months from November to March are dry, sunny, and hot. During the winter from June to August, fog from the coast rolls over the hills to keep temperatures in the moderate range; however, the intense sun makes daylight hours seem hotter than they are.

==History==

There are two versions of the Spanish foundation. According to the writings of chroniclers, the city was founded on October 28, 1548, commissioned by Pedro de la Gasca, peacemaker by Alonso de Mendoza. The other version states that it was founded in 1591 by the Viceroy García Hurtado de Mendoza, 5th Marquis of Cañete.

During the Spanish colonial period, Nazca was known for viticulture, producing wine and grape brandy (aguardiente de la uva). Today this is commonly called pisco, after the famous port of the same name. Locally, the brandy is known as Nasca. These products were widely distributed throughout the viceroyalty of Peru and beyond.

The largest of the Nazca vineyards were located in the rich Ingenio Valley, and were property of the Society of Jesus, Jesuit missionaries and priests. The hacienda San Joseph de la Nasca, located in the upper part of the middle Ingenio Valley, was owned by the Jesuit College of Cuzco. San Francisco Xavier de la Nasca, in the lower part of the middle valley, was owned by the Jesuit College of San Pablo in Lima. Both of these estates used numerous workers who were enslaved persons of sub-Saharan African descent. In addition to producing wines and brandies, both estates had substantial infrastructure for producing the ceramic storage jars, known as &quot;botijas,&quot; in which the wine and brandy was transported.

Today, the towns of San Javier and San José are known for the ruins of the large 18th-century baroque churches built during the Jesuit administration of these estates. In 1767, following the expulsion of the Society of Jesus by King Charles III of Spain, the Crown confiscated and administered these properties as royal estates.
Nazca Patriots received the Liberating Expedition of General Don Jose de San Martin on October 14, 1820, after they escaped from the Battle of Nasca. Two days earlier, on October 12, General Juan Antonio Álvarez de Arenales, from Ica, was sent to the South in pursuit of the royal troops of Colonel Manuel Quimper fleeing from Ica. The second commander and chief of staff of the Division de la Sierra, was Argentine Lieutenant Colonel Manuel Rojas Argerich. He commanded 250 men: 110 infantry and 140 cavalry.

The town of Nasca was established on August 29, 1821. On July 2, 1855, it was elevated to a district and then it became a province on January 23, 1941.

Nasca, as the name is spelled in the 21st century, still has a dry climate. Before and during the time of the Inca, it had a formidable system of hydraulic engineering. The water was accessed through filtration galleries from underground branches, called aqueducts. The openings to the system were called puquios. More than three dozen continue to operate, to irrigate farmland and provide domestic needs.

==Nazca lines==

The Nazca culture is famous for its desert line drawings, the product of complex construction projects carried out by a hierarchical society from 500 BC to AD 500. Contrary to the popular belief that the lines and figures can be seen only from an aircraft, they are also visible from the surrounding foothills and other high places. There are innumerable formations of both animals and geometric designs.

Local tour companies sell flights (&quot;sobrevueltos&quot;) over 12 main figures, the most famous of which are the hummingbird, the condor, and the monkey. The spiral tail of the monkey inspired the spiral in the &quot;P&quot; of the Perú logo, which is also found on its currency. UNESCO declared the Nazca Lines a World Heritage Site in 1994.

==Airport==
Nazca has a small airport, the Maria Reiche Neuman Airport, used mainly for touristic flights over the Nazca lines. It was named for a woman who did much to study the Nazca lines and bring them to international attention as products of pre-Hispanic man.

<text>Operation Hiram was a military operation conducted by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. It was led by General Moshe Carmel, and aimed at capturing the Upper Galilee region from the Arab Liberation Army (ALA) forces led by Fawzi al-Qawuqji and a Syrian battalion. The operation, which lasted 60 hours (29–31 October), ended just before the ceasefire with the neighboring Arab countries went into effect.

As a result of the operation, the Upper Galilee, originally slated by the United Nations partition plan to be part of an Arab state, would be controlled by the newly formed state of Israel, and more than 50,000 new Palestinian refugees were expelled from their homes.

==Overview==

On 18 July, the second truce of the conflict went into effect. On 26 September 1948, David Ben-Gurion told his cabinet that if fighting should be renewed in the north, then the Galilee would become &quot;clean&quot; [&quot;naki&quot;] and &quot;empty&quot; [&quot;reik&quot;] of Arabs, and implied that he had been assured of this by his generals.
Before dawn on 22 October ALA violated the truce when it stormed the IDF hilltop position of Sheikh Abd, overlooking kibbutz Manara from the north. During 24–25 October, ALA troops regularly sniped at Manara and at traffic along the main road. Fawzi al-Qawuqji demanded that Israel evacuate neighboring kibbutz Yiftah and thin out its forces in Manara. Israel, in turn, demanded the ALA’s withdrawal from the captured positions and, after a &quot;no&quot; from Qawuqji, informed the United Nations that it felt free to do as it pleased.

The operation was launched on the night of 28–29 October 1948, fielding four IDF brigades, the Seventh, Carmeli Brigade, Golani, and the Oded Brigade. The operational order was &quot;to destroy the enemy in the central Galilee &quot;pocket&quot;, to occupy the whole of the Galilee and to establish the defense line on the country´s northern border.&quot; On 29 October, Yosef Weitz, learning about the start of the operation, sent Yigael Yadin a note urging that the army should expel the &quot;refugees&quot; from the newly conquered areas.

The Ground offensive was preceded by bombing raids targeting Tarshiha, Jish and Sa&#x27;sa from 22 October, using Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses and Douglas C-47 Skytrains (converted for bombing role). The heaviest night of bombing was 29/30 October when 13 missions dropped 21 tons of bombs on the seven villages. The bombardment of Tarshiha triggered the mass flight after 24 of the inhabitants were killed and approximately 60 were buried under rubble.

The initial thrust was carried out by the Seventh Brigade advancing from Safad. The Seventh Brigade occupied Qaddita on 29 October, Meirun and then Safsaf and Jish. In the 79th Battalion&#x27;s report, the battles for Safsaf and Jish were described as &quot;difficult&quot; and &quot;cruel&quot; (&quot;achzari&quot;). One IDF report said &quot;150–200&quot; Arabs, &quot;including a number of civilians&quot; died in the battle for Jish. Other accounts report that 200 bodies were found around Jish and 80 at Meirum.

From Jish, the 72nd and 79th battalions then turned west to take Sa&#x27;sa. After taking Sa&#x27;sa the Israeli forces then turned northwest taking Kfar Birem, Saliha and by the afternoon of 30 October were at al Malikiya.

Simultaneously, the Golani Brigade engaged in diversionary tactics in the direction of the village of Illaboun. The Carmeli Brigade, which was assigned to counter attacks from Syria and Lebanon, crossed the border into Lebanon, captured 15 villages, and reached the Litani River. General Carmel had received direct permission from Prime Minister Ben-Gurion to enter Lebanon, but only as far as the river. In the final hours of the offensive Carmel&#x27;s second-in-command, General Makleff, met Ben-Gurion in Tiberias and requested permission to advance and occupy Beirut which he claimed could be reached in twelve hours. Fearing international condemnation, Ben-Gurion refrained from taking action, as Lebanon was neutral in the conflict.

Ceasefire was scheduled to commence at 11:00 hours, 31 October 1948. The same day, at 7:30 in the morning, Major General Moshe Carmel ordered his brigades and district commanders &quot;to continue the clearing operations inside the Galilee&quot;. In a cable dated 10:00 hours the same day Carmel ordered his brigades and district commanders: &quot;Do all in your power for a quick and immediate clearing [&quot;tihur&quot;] of the conquered areas of all the hostile elements in line with the orders that have been issued[.] The inhabitants of the areas conquered should be assisted to leave.&quot; This order was apparently issued after Carmel had met with Ben-Gurion the same day.

On 31 October and 1 November 1948 the Hula massacre took place at the Lebanese village of Hula (Hule). The village had been captured on 24 October by the Carmeli Brigade without any resistance at all. Between 35 and 58 captured men were reportedly shot down in a house which was later blown up on top of them.

At the end of this lightning attack, Israeli forces reached the Hiram Junction, north of Safed. The siege of Manara was lifted, Qawuqji&#x27;s army fled to Lebanon, and the roads crossing the Upper Galilee were secured. With the Galilee under Israeli control, the IDF established a defensive line along the Litani before withdrawing to the Lebanese border under the terms of the 1949 Armistice Agreements.

The Israeli Air Force bombings caused considerable damage to the villages in the area. Ilan Pappe gives the example of the four villages: Rama, Suhmata, Malkiyya and Kfar Bir&#x27;im. He states that out of the four &#x27;the only village to remain intact was Rama. The other three were occupied and destroyed&#x27;. Very few villagers were allowed to stay in their homes and many were imprisoned or expelled to Lebanon and elsewhere. Ilan Pappe claims that the &#x27;Hebrew noun tihur (cleansing) assumed new meanings&#x27; during this time period. He argues that although &#x27;it still described, as before, the total expulsion and destruction of a village, it could now also represent other activities, such as selective search and expulsion operations&#x27;.

One Israeli estimate gives a total of 400 Arabs killed during the offensive and 550 taken prisoner.

The name is a reference to Hiram I, the Biblical king of Tyre. He was instrumental in the construction of the First Temple of Jerusalem.

== Massacres ==
According to Israeli historian Benny Morris, the atrocities committed during Operation Hiram clearly embarrassed the IDF and Israeli officials who were soon forced to respond to Arab and United Nations charges in various forums. The main official Israeli response was a flat or qualified denial that atrocities had taken place.

<doc id="267573" wikidata="Q289416" url="?curid=267573" title="Étienne Brûlé">
<text>Étienne Brûlé (; – c. June 1633) was the first European explorer to journey beyond the St. Lawrence River into what is now known as Canada. He spent much of his early adult life among the Wendat (Huron), and mastered their language and learned their culture. Brûlé became an interpreter and guide for Samuel de Champlain, who later sent Brûlé on a number of exploratory missions, among which he is thought to have preceded Champlain to the Great Lakes, reuniting with him upon Champlain&#x27;s first arrival at Lake Huron. Among his many travels were explorations of Georgian Bay and Lake Huron, as well as the Humber and Ottawa Rivers. Champlain agreed to send Brûlé, at his own request, as an interpreter to live among the Onontchataron, an Algonquin people, in 1610. In 1629, during the Anglo-French War, he escaped after being captured by the Seneca tribe. Brûlé was killed and eaten by the Wendat Bear tribe, who believed he had betrayed them to the Seneca.

==Early life in France==

Brûlé, the son of Spire Bruslé and Marguerite Guérin, was born in Champigny-sur-Marne southeast of Paris. Brûlé&#x27;s exact date of birth is unknown since the Champigny-sur-Marne parish registers for 1590–1600 have been lost. He came to Canada in 1608 when he was 16 years old. Brûlé has not left any recollection or description of his early life, his time among the Indigenous peoples, or of his explorations. His life, therefore, has only been viewed through the works of others, including Champlain, Gabriel Sagard, and Jean de Brébeuf.

==Life in New France==
Champlain wrote of a youth who had been living in New France since 1608, and whom many believe to have been young Brûlé. In June 1610, Brûlé told Champlain that he wished to go and live with the Algonquins, learn their language, and better understand their customs and habits. Champlain arranged for him to do so and in return, the chief Iroquet (an Algonquin leader of the Petite nation who wintered his people near Huronia), requested that Champlain take Savignon, a young Wendat, with him to teach him the customs and habits of the French. Champlain instructed Brûlé to learn the Wendat (Huron) language, explore the country, establish good relations with the First Nations, and report back in one year&#x27;s time. On 13 June 1611, Champlain returned to visit Brûlé, who astonishingly had done all that Champlain had asked of him. Brûlé now dressed like an Indigenous person and was extremely pleased with the way he was treated and all that he had learned. Champlain requested that Brûlé continue to live among the Indigenous peoples so that he could fully master everything, and Brûlé agreed.

For four years, Champlain had had no connection or communication with Brûlé who, it is thought, was then the first European to see the Great Lakes. In 1615, they met again at Huronia. There, Brûlé informed Champlain of his adventures and explorations through North America. Brûlé explained that he was joined by another French interpreter by the name of Grenolle. He reported that they had traveled along the north shore of what they called &quot;la mer douce&quot; (the freshwater sea), now known as Lake Huron, and went as far as the great rapids of Sault Ste. Marie where Lake Superior enters Lake Huron.

In 1615, Brûlé asked permission from Champlain to join 12 Wendat warriors on their mission to see a nation referred to as Carantouan (who may or may not have been the Andaste Susquehannock people), allies of the Wendat, to ask them for their support during an expedition Champlain was planning. Champlain ordered the party to travel west of the Seneca country because they needed to arrive there quickly and the only way to do so was by crossing over enemy territory. This proved dangerous, but Brûlé did reach Carantouan; however, he arrived at the meeting place Champlain chose two days too late to assist Champlain and the Wendat, who had been defeated by the Iroquois.

Brûlé probably visited four of the five Great Lakes — Lake Huron, Lake Superior, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario—and may have also seen Lake Michigan. Brûlé was more than likely the first European to complete these expeditions across North America. In these expeditions he visited places such as the Ottawa River, Mattawa River, Lake Nipissing, and the French River to Georgian Bay. From Georgian Bay, Brûlé was able to cut into Lake Huron. He paddled up the St. Marys River and portaged into Lake Superior. He journeyed through Lake Simcoe and portaged through what is now Toronto to Lake Ontario. From Lake Ontario Brûlé was able to travel in Upstate New York and explore Pennsylvania and cross down the Susquehanna River to Chesapeake Bay. It is also said that it is very probable that Brûlé was one of the first Europeans to stand along the shores of Lake Erie and Lake Michigan. He had spent months visiting indigenous peoples that lived along Lake Erie between the Niagara and Detroit Rivers, but because he left no writings of his own, almost nothing identifiable is known about the tribes he visited, many of which would be obliterated a few decades later in the Beaver Wars (in contrast, Joseph de La Roche Daillon, who conducted a missionary journey among the tribes of Western New York in 1627, kept meticulous notes of his journeys; it is de La Roche&#x27;s writings that serve as the primary history of pre-Beaver Wars native occupation of Western New York).

Champlain and the Jesuits often spoke out against Brûlé&#x27;s adoption of Wendat customs, as well as his association with the fur traders, who were beyond the control of the colonial government. Brûlé returned to Quebec in 1618, but Champlain advised him to continue his explorations among the Wendat. Brûlé was later confined in Quebec for a year, where he taught the Jesuits Wendat. In 1626 Brûlé returned to France, where he worked as a merchant, and in 1626 or 1627 he married Alizon Coiffier. In April 1628, Brûlé and his French fleet were captured by the British off Anticosti Island and Brûlé was brought to London before being released and returned to New France where, &quot;pledging support to the Kirkes, he resumed his life among the Wendat and his trading activities.&quot;

In 1629, Brûlé betrayed the colony of New France. David Kirke and his brothers, English merchants of Huguenot extraction, paid 100 pistoles to Brûlé and three of his companions to pilot their ships up the St. Lawrence river and &quot;undoubtedly gave information as to the desperate state of Quebec&#x27;s garrison&quot; that emboldened the Kirkes to attack it. In his last accounts, Samuel Champlain &quot;accused Brûlé of treason because the latter agreed to do business with the Kirke brothers when they took Quebec for England in 1629.&quot; After 1629, Brûlé continued to live with the Indigenous peoples, acting as an interpreter in their dealings with the French traders.

==Death==
In 1633, Brûlé died at Toanché, on the Penetanguishene peninsula, however the actual events surrounding his death remain unclear. The rumours of his death first reached Quebec through second and third party accounts largely by the Algonquins, who at the time, were believed to be in a trading dispute with the Wendat.

One theory is that he was captured by the Seneca Iroquois in battle. Though he managed to escape, when he returned to his home among the Wendat, they did not believe his story. Suspecting him of trading with the Senecas, they stabbed Brûlé to death—his body dismembered and eaten by the villagers. However, contrary to this theory, there is no ethnographic evidence that the Wendat practiced cannibalism. Additionally, Jean de Brébeuf, who arrived in the region shortly after Brûlé&#x27;s death, described his murder as treacherous, but made no mention of cannibalism. One explanation is that the Wendat were misinterpreted—using the term &quot;eaten&quot; to describe that Brûlé was thrown from his high position. In this sense, &quot;eaten&quot; had previously been used by Wendat to describe deposed chieftains.

Brûlé&#x27;s murder also appears to have been controversial among the Wendat. In the immediate aftermath of his death, Toanché was abandoned and subsequently Wenrio and Ihonatiria were founded—suggesting a schism formed in the clan between those who supported Brûlé&#x27;s murder and those that didn&#x27;t.

To further complicate the matter, Father Le Jeune wrote in his 1633 journal in Jesuit Relations that on the last day of June, 1633 he met a French Interpreter among an envoy of Wendat who had lived with them for many years. It is unknown whom else Le Jeune could be referring to other than Brûlé, despite reports that Brûlé was already dead.

<text>The Barton Springs salamander (Eurycea sosorum) is an endangered lungless salamander. It is endemic to Texas, United States. It was first found in Barton Springs in Austin, but is now also known from other localities in the nearby Travis and Hays Counties. Barton Springs is located within Zilker Park which is situated in the Edwards Aquifer in Austin, Texas. Eliza Springs, located within Barton Springs, has one of the largest populations of Barton Springs salamanders.

== Habitat ==
The Barton Springs salamander prefers clear water and are typically found near openings of springs. These salamanders can also be found under rocks or gravel, within aquatic vegetation, and algae. Barton Springs salamanders can live in water depths ranging from . The springs in which these salamanders inhabit flow year-round and retain a constant temperature of around .

== Description ==
Barton Springs salamanders grow to approximately in total length and have mottled coloration varying from darkish purple to light yellow on their dorsal side. The variation in coloring is largely due to the presence or lack of melanophores, iridophores, and pigment gaps. The ventral side of the salamander is either a cream or translucent color which allows stomach contents and the presence of eggs to be visible. The ventral side of the tail has a yellow-orange stripe that extends from the cloaca to the end of the tail. They have a fairly small head with reduced eyes and a slender body with elongated limbs that indicate it occupies a semi-subterranean lifestyle. On either side of the salamander are three red gills with four fingers on the forelimbs and five toes on the hindlimbs. The Barton Springs salamander is an ectothermic species and displays bilateral symmetry.

== Reproduction ==
Barton Springs salamanders are dioecious, and females can hold up to 40 eggs at a time. The eggs are about 1.5 mm in diameter, surrounded by a jelly-like layer, and are deposited in a cluster on various substrates year-round. In captivity, Barton Springs salamanders display a tail-straddling walk during reproduction. Spermatophores deposited by males on substrate are stored by the female in a spermatheca. The fertilization of their eggs is consistent with most salamanders, which utilize internal fertilization in which sperm are released onto the eggs as they pass through the female reproductive tract.

==Environmental impact==
Amphibian species worldwide have been in decline due to climate change including but not limited to: increased UV radiation, change in precipitation, and various pathogen outbreaks (chytrid fungus which causes Chytridiomycosis). However, habitat destruction, degradation, and pollution on a local scale have resulted mainly from land and urbanization near the Barton Creek watershed. Due to the species having a small population and the degradation of its habitat, the Barton Springs salamander is vulnerable to extinction. In addition, aquatic vegetation has been shown to be a critical component to the salamander&#x27;s habitat; their numbers dropped precipitously after the removal of much of the vegetation from Barton Springs and have recovered after habitat restoration programs were implemented. These changes, in turn, affect, among others, water quality/quantity and biological community composition of rivers and water systems in the surrounding environment. The Texas Water Commission has also indicated that the Barton Springs aquifer is the most vulnerable to pollution within the state of Texas. The wide effects of contamination and degradation on these water systems make analyzing their specific sources difficult since the interactions of factors and overlapping effects may occur. Nonetheless, it is important to study these consequences so that future impact on this and other species may be reduced.

===Oxygen absorption===
Dissolved oxygen (DO) is required at specific levels to maintain healthy aquatic life. To do this, &quot;national ambient water quality criteria&quot; have been set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and measurements have been made since 1969, albeit inconsistently. Hypoxia, a state of reduced oxygen, may hinder embryonic and fetal development as well as decrease oxygen consumption in adults. Apart from prenatal developments, physiological responses may also arise from a lack of oxygen. Some of the known responses include &quot;Increases in heart rate and buccal pumping, behavioral hypothermia, and gill hypertrophy&quot;.

Since this species is an obligate aquatic neotene that retains its gills through its adult life, it must absorb oxygen through its gills or skin. However, the method in which it performs this absorption has yet to be determined. One study found that when presented with a low DO level, this salamander increases its body movement. They theorized two explanations for this reaction:
# low and high DO levels may be found relatively close, therefore movement will allow this species to migrate to a higher DO environment,
# the physical movement causes a decrease between boundary layers adjacent to skin and gills, which allows for greater flow of oxygen.

==Diet and behavior==
Much of the Barton Springs salamander&#x27;s life history remains unknown at this time. These salamanders are neotenic and strictly an aquatic species. This species of salamanders typically inhabits surface waters but are also suited to live in subterranean waters when conditions are not suitable at the surface. Barton Springs salamanders utilize innate predator recognition and are opportunistic feeders. It appears that they feed primarily on small aquatic crustaceans and planarian flatworms (&quot;Dugesia sp&quot;.), but can supplement their diet with other items, such as earthworms, snails, leeches, and insect larvae.

==Etymology==
The species epithet (&quot;sosorum&quot;) is an acronym for &quot;Save Our Springs Ordinance&quot; (of the City of Austin) although it is widely if erroneously believed to refer to SOS Alliance, a local preservation group combined with a Latin genitive plural ending.

==Conservation status==

Despite inhabiting an urban area, &quot;E. sosorum&quot; was not described until 1993. It was put on the federal List of Threatened and Endangered Species in 1997 and was last assessed in 2004 by the IUCN Red List. Under the IUCN Red List, the Barton Springs salamander is listed as vulnerable while in federally and within the state of Texas the species is considered endangered. The salamander&#x27;s listing prevented the City of Austin from cleaning the Barton Springs Pool as it had for 70 years—with bleach. As a result, the City of Austin applied for and was issued an Incidental Take Permit under Section 10(a)(1)(b) of the Endangered Species Act by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1998. The permit has a term of 15 years and allows incidental taking of salamanders during pool cleaning and maintenance. In addition, various conservation measures have been developed under the &quot;Barton Springs Salamander Conservation and Agreement Strategy&quot; which was signed in August 1996. A captive breeding program was also developed for this species as a way to increase the size of the current population. As a mitigation measure, the City offered to direct 10% of revenue generated through pool entry fees into a conservation fund that is used for research and habitat enhancement. Looking forward, the city of Austin has created an advisory team that will continue to review pool maintenance procedures in the salamander&#x27;s habitat and conduct monthly surveys to assess population size.

<text>The Arkansas River is a major tributary of the Mississippi River. It generally flows to the east and southeast as it traverses the U.S. states of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. The river&#x27;s source basin lies in Colorado, specifically the Arkansas River Valley. The headwaters derive from the snowpack in the Sawatch and Mosquito mountain ranges. It flows east into Kansas and finally through Oklahoma and Arkansas, where it meets the Mississippi River.

At , it is the sixth-longest river in the United States, the second-longest tributary in the Mississippi–Missouri system, and the 47th longest river in the world. Its origin is in the Rocky Mountains in Lake County, Colorado, near Leadville. In 1859, placer gold discovered in the Leadville area brought thousands seeking to strike it rich, but the easily recovered placer gold was quickly exhausted. The Arkansas River&#x27;s mouth is at Napoleon, Arkansas, and its drainage basin covers nearly . Its volume is much smaller than the Missouri and Ohio rivers, with a mean discharge of about .

The Arkansas from its headwaters to the 100th meridian west formed part of the U.S.–Mexico border from the Adams–Onís Treaty (in force 1821) until the Texas Annexation or Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.

==Pronunciations==
The river is alternatively pronounced or .

==Physical geography==
===Course changes===
The path of the Arkansas River has changed over time. Sediments from the river found in a palaeochannel next to Nolan, a site in the Tensas Basin, show that part of the river&#x27;s meander belt flowed through that area up to 3200 BCE. While it was previously thought that this relict channel was active at the same time as another relict of the Mississippi River&#x27;s meander belt, it has been shown that this channel of the Arkansas was inactive approximately 400 years before the Mississippi channel was active.

===Hydrography===

The Arkansas has three distinct sections in its long path through central North America. At its headwaters beginning near Leadville, Colorado, the Arkansas runs as a steep fast-flowing mountain river through the Rockies in its narrow valley, dropping in . This section supports extensive whitewater rafting, including The Numbers (near Granite, Colorado), Brown&#x27;s Canyon, and the Royal Gorge.

At Cañon City, Colorado, the Arkansas River valley widens and flattens markedly. Just west of Pueblo, Colorado, the river enters the Great Plains. Through the rest of Colorado, Kansas, and much of Oklahoma, it is a typical Great Plains riverway, with wide, shallow banks subject to seasonal flooding and periods of dwindling flow. Tributaries include the Cimarron and the Salt Fork Arkansas rivers.

In eastern Oklahoma, the river begins to widen further into a more contained consistent channel. To maintain more reliable flow rates, a series of dams and large reservoir lakes have been built on the Arkansas and its intersecting tributaries, including the Canadian, Verdigris, Neosho (Grand), Illinois, and Poteau rivers. These locks and dams enable the river to be navigable by barges and large river craft downriver of Muskogee, Oklahoma, where the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System joins the Verdigris River.

Into western Arkansas, the river path works between the encroaching Boston and Ouachita mountains, including many isolated, flat-topped mesas, buttes, or monadnocks such as Mount Nebo, Petit Jean Mountain, and Mount Magazine, the highest point in the state. The river valley expands as it encounters much flatter land beginning just west of Little Rock, Arkansas. It continues eastward across the plains and forests of eastern Arkansas until it flows into the Mississippi River near Napoleon, Arkansas.

Water flow in the Arkansas River (as measured in central Kansas) has dropped from approximately average from 1944–1963 to average from 1984–2003, largely because of the pumping of groundwater for irrigation in eastern Colorado and western Kansas.

Important cities along the Arkansas River include Canon City, Pueblo, La Junta, and Lamar, Colorado; Garden City, Dodge City, Hutchinson, and Wichita, Kansas; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and Fort Smith and Little Rock, Arkansas.

The May 2002 I-40 bridge disaster took place on I-40&#x27;s crossing of Kerr Reservoir on the Arkansas River near Webbers Falls, Oklahoma.

==Allocation problems==

Since 1902, Kansas has claimed that Colorado takes too much of the river&#x27;s water; it has filed numerous lawsuits over this issue in the U.S. Supreme Court that continue to this day, generally under the name of &quot;Kansas v. Colorado&quot;. The problems over the possession and use of Arkansas River water by Colorado and Kansas led to the creation of an interstate compact or agreement between the two states. While Congress approved the Arkansas River Compact in 1949, the compact did not stop further disputes by the two states over water rights to the river.

The Kansas–Oklahoma Arkansas River Basin Compact was created in 1965 to promote mutual consideration and equity over water use in the basin shared by those states. The Kansas–Oklahoma Arkansas River Commission was established, charged with administering the compact and reducing pollution. The compact was approved and implemented by both states in 1970 and has been in force since then.

==Riverway commerce==

The McClellan–Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System begins at the Tulsa Port of Catoosa on the Verdigris River, enters the Arkansas River near Muskogee, and runs via an extensive lock and dam system to the Mississippi River. Through Oklahoma and Arkansas, dams which artificially deepen and widen the river to sustain commercial barge traffic and recreational use give the river the appearance of a series of reservoirs.

The McClellan–Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System diverts from the Arkansas River upstream of the Wilbur D. Mills Dam to avoid the long winding route which the lower Arkansas River follows. This circuitous portion of the Arkansas River between the Wilbur D. Mills Dam and the Mississippi River was historically bypassed by river vessels. Early steamboats instead followed a network of rivers—known as the Arkansas Post Canal—which flowed north of the lower Arkansas River and followed a shorter and more direct route to the Mississippi River. When the McClellan–Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System was constructed between 1963 and 1970, the Arkansas Post Canal was significantly improved, while the lower Arkansas River continued to be bypassed by commercial vessels.

==In history==

Many nations of Native Americans lived near, or along, the 1,450-mile (2,334-km) stretch of the Arkansas River for thousands of years. The first Europeans to see the river were members of the Spanish Coronado expedition on June 29, 1541. Also in the 1540s, Hernando de Soto discovered the junction of the Arkansas with the Mississippi. The Spanish originally called the river &quot;Napeste&quot;. &quot;The name &quot;Arkansas&quot; was first applied by French Father Jacques Marquette, who called the river &quot;Akansa&quot; in his journal of 1673. The Joliet-Marquette expedition travelled the Mississippi River from Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin toward the Gulf of Mexico, but turned back at the mouth of the Arkansas River. By that time, they had encountered Native Americans carrying European trinkets and feared confrontation with Spanish conquistadors.

Jean-Baptiste Bénard de la Harpe, a French trader, explorer, and nobleman had led an expedition into what is now Oklahoma in 1718–19. His original objective was to establish a trading post near the present city of Texarkana, Arkansas, but he extended his trip overland as far north as the Arkansas River (which he designated as the &quot;Alcansas&quot;). The explorer wrote that he and nine other men, including three Caddo guides and 22 horses loaded with trade goods, had come to a native settlement overlooking the river, where there were about 6,000 natives, who gave the strangers a warm welcome. La Harpe&#x27;s party was honored with the calumet ceremony and spent ten days at this location.

In 1988, evidence of a native village was discovered along the Arkansas River south of present-day Tulsa, Oklahoma. By then, the site was known as the Lasley Vore Site.

French traders and trappers who had opened up trade with Indian tribes in Canada and the areas around the Great Lakes began exploring the Mississippi and some of its northern tributaries. They soon learned that the birchbark canoes, which had served them so well on the northern waterways, were too light for use on southern rivers such as the Arkansas. They turned to making and using dugout canoes, which they called &quot;pirogues&quot;, made by hollowing out the trunks of cottonwood trees. Cottonwoods are plentiful along the streams of the southwest and grow to large sizes. The wood is soft and easily worked with the crude tools carried by both the French and Indians. The pirogues were sturdier and could be more useful for navigating the sandbars and snags of the Southern waterways.

In 1819, the Adams–Onís Treaty set the Arkansas as part of the frontier between the United States and Spanish Mexico. This continued until the United States annexed Texas after the Mexican–American War, in 1846. The treaty was made shortly after the &quot;Old Settler&quot; Cherokee were pushed out of Texas and moved near what became known as Webbers Falls on the Arkansas River. They planned to reunite with the Cherokee who had moved there on the Trail of Tears in 1839. That area, then part of Arkansas Territory, would become Indian Territory and later Oklahoma. 

This area had long been the traditional territory of the Osage. They resisted the new Native Americans moving in with armed conflict. The US encouraged a peace treaty made in 1828 but the territory issue was still unresolved by the time thousands of additional Cherokee refugees moved to the area during the Trail of Tears.

By the time Fort Smith was established in 1817, larger capacity watercraft became available to transport goods up and down the Arkansas. These included flatboats (&quot;bateaus&quot;) and keelboats. Along with the pirogues, they transported piles of deer, bear, otter, beaver, and buffalo skins up and down the river. Agricultural products such as corn, rice, dried peaches, beans, peanuts, snakeroot, sarsaparilla, and ginseng had grown in economic importance.

On March 31, 1820, the &quot;Comet&quot; became the first steamboat to successfully navigate part of the Arkansas River, reaching a place called Arkansas Post, about above the confluence of the Arkansas and the Mississippi rivers. In mid-April 1822, the &quot;Robert Thompson&quot;, towing a keelboat, was the first steamboat to navigate the Arkansas as far as Fort Smith. For five years, Fort Smith was known as the head of navigation for steamboats on the river. It lost the title to Fort Gibson in April 1832, when three steamboats, &quot;Velocipede&quot;, &quot;Scioto,&quot; and &quot;Catawba&quot;, all arrived at Fort Gibson later that month.

Later, the Santa Fe Trail followed the Arkansas through much of Kansas, picking it up near Great Bend and continuing through to La Junta, Colorado. Some users elected to take the challenging Cimarron Cutoff starting at Cimarron, Kansas.

===American Civil War===

During the American Civil War, each side tried to prevent the other from using the Arkansas River and its tributaries as a route for moving reinforcements. Initially, the Union Army abandoned its forts in the Indian Territory, including Fort Gibson and Fort Smith, to maximize its strength for campaigns elsewhere. The Confederate Army sent troops from Texas to support its Native American allies. Union troops returned to the area later in the war, after defeating the Confederates at the Battle of Pea Ridge and the Battle of Fort Smith. They began recovering the position it had previously abandoned, most notably Fort Gibson and reopened the Arkansas River as a supply route. In September 1864, a body of Confederate irregulars led by General Stand Watie (Cherokee) successfully ambushed a Union supply ship bound for Fort Gibson. The vessel was destroyed, and a part of its cargo was looted by the Confederates.

===Post Civil War===
By 1890, water from the Arkansas River was being used to irrigate more than of farmland in Kansas. By 1910, irrigation projects in Colorado had caused the river to stop flowing in July and August.

Flooding in 1927 severely damaged or destroyed nearly every levee downstream of Fort Smith, and led to the development of the Arkansas River Flood Control Association. It also resulted in the Federal government assigning responsibility for flood control and navigation on the Arkansas River to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE).

==Angling==
The headwaters of the Arkansas River in central Colorado have been known for exceptional trout fishing, particularly fly fishing, since the 19th century, when greenback cutthroat trout dominated the river. Today, brown trout dominate the river, which also contains rainbow trout. &quot;Trout Unlimited&quot; considers the Arkansas one of the top 100 trout streams in America, a reputation the river has had since the 1950s. From Leadville to Pueblo, the Arkansas River is serviced by numerous fly shops and guides operating in Buena Vista, Salida, Cañon City, and Pueblo. Colorado Parks and Wildlife provides regular online fishing reports for the river.

A fish kill occurred on December 29, 2010, in which an estimated 100,000 freshwater drum lined the Arkansas River bank. An investigation, conducted by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, found the dead fish &quot;... cover of the river from the Ozark Lock and Dam downstream to River Mile 240, directly south of Hartman, Arkansas.&quot; Tests later indicated the likely cause of the kill was gas bubble trauma caused by opening the spillways on the Ozark Dam.

<doc id="267584" wikidata="Q1165879" url="?curid=267584" title="Darial Gorge">
<text>The Darial Gorge is a river gorge on the border between Russia and Georgia. It is at the east base of Mount Kazbek, south of present-day Vladikavkaz. The gorge was carved by the river Terek, and is approximately long. The steep granite walls of the gorge can be as much as tall in some places. The Georgian Military Road runs through the gorge.

== In history ==
The name &quot;Darial&quot; originates from &quot;Dar-i Alān&quot; () meaning &quot;Gate of the Alans&quot; in Persian. The Alans held the lands north of the pass in the first centuries AD. It was fortified in ancient times both by the Romans and Persians; the fortification was variously known as the Iberian Gates or the Caucasian Gates. It was also frequently mistakenly referred to as the Caspian Gates in classical literature. The pass is mentioned in the Georgian annals under the names of Darialani; Strabo calls it &quot;Porta Caucasica&quot; and &quot;Porta Cumana&quot;; Ptolemy, &quot;Fortes Sarmatica&quot;; it was sometimes known as &quot;Porta Caucasica&quot; and &quot;Portae Caspiae&quot; (a name bestowed also on the &quot;gate&quot; or pass beside the Caspian Sea at Derbent); and the Tatars call it Darioly.

Josephus wrote that Alexander the Great built iron gates at an unspecified pass which some Latin and Greek authors identified with Darial.

Darial Pass fell into Sassanid hands in 252–253, when the Sassanid Empire conquered and annexed Iberia. The control of the Darial Pass switched to the Western Turkic Kaganate in 628, when Tong Yabgu Kagan signed a treaty with Iberia, transferring over to the Kaganate the control of all its cities and fortresses, and establishing free trade. Control of Darial Pass switched to the Arab Rashidun Caliphate in 644. Afterwards, it was controlled by the Kingdom of Georgia. There was a battle point between the Ilkhanate and the Golden Horde, then indirectly controlled by Safavids and Qajar state, until it was captured by Russian Empire after annexation of Kingdom of Georgia in 1801–1830. It remained a strategic Russian forepost under Russian control until the dismemberment of the Soviet Union.

== Importance ==
The Darial Pass was historically important as one of only two crossings of the Caucasus mountain range, the other being the Derbent Pass. As a result, Darial Gorge has been fortified since at least 150 BC.

As the main border crossing between Georgia and Russia, it has been the site of Russians fleeing conscription for the Russo-Ukrainian War.

<text>Mount Si (pronounced ; , ) is a mountain in the northwest United States, east of Seattle, Washington. It lies on the western margin of the Cascade Range just above the coastal plains around Puget Sound, and towers over the nearby town of North Bend. Mount Si and neighboring mountain Little Si were named after local homesteader Josiah &quot;Uncle Si&quot; Merritt. The mountain became nationally familiar in the early 1990s with the television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, which was filmed in North Bend.

Only about a 45-minute drive from Seattle, the mountain is a favorite outdoor destination for residents of Puget Sound. Between 80,000 and 100,000 hikers visit the mountain annually. The land is owned by the state of Washington and has been designated a Natural Resources Conservation Area.

The Mount Si trail vertically climbs to the summit ridge. Its summit is reached by an exposed scramble, , up the north side of the summit block, which is known as the &quot;Haystack&quot;.

The peak can be accessed by two trails. The Old Mount Si trail is accessed by the Little Si parking lot and the Boulder Garden Loop. It is shorter, steeper in elevation gain, and less crowded than the main trail. The Mount Si trail is accessed by the Mount Si parking lot.

==Oceanic plate volcano==
Mount Si is a remnant of an oceanic plate volcano and the rocks are highly metamorphosed. The rock deposits are a melange including metagabbro, and are Jurassic-Cretaceous in age.

==In Snoqualmie culture==
Mount Si features prominently in a Prometheus story from the Snoqualmie people. According to Snoqualmie tradition, Mount Si is the fallen body of , or Moon, who is the paramount god in Snoqualmie traditional religion. Moon had ordered that a rope of cedar bark be stretched between the Earth and the sky. (Coyote) and (Blue Jay) went up the rope, with Blue Jay pecking a hole in the sky for Coyote to crawl through, where he found himself at the bottom of a lake. He transformed into a beaver, but got trapped in a beaver trap set by Moon. Coyote played dead to trick Moon and was brought back to his house, where he was skinned by Moon and his carcass thrown away in the corner, where he waited paitently.

When Moon had fallen asleep, Coyote re-applied his skin and explored the house of Moon, finding great forests, fire, the sun, and a contraption that made daylight among his possessions. Coyote then stole them, transforming back to his regular form and descending back down the rope to distribute what he had stolen across the earth. Awakening to find his possessions stolen, Moon chased Coyote down the cedar rope in anger, but it broke and he fell to his death, forming the mountain. Moon&#x27;s face is visible on the rocks near the summit.

<text>Schtonk! (subtitled &quot;Der Film zum Buch vom Führer&quot;; &quot;The film accompanying the &quot;Führer&#x27;s&quot; book&quot;) is a 1992 German satirical film which retells the story of the 1983 &quot;Hitler Diaries&quot; hoax. It was written and directed by Helmut Dietl.

==Background==

In 1983, the German magazine &quot;Stern&quot; began to publish the purported Hitler diaries with great fanfare. They were soon proven to be fake using basic forensic techniques.

Co-writer and director Helmut Dietl researched the scandal for two years and was quoted as having to leave out several real events from the film because they were too outrageous. The title is a bow to Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s classic &quot;The Great Dictator&quot;, in which the Tomainian dictator Adenoid Hynkel repeatedly uses &quot;Schtonk!&quot; as an expression of disgustthe word has no meaning in German.

== Plot ==
Fritz Knobel (the film&#x27;s alter-ego of real-life forger Konrad Kujau) supports himself by faking and selling Nazi memorabilia. He sells a portrait of Eva Braun and one volume of Hitler&#x27;s alleged diaries to factory owner Karl Lenz. Lenz presents this to his guests during a &quot;birthday party for the &quot;Führer&quot;&quot;, among whom is sleazy journalist Hermann Willié. Willié works for the magazine &quot;HH press&quot;, which links to Hamburg (as a licence plate abbreviation), where the &quot;Stern&quot; magazine is located and also to the common abbreviation for &quot;Heil Hitler&quot; among neo-Nazis. Knobel writes the subsequent diaries based on what happens around him; after he meets Martha and she becomes his lover beside his wife Biggi, she also becomes his inspiration for Eva Braun in the diaries. The rumors about his work cause a major Nazi craze among the high society, allowing former Nazi officials to use openly their Nazi ranks (e.g. Obergruppenführer). Willié becomes even more obsessed buying the old yacht &quot;Carin II&quot; of Hermann Göring and starting an affair with his (fictional) grandniece Freya von Hepp, based on Hermann Göring&#x27;s daughter Edda Göring.

Towards the end, the plot has developed its own dynamics, putting more and more pressure on Knobel to deliver the remaining volumes while permanently fearing the uncovering of the forgery. The volumes are convincing enough to fool the enthusiastic journalists, who are willing to overlook some oddities, especially a false monogram &quot;FH&quot; instead of &quot;AH&quot; on one of the volumes. They even invent &quot;alternative facts&quot; for their explanation (the term &quot;Führerhauptquartier&quot; instead of &quot;Adolf Hitler&quot; for instance). Later Knobel manages to manipulate a forensic graphoanalysis to his advantage but it seems only a matter of time until the truth is discovered. The constant fear and the struggle with a too close identification with the person he is writing about make Knobel collapse. His two spouses take over the initiative forcing him to pull himself out of the forgery business just in time, while the others fall, similar to the end of World War II, more or less hard according to their personal level of belief.

==Reception==
The film was a huge hit in Germany but performed badly in many other territories. It was the second highest grossing German film of the year with 1.9 million admissions, behind &quot;Otto: Der Liebesfilm&quot;.

== Awards ==
In 1992, &quot;Schtonk!&quot; won three awards at the German Film Awards in the categories &quot;Outstanding Feature Film&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Individual Achievement: Actor&quot; (Götz George) and &quot;Outstanding Individual Achievement: Direction&quot; (Helmut Dietl), as well as the Best Screenplay Award at the Tokyo International Film Festival (Helmut Dietl, Ulrich Limmer).

In 1993, Harald Juhnke won the Ernst Lubitsch Award for his role as Pit Kummer.

&quot;Schtonk!&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe in the category of &quot;Best Foreign Language Film&quot; in 1993, losing to the French film &quot;Indochine&quot; in both cases.

<text>The Mount Baker–Snoqualmie National Forest in Washington is a National Forest extending more than along the western slopes of the Cascade Range from the Canada–US border to the northern boundary of Mount Rainier National Park. It is administered by the United States Forest Service, which has headquarter offices for this forest in Everett. Local ranger district offices are in North Bend and Skykomish.

== History ==
Mount Baker National Forest was established as the Washington Forest Reserve on February 22, 1897, with . It became a national forest on March 4, 1907, and was renamed as Mount Baker National Forest on January 21, 1924. Snoqualmie National Forest was established from land in Washington NF on 1 July 1908 with 961,120 acres (3,889.52 km2). A part of Rainier National Forest was added on October 19, 1933. The two were administratively combined in 1974.

The 1935 version of &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;, starring Clark Gable, Loretta Young and Jack Oakie, was filmed on location in Mount Baker National Forest. Twentieth Century Pictures believed the location was remote enough to guarantee lack of interruption from skiers and other forest visitors. Paramount Pictures later filmed &quot;The Barrier&quot; (1937) at Mount Baker Lodge.

==Visitation==
The Mount Baker–Snoqualmie National Forest covers (in descending order of forestland area) portions of Snohomish, Whatcom, Skagit, King, Pierce, and Kittitas counties. It has a total area of . The forest consists of four ranger districts. The following are listed geographically from north to south: the Mount Baker District has two ranger stations, located in Glacier and Sedro-Woolley; the Darrington Ranger District has two ranger stations, located in Darrington and Verlot; the Skykomish Ranger District has one ranger station located in Skykomish; and the Snoqualmie Ranger District has two ranger stations, located in North Bend and Enumclaw.

Together with the other central Puget Sound counties, 62% (3.63 million people) of the state&#x27;s population live within a drive of the forest. Another 1.5 million in the Vancouver metropolitan area are also within easy reach of the northern part of the forest. The large population, coupled with easy road access, has resulted in the Mount Baker–Snoqualmie National Forest being the most visited national forest in the country.

==Geography==

===Mountains===
The Mount Baker–Snoqualmie National Forest contains many scenic and historical points of interest. Mountain tops gradually rise from on the south end of the forest to in the north. Two tall volcanoes, Mount Baker and Glacier Peak, tower thousands of feet above the adjacent ridges.

===Glaciers===
The forest is home to more glaciers and snow fields than any other national forest outside Alaska. , the largest glaciers—with surface areas greater than —are:
* Mount Baker
** Roosevelt
** Mazama
** Park
** Boulder
** Easton
** Deming
** Coleman
* Sentinel Peak
** South Cascade Glacier
* Glacier Peak
** Suiattle
** Honeycomb
** White Chuck
The number of glaciers in the forest has decreased from 295 in 1971 to fewer than 287 in 1998. This is a part of the global phenomenon of glacier retreat. Forest glaciers have lost between 20 and 40% of their volume between 1984 and 2006. This is due to continued warm conditions from climate change and negative mass balance.

White Chuck Glacier (Glacier Peak) is no longer on the list of large glaciers, above. It shrank from from 1958 to 2002. With the shrinking of the glaciers, summer glacial runoff has been reduced by 65 to 80%. This reduces streamflow and sediment and increases water temperature. Salmon and many other species are adversely affected by such changes.

==Conservation==
The north and east portions of the forest are exceptionally rugged and scenic. In 1968, part of the forest was transferred to the National Park Service to be within North Cascades National Park. A 1993 Forest Service study estimated that the extent of old growth in the forest was .

In addition, Congressional action since 1964 has established the following wilderness areas, which comprise —almost half of the forest&#x27;s area:
* Alpine Lakes Wilderness (mostly in Wenatchee NF)
* Boulder River Wilderness
* Clearwater Wilderness
* Glacier Peak Wilderness (mostly in Wenatchee NF)
* Henry M. Jackson Wilderness (partly in Wenatchee NF)
* Mount Baker Wilderness
* Noisy-Diobsud Wilderness
* Norse Peak Wilderness
* Pasayten Wilderness (mostly in Okanogan NF)
* Wild Sky Wilderness
These pristine areas provide clean water, solitude, and permanent protection to old-growth forests across 42% of the Mount Baker–Snoqualmie National Forest.

Congress also established the Skagit Wild and Scenic River System in 1978. Its of rivers on the Skagit, Cascade, Sauk, and Suiattle rivers provide important wildlife habitat and recreation. The Skagit River System is home to one of the largest winter populations of bald eagles in the United States.

The Mount Baker–Snoqualmie National Forest encompasses much of the North Cascades ecoregion, a Level III North American Ecoregion. It includes the following level IV ecoregions:
* Western Hemlock Ecoregion
* Silver Fir Ecoregion
* Subalpine Mountain Hemlock Ecoregion
* Alpine Ecoregion

<text>The Private Express Statutes (PES) are a group of United States federal civil and criminal laws placing various restrictions on the carriage and delivery of letters by all organizations other than the United States Postal Service.

==History==
The United States Congress originally passed the PES in 1792, under powers granted it in the United States Constitution to &quot;establish Post Offices and Post Roads.&quot; The PES granted the government the power for the carriage and delivery of letter mail. Today the USPS is empowered to suspend the PES, if it believes such a private postal service would be in the interests of the general public.

The PES consists of and , implemented under 39 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 310 and 320. These restrict the carriage and delivery of letter mail by private organizations, except as described in the next section. The PES only cover &quot;letters&quot; and not other mailable items such as parcels or periodicals.

==Exceptions==
===&quot;Extremely urgent&quot; letters===
In 1979 the Postal Service authorized the delivery of &quot;extremely urgent&quot; letters outside the USPS; this has given rise to delivery services such as Federal Express and UPS&#x27;s express mail services. Records of pick up and delivery must be maintained for Postal Service inspection if the time sensitive exception is being used.

===Lawful private carriage===
It is possible to set up a private mail delivery service known as &quot;lawful private carriage&quot; if the USPS postage is paid in &quot;addition&quot; to any private postage fee that is collected. Records must be maintained that such postage has been paid, and it must be affixed to the letter cover by U.S. stamps, meter imprints or through another method approved by the USPS; the postage must be canceled by the sender in ink; the date of mailing must be affixed in ink to the cover (either by sender or carrier); and the letter cannot be removed without defacing the cover from the envelope or other container in which the letter is sent. An agreement must be entered into with the Postal Service to conduct &quot;volume&quot; private carriage through the Pricing and Classification Service Center.

===Occasional private mail delivery===
One does not need to establish a private mail delivery service for the occasional commercial transport of a letter outside the mails so long as the rate which would have been due to the USPS is affixed in stamps, the stamps are cancelled in ink, and the date of receipt by the carrier or the transport of the letter, are noted thereon. All these privately carried letters can bear a private cancellation if the cancellation is done in ink; private cancellations are different from private overprints on postage stamps.

===Special messenger services===
There are limited exceptions for special messenger services which deliver less than twenty-five letters for an individual or company per occasion. In such case no postage need be paid or affixed to the letters; pick up and delivery can be from private residences and commercial businesses.

===Free delivery===

The delivery of letters without compensation and without the affixation or payment of any postage is allowed under 39 CFR 310.3(c) by third parties, and under 39 CFR 310.3(b) for one&#x27;s own letters which includes regular employees only delivering company mail. Thus, it is not a violation of the PES if one delivers a letter of one&#x27;s friend even without affixation of postage or if a company has one of its regular employees deliver mail that originates from the company to its customers. Compensation is considered to include barter and goodwill. Thus an individual or business who receives a benefit for the delivery of letters does not fall under such a free carriage exception. For example, buying a friend dinner in exchange for having him deliver a letter is not considered without compensation; in such a case one would be required to affix and cancel a sufficient amount of postage to the letter. Another example not falling under this exception would be a business that is carrying letters &quot;free of charge&quot; in the hopes of building business or incidental to some other delivery as an accommodation for its customer; this use would also require the affixation and cancellation of a sufficient amount of postage to be in compliance with the PES.

===Cargo delivery===
There is an exception for the delivery of what otherwise would be considered a letter if it is sent with cargo and the letter is somehow incidental to the ordering, delivery or shipping of the cargo [39 CFR 310.3(a)].

===Other exceptions ===

Other exceptions to the PES include:
* Letters that at some point during their pick-up or delivery had previously entered into the USPS mailstream, unless the letters are consolidated.
* Letters addressed to specific persons that fall outside the purview of the PES.
* Certain documents and objects that are not considered letters, even though containing a message.

<doc id="267603" wikidata="Q3026262" url="?curid=267603" title="Killings and massacres during the 1948 Palestine war">
<text>During the 1948 Palestine war, massacres and acts of terror were conducted by and against both sides. A campaign of massacres and violence against the Arab population – such as occurred in the expulsions from Lydda and Ramle and the Fall of Haifa – led to the expulsion and flight of over 700,000 Palestinians, with most of their urban areas being depopulated and destroyed. This violence and dispossession of the Palestinians is known today as the Nakba (Arabic for &quot;the disaster&quot;).

==Background==

After about 30 years of conflict in Mandatory Palestine between Palestinian Arabs, the British authorities and Palestinian Jews, the British decided in February 1947 to terminate the Mandate and, on 29 November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 181 (II) recommending the adoption and implementation of a plan of partition of Palestine.

The vote was rejected by the Arab parties, and was immediately followed by a civil war between Palestinian Arabs who were supported by the Arab Liberation Army against the Palestinian Jews, while the region was still fully under British rule.
The day after the vote, Arabs launched attacks against the Jews, killing 126 of them during the first two weeks and 75 were massacred in a refugee camp in Aden as a retaliation. In Jerusalem, attacks targeted Jewish businesses and residents of Jewish neighborhoods, some of whom were stabbed in the street or murdered on buses. Jews were also attacked in Arab neighborhoods. In the Kibbutz of Gvulot, six Jewish teenage girls were murdered. In major cities, snipers (including mercenaries) fired at Jewish pedestrians and traffic. The Carmel Market was also attacked and grenades were thrown in the Jewish quarters. Across the country, Jewish cars were the target of stone throwing, while the consulates of Poland and Sweden, which voted in favor of partition, were attacked. In December 1947, one of the striking images remains the attack on the new Mamilla Mall.

On 15 May 1948, following the Israeli Declaration of Independence the previous day, the armies of a number of Arab countries invaded what had just ceased to be Mandatory Palestine, turning the conflict into the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The yishuv ( now officially called Israel) suffered between 5,700 and 5,800 casualties. The death toll on the Arab side is unclear, but according to Benny Morris, it might have been slightly higher or much higher than the Jewish one. In his book, Morris mentions an estimate of 12,000 provided by Haj Amin al-Husseini in 1950. These numbers amount to around 1 percent of the population of each side.

==Massacres==
According to several historians, between 10 and 70 massacres occurred during the 1948 war. According to Benny Morris the Yishuv (or later Israeli) soldiers killed roughly 800 Arab civilians and prisoners of war in 24 massacres. Aryeh Yizthaki list 10 major massacres with more than 50 victims each. Palestinian researcher Salman Abu-Sitta lists 33 massacres, half of them occurring during the civil war period. Saleh Abdel Jawad lists 68 villages where acts of indiscriminate killing of prisoners, and civilians took place, where no threat was posed to Yishuv or Israeli soldiers.

The main massacres and attacks against Jewish civilians were the Haifa Oil Refinery massacre where 39 Jews were killed by Arab workers after Irgun members had thrown a bomb into the crowd and the Kfar Etzion massacre where around 120-150 residents and defenders were killed by Arab irregulars, according to some accounts with the participation of Arab Legion soldiers. The Hadassah medical convoy massacre, with 80 deaths, included the mass killing of medical personnel by Arabs.

According to Rosemarie Esber, both Israeli archives and Palestinian testimonies confirm killings occurred in numerous Arab villages. Most of these killings occurred as villages were overrun and captured during the Second phase of the Civil War, Operation Dani, Operation Hiram and Operation Yoav. Morris said that the &quot;worst cases&quot; were the Saliha massacre with 60 to 70 killed, the Deir Yassin massacre with around 112, the Lydda massacre with around 250, the Tantura massacre with between 40 and 200+, and the Abu Shusha massacre with 60–70. In Al-Dawayima, accounts of the death toll vary. Saleh Abd al-Jawad reports 100-200 casualties, Morris has estimated &quot;hundreds&quot; and also reports the IDF investigation which concluded 100 villagers had been killed. David Ben-Gurion gave the figure of 70–80. Saleh Abd al-Jawad reports on the village&#x27;s mukhtar account that 455 people were missing following the al-Dawayima massacre, including 170 women and children.

==Bombing attacks==
At the beginning of the Civil War, Jewish militias organized several bombing attacks against civilians and military Arab targets. On 12 December 1947, the Irgun placed a car bomb opposite the Damascus Gate, the main entrance to the Old City of Jerusalem, killing 20 people. On 4 January 1948, the Lehi detonated a lorry bomb against the headquarters of the paramilitary al-Najjada located in Jaffa&#x27;s Town Hall, killing 15 Arabs and injuring 80.

During the night between 5 and 6 January, in Jerusalem, the Haganah bombed the Semiramis Hotel that had been reported to hide Arab militiamen, killing 24 people. The next day, Irgun members in a stolen police van rolled a barrel bomb into a large group of civilians who were waiting for a bus by the Jaffa Gate, killing 20. Another Irgun bomb went off in the Ramla market on 18 February, killing 7 residents and injuring 45. On 28 February, the Palmach organised a bombing attack against a garage in Haifa, killing 30 people.

From 1 February 1948, supporters of Amin al-Husseini organised, with the help of British deserters, three attacks against the Jewish community in Jerusalem. Using car bombs aimed at the headquarters of the &quot;Palestine Post&quot;, the Ben Yehuda Street market and the backyard of the Jewish Agency&#x27;s offices, killing 22, 53 and 13 Jewish people respectively.

During the first months of 1948, the railway between Cairo and Haifa was often targeted. On 31 March, it was mined near Binyamina, a Jewish settlement in the neighborhood of Caesarea, killing 40 persons and wounding 60. The casualties were all civilians, mostly Arabs. Although there were some soldiers on the train, none were injured. The &quot;Palestine Post&quot; and the &quot;New York Times&quot; attributed the attack to Lehi.

==List of killings and massacres==
Here is a non-exhaustive list of killings and massacres that took place during the war:
==Effects==

Violence against Palestinians had a strong impact on the exodus of the Palestinian Arab population. For example, the Deir Yassin massacre is considered to have generated more panic among the Arab population than all other previous operations together and to have caused a mass flight of Palestinians in numerous areas, Additionally, the Deir Yassin massacre became a strong argument for the Arab states to intervene against Israel. Arab League chief Azzam Pasha stated that &#x27;The massacre of Deir Yassin was to a great extent the cause of the wrath of the Arab nations and the most important factor for sending [in] the Arab armies&#x27;.

==Historiography ==
=== New Historians ===
In the 1980s a group of revisionist Israeli historians, known as the New Historians, challenged the official Israeli historical narrative.

=== Arab warnings and threats of massacres against Jews of Palestine ===
After the Partition vote, some Arab leaders threatened the Jewish population of Palestine. For example, they spoke of &quot;driving the Jews into the sea&quot; or ridding Palestine &quot;of the Zionist Plague&quot;.

According to the Israeli traditional historiography, these statements reflected the Arab intentions. While Benny Morris considers the real picture of the Arab aims to be more complex, notably because they were well aware they could not defeat the Jews, he argues that the Yishuv was indeed threatened with extinction and feared what would happen if the Arabs won. Gelber, on the other hand, regards these public statements as &#x27;meaningless&#x27; and judges that the &#x27;actions [of their armies] imply that the aims of the Arab invasion were decidedly limited and focused mainly on saving Arab Palestine from total Jewish domination&#x27;.

=== &quot;Purity of arms&quot; ===

During the conflict between Arabs and Jews in Palestine before the war, the criterion of &quot;purity of arms&quot; was used to distinguish between the respective attitudes of the Irgun and Haganah towards Arabs, with the latter priding itself on its adherence to this principle. Generally speaking, this precept requires that &quot;weapons remain pure [and that] they are employed only in self-defence and [never] against innocent civilians and defenceless people&quot;. But if it &quot;remained a central value in education&quot; it was &quot;rather vague and intentionally blurred&quot; at the practical level.

In 1946, at a meeting held between the heads of the Haganah, Ben-Gurion predicted a confrontation between the Arabs of Palestine and the Arab states. Concerning the &quot;principle of purity of arms&quot;, he stressed that: &quot;The end does not justify all means. Our war is based on moral grounds&quot; and during the 1948 War, the Mapam, the political party affiliated to Palmach, asked for &quot;a strict observance of the Jewish Purity of arms to secure the moral character of [the] war&quot;.

When he was criticized by Mapam members for his attitude concerning the Arab refugee problem, Ben-Gurion reminded them the events of Lydda and Ramla and the fact Palmach officers had been responsible for the &quot;outrage that had encouraged the Arabs&#x27; flight made the party uncomfortable.&quot;

According to Avi Shlaim, &quot;purity of arms&quot; is one of the key features of &#x27;the conventional Zionist account or old history&#x27; whose &#x27;popular-heroic-moralistic version of the 1948 war&#x27; is &#x27;taught in Israeli schools and used extensively in the quest for legitimacy abroad&#x27;. Morris adds that &#x27;[t]he Israelis&#x27; collective memory of fighters characterized by &quot;purity of arms&quot; is also undermined by the evidence of [the dozen case] of rapes committed in conquered towns and villages.&#x27; According to him, &#x27;after the war, the Israelis tended to hail the &quot;purity of arms&quot; of its militiamen and soldiers to contrast this with Arab barbarism, which on occasion expressed itself in the mutilation of captured Jewish corpses.&#x27; According to him, &#x27;this reinforced the Israelis&#x27; positive self-image and helped them &quot;sell&quot; the new state abroad and (...) demonized the enemy&#x27;.

=== Causes of massacres ===
According to Ilan Pappé, massacres targeting Palestinians took place in the context of an ethnic cleansing that &quot;carr[ied] with it atrocious acts of mass killing and butchering of thousands of Palestinians were killed ruthlessly and savagely by Israeli troops of all backgrounds, ranks and ages.&quot;

Morris also said that despite their rhetoric, Arab armies committed few atrocities and no large-scale massacre of prisoners took place when circumstances might have allowed them to happen, as when they took the Old City of Jerusalem or the villages of Atarot, Neve Yaakov, Nitzanim, Gezer and Mishmar Hayarden. On 28 May, when the inhabitants and fighters of the Old City surrendered, in fear for their lives, the Transjordanian Arab Legion protected them from the mob and even wounded or shot dead other Arabs. Atrocities committed by the Arab armies included women being dismembered in Nitzanim in June, 14 Jewish civilians killed while supplying an orphanage in Ben Shemen and Arab fighters parading with the heads of two Israeli soldiers impaled on stakes in Eilabun. Jewish combatants captured by Arab militias, were frequently tortured and mutilated in particularly violent ways. Pregnant women have also been found disembowelled.

With regard to massacres perpetrated by the IDF at the end of the war and particularly during Operation Hiram, Morris and Yoav Gelber consider that lack of discipline cannot explain the violence. Gelber points out the &quot;hard feelings [of the soldiers] towards the Palestinians&quot; and the fact that the Palestinians had not fled like in former operations. Benny Morris thinks that they were related to a &quot;general vengefulness and a desire by local commanders to precipitate a civilian exodus&quot;.

=== Tantura massacre controversy ===

There was a significant controversy regarding the Tantura massacre, with some historians such as Yoav Gelber denying that a massacre had taken place.

Gelber wrote that based on a counting of the inhabitants, the refugees, the POW&#x27;s and the deaths, there were no people missing and therefore no massacre could have occurred.

Morris&#x27;s analysis concludes that the documentation and the interviews do not prove that a massacre occurred but that the hypothesis cannot be simply dismissed.

Ilan Pappé considers that the testimonies of former Alexandroni soldiers and Palestinian refugees prove, on the contrary, that at least 200 unarmed Tantura villagers were killed, whether in revenge for the death of Israeli soldiers due to sniper shots or later when they were unjustifiably accused of hiding weapons.

===Palestinian perspectives ===
Nadine Picaudou, author of &quot;The Historiography of the 1948 Wars&quot;, studied the evolution of Palestinian historiography on the 1948 war. She argues that the Deir Yassin massacre long remained the only one discussed &#x27;as if it sufficed to summarize the tragedy of Palestinian victims&#x27;. She thinks that during the period for which &#x27;collective memory conflated with Palestinian nationalist mobilization, one exemplary event sufficed to express the tragedy&#x27;. Referring to the study performed in 2007 by Saleh Abd al-Jawad, &quot;Zionist Massacres: the Creation of the Palestinian Refugee Problem in the 1948 War&quot;, she writes that the massacres engaged Palestinian historians&#x27; concerns relatively late, but that when &quot;Palestinians began to write their history, the issue of massacres inevitably became one of the relevant factors in accounting for the mass exodus.&quot;

Picaudou underlines that &quot;Palestinian historiography has retained the nakba paradigm, which reduces the Palestinians to the status of passive victims of Israeli policies, as [illustrated by] the limited attention accorded by researchers to the 1947–48 battles (...)&quot;.

===&quot;Battles&quot; or &quot;massacres&quot;===
In the context of the 1948 war, several historians pointed out the nuance, sometimes polemically, that can exist between a &quot;battle&quot; and a &quot;massacre&quot;.

====Deir Yassin====

The village of Deir Yassin was located west of Jerusalem, but its strategic importance was debatable and its inhabitants had not participated in the war until one week before the attack. On 9 April, around 120 men from the Irgun and the Lehi attacked the village in the context of the Operation Nachshon. The poorly armed inhabitants showed unexpected resistance to the attack by fighting back. The assailants suffered four dead. Jacques de Reynier, head of the International Red Cross delegation in Palestine, visited Deir Yassin on April 11, 1948, and observed &quot;a total of more than 200 dead, men, women, and children.&quot; After the fighting, some villagers were executed after being exhibited in the streets of Jerusalem. A group of prisoners were executed in a nearby quarry and others at Sheikh Bader. Historians estimate today the total number of deaths at 100 to 120.

In 2007, Israeli military historian Uri Milstein published a controversial book, &quot;Blood Libel at Deir Yassin,&quot; in which he claims that the events of Deir Yassin were the result of a battle and not of a massacre. Moreover, he goes further and rejects the reality of the atrocities that followed the attack on the village. Morris considers that the capture of the village, insignificant on the military point of view, can hardly be considered as a &quot;battle&quot;.

====Hadassah medical convoy====

In 1948, Hadassah hospital was located in the enclave of the Mount Scopus, at Jerusalem from where it dominated several Arab quarters. On 14 April, a convoy carrying medical personnel, some injured fighters, munitions and some reinforcement troops, that was protected by Haganah soldiers and armoured cars, tried to reach the enclave. Arab fighters had been informed by an Australian officer that the convoy&#x27;s mission was to use the enclave to attack Arab quarters and cut off the road to Ramallah. A large Arab force then ambushed the convoy, and, in the fight, several vehicles were shot up, and couldn&#x27;t withdraw. The battle raged for seven hours and British intervention was late in coming. 79 people from the convoy were killed, mainly civilians. Following the incident, Jacques de Reynier urged that in future all convoys be relieved of military escorts and placed under Red Cross protection. This was quickly agreed to. He also asked that the enclave be demilitarised under similar conditions, but this was refused by the Zionist authorities.

While the whole event is usually seen as a massacre, Morris considers it to have been, rather, a battle, given that there was shooting between Arab and Haganah militia and targeted a supply convoy headed for Mount Scopus. He points out however that the death toll incurred by medical personal, who were unarmed, was massive and that seventy-eight people were &quot;slaughtered&quot;.

====Lydda====

In July 1948, the Israelis launched the Operation Danny to conquer the cities of Lydda and Ramle. The first attack on Lydda occurred on the afternoon of 11 July when the 89th battalion mounted on armoured cars and jeeps raided the city &quot;spraying machine-gun fire at anything that moved&quot;. &quot;Dozens of Arabs (perhaps as many as 200)&quot; were killed. According to Morris, the description of this raid written by one of the soldiers &quot;combine[s] elements of a battle and a massacre&quot;.

Later, Israeli troops entered the city and took up position in the town center. The only resistance came from the police fort that was held by some Arab Legionnaires and irregulars. Detention compounds were arranged in the mosques and the churches for adult males and 300–400 Israeli soldiers garrisoned the town. In the morning of 12 July, the situation was calm but around 11:30 an incident occurred; two or three armored cars entered the town and a firefight erupted. The skirmish made Lydda&#x27;s townspeople believe that the Arab Legion was counter-attacking and probably a few dozen snipers fired against the occupying troops. Israeli soldiers felt threatened, vulnerable because they were isolated among thousands of hostile townspeople and &#x27;angry [because] they had understood that the town had surrendered&#x27;. &#x27;[They] were told to shoot &#x27;at any clear target&#x27; or, alternatively, at anyone &#x27;seen on the streets&#x27;. The Arab inhabitants panicked. Many rushed in the streets and were killed.

There is controversy among historians about the events that followed. According to Morris, at the Dahmash mosque some prisoners tried to break out and escape, probably fearing to be massacred. IDF threw grenades and fired rockets at the compound and several dozens Arabs were shot and killed. The Palestinian historiography describes the events differently. According to it, it was civilians that had taken refuge in the mosque, thinking that the Israelis would not dare to profane the sanctuary. The Israelis killed all the people there making 93 to 176 dead. Alon Kadish and Avraham Sela write that there is a confusion between two mosques. According to them, detainees were only gathered around the Great Mosque, where no incident occurred and it is a group of 50-60 armed Arabs who barricaded in the Dahmash mosque. Its storming resulted in the death of 30 Arab militiamen and civilians, including elderly, women and children.

The deaths of July 12 are regarded in the Arab world and by several historians as a massacre. Walid Khalidi calls it &quot;an orgy of indiscriminate killing.&quot; Morris writes that the &quot;jittery Palmahniks massacr[ed] detainees in a mosque compound.&quot; According to Gelber, it was a &quot;bloodier massacre&quot; than at Deir Yassin. Alon Kadish and Avraham Sela write that it was &quot;an intense battle where the demarcation between civilians, irregular combatants and regular army units hardly existed.&quot;

<text>Merrill Church Meigs (November 25, 1883January 26, 1968) was the publisher of the &quot;Chicago Herald and Examiner&quot; in the 1920s. Inspired to become a pilot by Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean, he became a booster of Chicago as a world center of aviation.
He gave flying lessons to President Harry S. Truman.

==Life and career==
Meigs was born in Poweshiek County, Iowa, the son of Church Paddleford Meigs and Julianna S. (Burrell) Meigs. He grew up on a farm near Malcom, Iowa, where he was more interested in the mechanical devices used to raise crops than actually farming. In 1901, he took a job as a salesman for the J.I. Case Threshing Machine Company in Racine, Wisconsin. Within a year, he was in charge of the company&#x27;s sales for South America. Despite not having graduated from high school, Meigs was allowed to enroll at the University of Chicago, where he played football under Amos Alonzo Stagg and also played baseball and water polo. He was the starting left guard of the 1905 University of Chicago national championship team . While at the college, he would also be the campus correspondent for the &quot;Chicago Herald and Examiner&quot;, of which he would become the executive later in his life. During World War II, Meigs served on the Office of Production Management as the aircraft expert.

In time Meigs would become a senior vice president of the Hearst Corporation, publisher of the old &quot;Chicago American&quot; newspaper as well as becoming the head of the Chicago Aero Commission. Meigs insisted that in addition to Midway Airport (then called Municipal Airport) and O&#x27;Hare Field (then called Orchard-Douglas), the city needed an airfield within ten minutes of the Loop. It opened in December 1948 and was renamed Meigs Field in his honor the following year. Fifty-five years after the renaming, Meigs Field was demolished by order of then-Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley.

Meigs retired in 1962 and became a consultant to the newspaper industry. He died at age 84.

<text>Máximo Francisco Repilado Muñoz Telles (18 November 1907 – 13 July 2003), known professionally as &quot;Compay Segundo&quot;, was a Cuban trova guitarist, singer and composer.

==Biography==
Compay (meaning &quot;compadre&quot;) Segundo, so called because he was always second voice in his musical partnerships, was born in Siboney, Cuba, and moved to Santiago de Cuba at the age of nine. His first engagement was in the Municipal Band of Santiago de Cuba, directed by his teacher, Enrique Bueno. In 1934, after a spell in a quintet, he moved to Havana, where he also played the clarinet in CI the Municipal Band. He also learned to play the guitar and the tres, which became his usual instruments. Compay Segundo also invented the armónico, a seven-stringed guitar-like instrument, to fill the harmonic jump between the Spanish guitar and the tres.
In the 1950s he became well known as the second voice and tres player in Los Compadres, a duo he formed with Lorenzo Hierrezuelo in 1947.

Los Compadres were one of the most successful Cuban duos of their time. The rediscovery of his music in Spain was with the help of Santiago Auserón in the 90&#x27;s. Greater international fame came later, in 1997, with the release of the &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot; album, a hugely successful recording which won several Grammy awards. Compay Segundo appeared in the Wim Wenders film of the same title.

Segundo&#x27;s most famous composition is &quot;Chan Chan&quot;, the opening track on the &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot; album, a four-chord son cubano song. &quot;Chan Chan&quot; was recorded by Segundo himself various times as well as by countless other Latin artists. Other compositions are &quot;Sarandonga&quot;, &quot;La calabaza&quot;, &quot;Hey caramba&quot;, &quot;Macusa&quot;, &quot;Saludo Compay&quot;. These are all &quot;sones&quot;, and this differentiates siu him from the more usual trova musicians, with their devotion to the bolero. However, it seems his interests went much further:
:I have danzones, waltzes, sones. I have some beautiful danzones. Why? Because I&#x27;ve learned from those who know how to preserve the tradition of the music. I play music the way it was played in yesteryear. I started out playing the &quot;son corto&quot; (short son). As Miguel Matamoros used to say, &quot;The son is short and sweet.&quot;... Back in the day, they&#x27;d start out playing son at seven in the evening, and they&#x27;d greet the dawn with it.

At a fiesta he sang to President Fidel Castro, who took his pulse and joked about his vitality despite his 90-plus years. &quot;Who could have imagined that?&quot; he asked when he found himself at the Vatican City, performing &quot;Chan Chan&quot; before Pope John Paul II. He explained his longevity simply: mutton consommé and a drink of rum.

He predicted that he would live to be 115, but died of kidney failure in Havana, 20 years short of his ambition. 
In 2007, the 100th anniversary of Segundo&#x27;s birth was celebrated with a concert of his compositions performed by a symphony orchestra in Havana with some of his musicians and sons.

<text>Mount Kazbek or Mount Kazbegi is a dormant stratovolcano and one of the major mountains of the Caucasus, located in Georgia, just south of the border with Russia.

Lying at 5,054 meters (16,581 ft) above at sea level, Mount Kazbek is the highest mountain in Eastern Georgia. It is also the third-highest peak in the country (after Mount Shkhara and Janga). Kazbegi is the second-highest volcanic summit in the Caucasus, after Mount Elbrus. The summit lies directly to the west of the town of Stepantsminda and is the most prominent geographic feature of the area. The last eruption occurred .

== Origin of the name ==
The name Kazbegi is disputed; some claims are it is named after a Circassian nobleman who lived on it, other claims are it is named after local nobleman Dimitri Chopikashvili (grand father of the Georgian writer Aleksandre Kazbegi) who was given the title of &quot;Kazbeg&quot; by Georgian king Erekle II. The word &quot;Kazbek&quot; means a &quot;nobleman&quot; in Kabardian language. The title appeared under Georgian king Rostom in the 17th century. The name of the mountain in Georgian, &quot;Mqinvartsveri&quot;, translates to &quot;Glacier Peak&quot; or &quot;Freezing Cold Peak&quot;. The Ingush name &quot;Beshloam&quot; and Chechen name &quot;Bashlam&quot; translates as &quot;Molten Mount&quot;.

==Location==
Kazbek is located on the Khokh Range, a mountain range which runs north of the Greater Caucasus Range, and which is pierced by the gorges of the Ardon and the Terek. At its eastern foot runs the Georgian Military Road through the pass of Darial 2,378 meters (7,805 feet). The mountain itself lies along the edge of the Borjomi–Kazbegi Fault (which is a northern sub-ending of the North Anatolian Fault). The region is highly active tectonically, with numerous small earthquakes occurring at regular intervals. An active geothermal/hot spring system also surrounds the mountain. Kazbek is a potentially active volcano, built up of trachyte and sheathed with lava, and has the shape of a double cone, whose base lies at an altitude of 1,770 meters (5,800 feet). Kazbek is the highest of the volcanic cones of the Kazbegi volcanic group which also includes Mount Khabarjina (3,142 metres).

Owing to the steepness of its slopes, the glaciers of Kazbek are not very large. The total combined area of all of Kazbek&#x27;s glaciers is 135 km2. The best-known glacier is the Dyevdorak (Devdaraki), which creeps down the north-eastern slope into a gorge of the same name, reaching a level of 2,295 meters (7,530 feet). Kazbegi&#x27;s other glaciers include the Mna, Denkara, Gergeti, Abano, and Chata. The recent collapse of the Kolka Glacier, located in a valley between Mt. Jimara and Kazbegi in the year 2002 was attributed to solfatara volcanic activity along the northern slope of the mountain, although there was no eruption. In addition to the 2002 event, a massive collapse of the Devdaraki Glacier on the mountain&#x27;s northeastern slope which occurred on August 20, 2014, led to the death of seven people. The glacier collapse dammed the Terek River in the Daryal Gorge and flooded the Georgian Military Highway.

From 24 to 28 May 2019 Caucasus Skitouring Network organized an expedition to survey Mt. Kazbegi&#x27;s height. On 27 May 2019 at 12:22 GMT+4, for the first time, a survey team placed a GPS receiver on the Mt. Kazbegi peak. The new height is defined with the WGS 84 datum. Height was determinate with 5mm accuracy. Defined height is 5053.927m.

==Legend==
Mount Kazbegi is associated in Georgian folklore with Amirani, the Georgian version of Prometheus, who was chained on the mountain in punishment for having stolen fire from the gods and giving it to mortals. The location of his imprisonment later became the site of an Orthodox hermitage located in a cave called &quot;Betlemi&quot; (Bethlehem) at approximately the 4,000-meter level. According to legends, this cave housed many sacred relics, including Abraham&#x27;s tent and the manger of the infant Jesus.

According to Prince Ioane of Georgia, Ingush mountaineer Yosif Buzurtanov, also known as &quot;Yosif the Mokhevian&quot;, was the first to ascend the mountain peak of Kazbek in the late eighteenth century during the reign of Heraclius II of Georgia, though, officially, this occurred in 1868 by D. W. Freshfield, A. W. Moore, and C. Tucker of the Alpine Club, with the guide François Devouassoud, guided by local Gveletians climbers, among them Tsogol Buzurtanov (son of Yosif Buzurtanov). They were followed by Russian alpinists Vladimir Kozmin and Maria Preobrazhenskaya, who made the climb nine times starting in 1900.

==Kazbegi nature reserve==
The area around Mount Kazbegi was designated a nature reserve by the Soviet government in 1979, and includes beech forests, subalpine forests and alpine meadows. Many of the plants and animals in the reserve are endemic to the Caucasus region.

==Climate==
Mount Kazbek summit has a polar ice cap climate (Köppen: EF).

<doc id="267615" wikidata="Q311620" url="?curid=267615" title="Procmail">
<text>procmail is an email server software component — specifically, a message delivery agent (MDA). It was one of the earliest mail filter programs. It is typically used in Unix-like mail systems, using the mbox and Maildir storage formats.

procmail was first developed in 1990, by Stephen R. van den Berg. Philip Guenther took over maintainership for a number of years, but relinquished the role in 2014. The software remained unmaintained for several years, and was believed to be defunct. In 2020 May, Stephen van den Berg resumed maintenance again. The program has since seen multiple releases and bug-fixes.

== Uses ==

The most common use case for procmail is to filter mail into different mailboxes, based on criteria such as sender address, subject keywords, and/or mailing list address.

Another use is to let procmail call an external spam filter program, such as SpamAssassin. This method can allow for spam to be filtered or deleted.

The procmail developers have built a mailing list manager called SmartList on top of procmail.

Procmail is an early example of a mail filtering tool and language. It is a data-driven programming language, similar to earlier line-oriented languages such as sed and AWK.

== Operation ==

procmail reads mail messages given to it on standard input, delivering or otherwise dispositioning each one. procmail is typically not invoked directly by the user. Rather, some other mail program will call upon procmail to deliver a message according to the user&#x27;s wishes. Message transfer agents (MTAs), such as Sendmail or Postfix), can be configured to use procmail to deliver all mail. A mail retrieval agent such as fetchmail can invoke procmail as needed. The companion tool &quot;formail&quot; allows procmail to be applied to mail already in a mailbox.

procmail&#x27;s behavior is controlled by a config file (by default, in the user&#x27;s home directory) containing one or more &quot;recipes&quot;, read in order. Each recipe consists of a &quot;mode&quot;, zero or more &quot;conditions&quot;, and an &quot;action&quot;.

Conditions are usually extended regular expressions, although there are other forms. A recipe&#x27;s action is taken only if all the conditions match (logical AND). If no conditions is given, the recipe is unconditional and the action always runs.

The action specifies what is to be done with the message, such as deliver it to a particular mailbox, or discard it. A recipe and its action can be &quot;delivering&quot; or &quot;non-delivering&quot;. Processing of a given message stops with the first delivering recipe (unless the recipe&#x27;s mode flag specifies otherwise).

== Example ==

A simple config file might look like this:

 MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
 DEFAULT=$MAILDIR/inbox
 :0:
 * ^List-Id: .*&lt;foo-announce@lists.example.com&gt;
 foo-announce

The above routes mail from a hypothetical mailing list to a separate mailbox called , while delivering all other mail to the mailbox, both located under the directory.

== Criticism ==

By default, procmail will &quot;bounce&quot; undeliverable mail back to the sender, or discard it entirely. A mistake in the config file can result in all mail being rejected or discarded.

The configuration file format is sometimes regarded as cryptic.

procmail is not well-suited for processing mail involving Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME). It cannot decode or recognize MIME-specific headers or international characters.

For approximately ten years, procmail was not maintained, and multiple serious security vulnerabilities were discovered in the intervening time span (since fixed).

<text>The Bard&#x27;s Tale is a fantasy role-playing video game designed and programmed by Michael Cranford for the Apple II. It was produced by Interplay Productions in 1985 and distributed by Electronic Arts. The game was ported to the Commodore 64, Apple IIGS, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Amiga, Atari ST, MS-DOS, Mac, and NES. It spawned &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; series of games and books. The earliest editions of the game used a series title of &quot;Tales of the Unknown&quot;, but this title was dropped for later ports of &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; and subsequent games in the series.

In August 2018, a remastered version was released for Windows, followed by the Xbox One release in 2019.

==Plot==

The following text from the box cover summarizes the premise:

Long ago, when magic still prevailed, the evil wizard Mangar the Dark threatened a small but harmonious country town called Skara Brae. Evil creatures oozed into Skara Brae and joined his shadow domain. Mangar froze the surrounding lands with a spell of Eternal Winter, totally isolating Skara Brae from any possible help. Then, one night, the town militiamen all disappeared.

The future of Skara Brae hung in the balance. And who was left to resist? Only a handful of unproven young Warriors, junior Magic Users, a couple of Bards barely old enough to drink, and some out of work Rogues.

You are there. You are the leader of this ragtag group of freedom fighters. Luckily you have a Bard with you to sing your glories, if you survive. For this is the stuff of legends. And so the story begins...

In the game, the player forms a group of up to six characters. Game progress is made through advancing the characters so that they are powerful enough to defeat the increasingly dangerous foes and monsters in the dungeons, obtaining certain items relevant to solving the overall quest, and obtaining information.

The fictional town of Skara Brae consists of 30x30 map tiles containing either buildings or streets (plus gates and magical guardian statues blocking certain streets). Access to one tower in the northeastern and southwestern city corner each is blocked by locked gates. The main city gates, which open to the west, are blocked by snow and remain impassable throughout the game. One street seems to lead south endlessly, by actually teleporting the party back to its beginning upon reaching the portion where the city walls would be.

Certain buildings within the city are special, such as the Adventurer&#x27;s Guild, Garth&#x27;s Equipment Shoppe, the Review Board (which is unmarked and must be found first, and is the only place where characters can advance in experience levels), various taverns and temples, and the dungeons. The latter are mazes of various kinds—cellars, sewers, catacombs, or fortresses—full of monsters and riddles, some guarded by magical statues that come to life to attack trespassing player parties.

# The first dungeon is the Wine Cellar (1 level) of a tavern, which turns out to be connected to the Sewers of Skara Brae (3 levels) that in turn feature an exit that leads to the otherwise inaccessible southwestern corner of the city where Mangar&#x27;s Tower, the final dungeon, is located. The tower cannot be entered without a key, however. In the sewers, numerous hints are found, including the name of the Mad God. Finding the Wine Cellar requires the party to order some wine at a specific tavern. There was a hint to this in the manual (&quot;Hint: The first dungeon is the wine cellar of the only tavern in town which serves wine. It&#x27;s on Rakhir Street&quot;). However, this hint was not present in the manual included with the C64 release of the game. Upon ordering wine, the party is sent by the bartender to his cellar to fetch a bottle themselves. It is not actually possible within the game to obtain a bottle of wine, nor is it required to proceed.
# The undead-infested Catacombs (3 levels) beneath the temple of the Mad God, accessible only if his name is known (the player must type the password to enter). On the lowest level, a Spectre must be defeated to obtain an eye.
# If they possess the eye, a statue of the Mad God in Baron Harkyn&#x27;s Castle (3 levels) will teleport the party to the (otherwise inaccessible) northeastern area of Skara Brae where the next dungeon is located; however, it is not required to proceed to the next dungeon immediately. If weakened too much from the fighting in the castle, the party may elect to leave the area via one-way portals instead at this point and return to the city and the Adventurer&#x27;s Guild.
# Kylearan&#x27;s Tower (1 level) can only be reached through the teleporter in Harkyn&#x27;s Castle, requiring any party who wishes to enter to fight through the castle&#x27;s three levels first. Kylearan the Archmage awaits the party at the conclusion of his tower maze and turns out to be friendly. He gives the party an access key to Mangar&#x27;s Tower, the final dungeon, but they still have to circumvent the locked gates around the tower by going through the Sewers.
# Still reachable only via the Sewers at this point in the game, Mangar&#x27;s Tower (5 levels) is the final dungeon that has to be overcome to reach Mangar and slay him, provided the party has acquired several items in the other dungeons which are required to best him. At one point within the tower, the party can acquire a key that will allow them to access Mangar&#x27;s Tower and Kylearan&#x27;s Tower from the city directly thenceforward, without having to move through the Sewers or Harkyn&#x27;s Castle, respectively.

==Gameplay==

&quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; is a straightforward dungeon crawl. The objective is to gain experience and advance characters&#x27; skills through (mostly) random combat with enemies and monsters. This is done while exploring maze-like dungeons, solving occasional puzzles and riddles, and finding or buying better weapons, armor, and other equipment.

When beginning the game, the player may create up to six player characters, chosen from among the following classes: bard, hunter, monk, paladin, rogue, warrior, magician, and conjurer. The classes sorcerer and wizard are available to experienced conjurers and magicians. On some platforms, the player can import previously created characters from &quot;Wizardry&quot; and/or &quot;Ultima III&quot;, which was somewhat revolutionary at the time of the game&#x27;s release.

Of particular innovation to the genre was the bard, whose magical songs functioned like long-lasting spells and affected the player&#x27;s party in various ways—such as strengthening their armor, or increasing their attack speed. A number of obligatory puzzles in the game were unsolvable without the use of bard songs. Each bard song triggered corresponding music while he played (some classical, some original).

Magic users were allowed to change classes permanently. The game manual describes a magic user who has mastered all spells from all four classes as &quot;an Archmage, the most powerful being in the world of The Bard&#x27;s Tale.&quot; However, Archmage status had no effect on gameplay other than simply having all spells available.

Casting one of the 85 magic user spells consisted of typing a four-letter code found only in the printed game manual. However, when using a mouse (in the DOS, Amiga, and Macintosh versions), the full names of the spells would appear in a list to choose from.

Combat is turn-based, described in text rather than shown graphically; there is no notion of moving characters around on a map during combat. Cash and experience points are distributed evenly to all surviving party members after a particular encounter is won.

==Cluebook==
Publisher Electronic Arts published a cluebook for the game in 1986 () that added some original characters and background information to the game&#x27;s setting. Written by T.L. Thompson, it purports to be an in-universe document that one Pellis, who seems to be an influential individual working against Mangar behind the scenes, entrusts to an unnamed friend who has just come of age: implicitly, the player (party).

It is the journal of Lord Garrick, viscount of Skara Brae&#x27;s sister city Hamelon. Trapped in Skara Brae by Mangar&#x27;s spell, Lord Garrick and his party of servants and associates (including Corfid op Orfin the Bard, Ghaklah the Magician, Isli the Paladin, Soriac the Archmage, and the otherwise unnamed &quot;last of the great sage-sorcerors&quot;) take it upon themselves to rid Skara Brae of Mangar&#x27;s influence. The journal narrates how they navigate the dungeons and solve the puzzles until, one step short of actually confronting Mangar, they find that crucial items were stolen by the party&#x27;s Rogue when he had abandoned them. Soriac prepares a spell that will allow Isli to escape and give the journal to Pellis, but is also thought to rent from the fabric of time everything they have accomplished, and will consume Isli as well as it burn itself out.

==Development==
Michael Cranford developed the concept, design, and programming of &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; and its successor game (&quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale II: The Destiny Knight&quot;), with additional design by Brian Fargo (the founder of Interplay) and Roe Adams III. David Lowery designed the graphics, Lawrence Holland composed the music, and Joe Ybarra served as producer. Cranford stated that most of the game design was based on his and Fargo&#x27;s &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; gaming experiences. Cranford and Fargo tried to improve on previous games of the genre in many areas including graphics and sound, with Cranford pointing to the &quot;Apple&quot; version of as an example of a game that fell short in his judgement.

Cranford is a devout Christian. He included references to Jesus in &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot;, and all but one of the city names in &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale II&quot; are taken from the New Testament. After a falling-out with Brian Fargo, he was not involved in &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale III&quot; and decided to go back to college to study philosophy and theology instead.

Cranford stated that they used a consultant during game development who suggested various ideas, including the city name &quot;Skara Brae&quot;, which was also used in &quot;Ultima IV&quot;—a surprise discovery after that game&#x27;s release due to the consultant&#x27;s work on &quot;Ultima IV&quot; as well. Cranford noted that they did not use the other ideas as the similarities could have been problematic.

Rebecca Heineman, who worked at Interplay at the time (then as Bill &quot;Burger&quot; Heineman), is credited in the game&#x27;s manual for the &quot;data compressing routines that allowed &quot;[Cranford]&quot; to pack so much graphics and animation&quot;, and according to herself also wrote development tools for the game such as a graphic editor and all ports to other platforms. Heineman became openly critical of Cranford in later years, saying in an interview that Cranford, after doing some last bugfixes, held the game&#x27;s final version &quot;hostage&quot; to force Brian Fargo to sign a publishing contract that contained a clause by which the sequel game (&quot;The Destiny Knight&quot;) would be Cranford&#x27;s alone. Brian Fargo confirmed this, but still defended Cranford.

Cranford in turn called Heineman&#x27;s words &quot;disparaging slant&quot; and &quot;fiction&quot;, noting that Heineman (&quot;a storyteller with an agenda&quot;) at the time was (paraphrased) a loner who &quot;sat isolated in a cubicle in the back corner of the room&quot;, wasn&#x27;t involved in the company&#x27;s business operations, nor deeply involved in &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot;, and therefore would not know all the details. As far as he (Cranford) could remember the situation, Brian Fargo would not produce a written contract for the game until near the very end of the development, and then only under pressure from Cranford withholding the final product. When he finally did, the contract was not what Cranford thought they had verbally agreed on when he had started working on the project, nor something he felt he could or would have agreed to at the onset. Although a compromise was found, Fargo asked Cranford to leave the company after &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale II: The Destiny Knight&quot; was finished. The experience contributed to Cranford walking away from game development to pursue a different career. Cranford said he later apologized to Fargo after learning that the attorney who had represented him had misrepresented several other cases to his clients and had apparently misled him into assuming the worst.

Cranford, Fargo, and Heineman have all since stated that they hold no grudges against each other over something that occurred when they were in their early twenties. Cranford and Fargo remain friends. When Fargo, through his firm inXile Entertainment, started making &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale IV: Barrows Deep&quot; on the original game&#x27;s 30th anniversary, Cranford was invited to join the project and did contribute, while Heineman offered to create a &#x27;remastered&#x27; edition of the original three games for modern operating systems (see below).

==Reception ==
===Critical reception===

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s Scorpia in 1985 described &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; as &quot;not to be missed!&quot; In 1993 she criticized the game&#x27;s starting difficulty and single save location, but stated that it had &quot;many points of interest, particularly in the puzzles, and is definitely a game worth getting&quot;. The game was reviewed in 1986 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #116 by Hartley and Pattie Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers rated the game well, concluding that &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale, a game of high adventure ... is one we recommend for your software library.&quot; The game was revisited in &quot;Dragon&quot; #120. In a subsequent column, the reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars.

Calling the Commodore 64 version wondrous, &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot; in 1986 stated that while the game&#x27;s plot and gameplay did not vary from the norm, &quot;its depth of concept and brilliance of execution&quot; did. Praising the complex magic system, the magazine concluded that &quot;the greatest danger is not Mangar—it&#x27;s the likelihood that you&#x27;ll never be able to tear yourself away from this masterpiece of a game&quot;. &quot;Compute!&quot; in 1987 called the Apple IIGS version &quot;unquestionably the most graphically stunning product I have seen on any Apple computer&quot;. The ZX Spectrum version of &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot;, released in 1988, was favorably received. &quot;CRASH&quot; said that &quot;the Skara Brae environment is so complex and involves so many different factors that it&#x27;s hard not to get completely enthralled in your quest&quot; and rated it at 86%. &quot;Sinclair User&quot; rated it at 89%, but noted that it would not appeal to general gameplayers, saying that &quot;&quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; will enthrall diehard pixie fans [...] but there&#x27;s too much text, and not enough graphics and animation, to convert the uncommitted.&quot; &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; were similarly positive about the game, rating it 9/10.

&quot;Macworld&quot; reviewed the Macintosh version of &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot;, praising the music and gameplay, calling it a &quot;Nice combination of problem solving, combat, and exploration&quot;, but criticizing the monochrome graphics and repetitive gameplay, the latter largely directed towards frequent combat.

The Commodore 64 version of &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; was given a &#x27;Sizzler&#x27; award and rated at 94% by Zzap!64 magazine, in the 1986 Christmas Special edition. Reviewer Sean Masterson called it &quot;the best RPG on the Commodore&quot;. In 1993, &quot;Commodore Force&quot; ranked the game at number 13 on its list of the top 100 Commodore 64 games.

When reviewing its sequel in 1988, &quot;Ahoy!&#x27;s AmigaUser&quot; described &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; as &quot;the all-time classic&quot;. With a score of 7.49 out of 10, that year &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; was among the first members of the &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; Hall of Fame, honoring those games rated highly over time by readers. In 1990 the game received the seventh-highest number of votes in a survey of readers&#x27; &quot;All-Time Favorites&quot;. In 1996, the magazine named &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; the 89th best game ever.

===Commercial performance===
&quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; was very successful, becoming the best-selling computer RPG of the 1980s at 407,000 copies. It was the first non-&quot;Wizardry&quot; computer role-playing game to challenge the &quot;Ultima&quot; series&#x27; sales, especially to Commodore 64 users who could not play &quot;Wizardry&quot; (a Commodore version did not appear until 1987, with inferior graphics to that of &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot;). By 1993, &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; series had sold over a million copies.

==Legacy==
===Sequels===
&quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; was both a best-seller and a critical success, and produced two official sequels and a &quot;Construction Set&quot; in its time.

*&quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale II: The Destiny Knight&quot; (1986)
*&quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale III: Thief of Fate&quot; (1988)
*&quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale Construction Set&quot; (1991)

A compilation of all three classic &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; games, entitled &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale Trilogy&quot;, was released for DOS by Electronic Arts in 1990.

According to programmer Rebecca Heineman, the name of the overall series was to be &quot;Tales of the Unknown&quot;, and the three games were to be entitled &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;The Archmage&#x27;s Tale&quot;, and &quot;The Thief&#x27;s Tale&quot;. This is supported by the cover art of the original &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; release, which proclaimed the game as &quot;&quot;Tales of the Unknown&quot;, Volume I.&quot; However, the immense popularity of the first game prompted Electronic Arts to re-brand the series under the more well-known name. Michael Cranford, however, stated that an Electronic Arts agent they worked with had come up with the city name (Skara Brae, named after a real-life settlement in prehistoric Orkney) and the game&#x27;s title, &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; (from originally: &quot;Tale of the Scarlet Bard&quot;), and that &quot;The Destiny Knight&quot; was never going to be called &quot;The Archmage&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

What was originally going to be &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale IV&quot; became an unrelated game called &quot;Dragon Wars&quot; (1989) at a very late point in its development process, due to rights issues after developer Interplay parted ways with publisher Electronic Arts. The game&#x27;s name and storyline were changed to disassociate it from the Bard&#x27;s Tale series.

In 2003, Brian Fargo (who created maps for the first two &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; games and directed the third) left Interplay Entertainment and began a new game development company named InXile Entertainment. In 2004, they released their first game, also titled &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot;, an unrelated, console-style, top-down, action RPG which pokes fun at traditional, fantasy, and role-playing game tropes as in those found throughout the original &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot;. It was not a proper sequel to the classic series, nor was it connected in any respect apart from the title and location: the story takes place on the Orkney Mainland, where the ruins of real-world Skara Brae lie. Although a legal loophole allowed InXile to use the &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; name, and the company had evidently planned to incorporate more elements of the original games, Electronic Arts still owned the original trademarks for the &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; series itself, and InXile was not legally allowed to use any of the plot, characters, or locations featured in the original trilogy in their 2004 game.

In May 2015, Fargo announced that he was planning to develop and a sequel funded through crowdfunding on Kickstarter, &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale IV&quot;. The game, which was released in 2018, continues the storyline of the original trilogy but has significantly changed gameplay.

&quot;The Mage&#x27;s Tale&quot; was published by InXile in 2017 as a spinoff game using virtual reality technology. It was developed concurrently with &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale IV&quot;.

===Remastered Edition===
During the Kickstarter campaign to create a proper fourth installment to the series, inXile partnered with Rebecca Heineman and her company Olde Sküül to remaster the original trilogy for modern personal computers running mac OS and Windows (instead of the emulated versions offered by inXile). After reaching an impasse in development, Olde Sküül and inXile agreed to transfer the project to Krome Studios. Krome Studios and inXile released the remastered edition on August 14, 2018, as part of the remastered &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Trilogy&quot;.

The Remastered Edition essentially re-wrote the original games, keeping only the storyline and gameplay design but little if any of the original game code. Graphics, sound, and user interface were updated to modern standards, various bugs were fixed, and a unified authoritative gameplay was devised when it turned out that there were significant differences not only between parts I, II, and III of the original trilogy (such as the number of characters in the party or spells being available at different levels, or not available at all, in different installments), but also between ports of the same game. Some content was added, including female character portraits and (inconsequential) references to the Bard&#x27;s Tale IV storyline.

The remastered edition of the original trilogy was released for Xbox One on August 13, 2019. This followed the acquisition of inXile Entertainment by Microsoft. The collection supports Xbox Play Anywhere.

===Novels===
A series of novels based on &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; were published by Baen Books during the 1990s. Although the books had little in common with the storyline of the games, their existence is a testament to how influential the &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; brand had become. They include:

#&quot;Castle of Deception&quot;, by Mercedes Lackey and Josepha Sherman (1992, )
#&quot;Fortress of Frost and Fire&quot;, by Mercedes Lackey and Ru Emerson (1993, )
#&quot;Prison of Souls&quot;, by Mercedes Lackey and Mark Shepherd (1994, )
#&quot;The Chaos Gate&quot;, by Josepha Sherman (1994, )
#&quot;Thunder of the Captains&quot;, by Holly Lisle and Aaron Allston (1996, )
#&quot;Wrath of the Princes&quot;, by Holly Lisle and Aaron Allston (1997, )
#&quot;Escape from Roksamur&quot;, by Mark Shepherd (1997, )
#&quot;Curse of the Black Heron&quot;, by Holly Lisle (1998, )

While they are listed here in the order they were published, some books in the series connect more than others, such as &quot;Castle of Deception&quot; and &quot;The Chaos Gate&quot;, &quot;Prison of Souls&quot; and &quot;Escape from Roksamur&quot;, and &quot;Thunder of the Captains&quot; and &quot;Wrath of the Princes&quot;.

<text>The Santa Clara Valley (Spanish: &quot;Valle de Santa Clara&quot;) is a geologic trough in Northern California that extends south–southeast from San Francisco to Hollister. The longitudinal valley is bordered on the west by the Santa Cruz Mountains and on the east by the Diablo Range; the two coastal ranges meet south of Hollister. The San Francisco Bay borders the valley to the north, and fills much of the northern third of the valley. The valley floor is an alluvial plain that formed in the graben (tectonic depression) between the San Andreas Fault to the west and the Hayward and Calaveras faults to the east.
Within the valley and surrounding the bay on three sides are the urban communities of San Mateo County, Santa Clara County, and Alameda County, while the narrow southern reaches of the valley extend into rural San Benito County to Hollister. In practical terms, the central portion of the Santa Clara Valley is often considered by itself, contained entirely within Santa Clara County.

The valley, named after the Spanish Mission Santa Clara, was for a time known as the Valley of Heart&#x27;s Delight for its high concentration of orchards, flowering trees, and plants. Until the 1960s it was the largest fruit-producing and packing region in the world, with 39 canneries. The growing high-tech industry in the 1960s transformed the area from farmland to densely populated cities, and it became referred to as the [[Silicon Valley]].

==Overview==
Once primarily agricultural because of its highly fertile soil, Santa Clara Valley is now largely urbanized, although its far southern reaches south of Gilroy remain agrarian. Few traces of its agricultural past can still be found, but the Santa Clara Valley American Viticultural Area remains a large wine-making region. It was one of the first commercial wine-producing regions in California (and possibly the United States), utilizing high-quality French varietal vines imported from France.

The northern end of the Santa Clara Valley is at San Francisco, and the southern end is south of Hollister. The valley is bounded by the Santa Cruz Mountains on the southwest, which separate the valley from the Pacific Ocean, and by the Diablo Range on the northeast. The valley is approximately long by wide. Its largest city is San Jose. Santa Clara Valley has a Mediterranean semi-arid climate.

Joseph S. Diller, a geologist, observed in 1915 that a &quot;notable peculiarity&quot; of the Santa Clara Valley is that &quot;it is divided transversely by a scarcely noticeable soil-covered divide.&quot; The northern portion is drained northward by various rivers and creeks into San Francisco Bay. The southern portion of the valley is drained southward by Llagas Creek into the Pajaro River, which in turn flows westward to Monterey Bay. As one travels across the valley floor, &quot;the alluvial plain is continuous across the divide.&quot; The summit of the transverse divide is about two miles from the former town of Madrone at an elevation of , but the alluvial plain is so continuous that most travelers are unaware they are crossing between two drainage basins.

==History==
The earliest known inhabitants on the Santa Clara Valley are the Ohlone people, who had eight distinct languages and tribes in the coastal region. Mission Santa Clara de Asís, which had control over a vast tract of land stretching from Palo Alto to Gilroy, was founded by Franciscans in 1777. San Jose was California&#x27;s first town and was also founded in 1777 by Spain as an agricultural pueblo. There were 66 original settlers. In Spanish and Mexican times the land was devoted to cattle, as was most of California. Following the Mexican–American War San Jose was briefly the capital of California. The influx of Americans resulted in relocation of many of the native Mexican and Indian people of San Jose to the mission at Santa Clara, which had been under control of Jesuits from 1850; they founded Santa Clara University there in 1851. In 1860, as an American town, the population of San Jose was 4,579, with cattle ranching still the main agricultural activity. For a time wheat became the main crop, but in the 1870s fruit gradually became the main crop and processing of fruit by drying or canning the predominant industry. The railroad reached San Jose in 1860.

===The Valley of Heart&#x27;s Delight===

The valley with its scenic beauty, mild climate, and thousands of acres of blooming fruit trees was known as &quot;The Valley of Heart&#x27;s Delight&quot;. Various fruit cooperatives were formed in the area to deal with economic issues, including the California Fruit Union (founded in 1883) and the Santa Clara County Fruit Exchange (founded in 1892). Prunes were a major crop, with the valley was producing the majority of prunes in California by 1900 and shipped internationally. Water was supplied from an artesian aquifer and when the water table dropped, wells were pumped. Many orchards were small with housing and fruit growing in a dispersed pattern. By the 1920s and 1930s, the agricultural and horticultural industries were doing well in the valley and included 18 canneries, 13 dried-fruit packing houses, and 12 fresh-fruit and vegetable shipping firms, and they were shipping internationally. Del Monte and Sunsweet are two brands which originated in the Santa Clara Valley.

The need for workers greatly exceeded the local population and in the nineteenth century, Chinese and Japanese immigrants met that need. Toward the end of the nineteenth century many Italians and other immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe came to the valley and worked in the orchards and canneries. During the 20th century there were Filipino immigrants and increasing numbers of immigrants from Mexico who during World War II became the dominant agricultural workforce. The town of San Jose was dominated by its business community, which was in part composed of Irish Catholics, who had a self-contained social life which did not include immigrant labor. There was marked prejudice against Asians, particularly Chinese, who gradually left the valley.

===The Great Depression===

Deflation and overproduction severely hurt the orchards and packers of the Santa Clara Valley during the Great Depression. Bankrupt farmers from the Dust Bowl, the Okies, made the trek to California&quot;.&quot; Desperate to feed their families, they joined a workforce that was itself impacted by unemployment. The growers, with record low prices and surplus supply, could pay little. Labor organizers and goon squads battled in the labor camps. Woody Guthrie&#x27;s songs were on the radio and he wrote a regular column in the San Francisco-based &quot;The Daily People&#x27;s World&quot; for the workers. San Francisco had a strong labor union tradition which thrived in Santa Clara County. During the &quot;March Inland&quot; organizing drive the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) backed the Cannery and Agricultural Workers&#x27; Industrial Union (CAWIU), a Communist-controlled union headquartered in San Jose, which had considerable success organizing farm and cannery workers in the Santa Clara Valley and elsewhere in California until it was suppressed and its leaders jailed in 1934 by the State of California following sustained attacks by business and political forces which, in San Jose, resulted in an atmosphere of terror (the low point of which was a public lynching tacitly supported by James Rolph, the Governor of California). The canneries, with a segregated seasonal work force of white women, were eventually organized, at first by an AFL-affiliated company union, but one which gradually evolved, thanks to rank and file efforts, into a union which genuinely represented cannery workers.

===War and industry===
The fruit industry gradually recovered, and by the early 1940s, prosperity returned to the valley. Wartime production associated with World War II brought industry to the valley such as building of marine engines for Liberty ships by the Joshua Hendy Iron Works, now Northrop Grumman Marine Systems in Sunnyvale; landing craft were built by Food Machinery Corporation, which later built the M113 armored personnel carrier, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and the XR311 at its facility in Santa Clara; and an IBM factory began manufacturing punch cards in San Jose in 1943.

About 1,000 Japanese were interned, losing substantial property. Wartime production drew workers, including women, from the orchards and canneries; they were replaced by Mexican Americans from Texas and California and by Mexican braceros. Neighborhoods in East San Jose, such as the Meadowfair district, became barrios.

The Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missile was built during the Cold War by Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Division in Sunnyvale for the United States Navy, while Northrop Grumman Marine Systems built the launch tubes and propulsion systems. For the most part, the defense industry and traditional electronics manufacturers, with the exception of IBM, in the Santa Clara Valley were unionized, mainly by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and Teamsters. The United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, a communist dominated union, but friendly to minority and women workers, gradually lost its place during the McCarthy era.

===Silicon Valley===

In the 1950s, the first transistor industries were established in the area. Led by Stanford University, the lower San Francisco Peninsula became a global high-tech hub known as Silicon Valley. The name refers to silicon, the most common semiconductor used to produce microchips and other electronic devices.

The borders of Silicon Valley have been variously defined. Most observers include the entirety of Santa Clara County and the southern portions of San Mateo and Alameda counties, while others extend the region northwest to San Francisco or northeast to San Ramon.

===San Jose===
In 1950, Dutch Hamann was appointed city manager of San Jose. Hamann&#x27;s boosterism was supported by Joe Ridder, publisher of the &quot;San Jose Mercury&quot;. In power until 1969, Hamann created a master plan for San Jose and embarked on a program of annexation that increased the area of San Jose from 17 square miles to 136.7 square miles. The main bargaining chip was the superior sewage system built to handle cannery waste. To overcome resistance by school districts, who otherwise would have lost their tax base, annexed areas were allowed to maintain independent school districts. This resulted in some parts of the city, such as East San Jose, having low-quality segregated school systems with a low tax base while school systems in other parts of San Jose had an ample tax base and high-quality schools. The population of San Jose increased from 95 thousand in 1950 to 446 thousand in 1970. There were critics: Santa Clara County Planning Director Karl Belser, who opposed urban sprawl, commented, &quot;Perhaps the only use we will ever find for the hydrogen bomb will be to erase this great mistake from the face of the earth.&quot; Housing for each additional 1000 people took 257 acres of land. In more recent years, San Jose and the Santa Clara Valley have suffered from extensive droughts in California to the extent that some residents may run out of household water by the summer of 2022.

===Schools===
Funding for public schools in upscale communities in the Santa Clara Valley is often supplemented by grants from private foundations set up for that purpose and funded by local residents. Schools in less favorable demographics must depend on state funding.

==Cities and towns==

Cities and towns in the Santa Clara Valley include (in alphabetical order):

Because technology companies have spread out from Silicon Valley, Fremont and Newark, even though they are not in Santa Clara County, are often included in discussions about Silicon Valley, or, in the case of Fremont, referred to as the &quot;Gateway to the Silicon Valley&quot; (a title also claimed occasionally by San Jose, Union City, and several other locations). Similarly, Palo Alto, while in Santa Clara County and considered part of Silicon Valley, is on the San Francisco Peninsula.

==Geology==
Santa Clara Valley was created by the sudden growth of the Santa Cruz Mountains and the Diablo Range during the later Cenozoic era. This was a period of intense mountain building in California when the folding and thrusting of the Earth&#x27;s crust, combined with active volcanism, gave shape to the present state of California. Hence, Santa Clara Valley is a structural valley, created by mountain building, as opposed to an erosional valley, which is a valley that has undergone the wearing away of the Earth&#x27;s surface by natural agents. The underlying geology of the Santa Cruz Mountains was also formed by the sediment of the ancient seas, where marine shale points to Miocene origin. Today, evidence of this is still found in the Santa Cruz Mountains, where shark&#x27;s teeth and the remains of maritime life are still found as high as Scotts Valley, a city nestled in the mountains. The highest peak on the Santa Cruz Mountain Range side of the valley is Loma Prieta at 3,790 feet. The highest peak in the Diablo Range side of the valley is Mount Hamilton, specifically Copernicus Peak at 4,370 feet elevation. It is the highest peak in Santa Clara County.

The valley is a graben between the San Andreas and Hayward faults.

===Quicksilver mine===
During the 19th century, 37,388 metric tons of mercury were extracted from the New Almaden mine south of San Jose and northeast of Santa Cruz. The area, closed for many years, resulted in pollution of the Guadalupe River and South San Francisco Bay. After intermittent mining operations finally ceased in the 20th century, the area was purchased by Santa Clara County to be used as a park and was designated a National Historic Landmark.

==Climate==
The climate of the Santa Clara Valley in California is a Mediterranean climate with warm, very dry summers and mild, fairly rainy winters. Today, the Valley attracts many people from the East Coast with its warm and sunny climate. The Santa Clara Valley receives on average 330 sunny days per year. The northern areas of the valley (such as Palo Alto or Mountain View) have greater marine influences with temperatures rarely rising above while in the southern areas and near the mountains (such as Los Gatos, Morgan Hill, or Gilroy) the temperature frequently exceeds in the summer months. Winter is the rainy season, but still quite sunny. Winter highs range from while lows range from . Summer highs range from and summer lows range from .

The record high for the Santa Clara Valley was recorded in Los Gatos on June 9, 2000, with a temperature of and the record low was recorded in Gilroy on December 23, 1990, with a temperature of . Temperatures drop below on average of 17 days per year, below freezing on average of 4 days per year and below on average of 0 days per year (none).

More recently, extensive droughts in California, further complicated by drainage of the local Anderson reservoir for seismic repairs, have strained the Valley&#x27;s water security.

<text>Ella Mae Morse (September 12, 1924 – October 16, 1999) was an American singer of popular music whose 1940s and 1950s recordings mixing jazz, blues, and country styles influenced the development of rock and roll. Her 1942 recording of &quot;Cow-Cow Boogie&quot; with Freddie Slack and His Orchestra gave Capitol Records its first gold record. In 1943, her single &quot;Get On Board, Little Chillun&quot;, also with Slack, charted in what would soon become the R&amp;B charts, making her one of the first white singers to do so. Morse stopped recording in 1957 but continued to perform and tour into the 1990s. In 1960, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Career==
Morse was born in Mansfield, Texas. She was hired by Jimmy Dorsey when she was 14 years old. In 1942, at the age of 17, she joined Freddie Slack&#x27;s band, with whom, that same year she recorded &quot;Cow-Cow Boogie (Cuma-Ti-Yi-Yi-Ay)&quot;, the first gold record released by Capitol Records. &quot;Mr. Five by Five&quot; was also recorded by Morse with Slack, and became a hit record in 1942 (Capitol 115). She also originated the wartime hit &quot;Milkman, Keep Those Bottles Quiet&quot;, which was later popularized by Nancy Walker in the 1944 film &quot;Broadway Rhythm&quot;.

In 1943, Morse began to record solo. She reached #1 in the R&amp;B chart with &quot;Shoo-Shoo Baby&quot; in December for two weeks. In the same year she performed &quot;Cow Cow Boogie&quot; in the film &quot;Reveille with Beverly&quot; and co-starred in Universal&#x27;s &quot;South of Dixie&quot;, &quot;Ghost Catchers&quot; with Olsen and Johnson, and &quot;How Do You Dooo?&quot;, a vehicle for radio&#x27;s &quot;Mad Russian&quot;, Bert Gordon. She sang in a wide variety of styles, and she had hits on both the U.S. pop and rhythm and blues charts. However, she never received the popularity of a major star.

The song &quot;Love Me or Leave Me&quot; as recorded by Morse was released by Capitol Records as catalog number 1922, with the flip side &quot;Blacksmith Blues&quot;, which became her biggest hit.

In 1946, &quot;House of Blue Lights&quot; by Freddie Slack and Morse, (written by Slack and Don Raye) saw them perform what was one of many of Raye&#x27;s songs picked up by black R&amp;B artists. Her biggest solo success was &quot;Blacksmith Blues&quot; in 1952, which sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. The same year her version of &quot;Down the Road a Piece&quot; appeared on Capitol with Slack again on piano accompaniment. Morse also recorded a version of &quot;Oakie Boogie&quot; for Capitol which reached #23 in 1952. Her version was one of the first songs arranged by Nelson Riddle.

Morse ceased recording in 1957, but continued performing until the early 1990s, under the new management of Alan Eichler, performing at such clubs as Michael&#x27;s Pub in New York, Ye Little Club in Beverly Hills, the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel&#x27;s Cinegrill and the Vine St. Bar and Grill. She appeared regularly at Disneyland for several years with the Ray McKinley Orchestra, and did a successful tour of Australia shortly before her final illness.

Her music career was profiled in Nick Tosches&#x27; 1984 book, &quot;The Unsung Heroes of Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll: The Birth of Rock in the Wild Years Before Elvis&quot;. She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1724 Vine Street. 

Her entire recorded body of work was issued in a deluxe box set by Bear Family Records and a rare live performance, &quot;Ella Mae Morse On Broadway&quot;, was released in 2011. 

==Musical style==
As Morse&#x27;s musical style blended jazz, blues, and country, she has sometimes been called the first rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll singer. A good example is her 1942 recording of the song &quot;Get On Board, Little Chillun&quot;, which, with strong gospel, blues, boogie, and jive sounds, was a genuine precursor to the later rockabilly/rock &#x27;n roll songs.
Her records sold well to both Caucasian and African-American audiences. As she was not well known at the time of her first solo hits, many people assumed she was African-American because of her &#x27;hip&#x27; vocal style and choice of material.

==Personal life==
In 1999, Morse died of respiratory failure in Bullhead City, Arizona, at age 75. She had six children from four marriages, several grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and a sister, Flo Handy, who was also a singer.

<text>The Octopus card (, is a reusable contactless stored value smart card for making electronic payments in online or offline systems in Hong Kong. Launched in September 1997 to collect fares for the territory&#x27;s mass transit system, it has grown into a widely used system for transport and other retail transactions in Hong Kong. It is also used for purposes such as recording school attendance and permitting building access. The cards are used by 98 percent of the population of Hong Kong aged 15 to 64 and the system handles more than 15 million transactions, worth over HK$220 million, every day.

The Octopus card system was the world&#x27;s second contactless smart card system, after the Korean Upass. It won the Chairman&#x27;s Award at the World Information Technology and Services Alliance&#x27;s 2006 Global IT Excellence Awards for, among other things, being the world&#x27;s leading complex automatic fare collection and contactless smart card payment system. Its success led to the development of similar systems elsewhere, including Navigo card in Paris, Oyster card in London, Opal card in New South Wales, and NETS FlashPay and EZ-Link in Singapore.

== History ==
When Hong Kong&#x27;s Mass Transit Railway (MTR) began operations in 1979, it used recirculating magnetic stripe cards as fare tickets. The Kowloon-Canton Railway (KCR) adopted the same magnetic cards in 1984. The Common Stored Value Ticket was a version that held a balance for use over multiple trips. In 1989, the Common Stored Value Ticket system was extended to Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) buses providing a feeder service to MTR and KCR stations, and to Citybus. It was also extended to a limited number of non-transport applications, such as transactions and payments at photo booths and for fast food vouchers.

In 1993, MTR Corporation announced it would move to use contactless smart cards. In 1994 it partnered with four other major transit companies in Hong Kong, Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, Kowloon Motor Bus, Citybus, and Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry, to create a joint-venture business, then known as Creative Star Limited.

After three years of trials, the Octopus card was launched on 1 September 1997. Three million cards were issued in the first three months. The system&#x27;s quick success was because MTR and KCR required all holders of Common Stored Value Tickets to replace them with Octopus cards within three months or have their tickets expire. Another reason was a coin shortage in Hong Kong in 1997. With the transfer of Hong Kong away from British rule, there was a belief that older Hong Kong coins embossed with Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s head would rise in value, so many people held on to them waiting for their value to increase.

The Octopus system was quickly adopted by other Creative Star partners. KMB reported that by 2000 most bus journeys were completed using an Octopus card. Boarding a bus in Hong Kong without using the Octopus card requires giving exact change, making it cumbersome compared to using the Octopus card. By November 1998, 4.6 million cards had been issued, and rising to 9 million by January 2002.

In 2000, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority granted a deposit-taking company licence to the operator. This increased the proportion of permitted non-transport–related Octopus card transactions from 15% of turnover to 50%. About HK$416 million was deposited in the Octopus system at any given time as of 2000.

On 6 November 2005, Octopus Cards Limited launched Octopus Rewards, a program that allows cardholders to earn rewards with participating merchants. Founding partners for the Octopus Rewards program included HSBC, UA Cinemas and Wellcome. The rewards are in the form of points, or &quot;reward dollars&quot;, stored on the card. The rate at which reward points are earned per dollar spent differs between merchants. Reward points can be redeemed as payment for purchases at partner merchants for at least HK$1 per reward dollar.

New cards with greater levels of security were launched in 2015. Holders of first generation cards could voluntarily replace their cards at an Octopus Service Point without charge. From January 2018, first generation cards started to become unusable.

In March 2024, Octopus Card Limited launched a version of the Octopus card with support for the China T-union network, allowing the holder to pay for public transport fares in 336 cities of Inland China. The card is topped up using HKD and automatically converted into RMB when taking non-Hong-Kong public transport.

== Etymologies and logo ==

The Cantonese name for the Octopus card, &quot;Baat Daaht Tùng&quot; (), translates literally as &quot;eight-arrived pass&quot;, where &quot;Baat Daaht&quot; may translate as &quot;reaching everywhere&quot;. Less literally, the meaning is taken as the &quot;go-everywhere pass&quot;. It was selected by the head of the MTR Corporation, the parent company of Octopus Cards Limited, in a naming competition in 1996. The number eight refers to the cardinal and ordinal directions, and the four-character idiom (), a common expression loosely translated as &quot;reachable in all directions&quot;. Eight is also considered a lucky number in Chinese culture, and the phrase can possibly be associated with the similar-sounding , which means &quot;getting wealthy&quot; () in Cantonese.

The English name &quot;Octopus card&quot; was also selected in the naming competition. It also references the number eight, since an octopus has eight tentacles. The logo used on the card features an infinity symbol.

== Card usage ==

The Octopus card was originally introduced for fare payment on the MTR; but usage quickly expanded to other retail businesses in Hong Kong. The card is now commonly used in most public transport, fast food restaurants, supermarkets, vending machines, convenience stores, photo booths, parking meters, car parks, and many other retails business where small payments are frequently made. Over 33 million Octopus cards are in circulation as of 2018, with the card being used by 99 per cent of Hong Kong residents.

Notable businesses that started accepting Octopus cards at an early stage included PARKnSHOP, Wellcome, Watsons, 7-Eleven, Starbucks, McDonald&#x27;s, and Circle K. Between June 2003 and November 2004, the Hong Kong Government replaced its 17,000 parking meters with an Octopus card–operated system. Octopus card was then the only accepted form of payment until 2021 when new meters were introduced that accepted contactless payment, Faster Payment System and QR code payment.

Octopus cards also double as access control cards in buildings and for school administrative functions. At certain office buildings, residential buildings, and schools, use of an Octopus card is required for entry.

=== Payments ===
Payments are made by holding the card against or within a few centimetres of an Octopus card reader. The reader acknowledges payment by emitting a beep, and displaying the amount deducted and the remaining balance of the card. The standard transaction time for readers used for public transport is 0.3 seconds, and for retailers&#x27; card readers is 1 second.

==== Public transport ====

When using the MTR heavy rail system, each passenger&#x27;s entry point is recorded and the appropriate fare based on distance travelled is deducted when they validate their cards again at the exit point.

The MTR usually charges less for journeys made using an Octopus card instead of conventional single-journey tickets. For example, the adult fare of a single journey from Chai Wan to Tung Chung is HK$25.7 with an Octopus card, and HK$28.5 with a single journey ticket. Other public transport operators also offer intermittent discounts for using Octopus cards on higher fares and round-trip transits on select routes.

==== Taxis ====
The first trial of using Octopus card readers in Hong Kong taxis started in June 2006 with the Yellow Taxi Group in the New Territories. It was reported on 30 October that eight of the twenty taxis participating in the trial had dropped out. Part of the reason was technicaldrivers needed to return to the office every day for accounting. Most taxi drivers in Hong Kong are self-employed and prefer to account their profit and rent on a daily basis, while Octopus transferred money through a bank after one working day, so drivers could be left over a weekend or longer waiting for their account to be reconciled. Installation and service fees are also a concern.

Wong Yu-ting, the managing director of the Yellow Taxi Group, wanted retailers to offer discounts to Octopus taxi passengers, but the Transport Department objected as taxi fare discount is illegal in Hong Kong.

In March 2018, Octopus Cards Limited announced plans to re-enter the taxi payment market with a new mobile app for taxi drivers. The mobile app is able to receive funds by tapping the passenger&#x27;s Octopus card to the device&#x27;s Near-field communication (NFC) reader, or by allowing passengers to scan a QR code.

In October 2020, Octopus Cards Limited launched Octopus Mobile POS, a more compact version of the Octopus reader to help taxi drivers and small- and medium-sized retailers accept cashless payments. The new Octopus Mobile POS, that works with the mobile app, was opportune during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it helped provide merchants customers with peace of mind regarding potential virus transmission. By July 2021, over 15,000 taxi drivers had installed Octopus Mobile POS.

==== Outside Hong Kong ====
In collaboration with China UnionPay, Octopus Cards Limited introduced Octopus card usage to two Fairwood restaurants in Shenzhen in August 2006. In 2008, five Café de Coral locations in Shenzhen also started accepting Octopus. Value cannot be reloaded to Octopus cards in Shenzhen, but the Automatic Add Value Service is available to automatically deduct money value from a customer&#x27;s credit card to reload an Octopus card. The two Fairwood restaurants in Shenzhen that were enabled for Octopus card payments are located at Luohu Commercial City and Shenzhen railway station. Shenzhen became the first city outside Hong Kong in which Octopus cards may be accepted as payment.

In Macau, the Octopus card was introduced in December 2006 when two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in the territory adopted its usage as payment. Similar to its usage in Shenzhen, an Octopus card may not be reloaded in Macau, and the currency exchange rate between the Macanese pataca and the Hong Kong dollar when using an Octopus card is MOP1:HKD1. The two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in Macau that adopted the Octopus card for payment are located at the Rua do Campo and the Sands Casino.

Shenzhen Tong cards are now widely used in Shenzhen instead, and a combined Shenzhen Tong – Hong Kong Octopus card is available, called the Hu Tong Xing, with RMB &amp; HKD in different purses. The Macau Pass is now widely used in Macau.

=== Balance enquiries, reloading and refunds ===
Spare coins can also be added on to Octopus cards at &quot;Coin Carts&quot;, a vehicle operated by Hong Kong Monetary Authority.

== Types of cards ==
There are two main types of Octopus card (&quot;On-Loan&quot; and &quot;Sold&quot;), and two less common types (&quot;Airport Express Tourist&quot; and &quot;MTR Airport Staff&quot;).

=== Main types of cards ===

==== On-Loan cards ====
On-Loan cards are issued for use in day-to-day functions, primarily for fare payment in transport systems. They are further classified into &quot;Child&quot;, &quot;Adult&quot;, &quot;Elder&quot;, and &quot;Personalised&quot; categories, with the first three based on age and different amounts of fare concession. With the exception of the &quot;Personalised&quot; cards, On-Loan cards are anonymous; no personal information, bank account, or credit card details are stored on the card, and no identification is required for the purchase of these cards. If an owner loses a card, only the stored value and the deposit of the card are lost. On-Loan Octopus cards may be purchased at all MTR stations, the KMB Customer Service Centre, New World First Ferry (NWFF) Octopus Service Centres, and the New World First Bus (NWFB) Customer Service Centre. A student on-loan Octopus Card was initially issued, but was discontinued in 2005.
=== Samsung Pay ===
Since 14 December 2017, the cardless Octopus, named &quot;Smart Octopus&quot;, is available with Samsung Pay, a mobile payment platform provided by Samsung. By using the phone&#x27;s NFC function and magnetic secure transmission (MST) technology, users can tap their selected Samsung devices on Octopus readers, paying in a similar way as a normal physical Octopus cards.

Users can choose to transfer their card data from an existing anonymous On-Loan Adult or Elder Octopus to the Smart Octopus. All card value and reward points are transferred and held in the Samsung Pay app. The physical card is then deactivated and can no longer be used. Users can also choose to purchase a new Adult or Elder Smart Octopus in the app.

Smart Octopus provides features like instant transaction notification and in-app top-up function. In-app top-ups initially incurred a 2.5% handling fee but this fee was removed in June 2020 when support for Apple Pay was launched.

=== Apple Pay ===
Since 2 June 2020, Octopus cards can be added to Apple Pay. As Octopus cards use FeliCa technology, only Apple Watch 3, iPhone 8, and subsequent model are supported. Octopus for Tourists was launched in August 2020.

Users can choose to create a virtual Octopus card inside Apple Pay by topping up with their loaded credit cards, or to transfer data from an existing physical Octopus card. It supports Apple Pay&#x27;s Express Transit function, which allows payments to be made from the iPhone or Apple Watch without needing to switch on the phone or authenticating the payment with Face ID, Touch ID, or password.

=== Huawei Pay ===
Since 9 December 2020, Octopus card can be added to Huawei Pay. But it can only be used on Huawei phones sold in Hong Kong, Macau and China

Users can download the Octopus app from Huawei AppGallery to purchase new Octopus cards or transfer physical Octopus cards. If users have a UnionPay credit card, they can also purchase new Octopus cards in Huawei Wallet.

== Technology ==
The Australia-based company ERG Group (now Vix Technology) was selected in 1994 to lead development of the Octopus project. It designed, built and installed the Octopus system. Operations, maintenance and development were undertaken by Octopus Cards Limited, and in 2005, it replaced the central transaction clearing house with its own system.

The Octopus card is the first major public transport system to use the Sony 13.56 MHz FeliCa radio frequency identification (RFID) chip. It is a contactless system, so users need only hold the card in close proximity to the reader. Data is transmitted at up to 212 kbit/s (the maximum speed for Sony FeliCa chips), compared to 9.6 kbit/s for other smart card systems like Mondex and Visa Cash. The card has a storage capacity of 1 to 64 kB, compared to 125 bytes provided by magnetic stripe cards.

Octopus pre-dates the ISO/IEC 14443 standards so uses a nonstandard RFID system. The operating range of the reader/writer is between 30 and 100 mm (1.2 and 3.9 in) depending on the model used.

Octopus is designed so that transactions are relayed for clearing on a store and forward basis, without any requirement for reader units to have realtime round-trip communications with a central database or computer. The stored data may be transmitted after hours, or in the case of offline mobile readers, may be retrieved by a hand held device, for example a Pocket PC.

In practice, different data collection mechanisms are used by different transport operators, depending on the nature of their business. The MTR equips its stations with local area networks that connect the components that deal with Octopus cardsturnstiles, Add Value Machines, value-checking machines and customer service terminals. Transactions from these stations are relayed to the MTR&#x27;s Kowloon Bay headquarters through a Frame Relay wide area network, and then on to the central clearing house system (CCHS). Similar arrangements are in place for retailers such as 7-Eleven. Handheld devices are used to scan offline mobile readers, including those installed on minibuses. Buses either use handheld devices or a wireless system, depending on operator.

=== Security ===
The Octopus card uses encryption for all airborne communication and performs mutual authentication between the card and reader based on the ISO 9798-2 three-pass mutual authentication protocol. In other words, data communications are only established when the card and reader have mutually authenticated based on a shared secret access key. This means that the security of the Octopus card system would be jeopardized should the access key be exposed. A stolen Octopus card reader could be used with stolen Octopus software, for example, to add value (up to HK$3,000) to any Octopus card without authorization. Nevertheless, as of 2003, the Octopus card and system had never been hacked.

Octopus card readers include a fail-safe that prevents them from initiating a transaction when more than one card is detected at a time. On 11 February 2009, &quot;Sing Tao Daily&quot; reported that the fail-safe has been abused for fare evasion through the railway station turnstile. Passengers were stacking four or more cards on the reader before breaking through the turnstile, deliberately triggering the fail-safe to avoid deduction of credit from their cards. If challenged they could blame a malfunction and present an Octopus card with a record of an unsuccessful transaction.

== Operator ==

The Octopus card system is owned and operated by Octopus Cards Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Octopus Holdings Limited. Founded as Creative Star Limited in 1994, it was renamed Octopus Cards Limited in 2002.

In January 2001, the shares of Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry were transferred to New World First Bus and New World First Ferry. In the same year, together with MTR Corporation, the company changed from non-profit making status to a profit making enterprise.

Due to the expansion of the company&#x27;s businesses, Octopus Holdings Limited was established in 2005 with Octopus Cards Limited restructured as a subsidiary. Being a payment business, Octopus Cards Limited is regulated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Octopus&#x27; non-payment businesses are not subjected to such regulation and are operated by other subsidiaries of Octopus Holdings Limited.

As of 2007, Octopus Holdings Limited was a joint-venture business owned by five transport companies in Hong Kong; 57.4% by the MTR Corporation, 22.1% by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, 12.4% by Kowloon Motor Bus, 5% by Citybus, and 3.1% by New World First Bus. The Government of Hong Kong owns 76.54% of the MTR Corporation (as of 31 December 2005) and wholly owns the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, so is the biggest effective shareholder of Octopus Holdings Limited, and of Octopus Cards Limited.

== Awards ==

The Octopus card is recognised internationally. It won the Chairman&#x27;s Award at the World Information Technology and Services Alliance&#x27;s 2006 Global IT Excellence Awards for being the world&#x27;s leading complex automatic fare collection and contactless smartcard payment system, and for innovative use of technology.

== Issues ==

=== EPS add-value glitch ===
In February 2007 it was found that when customers added value to their cards at self-service add-value points in MTR and Light rail stations, their bank accounts were debited even if the transactions had been cancelled. Octopus Cards Limited claimed that the fault was due to an upgrade of communication systems. Initially, two cases were reported. The company then announced that use Electronic Payment Services (EPS) at add-value service points would be suspended until further notice, and that it had started an investigation into the reasons for the problem.

On 27 July 2007 it was announced that faulty transactions had been traced back to 2000, and that a total of 3.7 million Hong Kong dollars had been wrongly deducted in 15,270 cases. The company reported that there might be cases prior to 2000, but that only the past seven years’ transactions were stored. The company stated it would co-operate with banks and EPS Company Limited, operator of Electronic Payment Services, to contact customers involved and arrange a refund within ten weeks.

On 21 December 2007 the company announced it would permanently cease all transactions using EPS because it could not guarantee such problems would not occur again.

=== Privacy abuse ===
On 15 July 2010, a former employee of the CIGNA insurance company claimed CIGNA purchased records for 2.4 million Octopus users. On 20 July, Octopus acknowledged selling customers&#x27; personal details to CIGNA and Card Protection Plan Limited, and started an internal review of their data practices. Octopus Holdings made 44 million Hong Kong dollars ($5.7M USD) over 4.5 years. Roderick Woo Bun, Hong Kong&#x27;s Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, gave radio interviews and called for transparent investigation, but his term expired at the end of July 2010. Allan Chiang Yam-wang was announced as the incoming Privacy Commissioner. This news was met with protests and international outrage, due to his prior history of privacy invasions involving cameras used to spy on employees at the Post Office, and disclosing hundreds of job applicants&#x27; personal data to corporations. Outgoing Privacy Commissioner Woo pledged to finish a preliminary report on the Octopus privacy abuse before his term ended, and called for a new law making it a criminal offence for companies to sell personal data.

=== Technology ===
As NFC and cardless payment are more popular in mainland China, some question the slow technology development of Octopus company. Among these commentaries, some suggest market monopoly and government attitude to Octopus are the contributing factor, as the social transportation subsidies are solely through the Octopus system. Octopus CEO Sunny Cheung stated that new technology would be launched in short period of time, such as QR code payment, integration of Octopus card with Samsung Pay and peer-to-peer lending.

<doc id="267625" wikidata="Q690661" url="?curid=267625" title="Nonprobability sampling">
<text>Nonprobability sampling is a form of sampling that does not utilise random sampling techniques where the probability of getting any particular sample may be calculated. 

Nonprobability samples are not intended to be used to infer from the sample to the general population in statistical terms. In cases where external validity is not of critical importance to the study&#x27;s goals or purpose, researchers might prefer to use nonprobability sampling. Researchers may seek to use iterative nonprobability sampling for theoretical purposes, where analytical generalization is considered over statistical generalization.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
While probabilistic methods are suitable for large-scale studies concerned with representativeness, nonprobability approaches may be more suitable for in-depth qualitative research in which the focus is often to understand complex social phenomena. The in-depth analysis of a small purposive sample or case study enables the discovery and identification of patterns and causal mechanisms that do not draw time and context-free assumptions. Another advantage of nonprobability sampling is its lower cost compared to probability sampling. 

Nonprobability sampling is often not appropriate in statistical quantitative research.

== Examples ==
Nonprobability sampling is widely used in qualitative research. Examples of nonprobability sampling include:
* Convenience sampling, where members of the population are chosen based on their relative ease of access. Such samples are biased because researchers may unconsciously approach some kinds of respondents and avoid others, and respondents who volunteer for a study may differ in important ways from others.
* Consecutive sampling, also known as total enumerative sampling, is a sampling technique in which every subject meeting the criteria of inclusion is selected until the required sample size is achieved. 
* Snowball sampling, involving the first respondent referring an acquaintance, and so on. Such samples are biased because they give people with more social connections an unknown but higher chance of selection, but lead to higher response rates.
* Judgment sampling or purposive sampling, where the researcher chooses the sample based on who they think would be appropriate for the study. This is used primarily when there is a limited number of people that have expertise in the area being researched, or when the interest of the research is on a specific field or a small group. Types of purposive sampling include:
** Deviant case: The researcher obtains cases that substantially differ from the dominant pattern. The case is selected in order to obtain information on unusual cases that can be specially problematic or specially good.
** Case study: The research is limited to one group, often with a similar characteristic or of small size.

* Quota sampling. This is similar to stratified random sampling, in which the researcher identifies subsets of the population of interest and then sets a target number for each category in the sample. Next, the researcher samples from the population of interest nonrandomly until the quotas are filled.

Studies intended to use probability sampling sometimes unintentionally end up using nonprobability samples because of characteristics of the sampling method. The statistical model used can also render the data a nonprobability sample.

<text>John Jean Goldkette (March 18, 1893 – March 24, 1962) was a jazz pianist and bandleader.

==Life==
Goldkette was reportedly born on March 18, 1893, in Valenciennes, France, but there is evidence that he was born in Patras, Greece. His mother, Angela Goldkette, was a circus performer from Denmark. His father is unknown.

He spent his childhood in Greece and Russia, where he studied piano at the Moscow Conservatory as a child prodigy. The family emigrated to the United States in 1911. He performed in a classical ensemble in Chicago at the age of 18, later joining one of Edgar Benson&#x27;s dance orchestras.

He leased a ballroom in Detroit and formed a band which grew to success, and was the foundation for a business empire acting as an agency for twenty orchestras and owning many dance halls. In 1936, he filed for bankruptcy; however, over the next three decades, he built up business again as a musician, conductor, and promoter. He married Lee McQuillen, a newspaperwoman, on March 4, 1939.

==Music career==
He led many jazz and dance bands, of which the most popular was his Victor Recording Orchestra of 1924–1929. The band defeated Fletcher Henderson in a battle of the bands contest. The head arranger was Bill Challis and the musicians included Bix Beiderbecke, Steve Brown, Hoagy Carmichael, Jimmy Dorsey, Tommy Dorsey, Eddie Lang, Chauncey Morehouse, Don Murray, Bill Rank, and Spiegle Willcox. Rex Stewart, a member of Henderson&#x27;s band, wrote that &quot;It was, without any question, the greatest in the world...the original predecessor to any large white dance orchestra that followed, up to Benny Goodman.&quot; Brian Rust also called it &quot;the greatest band of them all.&quot;

Goldkette was music director for the Detroit Athletic Club for over 20 years and co-owned the Graystone Ballroom in Detroit with Charles Horvath, who performed with the Goldkette Victor Band in its early years. He owned his own entertainment company, Jean Goldkette&#x27;s Orchestras and Attractions, working out of the Book-Cadillac Hotel in Detroit. He co-wrote the song &quot;It&#x27;s the Blues (No. 14 Blues)&quot; which was recorded in Detroit and released by Victor. He also wrote the words to the 1926 song &quot;New Steps&quot;.

In 1927, Paul Whiteman hired most of Goldkette&#x27;s better players due to Goldkette&#x27;s inability to meet payroll for his top-notch musicians. Goldkette helped organize McKinney&#x27;s Cotton Pickers and Glen Gray&#x27;s Orange Blossoms, which became popular as the Casa Loma Orchestra. In the 1930s, he left jazz to work as a booking agent and classical pianist. In 1939, he organized the American Symphony Orchestra which debuted at Carnegie Hall. Frankie Laine worked as Goldkette&#x27;s librarian.

==Death==
He moved to California in 1961 and the following year died in Santa Barbara, California, of a heart attack at the age of 69. He took a taxi to the hospital by himself and died that same day. He is buried in the Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

<text>Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, 7th Earl of Ulster (6 November 139118 January 1425), was an English nobleman and a potential claimant to the throne of England. A great-great-grandson of King Edward III of England, he was heir presumptive to King Richard II of England (both his paternal first cousin twice removed and maternal half grand-uncle) when the latter was deposed in favour of Henry IV. Edmund Mortimer&#x27;s claim to the throne was the basis of rebellions and plots against Henry IV and his son Henry V, and was later taken up by the House of York in the Wars of the Roses, though Mortimer himself was an important and loyal vassal of Henry V and Henry VI. Edmund was the last Earl of March of the Mortimer family.

==Early life==
Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, was born at New Forest, Westmeath, one of his family&#x27;s Irish estates, on 6 November 1391, the son of Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March, and Eleanor Holland. He had a younger brother, Roger (1393), and two sisters: Anne, who married Richard, Earl of Cambridge, younger son of the Duke of York (executed 1415), and Eleanor, who married Sir Edward de Courtenay (d. 1418), and had no issue.

Edmund Mortimer&#x27;s mother was the daughter of Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent, and Alice FitzAlan. Thomas Holland&#x27;s mother, Joan of Kent, a granddaughter of Edward I, was the mother of Richard II by her second marriage; Alice Fitzalan was the daughter of Richard FitzAlan, 3rd Earl of Arundel, and his second wife, Eleanor, daughter of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, grandson of King Henry III.

Edmund Mortimer was thus a descendant of Henry III and Edward I and a half-grandnephew of Richard II through his mother, and more importantly a descendant of King Edward III through his paternal grandmother Philippa of Clarence, only child of King Edward III&#x27;s second surviving son, Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence. Because King Richard II had no issue, Edmund&#x27;s father, Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March, was heir presumptive during his lifetime, and at his death in Ireland on 20 July 1398 his place in the succession fell to his eldest son, Edmund. Thus in terms of male primogeniture Edmund was heir-presumptive to the throne over and above the house of Lancaster, the children of Edward III&#x27;s third son John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster.

However, on 30 September 1399, when Edmund Mortimer was not yet eight years of age, his fortunes changed entirely. Richard II was deposed by Henry Bolingbroke, the new Duke of Lancaster, who became King Henry IV and had his own son, the future King Henry V, recognized as heir apparent at his first Parliament. The King put the young Edmund and his brother Roger in the custody of Sir Hugh Waterton at Windsor and Berkhamsted castles, but they were treated honourably, and for part of the time brought up with the King&#x27;s own children, John and Philippa.

==Rebellion against Henry IV==
On 22 June 1402, Edmund&#x27;s uncle, Sir Edmund Mortimer, son of the 3rd Earl, was captured by the Welsh rebel leader, Owain Glyndŵr, at the Battle of Bryn Glas. Henry IV accused Sir Edmund of deserting to Glyndŵr, refused to ransom him, and confiscated his property. Sir Edmund then married Glyndŵr&#x27;s daughter, and on 13 December 1402 proclaimed in writing that his nephew Edmund was the rightful heir to King Richard II.

Sir Edmund&#x27;s sister, Edmund&#x27;s aunt, was married to Henry &quot;Hotspur&quot; Percy, son of the Earl of Northumberland. In 1403, the Percys rose in rebellion in collusion with Glyndŵr and Sir Edmund. Hotspur was defeated and slain at Shrewsbury.

The alliance of Glyndŵr, Sir Edmund, and the Percys survived this setback. In February 1405, they agreed to a three-way division of the kingdom. This agreement was apparently connected to a plot to free Edmund and his brother Roger from King Henry&#x27;s custody and carry them into Wales. On 13 February 1405, the boys were abducted from Windsor Castle, but they were quickly recaptured near Cheltenham. Constance of York was held responsible and arrested. She implicated her brother, the Duke of York, who was imprisoned at Pevensey Castle for seventeen weeks. As a result of the failed abduction, on 1 February 1406, Edmund and Roger were put under stricter supervision at Pevensey Castle under Sir John Pelham (d.1429), where they remained until 1409. On 1 February 1409 Edmund and Roger were given in charge to the King&#x27;s son, the Prince of Wales, who was only five years older than Edmund. They remained in custody for the remainder of Henry IV&#x27;s reign.

Edmund Mortimer&#x27;s sisters, Anne and Eleanor, who were in the care of their mother until her death in 1405, were not well treated by Henry IV, and were described as &#x27;destitute&#x27; after her death.

==Reign of Henry V==
On his accession in 1413 Henry V set Edmund Mortimer at liberty, and on 8 April 1413, the day before the new King&#x27;s coronation, Edmund Mortimer and his brother Roger were made Knights of the Bath.

On 9 June 1413, the King granted Edmund Mortimer livery of his estates. Henry IV&#x27;s Queen, Joan of Navarre, had been granted authority over Edmund&#x27;s marriage on 24 February 1408, but she later ceded this to Henry while Prince of Wales. On 17 January 1415 Edmund obtained a papal dispensation to marry &#x27;a fit woman&#x27; related to him in the third degree of kindred or affinity. This allowed him to marry his second cousin once removed, Anne Stafford, the daughter of Anne of Gloucester and Edmund Stafford, 5th Earl of Stafford. Like Mortimer, she was a descendant of Edward III. The King was displeased, and imposed an enormous fine of 10,000 marks.

Despite this momentary discord, Edmund Mortimer was entirely loyal to Henry V. He never made any claim to the throne, despite being senior in descent. He was one of Henry&#x27;s most trusted counsellors.

On 16 April 1415 Mortimer was present at the council which determined on war with France, and on 24 July 1415, he was a witness to the King&#x27;s will.

While preparations for the invasion were underway, some discontented nobles launched the Southampton Plot, to take Mortimer to Wales and proclaim him king. The chief plotter was his sister Anne&#x27;s husband, the Earl of Cambridge. When Mortimer was made privy to this plan, he revealed the conspiracy to the King at Portchester on 31 July. Afterwards, he sat on the commission which condemned Cambridge and the other conspirators to death; they were beheaded on 2 and 5 August. On 7 August, the King formally pardoned Mortimer for any nominal involvement in the plot.

Mortimer was deeply in debt when he accompanied Henry V&#x27;s forces to France. He took part in several campaigns in Normandy, including the Siege of Harfleur, where he contracted dysentery, and was forced to return to England. On 15 August 1416 he was appointed a captain of the expedition sent to relieve Harfleur under John, Duke of Bedford, and Sir Walter Hungerford, and was with the army which conquered Normandy in 1417 and 1418. In July 1420 he was at the siege of Melun.

In February 1421 Mortimer accompanied the King back to England with his bride, Catherine of Valois, and bore the sceptre at Catherine&#x27;s coronation on 21 February. He returned to France with Henry V in June 1421, and was at the Siege of Meaux, where the King fell mortally ill, dying on 31 August 1422.

==Final years==

Henry V was succeeded by his nine-month-old son, King Henry VI, and on 9 December 1422 Mortimer was appointed to the Regency Council of the regency government, 1422–1437.

On 9 May 1423 he was appointed the King&#x27;s lieutenant in Ireland for nine years, but at first exercised his authority through a deputy, Edward Dantsey, Bishop of Meath, and remained in England. However, after a violent quarrel with the King&#x27;s uncle Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, and the execution of his kinsman, Sir John Mortimer, Mortimer was &quot;sent out of the way to Ireland&quot;. He arrived there in the autumn of 1424, and on 18 or 19 January 1425 died of plague at Trim Castle. He was buried at Stoke-by-Clare, Suffolk, where he had founded a college of secular canons in 1414.

Mortimer had no issue, and at his death the Mortimer line of the Earls of March became extinct. The heir to his estates and titles was the son of his sister Anne and the Earl of Cambridge, Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York (1411–1460). Richard also inherited Mortimer&#x27;s claim to the throne, which he eventually raised, causing the Wars of the Roses.

His widow, Anne, married, before 6 March 1427, John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter. She died on 20 or 24 September 1432, and was buried in the church of St Katharine&#x27;s by the Tower.

The Wigmore chronicle describes Edmund Mortimer as &quot;severe in his morals, composed in his acts, circumspect in his talk, and wise and cautious during the days of his adversity&quot;.

==Shakespeare and the Mortimers==

Events in the life of Sir Edmund Mortimer, uncle of Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, were dramatized by Shakespeare in &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;. In the play, Shakespeare accurately identifies the former as Hotspur&#x27;s brother-in-law, but simultaneously conflates him with his nephew by referring to him as &quot;Earl of March&quot;.

The Southampton Plot is dramatized in Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Henry V&quot;. However, its intent is misstated, and Mortimer&#x27;s role in exposing it and condemning the plotters is completely omitted.

Edmund Mortimer also appears in &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot;. He is incorrectly depicted as an old man who has been imprisoned in the Tower of London since the rise of Henry IV. Furthermore, in an entirely fictional scene, Mortimer explains to his nephew Richard their family&#x27;s claim to the throne, praises the efforts of Richard&#x27;s father to make Mortimer king, and urges Richard to pursue his own claim to the throne. In reality, Richard was thirteen years old when his uncle died, and at the time was being raised in the north of England as a ward of the crown by Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland.

<doc id="267633" wikidata="Q774269" url="?curid=267633" title="Buena Vista Social Club (film)">
<text>Buena Vista Social Club is a 1999 documentary film directed by Wim Wenders about the music of Cuba. It is named for a danzón that became the title piece of the album &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot;. The film is an international co-production of Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Cuba.

In 2020, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Content==
The film documents how Ry Cooder, a long-time friend of Wenders, brought together the ensemble of legendary Cuban musicians to record an album (also called &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot;) and to perform twice with a full line-up: in April 1998 in Amsterdam (two nights) and the 1st of July 1998 in the United States (at the Carnegie Hall, New York City). Although they are geographically close, travel between Cuba and the United States is restricted due to the political tension between the two countries, so many of the artists were travelling there for the first time. The film shows their reactions to this experience, as well as including footage of the resultant sell-out concert. It also includes interviews with each of the main performers.

==Musicians==
* Francisco Repilado, aka Compay Segundo (vocals and tres)
* Eliades Ochoa (vocals and guitar)
* Ry Cooder (slide guitar)
* Joachim Cooder, Ry&#x27;s son (percussion)
* Ibrahim Ferrer (vocals, congas, claves, bongos)
* Omara Portuondo (vocals)
* Rubén González (piano)
* Orlando &quot;Cachaito&quot; López (Double bass)
* Amadito Valdés
* Manuel &quot;Guajiro&quot; Mirabal (trumpet)
* Barbarito Torres (laúd)
* Pío Leyva
* Manuel &quot;Puntillita&quot; Licea (vocals)
* Juan de Marcos González (güiro)

===Critical reception===

The consensus summarizes: &quot;A hopeful gesture of cultural outreach set to an irresistible soundtrack, &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot; is an enriching and zesty experience.&quot; Metacritic reports an 81 out of 100 rating based on 19 critics.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for an Academy Award for best documentary feature in 2000. It won as best documentary in the European Film Awards as well as many others. The album &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot; features studio versions of the music heard in the film.

==Influence==
The film helped the musicians, some of them already in their nineties, become known to a worldwide audience, with some going on to release popular solo albums. These included Ibrahim Ferrer, Compay Segundo, Rubén González and Elíades Ochoa. The latter went on to support younger musicians making the same style of music beyond 2010 under the name &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot;.

<text>McKinney&#x27;s Cotton Pickers were an American jazz band, founded in Detroit, Michigan, United States in 1926, and led by Bill McKinney, who expanded his Synco Septet to ten players. Cuba Austin took over for McKinney on drums, with the latter becoming the band&#x27;s manager. Between 1927 and 1931, they were one of the most popular African American bands. Many of their records for Victor were bestsellers.

In 1927, Fletcher Henderson&#x27;s arranger and saxophone player Don Redman was invited to become the Cotton Pickers&#x27; musical director and he assembled a band. John Nesbitt helped Redman with arrangements and rehearsals. The band in 1928 included Cuba Austin (drums and vocals), Langston Curl (trumpet), Ralph Escudero (tuba), Claude Jones, Redman (clarinet, alto saxophone, baritone saxophone, vocals), Todd Rhodes (piano, celeste), Prince Robinson (clarinet, tenor saxophone), Milton Senior (trombone), George Thomas (clarinet, alto saxophone, tenor saxophone, vocals) and Dave Wilborn (banjo, vocals).

Other band members included George Bias (vocals), Benny Carter (clarinet, alto saxophone), Doc Cheatham (trumpet), Bill Coti (vocals), Ed Cuffee (trombone), Lois Deppe (vocals), Jimmy Dudley (clarinet, tenor saxophone), Robert Inge (clarinet, (alto saxophone), Quentin Jackson (trombone), Moxey-Hilton Jefferson (clarinet, alto saxophone), James P. Johnson (piano), Buddy Lee (trumpet), Donald King (vocals), Frank Marvin (vocals), Theodore McCord (clarinet, tenor saxophone), Jim Napier (vocals), Rex Stewart (cornet), and Billy Taylor (tuba). Towards the end of 1929, multiple soloists who were not regular members of the band sat in for a series of recordings. These included Leonard Davis (trumpet), Sidney de Paris (trumpet), Coleman Hawkins (clarinet, tenor saxophone), Fats Waller (piano, celeste), Joe &quot;Fox&quot; Smith (trumpet, cornet), and Kaiser Marshall (drums).

In 1931, Redman left to form a band and was replaced by Benny Carter. The Cotton Pickers disbanded in 1934, unable to make money during the Great Depression. Manager of the band was Jean Goldkette who arranged for the group to record &quot;Birmingham Bertha&quot; for him in July 1929.

A New McKinney&#x27;s Cotton Pickers was organized in the early 1970s by David Hutson, using the arrangements by Don Redman. The band recorded several albums and featured banjoist Dave Wilborn, who was the only surviving original member. The new group recorded music with Detroit trombonist Al Winters, as well as other leading members of Detroit&#x27;s jazz scene during the era of the 1970s though the 1990s.

<doc id="267637" wikidata="Q1509050" url="?curid=267637" title="Sinc filter">
<text>In signal processing, a sinc filter can refer to either a sinc-in-time filter whose impulse response is a sinc function and whose frequency response is rectangular, or to a sinc-in-frequency filter whose impulse response is rectangular and whose frequency response is a sinc function. Calling them according to which domain the filter resembles a sinc avoids confusion. If the domain is unspecified, sinc-in-time is often assumed, or context hopefully can infer the correct domain.

== Sinc-in-time ==
Sinc-in-time is an ideal filter that removes all frequency components above a given cutoff frequency, without attenuating lower frequencies, and has linear phase response. It may thus be considered a &quot;brick-wall filter&quot; or &quot;rectangular filter.&quot;

Its impulse response is a sinc function in the time domain:

formula_1

while its frequency response is a rectangular function:

:formula_2

where formula_3 (representing its bandwidth) is an arbitrary cutoff frequency.

Its impulse response is given by the inverse Fourier transform of its frequency response:

: formula_4

where &quot;sinc&quot; is the normalized sinc function.

=== Brick-wall filters ===
An idealized electronic filter with full transmission in the pass band, complete attenuation in the stop band, and abrupt transitions is known colloquially as a &quot;brick-wall filter&quot; (in reference to the shape of the transfer function). The sinc-in-time filter is a brick-wall low-pass filter, from which brick-wall band-pass filters and high-pass filters are easily constructed.

The lowpass filter with brick-wall cutoff at frequency &quot;B&quot;&quot;L&quot; has impulse response and transfer function given by:

:formula_5

:formula_6

The band-pass filter with lower band edge &quot;B&quot;&quot;L&quot; and upper band edge &quot;B&quot;&quot;H&quot; is just the difference of two such sinc-in-time filters (since the filters are zero phase, their magnitude responses subtract directly):

:formula_7

:formula_8

The high-pass filter with lower band edge &quot;B&quot;&quot;H&quot; is just a transparent filter minus a sinc-in-time filter, which makes it clear that the Dirac delta function is the limit of a narrow-in-time sinc-in-time filter:

:formula_9

:formula_10

=== Unrealizable ===
As the sinc-in-time filter has infinite impulse response in both positive and negative time directions, it is non-causal and has an infinite delay (i.e., its compact support in the frequency domain forces its time response not to have compact support meaning that it is ever-lasting) and infinite order (i.e., the response cannot be expressed as a linear differential equation with a finite sum). However, it is used in conceptual demonstrations or proofs, such as the sampling theorem and the Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula.

Sinc-in-time filters must be approximated for real-world (non-abstract) applications, typically by windowing and truncating an ideal sinc-in-time filter kernel, but doing so reduces its ideal properties. This applies to other brick-wall filters built using sinc-in-time filters.

=== Stability ===
The sinc filter is not bounded-input–bounded-output (BIBO) stable. That is, a bounded input can produce an unbounded output, because the integral of the absolute value of the sinc function is infinite. A bounded input that produces an unbounded output is sgn(sinc(&quot;t&quot;)). Another is sin(2&quot;Bt&quot;)&quot;u&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), a sine wave starting at time 0, at the cutoff frequency.

==Frequency-domain sinc==
The simplest implementation of a sinc-in-frequency filter uses a boxcar impulse response to produce a simple moving average (specifically if divide by the number of samples), also known as accumulate-and-dump filter (specifically if simply sum without a division). It can be modeled as a FIR filter with all formula_11 coefficients equal. It is sometimes cascaded to produce higher-order moving averages (see and cascaded integrator–comb filter).

This filter can be used for crude but fast and easy downsampling (a.k.a. decimation) by a factor of &quot;formula_12&quot; The simplicity of the filter is foiled by its mediocre low-pass capabilities. The stop-band contains periodic lobes with gradually decreasing height in between the nulls at multiples of formula_13. The first lobe is -11.3 dB for a 4-sample moving average, or -12.8 dB for an 8-sample moving average, and -13.1 dB for a 16-sample moving average. An formula_11-sample filter sampled at formula_15 will alias all non-fully attenuated signal components lying above formula_16 to the baseband ranging from DC to formula_17

A group averaging filter processing formula_11 samples has formula_19 transmission zeroes evenly-spaced by formula_20 with the lowest zero at formula_21 and the highest zero at formula_22 (the Nyquist frequency). Above the Nyquist frequency, the frequency response is mirrored and then is repeated periodically above formula_15 forever.

The magnitude of the frequency response (plotted in these graphs) is useful when one wants to know how much frequencies are attenuated. Though the sinc function really oscillates between negative and positive values, negative values of the frequency response simply correspond to a 180-degree phase shift.

An &quot;inverse sinc filter&quot; may be used for equalization in the digital domain (e.g. a FIR filter) or analog domain (e.g. opamp filter) to counteract undesired attenuation in the frequency band of interest to provide a flat frequency response.

See for application of the sinc kernel as the simplest windowing function.

<text>William McKinney (September 17, 1895 – October 14, 1969) was an American jazz drummer who led a series of musical groups, most notably McKinney&#x27;s Cotton Pickers.

== Early life ==
McKinney was born in Cynthiana, Kentucky. He worked as a drummer in a circus band, then after serving in the United States Army in World War I settled in Springfield, Ohio where he took over leadership of the Synco Jazz Band.

<doc id="267642" wikidata="Q654842" url="?curid=267642" title="British Army of the Rhine">
<text>British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) was the name given to British Army occupation forces in the Rhineland, West Germany, after the First and Second World Wars, and during the Cold War, becoming part of NATO&#x27;s Northern Army Group (NORTHAG) tasked with defending the North German Plain from the armies of the Warsaw Pact. The BAOR constituted the bulk of British forces in West Germany, and was a part of British Forces Germany (BFG). British Forces Germany consisted of elements of the three service branches of the British Armed Forces based in West Germany; BAOR controlled Army units stationed there.

==History==
===1919–1929===


The first British Army of the Rhine was created in March 1919 to implement the occupation of the Rhineland. It was originally composed of five corps, composed of two divisions each, plus a cavalry division:

II Corps: commanded by Sir Claud Jacob
:*Light Division (formed from 2nd Division): commanded by Major-General George Jeffreys
:*Southern Division (formed from 29th Division): commanded by Major-General William Heneker
IV Corps: commanded by Sir Alexander Godley
:*Lowland Division (formed from 9th (Scottish) Division)
:*Highland Division (formed from 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division)
VI Corps: commanded by Sir Aylmer Haldane
:*Northern Division (formed from 3rd Division)
:*London Division (formed from 41st Division)
IX Corps: commanded by Sir Walter Braithwaite and later by Ivor Maxse
:*Western Division (formed from 1st Division)
:*Midland Division (formed from 6th Division)
X Corps: commanded by Sir Thomas Morland
:*Lancashire Division (formed from 32nd Division)
:*Eastern Division (formed from 34th Division)
Cavalry Division (formed from 1st Cavalry Division)

Most of these units were progressively dissolved, so that by February 1920, there were only regular battalions:
:*1st Battalion Royal Irish Regiment
:*4th Battalion Worcestershire Regiment
:*2nd Battalion Black Watch (Royal Highlanders)
:*1st Battalion Middlesex Regiment
:*3rd Battalion Middlesex Regiment
:*1st Battalion Durham Light Infantry

In August 1920, Winston Churchill, as Secretary of State for War, told Parliament that the BAOR was made up of approximately 13,360 troops, consisting of staff, cavalry, Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, infantry, machine gun corps, tanks, and the usual ancillary services. The troops were located principally in the vicinity of Cologne at an approximate cost per month of £300,000. &quot;The Cologne Post&quot; was a newspaper published for members of the BAOR during this period.

From 1922 the BAOR was organised into two brigades:

1st Rhine Brigade
:*1st Battalion Northumberland Fusiliers 1922 to 1926
:*1st Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment 1922 to 1926
:*2nd Battalion Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders 1922 to 1926
:*1st Battalion York and Lancaster Regiment 1922 to 1924
:*2nd Battalion Royal Berkshire Regiment 1926 to 1928
:*2nd Battalion Royal Welch Fusiliers Nov 1926 to Oct 1929
:*2nd Battalion Worcestershire Regiment 1926 to 1928

2nd Rhine Brigade
:*2nd Battalion Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry 1922 to 1924
:*1st Battalion King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry 1922 to 1924
:*2nd Battalion King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps 1922 to 1925
:*1st Battalion Royal Ulster Rifles 1922 to 1926
:*1st Battalion Manchester Regiment 1923 to 1924
:*2nd Battalion King&#x27;s Shropshire Light Infantry 1924 to 1927
:*1st Battalion Oxford and Bucks Light Infantry 1925 to 1927
:*2nd Battalion Royal Fusiliers 1926 to 1929
:*2nd Battalion Leicestershire Regiment 1927 to 1929
:*2nd Battalion Dorsetshire Regiment 1928 to 1929

====Commanders-in-chief====
The commanders were:
*Field Marshal Lord Plumer 1918 to 1919
*General Sir William Robertson 1919 to 1920
*General Sir Thomas Morland 1920 to 1922
*General Sir Alexander Godley 1922 to 1924
*General Sir John Du Cane 1924 to 1927
*General Sir William Thwaites 1927 to 1929

===Cold War (1945–1991)===

The second British Army of the Rhine was formed on 25 August 1945 from the British Liberation Army. Its original function was to control the corps districts which were running the military government of the British zone of Allied-occupied Germany. After the assumption of government by civilians, it became the command formation for the troops in West Germany only, rather than being responsible for administration as well.

As the potential threat of Soviet invasion across the North German Plain into West Germany increased, BAOR became more responsible for the defence of West Germany than its occupation. It became the primary formation controlling the British contribution to NATO, after the formation of the alliance in 1949. Its primary combat formation was British I Corps. From 1952, the commander-in-chief of the BAOR was also the commander of NATO&#x27;s Northern Army Group (NORTHAG) in the event of a general war with the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies. The BAOR&#x27;s 50 Missile Regiment Royal Artillery was formerly armed with tactical nuclear weapons, including the MGM-52 Lance surface-to-surface tactical nuclear missile. In 1967, the force was reduced in strength to 53,000 soldiers, compared with 80,000, ten years earlier.

===Post 1994===
With the end of the Cold War, the 1993 Options for Change defence cuts resulted in BAOR being reduced in size, and in 1994 it became British Forces Germany (BFG). This force, roughly 25,000 strong, was divided between Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps, 1st Armoured Division, other combat support and combat service support forces, and administrative elements headed by United Kingdom Support Command (Germany). Garrisons which closed at this time included Soest (home of the 6th Armoured Brigade), Soltau (home of the 7th Armoured Brigade), and Minden (home of the 11th Armoured Brigade).

Following the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review, the permanent deployment of British Army units in Germany was reduced. The last military base was handed to the German Bundeswehr in February 2020.

====Commanders-in-chief====
The commanders were:
*Field Marshal Viscount Montgomery 1945 to 1946
*Lieutenant General Sir Richard McCreery 1946 to 1948
*Lieutenant General Sir Brian Horrocks 1948
*Lieutenant General Sir Charles Keightley 1948 to 1951
*General Sir John Harding 1951 to 1952
*General Sir Richard Gale 1952 to 1957
*General Sir Dudley Ward 1957 to 1960
*General Sir James Cassels 1960 to 1963
*General Sir William Stirling 1963 to 1966
*General Sir John Hackett 1966 to 1968
*General Sir Desmond Fitzpatrick 1968 to 1970
*General Sir Peter Hunt 1970 to 1973
*General Sir Harry Tuzo 1973 to 1976
*General Sir Frank King 1976 to 1978
*General Sir William Scotter 1978 to 1980
*General Sir Michael Gow 1980 to 1983
*General Sir Nigel Bagnall 1983 to 1985
*General Sir Martin Farndale 1985 to 1987

<text>The Georgian Military Road or Georgian Military Highway also known as Ghalghaï Military Road, is the historic name for a major route through the Caucasus from Georgia to Russia. Alternative routes across the mountains include the Ossetian Military Road and the Transcaucasian Highway.


==Route==
The Georgian Military Road runs for between Tbilisi (Georgia) and Vladikavkaz (Russia) and follows the traditional route used by invaders and traders throughout the ages. From Vladikavkaz, the road stretches southwards up the valley of the Terek before passing through the Darial Gorge (which marks the border between Russia and Georgia). It then passes Mount Kazbek and Gergeti Trinity Church before heading south-west through the Georgian region of Khevi to the Jvari Pass, where it reaches its maximum altitude of (). Not long after the pass the road passes the Russia–Georgia Friendship Monument, a large concrete monument built in 1983 to commemorate relations between the two countries and the bicentennial of the Treaty of Georgievsk. The road then turns south-eastwards, following the Tetri Aragvi River through Mtiuleti down to the town of Pasanauri, before heading due south. It then passes below the walls of the medieval fortress of Ananuri before cutting across the wide floodplain of the Tetri Aragvi down to a point just north of Georgia&#x27;s historic capital, Mtskheta, where it merges into Georgia&#x27;s main East-West highway (the E60). In this guise, the Georgian Military Road technically continues along the right bank of the Kura (Mtkvari) River before reaching nearby Tbilisi.

The 1914 edition of &quot;Baedeker&#x27;s Russia&quot; describes the Georgian Military Road as &#x27;one of the most beautiful mountain roads in the world&#x27;, and mentions the fact that, as early as its date of publication, &#x27;motor omnibuses of the &quot;Société française des transports automobiles du Caucase&quot; ply regularly from April 15 to Oct. 15th, [accomplishing] the journey in 10 hrs.&#x27;

==History==
People have used this route since antiquity—both Strabo (in his &quot;Geographica&quot;) and Pliny the Elder mention it. Russian troops first travelled it in 1769. Pavel Potemkin sent 800 troops to improve the road so that by October 1783 he was able to drive to Tiflis in a carriage drawn by eight horses. The Georgian Military Road in its present form was begun by the Russian military in 1799, after the Georgians had abjured centuries of Persian suzerainty and became a Russian protectorate under the 1783 Treaty of Georgievsk. Russian control of the Georgian Military Highway in the center of the Caucasus divided the Caucasian War (1817–1864) into the Russo-Circassian War (1763–1864) in the west and the Murid War in the east.

After the Russian Empire officially annexed the Kingdom of Georgia in 1801, Tsar Alexander I ordered General Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov, the commander-in-chief of Russian forces in the Caucasus, to improve the road surface to facilitate troop movement and communications. When Yermolov announced the completion of work in 1817, the highway was heralded as the &quot;Russian Simplon&quot;. However, work continued until 1863. By this stage, it had cost £4 million (equivalent to £ million in ) but according to Lord Bryce in 1876 the work was of a high quality, with two or three lanes and &quot;iron bridges over the torrents&quot;, something he considered astonishing given that within Russia proper at this time decent roads were virtually non-existent.

The Georgian Military Road played an important role in the economic development of Transcaucasia and in the Russo-Circassian War.

==The Georgian Military Road today==
The importance of the Georgian Military Road as a through route has diminished in recent years, primarily due to delays at the border crossing between Russia and Georgia, natural disasters such as landslides, and the outright closure of the border crossing by Russia in 2006.

However, since 2013, when Russia finally agreed to re-open its side of the border as a result of Armenian demands, the road has once again become an important transport artery, mainly for trailer trucks linking Armenia and Russia.

Various restrictions, however, remained (and still remain) in place, particularly for Georgian citizens, but by 2013 a representative of the Russian side of the border could tell the Interfax news agency that around three million people had passed through the Kazbegi-Verkhni Lars customs checkpoint.

The Georgian end of the Road has been subject to truck traffic jams, apparently due to the length of time needed for vehicles transiting Georgia to be admitted into Russia.
However, since the opening of a new Georgian customs, administration and parking facility at Kazbegi, the situation has improved.

<text>The Isle of Sheppey is an island off the northern coast of Kent, England, neighbouring the Thames Estuary, centred from central London. It has an area of . The island forms part of the local government district of Swale. &quot;Sheppey&quot; is derived from Old English &quot;Sceapig&quot;, meaning &quot;Sheep Island&quot;.

Today&#x27;s island was historically known as the &quot;Isles of Sheppey&quot; which were Sheppey itself, the Isle of Harty to the south east and the Isle of Elmley to the south west. Over time the channels between the islands have silted up to make one contiguous island, which is now linked by two bridges to the Kentish mainland. Sheppey, like much of north Kent, is largely formed from London Clay and is a plentiful source of fossils. The Mount near Minster rises to above sea level and is the highest point on the island. The rest of Sheppey is low-lying and the southern part of the island is marshy land criss-crossed by inlets and drains, largely used for grazing. The economy is driven by a dockyard and port, the presence of three prisons, and various caravan sites.

==The Swale==

Sheppey is separated from the mainland by a channel called the Swale. In concert with the Wantsum Channel that once separated the Isle of Thanet from mainland Britain to the east (before it silted over in the late Middle Ages), and Yantlet Creek at the Isle of Grain to the west, it was occasionally used in ancient times by ships navigating to and from ports such as Chatham and London to reduce exposure to bad weather in the Thames Estuary or North Sea.

===Bridges===
The Kingsferry Bridge was first built in 1860, thus eliminating the need for ferries. Over time, there have been four bridges built over the Swale at this point. All bridges had to allow sufficient clearance for shipping heading to the commercial docks at Ridham.

On 19 July 1860 the first bridge came into use. It was built for the London, Chatham and Dover Railway, to an Admiralty design. It had a central span raised between two towers. Trains and road traffic were able to use it, as with the next two bridges.

On 6 November 1906 the second bridge, built for the South Eastern and Chatham Railway, replaced the first. It had a &quot;rolling lift&quot; design that was originally worked by hand, but later by electricity.

In October 1959 Kingsferry Bridge, a lifting bridge, was completed, able to lift both the road and the railway line to allow ships to pass beneath.

In May 2006 the Sheppey Crossing was completed and opened on 3 July. This four-lane road bridge rises to a height of 95 feet (29m) at mean high water springs above the Swale, and carries the A249 trunk road. Pedestrian, animal and bicycle traffic, as well as the railway, are still obliged to use the lifting bridge, which still provides the most direct link between the island and the Iwade/Lower Halstow area.

On 5 September 2013, fog caused a 130 vehicle pile-up on the Sheppey Crossing bridge and its northern approach in which eight people were seriously hurt and another 30 hospitalised.

===Ferries===
Four ferries previously connected the island to mainland Kent: the King&#x27;s Ferry to Iwade, the Harty Ferry to Faversham, one from Elmley, and a passenger ferry connecting to the Port Victoria railway terminus on the Grain Peninsula. The most recently active of these, the Harty Ferry, ceased operation at the start of the First World War, although there was a short lived attempt to start a small hovercraft service between the Harty Ferry Inn and Oare Creek near Faversham in 1970.

==Sheppey history==
The complex of causewayed enclosures at Kingsborough Manor attests to the importance of the island&#x27;s high ground during the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. Later prehistoric, Roman and medieval occupation has been found by archaeologists in advance of development at Neat&#x27;s Court and St Clements CofE Primary School in Leysdown.

=== Vikings ===
In the year 835, Viking invaders attacked Sheppey. It is the first known account of a major Viking raid in Southern England. Sheppey would go on to suffer from subsequent raids, its vulnerable coastal monasteries providing a convenient target for the Danes.

In 855, Sheppey as part of the kingdom of Wessex, became the winter camp of an occupying Viking force, presumably the raiders from prior attacks. Raiding continued in the springtime, with Sheppey&#x27;s minsters being used by the invaders as feasting halls or general headquarters.

In 1016, Cnut the Great of Denmark and his forces are reported to have retreated to the Island of Sheppey rather than face King Edmund Ironside in battle during the winter. King Edmund gathered his forces during Lent and mounted an attack on Cnut shortly after Easter.

=== Shurland Hall ===

Shurland Hall, near Eastchurch, is named after its first owners, the De Shurland family. In 1188 Adam de Shurland possessed a mill with more than of mixed land, mostly marsh with a small meadow: he also let a number of cottages thereabouts.

Sir Robert de Shurland (d. 1324), a member of the family, served in the Anglo-Scottish wars, including the siege of Caerlaverock (1300), where he was knighted; and shortly afterwards obtained a charter of free warren for his manor of Ufton, in the parish of Tunstall. He fought on the rebel baronial side at the Battle of Boroughbridge (1322), was captured, and was held for over a year in the Tower of London. On his release, he was appointed mayor of Bordeaux (1323–1324).

A curious legend (first recorded in the 17th century) surrounds Sir Robert. It is said that he killed a priest, and resolved to ask the king for a pardon. Mounted on horseback, he swam out to the Nore (north of Sheppey), where the king&#x27;s ship was anchored, and gained forgiveness. On his return, he met an old woman who predicted that the horse that had helped save his life would be the cause of his death. To defy the prophecy, Sir Robert killed his horse; but later encountering its bones, he kicked them in scorn, only for a shard to pierce his foot, causing an infection from which he died. The tale takes elements from Italian, Slavic and Icelandic folklore (including the story of Oleg the Wise, and that of Örvar-Oddr). It was greatly popularised in a version published in 1837 by Richard Barham (&quot;Thomas Ingoldsby&quot;), as one of his &quot;Ingoldsby Legends&quot;.

Sir Robert died in 1324 leaving as his heir a daughter Margaret, who married William, son of Alexander Cheyne of Patrixbourne. To William passed the manor of Shurland. It remained in possession of the Cheyne family until the sixteenth century when it was sold by Sir Henry Cheyne. During the First World War troops were billeted at the Great Hall, and it suffered considerable damage as a result.

Shurland Hall is a Grade II listed building. In 2006 a grant of £300,000 was made by English Heritage to restore the hall&#x27;s façade. The Spitalfields Historic Buildings Trust carried out the restoration work which was completed in 2011. The house was put on the open market for £1.5 million, and was sold.

=== Dutch occupation of 1667 ===
Sheppey is one of few parts of what is now the United Kingdom to have been (temporarily) lost to a foreign power since William the Conqueror&#x27;s invasion in 1066. This was in June 1667, when a Dutch fleet sailing up the Thames Estuary for the Medway captured the fort at Sheerness. The fort at the time was incomplete and the garrison underfed and unpaid, so resistance to the heavily armed Dutch Navy (which, according to Samuel Pepys&#x27;s diary, was also to a large extent composed of deserters from the English Royal Navy) was hardly enthusiastic. Pepys, then secretary of the Navy Board, described Sheerness as lost &quot;after two or three hours&#x27; dispute&quot;. The Dutch quickly overran and occupied the whole island for several days before withdrawing. Prior to leaving, the Dutch took supplies, ammunition and guns, then burned everything that was combustible.

=== Capture of James II &amp; VII ===
Three miles (5 km) across the Swale lies Whitstable. The Swale channel was the point of departure selected by James II, when departing in some haste &quot;from the Protestant deliverance of the nation&quot; by William of Orange in December 1688.

A hoy having been chartered, the fugitive king landed at Elmley, only to be mobbed by local fishermen. They thought such a noble on such a humble vessel was the locally hated Jesuit Edward Petre and so took his money, watch and coronation ring. At length he was recognised by one of the assailants and the group took him in custody to Faversham, where he was detained.

=== Bluetown Heritage Centre ===
Bluetown hosts the history and Heritage Centre for the Isle of Sheppey. The Heritage Centre contains memorabilia and artefacts pertinent to the Sheppey&#x27;s history, including displays on aviation, maritime, wartime activities, and island history and offers guided walks of Sheppey Isle and Bluetown.

The present Heritage Centre is on the site of two earlier establishments. Originally called the &quot;New Inn&quot;, in 1868 the site became &quot;The Royal Oxford Music Hall&quot;. The following year the building, which is situated a few doors down from the Bluetown court house, became the Criterion Public House, with a music hall called the &quot;palace of varieties&quot; situated immediately to its rear. In 1879 the building was replaced with a brick structure.

On 5 June 1917 the Criterion was badly damaged by a German air raid. Shrapnel marks from the attack can still be seen in the dockyard wall opposite the building. After the air raid, the building was re-built in its present form retaining some of its original features. After a variety of other uses, the site became the Heritage Centre in January 2009. A special exhibition in 2014 commemorated the centenary of the First World War.

== Maritime history ==

Henry VIII, requiring the River Medway as an anchorage for his navy, ordered that the mouth of the river should be protected by a small fort. Garrison Fort was built in 1545.

Sheerness is a commercial port and main town of the Isle of Sheppey and owes much to its origins, as a Royal Naval dockyard town. Samuel Pepys established the Royal Navy Dockyard in the 17th century. Sheerness was the focus of an attack by the Dutch Navy in June 1667, when 72 hostile ships compelled the little &quot;sandspit fort&quot; there to surrender and landed a force which for a short while occupied the town. Samuel Pepys at Gravesend remarked in his diary &quot;we do plainly at this time hear the guns play&quot; and in fear departed to Brampton in Huntingdonshire.

The dockyard served the Royal Navy until 1960 and has since developed into one of the largest and fastest expanding ports in the UK. The Port of Sheerness contains at least one Grade II listed building, the Old Boat House. Built in 1866, it is the first multi-storey iron framed industrial building recorded in the UK. Decorated with ornate ironwork, it features operating rails extending the length of the building, for the movement of stores, much like a modern crane.

A large ferry terminal was built by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway at Queenborough Pier in 1876 and operated a nightly service to Flushing (Vlissingen) in the Netherlands, as well as a German mail service. These services ceased during the First World War; the terminal was used for military traffic. The small port was closed and dismantled in the 1930s. A passenger, car and lorry service was operated by Olau Line from 1974 to 1994.

The dockyard and port at Sheerness today are a significant feature of the Isle of Sheppey&#x27;s economy, which includes the extensive export/import of motor vehicles, and a large steel works, with extensive railway fixtures. The island is, however, suffering from an economic recession and these industries are not as extensive as they once were.

The area immediately outside the dockyard was occupied by dockyard workers, who built wooden houses and decorated them with Admiralty blue paint illegally acquired from the dockyard. This area was, and still is, known as Blue Town, though it is now mostly occupied by the Sheerness Steel complex.

Beyond Blue Town, an outlying residential area overlooking the sea was chiefly designed for various government officials. This area became known as Mile Town because it is one mile (1.6 km) from Sheerness.

About 200 shipwrecks are recorded around the coast of Sheppey, the most famous being the &quot;SS Richard Montgomery&quot;, a liberty ship loaded with bombs and explosives that grounded on sandbanks during the Second World War. plans were discussed with a view to removing the threat from the &quot;Montgomery&quot;. These include encasing the ship in concrete or removing the bombs; no firm decision has been made. New research commissioned by the Government in 2005–06 suggested that the threat has passed and that constant surveillance should ensure the safety of the immediate community.

== Natural history ==

In 1629 the first recorded botanical visit was paid to the island by the apothecary Thomas Johnson and colleagues. They were thought to be foreigners so were arrested and imprisoned in Queenborough Castle before being released by the Mayor.

Edward Jacob (1710–1788) purchased the little Manor of Nutts, Isle of Sheppey, in 1752. There, he pursued his hobby as a naturalist. He discovered much of interest to the antiquarian, naturalist, geologist and zoologist, although there was little prior knowledge. In 1777, Jacob published a book about his various fossil finds, including what he called &quot;the remains of an elephant&quot;.

The island has an established scorpion population. &quot;Euscorpius flavicaudis&quot; has been resident since the 1860s, believed to have been imported on a ship. They have been found to be highly adaptable and hence have survived the relative cold by conserving energy and only acting for nutrition and reproduction.

The last known colony in England of the British endemic subspecies of the Essex Emerald moth, at Windmill creek, died out as late as 1991.

In 2008 palaeontologists published details of the fossil skull, found on the island, of a large flying bird from the Eocene epoch called Dasornis in the deposits of the London Clay.

== Local government ==
From 1894 to 1968, Sheppey comprised the Municipal Borough of Queenborough, Sheerness Urban District and Sheppey Rural District (consisting of the civil parishes of Eastchurch, Elmley, Harty, Leysdown-on-Sea, Minster in Sheppey and Warden). In 1968, all these units were abolished and simultaneously a new single Municipal Borough of Queenborough-in-Sheppey was created, covering the entire island. In 1974, this local government unit was abolished and Sheppey then came within the newly created Swale district.

In parliamentary terms, Sheppey has been in the constituency of Sittingbourne and Sheppey since 1997, a Conservative-Labour marginal seat; prior to this it was in the Faversham constituency, also a marginal but held by the Conservatives for the last 27 years of its existence.

== Early aviation ==

The island has a long history of aviation development in England. It was home to Lord Brabazon&#x27;s Royal Aero Club which formed in Leysdown in the early 1900s to popularise ballooning. The club took to the aeroplane with relish, and in July 1909 the Short Brothers established Shellbeach Aerodrome on nearby marshland to accommodate six Wright Flyers, moving a few kilometres the next year to Eastchurch where a new more appropriate aerodrome had been built for the club.

The Eastchurch airfield played a significant role in the history of British aviation from 1909 when Frank McClean acquired Stonepits Farm, on the marshes across from Leysdown, converting the land into an airfield for members of the Aero Club of Great Britain.

The Short brothers, Horace, Eustace and Oswald, built aircraft at Battersea to be tested at the site; later Moore-Brabazon, Professor Huntington, Charles S. Rolls and Cecil Grace all visited and used the flying club&#x27;s services. Wilbur Wright and his brother Orville came to the Isle of Sheppey to visit the new flying grounds of the Aero Club. In 1909, Moore-Brabazon made the first live cargo flight by fixed-wing aircraft, by tying a waste-paper basket to a wing strut of his Shorts-built Wright aircraft. Then, using it as a &quot;cargo hold&quot;, he airlifted one small pig.

The Eastchurch airfield was also the site, in July 1911, of the competition for the Gordon Bennett Cup for powered air racing, attended by flyers from all over the world, and won that year by the American pilot C. T. Weymann.

A stained glass window in the south side of All Saints&#x27; Church, Eastchurch (built in 1432), was dedicated to Rolls and Grace, who were killed in July and December 1910 respectively.

In July 2009, Eastchurch celebrated 100 years of aviation history associated with the island. SkySheppey brought together a number of associations and joined with many visitors to recognise the importance of British aviation history that started at Eastchurch.

From March 2015 a new museum, The Aviation Museum Eastchurch, was set up at The Old Mill Green off Brabazon Way, HMP Standford Hill, to commemorate the pioneer aviators and the site as a long established RAF Station serving from WW1 through to the end of WW2.

==Sheppey today==

The largest town on the island is Minster with a population of 21,319. Other towns include Sheerness and Leysdown-on-Sea. The whole north coast is dotted with caravan parks and holiday homes; there is also a naturist beach beyond Leysdown, towards Shellness. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds managed a portion of Elmley National Nature Reserve known as Elmley Marshes up until 2013, at which point it reverted to management by Elmley Conservation Trust, owners of the site.
There are three prisons on the island, all located to the south of the village of Eastchurch: HMP Elmley, HMP Standford Hill and HMP Swaleside. The total inmate population is in the region of 2,800.

In the 2011 census, the island had a resident population of 40,300, many of whom commute to the mainland via the Sheerness-Sittingbourne rail link and the new Sheppey Crossing Bridge.

==Education==
Secondary education on the island is provided by Oasis Academy Isle of Sheppey. The school moved into new buildings in February 2013 and is split between two sites: East and West. The academy is split horizontally into five mini-schools.

Further education is provided by EKC Sheppey College.

There are several primary schools on the island.

==Sport and leisure==

The island has a non-league football club, Sheppey United F.C., based at Holm Park and who play in the . In 2024, K Sports F.C. rebranded to Sheppey Sports FC following a relocation from Aylesford to Holm Park.

The island&#x27;s largest cricket club is Minster Cricket Club, who compete in the Kent Cricket League. Sheppey Cricket Club plays in the Kent Regional Cricket League.

The island also has a rugby union club, Sheppey RFC.

The Isle of Sheppey Sailing club (previously Sheppey Yacht Club) organises the Round the Isle of Sheppey Race, established in 1959, and other races for mono hulls and catamarans.

==Local media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South East and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Bluebell Hill TV transmitter.

The island is served by county-wide radio stations: BBC Radio Kent on 96.7 FM, Heart South on 102.8 FM and Gold on 603 AM.

Three radio stations broadcast from Sheppey: BRFM 95.6 FM broadcasts 24 hours a day from studios on the Minster Cliffs; Sheppey FM 92.2 is a community radio station based in the Heritage Pavilion, Sheerness; and Hospital Radio Swale which broadcasts from the Sheppey Community Hospital in Minster.

The &quot;Sheerness Times Guardian&quot; is the island&#x27;s local weekly newspaper.

==Airport==
Various concepts for a Thames Estuary Airport have been proposed since the 1940s, with two such concepts were based on creating an offshore artificial island north east of the Isle of Sheppey. The most recent was a 2008 concept supported by the then Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, who felt that the artificial island off Sheppey would be a viable alternative to creating a new third runway at Heathrow.

<text>I Corps (&quot;First Corps&quot;) was an army corps in existence as an active formation in the British Army for most of the 80 years from its creation in the First World War until the end of the Cold War, longer than any other corps. It had a short-lived precursor during the Waterloo Campaign. It served as the operational component of the British Army of the Rhine (part of NATO&#x27;s Northern Army Group (NORTHAG)) during the Cold War, and was tasked with defending West Germany.

==Napoleonic precursor==

Assembling an army in Belgium to fight Napoleon&#x27;s resurgent forces in the spring of 1815, the Duke of Wellington formed it into army corps, deliberately mixing units from the Anglo-Hanoverian, Dutch-Belgian and German contingents so that the weaker elements would be stiffened by more experienced or reliable troops. As he put it: &#x27;It was necessary to organize these troops in brigades, divisions, and corps d’armee with those better disciplined and more accustomed to war&#x27;. He placed I Corps under the command of the Prince of Orange and it was this corps that was first contacted by the advancing French at Quatre Bras on 16 June 1815. However, Wellington did not employ the corps as tactical entities, and continued his accustomed practice of issuing orders directly to divisional and lower commanders. When he drew up his army on the ridge at Waterloo, elements of the various corps were mixed up, and although he gave the Prince of Orange nominal command of the centre, that officer had different forces under him. Subsequent to the battle, the corps structure was re-established for the advance into France, I Corps being commanded by Maj-Gen Sir John Byng, the Prince of Orange having been wounded at Waterloo.

===Composition of I Corps in the Waterloo Campaign===
General Officer Commanding (GOC): General The Prince of Orange
* 1st (British) Division (British Guards)
* 3rd (British) Division (Anglo-Hanoverian)
* 2nd (Netherlands) Division (Dutch-Belgian)
* 3rd (Netherlands) Division (Dutch-Belgian)

==Prior to the First World War==

After Waterloo the army corps structure largely disappeared from the British Army, except for ad hoc formations assembled during annual manoeuvres (e.g. Army Manoeuvres of 1913). In 1876 a Mobilisation Scheme for eight army corps was published, with &#x27;First Corps&#x27; based on Colchester. In 1880 First Corps&#x27; organization was:
* 1st Division (Colchester)
** 1st Brigade (Colchester)
*** 1st Bn. 2nd Foot (Colchester), 1st Bn. 10th Foot (Colchester)
** 2nd Brigade (Colchester)
*** 1st Bn. 9th Foot (Kinsale), 28th Foot (Fermoy)
** Divisional Troops
*** 2nd Bn. 12th Foot (Portsmouth), Buckinghamshire Yeomanry (Buckingham), 1st Company Royal Engineers (Shorncliffe)
** Artillery
*** F/1st Brigade Royal Artillery (Ipswich), D/1st Brigade RA (Woolwich)
* 2nd Division (Chelmsford)
** 1st Brigade (Chelmsford)
*** 1st Bn. 15th Foot (Tipperary), 47th Foot (The Curragh)
** 2nd Brigade (Warley)
*** 1st Bn. 3rd Foot (Shorncliffe), 49th Foot (Dover), 55th Foot (Shorncliffe)
** Divisional Troops
*** 1st Bn. 23rd Foot (Woolwich), Hertfordshire Yeomanry (St Albans), 20th Company Royal Engineers (Chatham)
** Artillery
*** I/4th Brigade RA (Newcastle), N/4th Brigade RA (Woolwich), M/4th Brigade RA (Newcastle)
* 3rd Division (Gravesend)
** 1st Brigade (Gravesend)
*** 77th Foot (Dublin), 104th Foot (Belfast), 105th Foot (Newry)
** 2nd Brigade (Chatham)
*** 2nd Bn. 5th Foot (Chatham), 31st Foot (Chatham), 86th Foot (Chatham)
** Divisional Troops
*** 87th Foot (Limerick), West Kent Yeomanry (Maidstone), 22nd Company Royal Engineers (Woolwich)
** Artillery
*** O/4th Brigade RA (Weedon), A/5th Brigade RA (Weedon)
* Cavalry Brigade (Maldon)
** 3rd Hussars (Colchester), 4th Hussars (Shorncliffe), Suffolk Yeomanry (Bury St Edmunds), F Battery C Brigade Royal Horse Artillery (Canterbury)
* Corps Artillery (Colchester)
** E Battery C Brigade RHA (Woolwich), H Battery A Brigade RHA (Woolwich)
** G/1st Brigade RA (Woolwich), B/5th Brigade RA (Sheffield)
* Corps Engineers (Colchester)
** A (Pontoons) Troop Royal Engineer Train (Aldershot)
** C (Telegraph) Troop Royal Engineer Train (Aldershot)
** 23rd Company Royal Engineers and Field Park (Chatham)

This scheme had been dropped by 1881. The Stanhope Memorandum of 1891 (drawn up by Edward Stanhope when Secretary of State for War) laid down the policy that after providing for garrisons and India, the army should be able to mobilise three army corps for home defence, two of regular troops and one partly of militia, each of three divisions. Only after those commitments, it was hoped, might two army corps be organised for the unlikely eventuality of deployment abroad.

When the Second Anglo-Boer War was imminent in September 1899, a field army, referred to as the Army Corps (sometimes I Army Corps) was mobilised and sent to Cape Town. It was, in fact, &#x27;about the equivalent of the First Army Corps of the existing mobilization scheme&#x27;, and was placed under the command of Gen Sir Redvers Buller, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Aldershot Command. However, once in South Africa the corps never operated as such, and the three divisions (1st, 2nd and 3rd) were widely dispersed.

The 1901 Army Estimates introduced by St John Brodrick allowed for six army corps based on the six regional commands (Aldershot, Southern, Irish, Eastern, Northern and Scottish) of which only I Corps (Aldershot Command) and II Corps (Southern Command on Salisbury Plain) would be entirely formed of regular troops. However, these arrangements remained theoretical, the title &#x27;I Corps&#x27; being added to Aldershot Command. In early October 1902 a memorandum was issued showing the organization and allocation of the 1st Army Corps, to which Sir John French had recently been appointed in command:
* 1st Division
** 1st Brigade (Guards) (Marlborough Lines)
** 2nd Infantry Brigade (HQ Blackdown)
** One squadron of cavalry, two brigade divisions Royal Field Artillery, an ammunition column, a field company Royal Engineers, one company Army Service Corps, a field hospital
* 2nd Division
** 3rd Infantry Brigade (HQ Stanhope Lines)
** 4th Infantry Brigade (HQ Wellington)
** One squadron of cavalry, two brigade divisions Royal Field Artillery, an ammunition column, a field company Royal Engineers, one company Army Service Corps, a field hospital
* 3rd Division
** 5th Infantry Brigade (HQ Bordon)
** 6th Infantry Brigade (HQ Bordon)
** One squadron of cavalry, two brigade divisions Royal Field Artillery, an ammunition column, a field company Royal Engineers, one company Army Service Corps, a field hospital
* 1st Cavalry Brigade (South Cavalry Barracks)

In 1907 the title changed to &#x27;Aldershot Corps&#x27; but reverted to simply &#x27;Aldershot Command&#x27; the following year. Finally, the Haldane Reforms of 1907 established a six-division British Expeditionary Force for deployment overseas, but only Aldershot Command possessed two infantry divisions and a full complement of &#x27;army troops&#x27; to form an army corps in the field.

==First World War==
Pre-war planning for the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) did not envisage any intermediate headquarters between GHQ and the six infantry divisions, but it was assumed that if corps HQs became necessary, then the GOC Aldershot Command would automatically become GOC I Corps in the field. On mobilisation in August 1914 the decision was made to conform to the two-division army corps organisation employed by the French armies alongside which the BEF was to operate. Sir Douglas Haig, then commanding at Aldershot, therefore took I Corps HQ to France with 1st Division and 2nd Division under command, and it remained on the Western Front throughout the war. It had a peripheral part at the Battle of Mons, then saw hard fighting at the Battle of the Aisne and First Battle of Ypres in 1914, at the Battle of Aubers Ridge in the Spring of 1915 and alongside the Canadian Corps at the Battle of Hill 70, as well in many other large battles of the First World War.

===Composition of I Corps in First World War===

The composition of army corps changed frequently. Some representative orders of battle for I Corps are given here.

Order of Battle at Mons 23 August 1914

General Officer Commanding: Lieut-Gen Sir Douglas Haig
* Brigadier-General, General Staff (BGGS): J.E. Gough VC
* Brigadier-General, Royal Artillery: H.S. Horne
* Colonel, Royal Engineers: Brig-Gen Spring R. Rice
* 1st Division
* 2nd Division
* Army Troops attached (20 August 1914)
** 1st Army HQ Signal Company, Royal Engineers
*** D (Air Line) Section
*** G, K &amp; L (Cable) Sections
** No 2 Section, 1st Printing Company, Royal Engineers
** No 1 Bridging Train, Royal Engineers
** B Squadron, North Irish Horse
** Company, 1st Bn Cameron Highlanders
** B &amp; C Sections, No 19 Field Ambulance, RAMC

By the time of the battles of Aubers Ridge and Festubert (May 1915), I Corps still had 1st and 2nd Divisions under command, but had been reinforced by 47th (1/2nd London) Division of the Territorial Force, and 1st Canadian Division. Once the era of trench warfare had set in on the Western Front (1915–17), the BEF left its army corps in position for long periods, so that they became familiar with their sector, while rotating divisions as they required rest, training, or transfer to other sectors.

From May 1916 to August 1917, I Corps Cavalry Regiment was provided by the 1st South Irish Horse.

On 25 September 1918, for the final battles, I Corps was transferred from First Army to Sir William Birdwood&#x27;s Fifth Army.

==Second World War==

===Battle of France===
During the Second World War, I Corps&#x27; first assignment was again to the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) where it was commanded by General Sir John Dill, and then Lieutenant General Michael Barker from April 1940. After the Germans broke through Allied lines in the Battle of France in May 1940, the BEF was forced to retreat to Dunkirk for evacuation to England. The Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the BEF, General Lord Gort, ordered Barker to form the rearguard with I Corps to cover the evacuation, and surrender to the Germans as a last resort. However, the acting commander of II Corps, Major General Bernard Montgomery, advised Gort that Barker was in an unfit state to be left in final command, and recommended that Major General Harold Alexander of the 1st Division should be put in charge. Gort did as Montgomery advised, and in the event the bulk of I Corps was successfully evacuated. As Montgomery recalled: &#x27;&quot;Alex&quot; got everyone away in his own calm and confident manner&#x27;.

===North-West Europe===
After returning to Britain, I Corps remained there, based at Hickleton Hall in South Yorkshire within Northern Command, on anti-invasion duties, preparing defences to repel a German invasion of the United Kingdom.

I Corps, now commanded by Lieutenant General John Crocker, then took part in the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944 where, along with XXX Corps, under Lieutenant General Gerard Bucknall (who had commanded I Corps between April and August 1943), it was a spearhead corps of Lieutenant General Miles Dempsey&#x27;s British Second Army, itself part of the 21st Army Group. The corps was then involved in the Battle of Normandy in fierce attritional fighting for control of the Normandy beachhead.

After fighting for two months in the Battle for Caen, I Corps was subordinated on 1 August 1944 to the Canadian First Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Harry Crerar, for the remainder of the Normandy campaign and the subsequent operations in the Low Countries. I Corps participated in Operation Astonia (the capture of Le Havre) and Clearing the Channel Coast.

I Corps later helped to garrison &quot;The Island&quot; area between Arnhem and Nijmegen in the aftermath of Operation Market Garden.

During Operation Pheasant in North Brabant, I Corps was unique in fielding divisions from several nations: Polish 1st Armoured Division, Canadian 4th Armoured Division, British 49th &quot;Polar Bears&quot; Division, and US 104th &quot;Timberwolf&quot; Division.

After the Battle of the Scheldt, I Corps gave up command of any combat forces. Its headquarters administered 21st Army Group&#x27;s logistics area around the port of Antwerp, Belgium until the end of the war.

* 7th Armoured Division

==British Army of the Rhine==
After the defeat of Germany, the 21st Army Group became the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), and 1 Corps, under the command of Lieutenant-General Ivor Thomas, was transformed into a corps district, with an administrative, rather than combat, role. It was disbanded in 1947.

In October 1951 the corps was reactivated to become the principal combat element of the BAOR, with its headquarters in Bielefeld. In March 1952, following the reactivation of 6th Armoured Division, its component formations were:
* 2nd Infantry Division
* 6th Armoured Division
* 7th Armoured Division
* 11th Armoured Division

Included as part of this was Canadian Forces Europe, as Canada&#x27;s contribution to the NATO land forces in Germany. A Canadian mechanised brigade remained part of BAOR until 1970, until it was moved south. The size of this force, 6,700, was such that it was referred to within British circles as a &quot;light division&quot;.

4th Division was reformed from 11th Armoured Division on 1 April 1956.

On 1 July 1960, the 5th Division was redesignated as the 1st Division and the renamed formation took on the 1st Division&#x27;s lineage and insignia. The division was located at Verden an der Aller, Germany, and formed part of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). The formation conducted division-wide trials using the &quot;square brigade&quot; concept. When they were deemed successful in 1970, all brigades within the BAOR were reorganised accordingly. The square brigade was developed in the 1950s. It called for a brigade to contain two armoured regiments and two mechanised infantry battalions. In the late 1960s, new anti-tank and defence in depth concepts were developed as fears of a possible surprise attack by the Warsaw Pact grew. Major-General Edwin Bramall promoted these new ideas when he took command of the 1st Division in January 1972. Bramall felt there was an over-reliance on the arrival of reinforcements to resist an offensive by the Soviet Union rather than the BAOR being able to do so itself. Using the division, the new tactics were refined and were later adopted by the BAOR, and further developed at a higher level in the mid-1970s. The basic concept was to draw Soviet armoured forces into kill zones along their anticipated route of advance. These zones would be mined, and Soviet tanks engaged by anti-tank guided missile-equipped infantry and tanks in hull down positions to inflict heavy casualties. BAOR would conduct a fighting withdrawal as needed using its own reinforcements to counterattack any Soviet breakthroughs. It was expected such methods would allow BAOR to resist an offensive for five days without receiving external reinforcements. Because this strategy required tanks to be used in a more-defensive manner, it ran counter to the then-established doctrine that called for tanks to be used in a more-offensive capacity and in a local counterattack role.

Between 1958-60 the Corps was reorganised into three mixed armour/infantry divisions including five brigade groups. In 1965 these brigade groups were brought together into three centralised divisions (1st, 2nd, and 4th). In 1958, the &quot;infantry&quot; designation was dropped from the 2nd Infantry Division&#x27;s title as part of this reorganisation. During the 1970s, 4th Division consisted of two &quot;square&quot; brigades.

With the end of National Service, manpower across the whole of BAOR dropped from around 77,000 to 55,000.

In the late 1970s the Corps was reorganised as four small five-battle-group armoured divisions plus a roughly brigade sized infantry &#x27;Field Force&#x27;. It then comprised:
* 1st Armoured Division
* 2nd Armoured Division
* 3rd Armoured Division
* 4th Armoured Division - formed 1978 and served with I (BR) Corps with its headquarters at Hammersmith Barracks in Herford.
* 5th Field Force

In 1981, John Nott, the Secretary of State for Defence for the government elected in 1979, announced the 1981 Defence White Paper. It, like the Mason Review, aimed to balance the British military in line with the nation&#x27;s financial resources and save manpower. Resultingly, the BAOR was restructured from four armoured divisions of two brigades, into a force of three divisions of three brigades.

Following the 1981-3 reorganisation, the Corps consisted of 1st and 4th Armoured Divisions, which would have manned the front line against the anticipated attack by the Soviet 3rd Shock Army, plus in an in-depth, reserve role the 3rd Armoured Division (United Kingdom) and finally the 2nd Infantry Division which was tasked with rear-area security. 3rd Armoured Division then comprised the 4th (based in Münster), the 6th (Soest), and the 33rd Armoured Brigades (Paderborn).

Formations from the early 1980s to the 1990s included:
* 1st Armoured Division (Verden)
** 7th Armoured Brigade
** 12th Armoured Brigade
** 22nd Armoured Brigade
* 3rd Armoured Division (Soest)
** 4th Armoured Brigade
** 6th Armoured Brigade
** 33rd Armoured Brigade
* 4th Armoured Division (Herford)
** 11th Armoured Brigade
** 20th Armoured Brigade
** 19th Infantry Brigade (in UK)
* 2nd Infantry Division (in UK)
** 15th Infantry Brigade (TA)
** 24th Airmobile Brigade
** 49th Infantry Brigade (TA)
* Artillery Division (HQ Ripon Barracks, Bielefeld)

During the 1980s, the 33rd Armoured Brigade joined the 4th Armoured Division and in exchange the 3rd Armoured Division received the 19th Infantry Brigade (Colchester, England). During 1983, the 6th Armoured Brigade converted into the 6th Airmobile Brigade and maintained that role until 1988.

With the end of the Cold War, in 1992 1 (BR) Corps was disbanded, and its HQ closed. Some of the staff serving in HQ 1(BR) Corps were reassigned to the new HQ United Kingdom Support Command (Germany) which was formed from the rump of HQ BAOR. The remainder of the staff formed the British component (50% of the total staff in the HQ) in the Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps (HQ ARRC), a newly instated multi-national NATO Rapid Reaction Corps HQ. The Corps Commander reported to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe SACEUR, but had no troops under command except when assigned to ARRC by NATO member nations, for operations or for exercises. HQ ARRC moved to Rheindahlen in 1994.

<text>Morning glory (also written as morning-glory) is the common name for over 1,000 species of flowering plants in the family Convolvulaceae, whose current taxonomy and systematics are in flux. Morning glory species belong to many genera, some of which are:
* &quot;Argyreia&quot;
* &quot;Astripomoea&quot;
* &quot;Calystegia&quot;
* &quot;Convolvulus&quot;
* &quot;Ipomoea&quot; (the largest genus)
* &quot;Lepistemon&quot;
* &quot;Merremia&quot;
* &quot;Operculina&quot;
* &quot;Rivea&quot;
* &quot;Stictocardia&quot;
As the name suggests, most &quot;morning&quot; glory flowers unfurl into full bloom in the early morning. The flowers usually start to fade a few hours before the corolla begins to display visible curling. They prefer full solar exposure throughout the day, and mesic soils. Some morning glories, such as &quot;Ipomoea muricata&quot;, &quot;Ipomoea alba&quot;, and &quot;Ipomoea macrorhiza&quot;, are night-blooming flowers.

== History ==

&quot;Ipomoea nil&quot;, a species of morning glory, was first known in China for its medicinal uses, due to the laxative properties of its seeds.

Ancient Mesoamerican civilizations used the morning glory species &quot;Ipomoea alba&quot; to convert the latex from the &quot;Castilla elastica&quot; tree and also the guayule plant to produce bouncing rubber balls. The sulfur in the morning glory&#x27;s juice served to vulcanize the rubber, a process antedating Charles Goodyear&#x27;s discovery by at least 3,000 years. Aztec priests in Mexico were also known to use the plant&#x27;s hallucinogenic properties (see &quot;Rivea corymbosa&quot;).

== Invasive species ==
In some places, such as Australian bushland, some species of morning glories develop thick roots and tend to grow in dense thickets. They can quickly spread by way of long, creeping stems. By crowding out, blanketing, and smothering other plants, morning glory has turned into a serious invasive weed problem.

In parts of the US, species such as &quot;Calystegia sepium&quot; (hedge bindweed), &quot;Ipomoea purpurea&quot; (common morning glory) and &quot;Ipomoea indica&quot; (blue morning glory) have shown to be invasive. In fact, as of 2021, most non-native species of &quot;Ipomoea&quot; are currently illegal to cultivate, possess, and sell in the U.S. state of Arizona, and before 4 January 2020, this ban applied to native species, too. This is because some species of Convolvulaceae (like &quot;Convolvulus arvensis&quot; and &quot;Ipomoea × leucantha&quot;) have been known to cause problems in crops, especially in cotton fields.&quot;&quot; &quot;Ipomoea aquatica&quot; is a federal noxious weed, though some states, like Texas, have acknowledged its status as a vegetable and allow it to be grown.

== Cultivation ==
In cultivation, most are treated as perennial plants in frost-free areas and as annual plants in colder climates, but some species tolerate winter cold. Some species are strictly annual (e.g. &quot;Ipomoea nil),&quot; producing many seeds, and some perennial species (e.g. &quot;I. indica&quot;) are propagated by cuttings. Some moonflowers, which flower at night, are also in the morning glory family.

Because of their fast growth, twining habit, attractive flowers, and tolerance for poor, dry soils, some morning glories are excellent vines for creating summer shade on building walls when trellised, thus keeping the building cooler and reducing heating and cooling costs.

Popular varieties in contemporary western cultivation include &#x27;Sunspots&#x27;, &#x27;Heavenly Blue&#x27;, moonflower, cypress vine, and cardinal climber. The cypress vine is a hybrid, with the cardinal climber as one parent.

Many morning glories self-seed in the garden. They have a hard seed coat, which delays germination until late spring. Germination may be improved by soaking in warm water.

Morning glory has been a favorite flower in Japan for many a long century. The cultivation started in the Nara period (8th century). The big booms of the selective breeding of the morning glory happened in the Edo era (17-19th century). The large-flowered morning glory was broadly cultivated as a hobby flower. The varied Japanese morning glory (変化朝顔 Henka-asagao or mutant morning glory) was created.
== Culinary uses ==

&quot;Ipomoea aquatica&quot;, known as water spinach, water morning glory, water convolvulus, &quot;ong-choy, kang-kung&quot;, or swamp cabbage, is popularly used as a green vegetable, especially in East and Southeast Asian cuisines. In the US, &quot;I. aquatica&quot; is a federal noxious weed, and can be illegal to grow, import, possess, or sell without a permit. A market exists, though, for the plant&#x27;s powerful culinary potential. As of 2005, the state of Texas has acknowledged that water spinach is a highly prized vegetable in many cultures, and has allowed it to be grown for personal consumption, in part because it is known to have been grown in Texas for more than 15 years and has not yet escaped cultivation.

The genus &quot;Ipomoea&quot; also contains the sweet potato (&quot;I. batatas&quot;). Though the term &quot;morning glory&quot; is not usually extended to &quot;I. batatas&quot;, sometimes it may be referred to as a &quot;tuberous morning glory&quot; in a horticultural context. Some cultivars of &quot;I. batatas&quot; are grown for their ornamental value, rather than for the edible tuber.
== Chemistry and ethnobotany ==

The seeds of many species of morning glory contain ergoline alkaloids such as the psychedelic ergonovine and ergine (LSA). Seeds of &quot;Ipomoea tricolor&quot; and &quot;Turbina corymbosa&quot; (syn. &quot;R. corymbosa&quot;) are used as psychedelics. The seeds of morning glory can produce a similar effect to LSD when taken in large doses, often numbering into the hundreds. Though the chemical LSA is not legal in some countries, the seeds are found in many gardening stores; however, some claim the seeds from commercial sources can sometimes be coated in some kind of pesticide or methylmercury (although the latter is illegal in the UK and the US).

<text>Tribonian (Greek: Τριβωνιανός [trivonia&#x27;nos], – 542) was a Byzantine jurist and advisor. During the reign of the Emperor Justinian I, he supervised the revision of the legal code of the Byzantine Empire. He has been described as one of the wisest collaborators of Justinian.

Tribonian was a Greek from Cyme, who studied law in Constantinople, where he became the most renowned legal scholar of his day. He was a close friend of Emperor Justinian, who appointed him to head the commission that compiled the &quot;Codex Justinianus&quot; and the &quot;Digest&quot;. Justinian also appointed Tribonian to high offices in the imperial administration, such as &quot;magister officiorum&quot; and &quot;quaestor sacri palatii&quot;, but at the beginning of the Nika riots he was forced to dismiss him on charges made by his enemies. Tribonian died in 542 of a disease, perhaps the plague.

== Biography ==
Tribonian was a Greek, born in Cyme, in Pamphylia (modern Side), around the year 485. He may have been a pagan. He was well educated and practiced law before the court of the praetorian prefect. Justinian made Tribonian &quot;magister officiorum&quot; (Master of Offices), although it is not clear when, and then appointed him &quot;quaestor sacri palatii&quot; in September 529.

In 528, before he was appointed quaestor, Tribonian was named by Justinian as one of the commissioners charged with preparing the new imperial legal code, the &quot;Codex Justinianeus&quot;, which subsequently was issued on April 7, 529. In 530, after Tribonian had become quaestor, it was natural for Justinian to put him in charge of the next major law reform project: compiling and harmonizing the writings of classical Roman jurists. Justinian&#x27;s main objects in creating this harmonized compilation of juristic writings were to shorten litigation (by clarifying the law), and to create a syllabus to be used at the law schools in Berytus (Beirut) and Constantinople. During the same period, Tribonian also was charged with carrying out another aspect of Justinian&#x27;s reforms in legal education and codification — creating a textbook for first-year law students by updating the &quot;Institutes&quot; of Gaius. Both the Digest and the new Institutes of Justinian were promulgated in December of 533. In 534, Justinian decided that so many new laws had been passed, and so many older ones harmonized, since the publication of his first Code in 529, a second edition was needed. Hence, the &quot;Codex repetitae praelectionis&quot; was published, entirely superseding the edition of 529, the text of which has been lost. 

In 532, Tribonian was removed as quaestor due to the charges of corruption made by his enemies during the Nika riots, but he continued to work on the codification. He was restored to his post as quaestor in 535 and continued in that position until his death. Tribonian continued to help draft new laws for Justinian; these new laws (Novellae Constitutiones) were later combined with the &quot;Codex Justinianus&quot;, the Digest and the &quot;Institutes&quot; to comprise the &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot;.

Tribonian died in 542 of a disease, perhaps the plague. Tribonian&#x27;s career is summarized by his noted modern biographer, Tony Honoré, in this way: &quot;...he was Justinian&#x27;s minister for legislation and propaganda for nearly twelve years...In these years the three volumes of the &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot; and most of the surviving legislation of Justinian&#x27;s reign were produced. He drafted about three-quarters of the surviving constitutions of Justinian&#x27;s reign. He planned and directed the work of the Second Law Commission, which produced the Digest, the Institutes and the Second &quot;Codex Iustinianus.&quot;

<doc id="267659" wikidata="Q197481" url="?curid=267659" title="Zhao Yun">
<text>Zhao Yun ( ) (died 229), courtesy name Zilong (), was a military general who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty and early Three Kingdoms period of China. Originally a subordinate of the northern warlord Gongsun Zan, Zhao Yun later came to serve another warlord, Liu Bei, and had since accompanied him on most of his military exploits, from the Battle of Changban (208) to the Hanzhong Campaign (217–219). He continued serving in the state of Shu Han – founded by Liu Bei in 221 – in the Three Kingdoms period and participated in the first of the Northern Expeditions until his death in 229. While many facts about Zhao Yun&#x27;s life remain unclear due to limited information in historical sources, some aspects and activities in his life have been dramatised or exaggerated in folklore and fiction. In the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, he was lauded as a member of the Five Tiger Generals under Liu Bei.

==Historical sources on Zhao Yun&#x27;s life==
Zhao Yun&#x27;s original biography in the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (&quot;Sanguozhi&quot;), written by Chen Shou in the third century, is only 346 Chinese characters long. In the fifth century, Pei Songzhi added annotations from the &quot;Zhao Yun Biezhuan&quot; (趙雲別傳; &quot;Unofficial Biography of Zhao Yun&quot;) to Zhao Yun&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, providing a relatively clear, though still incomplete picture of Zhao Yun&#x27;s life.

==Early career under Gongsun Zan==
Zhao Yun was from Zhending County, Changshan Commandery. The &quot;Zhao Yun Biezhuan&quot; described his physical appearance as follows: eight &quot;chi&quot; tall (approximately 1.84 metres), with majestic and impressive looks.

After receiving a recommendation from the Administrator of Changshan Commandery to serve in the government, Zhao Yun led a small group of volunteers to join Gongsun Zan, a warlord in You Province. Around the time, the warlord Yuan Shao had experienced a surge in fame after his recent appointment as the Governor of Ji Province, so Gongsun Zan was worried that many people in You Province would choose to serve under Yuan Shao instead of him.

When Zhao Yun showed up with his volunteers, Gongsun Zan asked him mockingly: &quot;I heard that all those in your home province wanted to serve the Yuans. Why did you have a change of heart, and decide to correct your mistake?&quot; Zhao Yun replied: &quot;The Empire is in a state of chaos, and it is unclear who is right and who is wrong. The people are in danger. Those in my home province, after careful deliberation, decided to follow a lord who governs with benevolence. Therefore, I chose to join you, General, instead of Lord Yuan.&quot; Gongsun Zan then accepted him. Zhao Yun later fought on Gongsun Zan&#x27;s side in some battles against rival forces.

==Meeting Liu Bei==
Around the early 190s, Zhao Yun met Liu Bei, who was taking shelter under Gongsun Zan at the time. Zhao Yun became very close to Liu Bei and desired to switch his allegiance to Liu Bei. When Gongsun Zan sent Liu Bei to assist his ally, Tian Kai, in a battle against Yuan Shao, Zhao Yun followed Liu Bei and served as a cavalry officer under Liu Bei.

When Zhao Yun received news of his elder brother&#x27;s death, he asked for a temporary leave of absence from Liu Bei to mourn his brother. Liu Bei knew that Zhao Yun would not return after leaving, so he held Zhao Yun&#x27;s hand while bidding him farewell. Before departing, Zhao Yun told Liu Bei: &quot;I will never forget your favour.&quot;

==Service under Liu Bei==
In early 200, after Liu Bei lost his base in Xu Province to his rival Cao Cao, he fled north across the Yellow River and sought refuge under Yuan Shao, Cao Cao&#x27;s rival. Around the same time, Zhao Yun also came to Ye, Yuan Shao&#x27;s headquarters, where he met Liu Bei again. Zhao Yun and Liu Bei shared the same room during their stay in Ye.

Liu Bei secretly instructed Zhao Yun to help him gather hundreds of men who were willing to follow him, and claim that they served under the General of the Left (). Yuan Shao was unaware of this. Zhao Yun then accompanied Liu Bei and his followers as they left Yuan Shao and headed south to join Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province.

===Battle of Bowang===
In 202, when Cao Cao was away on campaigns in northern China against Yuan Shao&#x27;s sons and their allies, Liu Bei took advantage of Cao Cao&#x27;s absence to launch an attack on Cao Cao&#x27;s territories in central China. Cao Cao sent his general Xiahou Dun and others to lead an army to resist Liu Bei.

During the battle, Zhao Yun captured Xiahou Lan (), an old friend who was from the same hometown as him. He requested that Liu Bei spare Xiahou Lan&#x27;s life and recommended Xiahou Lan to serve as a military judge because he knew that Xiahou Lan was knowledgeable about law. Zhao Yun earned praise for being conscientious and careful when he maintained a professional relationship with Xiahou Lan despite their friendship.

===Battle of Changban===


After Liu Biao died in 208, his younger son Liu Cong succeeded him as the Governor of Jing Province. When Cao Cao launched a military campaign in the same year to eliminate opposing forces in southern China, Liu Cong surrendered and yielded Jing Province to him. Liu Bei and his followers abandoned their stronghold in Xinye County and headed further south towards Xiakou, which was guarded by Liu Biao&#x27;s elder son Liu Qi and was independent of Cao Cao&#x27;s control.

Cao Cao personally led a 5,000-strong elite cavalry force to pursue Liu Bei. They caught up with Liu Bei at Changban and inflicted a devastating defeat on his forces. While Liu Bei abandoned his family and fled, Zhao Yun carried Liu Bei&#x27;s young son Liu Shan and protected Liu Bei&#x27;s wife Lady Gan (Liu Shan&#x27;s mother) during the battle and delivered them to safety. He was later promoted to the rank of General of the Standard () for his efforts.

Earlier on, after his defeat at Changban, Liu Bei heard rumours that Zhao Yun had betrayed him and defected to Cao Cao&#x27; side. Refusing to believe the rumours, he threw a short &quot;ji&quot; to the ground and said: &quot;Zilong will never abandon me.&quot; He was right as Zhao Yun returned to him a short while later.

In the winter of 208–209, Liu Bei formed an alliance with the warlord Sun Quan and they defeated Cao Cao at the decisive Battle of Red Cliffs. As Cao Cao retreated north after his defeat, Liu Bei and Sun Quan advanced and conquered Nan Commandery, which used to be under Cao Cao&#x27;s control.

===As the Administrator of Guiyang===
Zhao Yun was later promoted to Lieutenant-General () for his contributions towards Liu Bei&#x27;s conquests of the four commanderies in southern Jing Province: Changsha, Lingling, Wuling and Guiyang. After the capture of Guiyang Commandery, Liu Bei appointed Zhao Yun as the new Administrator to replace Zhao Fan.

Zhao Fan had a widowed sister-in-law who was famous for her beauty. He wanted to arrange for her to marry Zhao Yun so as to build connections with Zhao Yun. However, Zhao Yun rejected the idea and told Zhao Fan: &quot;We share the same family name. Your elder brother is also like an elder brother to me.&quot;

There were others who urged Zhao Yun to accept the marriage but Zhao Yun firmly refused and said: &quot;Zhao Fan was forced to surrender because of the circumstances. His intentions are unclear and suspicious. Besides, there are many other women in this world.&quot; Not long later, Zhao Fan escaped, and Zhao Yun was able to avoid any association with him because he did not agree to the marriage.

===Guarding Jing Province===
Around 211, Liu Bei led an army west into Yi Province to assist the provincial governor Liu Zhang in countering a rival warlord, Zhang Lu of Hanzhong Commandery. Zhao Yun and others remained behind to guard Jing Province.

Sometime in 209, Liu Bei married Sun Quan&#x27;s younger sister, Lady Sun, to strengthen the Sun–Liu alliance. Lady Sun also remained in Jing Province when Liu Bei left for Yi Province. As she saw herself as the sister of a powerful warlord, Lady Sun not only acted in an arrogant and unbridled manner, but also allowed her bodyguards and personal staff to behave lawlessly in Jing Province. For this reason, Liu Bei specially appointed Zhao Yun, whom he deemed a serious and conscientious person, to oversee domestic affairs in Jing Province and maintain law and order during his absence. When Sun Quan heard that Liu Bei had left for Yi Province, he sent a vessel to fetch his sister home. Lady Sun attempted to bring Liu Bei&#x27;s son Liu Shan along with her, but Zhao Yun and Zhang Fei led their men to stop her and retrieved Liu Shan.

The &quot;Chronicles of Han and Jin&quot; (漢晉春秋) written by the Jin historian Xi Zuochi gives a similar account to the one recorded into the &quot;Zhao Yun Biezhuan&quot;.

===Conquest of Yi Province===
Liu Bei and Liu Zhang were friendly towards each other in the beginning, but tensions between them gradually increased until the point of armed conflict around late 212. Liu Bei was initially stationed at Jiameng Pass (葭萌關; in present-day Zhaohua District, Guangyuan, Sichuan), where he was helping Liu Zhang defend the area from Zhang Lu. However, he turned against Liu Zhang later and attacked him. He ordered Zhuge Liang, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun and others to lead reinforcements from Jing Province into Yi Province to help him, while Guan Yu remained behind to defend Jing Province.

The reinforcements marched along the Yangtze River and conquered the commanderies and counties in the surrounding areas. When they reached Jiangzhou, Zhuge Liang ordered Zhao Yun to lead a separate force to attack Jiangyang Commandery (江陽郡; around present-day Neijiang, Sichuan) and take an alternate route, and later rendezvous with Liu Bei and the other armies outside Yi Province&#x27;s capital, Chengdu. In 214, Liu Zhang gave up resistance and surrendered to Liu Bei, who gained control over Yi Province. Zhao Yun was appointed as General of the Assisting Army ().

After taking Yi Province, Liu Bei held a discussion on how to distribute the households in Chengdu and the fields outside the city among his followers because he wanted to reward them for their efforts in the campaign. Zhao Yun objected: Liu Bei heeded Zhao Yun&#x27;s advice.

===Battle of Han River===
In 217, Liu Bei launched the Hanzhong Campaign to seize control of Hanzhong Commandery from Cao Cao because Hanzhong was the northern gateway into Yi Province. Liu Bei&#x27;s general Huang Zhong killed Cao Cao&#x27;s general Xiahou Yuan at the Battle of Mount Dingjun of 218–219.

After Xiahou Yuan&#x27;s defeat, Huang Zhong heard that enemy troops were transporting food supplies in the vicinity so he led a detachment of troops to attack the convoy and seize the supplies. When Huang Zhong did not return to camp in time, Zhao Yun led tens of horsemen out in search of Huang Zhong.

At the time, Cao Cao had sent his forces to attack Liu Bei&#x27;s positions. Zhao Yun encountered Cao Cao&#x27;s vanguard force and engaged them in battle until Cao Cao&#x27;s main force showed up and surrounded him. Despite the overwhelming odds, Zhao Yun attempted to charge and break through the enemy formation and alternated between fighting back and retreating. Cao Cao&#x27;s forces regrouped, got back into formation and surrounded Zhao Yun. Left with no choice, Zhao Yun had to fight his way out and head back to camp. During the battle, Zhao Yun&#x27;s deputy Zhang Zhu () was wounded but Zhao Yun turned back, saved him and brought him back to camp.

Cao Cao&#x27;s forces pursued Zhao Yun as he retreated back to his camp. Upon seeing the enemy&#x27;s approach, Zhao Yun&#x27;s subordinate Zhang Yi wanted to shut the camp&#x27;s gates and get the troops to hold their position. However, Zhao Yun ordered the gates to be opened, all flags and banners to be hidden, and the war drums to be silenced so as to create an illusion of an empty camp. Cao Cao&#x27;s forces thought that there was an ambush inside Zhao Yun&#x27;s camp so they withdrew. Just as they were retreating, Zhao Yun launched a counterattack and his men beat the war drums loudly and fired arrows at the enemy. Cao Cao&#x27;s soldiers were shocked and thrown into disarray. Some of them trampled on each other as they panicked and fled, while many of them fell into the Han River and drowned.

The following day, when Liu Bei came to inspect Zhao Yun&#x27;s camp and survey the battlefield, he remarked: &quot;Zilong is full of courage.&quot; He then threw a feast to celebrate Zhao Yun&#x27;s victory and they made merry until nightfall. Zhao Yun was also given the nickname &quot;General of Tiger&#x27;s Might&quot; ().

===Battle of Xiaoting===
In late 219, Sun Quan broke the Sun–Liu alliance by sending his general Lü Meng to launch a stealth invasion of Liu Bei&#x27;s territories in southern Jing Province while Guan Yu was away at the Battle of Fancheng against Cao Cao&#x27;s forces. Guan Yu was later captured in an ambush and executed on Sun Quan&#x27;s order when he refused to surrender.

Following Cao Cao&#x27;s death in March 220, his son and successor Cao Pi usurped the throne from Emperor Xian later that year, ended the Eastern Han dynasty, and established the state of Wei with himself as the new emperor. In 221, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and founded the state of Shu to challenge Wei&#x27;s legitimacy. In the same year, Sun Quan pledged allegiance to Cao Pi and agreed to become a vassal under Wei; in return, Cao Pi granted him the title &quot;King of Wu&quot;.

Liu Bei bore a grudge against Sun Quan for the loss of Jing Province and wanted to attack Sun Quan. Zhao Yun attempted to dissuade him by saying: 

Liu Bei ignored Zhao Yun&#x27;s advice and proceeded with his quest for vengeance by personally leading a military campaign against Sun Quan. He left Zhao Yun behind to guard Jiangzhou.

In October 222, Liu Bei suffered a devastating defeat at the Battle of Xiaoting against Sun Quan&#x27;s forces, and was forced to retreat to Baidicheng. By the time Zhao Yun showed up with reinforcements at Yong&#x27;an, Sun Quan&#x27;s forces had given up on pursuing Liu Bei and retreated back to Wu.

==Service under Liu Shan==
After Liu Bei died in June 223, his son Liu Shan succeeded him as the emperor of Shu, with the Imperial Chancellor Zhuge Liang serving as regent because Liu Shan was still underage at the time. Following his coronation, Liu Shan appointed Zhao Yun as Central Protector of the Army () and General Who Attacks the South (), and enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Yongchang Village (). He promoted Zhao Yun to the position of General Who Guards the East () later.

===Battle of Ji Valley===
In 227, Zhao Yun moved to the staging area at Hanzhong Commandery to join Zhuge Liang, who had mobilised military forces from throughout Shu in preparation for a large-scale military campaign against Shu&#x27;s rival state, Wei.

In the spring of 228, Zhuge Liang ordered Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi to lead a detachment of troops to Ji Valley () and pretend to attack Mei County (郿縣; southeast of present-day Fufeng County, Shaanxi) via Xie Valley (). Their mission was to distract and hold the Wei general Cao Zhen&#x27;s attention, while Zhuge Liang led the Shu main army to attack Mount Qi (祁山; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu).

Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi lost to Cao Zhen at the battle in Ji Valley because Zhuge Liang had given them command of the weaker soldiers while he led the better troops to attack Mount Qi. Nevertheless, Zhao Yun managed to rally his men into putting up a firm defence as they retreated, thus minimising their losses.

After the Shu forces managed to retreat back to Hanzhong, Zhao Yun was demoted to the position of General Who Guards the Army () as punishment for his defeat at Ji Valley. During this time, Zhuge Liang asked Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi: &quot;When our troops withdrew from Jieting, they were very disorganised. However, those who retreated from Ji Valley were orderly. Why is it so?&quot; Deng Zhi replied: &quot;(Zhao) Yun personally led the rearguard. He ensured that our troops retreated in an orderly manner and left no equipment behind.&quot;

As Zhao Yun still had some silk left in his unit, Zhuge Liang wanted to distribute it among the troops to raise their morale. However, Zhao Yun disagreed: &quot;The campaign was a failure, so why should rewards be given out? Please store the silk in the official treasury now and distribute it among the men later during the tenth month as a season gift for winter.&quot; Zhuge Liang heeded Zhao Yun&#x27;s suggestion.

==Death and posthumous honours==
Zhao Yun died in 229. Zhao was posthumously honoured as &quot;Marquis Shunping&quot; () by Liu Shan in April or May 261.

During Liu Bei&#x27;s reign, only Fa Zheng received posthumous honours. In Liu Shan&#x27;s time, only three consecutive heads of government – Zhuge Liang, Jiang Wan and Fei Yi – received posthumous titles. Later, Liu Shan also posthumously honoured Chen Zhi, whom he favoured, and Xiahou Ba, a Wei general who defected to Shu. Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Ma Chao, Pang Tong, Huang Zhong and Zhao Yun were also awarded posthumous titles by Liu Shan as well. At the time, it was a great honour for a person to receive a posthumous title.

Liu Shan&#x27;s imperial edict for awarding Zhao Yun his posthumous title read: &quot;Zhao Yun followed the Late Emperor and he made outstanding contributions. I was young then and experienced many difficulties, but I relied on his loyalty and faithfulness to get out of danger. I bestow this posthumous name on him to recognise him for his meritorious service and also because there were others who advised me to do so.&quot;

The name of Zhao Yun&#x27;s posthumous title was suggested by Jiang Wei and others – &quot;shun&quot; (; literally &quot;obey / follow&quot;) because he was virtuous and kind, &quot;ping&quot; (; literally &quot;peace / pacify&quot;) because he performed his duties up to standard and overcame chaos, so &quot;shun&quot; and &quot;ping&quot; became &quot;Shunping&quot;.

==Family==
Zhao Yun&#x27;s eldest son, Zhao Tong (), served as an officer in the &quot;huben&quot; () division of the imperial guards.

Zhao Yun&#x27;s second son, Zhao Guang (), served as an Officer of the Standard (). He accompanied the Shu general Jiang Wei in the campaigns against Wei, and was killed in action in Tazhong (沓中; northwest of present-day Zhugqu County, Gansu).

==Appraisal==

Chen Shou, who wrote Zhao Yun&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, commented on Zhao Yun as follows: &quot;Huang Zhong and Zhao Yun were fierce and mighty warriors, just like claws and teeth. Were they the successors to Guan and Teng?&quot;

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Many of Zhao Yun&#x27;s actual exploits were highly dramatised in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. In the novel, Zhao Yun is portrayed as an almost perfect warrior – one who possesses powerful combat skills, unwavering loyalty to his lord, tremendous courage, keen intelligence, and serene charisma. These traits have often been reflected in nearly all modern materials about Zhao Yun to date.

See the following for some fictitious stories in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; involving Zhao Yun:
*Battle of Changban#In Romance of the Three Kingdoms
*Battle of Xiaoting#In Romance of the Three Kingdoms

==In popular culture==

Zhao Yun has been featured prominently in Chinese and Japanese popular culture, literature, art and anecdotes. Zhao Yun was already a relatively well-known hero from the Three Kingdoms period, as folktales about his exploits have been passed down through centuries. He became a household name due to the popularity of the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;.

===Religion===
Zhao Yun sometimes appears as a door god in Chinese and Taoist temples in Henan, usually in partnership with Ma Chao.

===Folklore===
Zhao Yun is strongly associated with the color white in several Three Kingdoms media, which is a callback to his appearance as stated in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. People can see an interpretation of him in the Summer Palace, which has a famous painting of his heroics at Changban. White is linked to several positive traits within various fictional mediums, including honesty, virtue, purity and so on. One other reason for Zhao Yun being linked with the color may be due to a myth regarding the horse the general favored. A quick steed in its own right, it is fabled to run one thousand leagues during the day and five hundred leagues at night. The horse&#x27;s name is supposedly the &quot;White Dragon Horse&quot; (白龍駒, &quot;Bailongju&quot;).

Another strong image for Zhao Yun in various Three Kingdoms fiction is the idea of him wielding a spear, often said to be a long spear. Its name is roughly translated as &quot;Shore Edge Spear&quot; (涯角槍, &quot;Yajiaoqiang&quot;) in legends and it allegedly makes an unnamed appearance in the &quot;Sanguozhi Pinghua&quot;. The weapon&#x27;s revered namesake means that it &quot;[has] none surpassing it, even in the heavenly sea of stars&quot;. Measuring in at a length of nine &quot;chi&quot; (approximately three meters or ten feet in modern conversions), Zhao Yun is said to have wielded it with magnificent skill. If one is to believe the tales, Zhao Yun used the same spear to defeat Zhang Fei in a duel. At times, Zhao Yun is associated with one of Cao Cao&#x27;s twin swords from &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. In this tale, he killed Xiahou En while rescuing A Dou from peril.

There is a Chinese folktale about Zhao Yun&#x27;s death which is not mentioned in the 14th-century novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. In this story, Zhao Yun had never been wounded in battle before so there were no scars on his body. One day, while he was taking a bath, his wife pricked him with a sewing needle out of mischief. Zhao Yun began to bleed profusely and eventually died of shock.

===Film and television===
The 2008 Hong Kong film &quot;Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon&quot; is loosely based on stories related to Zhao Yun in the historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. It was directed by Daniel Lee and starred Hong Kong actor Andy Lau as &quot;Zhao Zilong&quot;. Mainland Chinese actor Hu Jun portrayed Zhao Yun in John Woo&#x27;s &quot;Red Cliff&quot;, a two-part epic war film based on the Battle of Red Cliffs.

Notable actors who have portrayed Zhao Yun in television series include: Zhang Shan, in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (1994); Nie Yuan, in &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot; (2010), Benji Wang in &quot;K.O.3an Guo&quot; (2010), and Lin Gengxin in &quot;God of War, Zhao Yun&quot; (2016).

===Video games===
Zhao Yun is one of the Five Tiger Generals that must be recruited by the player in the NES RPG &quot;Destiny of an Emperor&quot;.

Zhao Yun appears as a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; video game series. He is usually featured prominently on the cover of each title, and is most often used by the developers in screenshots and other promotional materials for upcoming releases. He also appears in all instalments of Koei&#x27;s &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; strategy game series.

The playable champion Xin Zhao in the multiplayer online battle arena game &quot;League of Legends&quot; is based on Zhao Yun. Zhao Yun also appears as a playable character in &quot;Lost Saga&quot;, &quot;Honor of Kings&quot;, &quot;Arena of Valor&quot;, &quot;Heroes Evolved&quot; and &quot;Mobile Legends: Bang Bang&quot;. He was later renamed to &quot;Zilong&quot; by the latter.

Zhao Yun appears as a Hero in the 2019 grand strategy game Total War: Three Kingdoms.

Zhao Yun appears as a stray Rider-class Servant in the 2023 video game Fate/Samurai Remnant, specifically in their third DLC titled: &quot;Bailong and the Crimson Demon&quot;. His Noble Phantasm, &quot;Lone Charge at Changban&quot;, is based on his exploits during the Battle of Changban.
