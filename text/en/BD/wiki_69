<text>Little Italy is the catch-all name for an ethnic enclave populated primarily by Italians or people of Italian ancestry, usually in an urban neighborhood. The concept of &quot;Little Italy&quot; holds many different aspects of the Italian culture. There are shops selling Italian goods as well as Italian restaurants lining the streets. A &quot;Little Italy&quot; strives essentially to have a version of the country of Italy placed in the middle of a large non-Italian city. This sort of enclave is often the result of periods of Italian immigration, during which people of the same culture settled or were ostracized and segregated together in certain areas. As cities modernized and grew, these areas became known for their ethnic associations, and ethnic neighborhoods like &quot;Little Italy&quot; blossomed, becoming the areas they are today.

<text>Gerald de l&#x27;Etang Duckworth (29 October 1870 – 28 September 1937) was an English publisher, who founded the London company that bears his name. Henry James and John Galsworthy were among the firm&#x27;s early authors.

==Background and early life==

Duckworth was a son of Herbert Duckworth, a London barrister, by his wife Julia Jackson. His father was the youngest son of William Duckworth of Orchardleigh in Somerset. His middle name, &quot;de l&#x27;Etang&quot;, was the surname of one of his mother&#x27;s ancestors, Antoine de l&#x27;Etang, a page to Queen Marie Antoinette. His mother was a niece of Julia Margaret Cameron, the photographer, after whom she was named.

Duckworth&#x27;s father died before his birth. When he was eight his mother married the author Leslie Stephen and had four more children: Virginia Stephen, later the author Virginia Woolf, the painter Vanessa Bell, and two sons, Thoby and Adrian Stephen. Gerald and his elder brother George were later accused by Virginia and Vanessa of sexually abusing them when they were children and teenagers. Woolf published her first two novels with her brother&#x27;s help, before forming the Hogarth Press.

Gerald Duckworth was educated at Eton College and Clare College, Cambridge.

==Career==
In 1898, Duckworth founded the publishing company that bears his name, Gerald Duckworth and Company Ltd, in Henrietta Street, Covent Garden. In his first year, 1898–1899, he published Henry James&#x27;s &quot;In the Cage&quot;; Leslie Stephen&#x27;s &quot;English Literature and Society in the Eighteenth Century&quot;; &quot;Jocelyn&quot; by John Sinjohn, a pseudonym of John Galsworthy; a translation of August Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;Der Vater&quot;; and &quot;Mother Goose in Prose&quot;, the first children&#x27;s book by L. Frank Baum, and the first book illustrated by Maxfield Parrish. (Baum&#x27;s most famous work, &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, was published in Chicago a year later.)

Edward Garnett (whose son David would marry Duckworth&#x27;s niece Angelica Bell) was Duckworth&#x27;s reader for nearly twenty years. The firm published W. H. Hudson, Charles M. Doughty, D. H. Lawrence, Evelyn Waugh, Virginia Woolf, and most of the work of Edith Sitwell, Osbert Sitwell, and Sacheverell Sitwell. It published all of John Galsworthy&#x27;s plays between 1909 and 1929.

In 1929, Galsworthy was shocked that Duckworth required him to sign all 1,250 copies of a limited edition of his collected plays. But when told he would get a royalty of 15s. 9d. per copy, he set up his watch and said: &quot;Let&#x27;s see how long it takes me to earn £984 7s. 6d.&quot;

Duckworth died in Milan, Italy, in 1937, but the firm continued to thrive. It marked its centenary in 1998, but then ran into financial troubles in 2003. It was bought out by Peter Mayer, although it has continued to publish under the name of Duckworth.

==Representations==
Three portraits of Duckworth are held by the National Portrait Gallery. Anthony Powell became Duckworth&#x27;s literary editor in 1926, and the publisher &quot;Judkins &amp; Judkins&quot; in his novel, &quot;What&#x27;s Become of Waring&quot; (1939), is modelled on Duckworth&#x27;s.

==Family==
On 2 March 1921, Duckworth married Cecil Alice Scott-Chad (born 1891), the daughter of Charles Scott-Chad, a barrister, and cousin of the footballing barrister George Scott-Chad. She and Duckworth had no children.

Duckworth&#x27;s older brother Sir George Herbert Duckworth (1868–1934) was private secretary to Austen Chamberlain. He became the grandfather of Anthony Duckworth-Chad. His sister Stella (1869–1897) married John Waller Hills, but died three months later.

<doc id="265594" wikidata="Q2397030" url="?curid=265594" title="Block and tackle">
<text>A block and tackle or only ]]tackle is a system of two or more pulleys with a rope or cable threaded between them, usually used to lift heavy loads.

The pulleys are assembled to form blocks and then blocks are paired so that one is fixed and one moves with the load. The rope is threaded through the pulleys to provide mechanical advantage that amplifies the force applied to the rope.

Hero of Alexandria described cranes formed from assemblies of pulleys in the first century. Illustrated versions of Hero&#x27;s &quot;Mechanica&quot; (a book on raising heavy weights) show early block and tackle systems.

== Overview ==

A block is a set of pulleys or sheaves mounted on a single frame. An assembly of blocks with a rope threaded through the pulleys is called tackle. The process of threading ropes or cables through blocks is called &quot;reeving&quot;, and a threaded block and tackle is said to have been &quot;rove&quot;. A block and tackle system amplifies the tension force in the rope to lift heavy loads. They are common on boats and sailing ships, where tasks are often performed manually, as well as on cranes and drilling rigs, where once rove, the tasks are performed by heavy equipment.

In the diagram shown here, the number of rope sections of the tackles shown is as follows:
* Gun tackle: 2
* Luff tackle: 3
* Double tackle: 4
* Gyn tackle: 5
* Threefold purchase: 6

Note that in the gun tackle, double tackle and threefold purchase, both blocks have the same number of pulleys (one, two and three, respectively) whereas the Luff tackle and Gyn tackle have mis-matched blocks with differing numbers of pulleys.

== Mechanical advantage ==

A block and tackle is characterized by the use of a single continuous rope to transmit a tension force around one or more pulleys to lift or move a load. Its mechanical advantage is the number of parts of the rope that act on the load. The mechanical advantage of a tackle dictates how much easier it is to haul or lift the load.

If frictional losses are neglected, the mechanical advantage of a block and tackle is equal to the number of parts in the line that either attach to or run through the moving blocks—in other words, the number of supporting rope sections.

An ideal block and tackle with a moving block supported by &quot;n&quot; rope sections has the mechanical advantage (MA),
formula_1
where FA is the hauling (or input) force and FB is the load.

Consider the set of pulleys that form the moving block and the parts of the rope that support this block. If there are &quot;n&quot; of these parts of the rope supporting the load &quot;FB,&quot; then a force balance on the moving block shows that the tension in each of the parts of the rope must be &quot;FB/n.&quot; This means the input force on the rope is &quot;FA&quot;=&quot;FB/n.&quot; Thus, the block and tackle reduces the input force by the factor &quot;n.&quot;

Ideal mechanical advantage correlates directly with velocity ratio. The velocity ratio of a tackle is the ratio between the velocity of the hauling line to that of the hauled load. A line with a mechanical advantage of 4 has a velocity ratio of 4:1. In other words, to raise a load at 1 metre per second, the hauling part of the rope must be pulled at 4 metres per second. Therefore, the mechanical advantage of a double tackle is 4.

===Rove to (dis)advantage===
The mechanical advantage of any tackle can be increased by interchanging the fixed and moving blocks so the rope is attached to the moving block and the rope is pulled in the direction of the lifted load. In this case the block and tackle is said to be &quot;rove to advantage.&quot;

* &quot;Rove to advantage&quot; – where the pull on the rope is in the same direction as that in which the load is to be moved. The hauling part is pulled from the moving block.
* &quot;Rove to disadvantage&quot; – where the pull on the rope is in the opposite direction to that in which the load is to be moved. The hauling part is pulled from the fixed block.

Diagram 3 shows three rope parts supporting the load &quot;W&quot;, which means the tension in the rope is &quot;W/3&quot;. Thus, the mechanical advantage is three-to-one.

By adding a pulley to the fixed block of a gun tackle the direction of the pulling force is reversed though the mechanical advantage remains the same, Diagram 3a. This is an example of the Luff tackle.
The decision of which to use depends on pragmatic considerations for the total ergonomics of working with a particular situation. Reeving to advantage is the most efficient use of equipment and resources. For example, if the load is to be hauled parallel to the ground, reeving to advantage enables the pulling force to be in the direction of the load movement, allowing obstacles to be managed more easily.

Reeving to disadvantage adds an extra sheave to change the direction of the pulling line to a potentially more ergonomic direction, which increases friction losses without improving the velocity ratio. Situations in which reeving to disadvantage may be more desirable include lifting from a fixed point overhead--the additional pulley allows pulling downwards instead of upwards so that the weight of the lifter can offset the weight of the load, or allows pulling sideways, enabling multiple lifters to combine effort.

=== Friction ===

The formula used to find the effort required to raise a given weight using a block and fall:

formula_2

where formula_3 is the force applied to the hauling part of the line (the input force), formula_4 is the weight of the load (the output force), formula_5 is the ideal mechanical advantage of the system (which is the same as the number of segments of line extending from the moving block), and formula_6 is the mechanical efficiency of the system (equal to one for an ideal frictionless system; a fraction less than one for real-world systems with energy losses due to friction and other causes). If formula_7 is the number of sheaves in the purchase, and there is a roughly formula_8% loss of efficiency at each sheave due to friction, then:

formula_9

This approximation is more accurate for smaller values of formula_7 and formula_8. A more precise estimate of efficiency is possible by use of the sheave friction factor, formula_12 (which may be obtainable from the manufacturer or published tables). The relevant equation is:

formula_13

Typical formula_12 values are 1.04 for roller bearing sheaves and 1.09 for plain bearing sheaves (with wire rope).

The increased force produced by a tackle is offset by both the increased length of rope needed and the friction in the system. In order to raise a block and tackle with a mechanical advantage of 6 a distance of 1 metre, it is necessary to pull 6 metres of rope through the blocks. Frictional losses also mean there is a practical point at which the benefit of adding a further sheave is offset by the incremental increase in friction which would require additional force to be applied in order to lift the load. Too much friction may result in the tackle not allowing the load to be released easily, or by the reduction in force needed to move the load being judged insufficient because undue friction has to be overcome as well.

== Mid-line attachment==
When installing a block on an existing line, it is often inconvenient at best to thread the rope through the block to be added.

*Open blocks have a space wide enough between the fixed cheeks to be able to slide the pulley over the rope. These can be extremely small and light while retaining significant strength due to the lack of moving parts.

*A swing cheek block is a special kind of block which can be opened to engage with a bight, without the necessity to thread the rope through the block or remove the load from the end of the rope. The snatch block is also the load lifting pulley in certain arrangements, such as during use in a recovery operation.


Swing cheek blocks may be roughly divided into two categories:

* Swing cheek pulleys: used for light loads or redirection of forces, usually with a single pulley wheel (though multiple sheaves/cheeks are not uncommon) and an attachment point (or several) for a carabiner or sling. The cheeks are not fixed or locked in position aside from the device used to secure them to the load or rigging point. 
::Examples of use (in an arboricultural setting) include: tail minding/tending, and for setting a rigging point in the tree above the cut to take place—a positive rigging situation.

*Snatch or impact blocks: used for heavier loads and more dynamic rigging, the cheeks of these blocks are fixed in place with a pin which locks into the opposite cheek. This pin may form part of the axle for a second pulley, which is secured to the load or rigging point with a soft sling, rather than a solid device such as a shackle. This allows for more even distribution of forces to the faces where the forces will be applied, as opposed to a carabiner or shackle, where the forces are applied more strongly to corners and edges, increasing risk of deformation or damage.
::Examples of use (again, in relation to tree care) may include setting a block below the current cut, resulting in a &#x27;negative&#x27; rigging situation, in which shock loads can be significant—especially if removing large sections of vertical stem.

<text>Many major railway stations that are involved in intermodal passenger transport are assigned codes by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), similar to IATA airport codes. Such railway stations are typically used in air-rail alliances or code sharing agreements (commonly known as &quot;Rail Fly&quot;) between airlines and rail lines, particularly in Europe. By assigning railway stations an IATA code, passengers on trips involving those stations can be ticketed all the way through the journey, including being checked straight through to their final destination, without the bother of having to claim their baggage and check-in again when changing between the rail and air portions of a trip. At other places, passengers have to carry their baggage onto the train, but need no separate train booking process.

==Railway station codes==
The IATA codes for railway stations normally begin with Q, X or Z, except when the station shares the code with an airport. For some smaller cities the railway station in the city has the same code as the airport outside the city (several kilometers distance). A connection involving transfer between them can appear when searching travel possibilities. A taxi ride, a train, or a bus transfer is usually needed then.

<doc id="265603" wikidata="Q1584058" url="?curid=265603" title="Puck (magazine)">
<text>Puck was the first successful humor magazine in the United States of colorful cartoons, caricatures and political satire of the issues of the day. It was founded in 1876 as a German-language publication by Joseph Keppler, an Austrian immigrant cartoonist. &quot;Puck&quot;&#x27;s first English-language edition was published in 1877, covering issues like New York City&#x27;s Tammany Hall, presidential politics, and social issues of the late 19th century to the early 20th century.

&quot;Puckish&quot; means &quot;childishly mischievous&quot;. This led Shakespeare&#x27;s Puck character (from &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;) to be recast as a charming near-naked boy and used as the title of the magazine. &quot;Puck&quot; was the first magazine to carry illustrated advertising and the first to successfully adopt full-color lithography printing for a weekly publication.

&quot;Puck&quot; was published from 1876 until 1918.

==Publication history==
After working with &quot;Leslie&#x27;s Illustrated Weekly&quot; in New York – a well-established magazine at the time – Keppler created a satirical magazine called &quot;Puck,&quot;. The weekly magazine was founded by Keppler in St. Louis, Missouri. Keppler had begun publishing German-language periodicals in 1869, though they failed. In 1871, he attempted another cartoon weekly, &quot;Puck&quot;, which lasted until August 1872. Then in 1876, he again began publishing &quot;Puck&quot; in German. Interested backers wanted &quot;Puck&quot; in English so he published it in both languages for 15 years until he ceased the German version.

In 1877, after gaining wide support for an English version of &quot;Puck,&quot; Keppler published its first issue in English. The first English edition was 16 pages long and was sold for 16 cents.

Sometime before 1887, &quot;Puck&quot; moved its editorial offices from St. Louis to New York City.

In May 1893, Puck Press published &quot;A Selection of Cartoons from Puck by Joseph Keppler (1877–1892)&quot; featuring 56 cartoons chosen by Keppler as his best work. Also during 1893, Keppler temporarily moved to Chicago and published a smaller-format, 12-page version of &quot;Puck&quot; from the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair grounds. Shortly thereafter, Joseph Keppler died, and Henry Cuyler Bunner, editor of &quot;Puck&quot; since 1877 continued the magazine until his own death in 1896. Harry Leon Wilson replaced Bunner and remained editor until he resigned in 1902. Joseph Keppler Jr. then became the editor.

The English-language magazine continued in operation for more than 40 years under several owners and editors, until it was bought by the William Randolph Hearst company in 1916 (ironically, one 1906 cartoon mocked Hearst&#x27;s bid for Congress with his newspapers&#x27; cartoon characters). The Hearst conglomerate discontinued the political material and switched to fine art and social fads. Within 2 years, subscriptions fell off and Hearst stopped publication; the final edition was distributed on September 5, 1918.

===London edition===
A London edition of &quot;Puck&quot; was published between January 1889 and June 1890. Among contributors was the English cartoonist and political satirist Tom Merry.

== Content ==
The magazine consisted of 16 pages measuring 10 inches by 13.5 inches with front and back covers in color and a color double-page centerfold. The cover always quoted Puck saying, &quot;What fools these mortals be!&quot; The jaunty symbol of Puck is conceived as a putto in a top hat who admires himself in a hand-mirror. He appears not only on the magazine covers but over the entrance to the Puck Building in New York&#x27;s Nolita neighborhood, where the magazine was published, as well.

&quot;Puck&quot; gained notoriety for its witty, humorous cartoons and was the first to publish weekly cartoons using chromolithography in place of wood engraving, offering three cartoons instead of one. In its early years of publication, &quot;Puck&quot;&#x27;s cartoons were largely printed in black and white, though later editions featured colorful, eye-catching lithographic prints in vivid color. A typical 32-page issue contained a full-color political cartoon on the front cover and a color non-political cartoon or comic strip on the back cover. There was always a double-page color centerfold, usually on a political topic. There were numerous black-and-white cartoons used to illustrate humorous anecdotes. A page of editorials commented on the issues of the day, and the last few pages were devoted to advertisements.

==Contributors==
Over the years, &quot;Puck&quot; employed many early cartoonists of note, including, Louis Dalrymple, Bernhard Gillam, Friedrich Graetz, Livingston Hopkins, Frederick Burr Opper, Louis Glackens, Albert Levering, Frank Nankivell, J. S. Pughe, Rose O&#x27;Neill, Charles Taylor, James Albert Wales, and Eugene Zimmerman.

==Puck Building==

&quot;Puck&quot; was housed from 1887 in the landmark Chicago-style, Romanesque Revival Puck Building at Lafayette and Houston streets, New York City. The steel-frame building was designed by architects Albert and Herman Wagner in 1885, as the world&#x27;s largest lithographic pressworks under a single roof, with its own electricity-generating dynamo. It takes up a full block on Houston Street, bounded by Lafayette and Mulberry streets.

== Legacy ==
Years after its conclusion, the &quot;Puck&quot; name and slogan were revived as part of the &quot;Comic Weekly&quot; Sunday comic section that ran on Hearst&#x27;s newspaper chain beginning in September 1931 and continuing until the 1970s. It was then revived again by Hearst&#x27;s &quot;Los Angeles Herald Examiner&quot;, which folded in 1989.

== Archives ==
A collection of &quot;Puck&quot; cartoons dating from 1879 to 1903 is maintained by the Special Collections Research Center within the Gelman Library of The George Washington University. The Library of Congress also has an extensive collection of &quot;Puck&quot; Magazine prints online. The Florida Atlantic University Libraries Special Collections Department also maintains a collection of both English and German edition &quot;Puck&quot; cartoons dating from 1878 to 1916.

<text>The Puck Building is a mixed-use building at 295–309 Lafayette Street in the SoHo and Nolita neighborhoods of Manhattan in New York City, New York, U.S. The building was designed by Albert Wagner in the Romanesque Revival style, with elements inspired by the German Rundbogenstil style. It is composed of two sections: the original seven-story building to the north and a nine-story southern annex. The Lafayette Street elevation of the facade was designed by Herman Wagner in a similar style to the original building. The Puck Building is a New York City designated landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Puck Building occupies the block bounded by Lafayette, Houston, Mulberry, and Jersey streets. The red brick facade is divided vertically into bays of uniform width. The facade is also divided horizontally into several tiers of arcades, with wider arches at the top and narrower arches at the bottom. The sculptor Henry Baerer crafted two sculptures of the Shakespeare character Puck for the facade. The building is topped by a penthouse structure. The original interiors were arranged as open plan offices, which largely remained intact in the late 20th century. There is retail space in the basement and first two stories; office and studio space on the intermediate stories; and six penthouse apartments on the highest stories.

The building was the longtime home of &quot;Puck&quot; magazine, a humor cartoon whose founders Joseph Keppler and Adolph Schwarzmann acquired the site in 1885 with J. Ottmann. The original building was completed the following year, and the annex was built between 1892 and 1893. When Lafayette Street was extended through the neighborhood in the late 1890s, the western section of the building was demolished, and a new facade and entrance were built on Lafayette Street. &quot;Puck&quot; magazine went out of business in 1918, and the structure was used by printing firms over the next several decades. Paul Serra&#x27;s family bought the Puck Building in 1978, and Serra and his partner Peter Gee converted it to commercial condominiums, which were completed in 1983. A syndicate led by Harry Skydell bought the Puck Building in 1986 and carried out additional renovation. Kushner Properties, a partner in the syndicate, took over the building in the 1990s. The lowest stories were converted to a store in 2011, and Kushner Properties converted the upper stories to penthouse apartments between 2011 and 2013, constructing a dormer for one of the apartments.

== Site ==
The Puck Building is at 295–309 Lafayette Street, in the Nolita and SoHo neighborhoods of Manhattan in New York City, New York, U.S.. It occupies an entire city block between Lafayette Street to the west, Houston Street to the north, Mulberry Street to the east, and Jersey Street to the south. The land lot is quadrilateral and measures around . Across the street to the southeast are St. Patrick&#x27;s Old Cathedral and St. Patrick&#x27;s Old Cathedral School. In addition, an entrance to the New York City Subway&#x27;s Broadway–Lafayette Street/Bleecker Street station is directly outside the building to the north. There are glass-and-iron vaulted sidewalks around the building; the vaulted sidewalks on Mulberry Street have all been replaced, but those on Houston and Lafayette streets are largely intact.

Prior to the construction of the Puck Building, the site had been occupied by St. Catherine&#x27;s Convent, which was built by the Order of the Sisters of Mercy in 1848. The convent was located at 35 East Houston Street, and the adjacent House of Mercy was at 33 East Houston Street. When the building was erected in the 1880s, it was at the southern end of Manhattan&#x27;s printing district, which was centered around the Astor Library Building. Furthermore, there were numerous publishers, printing firms, and publications headquartered in the neighborhood. These firms had settled in the neighborhood in part because of their proximity to the New York and New Haven Railroad&#x27;s freight terminal, which was several blocks south on Canal Street between Centre and Lafayette streets.

At the time of the building&#x27;s construction, Lafayette Street did not exist at the intersection with Houston Street. What is now known as Lafayette Street was two separate streets: Lafayette Place to the north and Elm Street to the south. These two streets were connected between 1897 and 1905. Because of the construction of Lafayette Street, part of the original building has been demolished. Before the original building was truncated, it carried an address of 31–39 East Houston Street.

== Architecture ==
The Puck Building was designed by Albert Wagner and was built for &quot;Puck&quot; magazine and the J. Ottmann Lithographing Company. It is designed in the Romanesque Revival style, with elements inspired by the German Rundbogenstil style. It was constructed in two parts: The north section was built in 1885–1986 and the south addition in 1892–1993. The front of the building on Lafayette Street was relocated in 1899 when the street (then called Elm Place) was widened. Herman Wagner was the architect for the renovated facade.

=== Facade ===
The current Puck Building is composed of the original structure to the north, which dates from 1885, and the annex to the south, which dates from 1892. In both sections of the building, the western elevation of the facade, along Lafayette Street, dates from 1898. The Lafayette Street elevation is stylistically similar to the original facades of both the original building and the annex. The original building is seven stories high, while the annex is nine stories high. The building&#x27;s facade includes gilded statues of Shakespeare&#x27;s character Puck, from &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;; the sculptor Henry Baerer created two such statues for the building.

Every elevation of the facade is divided vertically into bays of uniform width. The original building measures three bays wide (originally five bays) on Houston Street to the north, six bays wide on Mulberry Street to the east, and four bays wide on Lafayette Street to the west. The southern annex is five bays wide on Mulberry Street and six bays wide on Lafayette Street. The southern elevation on Jersey Street is clad in plain brick and has a small number of window openings with iron shutters. The bays are separated vertically by projecting brick piers, which rise atop granite pedestals. The rest of the facade is made of red brick, except for the cast iron window frames and statues, as well as the wrought iron entrance gates. Some terracotta and sandstone is also incorporated into the facade. All four corners of the building are chamfered, with small diagonal cutouts. On Mulberry Street, there are two wrought-iron fire escapes, one each in the annex and the original building.

==== Lower stories ====

On the first two stories of the facade, there is one double-height arch in each bay. The piers between each bay are wider than on the upper stories, and there is a brownstone course at the bottom of each pier, just above the granite pedestal. On the first story, most of the bays contain rectangular openings, which are divided vertically into groups of three. Some of the first-story openings contain storefront entrances instead of windows; these entrances are accessed by small stoops, which are made of pieces of vaulted sidewalk. The second story is a semicircular lunette window, which is divided vertically into three panes. A cast-iron transom bar separates the first- and second-story windows. The lunettes are surrounded by round arches with slightly projecting edges, and there is a horizontal string course made of brownstone above the second story.

The Puck Building&#x27;s main entrance is on Lafayette Street, within the fifth-northernmost bay. This entrance is shaped like a triumphal arch. At the ground story of the archway are two rectangular doorways, which are separated by a cast-iron column and flanked by smaller cast-iron piers. In front of each doorway is an ornate Art Nouveau wrought-iron arch with a set of wrought-iron gates. A transom bar runs above the doorways, and a statue of Puck stands atop the center of the transom bar. Above the transom bar is a lunette window. On either side of the entrance is a granite pedestal, above which are two stone columns and two pilasters, all in the Doric order. The columns and pilasters are all topped by capitals with wreath motifs. Above the columns is an architrave bearing the words &quot;Puck Building&quot; in all-capital letters, with a console bracket below the center and a balustrade above it.

When the building was completed, &quot;Puck&quot; magazine described the structure as having round arches along both Houston and Mulberry streets, with a recessed wrought-iron entrance at the corner of these streets. The entrance at the northeast corner of the building, at Houston and Mulberry streets, included a pair of doorways until 1899. This entrance has been replaced with a double-height brick column with a brownstone sphere. Above it is one of the Puck statues. which holds a mirror, pen, and book. The statue also included the inscription &quot;What fools these mortals be&quot;, the phrase printed on &quot;Puck&quot; magazine covers; this inscription had been worn away by the 1950s. When the building&#x27;s entrance was located at this corner, the column stood in front of the entrance.

==== Upper stories ====

On the third to seventh stories, the piers are narrower than on the lower stories. The third and fourth stories comprise a second tier of arcades. Within each bay, the third and fourth stories are composed of two double-height arches, each of which is half the width of the ground-level arches. The windows between the third and fourth stories are separated by patterned spandrel panels. Within each arched opening, there is a pair of sash windows on either story. Each pair of arches is separated vertically by a narrow brickwork pier with patterned capitals. In addition, there are corbels and brownstone sills running horizontally above the fourth story.

The fifth through seventh stories of each bay comprise a third arcade. On these stories, each bay has three triple-height arches, each measuring one-third of the width of the ground-level arches. Within each arched opening, there is a single sash window on each of the fifth through seventh stories. As with the third-and-fourth-story windows, each arch is divided by narrow brickwork piers with patterned capitals. At the sixth story of the building&#x27;s northeast corner, the chamfer has a massive console bracket, which originally served as the base of a flagpole. A patterned brick course, corbels, a brownstone sill, and a cornice run horizontally above the seventh story of the original building.

The annex rises another two stories; the eighth and ninth stories of the annex form a separate arcade. On these stories, each bay contains three double-height arches, which are the same width as the arches on the fifth through seventh stories. A cornice runs horizontally above the ninth floor, and each of the piers rises slightly above the level of the cornice. Both the original building and the annex were originally topped by a parapet. The section of the parapet above the original building was removed by the late 20th century but was restored in the 2010s.

=== Interior ===
The ceilings on the first floor are high, shrinking to on the upper stories. The interior&#x27;s architectural features included a cast-iron elevator. cast-iron staircases, wooden wainscoting, and open plan spaces with cast-iron columns. The columns were decorated with motifs such as rosettes, fluting, bosses, and bands. The original building to the north has a wood-beam and cast iron superstructure, while the southern annex has a brick-vault and cast iron superstructure. The brick vaults were strong enough to accommodate the weight of the building&#x27;s printing presses.

The ground (first) floor was originally used by the J. Ottman firm, and it also included a stair leading to the &quot;Puck&quot; company offices on the upper stories. On the upper floors was a reception area, a library, an office, a workshop and reception room, and a set of artists&#x27; ateliers. There was also a photographer&#x27;s darkroom on the fifth floor. In addition, artists&#x27; sketches were reproduced in color in a transfer room on the sixth floor. The building had 24 or 30 printing presses as well. After the original building was finished, &quot;King&#x27;s Handbook of New York City&quot; characterized the building as being among the largest printing-plant structures in the world. A &quot;Puck&quot; magazine supplement described the structure as being the largest printing plant near the Astor Library.

Most of the interior, including the open plan offices, remained intact in the late 20th century. A lobby for commercial tenants was added during the 1980s renovation. On average, each of the modern-day building&#x27;s floors covers about or . The building contains both office and retail space as well as ballrooms for large events on the ground and ninth floors. The Skylight Ballroom can accommodate 250 guests, while the Grand Ballroom can fit up to 1,000. Large masonry walls, measuring thick, split the interiors into thirds.

==== Penthouse apartments ====
At the top of the building are six penthouse apartments collectively known as the Puck Penthouses; they were designed by Jose Ramirez and Sherida E. Paulsen. The apartments are accessed through their own entrance and are served by a concierge. The penthouse lobby has an imported European cast-iron fireplace mantel, and the private elevator has a depiction of Puck. Each of the apartments is designated with a Roman numeral apartment number. The penthouses range from . Each penthouse has a separate layout; three of the penthouses have outdoor terraces, and two units occupy two levels. The largest unit is Penthouse I, which spans and includes five bedrooms, seven bathrooms, and of terraces.

The Puck Penthouses retain the spaces&#x27; original large windows, cast-iron columns, and vaulted brick ceilings. The units were fully furnished when they were built. The apartments have custom stoves, window frames, door hinges, and other appliances, and the bathrooms are clad in travertine. In addition, the doors are made of nickel and glass, materials that were selected specifically to give the penthouses an industrial ambiance. The builders hardware is made of materials such as marble and nickel. There are also electronic devices, such as hidden televisions in the bathroom mirrors. One of the penthouses is within a dormer structure, which has a steel frame and is structurally connected with the frames of the original structure and annex.

== History ==

=== Puck ownership ===
The building was the longtime home of &quot;Puck&quot; magazine, a humor cartoon. Joseph Keppler and Adolph Schwarzmann had founded &quot;Puck&quot; as a German-language publication in 1876 and started publishing in English in 1877. &quot;Puck&quot; magazine was originally situated near the Manhattan end of the Brooklyn Bridge. &quot;Puck&quot; and the J. Ottmann Lithographing Company, which printed out &quot;Puck&quot; cartoons, were situated on Warren Street in Manhattan&#x27;s Civic Center by 1880. The magazine&#x27;s circulation had grown to 80,000 by then, and it needed a larger building.

==== Development and opening ====
In February 1885, Keppler, Schwarzmann, and J. Ottmann agreed to acquire the Institution of Mercy at the southwest corner of Mulberry Street and Houston Street. The sale was finalized the next month; the three men paid $140,000 () for the site. The men hired Albert Wagner to design a seven-story building, with two basements, on a site measuring along Houston Street and along Mulberry Street. As planned, the ground floor would contain stores, the second and third stories would be used as offices, and the upper stories would be used as a printing plant. Demolition was underway by mid-1885. Keppler, Schwarzmann, and J. Ottmann borrowed $130,000 () from the Franklin Savings Bank. The George A. Fuller Company was the main construction contractor.

The Puck Building was completed in 1886. The original building was much wider along its northern end, at Houston Street, than along its southern end. At the time, it had of space. Originally, Ottmann&#x27;s lithograph firm was located on the ground floor, while the &quot;Puck&quot; offices upstairs were accessed by a separate lobby. Shortly after the building was finished, in June 1887, a fire caused up to $30,000 in damage to the upper floors (). There was also water damage to &quot;Puck&quot; magazine&#x27;s editorial rooms when firefighters tried to put out the blaze. The building caught fire again in early 1888, although the blaze was extinguished before a large amount of flammable material in the basement could catch fire. By the late 19th century, &quot;Puck&quot; employed 400 people at the building.

==== Expansion ====
The Board of Rapid Transit Commissioners, which was appointed in 1889 to plan a New York City Subway line, announced a tentative route for the subway&#x27;s first line in June 1890. Part of the Puck Building would need to be demolished because the line would be built underneath a new street running between Elm Street and Lafayette Place, and the building stood in the line&#x27;s way. The building would have to be reconfigured so that it had a facade along the new street. That August, Keppler, Schwarzmann, and Ottmann acquired the site at 281 Mulberry Street, directly south of the Puck Building. At the time, the irregularly-shaped site on Mulberry Street contained a three-story tenement, which Keppler and his partners planned to demolish and replace with an annex to the Puck Building. Due to uncertainties over the subway line&#x27;s construction, the annex&#x27;s construction was delayed.

B. B. Schneider sold Keppler and Schwarzmann the site on the northwest corner of Mulberry and Jersey streets in March 1892. This gave &quot;Puck&quot; executives full control of the western side of Mulberry Street between Houston and Jersey streets. The same month, Thomas Weatherby sold four houses on the north side of Jersey Street, immediately west of Schneider&#x27;s plot, to Keppler and Schwarzmann. Wagner was rehired to design the annex, which was to rise nine stories. W. Arnott was hired as the stonemason for the annex, which was planned to cost $365,000 or $400,000. Work on the annex began sometime in 1892; during the annex&#x27;s construction, some workers went on strike. In January 1893, the city government agreed to widen and extend Elm Street northward, which would require demolishing about one-third of the existing building; several property owners, including Keppler, expressed objections to the street&#x27;s extension. That year, Keppler, Schwarzmann, and Ottmann borrowed $300,000 for the annex from the Brooklyn Savings Bank (). The annex was ultimately completed in 1893. 

==== Partial demolition and early 20th century ====
Meanwhile, there were still plans to extend Elm Street north through Marion Street and Lafayette Place. In 1893, the city&#x27;s Board of Street Opening and Improvement submitted plans for the project to the New York City Board of Aldermen for approval. Though the building&#x27;s owners were still opposed to the street&#x27;s extension as late as December 1894, they had come to support the proposal by the following year. To make way for the section of Elm Street between Houston and Jersey streets, the city government decided to raze the building&#x27;s westernmost section in 1897. A city commission was appointed to determine how much each property owner should be compensated. They determined that the owners of the Puck Building would receive $464,000 in compensation ().

In September 1897, the Puck Publishing Corporation filed plans for $275,000 worth of alterations to the Puck Building (). Wagner was again hired as the architect for these modifications, and Hanlon Brothers were hired to demolish part of the building. P. &amp; J. Schaeffler received the masonry contract; Grissler &amp; Son was hired as the carpenter; and Baker, Smith &amp; Co. was hired to reconfigure the building&#x27;s steam-heating system. After Wagner died in 1898, Herman Wagner and Richard Jahn took over responsibility for the design. The northern part of the facade, originally five bays wide, was truncated to three bays. Heavy braces measuring long were used to temporarily shore up the northern and eastern elevations, and part of the remaining structure&#x27;s facade on Houston Street was also demolished and rebuilt. A new main entrance was built to the west on Elm Street (later Lafayette Street). replacing the original entrance at Houston and Mulberry streets, and Henry Baerer designed a Puck statue above the new Elm Street entrance. Materials salvaged from the building were reportedly reused in a four-story building at 163 Crosby Street.

The modifications to the Puck Building were completed in 1899, though Lafayette Street was not completed until 1905. After Keppler and Schwarzmann died in 1894 and 1904, respectively, their estates took over the respective stakes in the company (including the Puck Building). A fire in November 1905 caused $50,000 in damage (). The fire had started after a can of turpentine caught fire inside a finishing room where workers were producing Christmas cards. In 1912, six people were severely injured after one of the building&#x27;s elevators fell seven stories. The Manhattan Ladies&#x27; Hat Company leased some space in the building in 1912, followed by Teitelbaum &amp; De Marinis the following year. The Puck Building remained &quot;Puck&quot; magazine&#x27;s headquarters until 1917, when Hearst Communications took over the magazine. &quot;Puck&quot; was discontinued in September of the following year.

=== Mid-20th century ===

Though &quot;Puck&quot; magazine had been discontinued, the building remained suitable for firms in the printing industry, as its floor plates had been built to accommodate heavy printing presses. The building thus housed numerous independent printing firms and related printing services. Among the building&#x27;s tenants were the Keller Printing Company in one of the building&#x27;s lofts, the Paulus-Ullmann Printing Corporation on the fifth floor, and the Paulus &amp; Howell Press on the eighth floor. All of the usable space had been rented by the end of 1917, when Acme Steel Goods Company took the seventh floor. Other tenants in the late 1910s included the American Paper Mills, clothing manufacturers Zeeman &amp; Grossman, Raymond Engineering Corporation, and a store operated by Olney &amp; Warrin.

A ladies&#x27; hat manufacturers&#x27; association moved into the building in the 1920s, and Comfort &amp; Company, Inc., leased a large part of the building in 1935. The building&#x27;s other tenants in the mid-20th century included the bookbinder J. C. Valentine Company (which moved out in 1931 after four decades there); the printing company Lehmaier Press; the Parker-Wilson Printing Company; the printing company Costa &amp; Aliani; and the Pioneer Scientific Corporation. An office stationery company, S. Novick &amp; Son, occupied the second floor; its salesmen included former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Alger Hiss. In 1937, the Puck statue above the main entrance was cleaned.

In 1947, the Puck Building was sold to a client of David Rapaport; this was the first time the building had changed ownership in half a century. By then, the building was cited as having of space, and it was valued at $490,000 (). Marlow Handbags moved its factory to the Puck Building in the following year. By the 1950s and 1960s, the building also housed such tenants as the Empire Bookbinding Company, Prospect Press, Sample Service Corporation, and the garment-industry-ticket producer Keller Ticket Company. After Coney Island&#x27;s Steeplechase Park was closed in 1965, part of the amusement park&#x27;s fence was moved to the Puck Building, where it was rebuilt.

=== Serra and Gee ownership ===
Paul Serra&#x27;s family bought the Puck Building in 1978; at the time, the building was fully occupied. Serra and his partner Peter Gee, who ran a company called Peter, Paul and Puck, began making plans to renovate the building. The two largest tenants moved out of the building in 1980, and all but one of the other tenants moved out during the subsequent months. The Serra family bought out the last tenant&#x27;s lease and proposed converting the building into a commercial condominium. Initially, there were plans to add residential space, but this was canceled due to high costs, as the owners had to pay the displaced commercial tenants $9 per square foot. Additionally, Gee said &quot;there are too many problems involved with the city and dealing with people&#x27;s personal lives&quot; when it came to residential tenancies.

Serra and Gee converted the building to office and gallery space for graphic-arts firms. Workers regilded the Puck statues, renovated the elevator cabs, added interior wainscoting, and installed new wiring and HVAC systems; in addition, they preserved a much of the original interiors as they could. During the building&#x27;s renovation, in 1982, the author and artist Theresa Hak Kyung Cha was raped and killed in the building by a security guard named Joey Sanza. The renovation ultimately cost $14 million and mostly involved cosmetic changes. The Puck Building&#x27;s renovation, along with the construction of other residential buildings nearby, helped attract retailers to Lafayette Street, which had been a frequent hangout for drug dealers. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) designated it as a city landmark in April 1983, and the structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places the same year. 

The Puck Building reopened in April 1983. The reopening was celebrated with a temporary exhibit on the history of &quot;Puck&quot; magazine, which included artifacts from the building that were discovered during its renovation. Initially, the first two stories contained galleries, the midsection had offices, and the top stories had schools. One-third of the entire floor area was reserved for a design school operated by Gee, while the two men planned to sell the remaining space to designers, artists, and other tenants who wanted more than . The smallest condo spanned , and the units were listed for sale at an average price of . To attract tenants, Serra and Gee offered to split up existing condo units and install new floors, and they gave commercial tenants their own lobby. The structure also hosted events such as dinner parties and balls. Three years after the renovation, none of the condos had been sold, prompting Serra and Gee to sell the Puck Building.

=== Skydell and Kushner ownership ===

==== 1980s to 2000s ====

In 1986, a syndicate led by Harry Skydell paid $19 million for the building. Skydell&#x27;s partners in the syndicate included George Gellert, Charles Kushner, and Joel Seiden, and Skydell&#x27;s firm Hudson Park Management took over the building&#x27;s operation. Skydell and his partners spent another $9 million on the building, which included new elevators and mechanical systems. Sonnenblick-Goldman Corporation,borrowed $26.3 million to pay for the building&#x27;s renovation and purchase.

After the second renovation, the Puck Building was nearly fully occupied. The building was the original home of &quot;Spy Magazine&quot;, whose founders, Graydon Carter and Kurt Andersen, had specifically wanted to establish a magazine in the former &quot;Puck&quot; headquarters. The Pratt Institute opened its Manhattan Center campus on the building&#x27;s second floor in 1986, relocating several of its graphics and illustration departments there. In addition, the New York City government rented four floors, three of which were occupied by the Department of Environmental Protection and Department of Transportation; the city&#x27;s Civilian Complaint Review Board also had offices in the Puck Building, The &quot;New York Press&quot; magazine moved into the building as well. The Puck Building&#x27;s ballroom became a popular venue for fashion shows, in part due to the ballroom&#x27;s relatively low rental rates and plain architectural design. Other events hosted in the building during the late 20th and early 21st centuries included the National Black Fine Art Show and the Outsider Art Fair.

Skydell owed $2.2 million on the Puck Building and another structure by the early 1990s. Because of the ownership syndicate&#x27;s financial troubles, Kushner&#x27;s firm Kushner Companies had to take over the Puck Building. Kushner Companies thus became the sole owner of the structure. Additional tenants moved into the building during the decade. The city government stopped leasing space in the building in 1992, and Pratt expanded into some of the city government&#x27;s former space on the fourth floor. Beyer Blinder Belle designed a further renovation of the building in the mid-1990s. The Bell Technology Group leased in 1996, at which point the building&#x27;s space was fully leased. By 1998, Kushner Companies contemplated converting the ballroom spaces on the lower stories into retail space, as the Puck Building did not have any stores at the time. The city government rezoned the building&#x27;s land lot the same year, changing it from a manufacturing zone to a mixed commercial and residential zone. The structure was valued at $80 million by 2000.

Pratt moved out of the Puck Building in 2001, and New York University leased at the building two years later, becoming the structure&#x27;s largest tenant. NYU relocated its Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and sociology department into the building; at the time, the other tenants included Swanke Hayden Connell Architects and the catering firm New York Caterers. NYU hired Suben/Doughtery to install raised floors, consolidate some offices, and add a staircase to its space. The Puck Building was again renovated in the mid-2000s, when workers replaced the windows and added some lighting. The building was fully occupied at the time. In addition, the building&#x27;s owner sought to lease out the structure&#x27;s event space to a food emporium.

==== New retail space and penthouses ====

The outdoor-gear store REI leased in the building in 2010, with plans to open a three-story store there. Kushner Companies refinanced the building with a $80 million mortgage the same year. Part of the ground floor was cut away to make way for a staircase, and some of the original lower-story finishes were restored. Some materials such as wood ceilings, floor joists, and wainscoting were removed and reinstalled elsewhere within the storefront space, while equipment like flywheels and printing tablets was preserved. The storefront renovation was designed by the architecture firm of Callison and included an area that showcased the history of the Puck Building. The REI store opened in early December 2011, becoming the building&#x27;s first retail tenant in over a century.

Meanwhile, the LPC issued a permit for the facade&#x27;s renovation to Kushner Companies in May 2011. Kushner Companies&#x27; chief executive Jared Kushner announced plans that August to add penthouse apartments atop the building and hired PKSB Architects to design the residences. At the time, there was high demand for luxury residences in SoHo, and the Puck Building was among the neighborhood&#x27;s most prominent structures. The original plans for Kushner&#x27;s penthouses called for three apartments each on the eighth and ninth floors, as well as a single duplex apartment within a new dormer structure on the roof. The LPC rejected the initial designs in September 2011. Kushner submitted revised plans for two glass penthouse dormers in October, but the LPC also rejected these designs, saying the dormers were too large. The agency declined to accept a further modification that November for a similar reason. The LPC conditionally approved a downsized dormer in December 2011 and formally approved the renovation later that month. Ultimately, Kushner Companies met with the LPC five or six times. In the final plan, the dormer was downsized by and shortened by . In addition, the building&#x27;s original parapet would be restored, preventing pedestrians from seeing the penthouse dormer from street level.

Jared Kushner was involved with the design of the building&#x27;s new apartments, to the extent that he mapped out their layouts and selected the materials with which they were decorated. His wife Ivanka Trump selected the materials for the apartments&#x27; bathrooms and closets. Kushner Companies renovated the remaining space in the building as well. Kushner began marketing the condos in September 2013, asking $21 million to $60 million. At the time, Kushner anticipated that the residences would attract &quot;connoisseurs, collectors, and those with a youthful exuberance&quot;. Office and commercial tenants continued to occupy the intermediate stories. In the 2010s, these tenants included NYU&#x27;s Wagner Graduate School; a Warby Parker showroom; the Kushner family&#x27;s firm Thrive Capital, along with numerous startups funded by Thrive Capital; and several media- and internet-related firms.

==== Mid-2010s to present ====
Before sales had formally launched, penthouse IV was sold in December 2013 for about $28 million; the sale was finalized the following year. The first completed penthouse was placed for sale in January 2014, and the remaining penthouses were finished that March. Kushner placed two more penthouses on sale for $57 million the same year. The Chefs Club restaurant opened within the building&#x27;s first floor in late 2014. The next penthouse was not sold until early 2016, and the fourth penthouse was placed for sale that March. Kushner Companies replaced the penthouses&#x27; original brokerage, Sotheby&#x27;s International Realty, with the Corcoran Group the same year. With sales of the penthouse condos lagging, Kushner Companies decided to rent out three of the apartments in 2017. Kushner and Trump had originally wanted to move into one of the apartments, although they still had not done so by 2017.

Kushner&#x27;s brother Joshua and Joshua&#x27;s wife Karlie Kloss bought one of the building&#x27;s penthouse in 2019 before reselling it; the couple purchased the last remaining penthouse two years later, which they also resold. The Chefs Club restaurant closed during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, and the Major Food Club took over the space, opening the Torrisi restaurant there in 2022. After NYU relocated part of its Wagner Center out of the building in 2023, about of its space was leased to the hedge fund Quadrature. In addition, OpenAI rented , nearly half of the building&#x27;s space, in 2024. At the time, the building&#x27;s other office tenants included Thrive Capital, Plaid Inc., and Cadre.

== Impact ==
The 1893 &quot;King&#x27;s Handbook of New York City&quot; described the Puck Building as &quot;a fitting monument&quot; to &quot;Puck&quot; magazine and the J. Ottmann Lithographing Company, particularly praising the facade as giving an impression of &quot;strength combined with lightness and graceful simplicity&quot;. Paul Goldberger wrote for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1978 that the Puck Building was a &quot;fine Romanesque commercial building&quot; with &quot;amusing&quot; Puck statues, and another writer for the same newspaper said in 1983 that the building &quot;seems to fit right in with the cast-iron structures&quot; around it. Following the building&#x27;s 1983 renovation, a &quot;New York Daily News&quot; writer referred to the Puck statues as &quot;the most outstanding feature of the building&quot;. In his 1994 book &quot;New York, a Guide to the Metropolis&quot;, Gerard Wolfe wrote that the Puck Building was &quot;a fine example of the industrial Romanesque Revival style&quot; of the late 19th century; similarly, Eric Nash wrote in his 1995 book &quot;New York&#x27;s 50 Best Secret Architectural Treasures&quot; that the Puck Building was a &quot;premier example of the Rundbogenstil&quot;.

Before the Puck Building was preserved as an official city landmark, it was depicted in the Municipal Art Society&#x27;s 1982 exhibit &quot;Landmarks That Aren&#x27;t&quot;. After Wagner designed the Puck Building, he reused its design details for a structure at 140 Franklin Street in Tribeca. The Puck Building has been shown in various works of popular culture, For example, an exterior shot of the Puck Building is seen in the American television sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, and it is also used as a setting in the 1989 film &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot;. The band The National recorded parts of their 2003 album &quot;Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers&quot; in an empty penthouse in the building; two of its members, Matt Berninger and Scott Devendorf, worked there at the time. The building is also depicted in a mural in the New York Public Library Main Branch&#x27;s Periodical Room.

<text>A JAR (&quot;Java archive&quot;) file is a package file format typically used to aggregate many Java class files and associated metadata and resources (text, images, etc.) into one file for distribution.

JAR files are archive files that include a Java-specific manifest file. They are built on the ZIP format and typically have a codice_1 file extension.

==Design==
A JAR file allows Java runtimes to efficiently deploy an entire application, including its classes and their associated resources, in a single request. JAR file elements may be compressed, shortening download times.

A JAR file may contain a manifest file, that is located at codice_2. The entries in the manifest file describe how to use the JAR file. For instance, a Classpath entry can be used to specify other JAR files to load with the JAR.

==Extraction==
The contents of a file may be extracted using any archive extraction software that supports the ZIP format, or the 
codice_3 command line utility provided by the Java Development Kit.

==Security==
Developers can attributed
 sign JAR files. In that case, the signature information becomes part of the embedded manifest file. The JAR itself is not signed, but instead every file inside the archive is listed along with its checksum; it is these checksums that are signed. Multiple entities may sign the JAR file, changing the JAR file itself with each signing, although the signed files themselves remain valid. When the Java runtime loads signed JAR files, it can validate the signatures and refuse to load classes that do not match the signature. It can also support &#x27;sealed&#x27; packages, in which the Classloader will only permit Java classes to be loaded into the same package if they are all signed by the same entities. This prevents malicious code from being inserted into an existing package, and so gaining access to package-scoped classes and data.

The content of JAR files may be obfuscated to make reverse engineering more difficult.

==Executable JAR files==
An executable Java program can be packaged in a JAR file, along with any libraries the program uses. Executable JAR files have the manifest specifying the entry point class with codice_4 and an explicit Class-Path (and the -cp argument is ignored). Some operating systems can run these directly when clicked. The typical invocation is codice_5 from a command line.

Native launchers can be created on most platforms. For instance, Microsoft Windows users who prefer having Windows EXE files can use tools such as JSmooth, Launch4J, WinRun4J or Nullsoft Scriptable Install System to wrap single JAR files into executables.

==Manifest==
A manifest file is a metadata file contained within a JAR. It defines extension and package-related data. It contains name–value pairs organized in sections. If a JAR file is intended to be used as an executable file, the manifest file specifies the main class of the application. The manifest file is named codice_6. The manifest directory has to be the first entry of the compressed archive.

===Specifications===
The manifest appears at the canonical location codice_2. There can be only one manifest file in an archive and it must be at that location.

The content of the manifest file in a JAR file created with version 1.0 of the Java Development Kit is the following.

 Manifest-Version: 1.0

The name is separated from its value by a colon. The default manifest shows that it conforms to version 1.0 of the manifest specification.

The manifest can contain information about the other files that are packaged in the archive. Manifest contents depend on the intended use for the JAR file. The default manifest file makes no assumptions about what information it should record about other files, so its single line contains data only about itself. It should be encoded in UTF-8.

====Special-Purpose Manifest Headers====
JAR files created only for the purpose of archiving do not use the codice_6 file.

Most uses of JAR files go beyond simple archiving and compression and require special information in the manifest file.

===Features===
The manifest allows developers to define several useful features for their jars. Properties are specified in key-value pairs.

====Applications ====
If an application is contained in a JAR file, the Java Virtual Machine needs to know the application&#x27;s entry point. An entry point is any class with a codice_9 method. This information is provided in the manifest Main-Class header, which has the general form:

 Main-Class: com.example.MyClassName

In this example codice_10 executes at application launch.

====Package Sealing====
Optionally, a package within a JAR file can be sealed, which means that all classes defined in that package are archived in the same JAR file. A package might be sealed to ensure version consistency among the classes in the software or as a security measure.

To seal a package, a Name entry needs to appear, followed by a Sealed header, such as:

Name: myCompany/myPackage/
Sealed: true

The Name header&#x27;s value is the package&#x27;s relative pathname. Note that it ends with a &#x27;/&#x27; to distinguish it from a filename. Any headers following a Name header, without any intervening blank lines, apply to the file or package specified in the Name header. In the above example, because the codice_11 header occurs after the codice_12 header with no intervening blank lines, the codice_11 header applies (only) to the package codice_14.

The feature of sealed packages is outmoded by the Java Platform Module System introduced in Java 9, in which modules cannot split packages.

====Package Versioning====
Several manifest headers hold versioning information. One set of headers can be assigned to each package. The versioning headers appear directly beneath the Name header for the package. This example shows all the versioning headers:

Name: java/util/
Specification-Title: &quot;Java Utility Classes&quot;
Specification-Version: &quot;1.2&quot;
Specification-Vendor: &quot;Sun Microsystems, Inc.&quot;.
Implementation-Title: &quot;java.util&quot;
Implementation-Version: &quot;build57&quot;
Implementation-Vendor: &quot;Sun Microsystems, Inc.&quot;
====Multi-Release====
A jar can be optionally marked as a multi-release jar. Using the multi-release feature allows library developers to load different code depending on the version of the Java runtime. This in turn allows developers to leverage new features without sacrificing compatibility.

A multi-release jar is enabled using the following declaration in the manifest:

Multi-Release: true
====Dependencies====
The codice_6 file can be used to specify all the classes that must be loaded for an application to be able to run.

Note that Class-Path entries are delimited with spaces, not with the system path delimiter:

Class-Path: . pkg1.jar path/to/pkg2.jar
==Apache Ant Zip/JAR support==
The Apache Ant build tool has its own package to read and write Zip and JAR archives, including support for Unix filesystem extensions. The org.apache.tools.zip package is released under the Apache Software Foundation license and is designed to be usable outside Ant.

==Related formats==
Several related file formats build on the JAR format:
* WAR (Web application archive) files, also Java archives, store XML files, Java classes, JavaServer Pages and other objects for Web Applications.
* RAR (resource adapter archive) files (not to be confused with the RAR file format), also Java archives, store XML files, Java classes and other objects for J2EE Connector Architecture (JCA) applications.
* EAR (enterprise archive) files provide composite Java archives that combine XML files, Java classes and other objects including JAR, WAR and RAR Java archive files for Enterprise Applications.
* SAR (service archive) is similar to EAR. It provides a codice_16 file and accompanying JAR files.
* APK (Android application package), a variant of the Java archive format, is used for Android applications.
* AAR (Android archive) is used for distribution of Android libraries, typically via Maven.
* PAR (plan archive) – supported by Eclipse Virgo OSGi application server, allows the deployment of multi-bundle OSGi applications as a single archive and provides isolation from other PAR-based applications deployed in the same server.
* KAR (Karaf archive) – supported by Apache Karaf OSGi application server, allows the deployment of multi-bundle, multi-feature OSGi applications.

<doc id="265611" wikidata="Q1143344" url="?curid=265611" title="Global variable">
<text>In computer programming, a global variable is a variable with global scope, meaning that it is visible (hence accessible) throughout the program, unless shadowed. The set of all global variables is known as the &quot;global environment&quot; or &quot;global state.&quot; In compiled languages, global variables are generally static variables, whose extent (lifetime) is the entire runtime of the program, though in interpreted languages (including command-line interpreters), global variables are generally dynamically allocated when declared, since they are not known ahead of time.

In some languages, all variables are global, or global by default, while in most modern languages variables have limited scope, generally lexical scope, though global variables are often available by declaring a variable at the top level of the program. In other languages, however, global variables do not exist; these are generally modular programming languages that enforce a module structure, or class-based object-oriented programming languages that enforce a class structure.

==Use==
Interaction mechanisms with global variables are called global environment (see also global state) mechanisms. The global environment paradigm is contrasted with the local environment paradigm, where all variables are local with no shared memory (and therefore all interactions can be reconducted to message passing).

Global variables are used extensively to pass information between sections of code that do not share a caller/callee relation like concurrent threads and signal handlers. Languages (including C) where each file defines an implicit namespace eliminate most of the problems seen with languages with a global namespace though some problems may persist without proper encapsulation. Without proper locking (such as with a mutex), code using global variables will not be thread-safe except for read only values in protected memory.

==Environment variables==
Environment variables are a facility provided by some operating systems. Within the OS&#x27;s shell (ksh in Unix, bash in Linux, COMMAND.COM in DOS and CMD.EXE in Windows) they are a kind of variable: for instance, in unix and related systems an ordinary variable becomes an environment variable when the codice_1 keyword is used. Program code other than shells has to access them by API calls, such as
codice_2 and codice_3.

They are local to the process in which they were set. That means if we open two terminal windows (Two different processes running shell) and change value of environment variable in one window, that change will not be seen by other window.

When a child process is created, it inherits all the environment variables and their values from the parent process. Usually, when a program calls another program, it first creates a child process by forking, then the child adjusts the environment as needed and lastly the child replaces itself with the program to be called. Child processes therefore cannot use environment variables to communicate with their peers, avoiding the action at a distance problem.

==Global-only and global-by-default==

A number of non-structured languages, such as (early versions of) BASIC, COBOL and Fortran I (1956) only provide global variables. Fortran II (1958) introduced subroutines with local variables, and the COMMON keyword for accessing global variables. Usage of COMMON in FORTRAN continued in FORTRAN 77, and influenced later languages such as PL/SQL. Named COMMON groups for globals behave somewhat like structured namespaces. Variables are also global by default in Forth, Lua, Perl, and most shells.

==By language==

===C and C++===

The C language does not have a codice_4 keyword. However, variables declared outside a function have &quot;file scope,&quot; meaning they are visible within the file. Variables declared with file scope are visible between their declaration and the end of the compilation unit (codice_5 file) (unless shadowed by a like-named object in a nearer scope, such as a local variable); and they implicitly have external linkage and are thus visible to not only the codice_5 file or compilation unit containing their declarations but also to every other compilation unit that is linked to form the complete program. External linkage, however, is not sufficient for such a variable&#x27;s use in other files: for a compilation unit to correctly access such a global variable, it will need to know its type. This is accomplished by declaring the variable in each file using the codice_7 keyword. (It will be &quot;declared&quot; in each file but may be &quot;defined&quot; in only one.) Such codice_7 declarations are often placed in a shared header file, since it is common practice for all codice_5 files in a project to include at least one codice_10 file: the standard header file codice_11 is an example, making the codice_12 variable accessible to all modules in a project. Where this global access mechanism is judged problematic, it can be disabled using the codice_13 keyword which restricts a variable to file scope, and will cause attempts to import it with codice_7 to raise a compilation (or linking) error.

An example of a &quot;global&quot; variable in C:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

// This is the file-scope variable (with internal linkage), visible only in
// this compilation unit.
static int shared = 3;

// This one has external linkage (not limited to this compilation unit).
extern int over_shared;

// Also internal linkage.
int over_shared_too = 2;

static void ChangeShared() {
 // Reference to the file-scope variable in a function.
 shared = 5;

static void LocalShadow() {
 // Local variable that will hide the global of the same name.
 int shared;

 // This will affect only the local variable and will have no effect on the
 // file-scope variable of the same name.
 shared = 1000;

static void ParamShadow(int shared) {
 // This will affect only the parameter and will have no effect on the file-
 // scope variable of the same name.
 shared = -shared;

int main() {
 // Reference to the file-scope variable.

 printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, shared);

 ChangeShared();

 printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, shared);

 LocalShadow();

 printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, shared);

 ParamShadow(1);

 printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, shared);

 return 0;

As the variable is an external one, there is no need to pass it as a parameter to use it in a function besides main. It belongs to every function in the module.

The output will be:
 3
 5
 5
 5

=== Java ===
Some languages, like Java, don&#x27;t have global variables. In Java, all variables that are not local variables are fields of a class. Hence all variables are in the scope of either a class or a method. In Java, static fields (also known as class variables) exist independently of any instances of the class and one copy is shared among all instances; hence public static fields are used for many of the same purposes as global variables in other languages because of their similar &quot;sharing&quot; behavior:
public class Global {
 public static int a;


=== PHP ===
PHP has a codice_4 keyword and a number of unusual ways of using global variables.
Variables declared outside functions have file scope (which is for most purposes the widest scope). However, they are not accessible inside functions unless imported with the codice_4 keyword (i.e., the keyword &quot;accesses&quot; global variables, it does not &quot;declare&quot; them).

However, some predefined variables, known as &quot;superglobals&quot; are always accessible. 
They are all arrays. A general purpose one is the codice_17 superglobal, which contains all the variables
defined out of function scope. Changes to its elements change the original variables, and additions create new variables.
The superglobals codice_18 and codice_19 are widely used in web programming.

===Other languages===

* In Python and MATLAB a global variable can be declared anywhere with the codice_4 keyword.
* Ruby&#x27;s global variables are distinguished by a &#x27;codice_21&#x27; sigil. A number of predefined globals exist, for instance codice_22 is the current process ID.

<doc id="265615" wikidata="Q5100624" url="?curid=265615" title="Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992">
<text>Prior to the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992 (CSPA), President George H.W Bush issued Executive Order 12711 in 1990. This policy implementation was solidified by the actual Act in 1992. The Act&#x27;s main sponsors were Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for the House of Representatives and Senator Slade Gorton (R-WA) for the Senate. The Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992 was passed on May 21, 1992, by the Senate, and passed by the House of Representatives on August 10, 1992. President George H. W. Bush signed it into law on October 9, 1992. The Chinese Student Protection Act became Public Law 102-404, 106 Stat. 1969.

The Chinese Student Protection Act established permanent residence for Chinese nationals that came to the United States from June 5, 1989, to April 11, 1990. The Act was targeted towards students. The CSPA was prompted by the political repression the Chinese faced after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. Chinese students who were in the United States during the time of the protests participated in TV interviews, demonstration rallies, and were featured in newspaper articles. Chinese nationals were eligible to apply for permanent residency, even with expired passports. Over the years, the Act granted green cards to an estimated number of 54,000 Chinese nationals.

The green cards were called &quot;blood cards&quot; by the Chinese, as a “pejorative term for the green cards awarded to their countrymen who, by virtue of their presence in the U.S. at the time, were eligible for the Chinese Student Protection Act.”

==Criticisms and Pitfalls of the Act==
Although CSPA was enacted to prevent political persecution of Chinese students, the act also extended its protection to immigrants that came to America illegally, with which many Americans disagreed. Additionally, the permanent resident statute of the Act subtracted spots for Chinese immigrants to come in later years.

The executive director of Asia Watch, a large human-rights organization presence in China, spoke out against the CSPA, calling it unnecessary. According to the executive director, the only students that may have needed protection from their native country would be those that participated in televised or advertised speeches and those who wrote articles.

A document from the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization noted, “According to a cable from the U.S. Consul in Shanghai, China, over 120 returning [students]… who had come to China for various reasons were interviewed [as they prepared to go back to the U.S.]. Not one of them reported a problem.” These students that returned home for a visit during the time that this Act was in effect were still eligible to apply for green cards.

==Bills Related to the Act==

October 23, 1997&lt;br&gt;H.R. 2728, a bill to extend the provisions of the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992 to certain aliens who entered the United States without inspection. In summary, the bill wished to grant more Chinese students after the original 1992 Act status. This bill also included that the number of Chinese allowed to enter the country not be lowered due to this bill. The bill was to be cited as the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1997, and was brought before the House of Representatives. The bill was introduced through the Judiciary Committee, but no action was taken.

June 4, 2009&lt;br&gt;S. 1182, a bill to amend the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992, would “eliminate the provision requiring the reduction of annual People’s Republic of China (PRC) immigrant visas to offset status adjustments under such Act.” The bill was read twice in the Senate and referred to the Judiciary Committee but no other action was made.

2017&lt;br&gt;Bills entitled &quot;Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2017&quot; were introduced into the House (H.R. 392) and Senate (S. 281) of the 115th United States Congress. These bills would amend the CSPA “to eliminate the provision requiring the reduction of annual Chinese immigrant visas to offset status adjustments under such Act.”

==Effects on the Chinese in America==
Studies show that the Chinese benefited from the CSPA. “Among those with at least a Bachelor’s degree, workers from mainland China experienced hourly earnings gains of 18 percent during the 1990s relative to the control group. The relative gain was 21 percent among mainland Chinese women and 16 percent among mainland Chinese men. Relative employment rates rose substantially post-CSPA for mainland Chinese male and female college graduates.” (Institute for International Integration Studies, Trinity College Dublin)

==Effects on the United States Labor Market==
Despite the critiques of the CSPA, studies have shown that there was a largely positive impact in the area of beneficiaries&#x27; labor market. Theoretically, benefits for recipients of CSPA work eligibility include higher income, flexibility, the ability to work legally, and possibility for longer-term employment. “The CSPA appears to have raised the employment rate by 7 percentage points among college-graduate PRC immigrants relative to those from Hong Kong, controlling for other factors, and to have boosted relative hourly earnings growth by 17 to 24 percent.” (Institute for International Integration Studies) Women and highly educated immigrants benefited most.

<doc id="265631" wikidata="Q1258329" url="?curid=265631" title="USS Cumberland (1842)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Cumberland&quot; was a 50-gun sailing frigate of the United States Navy. She was the first ship sunk by the ironclad CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;.

&quot;Cumberland&quot; began in the pages of a Congressional Act. Congress passed in 1816 &quot;An act for the gradual increase of the Navy of the United States.&quot; The act called for the U.S. to build several ships-of-the-line and several new frigates, of which &quot;Cumberland&quot; was to be one. Money issues, however, prevented &quot;Cumberland&quot; from being finished in a timely manner. It was not until Secretary of the Navy Abel Parker Upshur came to office that the ship was finished. A war scare with Britain led Upshur to order the completion of several wooden sailing ships and for the construction of new steam powered ships.

Designed by famed American designer William Doughty, &quot;Cumberland&quot; was one a series of frigates in a class called the &quot;Raritan&quot;-class. The design borrowed heavily from older American frigate designs such as &quot;Constitution&quot; and &quot;Chesapeake&quot;. Specifically, Doughty liked the idea of giving a frigate more guns than European designs called for. As a result, he called for &quot;Cumberland&quot; and her sister ships to have a fully armed spar deck, along with guns on the gun deck. The result was a heavily armed, 50-gun warship.

==First Mediterranean cruise==
She was launched on 24 May 1842 by Boston Navy Yard. Her first commanding officer was Captain Samuel Livingston Breese, and her first service was as flagship of the Mediterranean Squadron from 1843 to 1845 where she had among her officers men like Foote (who served as executive officer) and Dahlgren (who served as a flag aide to Commodore Joseph Smith). The ship sailed to several parts of the Mediterranean including Port Mahon (homeport for U.S. Navy ships operating in the Mediterranean at this time), Genoa, Naples, Toulon, Jaffa, and Alexandria. The cruise was largely uneventful, though there was a diplomatic scuffle with the Sultan of Morocco who refused to recognize the newly appointed American ambassador. The incident possibly was the result of the Sultan being misled by the outgoing American ambassador who did not want to leave his post. Smith cleared up the misunderstanding and the new ambassador assumed his duties. The most notable event was Foote&#x27;s successful effort to ban the grog ration. He believed it was a grand success in turning sailors into harder working, upstanding men. It later became department policy in 1862 and it is still in effect to this day (with some exceptions.)

==Mexican–American War==
As the ship was being made ready for a second trip to the Mediterranean, the Secretary of the Navy ordered the vessel to Mexico to assist in a show of force off the coast of Vera Cruz. Here she was flagship of the Home Squadron between February and December 1846, serving in the Gulf of Mexico during the Mexican–American War under the command of Cmdre. David Conner and Capt. Thomas Dulay. Capt. French Forrest later took command when Dulay fell ill. Other notable officers in this cruise were future Civil War rivals Raphael Semmes and John Winslow. The ship oversaw the blockade of the eastern Mexican coast for most of the war. She participated in several aborted attacks on Mexican ports, before running aground on 28 July off the coast of Alvarado. The ship was freed and her ship&#x27;s company later participated in a raid on Tabasco. The grounding damaged her enough to force her to retire to Norfolk for repairs. Her crew, however, stayed behind and swapped ships with the crew of the sister frigate &quot;Raritan&quot;, which had been at sea for three years. The old crew participated in the Siege of Veracruz as part of the Naval battery.

&quot;Cumberland&quot; returned to Mexico just as a ceasefire was in place. Commodore Matthew C. Perry took over as flag officer from Conner. From &quot;Cumberland&quot;, Perry was instructed by the Polk Administration to assist settlers fleeing a major Mayan insurrection (known as the Caste War of Yucatán). Perry was also ordered to enforce the Monroe Doctrine and keep Spanish and English forces from interfering. With no realistic way to assist the settlers Perry partially ignored the order when Spanish warships arrived from Cuba loaded with guns, bullets, and money. Perry left the region when he read that the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo had been ratified.

==Second Mediterranean cruise==
&quot;Cumberland&quot; made her second cruise to the Mediterranean from 1849 to 1851. Notable officers on board during the second and third cruises to the Mediterranean included Louis M. Goldsborough, John H. Upshur, Silas Stringham, Andrew A. Harwood, John Worden (future commanding of officer of ), and naval surgeon Dr. Edward Squibb (co-founder of the company now known as Bristol-Myers Squibb).

&quot;Cumberland&quot;″s primary mission during these two cruises was to uphold American neutrality during a very turbulent period in European history by assisting American diplomats, merchants, and increasingly large number of American missionaries. The ship made visits to La Spezia (the U.S. Navy&#x27;s new overseas homeport after being expelled from Port Mahon), Naples, Trieste, and Brindisi. At one point police in Naples boarded the ship based on a false rumor that Italian nationalist Giuseppe Garibaldi was on board. The ship also sailed to the eastern half of the Mediterranean and visited Athens, Beirut, and Alexandria.

==Third Mediterranean cruise==
The third Mediterranean cruise departed from Boston on 8 May 1852. During the third cruise, the ship worked closely with diplomat and early environmentalist George Perkins Marsh who was serving as American ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. Marsh needed &quot;Cumberland&quot;″s help in dealing with zealous Greek priests who were harassing American missionaries, notably Rev. Jonas King. Cmdre. Stringham and Marsh met with Greek monarch King Otto and stopped the harassment. Marsh needed &quot;Cumberland&quot; a second time when the powers of Europe were about to clash in the Crimean War. Stringham invited any American on board who felt they needed protection or assistance. Abd-ul-Mejid I, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, invited Stringham and Marsh for an official visit to determine the position of the U.S. in a possible war with Russia. Both Stringham and Marsh expressed their sympathies to the Sultan but maintained American neutrality on the subject.

According to the autobiography of James Edward Watters (a crew member), during the third cruise of the USS &quot;Cumberland&quot; in the Mediterranean, while the &quot;Cumberland&quot; was at Constantinople, &quot;the Turkish garrison, in firing a salute, by mistake fired a shotted gun, the shot striking the water not a great distance from our boat. The Commodore (Stringham) said to the Captain (Goldsberry), &#x27;Put an Officer in a boat and send him ashore to ask whether they want that salute returned the way they gave.&#x27; the officer started but was met by an Officer (of the Turkish garrison) who apologized saying it was a mistake.&quot;

The third was long even by 19th century standards. Due to a lack of sailors to man a replacement ship, SecNav James C. Dobbin did not recall &quot;Cumberland&quot; until the ship had been at sea for three years. The ship returned home to the Boston (Massachusetts) Navy Yard (also known as Charlestown Navy Yard) in June, 1855.

==Conversion==

From 1855 to 1857, &quot;Cumberland&quot; was razeed at the Charlestown Navy Yard in Boston. From his office in Washington, D.C., John Lenthall, the Chief of the Bureau of Construction and Repair, directed the changes to the ship. The Navy gave the vessel a completely new battery. On the spar deck, two X-inch Dahlgren gun smoothbores were placed, one at each end of the ship. On the gun deck, twenty IX-inch Dahlgren smoothbores were placed. By razeeing the ship, &quot;Cumberland&quot; got an extension of life. The Navy made her a lighter ship and thus slightly faster. Specifically, the shipyard workers removed the spar deck guns and lowered the bulwarks, decreasing the weight of the ship and reducing the crew and supply needs.

This move was assisted by the revolution in naval weapons that provided more powerful guns (and thus needing fewer guns). While steam powered ships were entering the fleet, there was still a need for all the sail ships. As late as 1860, Secretary of the Navy Isaac Toucey suggested that all &quot;Potomac&quot;-class frigates be razeed.

==Africa/slave trade patrol==
From 1857 to 1859, she cruised on the coast of Africa as flagship of the African Squadron patrolling for the suppression of the slave trade. Like many U.S. Navy ships in Africa, &quot;Cumberland&quot; employed a number of Krooman (indigenous Africans who lived on the western coast) to serve as scouts, interpreters, and fishermen. The ship&#x27;s surgeons had to deal with a number of issues, including an outbreak of smallpox.

&quot;Cumberland&quot; boarded several dozen merchant ships. Her crew almost seized one, the schooner &quot;Cortez&quot;, after shackles and known slave trading items had been found on the deck of the schooner, a slave trading holding pen had been spotted in the distance, the ship&#x27;s papers were highly suspect, and the ship was far from any port. &quot;Cumberland&quot;″s boarding officer, however, chose not to seize the ship possibly realizing the legal difficulty of bringing slave traders to trial without overwhelming evidence. &quot;Cortez&quot; was later captured by HMS &quot;Arrow&quot; in 1858 off the coast of Cuba.

Otherwise, the ship served as the squadron&#x27;s supply vessel providing supplies to the other three ships in the squadron, the sloops-of-war &quot;Dale&quot;, &quot;Vincennes&quot;, and &quot;Marion&quot; and served as roving diplomat along the three thousand mile coast line.

==Home Squadron==
After her return from Africa, &quot;Cumberland&quot; became flagship of the Home Squadron in 1860. She made a return trip to Vera Cruz, which was in the middle of a civil war. The Navy recalled her to Hampton Roads, Virginia when domestic issues in the U.S. took a turn for the worse.

==American Civil War==
At the outbreak of the American Civil War, &quot;Cumberland&quot; was at the Gosport Navy Yard, with orders to monitor the situation in Norfolk and Portsmouth. After the attack on Fort Sumter, the ship&#x27;s company was ordered to gather up or destroy U.S. Government property. This included several crates of small arms and possibly (not yet confirmed) gold from the U.S. Customs House in Norfolk. The company was also ordered to spike all 3,000 guns at the Navy Yard within just a few hours. This latter task was impossible, given that only 100 sailors were assigned to the task. Sailors from the Yard and the barracks ship &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; boarded &quot;Cumberland&quot; as a part of the evacuation.

She was towed out of the Yard by the tug &quot;Yankee&quot;, assisted by the steam sloop &quot;Pawnee&quot;, escaping destruction when other ships there were scuttled and burned by Union forces on 20 April 1861 to prevent their capture. She sailed back to Boston for repairs. The aft 10-inch shell gun was removed and replaced with what many officers referred to as a 70-pounder rifle. This gun did not exist in the Navy&#x27;s inventory at the time. It was possibly a , Parrott rifle.
She sailed back to Hampton Roads and took up station as a blockader, serving in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron until 8 March 1862. The sloop-of-war engaged Confederate forces in several minor actions in Hampton Roads and captured many small ships in the harbor. Additionally, &quot;Cumberland&quot; was a part of the expedition that captured the forts at Cape Hatteras.

&quot;Cumberland&quot; was rammed and sunk in an engagement with the Confederate ironclad CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; (formerly ) at Newport News, Virginia on 8 March 1862. The engagement known as the first day of the Battle of Hampton Roads between the two ships is considered to be a turning point in the history of world naval affairs as it showed the advantage of steam-powered, armored ships over sail-powered wooden-hulled ships. Because of &quot;Cumberland&quot;, &quot;Virginia&quot; lost two of her guns, her ram, and suffered some internal damage. Congress later recognized that &quot;Cumberland&quot; did more damage to &quot;Virginia&quot; than the U.S. Navy&#x27;s ironclad &quot;Monitor&quot;, which did battle with &quot;Virginia&quot; the next day.

One of the men who died aboard &quot;Cumberland&quot; was Navy chaplain John L. Lenhart, a Methodist minister. He was the first Navy chaplain to lose his life in battle.

The battle with &quot;Virginia&quot; was commemorated in a poem &quot;On Board the Cumberland&quot; that was illustrated by F. O. C. Darley, and in the song Cumberland&#x27;s Crew printed in 1865 but author unknown. That song inspired a century of folk songs of the same or similar names, such as Cumberland and the Merrimac.

==Salvage==
Following the sinking of the &quot;Cumberland,&quot; the federal government almost immediately solicited work from salvage companies to secure valuable items from the shipwreck.

In his memoir, &quot;When the Yankees Came&quot;, Virginia resident George Benjamin West described some post-war work on &quot;Cumberland&quot;:

Occasional salvage of the shipwrecks continued into the early 20th century. In 1909, part of &quot;Cumberland&quot;″s anchor chain was recovered and sent to the museum of the Confederacy in Richmond (&quot;Newport News Daily Press&quot;, 12 November 1909).

In 1981, the National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA) contracted with Underwater Archaeological Joint Ventures (UAJV), a private firm based in Yorktown, Virginia. UAJV team members consulted local watermen (whose oyster dredges had picked up artifacts for years) to help locate the ships. This information and a remote sensing survey led archaeologists to two significant wrecks. The recovery of numerous artifacts confirmed that these shipwrecks were most likely &quot;Cumberland&quot; and CSS &quot;Florida&quot;. Artifacts recovered included fasteners, fittings, apothecary vessels, a ship&#x27;s bell (from &quot;Cumberland&quot;), cannon fuses and other ordnance items. The artifacts proved the NUMA/UAJV team had indeed found &quot;Cumberland&quot; and &quot;Florida&quot;. Most of the artifacts from this NUMA/UAJV excavation are on exhibit at the Hampton Roads Naval Museum in Norfolk, VA (&quot;Newport News Daily Press&quot;, 8 March 1987).

==&quot;Cumberland&quot; today==
&quot;Cumberland&quot; is currently a shipwreck under the protection of several Federal laws, including the Sunken Military Craft Act of 2005, the Abandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987, and the Territorial Clause of the U.S. Constitution (which gives the U.S. Government exclusive rights to its own property). Federal courts have upheld these laws and the U.S. Government&#x27;s exclusive rights to its own ships.

Since her sinking, the ship has been the subject of many expeditions. Some of these expeditions have been in violation of Federal law and artifacts were seized by Federal agents. Many artifacts from these expeditions (both legal and illegal) are at the Hampton Roads Naval Museum.

The wreck is facing west to east, with the bow of the vessel slightly above the floor of Hampton Roads.

<text>Invocation is the act of calling upon a deity, spirit, or supernatural force, typically through prayer, ritual, or spoken formula, to seek guidance, assistance, or presence. It is a practice found in numerous religious, spiritual, and esoteric traditions, where it serves to establish a connection between the human and the divine or metaphysical realms. Invocation can be directed toward a singular deity, multiple deities, spirits, or abstract forces, and may involve formal liturgies, spontaneous prayers, chants, or symbolic actions. Unlike evocation, which is generally understood as calling a spirit to appear outside the practitioner, invocation often implies inviting the entity to be present within or to closely align with the practitioner.

The purpose of invocation varies across cultural and religious contexts. In many traditions, it is used to request divine intervention, protection, wisdom, or blessings in personal or communal matters. Invocation may also serve to consecrate a space, mark the beginning of a sacred ritual, or facilitate a deeper spiritual experience. In mystical or esoteric practices, invocation can be a means of aligning oneself with a higher spiritual principle or archetype, fostering personal transformation or enlightenment. In some cases, invocation may result in possession, where the invoked entity is believed to temporarily inhabit or influence the practitioner.

The scope of invocation is broad, encompassing a wide range of religious, magical, and philosophical practices. In formal religious contexts, such as Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam, invocation is often integrated into prayers, hymns, and rituals. For example, Christian liturgy frequently includes invocations of the Holy Trinity or saints, while Hindu pujas invoke various deities through mantras and offerings. In ceremonial magic and theurgy, invocation is used to summon divine powers for guidance or to achieve specific spiritual outcomes. Additionally, modern spiritual movements, such as Wicca and modern Paganism, employ invocation to call upon deities, elemental forces, or spirits of nature. Beyond religious practice, invocation has also been explored in psychological frameworks; Carl Jung&#x27;s concept of active imagination involves engaging with archetypal figures from the unconscious, a process that parallels the symbolic aspects of invocation.

==Historical background==
Invocation has played a central role in religious, spiritual, and magical practices across diverse cultures and historical periods. Its origins can be traced to ancient civilizations, where invoking deities or supernatural forces was integral to both public rituals and private devotion. As a supplication or prayer, an invocation calls upon God, a god, or a goddess, either in a pre-established form or in the practitioner&#x27;s own words. An example of a pre-established text for an invocation is the Lord&#x27;s Prayer.

In ancient Mesopotamia, invocation was deeply embedded in religious ceremonies and daily life. The Sumerians, Akkadians, and Babylonians invoked their gods through hymns, prayers, and ritual offerings to secure protection, favor, and guidance. Texts such as the &quot;Enūma Eliš&quot;, the Babylonian creation myth, begin with invocations to the gods, emphasizing their foundational role in maintaining cosmic order. Many preserved texts, written in cuneiform characters on clay tablets, are addressed to Shamash, Ishtar, and other deities.

In ancient Egypt, invocation was central to both state-sponsored and personal religious practices. Pharaohs and priests invoked deities during temple rituals, often accompanied by offerings, music, and recitations from sacred texts such as the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;. These invocations were believed to maintain &quot;ma’at&quot; (cosmic balance) and ensure the favor of the gods for both the living and the dead.

In ancient Greece, invocation was a vital element in both public and private worship. The &quot;Orphic Hymns&quot;, a collection of eighty-seven ancient Greek invocations addressed to various deities, were attributed to the mythical poet Orpheus. Poets such as Homer and Hesiod famously began their epic works with invocations to the Muses, seeking divine inspiration to recount their tales. Religious ceremonies and oracles, like those at Delphi, involved invoking gods such as Apollo for prophecy and guidance. Invocation also played a role in the mystery religions, including the Eleusinian Mysteries, where initiates called upon Demeter and Persephone during secret rites aimed at securing blessings and insights into the afterlife.

In ancient Rome, the adaptation of Greek religious practices retained invocation as a key feature. Roman religious rituals, including augury and sacrifices, required the formal invocation of deities such as Jupiter, Mars, and Venus. Legal and political ceremonies also incorporated invocations, emphasizing the close relationship between religion and governance in Roman society.

In early Christianity, invocation evolved into formalized prayers and liturgies, often directed toward God, Jesus Christ, or the Holy Spirit. Early Christians also invoked saints and martyrs, believing they could intercede with God on behalf of the faithful. Invocation was particularly significant in sacraments such as the Eucharist, where prayers called for the transformation of bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ. This practice expanded during the Middle Ages with the rise of Marian devotion and the invocation of the Virgin Mary in prayers like the Hail Mary.

In Islam, one of the earliest treaties on invocations, attributed to a scholar named Khālid ibn Yazīd, has survived on a papyrus booklet dated 880-881.

Invocation has also been central in mystical and esoteric traditions. In Hermeticism and Neoplatonism, invocation was a key practice in theurgy, where practitioners sought to ascend to higher spiritual realms by invoking divine intelligences. Texts in the Hermetic corpus describe rituals where practitioners call upon cosmic forces for enlightenment and union with the divine. In medieval grimoires, invocation was used to summon angels or spirits for magical purposes, often with complex rituals and protective incantations.

==In the major religions==
In formal religious rituals, invocation often takes the form of structured prayers or liturgies. In Christianity, invocations are integral to many sacraments and liturgical ceremonies. The Mass begins with invocations calling upon the Holy Trinity, and specific prayers invoke the presence of Christ or the Holy Spirit to consecrate the bread and wine during the Eucharist. Additionally, the Litany of the Saints invokes a list of saints to intercede on behalf of the congregation. In Eastern Orthodox traditions, invocations play a similar role, with prayers directed to the &quot;Theotokos&quot; (Mother of God) and various saints during services and sacraments. In charismatic Christian traditions, invocation may manifest as spontaneous prayers or speaking in tongues, believed to be inspired by the Holy Spirit.

In Hinduism, invocation is central to puja (ritual worship), where deities are called upon through mantras, offerings, and ritual gestures. The process of &quot;avahana&quot; (inviting the deity) is a key step in many Hindu rituals, symbolizing the arrival of the divine presence into a &quot;murti&quot; (sacred image) or ritual space. Mantras like the Gayatri Mantra or invocations to deities such as Ganesha are recited to seek blessings, wisdom, and protection.

In Islam, invocation () is an essential aspect of personal and communal worship. While formal prayers (&quot;salat&quot;) follow prescribed structures, &quot;du&#x27;a&quot; allows for spontaneous, personal invocations of Allah for guidance, forgiveness, and assistance. The 99 Names of Allah are often invoked in these prayers to reflect different aspects of divine mercy and power. Additionally, invocations are made before daily activities, such as beginning meals or embarking on journeys, highlighting the integration of invocation into everyday life.

In Buddhism, invocation is commonly practiced through the chanting of mantras, prayers, and devotional recitations directed toward Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, or protective deities. Rather than appealing to a creator god, these invocations seek guidance, blessings, and the cultivation of virtues such as compassion and wisdom. In Pure Land Buddhism, practitioners invoke Amitabha Buddha through the recitation of the &quot;nianfo&quot;, aspiring for rebirth in the Pure Land. In Vajrayana traditions, invocation involves complex rituals and deity yoga, where practitioners visualize themselves as enlightened beings like Tara or Avalokiteshvara to embody their qualities and accelerate spiritual progress.

==In indigenous and shamanistic traditions==
In indigenous and shamanistic traditions, invocation is used to summon spirits, ancestors, or natural forces. Shamans often invoke spirit guides, animal totems, or elemental forces during healing rituals, trance states, or vision quests. These invocations are believed to facilitate communication with the spirit world, allowing the shaman to receive guidance, perform healings, or influence natural phenomena. In many indigenous cultures, invocation is also central to rituals that honor ancestors or seek harmony with the natural world.

==In mysticism and esotericism==
In mysticism and Western esotericism, invocation serves as a means of aligning with higher spiritual forces or accessing hidden knowledge. In Hermeticism and theurgy, practitioners invoke divine intelligences or cosmic principles to facilitate spiritual ascent or transformation. The Hermetic corpus describes rituals in which the practitioner invokes celestial powers to achieve gnosis (spiritual enlightenment) and union with the divine. In Kabbalistic traditions, practitioners may invoke the names of God or angelic beings through meditative and ritual practices to attain spiritual insights or achieve mystical states.

In ceremonial magic and grimoire traditions, invocation is often used to summon deities, angels, or spirits for specific purposes. Texts like the &quot;Key of Solomon&quot; and &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; outline complex rituals for invoking spiritual entities, often accompanied by protective symbols, incantations, and ritual tools. These practices aim to establish control over the invoked entities to gain knowledge, power, or other desired outcomes. Aleister Crowley distinguished invocation from evocation, stating:

==In psychology==
In psychology, invocation can be understood as a process of engaging with internal archetypes, symbols, or aspects of the unconscious mind. While traditional invocation involves calling upon external deities or spiritual forces, psychological interpretations often view this practice as a means of accessing and integrating inner psychological elements. This perspective is particularly prominent in analytical psychology, founded by Carl Jung.

Jung introduced the concept of active imagination, a technique where individuals deliberately engage in dialogue with figures or symbols that emerge from the unconscious. These figures often represent archetypes, such as the Shadow, Anima/Animus, or Wise Old Man, which are universal symbols found across cultures. In this process, the practitioner &quot;invokes&quot; these inner figures, not as literal beings, but as manifestations of deeper psychological truths. By interacting with these symbols, individuals can achieve greater self-awareness, confront repressed emotions, and facilitate personal growth—a process Jung called individuation.

Invocation in this context is also related to the concept of self-suggestion and affirmation, where individuals use specific language or rituals to influence their mental and emotional states. This can be seen in practices like visualization, mantra repetition, and affirmations, which aim to align the conscious mind with desired goals or emotional outcomes.

Moreover, invocation has been studied within the field of transpersonal psychology, which examines the spiritual aspects of human experience. Here, invocation is viewed as a way to transcend the ego and connect with a larger sense of self, the universe, or the divine, whether interpreted literally or symbolically.

==In modern spiritual practice==
In modern spiritual movements, invocation continues to play a significant role. In Wicca and modern Paganism, invocation is used to call upon deities, elemental forces, or spirits of nature during rituals and seasonal celebrations. The Drawing Down the Moon ritual, for example, involves invoking the Goddess to speak or act through the practitioner, fostering a direct connection with the divine. In New Age practices, invocation may involve calling upon spirit guides, ascended masters, or cosmic energies for personal growth, healing, or manifestation.

== As a form of possession ==
The ecstatic, possessory form of invocation may be compared to loa possession in the Vodou tradition where devotees are described as being &quot;ridden&quot; or &quot;mounted&quot; by the deity or spirit. In 1995 National Geographic journalist Carol Beckwith described events she had witnessed during Vodoun possessions:

Possessive invocation has also been described in certain Norse rites where Odin is invoked to &quot;ride&quot; workers of seidr (Norse shamanism), much like the god rides his eight-legged horse Sleipnir. Indeed, forms of possessive invocation appear throughout the world in most mystical or ecstatic traditions, wherever devotees seek to touch upon the essence of a deity or spirit.

<text>Interleaved Bitmap (ILBM) is an image file format conforming to the Interchange File Format (IFF) standard. The format originated on the Amiga platform, and on IBM-compatible systems, files in this format or the related PBM (Planar Bitmap) format are typically encountered in games from late 1980s and early 1990s that were either Amiga ports or had their graphical assets designed on Amiga machines.

A characteristic feature of the format is that it stores bitmaps in the form of interleaved bit planes, which gives the format its name; this reflects the way the Amiga graphics hardware natively reads graphics data from memory. Packbits, a simple form of compression is supported to make ILBM files more compact.

On the Amiga, these files are not associated with a particular file extension, though as they started being used on PC systems where extensions are systematically used, they employed a &quot;.lbm&quot; or occasionally a &quot;.pbm&quot; extension.

== File format ==
ILBM is an implementation of the IFF file format consisting of a number of consecutive chunks, whose order can, to some extent, be varied. Each chunk has a different function and has the same basic format. This means that a program does not have to read or decode every chunk in a file, only the ones it wants to deal with or the ones it can understand.

ILBM files usually contain enough information to allow them to be displayed by an image editing program, including image dimensions, palette and pixel data. Some files were designed to act as palettes for paint programs (pixel data left blank) or to be merged into another image. This makes them much more flexible, but also much more complex than other formats such as BMP.

For ILBMs the BMHD (Bit Map HeaDer) chunk and any other &#x27;vital&#x27; chunks must appear before the BODY chunk. Any chunks appearing after BODY are considered &#x27;extra&#x27; and many programs will leave them unread and unchanged.

=== BMHD: Bitmap Header ===
The BMHD chunk specifies how the image is to be displayed and is usually the first chunk inside the FORM. It not only defines the image&#x27;s height/width, but where it is drawn on the screen, how to display it in various screen resolutions and if the image is compressed. The content of this chunk is as follows:

=== BODY: Image data ===
The BODY chunk is usually the last chunk in a file, and the largest.

In ILBM files the BODY chunk stores the actual image data as interleaved bitplanes (and optional mask) by row. The bitplanes appear first from 1 to n, followed by the mask plane. If the image is uncompressed then each line will be made up of codice_1 16-bit values (i.e. one bit per pixel, rounded up to the nearest multiple of 16-bits.) If it is compressed then each line is compressed individually and is always a multiple of 16-bits long when compressed.

In PBM files, the BODY chunk is simpler as uncompressed it is just a continuous stream of bytes containing image data.

==== Compression ====
If an image is compressed, each row of data (but not each bitplane) is compressed individually, including the mask data if present. The compression is a variety of RLE Compression using flags. It can be decoded as follows:

* Loop until we have [Final length] bytes worth of data (final length calculated from image size.)
* While [Decompressed data length] &lt; [Final length]:
*# Read a byte [Value]
*# If [Value] &gt; 128, then:
*#* Read the next byte and output it (257 - [Value]) times.
*#* Move forward 2 bytes and return to step 1.
*# Else if [Value] &lt; 128, then:
*#* Read and output the next [value + 1] bytes
*#* Move forward [Value + 2] bytes and return to step 1.
*# Else [Value] = 128, exit the loop (stop decompressing)

For the compression routine, it&#x27;s best to encode a 2 byte repeat run as a replicate run except when preceded and followed by a literal run, in which case it is best to merge the three into one literal run. Always encode &gt;3 byte repeats as replicate runs.

=== CAMG: Amiga mode ===
A CAMG chunk is specifically for the Commodore Amiga computer. It stores a LONG &quot;viewport mode&quot;. This lets you specify Amiga display modes like &quot;dual playfield&quot; and &quot;hold and modify&quot;. It is, not surprisingly, rare outside of Amiga games.
If you need to convert or display files that might contain meaningful CAMG chunks, see the &#x27;Notes on working with ILBM files&#x27; below.

=== CMAP: Palette ===
The CMAP chunk contains the image&#x27;s palette and consists of 3-byte RGB values for each colour used. Each byte is between 0 and 255 inclusive. The chunk is codice_2 bytes long. The number of colours in the palette will be codice_3. This chunk is optional and a default palette will be used if it is not present. It is possible to have fewer entries than expected (e.g. 7 colours for a 4-plane &#x27;16 colour&#x27; bitmap for example.) Remember that if this has an odd number of colours, as per the IFF specification the chunk will be padded by one byte to make it an even number of bytes long, but the pad byte is not included in the chunk&#x27;s length field.

=== CRNG: Colour range ===
The colour range chunk is &#x27;nonstandard&#x27;. It is used by Electronic Arts&#x27; Deluxe Paint program to identify a contiguous range of colour registers or a &quot;shade range&quot; and colour cycling. There can be zero or more CRNG chunks in an ILBM file, but all should appear before the BODY chunk. Deluxe Paint normally writes 4 CRNG chunks in an ILBM when the user asks it to &quot;Save Picture&quot;.

=== CCRT: Colour cycling ===
Commodore&#x27;s Graphicraft program uses CCRT for &quot;Colour Cycling Range and Timing&quot;. This chunk contains a CycleInfo structure. Like CRNG it is a nonstandard chunk.

The data is similar to a CRNG chunk. A program would probably only use one of these two methods of expressing colour cycle data. You could write out both if you want to communicate this information to both DeluxePaint and Graphicraft.

=== DEST: Bitplane combining ===
The optional property DEST is a way to control how to scatter zero or more source bitplanes into a deeper destination image. Some readers may ignore DEST.

The low order depth number of bits in planePick, planeOnOff, and planeMask correspond one-to-one with destination bitplanes. Bit 0 with bitplane 0, etc. Any higher order bits should be ignored.

&quot;1&quot; bits in planePick mean &quot;put the next source bitplane into this bitplane&quot;, so the number of &quot;1&quot; bits should equal numPlanes. &quot;0&quot; bits mean &quot;put the corresponding bit from planeOnOff into this bitplane&quot;.

Bits in planeMask gate writing to the destination bitplane: &quot;1&quot; bits mean &quot;write to this bitplane&quot; while &quot;0&quot; bits mean &quot;leave this bitplane alone&quot;. The normal case (with no DEST chunk) is equivalent to codice_4.

Remember that color numbers are formed by pixels in the destination bitmap (depth planes deep) not in the source bitmap (numPlanes planes deep).

=== GRAB: Hotspot ===
The optional GRAB chunk locates a &quot;handle&quot; or &quot;hotspot&quot; of the image relative to its upper left corner, e.g., when used as a mouse cursor or a &quot;paint brush&quot;. It is optional.

=== SPRT: Z-order ===
The SPRT chunk indicates that an image is intended to be a sprite. It should thus have a mask plane or transparent colour and shouldn&#x27;t be fullscreen. How this is handled depends on the program using the image. The only data stored here is the sprite order, used by many programs to place the sprite in the foreground (a sprite of order 1 appears behind one of order 0, etc.) It is optional.

=== TINY: Thumbnail ===
The TINY chunk contains a small preview image for various graphics programs, including Deluxe Paint. It is compressed and is similar in format to the BODY chunk.

== Notes for working with ILBM ==

=== Color Maps ===
Sometimes an ILBM file contains only a colour map and no image data. Often used to store a palette of colours that can be applied to an image separately. In this case the BODY chunk should be empty and the numPlanes field in the BMHD chunk will be 0.

=== Deep Images ===
Some ILBM files contain &#x27;true-colour&#x27; information rather than indexed colours. These so-called &#x27;deep images&#x27; files have no CMAP chunk and usually have 24 or 32 bitplanes. The standard ordering for the bitplanes will put the least significant bit of the red component first:

R0 R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 R6 R7 G0 G1 G2 G3 G4 G5 G6 G7 B0 B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7

If there are 32 bit planes, the last 8 bit planes will be an alpha channel:

R0 R1 ... R7 G0 ... G7 B0 ... B6 B7 A0 A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7

An image containing no colour map and only 8 bitplanes may be a greyscale image:

I0 I1 I2 I3 I4 I5 I6 I7

=== Extra Half-Brite ===
If the ILBM file contains a CAMG chunk in which bit 7 is set (i.e. 0x80 in hexadecimal). The file expects to make use of the EHB (Extra Half-Brite) mode of the Amiga chipset. The colour map will have no more than 32 entries, but the image will have 6 bitplanes. The most significant bitplane should be regarded as a flag, when unset, use the lower 5 bits as an index into the colour map as usual. When the flag is set; use the lower 5 bits as an index into the colour map, but the actual colour to be used should be half as bright, which can be achieved by shifted the RGB components of the colour one bit to the right. Alternatively, create a colour map with 64 entries, and copy the lower 32 entries into the upper half, converting them to half brightness; then use all 6 bitplanes as a colour index.

PBM images cannot exist in extra half-brite mode.

=== Hold and Modify ===
If the ILBM file contains a CAMG chunk in which bit 11 is set (i.e. 0x800 in hexadecimal) the file expects to make use of the HAM (Hold-And-Modify) mode of the Amiga chipset. In HAM6 format the colour map will have up to 16 entries, but the image will have 6 (or possibly 5 bitplanes). In HAM8 format the colour map will have up to 64 entries but the image will have 8 (or possibly 7 bitplanes).

The last two bitplanes (if an odd number of bitplanes assume an extra bitplane which is always 0) are control flags which indicate how to use the first 4 (or 6) bitplanes.

If the first pixel of a scanline is a modification pixel, then modify and use the image border colour.

Note that when using 4 bits to modify a colour component you should use the 4 bits in the upper 4 bits of the component AND in the lower 4 bits (to avoid reducing the overall colour gamut). When using 6 bits this is less important, but you can still put the 2 most significant bits of the modification bits into the least significant two bits of the colour component.

PBM images cannot exist in hold and modify mode.

== Utilities ==
Most utilities that work with ILBM and PBM files are rather dated, such as MacPaint or Deluxe Paint. IrfanView allows viewing files, is free for non commercial use, and can work under Linux. Netpbm can convert images from ILBM to its own PPM format and back. The Deluxe Paint-inspired GrafX2
pixel art graphics editor can load and save ILBM files, but is limited to 256 colors maximum, so HAM or 24-bit ILBM images will not show all colors. ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick can also display and convert ILBM images if the &quot;ilbmtoppm&quot; and &quot;ppmtoilbm&quot; utilities from Netpbm are installed.

== Notes ==
In the Commander Keen Dreams series of games, compressed standalone ILBM images are used for title screens, but the game does not read most of the ILBM chunks. This is because the images were edited in DeluxePaint, then imported directly into the game&#x27;s files.

* PNG2ILBM Converts PNG files to ILBM and ACBM format. It can convert any PNG, including alpha channeled and/or 16-bit depth per channel ones. It supports resampling, quantizing, dithering, color register preservation or override on any bitplanes from 1 to 8, including Extra-HalfBrite and Hold And Modify.
* Graphics Workshop 1.1Y from mid-90s can convert from and to all variants of ILBM files; it supports a variety of other image file formats. It is dated but still works on even Windows 10 when running in Windows XP compatibility mode. There is also newer commercial version known as Graphics Workshop Professional with much more modern UI (seeming to be mid-00s), which however is also dated by today&#x27;s standards.
* Ultimate Paint can read, write and display palette color cycle animations.
* XnView&#x27;s nconvert is a free and up to date command line converter.
* Image Converter Plus is a program that will convert ILBM files into any number of formats. While the full version is not free, the demo version adds a watermark that can be removed.
* Paint Shop Pro 7.04 and other older versions of PSP can read and write ILBM, but can only read PBM files. PSP7 gets a special mention as the shareware version has a bug that allows the evaluation shutdown mechanism to be skipped by simply opening a file (i.e. modify shortcut to always open a file and you won&#x27;t be bothered).</text><links>

<text>Valac is a demon described in the goetic grimoires &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; (in some versions as Ualac or Valak and in Thomas Rudd&#x27;s variant as Valu), Johann Weyer&#x27;s &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot; (as Volac), the &quot;Liber Officiorum Spirituum&quot; (as Coolor or Doolas), and in the &quot;Munich Manual of Demonic Magic&quot; (as Volach) as an angelically winged boy riding a two-headed dragon, attributed with the power of finding treasures.

== Variations ==
The &quot;Lesser Key&quot;, the &quot;Munich Manual&quot;, Rudd, and Weyer further agree in ranking Valac as a president and attributing him with the power to locate, summon, and control Oten. The &quot;Officium Spirituum&quot; similarly attributes Doolas with the power to give the summoner command of serpents as well as &quot;household spirits,&quot; but it ranks Coolor and Doolas as princes instead of presidents.

Valac is listed 62nd in the &quot;Lesser Key&quot; (even by Rudd) and the 50th by Weyer, with either version claiming he leads 30 legions of demons (though some manuscripts say 38). The &quot;Munich Manual&quot; describes Volach as controlling 27 legions of spirits. The &quot;Officium Spirituum&quot; (depending on the manuscript) ranks Coolor as either 22nd (with no note of how many spirits he commands) or (in the copy found in the Folger Shakespeare Library) 22nd and commanding 13 legions of spirits. All extant and complete versions of the &quot;Officium Spirituum&quot; list Doolas as 25th demon, commanding 20 legions of spirits.

Rudd&#x27;s version uniquely has Valac opposed by the Shemhamphorasch angel Iahhel.

A manuscript titled &quot;Fasciculus Rerum Geomanticarum&quot; lists him as Volach.

== In popular culture == 
* The 1998 film &quot;Vampires&quot; features a character named &quot;Valek&quot; as the first vampire.
* Volac appears in the &quot;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&quot; comic book series. In issue #7, a young Edward Spellman, father of Sabrina Spellman, summons the demon at the request of Alphonse Louis Constant.
* Ualac appears in the &quot;&quot; as a major antagonist.
* &quot;The Conjuring 2&quot;, &quot;The Nun&quot;, and &quot;The Nun II&quot; has Valak as the main antagonist, taking on the form of a demonic nun and The Crooked Man from the rhyme &quot;There Was a Crooked Man&quot;. &quot;The Nun&quot; revealed that it took the form of a nun to hide amongst the Sisters. In &quot;The Nun&quot; and &quot;The Nun II&quot;, its main weakness is the Blood of Christ. Its ability to block Lorraine&#x27;s visions makes it the most dangerous entity in &quot;The Conjuring&quot; Universe.
* Valac appears as the fourth boss in the video game &quot;&quot;. He is depicted as a two-headed dragon that can fuse to make an even bigger dragon. He appears again in &quot;&quot;.
* Valak appears also in the first season of &quot;Shadowhunters&quot; where it is summoned to retrieve Clary&#x27;s memories back from it.
* The manga series &quot;Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun&quot; has a main character named Clara Valac, a hyperactive demon girl who can make copies of anything she sees.

<text>In biology, dactyly is the arrangement of (fingers and toes) on the hands, feet, or sometimes wings of a tetrapod animal. The term is derived from the Greek word () meaning &quot;finger.&quot;

Sometimes the suffix &quot;-dactylia&quot; is used. The derived adjectives end with &quot;-dactyl&quot; or &quot;-dactylous.&quot;

==As a normal feature==

===Pentadactyly===
Pentadactyly (from Greek &quot;five&quot;) is the condition of having five digits on each limb. It is traditionally believed that all living tetrapods are descended from an ancestor with a pentadactyl limb, although many species have now lost or transformed some or all of their digits by the process of evolution. However, this viewpoint was challenged by Stephen Jay Gould in his 1991 essay &quot;Eight (or Fewer) Little Piggies,&quot; where he pointed out polydactyly in early tetrapods and described the specializations of digit reduction. Despite the individual variations listed below, the relationship is to the original five-digit model.

In reptiles, the limbs are pentadactylous.

Dogs have tetradactylous paws but the dewclaw makes them pentadactyls. Cats also have dewclaws on their front limbs but not their hind limbs, making them both pentadactyls and tetradactyls.

===Tetradactyly===
Tetradactyly (from Greek &#x27;four&#x27;) is the condition of having four digits on a limb, as in many birds, amphibians, and theropod dinosaurs.

===Tridactyly===

Tridactyly (from Greek &#x27;three&#x27;) is the condition of having three digits on a limb, as in the rhinoceros and ancestors of the horse such as &quot;Protohippus&quot; and &quot;Hipparion&quot;. These all belong to the Perissodactyla. Some birds also have three toes, including emus, bustards, and quail.

===Didactyly===
Didactyly (from Greek &#x27;two&#x27;) or bidactyly is the condition of having two digits on each limb, as in the Hypertragulidae and two-toed sloth, &quot;Choloepus didactylus&quot;. In humans this name is used for an abnormality in which the middle digits are missing, leaving only the thumb and fifth finger, or big and little toes. Cloven-hoofed mammals (such as deer, sheep and cattle – &quot;Artiodactyla&quot;) have only two digits, as do ostriches.

===Monodactyly===
Monodactyly (from Greek &#x27;one&#x27;) is the condition of having a single digit on a limb, as in modern horses and other equidae (though one study suggests that the frog might be composed of remnants of digits II and IV, rendering horses as not truly monodactyl) as well as sthenurine kangaroos. Functional monodactyly, where the weight is supported on only one of multiple toes, can also occur, as in the theropod dinosaur &quot;Vespersaurus&quot;. The pterosaur &quot;Nyctosaurus&quot; retained only the wing finger on the forelimb, rendering it also partially monodactyl.

==As a congenital defect==

Among humans, the term &quot;five-fingered hand&quot; is sometimes used to mean the abnormality of having five fingers, none of which is a thumb.

===Syndactyly===

Syndactyly (from Greek &#x27;together&#x27;) is a condition where two or more digits are fused together. It occurs normally in some mammals, such as the siamang and most diprotodontid marsupials such as kangaroos. It occurs as an unusual condition in humans.

===Polydactyly===

Polydactyly (from Greek &#x27;many&#x27;) is when a limb has more than the usual number of digits. This can be:
* As a result of congenital abnormality in a normally pentadactyl animal. Polydactyly is very common among domestic cats. For more information, see polydactyly.
* Polydactyly in early tetrapod aquatic animals, such as in &quot;Acanthostega gunnari&quot; (Jarvik 1952), one of an increasing number of genera of stem-tetrapods known from the Upper Devonian, which are providing insights into the appearance of tetrapods and the origin of limbs with digits. It also occurs secondarily in some later tetrapods, such as ichthyosaurs. The use of a term normally reserved for congenital defects reflects that it was regarded as an anomaly at the time, as it was believed that all modern tetrapods have either five digits or ancestors that did.

===Oligodactyly===

Oligodactyly (from Greek &#x27;few&#x27;) is having too few digits when not caused by an amputation. It is sometimes incorrectly called hypodactyly or confused with aphalangia, the absence of the phalanx bone on one or (commonly) more digits. When &quot;all&quot; the digits on a hand or foot are absent, it is referred to as &quot;adactyly&quot;.

====Ectrodactyly====

Ectrodactyly, also known as &quot;split-hand malformation&quot;, is the congenital absence of one or more central digits of the hands and feet. Consequently, it is a form of oligodactyly. News anchor Bree Walker is probably the best-known person with this condition, which affects about one in 91,000 people. It is conspicuously more common in the Vadoma in Zimbabwe.
===Clinodactyly===

Clinodactyly is a medical term describing the curvature of a digit (a finger or toe) in the plane of the palm, most commonly the fifth finger (the &quot;little finger&quot;) towards the adjacent fourth finger (the &quot;ring finger&quot;). It is a fairly common isolated anomaly which often goes unnoticed, but also occurs in combination with other abnormalities in certain genetic syndromes, such as Down syndrome, Turner syndrome and Cornelia de Lange syndrome.

==In birds==


===Anisodactyly===
Anisodactyly is the most common arrangement of digits in birds, with three toes forward and one back. This is common in songbirds and other perching birds, as well as hunting birds such as eagles, hawks, and falcons. This arrangement of digits helps with perching and/or climbing and clinging.
This occurs in Passeriformes, Columbiformes, Falconiformes, Accipitriformes, Galliformes and a majority of other birds.

===Syndactyly===
Syndactyly, as it occurs in birds, is like anisodactyly, except that the third and fourth toes (the outer and middle forward-pointing toes), or three toes, are fused together almost to their claws, as in the belted kingfisher (&quot;Megaceryle alcyon&quot;). This is often found in Picocoraciae, though rollers, ground rollers, and Piciformes (who are zygodactyl) are exceptions.

===Zygodactyly===

Zygodactyly (from Greek , even-numbered) is an arrangement of digits in birds and chameleons, with two toes facing forward (digits 2 and 3) and two back (digits 1 and 4). This arrangement is most common in arboreal species, particularly those that climb tree trunks or clamber through foliage. Zygodactyly occurs in the parrots, woodpeckers (including flickers), cuckoos (including roadrunners), and some owls. Zygodactyl tracks have been found dating to 120–110 million years ago (early Cretaceous), 50 million years before the first identified zygodactyl fossils. All Psittaciformes, Cuculiformes, the majority of Piciformes and the osprey are zygodactyl.

===Heterodactyly===
Heterodactyly is like zygodactyly, except that digits 3 and 4 point forward and digits 1 and 2 point back. This is found only in trogons, though the enantiornithean &quot;Dalingheornis&quot; might also have had this arrangement.

===Pamprodactyly===
Pamprodactyly is an arrangement in which all four toes point forward, outer toes (toe 1 and sometimes 4) often if not regularly reversible. It is a characteristic of swifts (Apodidae) and mousebirds (Coliiformes).

==Chameleons==
The feet of chameleons are organized into bundles of a group of two and a group of three digits which oppose one another to grasp branches in a pincer-like arrangement. This condition has been called zygodactyly or didactyly, but the specific arrangement in chameleons does not fit either definition. The feet of the front limbs in chameleons, for instance, are organized into a medial bundle of digits 1, 2 and 3, and a lateral bundle of digits 4 and 5, while the feet of the hind limbs are organized into a medial bundle of digits 1 and 2, and a lateral bundle of digits 3, 4 and 5. On the other hand, zygodactyly involves digits 1 and 4 opposing digits 2 and 3, which is an arrangement that chameleons do not exhibit in either front or hind limbs.

== Aquatic tetrapods ==
In many secondarily aquatic vertebrates, the non-bony tissues of the forelimbs and/or hindlimbs are fused into a single flipper. Some remnant of each digit generally remains under the soft tissue of the flipper, though digit reduction gradually occurs such as in baleen whales (mysticeti). Marine mammals evolving flippers represents a classic example of convergent evolution, and by some analyses, parallel evolution.

Full webbing of the digits in the manus and/or pes is present in a number of aquatic tetrapods. Such animals include marine mammals (cetaceans, sirenians, and pinnipeds), marine reptiles (modern sea turtles and extinct ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, metriorhynchids), and flightless aquatic birds such as penguins. Hyperphalangy, or an increase in the number of phalanges beyond ancestral mammal and reptile conditions, is present in modern cetaceans and extinct marine reptiles.

==Schizodactyly==
Schizodactyly is a primate term for grasping and clinging with the second and third digit, instead of the thumb and second digit.

<text>Bram Cohen is an American computer programmer, best known as the author of the peer-to-peer (P2P) BitTorrent protocol in 2001, as well as the first file sharing program to use the protocol, also known as BitTorrent. He is also the co-founder of CodeCon and organizer of the San Francisco Bay Area P2P-hackers meeting, was the co-author of Codeville and creator of the Chia cryptocurrency which implements the proof of space-time consensus algorithm.

==Early life and career==
Cohen grew up in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City, as the son of a teacher and computer scientist. He claims he learned the BASIC programming language at the age of 5 on his family&#x27;s Timex Sinclair computer. Cohen passed the American Invitational Mathematics Examination to qualify for the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad while he attended Stuyvesant High School in New York City. He graduated from Stuyvesant in 1993 and attended SUNY Buffalo. He later dropped out of college to work for several dot com companies throughout the mid to late 1990s, the last being MojoNation, an ambitious but ill-fated project he worked on with Jim McCoy.

MojoNation allowed people to break up confidential files into encrypted chunks and distribute those pieces on computers also running the software. If someone wanted to download a copy of this encrypted file, they would have to download it simultaneously from many computers. This concept, Cohen thought, was perfect for a file sharing program, since programs like KaZaA take a long time to download a large file because the file is (usually) coming from one source (or &quot;peer&quot;). Cohen designed BitTorrent to be able to download files from many sources, thus 
speeding up the download time, especially for users with faster download than upload speeds. Thus, the more popular a file is, the faster a user will be able to download it, since many people will be downloading it at the same time, and these people will also be uploading the data to other users.
==BitTorrent==
In April 2001, Cohen quit MojoNation and began work on BitTorrent. Cohen unveiled his ideas at the first CodeCon conference, which he and his roommate Len Sassaman created as a showcase event for novel technology projects after becoming disillusioned with the state of technology conferences.

Cohen wrote the first BitTorrent client implementation in Python, and many other programs have since implemented the protocol.

In the summer of 2002, Cohen collected free pornography to lure beta testers to use the program. BitTorrent gained its fame for its ability to quickly share large music and movie files online. Cohen has claimed he has never violated copyright law using his software. Regardless, he is outspoken in his belief that the current media business was doomed to being outmoded despite the RIAA and MPAA&#x27;s legal or technical tactics, such as digital rights management. In May 2005, Cohen released a trackerless beta version of BitTorrent.

In late 2003, Cohen had a short career at Valve, working on Steam, their digital distribution system introduced for &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;. 

By 2004, he had left Valve and formed BitTorrent, Inc. with his brother Ross Cohen and business partner Ashwin Navin. In 2012 he announced a beta-version of BitTorrent Live for TV broadcasting through the Internet. Cohen left BitTorrent, Inc. in a day to day capacity to co-found Chia Network in the fall of 2017.

===BitTorrent and the MPAA===
By mid-2005, BitTorrent, Inc. was funded by venture capitalist David Chao from Doll Capital Management, and in late 2005 Cohen and Navin made a deal with the MPAA to remove links to illegal content on the official BitTorrent website. The deal was with the seven largest studios in America. The agreement means the site will comply with procedures outlined in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

==Chia Network==

Chia Network is a company founded by Cohen in 2017 that has implemented a proof of space-time cryptocurrency called Chia. Chia is intended to avoid the waste of energy involved in proof-of-work-based cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and the vulnerability to state actors of proof-of-stake systems.

Chia Network has raised seed money from investors including Andreessen Horowitz. The use of storage media (hard disk and solid-state drives) as the cryptocurrency&#x27;s mining medium has raised concerns over potential price surges and shortage of high-capacity storage devices, as well as radically reducing the lifetime of drives.

==Personal life==
As of 2008, Cohen lived in the San Francisco Bay Area of the United States, with his wife Jenna and their three children.

Cohen says that he has Asperger syndrome based on a self diagnosis.

Cohen&#x27;s hobbies include original origami and juggling up to five balls, but his main interest is in recreational mathematics. Cohen maintains a blog where he frequently discusses trust metrics with software developer Raph Levien, as well as money systems, games of skill, and other math-related topics. He is also an assembly puzzle enthusiast. He has designed several puzzles including some in conjunction with Oskar van Deventer including several gear-based puzzles such as Gear Shift and a multiple Rubik&#x27;s Cube variant called Bram&#x27;s Fortress. Some of Cohen&#x27;s puzzle designs are available for 3-D printing via Shapeways.

==Awards==
Cohen has received a number of awards for his work on the BitTorrent protocol. These awards include:
* 2004 &quot;Wired&quot; Rave Award
* 2005 &quot;MIT Technology Review&quot; &quot;TR&quot;35 as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35
* 2005 &quot;Time&quot; 100 Most Influential People
* 2006 USENIX STUG Award
* 2010 Internet Evolution 100

<text>Pattern Recognition is a novel by science fiction writer William Gibson published in 2003. Set in August and September 2002, the story follows Cayce Pollard, a 32-year-old marketing consultant who has a psychological sensitivity to corporate symbols. The action takes place in London, Tokyo, and Moscow as Cayce judges the effectiveness of a proposed corporate symbol and is hired to seek the creators of film clips anonymously posted to the internet.

The novel&#x27;s central theme involves the examination of the human desire to detect patterns or meaning and the risks of finding patterns in meaningless data. Other themes include methods of interpretation of history, cultural familiarity with brand names, and tensions between art and commercialization. The September 11, 2001 attacks are used as a motif representing the transition to the new century. Critics identify influences in &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; from Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s postmodern detective story &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;.

&quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; is Gibson&#x27;s eighth novel and his first one to be set in the contemporary world. Like his previous work, it has been classified as a science fiction and postmodern novel, with the action unfolding along a thriller plot line. Critics approved of the writing but found the plot unoriginal and some of the language distracting. The book peaked at number four on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, was nominated for the 2003 British Science Fiction Association Award, and was shortlisted for the 2004 Arthur C. Clarke Award and Locus Awards.

== Background ==
Before writing &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot;, the author, William Gibson, published seven novels (one co-written) and numerous short stories beginning in 1977. His previous novel, &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot;, was published in October 1999 as the conclusion of the Bridge trilogy. &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; was written between 2001 and 2002 while Gibson was living in Vancouver, British Columbia and released in February 2003. &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; was originally intended to be a stand-alone novel, but afterwards Gibson wrote &quot;Spook Country&quot; and &quot;Zero History&quot; which take place in the same universe and use some of the same characters.

Gibson traveled to Tokyo in 2001 to prepare for this new novel, which takes place in London, Moscow, and Tokyo. He did not travel to London or Moscow but used interviews with friends and internet resources for research. In September 2001 Gibson had written about 100 pages but was struggling to finish. He stopped writing after watching the September 11, 2001 attacks on television and &quot;realized [the novel] had become a story that took place in an alternate time track, in which Sept. 11 hadn&#x27;t happened&quot;. He considered abandoning the novel but a few weeks later re-wrote portions to use the attacks as a motivating factor for the distress the main character feels. In a 2003 interview he said, &quot;There I was, in the winter of 2001, with no idea what the summer of 2002 was going to be like. ... In the original post-9/11 draft, London felt more like London is feeling right now. Cayce keeps seeing trucks full of soldiers. But I took that out, because as it got closer to the time, it wasn&#x27;t actually happening.&quot;

== Plot summary ==
Advertising consultant Cayce Pollard, who reacts to logos and advertising as if to an allergen, arrives in London in August 2002. She is working on a contract with the marketing firm Blue Ant to judge the effectiveness of a proposed corporate logo for a shoe company. During the presentation, graphic designer Dorotea Benedetti becomes hostile towards Cayce as she rejects the first proposal. After dinner with some Blue Ant employees, the company founder Hubertus Bigend offers Cayce a new contract: to uncover who is responsible for distributing a series of anonymous, artistic film clips via the internet. Cayce had been following the film clips and participating in an online discussion forum theorizing on the clips&#x27; meaning, setting, and other aspects. Wary of corrupting the artistic process and mystery of the clips, she reluctantly accepts. Cayce is not entirely comfortable with Ivy&#x27;s chat group called &quot;Fetish:Footage:Forum&quot; (or F:F:F), as shown by the following excerpt:

A friend from the discussion group, who uses the handle Parkaboy, privately emails her saying a friend of a friend has discovered an encrypted watermark on one clip. They concoct a fake persona, a young woman named Keiko, to seduce the Japanese man who knows the watermark code. Cayce, along with an American computer security specialist, Boone Chu, hired to assist her, travels to Tokyo to meet the man and retrieve the watermark code. Two men attempt to steal the code but Cayce escapes and travels back to London. Boone travels to Columbus, Ohio to investigate the company that he believes created the watermark. Meanwhile, Blue Ant hires Dorotea who reveals that she was previously employed by a Russian lawyer whose clients have been investigating Cayce. The clients wanted Cayce to refuse the job of tracking the film clips and it was Dorotea&#x27;s responsibility to ensure this.

Through a completely random encounter Cayce meets Voytek Biroshak and Ngemi, the former an artist using old ZX81 microcomputers as a sculpture medium, the latter a collector of rare technology (he mentions purchasing Stephen King&#x27;s word processor, for example). Another collector, and sometime &#x27;friend&#x27; of Ngemi&#x27;s, Hobbs Baranov, is a retired cryptographer and mathematician with connections in the American National Security Agency. Cayce strikes a deal with him: she buys a Curta calculator for him and he finds the email address to which the watermark code was sent. Using this email address Cayce makes contact with Stella Volkova whose sister Nora is the maker of the film clips.

Cayce flies to Moscow to meet Stella in person and watch Nora work. Nora is brain damaged from an assassination attempt and can only express herself through film. At her hotel, Cayce is intercepted and drugged by Dorotea and wakes up in a mysterious prison facility. Cayce escapes; exhausted, disoriented and lost, she nearly collapses as Parkaboy, who upon Cayce&#x27;s request was flown to Moscow, retrieves her and brings her to the prison where the film is processed. There Hubertus, Stella and Nora&#x27;s uncle Andrei, and the latter&#x27;s security employees are waiting for her. Over dinner with Cayce, the Russians reveal that they have been spying on her since she posted to a discussion forum speculating that the clips may be controlled by the Russian Mafia. They had let her track the clips to expose any security breaches in their distribution network. The Russians surrender all the information they had collected on her father&#x27;s disappearance and the book ends with Cayce coming to terms with his absence while in Paris with Parkaboy, whose real name is Peter Gilbert.

== Characters ==
* Cayce Pollard – A 32-year-old woman who lives in New York City. She pronounces her given name &quot;Case&quot; although her parents named her after Edgar Cayce. She uses her interest in marketing trends and fads, and her psychological sensitivity to logos and advertising, in her work as an advertising consultant. Her sensitivity becomes a phobia towards older corporate mascots, especially the Michelin Man. She wears only black, gray or white, usually Fruit of the Loom shrunken cotton T-shirts (all tags removed) with Levis jeans (with the trademarks filed off the buttons) or skirts, tights, boots, as well as a black Buzz Rickson MA-1 bomber jacket. (Buzz Rickson did not produce the MA-1 in black, but due to demand created by the novel, began offering a &quot;William Gibson collection&quot; black MA-1.)
* Hubertus Bigend – The 35-year-old founder of advertising agency &quot;Blue Ant&quot;. He was born in Belgium but educated at a British boarding school and at Harvard University.
* Dorotea Benedetti – The representative of the graphic design company. She has a background in industrial espionage and is secretly hired to encourage Cayce to leave London without accepting Bigend&#x27;s offer to track the film clips.
* Bernard Stonestreet – A representative of the advertising agency &quot;Blue Ant&quot;.
* &quot;Parkaboy&quot;/Peter Gilbert – Cayce&#x27;s friend from the online discussion forum. He lives in Chicago and describes himself as a &quot;middle-aged white guy since 1967&quot;.
* Boone Chu – A Chinese-American living in Washington state, but raised in Oklahoma. He had a failed start-up company specializing in security. He is hired to assist Cayce in the search for the maker of the footage.
* Voytek Biroshak – A blond man born in Poland and raised in Russia. He acquires and sells antique calculators to raise funds for an exhibition on Sinclair ZX81 computers.
* Damien Pease – A 30-year-old friend of Cayce whose flat she stays at while in London. He is a video director shooting a documentary on WWII battleground excavation near Stalingrad.
* Hobbs Baranov – A former NSA cryptographer and mathematician. He collects antique calculators and sells intelligence as he squats near Poole with a Gypsy group.
* – Creator of website, discussion group, and chatroom Fetish:Footage:Forum that Cayce frequents. The website&#x27;s intention is to discuss the anonymous film postings.

== Style and story elements ==
The novel uses a third-person narrative in the present tense with a somber tone reminiscent of a &quot;low-level post-apocalypticism&quot;. Cayce&#x27;s memories of the September 11, 2001 attacks, which briefly use the future tense, are told by Gibson as &quot;a Benjaminian seed of time&quot;, as one reviewer calls it, because of the monistic and lyrical descriptions of Cayce&#x27;s relationship to objects with the attacks in the background. Two neologisms appear in the novel: &quot;gender-bait&quot; and &quot;mirror-world&quot;. Gibson created the term &quot;mirror-world&quot; to acknowledge a locational-specific distinction in a manufactured object that emerged from a parallel development process, for example opposite-side driving or varied electrical outlets. &quot;Gender-bait&quot; refers to a male posing as a female online to elicit positive responses. The term &quot;coolhunter&quot;, not coined by Gibson but used in the marketing industry for several years, is used to describe Cayce&#x27;s profession of identifying the roots of emerging trends.

The September 11, 2001 attacks are used as a motif representing a break with the past with Cayce&#x27;s father, who disappears during the attacks, as the personification of the 20th century. Gibson viewed the attacks as a nodal point after which &quot;nothing is really the same&quot;. One reviewer commented that in &quot;Gibson&#x27;s view, 9-11 was the end of history; after it we are without a history, careening toward an unknown future without the benefit of a past—our lives before 9-11 are now irrelevant.&quot; Cayce&#x27;s search for her father and Damien&#x27;s excavation of the German bomber symbolize the historicist search for a method to interpret people&#x27;s actions in the past. Coming to terms with her father&#x27;s disappearance may be interpreted as a requiem for those lost to the 20th century, something that may have been influenced by Gibson coming to terms with the loss of his own father.

The film clips are a motif used to enhance the theme of the desire to find meaning or detect patterns. They are released over the internet and gain a cult following, in the same way that the lonelygirl15 videoblog gained an international following in 2006. Corporate interest in the footage is aroused by its originality and global distribution methods. The characters debate whether the anonymous clips are part of a complete narrative or a work in progress, and when or where they were shot. This enigmatic nature of the footage is said to metaphorically represent the nature of the confusing and uncertain post-9/11 future. The author Dennis Danvers has remarked that the footage being edited down to a single frame is like the world compressed into a single novel. The footage, released freely to a global audience with a lack of time or place indicators, has also been contrasted to &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; written under contract for a large corporation and which uses liminal name-dropping that definitively sets it in London, Tokyo, and Moscow in 2002.

== Major themes ==

=== Pattern recognition ===

The central theme throughout the novel involves the natural human propensity to search for meaning with the constant risk of apophenia. Followers of the seemingly random clips seek connections and meaningfulness in them but are revealed to be victims of apophenia as the clips are just edited surveillance camera footage. Likewise, Cayce&#x27;s mother turns to investigating electronic voice phenomena after Cayce&#x27;s father disappears. Science fiction critic Thomas Wagner underscores the desire for meaning, or pattern recognition, using a comparison between the film clips and Cayce&#x27;s search for her father after the attacks: [T]he very randomness and ineffability of the clips flies in the face of our natural human tendency towards pattern recognition ... [T]he subculture that surrounds &quot;following the footage&quot; ... [is] an effective plot device for underscoring the novel&#x27;s post-9/11 themes: to wit, the uncertainty of the fabric of day-to-day life people began to feel following that event … [We] as people don&#x27;t like uncertainty, don&#x27;t like knowing that there&#x27;s something we can&#x27;t comprehend. And if we can&#x27;t fit something into an existing pattern, then by golly we&#x27;ll come up with one. Within the marketing world, Cayce is portrayed not as an outside rebel, but rather a paragon of the system. Inescapably within the system, she seeks an epistemological perspective to objectively interpret patterns. The review of the novel in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; calls this search &quot;a survival tactic within the context of no context—dowsing for meaning, and sometimes settling for the illusion of meaning&quot;.

=== Memory of history ===

Using 20th-century relics, such as a Curta calculator, an excavated Stuka, Hobbs Baranov, and Voytek&#x27;s planned ZX81 show, Gibson raises the question of how a contemporary society views past societies. Gibson portrays the past century as dominated by conflict, suspicion, and espionage. Following the disappearance of Cayce&#x27;s father, a designer of embassy security systems, on September 11, 2001, Cayce is left feeling &quot;ungrieved&quot; until she reviews footage and records of that day tracking his movements until he vanishes.

Following this line of thought Gibson raises the question of how the future will view today&#x27;s society. The novel &quot;adopts a postmodern historicism&quot; perspective, through the arguments presented by Bigend, Cayce, and Parkaboy. Bigend and Cayce&#x27;s view of history are compared to those of philosopher Benedetto Croce in that they believe history is open for interpretation when re-written from the frame of reference of another society. Parkaboy rejects this view, believing that history can be an exact science.

=== Originality and monoculture ===
The book explores a tension between originality and monoculture by focusing on the artist&#x27;s relationship with a commercialized world and its marketing of free art and consumer products. Critic Lisa Zeidner argues that the artist&#x27;s &quot;loyalty and love&quot; involved with creating originality counters Bigend&#x27;s assertion that everything is a reflection of something else and that the creative process no longer rests with the individual. Commercialism is portrayed as a monoculture that assimilates originality. The Tommy Hilfiger brand is used as an example, &quot;simulacra of simulacra of simulacra. A dilute tincture of Ralph Lauren, who had himself diluted the glory days of Brooks Brothers, who themselves had stepped on the product of Jermyn Street and Savile Row ... There must be some Tommy Hilfiger event horizon, beyond which it is impossible to be more derivative, more removed from the source, more devoid of soul.&quot;

One critic points out that the marketing agency Blue Ant is named after the wasp Blue Ant: &quot;it&#x27;s a wasp with a painful sting. The female hunts for a ground-dwelling cricket. She paralyses it with a sting and lays her egg on it. The still living yet immobile cricket becomes food for the wasp&#x27;s young. What a clever metaphor for the process of targeting, commodifying, and marketing cool.&quot; On the other hand, as Rudy Rucker notes, while new art is constantly threatened by commodification, it is dependent on the monoculture for its launching point and uniqueness. Gibson&#x27;s product positioning language and Cayce&#x27;s analysis of consumerist trends show that society is not a victim of consumerism, but rather its creator who helps shape it without ever stepping outside it. Alex Link argues that rather than a simple attack on consumerism outright, the novel outlines a complex interrelationship between art, brand design, and terrorism as varying attitudes to history, terror, and community.

=== Branding, identity, and globalization ===
The novel&#x27;s language is viewed as rife with labeling and product placements. Postmodern theorist Fredric Jameson calls it &quot;a kind of hyped-up name-dropping ... [where] an encyclopaedic familiarity with the fashions ... [creates] class status as a matter of knowing the score rather than of having money and power&quot;. He also calls it &quot;postmodern nominalism&quot; in that the names express the new and fashionable. This name-dropping demonstrates how commercialism has created and named new objects and experiences and renamed (or re-created) some that already existed. This naming includes nationalities; there are eight references to nationality (or locality) in the first three pages. Zeidner wrote that the novel&#x27;s &quot;new century is unsettlingly transitional making it difficult to maintain an individual identity&quot;. One character argues that &quot;there will soon be no national identity left … [as] all experience [will be] reduced, by the spectral hand of marketing, to price-point variations on the same thing.&quot; This is juxtaposed against the footage that contains no hints of time period or location. Globalization is represented by characters of varying nationalities, ease of international travel, portable instant communication, and commercial monoculture recognizable across international markets. As an example, Gibson writes how one &#x27;yes or no&#x27; decision by Cayce on the logo will impact the lives of the people in remote places who will manufacture the logos and how it will infect their dreams.

== Genre ==
While some reviewers regard the novel as a thriller, others see it as an example of post-millennial science fiction with stories set in the &quot;technocultural future-present&quot;. Some reviewers note that the novel furthers the post-millennial trend in science fiction of illustrating society&#x27;s inability to imagine a definitive future and the use of technologies once considered advanced or academic now commonplace within society and its vernacular. Gibson said that the only science fiction elements are &quot;[t]he Footage and Cayce&#x27;s special talents&quot; but that he &quot;never bought that conceit that science fiction is about the future&quot;. Dennis Danvers explained the use of science fiction as a narrative strategy: [s]cience fiction, in effect, has become a narrative strategy, a way of approaching story, in which not only characters must be invented, but the world and its ways as well, without resorting to magic or the supernatural, where the fantasy folks work. A realist wrestling with the woes of the middle class can leave the world out of it by and large except for an occasional swipe at the shallowness of suburbia. A science fiction writer must invent the world where the story takes place, often from the ground up, a process usually called world-building. In other words, in a science fiction novel, the world itself is a distinctive and crucial character in the plot, without whom the story could not take place, whether it&#x27;s the world of Dune or Neuromancer or 1984. The world is the story as much as the story is in the world. Part of Gibson&#x27;s point ... is that we live in a time of such accelerated change and layered realities, that we&#x27;re all in that boat, like it or not. A novel set in the &quot;real world&quot; now has to answer the question, &quot;Which one?&quot;

These elements, and the use of the September 11, 2001 attacks as a breaking point from the past, led academics to label it a postmodern novel. The attacks mark the point where the &#x27;modern&#x27;, that is the 20th-century certainty in society&#x27;s advancement towards a better future, changed to the &#x27;postmodern&#x27;, that is the 21st-century uncertainty in which future will develop. Fredric Jameson finds Gibson using culture as the determinant of change for the first time with this novel, rather than technology. Jameson focuses on the novel&#x27;s &quot;postmodern nominalism&quot; that uses brand names to refresh old objects and experiences.

In post-structural literary theory Cayce is compared with the main character, Oedipa Maas, of Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; as detectives interpreting clues but with neither the character nor the reader knowing if there actually is a pattern to be found and, if there is one, whether it is real or conspiracy. Gibson&#x27;s use of name-dropping brands to create a sense of &quot;in-group style … of those in the know&quot; is traced back to Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s 1963 novel &quot;V.&quot; . Gibson&#x27;s writing style is said to be similar to Raymond Chandler&#x27;s detective stories and Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s thrillers that used MacGuffins (the identity of the maker of the footage, in this case) to drive the story. Gibson&#x27;s social observations are influenced by the works of Naomi Klein and Malcolm Gladwell.

While markedly different from his previous writing, in that it is not set in an imaginary future with imaginary technologies, &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; includes many of his previous elements, including impacts of technology shifts on society, Japanese computer experts and Russian mafia figures. In common with Gibson&#x27;s previous work, Paul Di Filippo found in &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot;: &quot;the close observation of the culture&#x27;s bleeding edge; an analysis of the ways technology molds our every moment; the contrasting of boardroom with street; the impossibility and dire necessity of making art in the face of instant co-optation; the damaged loner facing the powers-that-be, for both principle and profit&quot;.

== Reception ==
&quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; was released on February 3, 2003, as Gibson launched a 15-city tour. The novel was featured on the January 19 cover of &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;. In the American market it peaked at number four on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for hardcover fiction on February 23 and spent nine weeks on &quot;USA Today&#x27;s&quot; Top 150 Best-Selling Books peaking at number 34. In the Canadian market, the novel peaked at number three on &quot;The Globe and Mail&#x27;s&quot; best seller list on February 15 in the hardcover fiction category. The novel was shortlisted for the 2004 Arthur C. Clarke Award and the British Science Fiction Association Award.

Gibson&#x27;s writing was positively received by science fiction writers Dennis Danvers, Candas Jane Dorsey, and Rudy Rucker. Rucker has written: &quot;[w]ith a poet&#x27;s touch, he tiles words into wonderful mosaics&quot; and Danvers wrote that &quot;no sentence has a subject if it can do without one&quot;. One critic found the prose to be as &quot;hard and compact as glacier ice&quot; and another that it &quot;gives us sharply observed small moments inscribed with crystalline clarity&quot;. Gibson&#x27;s descriptions of interiors and of the built environments of Tokyo, Russia and London were singled out as impressive, and &quot;The Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s review remarked that &quot;Gibson expertly replicates the biosphere of a discussion board: the coffee-shop intimacy, the fishbowl paranoia, the splintering factions, the inevitable flame war&quot;. Lisa Zeidner of &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; elaborated: As usual, Gibson&#x27;s prose is ... corpuscular, crenelated. His sentences slide from silk to steel, and take tonal joy rides from the ironic to the earnest. But he never gets lost in the language, as he sometimes has in the past. Structurally, this may be his most confident novel. The secondary characters and their subplots are more fully developed, right down to their personal e-mail styles. Without any metafictional grandstanding, Gibson nails the texture of Internet culture: how it feels to be close to someone you know only as a voice in a chat room, or to fret about someone spying on your browser&#x27;s list of sites visited. Filled with name-dropping of businesses and products, such as MUJI, Hotmail, iBook, Netscape, and G4, the language of the novel was judged by one critic to be &quot;awkward in its effort to appear &quot;cool&quot; &quot; while other critics have found it overdone and feared it would quickly date the novel. The &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; review commented that the &quot;constant, unadulterated &quot;hipster-technocrat, cyber-MTV&quot; lingo [is] overdone and inappropriate&quot; On the technology, Cory Doctorow found Gibson&#x27;s use of watermarks and keystroke logging to be hollow and has noted that &quot;Gibson is no technologist, he&#x27;s an accomplished and insightful social critic ... and he treats these items from the real world as metaphor. But ... Gibson&#x27;s metaphorical treatment of these technologies will date this very fine book&quot;.

Some critics found the plot to be a conventional &quot;unravel-the-secret&quot; and &quot;woman on a quest&quot; thriller. Toby Litt wrote that &quot;[j]udged just as a thriller, &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; takes too long to kickstart, gives its big secrets away before it should and never puts the heroine in believable peril&quot;. The conclusion, called &quot;unnecessarily pat&quot; by one critic, was compared by Litt with the &quot;ultimate fantasy ending of 1980s movies – the heroine has lucked out without selling out, has kept her integrity but still ended up filthy rich.&quot; The review in the &quot;Library Journal&quot; called the novel a &quot;melodrama of beset geekdom&quot; that &quot;may well reveal the emptiness at the core of Gibson&#x27;s other fiction&quot;, but recommended it for all libraries due to the author&#x27;s popularity.

== Publication history ==

The hardcover edition, released in February 2003, was published by the Penguin Group imprint G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons. Berkley Books published the trade paperback one year later, on February 3, 2004, and a mass market paperback in February 2005. In the UK the paperback was published by Penguin Books a year after its Viking Press imprint published the hardcover version. In 2004 it was published in French, Danish, Japanese, German, and Spanish. In 2005 the book was published in Russia. The translation made by Nikita Krasnikov was awarded as the best translation of the year.

Tantor Media published the 10.5-hour-long, unabridged audiobook on April 1, 2004, and re-released it on January 1, 2005. Voiced by Shelly Frasier, it was criticized by John Adams of &quot;Locus&quot; as being pleasant but with distracting dialects.

== Adaptations ==
The digital radio station BBC 7 broadcast (now BBC Radio 4 Extra) an abridged version of the novel, voiced by Lorelei King, in five 30-minute episodes in February and October 2007. Post-punk band Sonic Youth included a track called &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; on their 2004 album &quot;Sonic Nurse&quot; that opens with the lyric &quot;I&#x27;m a cool hunter making you my way&quot;. A film adaptation was initiated in April 2004 with producer Steve Golin&#x27;s production company Anonymous Content and the studio Warner Bros. Pictures hiring director Peter Weir. Screenwriters David Arata, D. B. Weiss, and Weir co-wrote the screenplay but in May 2007, Gibson commented on his personal blog that he believed Weir would not be proceeding with the project.

<doc id="265668" wikidata="Q4038018" url="?curid=265668" title="Embarrassed">
<text>&quot;Embarrassed&quot; is a song by American rapper and singer Don Toliver featuring fellow American rapper and singer Travis Scott. It was released through Cactus Jack and Atlantic Records as the second track from the deluxe edition of Toliver&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Love Sick&quot;, on February 28, 2023. Toliver and Scott wrote the song alongside Cash and Dougie F and with producers Wheezy and Dez Wright. On the same day as its release, Toliver performed at Irving Plaza in New York City, in which he brought Scott out as a special guest to perform the song for the first time, along with some other songs.

==Composition and critical reception==
Over a psychedelic instrumental, Toliver and Scott individually sing on the chorus: &quot;New checks on me, they clear / Got her naked on the terrace / Got my diamonds on in Paris / Got my diamonds on, embarrassed&quot;. The two artists reference their luxurious items like diamonds and sexual encounters. Maximilian Diehl of &quot;Baylor Lariat&quot; felt that &quot;this song is a genuine disappointment to me&quot;, saying that &quot;maybe it&#x27;s less &#x27;bad&#x27; than it is underwhelming for having the continually dynamic &#x27;Astroworld&#x27; star make an appearance&quot;.

<text>The laughing gull (Leucophaeus atricilla) is a medium-sized gull of North and South America. Named for its laugh-like call, it is an opportunistic omnivore and scavenger. It breeds in large colonies mostly along the Atlantic coast of North America, the Caribbean, and northern South America. The two subspecies are &quot;L. a. megalopterus&quot; — which can be seen from southeast Canada down to Central America — and &quot;L. a. atricilla&quot;, which appears from the West Indies to the Venezuelan islands. The laughing gull was long placed in the genus &quot;Larus&quot; until its present placement in &quot;Leucophaeus&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The laughing gull was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Larus atricilla&quot;. Linnaeus based his account on the &quot;laughing gull&quot; from the Bahamas that had been described and illustrated in 1729–1732 by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot;. The laughing gull is now one of five New World gulls placed in the genus &quot;Leucophaeus&quot; that was introduced in 1855 by the German ornithologist Carl Friedrich Bruch. The genus name &quot;Leucophaeus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;leukos&quot; meaning &quot;white&quot; and &quot;phaios&quot; meaning &quot;dusky&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;atricilla&quot; combines Latin &quot;ater&quot; meaning &quot;black&quot; with Modern Latin &quot;cilla&quot; meaning &quot;tail&quot;. It is possible that Linnaeus intended to write &quot;atricapilla&quot; meaning &quot;black-headed&quot;.

Like most other members of the genus &quot;Leucophaeus&quot;, the laughing gull was long placed in the genus &quot;Larus&quot;. It was moved to the resurrected genus &quot;Leucophaeus&quot; based on a 2005 molecular phylogenetic study that found that inclusion in &quot;Larus&quot; made that genus paraphyletic.

Two subspecies are recognised. They are listed below with their breeding ranges.
==Description==
This species is long with a wingspan and a weight range of . The summer adult&#x27;s body is white apart from the dark grey back and wings and black head. Its wings are much darker grey than all other gulls of similar size except the smaller Franklin&#x27;s gull, and they have black tips without the white crescent shown by Franklin&#x27;s. The beak is long and red. The black hood is mostly lost in winter.

Laughing gulls take three years to reach adult plumage. Immature birds are always darker than most similar-sized gulls other than Franklin&#x27;s. First-year birds are greyer below and have paler heads than first-year Franklin&#x27;s, and second-years can be distinguished by the wing pattern and structure.

==Distribution and habitat==
It breeds on the Atlantic coast of North America, the Caribbean, and northern South America. Northernmost populations migrate farther south in winter, and this species occurs as a rare vagrant to western Europe. The laughing gull&#x27;s English name is derived from its raucous &quot;kee-agh&quot; call, which sounds like a high-pitched laugh &quot;ha... ha... ha...&quot;.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
Laughing gulls nest from mid to late May in the north of their range and from late April in the south. They nest in colonies which vary in size from a few pairs to 25,000. The nest site is usually on low lying coastal islands. The nest is built by both sexes from available vegetation. The clutch is usually three eggs which are incubated by both parents for 22-27 days. The chicks normally remain near to the nest for the first 5 days. They are fed and brooded by both parents. The young can fly when they are around 40 days old.

<text>Gehry Tower is a nine-story building constructed by architect Frank Gehry; it is located at the &quot;Steintor&quot;, Goethestraße 13a, in Hanover, Germany. The building was commissioned by the city-owned Hanover Transport Services (üstra), for whom Gehry also designed a bus stop in the city.

Constructed of stainless steel, the tower is memorable for the noticeable twist in its outer façade on a ferroconcrete core, making optimal use of the relatively small piece of ground on which it is located. Like many of Gehry&#x27;s buildings, the tower was created with the most modern technology available at the time. Gehry&#x27;s office first created a 1:100 model, which was then scanned and imported into CAD software to be able to compute the dimensions for the individual parts, all of which vary in size and shape.

Construction began in 1999, cost 8.5 million Deutsche Mark, and the building officially opened 28 June 2001.

<doc id="265679" wikidata="Q160260" url="?curid=265679" title="Flag of New Zealand">
<text>The flag of New Zealand (), also known as the New Zealand Ensign, is based on the British maritime Blue Ensigna blue field with the Union Jack in the &quot;canton&quot; or upper hoist corneraugmented or &quot;defaced&quot; with four red stars centred within four white stars, representing the Southern Cross constellation.

New Zealand&#x27;s first internationally accepted national flag, the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand, was adopted in 1834, six years before New Zealand&#x27;s separation from New South Wales and creation as a separate colony following the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. Chosen by an assembly of Māori chiefs at Waitangi in 1834, the flag was of a St George&#x27;s Cross with another cross in the canton containing four stars on a blue field. After the formation of the colony in 1840, British ensigns began to be used. 

The current flag was designed and adopted for use on the colony&#x27;s ships in 1869, was quickly adopted as New Zealand&#x27;s national flag, and given statutory recognition in 1902. Since the 1970s there has been debate about changing the flag. In 2016, a two-stage binding referendum on a flag change took place. Voting in the second stage closed on 24 March, with the country electing to keep the existing flag by 57% to 43%.

==Design==
=== Devices ===
The flag of New Zealand uses two prominent symbols:
* The Union Jack (or Union Flag)
* The Southern Cross (or Crux)

In its original usage as the flag of United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Union Jack combined three heraldic crosses which represent the countries of the United Kingdom (as constituted in 1801):
* The red St George&#x27;s Cross of England
* The white diagonal St Andrew&#x27;s Cross of Scotland
* The red diagonal St Patrick&#x27;s Cross of Ireland

The Union Jack reflects New Zealand&#x27;s origins as a British colony.

The Southern Cross constellation is one of the striking features of the Southern Hemisphere sky, and has been used to represent New Zealand, among other Southern Hemisphere colonies, since the early days of European settlement. Additionally, in Māori mythology the Southern Cross is identified as , an aperture in (the Milky Way) through which storm winds escaped.

===Specifications===
The flag should be rectangular in shape and its length should be two times its width, translating into an aspect ratio of 1:2. It has a royal blue background with a Union Jack in the canton, and four five-pointed red stars centred within four five-pointed white stars on the fly (outer or right-hand side). The exact colours are specified as Pantone 186 C (red), Pantone 280 C (blue), and white. According to the Ministry for Culture and Heritage, the government department responsible for the flag, the royal blue background is &quot;reminiscent of the blue sea and sky surrounding us&quot;, and the stars &quot;signify [New Zealand&#x27;s] place in the South Pacific Ocean&quot;. The New Zealand Government history website states: &quot;Its royal blue background is derived from the ensign of the Blue Squadron of the Royal Navy.&quot;
The notice that appeared in the &quot;New Zealand Gazette&quot; on 27 June 1902 gave a technical description of the stars and their positions on the New Zealand Ensign:

==History==

=== Early flags of New Zealand ===
Māori did not have flags until Europeans introduced them to New Zealand, when they quickly adopted them and made them part of their culture. Some Māori attached traditional woven cloth, such as paki, to their ships when participating in international trade.

The trading ship &quot;Sir George Murray&quot;, built at Horeke in the Hokianga and bought by Thomas McDonnell in 1831, later that year flew a flag of St. George&#x27;s cross with a blue canton charged with a half moon. &quot;The Sydney Herald&quot; called the flag &quot;the New Zealand colours&quot;, but it may have just been McDonnell&#x27;s house flag.

=== Flag of the United Tribes ===

The first flag of New Zealand was adopted 9 (or 20) March 1834 by a vote made by the United Tribes of New Zealand, a meeting of Māori chiefs convened at Waitangi by British resident James Busby. The United Tribes later made the Declaration of Independence of New Zealand at Waitangi in 1835. Three flags were proposed, all designed by the missionary Henry Williams, who was to play a major role in the translation of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. The chiefs rejected two other proposals which included the Union Jack, in favour of a modified St George&#x27;s Cross or the White Ensign, which was the flag used by Henry Williams on the Church Missionary Society ships. This flag became known as the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand and was officially gazetted in New South Wales in August 1835, with a general description not mentioning fimbriation or the number of points on the stars.

The United Tribes&#x27; flag is still flown on the flag pole at Waitangi, and can be seen on Waitangi Day.

===Union Jack===

After the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, the Union Jack was used, although the former United Tribes flag was still used by a number of ships from New Zealand and in many cases on land. The New Zealand Company settlement at Wellington, for example, continued to use the United Tribes flag until Governor William Hobson sent a small armed force to Wellington in May 1840 (following his declaration of British sovereignty). The Union Jack, as a symbol of British authority, became the focus of the Flagstaff War which began in 1844, marking (according to some historians) the start of the New Zealand Wars.

The Union Jack was described as the &quot;superior flag&quot;, to be flown above the New Zealand flag prior to 1965.

===Flags based on defaced Blue Ensign===
During the Invasion of the Waikato (July 1863 – April 1864) period of the New Zealand Wars the British forces realised they needed access to colonial ships to fight Māori. The colonial government subsequently acquired vessels which were staffed by Royal Navy officers. The vessels were under local and not Admiralty control. An armed ship, &quot;Victoria&quot;, owned by the Colony of Victoria transported reinforcements to New Zealand for the campaign and took part in bombardments of Māori. The British government was concerned about its colonies developing their own navies, not under the control of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Admiralty.

This led to the British parliament passing the Colonial Naval Defence Act 1865, which allowed the colonial governments to own ships, including for military purposes, under the provision that they would have to be under the Royal Navy&#x27;s command. In 1866 the British Admiralty advised colonies that if they possessed vessels governed by the Act, they must fly the Royal Navy Blue Ensign but that they must also include on the flag the seal or badge of the colony. New Zealand did not have a colonial badge, or indeed a coat of arms of its own at this stage, and so in 1867 the letters &quot;NZ&quot; were simply added to the blue ensign, following a decree by Governor George Grey on 15 January 1867.
In 1869 the then First Lieutenant of the Royal Navy vessel &quot;Blanche&quot;, Albert Hastings Markham, submitted a design to Sir George Bowen, the Governor of New Zealand, for a national ensign for New Zealand. This followed a request by Bowen to Markham to come up with a new flag design, following a request to Bowen from the Colonial Office. His proposal, incorporating the Southern Cross, was approved on 23 October 1869. It was initially to be used only on government ships.

To end confusion between various designs of the flag, New Zealand&#x27;s Liberal Government passed the New Zealand Ensign Act 1901, which was approved by King Edward VII on 24 March 1902.

=== Flown in battle ===
One of the first recorded accounts of the New Zealand Blue Ensign flag being flown in battle was at Quinn&#x27;s Post, Gallipoli, in 1915. It was not flown officially. The flag was brought back to New Zealand by Private John Taylor, Canterbury Battalion. The first time the flag of New Zealand was flown in a naval battle and the first time officially in any battle, was from HMS &quot;Achilles&quot; during the Battle of the River Plate in 1939.

== Flag law and protocol ==

The Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act 1981 governs the usage of the national flag and all other official flags. This act, like most other laws, can be amended or repealed by a simple majority in Parliament. Section 5(2) of the act declares the flag to be &quot;the symbol of the Realm, Government, and people of New Zealand&quot;. Section 11(1) outlines two offences: altering the flag without lawful authority, and using, displaying, damaging or destroying the flag in or within view of a public place with the intention of dishonouring it.

The minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage has authority to prescribe when and how the flag should be flown and what the standard sizes, dimensions, proportions and colours should be. In its advisory role, the Ministry for Culture and Heritage has issued guidelines to assist persons in their use of the flag. No permission is needed to fly the flag, and it may be flown on every day of the year—government and public buildings with flagpoles are especially encouraged to fly the flag during working hours. However, it should never be flown in a dilapidated condition.

From November 1941 to October 1984 the Ceremony of Honouring the Flag Regulations 1941 required state schools to commemorate Waitangi, Anzac, Empire, King&#x27;s birthday, Trafalgar, Armistice and Dominion Days. In 1984 the cost of flags and poles was estimated to be $340,000.

Unlike some countries there is no single official &quot;Flag Day&quot; in New Zealand. Flag flying may be encouraged on certain commemorative days, at the discretion of the minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage.

The flag is usually only used as a vehicle flag by certain high-ranking officeholders, including: the prime minister and other ministers; ambassadors and high commissioners (when overseas); and the chief of Defence Force. In such cases, no distinguishing defacement or fringing of the flag is used.

The flag is flown at half-mast in New Zealand—always at the discretion of the minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage—to indicate a period of mourning. Notable occasions on which the flag was half-masted include: the death of former prime minister David Lange, the death and state funeral of mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary and the death of Queen Elizabeth II. When the flag is flown at half-mast, it should be lowered to a position recognisably at half-mast to avoid the appearance of a flag which has accidentally fallen away from the top of the flagpole; the flag should be at least its own height from the top of the flagpole.

== Debate ==
With the Union Jack in its upper left-hand quarter, the flag still proclaims New Zealand&#x27;s origins as a British colony. Some New Zealanders believe a new flag would better reflect the country&#x27;s independence, while others argue that the design represents New Zealand&#x27;s strong past and present ties to the United Kingdom and its history as a part of the British Empire. Relatedly, debate about changing the flag has often arisen in connection with the issue of republicanism in New Zealand. The Southern Cross constellation is depicted on other flags, such as the flag of Australia—although in Australia&#x27;s case there are five all-white stars and an additional larger star beneath the Union Jack canton, while New Zealand&#x27;s four stars have red centres. The similar flags of Australia and New Zealand are often mistaken for each other, and this confusion was cited by the NZ Flag.com Trust as a reason for adopting a different design.

Debate on keeping or changing the New Zealand flag started before May 1973, when a remit for &quot;New Zealand to be declared a republic, change the
national flag, and the national anthem&quot; was voted down by the Labour Party at their national conference. In November 1979 Minister of Internal Affairs Allan Highet suggested that the design of the flag should be changed, and sought an artist to design a new flag with a silver fern on the fly, but the proposal attracted little support.

In 1994 Christian Democrat MP Graeme Lee introduced a Flags, Anthems, Emblems, and Names Protection Amendment Bill. If passed, the bill would have entrenched the Act that governs the flag (see ) and added New Zealand&#x27;s anthems, requiring a majority of 65 percent of votes in Parliament before any future legislation could change the flag. The bill passed its first reading but was defeated at its second reading, 26 votes to 37.

In 1998 Prime Minister Jenny Shipley backed Cultural Affairs Minister Marie Hasler&#x27;s call for the flag to be changed. Shipley, along with the New Zealand Tourism Board, put forward the quasi-national silver fern flag (a silver fern on a black field, along the lines of the Canadian Maple Leaf flag) as a possible alternative flag.

On 5 August 2010 Labour list MP Charles Chauvel submitted a member&#x27;s bill for a consultative commission followed by a referendum on the New Zealand flag.

=== 2015–16 referendums ===
On 11 March 2014, Prime Minister John Key announced in a speech his intention to hold a referendum, during the next parliamentary term, on adopting a new flag. Key stated, &quot;It&#x27;s my belief, and I think one increasingly shared by many New Zealanders, that the design of the New Zealand flag symbolises a colonial and post-colonial era whose time has passed&quot;. Following his party&#x27;s re-election that year, the details of the two referendums were announced. The first referendum was set for November 2015 allowing voters to decide on a preferred design from five choices. The second referendum would see the preferred design voted on against the current flag in March 2016.

Had the flag changed, the current flag (described as the &quot;1902 flag&quot;) of New Zealand would have been &quot;recognised as a flag of historical significance&quot;, and its continued use would have been permitted. Official documents depicting the current flag would have been replaced only through ordinary means, e.g. an existing driving licence would have remained valid until its renewal date.

On 11 December 2015, preliminary results were announced for the first referendum. The black, white and blue design, with a silver fern and red stars, was the winning flag. This flag design did not win the second referendum; according to preliminary results announced on 24 March 2016, the existing 1902 flag was chosen to remain the New Zealand flag. 56.7% were in favour of retaining the flag, with a voter turnout of 67.3%. 43.3% were in favour of changing the flag to the Lockwood design.

==New Zealand Red Ensign==
A red version of the flag, officially called the Red Ensign and nicknamed the &quot;red duster&quot;, was adopted in 1903 to be flown on non-government ships. It was flown on New Zealand merchant ships during both world wars.

The Red Ensign has sometimes been flown incorrectly on land in the belief that it is the national flag. The Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act 1981 does allow for the Red Ensign to be used on land on occasions of Māori significance, continuing the long preference of Māori for the use of red in flags.

==Other New Zealand flags==
The flag commonly known as the (te reo Māori for &#x27;absolute sovereignty&#x27;) flag was designed in 1989. It has been acknowledged as a national flag for the Māori.

There are two official flags which, when flown in the appropriate circumstance, take precedence over the national flag of New Zealand:
* The Queen&#x27;s Personal New Zealand Flag, adopted in 1962, depicts the New Zealand coat of arms in banner form defaced with a roundel containing the letter &#x27;E&#x27; and a crown. The personal flag was flown continuously on any building in which Queen Elizabeth II was in residence and by any ship that transported the Queen in New Zealand waters. Since the death of the Queen, the flag is no longer displayed.
* The flag of the governor-general of New Zealand is flown continuously in the presence of the governor-general. The flag in its present form was adopted in 2008, and is a blue banner with a shield of the New Zealand coat of arms surmounted by a crown.

In addition, the New Zealand Police, New Zealand Fire Service, New Zealand Customs Service, and the services of the New Zealand Defence Force have their own flags. A few local authorities have commissioned their own flags, such as that of the City of Nelson.

<text>Van and Schenck were popular American entertainers in the 1910s and 1920s: Gus Van (born August Von Glahn, August 12, 1886 – March 12, 1968), baritone, and Joe Schenck (pronounced &quot;skenk&quot;; born Joseph Thuma Schenck, (June 2, 1891– June 28, 1930), tenor. They were vaudeville stars and made appearances in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1918, 1919, 1920 and 1921. They made numerous phonograph records for the Emerson, Victor, and Columbia record companies.

==History==
With Schenck on piano, the duo sang and performed comedy routines. Van was especially adept at dialect humor, and could imitate any number of regional and continental accents. One of the team&#x27;s typical novelty hits was &quot;Pastafazoola,&quot; in praise of Italian food and sung in the appropriate style. Van&#x27;s hearty baritone and Schenck&#x27;s high tenor harmonized well, and the team became known as &quot;the pennant-winning battery of songland.&quot; They performed on radio shows and appeared in early talking motion pictures, including several musical shorts—in both Vitaphone and MGM Movietone—and one feature, the MGM film &quot;They Learned About Women&quot; (1930).

During World War I, they recorded humorous songs such as &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Get Well&quot; which told the tale of a wounded soldier who did not want to recover, as he was comfortable in hospital and in love with a nurse.

After Schenck&#x27;s death in 1930 of heart disease, Van continued to perform as a solo artist on stage, screen, and radio. He appeared in many New York-produced Soundies in 1941. Schenck was buried in The Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn.

Van and Schenck gained a modern-day resurgence after their 1920 recording of Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;After You Get What You Want, You Don&#x27;t Want It&quot; was sampled in the soundtrack of the indie video game &quot;Pizza Tower&quot;.

<text>The Salicaceae are the willow family of flowering plants. The traditional family (Salicaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot;) included the willows, poplars. Genetic studies summarized by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) have greatly expanded the circumscription of the family to contain 56 genera and about 1220 species, including the tropical Scyphostegiaceae and many of the former Flacourtiaceae.

In the Cronquist system, the Salicaceae were assigned to their own order, Salicales, and contained three genera, &quot;Salix&quot;, &quot;Populus&quot;, and &quot;Chosenia&quot; (now a synonym of &quot;Salix&quot;). Recognized to be closely related to the Violaceae and Passifloraceae, the family is placed by the APG in the order Malpighiales.

Under the new circumscription, most members of the family are trees or shrubs that have simple leaves with alternate arrangement, and temperate members are usually deciduous. Most members have serrate or dentate leaf margins, and many of those that have such toothed margins exhibit salicoid teeth, a salicoid tooth being one in which a vein enters the tooth, expands, and terminates at or near the apex, near which are spherical and glandular protuberances called setae. Sometimes the glands will deflate and appear torus (doughnut) shaped. Some members of the family exhibit violoid or theoid teeth, characters along with presence of an aril and introrse anther dehiscence that are sometimes used to split the family into three families, Salicaceae &quot;sensu medio&quot;, Samydaceae, and Scyphostegiaceae. Members of the family often have flowers which are reduced and inconspicuous, and all have ovaries that are superior or half-inferior with parietal placentation.

==Genera by subfamily and tribe==
Salicaceae are divided into three subfamilies, with Salicoideae further divided into seven tribes. Several of these tribes are not monophyletic and await further revision.

<text>Margaret Youngblood (February 23, 1891 – May 3, 1969) better known by her stage name Margaret Young, was an American singer and comedian who was popular in the 1920s. Young is best known for her songs &quot;Hard Hearted Hannah&quot;, &quot;Lovin&#x27; Sam The Sheik Of Alabam&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Way Down Yonder In New Orleans&quot;, and &quot;Oh By Jingo!&quot;.

== Biography ==
She was born in Detroit, Michigan, on February 23, 1891. She had four sisters; three older and one younger.

Young began her professional career in Detroit, Michigan. She sang at theaters, dinner clubs, and on Vaudeville. Young first recorded commercially for the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1920. She recorded a series of records for Brunswick from 1922 through 1925 which sold well. She continued as a popular entertainer until the end of the decade.

Young came out of retirement to record for Capitol Records in 1949.

Her sister was married to composer Richard A. Whiting, some of whose songs she introduced, and her niece Margaret Whiting also would become a popular singer throughout the 1940s and 1950s.

Young died in Inglewood, California, aged 78 after a brief illness. She was buried next to her late sister, Eleanore (widow of composer Richard Whiting and mother of singer Margaret Whiting) and is interred at the Holy Cross Cemetery in Los Angeles.

<doc id="265697" wikidata="Q3545752" url="?curid=265697" title="University Athletic Association of the Philippines">
<text>The University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP), established in 1938, is an athletic association of eight Metro Manila universities in the Philippines. The eight-member schools are Adamson University (AdU), Ateneo de Manila University, De La Salle University (DLSU), Far Eastern University (FEU), National University (NU), University of the East (UE), University of the Philippines Diliman (UP), and the University of Santo Tomas (UST).

Varsity teams from these universities compete annually in the league&#x27;s 20 sports categories to vie for the overall championship title, namely, 3x3 basketball, athletics, badminton, baseball, basketball, beach volleyball, cheerdance, chess, esports, fencing, football, formation dance, judo, softball, street dance, swimming, table tennis, taekwondo kyorugi &amp; poomsae, tennis, and volleyball.

==History==
In 1924, seeing the need to organize collegiate sports and set general athletic policies, Dr. Regino Ylanan (the University of the Philippines Physical Education Director) met with representatives of Ateneo de Manila, De La Salle College, San Beda College, National University, University of Manila, University of Santo Tomas, and Institute of Accounts (now Far Eastern University) to discuss possibilities of forming an athletic organization, which eventually became the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).

In 1930, the University of the Philippines sponsored an experimental meet of the &quot;Big 3&quot; of the league (NU, UP, UST) on basketball, football, baseball, volleyball, swimming, athletics, boxing, and tennis.

The following year (1931), the NCAA Board of Directors divided the meet into three divisions to put competition on a fairer basis and to stimulate athletics among a greater number.

In March 1932, NU, UP, and UST formally seceded from the NCAA. Led by UP&#x27;s Candido C. Bartolome, NU&#x27;s Leon Tirol and UST&#x27;s Fr. Silvestre Sancho, OP, the move was made to put competitions on equal footing, to increase amateur athletic competitions and to separate the universities from the college members of the league. On April 6, the &quot;Big 3 League&quot; is born. On August 14, the &quot;Big 3&quot; Association is inaugurated with a meet that starts with basketball. Other events were baseball, football, volleyball, relays, athletics, swimming and tennis.

In 1935, UP did not participate in the &quot;Big 3 League&quot; because of mass intramurals at the state university. NU and UST held the meet with FEU (formerly Institute of Accounts) taking UP&#x27;s place.

On September 27, 1938, the University of the Philippines Alumni Association and the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation (PAAF), then the highest sports body in the country, encouraged the original &quot;Big 3 League&quot; and FEU to form a permanent sports association, thus the University Athletic Association of the Philippines was established. Events included were basketball, baseball, football, women&#x27;s volleyball, swimming and athletics. UP bagged three titles (baseball, volleyball, athletics). UST was tops in football and swimming and FEU triumphed in basketball.

In 1941, the outbreak of World War II hindered the staging of the 1941–42 UAAP with UST failing to complete its term. UAAP competition was not held from 1942 to 1946 due to the Japanese occupation of the country which resulted in the closure of educational institutions. The UAAP competition resumed in 1947.
In 1952, University of the East, Adamson University, Manila Central University, and University of Manila were granted two-year probationary membership to the UAAP. After the two-year probationary period, UE and MCU was accepted as a regular member into the league in 1954. MCU remained until its pull-out in 1962. The other two universities (Adamson and UM) were dropped from the UAAP due to their inability to comply with the league requirements. 

In 1970, Adamson University reapplied for admission to the league with a two-year probationary period and in 1974, Adamson successfully hosted the 1974–75 athletic season paving the way for its permanent membership into the league.

In 1978, the UAAP admitted Ateneo de Manila University into the league while De La Salle University joined in 1986.

In 2020, the 2019–20 competition was initially intended to end in May that year. However, the competition abruptly ended early in April due to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the ongoing pandemic, the planned 2020–21 tournament was cancelled, the first in peacetime. The league resumed the tournament on March 26, 2022 with its 84th season.

On August 20, 2024, the UAAP announced a proposal for a new 6,000-capacity indoor arena tentatively named the &quot;Home of the UAAP&quot;. The proposed venue would be located in Pasig and is planned to open in 2027, in time for the association&#x27;s 90th season. The arena will be constructed on a 1.8-hectare site across Bridgetowne Estate, in partnership with Akari Lighting &amp; Technology Corporation.

==Logo==

The previous UAAP logo features the university colors of the eight member-schools of the league in a circular formation. It also bears the year when the league was established, 1938, in the center.

The seal changes every season where the university colors of the season host is placed on the very top. Nonetheless, the arrangement of the colors never changes.

The colors of the National University (blue and gold), Far Eastern University (green and gold), University of Santo Tomas (gold and white), and the University of the Philippines (green and maroon), come first counter-clockwise. These are followed by the colors of the University of the East (red and white), Adamson University (navy blue and white), De La Salle University (green and white), and the Ateneo de Manila University (sky blue and white). The arrangement of the school colors is based from their admission in the UAAP (except for Ateneo de Manila University and De La Salle University&#x27;s colors).

Prior to the start of UAAP Season 84 in March 2022, the league unveiled its new logo on December 17, 2021. The new logo was inspired by the Philippine traditional native sport sipa. Though the school colors arrangement was followed in reverse Season 84 (the season that the UAAP adopted the current logo), the arrangement of school colors still changes every season beginning with Season 85. The host school&#x27;s colors is still placed at the topmost &quot;sipa&quot; streak.

==Member schools==
The following are the member schools of the league:

===Guest schools===
Notes:
In November 2024, the UAAP announced the inclusion of Claret School of Quezon City and PAREF Southridge School as guest teams for the boys&#x27; football tournament.

===Membership timeline===
==Sports==

Member universities compete in 20 sports. Basketball, being the most popular sport in the Philippines, is the most watched and most supported among all the sports. Volleyball and cheerdance are also equally considered marquee events in the UAAP due to growing respective fanbases and media coverage in the country.

All of these sports have Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s divisions, with the exception of baseball, in which only men participate, and softball, which is for women only. The following sports have a high school division, in which the associated high schools of the universities participate: volleyball, table tennis, chess, swimming, fencing, and athletics have Boys&#x27; and Girls&#x27; divisions. Meanwhile, baseball and football have a Boys&#x27; division only. Basketball staged Girls&#x27; division competitions starting Season 82 albeit as demo sport only. Junior High School Basketball was introduced as a demo sport in Season 86. Esports is the latest sport added by the league and was introduced in Season 87.

==Rivalries==
===Ateneo–UP rivalry===
A rivalry between the Ateneo de Manila University and the University of the Philippines, the country&#x27;s two highest-ranked academic institutions for decades, existed even before the formation of the NCAA and UAAP. Students of UP would troop from Padre Faura to the Ateneo campus in Intramuros to play basketball with the Ateneans, which led to Ateneo forming the first organized cheering squad and pep band in the Philippines and what is now known as the Blue Babble Battalion. This would later become UAAP&#x27;s &quot;Battle of Katipunan&quot; when both universities transferred to their respective campuses along Katipunan Avenue in Quezon City, and when the two schools began competing in the UAAP.

While both schools featured in the UAAP championship games for other events like men&#x27;s football, the now-dubbed &quot;Battle of Katipunan&quot; garnered nationwide attention for the first time in UAAP history when third-seeded UP Fighting Maroons, after ending a 21-year long drought of Final Four appearance, overcame second-seeded Adamson Soaring Falcons&#x27; twice-to-beat advantage to advance to the finals for the first time since their 1986 championship to face defending champions Ateneo Blue Eagles in men&#x27;s basketball in 2018. Ateneo won the championship in Season 81 in 2018 via sweep, and Season 85 in 2022 via do-or-die game. The Fighting Maroons ended the Blue Eagles&#x27; all-time UAAP men&#x27;s basketball record 39-game win streak, and won the title via do-or-die game in Season 84 in 2022, before defeating them in the Final Four the following year to end Ateneo&#x27;s six consecutive seasons of UAAP Finals appearances and podium finishes from 2016 to 2022.

===Ateneo–La Salle rivalry===
The rivalry between Ateneo de Manila University and De La Salle University, widely regarded as the Philippines&#x27; foremost collegiate rivalry for decades, has resulted in sold-out games (especially in men&#x27;s basketball and women&#x27;s volleyball, the latter of which both schools hold the current all-time record for the longest joint UAAP Finals appearance from 2012 to 2017) that attract several public figures in attendance, including politicians, movie stars, and foreign diplomats. It is also the foremost school rivalry in the UAAP since La Salle joined the UAAP from the NCAA in 1986. However, the rivalry dates back to the time when both schools were playing in the National Collegiate Athletic Association from 1924 until Ateneo transferred to the UAAP in 1978.

===UP–UST rivalry===
The cheerdance rivalry between University of the Philippines and University of Santo Tomas has been one of the most productive rivalries in any event in UAAP history. Since the inception of the cheerdance, UP and UST possess the best winning records, dominating the top podium finishes between the 1990s and early 2010s, including consecutive joint podium finishes by both schools from 1999 to 2008. Both schools&#x27; pep squads are famous for their stunts and high-energy performances. UST has won eight cheerdance titles which included five straight victories from 2002 to 2006, while UP has won eight cheerdance titles and completed podium finishes for a total of 20 years, the most for the event. Since 2010, the rivalry turned into a friendly one as both UP and UST supporters cheered their school cheers during the announcement of winners.

Although matches between these universities have not reached a rivalry status in sporting events outside of cheerdance, the battle between their respective teams may be referred to as &quot;Separation of Church and State&quot;. UST is the sole pontifical university in the country wherein Pope Pius XII gave it the title &quot;The Catholic University of the Philippines&quot;. UP, on the other hand, has been declared by the Philippine government as the country&#x27;s &quot;national university&quot;.

The popularity of the rivalry between the two universities&#x27; cheerdance teams diminished in the late 2010s as a result of the rise of National University and Adamson University. It gained greater prominence when the two teams competed against each other in the UAAP men&#x27;s basketball semifinals in 2019 and 2024. The Growling Tigers overcame the twice-to-beat Fighting Maroons in the former while the Fighting Maroons posted their first ever head-to-head Final Four-era playoffs victory over the Growling Tigers in the latter to enter the UAAP Finals.

===La Salle–UST rivalry===
Both were known for their numerous basketball championship matches in the 1990s with UST winning four straight titles from 1993 to 1996, the last three of which were at the expense of the Green Archers at the UAAP Finals. In 1997, La Salle eliminated UST in the semifinals to deny the Growling Tigers of a fifth consecutive championship title. In 1999, La Salle defeated the Growling Tigers to win the basketball crown and achieved their own 4-peat championship streak from 1998 to 2001. Their basketball rivalry diminished in latter years because of UST&#x27;s decline.

It became a celebrated rivalry in women&#x27;s volleyball, as the Lady Spikers and the Tigresses met three times in the championship of the Shakey&#x27;s V-League tournament. UST won the first and La Salle winning the latter two. The Tigresses have won five championships while the Lady Spikers have three under their belt.

The women&#x27;s volleyball rivalry was carried over to the UAAP. The DLSU Lady Spikers and the UST Tigresses met in the UAAP Finals for two consecutive seasons – Season 72 (won by UST) and Season 73 (won by La Salle). While UST struggled in the tournament during the mid-2010s, both schools met in the semifinals in Seasons 79 and 85 (won by La Salle), and Seasons 81 and 86 (won by UST). In Season 81, UST ended La Salle&#x27;s decade-long streak of finals appearances (running from 2009 to 2018). It was the longest in the Final Four era of UAAP volleyball.

===FEU–UE rivalry===
The rivalry between Far Eastern University and University of the East started in the 1950s. Tagged as the &quot;Battle of the East&quot;, these two schools, along with UST, have the winningest basketball squads in the league (FEU having won 20 basketball championships while UE having won 18 titles).

===La Salle–FEU rivalry===

The rivalry was sparked after the Season 54 Basketball Finals in 1991 when La Salle&#x27;s final game win was protested by FEU after a Green Archer was admitted into the playing court after being disqualified. The UAAP Board upheld the protest and ordered the replay. The protest was taken up by FIBA, the highest international governing body in basketball. FIBA and the Basketball Association of the Philippines (BAP) supported La Salle&#x27;s stand on the issue. La Salle did not show up, claiming to have won legitimately, and FEU was awarded the trophy by default. La Salle then had their victory parade pass through all UAAP schools – when they passed through the FEU campus, the motorcade was bombarded with debris.

The rivalry between La Salle and FEU has produced several momentous scenes and drama in UAAP Basketball history. FEU and La Salle faced each other in the UAAP Finals in 2004 and 2005, with the Green Archers prevailing in 2004 and FEU winning the year afterwards. However, La Salle&#x27;s 2004 championship was forfeited and handed to the Tamaraws instead after a controversial ineligibility issue, which also caused La Salle&#x27;s suspension in 2006.

La Salle and FEU have met seven times in the finals of UAAP women&#x27;s volleyball, most recently in 2018 when La Salle swept FEU en route to their 11th overall championship. La Salle has won three crowns over FEU in their head-to-head finals matchups, while FEU, having the most number of volleyball championship titles in the country (with a total of 29 titles in the league), has won four crowns over La Salle, most recently in Season 65 (2002). La Salle holds the record of having the longest streaks of appearances in the volleyball tournaments in the UAAP Final Four, ongoing since 2009, and in the UAAP Finals, lasting for 10 consecutive years from 2009 to 2018.

=== Adamson–UP rivalry ===

The rivalry started when Adamson had the twice-to-beat advantage against UP in the UAAP Season 81 men&#x27;s basketball semifinals. During that season, UP and Adamson were the only remaining schools that had yet to compete in the men&#x27;s basketball championship round in the UAAP in the 21st century. After losing twice in the elimination rounds, UP defeated Adamson in two games, including the overtime in the do-or-die match, to pose their first appearance in the UAAP Finals in any of the league&#x27;s marquee events in the 21st century.

===Adamson–Ateneo rivalry===

The Adamson Soaring Falcons and the Ateneo Blue Eagles did not have a well-known rivalry, but Adamson ended a 13-year, 29-match losing streak against Ateneo in the UAAP Season 74 basketball tournaments when they defeated Ateneo in the last game of the elimination round and denied the Blue Eagles of a thrice-to-beat advantage in the semifinals. Their rivalry, also referred to as the &quot;Battle of the Birds&quot;, began in 2010 when they met in the finals of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, a year before Adamson denied Ateneo a sweep of the elimination rounds of the UAAP Season 74 men&#x27;s basketball tournament.

While Adamson and Ateneo&#x27;s UAAP men&#x27;s basketball rivalry was rekindled by their semifinal matchup in UAAP Season 85, both notably competed in the playoffs of women&#x27;s volleyball in UAAP Seasons 75, 76 and 84, with Ateneo prevailing in all mentioned matchups and, in the latter case, ousting Adamson from contention for the Final Four round. In 2023, however, Adamson pulled off an upset by defeating the defending champions, Ateneo, during their matchup in the first round of the eliminations, before facing off against each other in the fourth seed playoff. Ateneo eventually prevailed in the do-or-die playoff to extend their UAAP men&#x27;s basketball semifinals appearance streak to its ninth season. In 2024, Adamson eliminated eighth-seeded Ateneo during the latter&#x27;s weakest tournament performance since clinching the first ever season sweep in the Final Four era of UAAP men&#x27;s basketball in 2019 to force their third consecutive do-or-die playoff for the fourth seed against University of the East, which it eventually won for its recent UAAP men&#x27;s basketball semifinals appearance.

==Media==

===BBC and IBC era (1975–1989)===
The UAAP&#x27;s first media was with the Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) from 1975 to 1984. The Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation (IBC) also had a coinciding deal from 1979 to 1989.

===Silverstar era (1989–1999)===
In 1989, Radio Philippines Network (RPN) began their partnership with the UAAP. Two years later in 1991, Louis Kierulf agreed to a deal with the UAAP to put their entire basketball championship on television through Silverstar Communications. Silverstar would continue broadcasting the UAAP until 1999, during which the broadcasts moved to People&#x27;s Television Network (PTV) in 1994.

===ABS-CBN era (2000–2020)===
In 2000, ABS-CBN, through their sports division, became the UAAP&#x27;s next media partner for the new millennium.

Studio 23 first broadcast the games from 2000 to 2013 before getting replaced by its successor S+A for the rest of the deal. The ABS-CBN also broadcast select games in 2000 and again from 2010 to 2020. Other channels from the network that also broadcast games were Balls (2009–2015) and Liga (2018–2020).

The ABS-CBN deal ended in 2020 as a result of the network&#x27;s shutdown.

===Cignal era (2020–present)===
In search of a new media partner, the association entered a deal with Cignal TV to broadcast games through One Sports. This also included the establishment of the UAAP Varsity Channel, a dedicated channel for the association similar to the Philippine Basketball Association&#x27;s PBA Rush, which is also owned by Cignal.

TV5 also broadcast a selection of games in 2022, while Pilipinas Live serves as the league&#x27;s streaming partner.

<doc id="265702" wikidata="Q45938" url="?curid=265702" title="Auckland Airport">
<text>Auckland Airport is an international airport serving Auckland, the most populous city of New Zealand. It is the largest and busiest airport in the country, with over 16 million passengers served in the year ended August 2023. The airport is located near Māngere, a residential suburb, and Airport Oaks, a service-hub suburb south of the Auckland city centre. It serves as the principal hub for Air New Zealand, and the New Zealand operating base for Jetstar.

The airport is one of New Zealand&#x27;s most important infrastructure assets, providing several thousand jobs for the region. It handled 71 per cent of the country&#x27;s international air passenger arrivals and departures in 2000. It is one of only two commercial airports in New Zealand that can handle Airbus A380 jet aircraft (the other being Christchurch).

The airport has a single runway, 05R/23L, which is Cat IIIb capable (at a reduced rate of movements) in the 23L direction. It has a capacity of about 45 flight movements per hour, and is currently the busiest single-runway airport in Oceania. In November 2007 work began on a new northern runway, to be built in several stages and to be used mainly by smaller aircraft, freeing up capacity on the main runway. The project was delayed several times and as of 2023 no date has been announced for its completion. The airport currently covers 1,500 hectares (5.8 sq. miles) of airport property. 

Currently there are two terminals: International and Domestic. In 2023 the airport announced plans for all jet flights to use a single, expanded terminal, with turboprop flights continuing to use the existing domestic terminal.

==History==
===Overview===
The site of the airport was first used as an airfield by the Auckland Aero Club. In 1928, the club leased some land from a dairy farmer to accommodate the club&#x27;s three De Havilland Gypsy Moths. The club president noted at the time that the site &quot;has many advantages of vital importance for an aerodrome and training ground. It has good approaches, is well drained and is free from power lines, buildings and fogs.&quot; Prior to rebuilding, this was known as Mangere Aerodrome.

From 1948, the RNZAF Base Auckland at Whenuapai served as the civilian airport for Auckland. This was chosen, despite the hills adjacent to Whenuapai limiting the ability of newer aircraft to use the facilities, to the lack of cost to the Auckland City Council, as the site was already established as an RNZAF base. A September 1948 report by Sir Frederick Tymms recommended that Whenuapai Airport be replaced with a larger purpose-built airport located in either Māngere or Pakuranga. In 1958, the New Zealand Government commissioned Leigh Fisher Associates to survey and design the international airport at Māngere.

In 1960 work started to transform the site into Auckland&#x27;s main airport. Much of the runway is on land reclaimed from the Manukau Harbour. The first flight to leave was an Air New Zealand DC-8 in November 1965, bound for Sydney. The airport was officially opened the following year, with a &#x27;grand air pageant&#x27; on Auckland Anniversary weekend, 29 to 31 January 1966.

Upon the airport&#x27;s opening, the runway was long. The runway was extended westward to in 1973.

Qantas commenced the first scheduled Boeing 747 service out of Auckland on Friday 8 December 1972.

A new international terminal, named after Jean Batten, was built in 1977. Prior to this, all flights used what is now the domestic terminal. In 2005, the international terminal was altered, separating arriving and departing passengers.

===Expansion===
Previously taxiway &#x27;Alpha&#x27; (parallel to the main runway) had been modified and designated as Runway 23R/05L so that rehabilitation work could be completed on the main runway 23L/05R. After the work was completed, the temporary runway reverted to taxiway alpha, although the main runway retained its L/R designations. In 2007, construction began on a second runway to the north of the current one. Initially the new runway would have been long and catered for regional flights operated by Air New Zealand using turboprop aircraft. This would have cost $32 million and would have improved the efficiency of the airport by removing smaller planes (which require longer separation distances from the air turbulence wakes of preceding jet airliners) from the main runway. At a later stage, the runway would have been lengthened to to allow it be used by small jets (such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320) on domestic and trans-Tasman flights. In August 2009, however, the project was put on hold due to a downturn in air travel, and later in 2010 the project was suspended.

Construction for Stage One started in November 2007. Stage Two saw the runway being lengthened to , which enabled domestic jet flights to use it. Stage Three (final stage) bought the lengthening of the runway to , allowing medium-sized international jet flights to land there, from destinations such as the Pacific Islands or Australia. Eventually a new domestic terminal would also be built to the north to better utilise the new runway. The new runway will thus free up the longer southern runway to handle more heavy jet operations. The ten-year project would cost NZ$120 million, not including substantial extensions planned for the airport arrivals/departure buildings and associated structures.

In 2009, an extension to the international terminal was constructed, creating Pier B. Pier B covers and has been designed to allow for the addition of new gates when required. It currently has two gates, both capable of handling Airbus A380 aircraft. In May 2009, Emirates became the first airline to fly the A380 to Auckland, using the aircraft on its daily Dubai–Sydney–Auckland route.

On 2 October 2012 Emirates began operating the Dubai–Melbourne–Auckland with an A380, having previously operated the route with a B777-300ER. From 2 October 2013, the A380 took over from a B777-300ER on the Dubai–Brisbane–Auckland route This meant that Emirates would serve Auckland solely with A380s, and Auckland Airport for a period of time was the only airport in the world, other than Dubai, to have four scheduled Emirates A380s on the ground at the same time. In 2014, Singapore Airlines was the second airline to operate A380s at the airport.

In 2013, the domestic terminal undertook a series of upgrades costing a total of $30 million. Stage one ran from January 2013 to March 2013, and involved changes to the drop off points and roads outside the terminal. In the second half of 2013, the baggage claim belts were lengthened, parts of the apron was changed, and new corridors were connected to the jetbridges. The two different sides to the terminals now share a centralised security screening area following the upgrade and an extra storey was added to the western wing to provide an airside connection between the Air New Zealand side of the terminal and the Jetstar side of the terminal. The work took 12 months to complete.

In early 2014, the airport released their 30-year vision for the future, which envisaged the airport to combine both the international and domestic operations into one combined building based around the existing international terminal. This will see new domestic piers built to the south of the existing international precinct within the next 5 years. The plan also allows for the extension of the current international piers and also the creation of new piers for international operations. A new long northern runway will be able to cater for aircraft up to the size of the 777 and 787 jets. New public transport links including a new railway station and line may be built in the future. The plan has been split into four implementation phases. Phase 1 will see all operations combined into one terminal precinct as well as improved road network surrounding the terminal within the next five years. Phase 2 sees the new northern runway constructed as well as the extension of the terminal forecourt by 2025. Phase 3 involves the extension of both international and domestic piers by 2044. Phase 4 sees the northern runway extended to a length of around .

The 2015 Annual Report stated that Pier B would be extended. The extension was completed in 2018, with two new gates (17 and 18) being built. These gates can handle two widebody aircraft or four narrowbody aircraft. 

In March 2023 the airport announced plans to replace the existing domestic terminal. The project is estimated to cost $3.9 billion. The plan is controversial, with airlines expressing concerns at the cost and the resulting increases in landing charges.

==Terminals==

Auckland Airport consists of two terminals; the International Terminal and the Domestic Terminal. The two terminals are located approximately apart and are connected by a free shuttle bus service and a signposted walkway. The airport has 65 gates in total, 23 with jetbridges and 42 remote stands for aircraft parking.

===International terminal===
The international terminal building has three levels, with departures occupying the eastern half of the terminal and arrivals occupying the western half. Departing passengers check-in on the ground floor, then proceed to the first floor though landside retail, immigration and security, and duty-free, before proceeding to the departure gates on the second floor. Arriving passengers arrive on the first floor, passing through duty-free and immigration, before proceeding to the ground floor through baggage claim, customs and biosecurity, and into the arrivals hall.

The terminal has 14 airbridge gates, 10 airbridge gates (1 through 10) and four bus gates (4A through 4D) in Pier A, and four airbridge gates (15 through 18) and four bus gates (16A through 16D) in Pier B. And another gate number 19 is next to 18 it doesn&#x27;t have an airbridge. 

Each international pier feature a tomokanga (Māori carved gateway) in the arrivals area accompanied by a karanga audio recording, symbolising Auckland Airport as a major international gateway and welcoming passengers to New Zealand. The Pier A tomokanga was installed in 1994, while the Pier B tomokanga was installed when the pier opened in 2009.

====Passenger separation====
In 1993, the CAA instituted the requirement that all international airports in New Zealand must keep airside departing and arriving passengers separate. Auckland Airport was granted an exemption to this rule, allowing the airside mingling of arriving and departing passengers to continue, on the basis that all international flights operating into Auckland originated from airports with adequate security screening. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks and further regulation by the ICAO, the CAA required the airport to physically separate arriving and departing passengers by 2006. In the interim period until passenger separation was achieved, flights to the United States as well as all Qantas, and for a short time Cathay Pacific, flights were restricted to departing from gates where a secondary X-ray and metal detector inspection was operating.

To physically separate arriving and departing passengers, Auckland Airport decided to build a new departure level on top of the existing one, with the existing floor becoming the arrivals level. The existing departure lounges were kept by installing glass walls to separate the waiting areas from the newly designed arrivals corridor, and escalators were installed to transport passengers from the new departures level down to each departure lounge. The modifications to the terminal were completed in December 2005, and also involved the expansion of retail space within the pier by and an increase in the number of bus gates to four.

===Domestic terminal===
The two previously separate domestic terminal buildings have now been connected by a common retail area. The Jetstar check-in area is located in the western end of the terminal, in the building previously used by Ansett New Zealand, Qantas, and Pacific Blue. The Air New Zealand check-in area is located in the centre of the terminal. There are nine gates that have jetbridges in the domestic terminal.

Jetstar domestic A320 services operate from gates 20–23 (jetbridge gates). Gate 24 (tarmac gate) is used by both Jetstar and Air New Zealand&#x27;s A320 aircraft. Gates 60–63 were used for Jetstar regional flights, with 62 and 63 being bus gates in a separate building at the Jetstar end of the terminal. Gates 20 and 21 were turned into 60 and 61 during peak regional times. Air New Zealand mainline services operate from gates 24–33. Gates 28 through to 33 all have jetbridges, while gates 25, 26 and 27 don&#x27;t exist. Air New Zealand turboprop services operate from the regional section of the domestic terminal, along with Barrier Air and Air Chathams. This is located at the eastern end of the terminal and consists of gates 34–50 (excluding gate numbers 37, 38 and 44, which do not exist).

===Shareholders===
Auckland International Airport Limited (AIAL) was formed in 1988, when the New Zealand Government corporatised the airport. It had previously been run by the Auckland Regional Authority, covering the five councils in the Auckland region.

The Government was AIAL&#x27;s majority shareholder, the rest being held by the local councils. In 1998 the Government sold its shareholding, and AIAL became the fifth airport company in the world to be publicly listed. At that time the major shareholders were Auckland City Council (25.8 per cent), Manukau City Council (9.6 per cent) and North Shore City Council (7.1 per cent). North Shore City Council sold its shares in 1999 and Auckland City Council sold its share down to 12.8 per cent in 2002. After amalgamation into the Auckland Council, the local authority owned a 22.4 per cent stake worth $1.13 billion as of May 2014. As of 2024, Auckland Council has a 11.1% stake. 

AIAL appears on the New Zealand Stock Exchange () and Australian Stock Exchange (). International shareholders hold around 40 per cent of the shares, domestic approximately 60 per cent. The company has a Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s credit rating of A+/Stable/A-1.

As at 31 December 2015, Auckland Airport was the biggest listed company on the NZX, with a market capitalisation of $6.85 Billion NZD.

=== Revenue ===

AIAL enjoys diverse revenue streams, and operates a &#x27;dual-till&#x27; approach, whereby its finances are split into aeronautical and non-aeronautical balance sheets. Aeronautical income is derived from airfield charges, terminal services charge and the airport development charge (or departure fee). Non-aeronautical revenue comes from its significant property portfolio, car park, and retail income. Due to the airport having little-to-no competition, the aeronautical side of the business is subject to information disclosure requirements as set by the Commerce Commission. Income from the non-aeronautical side of the business accounts for just over half of its revenue. The airport has been criticised by airlines, led by Air New Zealand, for its purportedly high landing charges. Research conducted in September 2010 by aviation consultants Jacobs, however, indicates that Auckland Airport international charges are slightly below the average of the 20 largest international airports flown by Air New Zealand.

The diversity in revenue was of benefit during the downturn in international aviation following the events of 11 September 2001, and subsequently the 2002 Bali bombings, SARS outbreak and the Iraq War. The airport was able to rely on steady income from the non-aeronautical side of the business, which softened the blow of international events.

In July 2009 Auckland Airport elected to delay a scheduled increase in its landing charges from 1 July 2009 to assist its airline customers during the recession. The scheduled increase was put in place on 1 March 2010. The company has in the past reportedly been singled out by airline lobby group IATA for its consistent excessive level of profits. Airlines such as Air New Zealand complain of excessive landing charges. On 5 June 2007, the airport&#x27;s 60 per cent profit margin was criticised by IATA director general and CEO Giovanni Bisignani. He said the airport had a &quot;happy monopoly&quot; and that IATA would ask the New Zealand government to investigate.

Until July 2008, AIAL charged all departing international passengers (12 years old or older) a $25 departure fee. This has been replaced with a passenger services charge levied on the airlines for each arriving and departing international passenger. This charge has commenced at $13 and was planned to rise by 50 cents a year for two years to $14.
In 2012, Auckland Airport envisaged to cut the international passenger fee and hike the domestic travellers charges in FY-2013.

===Partnership with Queenstown Airport===
On 8 July 2010, AIAL announced it had entered into an agreement to take a 24.99 per cent shareholding in Queenstown Airport Corporation Limited, the operator of Queenstown Airport, and form a strategic alliance between the two airports. The shareholding will cost NZ$27.7 million, through the issue of new shares. The alliance is expected to generate an extra 176,000 passengers through Queenstown Airport. AIAL has an option to increase its shareholding in Queenstown Airport to 30–35 per cent at any time up to 30 June 2011, subject to the approval of the Queenstown Lakes District Council. The new share capital from would allow Queenstown Airport to fund growth of the airport&#x27;s operating capacity and to pay regular dividends back to the community via the Queenstown Lakes District Council shareholding.

===Radio===
Auckland Airport owned radio frequencies over a 15-year period. It purchased the Radio Hauraki frequency 1476 AM in 1990, and began operating adult contemporary and flight information radio station Info Music from the domestic terminal. It purchased 1XD Counties Manukau L Double L and its 1404 AM, 1548 AM and 702 AM frequencies in 1992, and changed the station name to Info Music Counties 1476 and then Airport Radio AKL1476. The 1476 frequency was leased to Independent Broadcasting Company in 1993, which used it at various times for Auckland 1476, The Breeze on 91, Lifestyle Radio, and Today 99.8FM. It was leased to talkback station The Point 1XD in 1994, and made available to Auckland Radio Trust to rebroadcast the BBC World Service in 1998. It was sold in 2005.

==Ground transportation==

===Road===
Two state highways connect to the airport; State Highway 20A and State Highway 20B. State Highway 20A leaves the airport to the north along George Bolt Memorial Drive and travels through Māngere as an expressway before joining State Highway 20. State Highway 20B leaves the airport to the east and crosses Pukaki Creek before travelling along Puhinui Road to an interchange with State Highway 20 in Wiri.

===Public transport===
* SkyDrive express buses operate between both terminals at the airport and SkyCity in central Auckland.
* The Airport Link is a Bus Rapid Transit-lite service that connects the airport to Puhinui Railway Station. This service is the first stage of an eventual full BRT line from the Airport to Botany Town Centre
* Park &amp; Ride bus service is available for short-term and long-term parking. It is located 10 – 15 minutes from the domestic and international terminals. The park and ride service is also used by the majority of airport staff. 

====Rail proposals====

A heavy rail connection from the airport to Auckland CBD was initially conceived as an extension of the Onehunga Branch line via Māngere Bridge and the suburb of Māngere. Another proposal was the construction of a heavy rail line to the east of the airport to connect with the North Island Main Trunk line near Puhinui Station, or the creation of a loop to connect the airport to both the Onehunga Line and the North Island Main Trunk Line.

The preferred option between 2016 and 2024 was an entirely new light rail line running from the airport to central Auckland via a direct alignment through Mangere, Onehunga and Mount Roskill. At Mount Roskill, it would have connected to the planned Dominion Road light rail line which would have continued on to Queen Street in Central Auckland before reaching a final terminus in the Wynyard Quarter waterfront development area. This project was cancelled by the new National government in January 2024.

===Cycling===
There are several cycle routes connecting the airport to the surrounding suburbs, consisting of both off-road tracks and on-road cycle lanes.

==Accidents and incidents==
Accidents and incidents that occurred at or near Auckland Airport include:
*4 July 1966 – an Air New Zealand Douglas DC-8 on a training flight crashed on the runway shortly after taking off, killing 2 of the 5 crew (no passengers were on board).
*17 February 1979 – Air New Zealand Flight 4374 crashed into Manukau Harbour while on final approach. 1 crew and 1 company staff member were killed.
*31 July 1989 – an Air Freight NZ Convair 340/580 crashed shortly after taking off at night. All 3 crew members were killed.
*12 March 2003 - Singapore Airlines flight 286, a Boeing 747-412, suffered a long tail strike during takeoff. A transcription error saw the takeoff thrust and speeds calculated on a weight 100 tonnes less than the actual weight.

<text>Ian Roderick MacLeod (born 6 August 1956) is a British science fiction and fantasy writer.

He was born in Solihull near Birmingham. He studied law and worked as a civil servant before going freelance in early 1990s soon after he started publishing stories, attracting critical praise and awards.

==Writings==
He is the author of seven novels, including &quot;The Light Ages&quot; and &quot;The House of Storms&quot;, which are set in an alternate universe nineteenth century England, where aether, a substance that can be controlled by the mind, has ossified English society into guilds and has retarded technological progress. His other novels and short stories feature a mixture of fantastic, historical, and futuristic elements, combined with a concern for character and vividly descriptive writing. His novel &quot;Song of Time&quot;, told from a viewpoint of a classical violinist and set in the near future, won the Arthur C. Clarke Award, the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel and the Premio Italia Award for Best International SF Novel in 2023. His novel &quot;Wake Up and Dream&quot;, set in an alternative 1940s Los Angeles, won a Sidewise Award for Best Alternative History. His novel &quot;Red Snow&quot; follows the path of a vampire across several centuries in Europe and the United States.

MacLeod&#x27;s novella &quot;The Summer Isles&quot; (&quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot; October/November 1998) won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History, Short Form and the World Fantasy Award for Best Novella. It is an alternate history where Britain, having been defeated in the World War I, develops its own form of fascism in 1930s. The narrator is a closeted homosexual Oxford historian who had known the leader in youth. It was written as a novel, which however could not sell; MacLeod published the cut version, with the full-length version only being published in a limited edition in 2005. This novel version also won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History, Long Form, thus becoming the only story to win the same award twice in two differing formats, novel and novella.

MacLeod won the World Fantasy Award again in for his 2000 novelette &quot;The Chop Girl&quot;. His shorter fiction has been collected in &quot;Voyages by Starlight&quot;, &quot;Breathmoss and Other Exhalations,&quot; &quot;Past Magic, Journeys,&quot; &quot;Frost on Glass&quot; and &quot;Ragged Maps.&quot;

MacLeod was Guest of Honour at the 38th Novacon, held in November 2008.

<doc id="265708" wikidata="Q535770" url="?curid=265708" title="Judiciary of Germany">
<text>The judiciary of Germany is the system of courts that interprets and applies the law in Germany.

The German legal system is a civil law mostly based on a comprehensive compendium of statutes, as compared to the common law systems. In criminal and administrative law, Germany uses an inquisitorial system where the judges are actively involved in investigating the facts of the case, as compared to an adversarial system where the role of the judge is primarily that of an impartial referee between the prosecutor or plaintiff and the defendant or defense counsel.

In Germany, the independence of the judiciary is historically older than democracy. The organisation of courts is traditionally strong, and almost all federal and state actions are subject to judicial review.

Judges follow a distinct career path. At the end of their legal education at university, all law students must pass a state examination before they can continue on to an apprenticeship that provides them with broad training in the legal profession over two years. They then must pass a second state examination that qualifies them to practice law. At that point, the individual can choose either to be a lawyer or to enter the judiciary. Judicial candidates start working at courts immediately. However, they are subjected to a probationary period of up to five years before being appointed as judges for life.

The judicial system is established and governed by part IX of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany. Article 92 of the Basic Law establishes the courts, and states that &quot;the judicial power shall be vested in the judges; it shall be exercised by the Federal Constitutional Court, by the federal courts provided for in this Basic Law, and by the courts of the Länder.&quot;

==History==
Germany used jury trials from the Middle Ages onwards, for example in the . The jury system was implemented in the German Empire by the Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz (GVG) of 27 January 1877 with the jury court (&quot;&quot;) consisting of 3 judges and 12 jurymen. During a state of emergency under Article 48 (of the Weimar Constitution), and about one month before the trial of Adolf Hitler February 1924 for the Beer Hall Putsch of November 1923, the Emminger Reform (a , or emergency decree) was passed in January 1924 abolishing juries and replacing them with the mixed system of judges and lay judges that is still used today.

==Law==
Germany&#x27;s legal system is a civilian system whose highest source of law is the 1949 Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany (which serves as the nation&#x27;s constitution), which sets up the modern judiciary, but the law adjudicated in court comes from the German Codes; thus, German law is primarily codal in nature. The court system adjudicates (1) public law (&#x27;), that is, administrative law (civil-government litigation or litigation between two government bodies) and criminal law, and (2) private law (&#x27;). German law—especially private law—is mainly based on early Byzantine law, specifically Justinian&#x27;s Code, and to a much lesser extent the Napoleonic Code.

German law is not impregnated with legal positivism to the extent of Napoleonic legal systems, so Germany&#x27;s judiciary is not subordinated to the legislature; the Basic Law directly invests supreme judicial power in the Constitutional Court as well as other federal courts and the courts of each Länder, and case law has greater importance, though not to the extent of common law systems.

In contrast to the adversarial system used by common law countries, the German system of criminal (and administrative) procedure is inquisitorial. Rather than allowing cross-examination between the defense and prosecutors, the judges conduct the majority of the trial. During a trial, the parties are expected to give all their evidence to the judges, who will then call forward and question the witnesses, after which the defense counsel and prosecutor may question the witnesses.

==Courts==
The primary legislation concerning court organization is the Courts Constitution Act (&#x27;, or &#x27;). The courts are characterized by being specialist, regional, and hierarchically integrated at the federal level. There are five basic types of courts, plus the Federal Constitutional Court and the Länder&#x27;s constitutional courts:

* Ordinary courts, dealing with criminal and most civil cases
* Administrative law courts
* Tax law courts
* Labour law courts
* Social law courts
* Constitutional law courts, focusing on judicial review and constitutional interpretation

The main difference between the Federal Constitutional Court and the Federal Court is that the Federal Constitutional Court may only be called if a constitutional matter within a case is in question (e.g., a possible violation of human rights in a criminal trial), while the Federal Court of Justice may be called in any case. Only the Constitutional Court can declare an Act of Parliament invalid.

Ordinary courts are the most numerous by far. Currently there are 828 ordinary courts (687 local, 116 regional, 24 appellate, one federal), 142 labour courts (122 local, 19 appellate, one federal), 69 administrative courts (52 local, 16 higher, one federal), 20 tax courts (19 local, one federal), 86 social courts (69 local, 16 appellate, one federal) and 17 constitutional courts (16 State Constitutional Courts, one Federal Constitutional Court).

More recently, specialized commercial courts have been created. In January of 2018, the Chamber for International Commercial Disputes of the Landgericht Frankfurt am Main was established. There is also the Commercial Court based in Stuttgart and Mannheim specializing in major commercial and international disputes.

===Ordinary courts===
Trial courts in criminal matters are composed of:

The appellate courts in criminal matters are composed of:
For a comparison of the relative activity of the ordinary courts, in 1969 there were 468,273 criminal cases in Germany, and 388,619 or 83% of these were held in the &quot;Amtsgericht&quot; composed of a single judge.

===Specialized courts===
Specialized courts deal with five distinct subject areas: administrative, labour, social, fiscal, and patent law. Like the ordinary courts, they are organized hierarchically with the state court systems under a federal appeals court.

* Administrative law courts (&#x27;) consist of local administrative courts, higher administrative courts, and the Federal Administrative Court. In these courts, individuals can have wrongful administrative acts overturned. For instance, many lawsuits have been brought in administrative courts by citizens against the government concerning the location and safety standards of nuclear power plants. They also decide certain disputes between governmental institutions, eg between a municipality and a state agency or between mayor and council of a municipality. The Federal Administrative Court (&#x27;) is the highest administrative law court.
* Labour law courts (&#x27;) also function on three levels and address disputes over collective bargaining agreements and working conditions. The Federal Labour Court (&#x27;) is the highest labour law court.
* Social law courts (&#x27;), organized at three levels, adjudicate cases relating to the system of social insurance, which includes unemployment compensation, workers&#x27; compensation, and social security payments. They are also responsible for several other cases on social security law, like support for disabled persons or victims of crimes. The Federal Social Court (&#x27;) is the highest social law court.
* Fiscal Courts (&#x27;), also called tax law courts or finance courts, hear tax-related cases and have only a two-tier structure. The Federal Fiscal Court (&#x27;) is the highest tax law court and hears appeals against the decisions of the Fiscal Courts.
* The Federal Patent Court hears certain intellectual property cases on patents, utility rights and trademarks. In patent, utility rights and trademark matters there is a bifurcation of judiciary responsibilities in Germany between the Federal Patent Court and the various German Regional Courts. This bifurcated court system has a long tradition in Germany and is based on the notion that decisions of the Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt (German Patent and Trademark Office) shall be checked by a particular court created for that purpose, namely, the Federal Patent Court in Munich. Court of appeals is in all cases the (ordinary) Federal Court of Justice of Germany.

===Constitutional courts===

====State====
Each one of the Länder has its own state constitutional court (see e.g. the Constitutional Court of the State of Berlin or the Constitutional Court of Saxony). These courts are administratively independent and financially autonomous from any other government body. For instance, a state constitutional court can write its own budget and hire or fire employees, powers that represent a degree of independence unique in the government structure. The courts of each state are also directly authorized by the Basic Law for the Federal Republic.

====Federal====
The Federal Constitutional Court (&#x27;, or &#x27;) is the supreme constitutional court established by the constitution or Basic Law of Germany. Since its inception with the beginning of the Federal Republic of Germany, the court has been located in the city of Karlsruheintentionally in a certain geographical distance from the other federal institutions in Berlin (earlier in Bonn), Munich, and Frankfurt.

The sole task of the court is judicial review, and it may declare any federal or state legislation unconstitutional, thus rendering them ineffective. In this respect, it is similar to other supreme courts with judicial review powers, like the Supreme Court of the United States; yet the Court possesses a number of additional powers, and is regarded as among the most interventionist and powerful national courts in the world. Unlike other supreme courts, the constitutional court is not an integral stage of the judicial or appeals process (aside from in cases concerning constitutional or public international law), and does not serve as a regular appellate court from lower courts or the Federal Supreme Courts on any violation of federal laws.

The court&#x27;s jurisdiction is focused on constitutional issues and the compliance of all governmental institution with the constitution. Constitutional amendments or changes passed by the Parliament are subject to its judicial review, since they have to be compatible with the most basic principles of the &quot;&quot; (per the &quot;eternity clause&quot;), those being the principles of human dignity, unalienable human rights, democracy, republicanism, social responsibility, federalism and separation of powers.

The court&#x27;s practice of enormous constitutional control frequency on the one hand, and the continuity in judicial restraint and political revision on the other hand, have created a unique defender of the &quot; since World War II and given it a valuable role in Germany&#x27;s modern democracy.

==Personnel==

===Professional judges===
The federal courts are administered by the federal government; all the other courts belong to a state and are administered by it. The independence of the judiciary that is laid down in the federal constitution (article 97 para. 1) only refers to the judicial decision-making process of any individual judge, not to the judicial power as a whole. In line with this, the courts are administrative bodies subordinate to the respective department of justice, special rules only applying to the judicial decision-making process and the status of the judges.

All professional judges are members of a common corps in that they are recruited through a common process and their career is governed largely by federal law. However, most judges are state (&quot;) civil servants and follow state rules on legal education, appointment, and promotion.

====State====
As a rule, each decision on the initial employment, vesting with lifetime tenure or promotion of a judge is taken by the department of justice. Yet in some of the states there is some kind of a parliamentary body that needs to be heard or even has a say in some of the decisions on careers of individual judges (&quot;Richterwahlausschuss&quot;). The mostly decisive influence of the administration on the career of judges is exceptional in continental Europe, where mostly bodies of judges, elected by and within the judiciary take this kind of decision (e.g., France: &quot;conseil superieur de la magistrature&quot;, Italy: &quot;consiglio superiore della magistratura&quot;). By some it is regarded as a threat to judicial independence that with a view to their personal career judges might be inclined to specially regard possible political effects of their decisions or may choose to support a political party.

====Federal====
Federal judges are picked in an procedure by a body composed of a Minister of the federal state, federal MPs and ministers of the states (article 95 para. 2 of the federal constitution). Candidates do not have to be professional judges, but must be lawyers. There are neither public hearings, nor would the identity of any candidate even be disclosed to the public. Judicial members of the federal constitutional court are elected in turns by the federal chambers (article 94 of the federal constitution). This decision requiring a large majority, it usually follows a political compromise. Public discussion about candidates is very unusual.

===Lay judges===
Lay judges are ordinary members of the public selected for this role by a special committee, at the suggestion of a municipal council, for a five-year term. Lay judges must be German citizens who have neither been convicted of nor are under investigation for any serious crime. In addition, certain groups of individuals shall not be chosen as lay judges, such as people under the age of 25 or over the age of 69, or individuals working in the court system in a professional capacity (such as lawyers and judges). In addition, individuals over the age of 65 may refuse to serve, as may, for instance, members of federal or state legislatures, doctors, nurses, and those who have served as lay judges in the preceding term. Applications to become lay judges can be made by interested citizens and local governments will typically encourage applications before a new term begins. Welfare institutions, sports clubs, financial and health insurance institutions, trade unions, industrial companies and other public authorities are sometimes called upon to nominate candidates.

Except for most crimes for which the trier of fact is a single professional judge and serious political crimes which are tried before a panel of professional judges, all charges are tried before mixed tribunals on which lay judges sit alongside professional judges. The German Code of Criminal Procedure requires a two-thirds majority for most decisions unfavorable to the defendant; denial of probation by simple majority is an important exception. In most cases, lay judges do not have access to the case file.

The lay judges needed to staff the various tribunals are selected by a selection committee from lists that are passed by the municipal councils () with a two-thirds majority of attending local councillors. Given the high threshold for inclusion on the municipal council lists, in practice these lists are first compiled by municipal bureaucracies and the political parties in Germany, but some municipal councils rely on registers of residents and generate names randomly. The selection committee consists of a judge from the , a representative of the state government, and ten &quot;trusted citizens&quot; (, ) who are also elected by two thirds of the municipal council.

Lay judges have historically been predominantly middle-aged men from middle-class backgrounds; more recently, the share of male and female judges was about the same. A study conducted in 1969 found that, of the lay judges in its sample, approximately 25% were civil service employees, compared to only about 12% from blue-collar backgrounds. A study published in 2009 put the proportions at 27% civil service employees versus 8% of the general population and noted the relatively high numbers of housewives, the relatively low number of private sector employees, and the relative old age of lay judges.

===Prosecutors===
Public prosecutors, who earn as much as judges, are nonetheless simple ordinary servants lacking the independence of the Bench.

The switching between prosecutorial office and the bench is not only accepted but encouraged so as to allow for the greatest amount of experience.

===Attorneys===
A lawyer can only qualify as a defense attorney if they fulfill/possess the so-called . This translates literally as &quot;aptitude to be a judge&quot;; however, the basic meaning is to have successfully completed a study of law at roughly a master&#x27;s degree level, being finally examined by the state itself (), and to have served for two years as an associate to different lawyers from each of their most popular occupations (attorney, judge, administrative official, etc.; this is called the ). However, to actually become a judge, besides the the expectations include outstanding results in the respective exams, which is not expected for attorneys (but, roughly, is expected for prosecutors and administrative officials).

Defense attorneys are grouped into divisions of their local or state bar associations in which membership is mandatory.

==Sentencing practices==
If a defendant is convicted, the court will usually credit the period of pre-trial confinement as part of the sentence. Sentences can range from one month to life, and typically do not exceed 15 years. Defendants sentenced to life in prison can typically apply for parole after 15 years, and if the application is rejected, the defendant can re-apply after a set period no longer than two years. If the court determines that there is a &quot;severe gravity of guilt&quot;, parole can be delayed for a non-specific period beyond 15 years.

In addition to reducing an offender&#x27;s sentence, Germany&#x27;s corrections system has a form of punishment called suspended sentencing. Depending on the crime, some sentences can take away jail or prison time and replace it with probation. If a person is convicted of a crime, they can be put on a probationary sentence where they do not have to go to prison if &quot;the person sentenced should demonstrate that being sentenced was itself sufficient warning that he will not commit any further crimes&quot;. Despite having to be put under &quot;supervision of a probation officer&quot;, the person is able to avoid the negative aspects of prison such as being &quot;torn away from his previous life, work, and social contracts&quot;. Sentences of six months or less are automatically suspended by the court as well as those sentences between six months to a year unless it is &quot;necessary for the person to serve the sentence to preserve legal order&quot;. After an offender serves two thirds of their prison sentence, it is possible to have their sentence suspended. The process for having a sentence suspended after serving time is the same as applying for parole. It is also possible for offenders serving life sentences to receive a suspended sentence after serving at least fifteen years. Just like any other probation sentence, if the offender breaks their probation or commits another crime, they can have their freedom revoked and be sent back to prison.

==Analysis and criticism==
Selection of lay judges has been described as a &quot;highly political and discriminatory process&quot;. It has been argued that personal acquaintance, political affiliation and occupation have all historically played an important, if publicly unacknowledged, role in the selection procedure.

<text>Sir Harold Delf Gillies (17 June 1882 – 10 September 1960) was a New Zealand otolaryngologist and father of modern plastic surgery for the techniques he devised to repair the faces of soldiers coming back from the trenches.

==Early life==

Gillies was born in Dunedin, New Zealand, the son of Member of Parliament in Otago, Robert Gillies. He attended Whanganui Collegiate School and studied medicine at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where despite a stiff elbow sustained sliding down the banisters at home as a child, he was an excellent sportsman. He was a golf blue in 1903, 1904 and 1905 and also a rowing blue, competing in the 1904 Boat Race. In 1910, he acquired a position working as an ENT specialist for Sir Milsom Rees&#x27; medical practice. At Caius he became a freemason and rose to be Master of Caius Lodge. Gillies was a student at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital and won the Luther Holden Research Scholarship in 1910. He was also Lecturer on Plastic Surgery in that medical school.

==Career==

=== World War I ===

Following the outbreak of World War I he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps. Initially posted to Wimereux, near Boulogne, he acted as medical minder to a French-American dentist, Auguste Charles Valadier, who was not allowed to operate unsupervised but was attempting to develop jaw repair work. Gillies, eager after seeing Valadier experimenting with nascent skin graft techniques, then decided to leave for Paris, to meet the renowned oral surgeon Hippolyte Morestin. He saw him remove a tumour on a patient&#x27;s face, and cover it with jaw skin taken from the patient. Gillies became enthusiastic about the work and on his return to England persuaded the army&#x27;s chief surgeon, William Arbuthnot-Lane, that a facial injury ward should be established at the Cambridge Military Hospital, Aldershot.

The ward rapidly proved inadequate for the increasingly large number of patients in need of treatment, and a new hospital devoted to facial repairs was developed at Sidcup. The Queen&#x27;s Hospital opened in June 1917, and with its convalescent units provided over 1,000 beds. There, Gillies and his colleagues developed many innovative plastic surgery techniques; more than 11,000 operations were performed on over 5,000 men. The hospital, later to become Queen Mary&#x27;s Hospital, was at Frognal House (the birthplace and property of Thomas Townshend, Lord Sydney after whom Sydney, Australia, was named).

For his war services Gillies was knighted in the 1930 Birthday Honours. Sir William Arbuthnot Lane, 1st Baronet, commented, &quot;Better late than never&quot;.

===Private practice===

Between the wars Gillies developed a substantial private practice with Rainsford Mowlem, including many famous patients, and travelled extensively, lecturing, teaching and promoting the most advanced techniques worldwide.

In 1930 Gillies invited his cousin, Archibald McIndoe, to join the practice, and also suggested he apply for a post at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital. This was the point at which McIndoe became committed to plastic surgery, in which he too became pre-eminent.

===World War II===
During World War II Gillies acted as a consultant to the Ministry of Health, the RAF and the Admiralty. He organised plastic surgery units in various parts of Britain and inspired colleagues to do the same, including pioneering plastic surgeon Stewart Harrison who founded the plastic surgery unit at Wexham Park Hospital, Berkshire. His own work continued at Rooksdown House, part of the Park Prewett Hospital, Basingstoke. During this period, and after the war, he trained many doctors from Commonwealth nations in plastic surgery.

===Pioneering gender-affirming surgery===
Instead of retiring at the end of the Second World War Gillies had to keep working as he had insufficient savings.

In 1946, he and a colleague carried out one of the first gender-affirming surgery from female to male on Michael Dillon. In 1951 he and colleagues carried out one of the first modern gender-affirming surgeries, from male to female, on Roberta Cowell, using a flap technique, which became the standard for 40 years.

Gillies made a visit to New Zealand in 1956 after an absence of 51 years.

On his work for Cowell and Dillon, Gillies remarked: “If it gives real happiness, that is the most that any surgeon or medicine can give.”

==Death==
Gillies suffered a slight cerebral thrombosis at the age of 78 while undertaking a major operation on the damaged leg of an 18-year-old girl on 3 August 1960.

Gillies died on 10 September 1960 at The London Clinic, at 20 Devonshire Place, Marylebone. Despite earning an estimated £30,000 per year between the First and Second World Wars he left an estate of only £21,161.

==Personal life==
Gillies married Kathleen Margaret Jackson on 9 November 1911, in London. They had four children. His eldest son, John Gillies, flew Spitfires with No. 92 Squadron RAF in World War II. John was shot down over France on 23 May 1940, and became a POW for the duration of the war. Harold&#x27;s youngest son Michael Thomas Gillies followed his father into medicine. Actor Daniel Gillies is his descendant.

Gillies was an amateur golfer. He played in the Amateur Championship every year from 1906 to 1931 and represented England in their annual match against Scotland in 1908, 1925, 1926 and 1927. He won the 1913 St. George&#x27;s Grand Challenge Cup and was runner-up in the 1914 Golf Illustrated Gold Vase, behind Harold Hilton. He won the President&#x27;s Putter in 1925. His older brother Charles won the 1899 Australian Amateur.

For many years his home was at 71 Frognal, Hampstead, London. A blue plaque on the front of that house now commemorates his life and work. In Cambridge, in 2015, Gonville and Caius College built twelve houses and named the road &quot;Gillies Close&quot; (postcode CB5 8ZD) in his honour. Gillies Lane at Gun Hill Park in Aldershot, the former Cambridge Military Hospital, similarly commemorates him.

<doc id="265713" wikidata="Q168057" url="?curid=265713" title="Craiova">
<text>Craiova (, , ) is the largest city in southwestern Romania, the seventh largest city in the country and the capital of Dolj County, situated near the east bank of the river Jiu in central Oltenia. 

It is a longstanding political center, and is located at approximately equal distances from the Southern Carpathians (north) and the River Danube (south). Craiova is the chief commercial city west of Bucharest and the most important city of Oltenia. The city prospered as a regional trading centre despite an earthquake in 1790, a plague in 1795, and a Turkish assault in 1802 during which it was burned.

Eight villages are administered by the city: Făcăi, Mofleni, Popoveni, Șimnicu de Jos, Cernele, Cernelele de Sus, Izvoru Rece, and Rovine. The last four were a separate commune called &quot;Cernele&quot; until 1996, when they were merged into the city.

==Etymology and names==
There are two possible etymologies for Craiova: Old Slavonic &quot;&quot; (&quot;king&quot;), which has been borrowed in Romania as &quot;&quot;, and Slavonic &quot;krajina&quot; (&quot;border&quot; or &quot;edge&quot;). Since no source prior to 1475 mentions the city, it is impossible to tell which of the two words is the real etymology. 

In Hungarian, the town is either referred to as , a remnant of the city&#x27;s Hungarian rule during the Árpád dynasty, or as . The German name of the city is .

==History==
Craiova, which occupied the site of the Dacian and Roman city &quot;Pelendava&quot;, was formerly the capital of Oltenia. Its ancient &quot;bans&quot;, the highest ranking boyars of the Wallachian state, were initially those of the Craiovești family. The &quot;bans&quot; had the right of minting coins stamped with their own effigies – the origin of the Romanian word &quot;ban&quot; as used for coins.
The economic power of the Craiovești family at the end of the 16th century was about 100 villages (182 financial goods). This power gave them a statute of political autonomy so big, that the hospodars ruling at that time were not able to keep in power without an alliance with this powerful dynasty. From the Craiovești family there were chosen a lot of hospodars to rule the country: Neagoe Basarab, Radu de la Afumați, Radu Șerban (1602–1611), Matei Basarab, Constantin Șerban, Șerban Cantacuzino, Constantin Brâncoveanu.

In 1395 Craiova was probably the scene of a victory won by the Wallachian Prince Mircea I of Wallachia over Bayezid I, Sultan of the Ottomans (&quot;see Battle of Rovine&quot;). 

Frequently referred to as &quot;a city&quot; after the first half of the 16th century, the Craiova area was always regarded as an important economic region of Wallachia and Romania at large. During the 1718–1739 Habsburg occupation of Oltenia (see Banat of Craiova), Craiova&#x27;s status declined due to economic pressures and increased centralism, partly leading to an increase in &quot;hajduk&quot; actions, in parallel with protests of Craiovan boyars. In 1761, under Prince Constantine Mavrocordatos, the &quot;bans&quot; relocated to Bucharest, leaving behind &quot;kaymakams&quot; to represent them in Craiova.

Under Prince Emanuel Giani Ruset, Wallachia&#x27;s seat was moved to Craiova (1770–1771), viewed as a place of refuge during the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774. A large part of the city was burned down by the rebel pasha Osman Pazvantoğlu in 1800.

During the Wallachian uprising of 1821, inhabitants of the present-day Dolj County joined Tudor Vladimirescu&#x27;s Pandurs in great numbers, contributing to the expedition on Bucharest. During the first two decades of the 19th century, Craiova witnessed economic prosperity, centered on handicraft trades and public services. During Imperial Russian occupation and the early stages of &quot;Organic Statute&quot; rules (1828–1834), the city increased its economic output; in 1832 there were 595 shops, 197 of which were made barracks and 398 were houses built of brick. At the time, Craiova exported wheat, furs, leather, live animals and other products into the Austrian and Ottoman Empires.

Costache Romanescu, a citizen of Craiova, was among the leaders of the Provisional Government during the 1848 Wallachian revolution. Wallachia&#x27;s last two rulers, Gheorghe Bibescu and Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei, came from an important boyar family residing in Craiova – the Bibescu family.

Around 1860, there were 4,633 buildings in Craiova, which were 3,220 houses, 26 churches, 11 schools and 60 factories and workshops. In all, the city also housed about 90 industrial establishments, of which 12 were mills, 3 breweries, 2 gas and oil factories, 4 tanning yards and 2 printing presses; 57% of the total number of craftsmen of Dolj County lived in Craiova (1,088 craftsmen, 687 journeymen and 485 apprentices).

The period following the Independence War was a time of economic and cultural progress. As a result, at the end of the 19th century, the city of Craiova, with its 40,000 inhabitants, had developed small factories (producing chemicals, farming utilities, and construction materials) and textile factories. On October 26, 1896, the Craiova power station entered service (with AEG equipment working at 310 CP, supplying 365 streetlights on 39 streets, forming a 30 km-long network); Craiova was the first city in the country to be supplied with electric power by internal combustion engines.

In 1900, Craiova had 43.1% of the industrial units of Oltenia; these numbered 924 industrial companies (including 20 large industrial establishments, employing 1,078 workers). The number of large industrial establishments rose to 40 by 1925. Banking also developed at the beginning of the 20th century (when 6 banks and 2 bureaux de change were already operating).

In the interwar period, Craiova, as the centre of an agricultural region, experienced little further industrialization; the number of industrial workers remained comparatively small. In 1939, Craiova had 7 industrial units with over 100 workers: the clothing industry companies &quot;Oltenia&quot; and &quot;Scrisul Românesc&quot; were well-known all over the country and abroad. The Treaty of Craiova was signed here on 7 September 1940; under its terms, Romania ceded to Bulgaria the territory of Southern Dobruja, which Romania had gained after the 1913 Second Balkan War.

In the early 1960s, under the Communist regime, the city became a centre for the automotive and engine building industries, as well as for aerospace manufacturing, chemical industry, food industry, construction, electrical engineering, mining and the electrical power industry. The construction of housing estates also begins at this time, with Brazda lui Novac being one of the first in 1967–1968, followed by Siloz-Valea Roșie in the same years. Later on in the 1980s the Craiovița Nouă, Rovine, 1 Mai, Sărari and Lăpuș-Argeș housing estates are built.

After the 1989 Revolution brought the re-establishment of a free market and decentralisation in overall management, several industries became subject to privatisation, while the market opened itself to private initiatives. Industry, although affected by economic changes, remains an important branch, representing circa 70% of Craiova&#x27;s output.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Craiova has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;), bordering on a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;). This results in a combination of occasional cold winters, but too mild of a climate to contain permanent snow cover, along with long and hot summers.

Annually, Craiova experiences 64 days with fog, more frequently in winter than other seasons. The city also experiences 34 days per year with thunder, and 1 day with hail.


==Demographics==
, 234,140 inhabitants live within the city limits, a decrease from the figure recorded in 2011, making it the 7th most populous city in Romania.

Ethnic composition (2011):
*Romanians: 241,176 (89.5%)
*Roma: 5,291 (2.0%)

==Economy==

In the first two decades of the 19th century, Craiova was characterized by economic growth and the increased presence of trade, commerce, and public services. Similarly to other large urban areas, Craiova became a commercial, administrative and cultural centre.

During the Tsarist take-over (1828–1834), Craiova experienced significant economic growth. In 1832, there were 595 shops, of which &quot;187 [were] of wood and 398 of stone wall&quot;. The city was the commercial centre of Oltenia. It exported cereal, skins, wax, animals, tallow and services to Austria and Turkey. As a consequence of the permanent high demand for exports, Craiova was the site of the first Romanian society for shares in cereal shipping on the Danube to Brăila, established in 1846.

Around 1860 in Craiova there were 4633 buildings, of which 3220 were houses, 26 churches, 11 schools, and 60 factories or workshops. There were also approximately 90 establishments with an industrial character, of which 12 were wind mills, 3 beer factories, 2 gas and oil factories, 4 tanneries, and 2 were printing houses. Statistics show that Craiova was home to 57.7% of the total number of craftsmen in Dolj County (1088 craftsmen, 687 journeymen and 485 apprentices). Towards the end of the 19th century, the city of Craiova had small factories and workshops with chemical products, agricultural machines, graphic design, tanneries, textiles, construction materials, among others. On 26 October 1896, Craiova&#x27;s power plant (using AEG equipment) began operations, supplying 365 lamps on 39 streets in a network. Craiova was the first city in the country powered by electricity based on internal combustion engines.

In 1900, Craiova held 43.1% of the industrial units in Oltenia, having 924 industrial firms (of which 20 establishments belonged to heavy industry, using 1078 workers). In 1925, the number of heavy industry establishments had increased to 49, and in 1930 the number of workers was 5530. The banking industry was also present; at the beginning of the 20th century, there were 6 banks and 2 bureaux de change.

In the inter-war period, the city, situated in an eminently agricultural area, was considered to be industrialising too slowly in comparison with other urban areas of Romania. 

In 1939, there were only 7 industrial units with over 100 workers in Craiova: the &quot;Oltenia&quot; clothing factory, the &quot;Scrisul Românesc&quot; (&quot;The Romanian Writing&quot;) publishing house, the &quot;Concordia&quot; macaroni factory, the &quot;Barbu Druga&quot; bread and macaroni factory, the &quot;Semănătoarea&quot; factory and the &quot;Traiul&quot; bread factory.
The only branch of industry at the same level of development as other centers of the country was graphic art. The two printing houses &quot;Ramuri&quot; and &quot;Scrisul Românesc&quot; were well-known all over Romania and abroad.

Starting in the 1960s the city became a powerful industrial center; it developed industry in machinery, tools, aircraft, chemicals, food, light industry, construction materials, electronics, extraction, and energy. The Romanian Revolution of 1989 led to important changes in the economy, with the introduction of a free market and decentralization of the management of all national economic sectors. 
In industry, an overall drop in production capacity was noted, caused by an inability to anticipate the impact of change and the economic shocks that followed the change of system. Nevertheless, industry continues to represent the largest sector of the city&#x27;s economy (70%).

== Politics ==

The Craiova Municipal Council, chosen at the 2020 local election, is made up of 27 councillors, with the following party composition:

Public transportation in Craiova started in September 1948 with only 2 buses, received from Bucharest. The buses connected the Craiova railway station with the Nicolae Romanescu Park. The tram was first introduced in 1987, on an double-track line, as a result of the state&#x27;s intention of keeping energy consumption low.

<text>Constanța (, ; , ) is a port city in the Dobruja historical region of Romania. It is the capital of Constanța County and the country&#x27;s fourth largest city and principal port on the Black Sea coast. It is also the oldest continuously inhabited city in the region, founded around 600 BC, and among the oldest in Europe. 

As of the 2021 census, Constanța has a population of 263,688. The Constanța metropolitan area includes 14 localities within of the city. It is one of the largest metropolitan areas in Romania. Ethnic Romanians became a majority in the city in the early 20th century. The city still has small Tatar and Greek communities, which were substantial in previous centuries, as well as Turkish and Romani residents, among others. Constanța has a rich multicultural heritage, as, throughout history, it has been part of different cultures, including Roman, Byzantine, Bulgarian and Ottoman. Following the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), Constanța became part of Romania, and the city, which at the time had a population of just over 5,000 inhabitants, grew significantly throughout the 20th century.

The Port of Constanța has an area of and a length of about . It is the largest port on the Black Sea, and one of the largest ports in Europe.

== History ==



===Ancient history===
Tomis was founded in the 6th century BC as a Greek colony as were nearby the colonies of Histria, Orgame and Kallatis in the same era.
The site had the advantage of a fine harbour, the Carasu valley offering an inland shortcut from the sea to the Danube, and fertile land nearby. The peninsula on which it was sited has high cliffs protecting Tomis from cold winds and from attack.

Most of the ancient city is covered by the modern day Constanta, making archaeology difficult.

In the 5th century BC it was under the influence of the Delian League, passing in this period from oligarchy to democracy. 

The war for the &quot;emporion&quot; of Tomis took place in the middle of the 3rd century BC.

In 29 BC the Romans captured the region from the Odrysian kingdom and annexed it as far as the Danube.

It was a member, perhaps the capital, of the Hexapolis alliance of Greek cities with Histria, Callatis, Dionysupolis, Odessos and Mesambria.

In AD 8, the Roman poet Ovid (43 BC–17 AD) was banished to Tomis by Emperor Augustus for the last eight years of his life. He lamented his Tomisian exile in his poems &quot;Tristia&quot; and &quot;Epistulae ex Ponto&quot;. Tomis was &quot;by his account a town located in a war-stricken cultural wasteland on the remotest margins of the empire&quot;.

A number of inscriptions found in and around the city show that Constanța stands over the site of Tomis. Some of these finds are now preserved in the British Museum in London.

The city was afterwards included in the Province of Moesia and, from the time of Diocletian, in Scythia Minor of which it was the capital. 

In 269 the city was attacked by the Goths who succeeded in destroying only suburbs outside the walls. 

The city lay at the seaward end of the Great Wall of Trajan. Tomis was later called Constantiana, possibly in honour of Constantia, the half-sister of Roman Emperor Constantine the Great or his son Constantius II, a name mentioned for the town by Procopius of Caesarea. In 395, Tomis was assigned to the Eastern Roman Empire.

===Middle Ages===

During Maurice&#x27;s Balkan campaigns, Tomis was besieged by the Avars in the winter of 597/598. It was conquered at the Battle of Ongal by the First Bulgarian Empire in 680. It stayed under Bulgarian rule until the Byzantines under John I Tzimiskes retook it in the Rus-Byzantine War of 970-971. Tomis was then seized by the Second Bulgarian Empire during the Uprising of Asen and Peter in 1186.

By the 14th century Italian nautical maps used the name Constanza.

After almost 200 years as part of Bulgaria, and becoming subsequently an independent principality of Dobrotitsa/Dobrotici and of Wallachia under Mircea I of Wallachia, Constanța fell under Ottoman rule around 1419.

===Recent history===

A railroad linking Constanța to Cernavodă was laid in 1860. In spite of damage done by railway contractors considerable remains of ancient walls, pillars, etc. came to light. What is thought to have been a port building was excavated, and revealed the substantial remains of one of the longest mosaic pavements in the world.

In 1878, after the Romanian War of Independence, Constanța and the rest of Northern Dobruja were ceded by the Ottoman Empire to Romania. The city became Romania&#x27;s main seaport and the transit point for much of Romania&#x27;s exports. The Constanța Casino, a historic monument and a symbol of the modern city, was the first building constructed on the shore of the Black Sea after Dobruja came under Romanian administration, with the cornerstone being laid in 1880.

On 22 October 1916 (during World War I), the Central Powers (German, Turkish and Bulgarian troops) occupied Constanța. According to the Treaty of Bucharest of May 1918, article X.b. (a treaty never ratified by Romania), Constanța remained under the joint control of the Central Powers. The city came afterwards under Bulgarian rule after a regarding the transfer of the jointly administered zone in Northern Dobruja to Bulgaria had been signed in Berlin on 24 September 1918, by Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria. The agreement was short-lived: five days later, on 29 September, Bulgaria capitulated after the successful offensive on the Macedonian front (see the Armistice of Salonica), and the Allied troops liberated the city in 1918.

In the interwar years, the city became Romania&#x27;s main commercial hub, so that by the 1930s over half of its exports were exiting via the port. During World War II, when Romania joined the Axis powers, Constanța was a major target for the Allied bombers. While the town was left relatively unscathed, the port suffered extensive damage, recovering only in the early 1950s.

Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the blockading of the Ukrainian Black Sea ports led to renewed interest in the port of Constanta as one possible outlet for transporting grain to the rest of the world.

==Geography==
Constanța is the administrative center of the county with the same name and the largest city in the Southeastern development region of Romania. The city is located on the Black Sea coast, with a beach length of . Mamaia, a district of Constanța, is the largest and most modern resort on the Romanian coast. Mineral springs in the surrounding area and beachgoing attract many visitors in summer.

==Main sights==



===Ovid&#x27;s Square===

The Emperor Augustus exiled the Roman poet Ovid to what was then Tomis in 8 AD. In 1887, the sculptor Ettore Ferrari designed a statue of the poet which gave its name to this square in the old town. In 1916, during the occupation of Dobruja by the Central Powers, it was taken down by Bulgarian troops, but was later reinstated by the Germans. There is an exact replica of the statue in Sulmona, Ovid&#x27;s hometown in Italy.

The statue stands in front of the National History and Archaeology Museum which is housed in the old City Hall and contains a large collection of ancient art.

===Archaeology Park (&quot;Parcul Arheologic&quot;)===

In the heart of Constanța, the park displays dozens of vestiges of the city&#x27;s past including columns, amphorae, capitals, fragments of 3rd and 4th-century buildings, and a 6th-century tower.

===Roman Mosaics (&quot;Edificiul Roman cu Mozaic&quot;)===

A vast complex of late Roman buildings on three levels once linked the upper town to the harbor and marked its commercial center. Today, only about a third of the original structures remain in Ovid&#x27;s Square, including more than of colourful, if poorly maintained, mosaics. Archaeological traces point to the existence of workshops, warehouses and shops in the area. Remains of the Roman public baths can be seen nearby. Roman aqueducts once brought water to the town.

===Genoese Lighthouse (&quot;Farul Genovez&quot;)===

Soaring , the Genoese Lighthouse was built in 1860 by the Danubius and Black Sea Company to honor Genoese merchants who established a flourishing sea trade community here in the 13th century.

===Casino (&quot;Cazinoul&quot;)===

Commissioned by King Carol I in 1910 and designed by architects Daniel Renard and Petre Antonescu right on the seashore, the derelict Constanța Casino features sumptuous Art Nouveau architecture. Once a huge attraction for European tourists, the casino lost its customers after the collapse of Communism. In 2021 renovation of the building finally began.

The Constanța Aquarium is nearby. 

===House with Lions (&quot;Casa cu Lei&quot;)===

Blending pre-Romanesque and Genoese architectural styles, this late 19th century building features four columns adorned with imposing sculptured lions. During the 1930s, its elegant salons hosted the Constanța Masonic Lodge.

===National Opera and Ballet Theater Oleg Danovski===
Built in 1957 to host theatre productions and operas, the state-funded Dobrogean Musical Theater hosted a multitude of shows written by some of Romania&#x27;s most prolific composers and playwrights. In 1978, master choreographer Oleg Danovski formed the Classical and Contemporary Ballet Ensemble, revitalising the theater&#x27;s significance. After Danovski&#x27;s death in 1996, the shows slowed down, and in 2004 the theater was closed by the Culture Department of the City Council.

===Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul===
Constructed in neo-Byzantine style between 1883 and 1885, the church was severely damaged during World War II and was restored in 1951. The interior murals combine neo-Byzantine style with purely Romanian elements best observed in the iconostasis and pews, chandeliers and candlesticks (bronze and brass alloy), all designed by Ion Mincu and manufactured in Paris.

===Grand Mosque of Constanța (&quot;Marea Moschee din Constanța&quot;)===
Built in 1910 by King Carol I, the Grand Mosque of Constanța (originally the Carol I Mosque) is the seat of the Mufti, the spiritual leader of the 55,000 Muslims (Turks and Tatars by origin) who live along the coast of the Dobrogea region. The building combines Neo-Byzantine and Romanian architectural elements, making it one of the most distinctive mosques in the area. The highlight of the interior is a large Turkish carpet, a gift from Sultan Abdülhamid II; woven at the Hereke factory in Turkey, it is one of the largest carpets in Europe, weighing 1,080 pounds. The minaret (tower) provides views of the old part of town and the harbor. Five times a day, the muezzin climbs 140 steps to the top to call the faithful to prayer.

===Hünkar Mosque (&quot;Geamia Hunchiar&quot;)===

Completed in 1869, the Hünkar Mosque was commissioned by Ottoman Sultan Abdülaziz for Turks who were forced to leave Crimea after the Crimean War (1853–56) and settled in Constanța. It was restored in 1945 and 1992.

===Fantasio Theatre (&quot;Teatrul Fantasio&quot;)===

Originally called the Tranulis Theater after its benefactor, this theater was built in 1927 by Demostene Tranulis, a local philanthropist of Greek origin. A fine building featuring elements of neoclassical architecture, it&#x27;s in the heart of the new city on Ferdinand Boulevard.

===Romanian Navy Museum (&quot;Muzeul marinei române&quot;)===

The largest institution of its kind in Romania, this museum showcases the development of the country&#x27;s military and civil navy. The idea for the museum was outlined in 1919, but it only opened on 3 August 1969 during the regime of Nicolae Ceaușescu. The collections include models of ships, knots, anchors and navy uniforms. It has also a special collection dedicated to figures who were important to the history of the Romanian navy. 

===Natural Sciences Museum Complex (&quot;Complexul Muzeal de Științe ale Naturii&quot;)===

The zoo-like complex consists of a dolphinarium, exotic birds exhibition, and a micro-Delta. There&#x27;s a planetarium next door.

==Climate==

Constanța has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot; in Köppen climate classification). 
Summer (early June to mid September) is hot and sunny, with a July and August average of . Most summer days see a gentle breeze refreshing the daytime temperatures. Nights are warm and somewhat muggy because of the heat stored by the sea.

Autumn starts in mid or late September with warm and sunny days. September can be warmer than June, owing to the warmth accumulated by the Black Sea during the summer. The first frost occurs on average in mid November.

Winter storms, which occur when the sea becomes particularly treacherous, are a common occurrence between December and March.

Four of the warmest seven years from 1889 to 2008 have occurred after the year 2000 (2000, 2001, 2007 and 2008). As of September 2009, the winter and the summer of 2007 were respectively the warmest and the second warmest in recorded history with monthly averages for January (+6.5 °C) and June (+23.0 °C) breaking all-time records. Overall, 2007 was the warmest year since 1889 when weather recording began.

== Demographics ==

, 263,688 inhabitants live within the city limits, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2011 census.

After Bucharest, the capital city, Romania has a number of major cities that are roughly equal in size: Constanța, Iași, Cluj-Napoca, and Timișoara.

The metropolitan area of Constanța has a permanent population of 425,916 inhabitants (2011), i.e. 61% of the total population of the county, and a minimum average of 120,000 per day, tourists or seasonal workers, transient people during the high tourist season.

==Economy==
As of 1878, Constanța was defined as a &quot;poor Turkish fishing village.&quot; As of 1920, it was called &quot;flourishing&quot;, and was known for exporting oil and cereals.

Constanța is one of Romania&#x27;s main industrial, commercial and tourist centers. During the first half of 2008, some 3,144 new companies were established in Constanța and its neighbouring localities, a number surpassed only in Bucharest and Cluj County. The Port of Constanța is the largest on the Black Sea and the fourth largest in Europe. The city also boasts a comparably large shipyard.

Tourism has been an increasingly important economic activity in recent years. Although Constanța has been promoted as a seaside resort since the time of Carol I of Romania, the development of naval industry has had a detrimental effect on the city&#x27;s beaches. However a massive rehabilitation of the beaches was undertaken in 2020 with EU funds that has resulted in new hectares of beach both in downtown Constanta and Mamaia.
Due to its proximity to other major tourist destinations, Constanța receives a significant number of visitors every year, who discover and visit the city&#x27;s monuments and attractions, as well as the increasingly popular festival Neversea. Also, Constanța is a centre of commerce and education, both of which significantly contribute to the local economy.

==Transport==
The opening, in 1895, of the railway to Bucharest, which crosses the Danube River at the bridge at Cernavodă, brought Constanța considerable transit trade in grain and petroleum, which are largely exported; coal and coke head the list of imports, followed by machinery, iron goods, cotton and woollen fabrics.

The A2 motorway provides a rapid road link between Constanța and Bucharest, while the A4 motorway acts as the city&#x27;s outer traffic ring, diverting heavy traffic to and from the Port of Constanța and to Mangalia.
The Port of Constanța includes the North Port and the South Port, and is the fourth largest in Europe. It is protected by breakwaters, with a lighthouse at the entrance. The port is sheltered from the northerly winds, but southerly winds can prove dangerous at times. The Black Sea squadron of the Romanian fleet is stationed here. A large canal (the Danube-Black Sea Canal) connects the Danube River to the Black Sea at Constanța.

The city is served by Mihail Kogălniceanu International Airport.
Constanța&#x27;s public transport system is run by &quot;CT Bus&quot; (formerly &quot;Regia Autonomă de Transport în Comun Constanța&quot; - RATC), and consists of 19 year-round bus lines, and two seasonal lines, including a sightseeing double decker open top bus line.

In the early 2000s, the city bought 130 new MAZ buses to replace the aging fleet of DAC buses. There is also a fleet of double decker Volvo buses that run in the summer, providing access to and from the resort of Mamaia. As of October 2013, the cost of a return ticket is 3 lei.

Trams were active until the late 2000s when they were decommissioned in favour of long-wheelbase buses. Two trolley bus lines were active until the early 2010s – now also decommissioned and replaced by buses.

At the end of March 2014, all public buses were upgraded with Wi-Fi for free use by all passengers. Speeds fall into the 3G HSDPA mobile range. Also, as an upgrade to the ticketing system, since the same time, tickets and per day all bus lines subscriptions can be bought via SMS, accepted by all national operators.

In July 2018 Constanța municipality signed an €18 million-contract to acquire new buses manufactured by the Turkish company Anadolu Isuzu.

In 2019 Constanta&#x27;s new Mercedes-Benz minibusses entered service.

In October 2022 Constanta&#x27;s new BYD electric buses entered service with CT Bus.

Constanța is one of the main focuses of the Rail-2-Sea project which aims to connect it to the Polish Baltic Sea port of Gdańsk with a long railway line passing through Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland.

<doc id="265730" wikidata="Q208788" url="?curid=265730" title="Femtometre">
<text>The femtometre (American spelling femtometer), symbol fm, (derived from the Danish and Norwegian word &#x27;fifteen&#x27;, ) is a unit of length in the International System of Units (SI) equal to 10−15 metres, which means a quadrillionth of one metre. This distance is sometimes called a fermi and was so named in honour of Italian naturalized to American physicist Enrico Fermi, as it is a typical length-scale of nuclear physics.

==Definition and equivalents==
1000000 zeptometres = 1 femtometre = 1 fermi = 0.000001 nanometre = 

 femtometres = 1 millimetre.

For example, the charge radius of a proton is approximately 0.841 femtometres while 
the radius of a gold nucleus is approximately 8.45 femtometres.

1 barn = 100 fm2

==History==
The femtometre was adopted by the 11th &quot;Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures&quot;, and added to the SI in 1964, using the Danish word for &quot;15&quot; and the similarity in spelling with &quot;fermi&quot;.

The fermi is named after the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi (1901–1954), one of the founders of nuclear physics. The term was coined by Robert Hofstadter in a 1956 paper published in &quot;Reviews of Modern Physics&quot; entitled &quot;Electron Scattering and Nuclear Structure&quot;. The term is widely used by nuclear and particle physicists. When Hofstadter was awarded the 1961 Nobel Prize in Physics, it subsequently appeared in the text of his 1961 Nobel Lecture, &quot;The electron-scattering method and its application to the structure of nuclei and nucleons&quot; (December 11, 1961).

<text>PSR B1620-26 b is an exoplanet located approximately 12,400 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Scorpius. It bears the unofficial nicknames &quot;Methuselah&quot; and &quot;the Genesis planet&quot; (named after the Biblical character Methuselah, who, according to the Bible, lived to be the oldest person) due to its extreme age. The planet is in a circumbinary orbit around the two stars of PSR B1620-26 (which are a pulsar (PSR B1620-26 A) and a white dwarf (WD B1620-26)) and is the first circumbinary planet ever confirmed. It is also the first planet found in a globular cluster. The planet is one of the oldest known extrasolar planets, believed to be about 12.7 billion years old.

==Characteristics==

===Mass, orbit, and age===
PSR B1620-26 b has a mass of 2.627 times that of Jupiter, and orbits at a distance of 23 AU (3.4 billion km), a little larger than the distance between Uranus and the Sun. Each orbit of the planet takes about 100 years.

The triple system is just outside the core of the globular cluster Messier 4. The age of the cluster has been estimated to be about 12.7 billion years, and because all stars in a cluster form at about the same time, and planets form together with their host stars, it is likely that PSR B1620-26 b is also about 12.7 billion years old. This is much older than any other known planet discovered to date, and nearly three times as old as Earth.

===Host stars===
PSR B1620-26 b orbits a pair of stars. The primary star, PSR B1620-26, is a pulsar, a neutron star spinning at 100 revolutions per second, with a mass of 1.34 , a likely radius of around 20 kilometers (0.00003 ) and a likely temperature less than or equal to 300,000 K. The second is a white dwarf with a mass of 0.34 , a likely radius of around 0.01 , and a likely temperature less than or equal to 25,200 K. These stars orbit each other at a distance of 1 AU about once every six months. The age of the system is 12.7 to 13 billion years old, making this one of the oldest binary stars known. In comparison, the Sun has an age of 4.6 billion years. 

The binary system&#x27;s apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth&#x27;s perspective, is 24. It is far too dim to be seen with the naked eye.

===Evolutionary history===

The origin of this pulsar planet is still uncertain, but it probably did not form where it is found today. Because of the decreased gravitational force when the core of star collapses to a neutron star and ejects most of its mass in a supernova explosion, it is unlikely that a planet could remain in orbit after such an event. It is more likely that the planet formed in orbit around the star that has now evolved into the white dwarf, and that the star and planet were only later captured into orbit around the neutron star.

Stellar encounters are not very common in the disk of the Milky Way, where the Sun is, but in the dense core of globular clusters, they occur frequently. At some point during the 10 billion years, the neutron star is thought to have encountered and captured the host star of the planet into a tight orbit, probably losing a previous companion star in the process.
About half a billion years ago, the newly captured star began to expand into a red giant (see stellar evolution).

Typical pulsar periods for young pulsars are of the order of one second, and they increase with time; the very short periods exhibited by so-called millisecond pulsars are due to the transfer of material from a binary companion. The pulse period of PSR B1620-26 is a few milliseconds, providing strong evidence for matter transfer. It is believed that as the pulsar&#x27;s red giant companion expanded, it filled and then exceeded its Roche lobe, so that its surface layers started being transferred onto the neutron star.

The infalling matter produced complex and spectacular effects. The infalling matter &#x27;spun up&#x27; the neutron star, due to the transfer of angular momentum, and for a few hundred million years, the stars formed a low-mass X-ray binary, as the infalling matter was heated to temperatures high enough to glow in X-rays.

Mass transfer came to an end when the surface layers of the mass-losing star were depleted, and the core slowly shrunk to a white dwarf. Now the stars peacefully orbit around each other. The long-term prospects for PSR B1620-26 b are poor, though. The triple system, which is much more massive than a typical isolated star in M4, is slowly drifting down into the core of the cluster, where the density of stars is very high. In a billion years or so, the triple will probably have another close encounter with a nearby star. The most common outcome of such encounters is that the lightest companion is ejected from the multiple star system. If this happens, PSR B1620-26 b will most likely be ejected completely from M4, and will spend the rest of its existence wandering alone in interstellar space as an interstellar planet.

==Detection and discovery==
Like nearly all extrasolar planets discovered prior to 2008, PSR B1620-26 b was originally detected through the Doppler shifts its orbit induces on radiation from the star it orbits (in this case, changes in the apparent pulsation period of the pulsar). In the early 1990s, a group of astronomers led by Donald Backer, who were studying what they thought was a binary pulsar, determined that a third object was needed to explain the observed Doppler shifts. Within a few years, the gravitational effects of the planet on the orbit of the pulsar and white dwarf had been measured, giving an estimate of the mass of the third object that was too small for it to be a star. The conclusion that the third object was a planet was announced by Stephen Thorsett and his collaborators in 1993.

The study of the planetary orbit allowed the mass of the white dwarf star to be estimated as well, and theories of the formation of the planet suggested that the white dwarf should be young and hot. On July 10, 2003, the detection of the white dwarf and confirmation of its predicted properties were announced by a team led by Steinn Sigurdsson, using observations from the Hubble Space Telescope. It was at a NASA press briefing that the name Methuselah was introduced, capturing press attention around the world.

==Name==
While the designation PSR B1620-26 b is not used in any scientific papers, the planet is listed in the SIMBAD database as PSR B1620-26 b. Some popular sources use the designation PSR B1620-26 c to refer to the planet, as it was described as the third member of a triple system (composed of the planet and two stars). This designation doesn&#x27;t appear in the SIMBAD database, and more modern naming conventions use a separated lettering system where lower-case letters to refer to planets and upper-case letters to designate stars (e.g. Gliese 667 Cc is the &#x27;c&#x27; planet orbiting Gliese 667C, which is the &#x27;C&#x27; star of a triple system), making PSR B1620-26 b the designation for a planet orbiting both stars of the PSR B1620-26 system. Neither usage is employed in the scientific literature with respect to the PSR B1620-26 planet.

Though not officially recognized, the name &quot;Methuselah&quot; is commonly used for the planet in popular articles. This name is usually used as the informal name to show the similarities to the planets of the Solar System, while the &quot;letter name&quot; is used astronomically. Methuselah is the only planet to have received a biblical name or nickname, although three other extrasolar planets have been unofficial mythological nicknames (just like in the Solar System), those planets being Dimidium, originally dubbed &quot;Bellerophon&quot;; Gliese 581 g, sometimes called &quot;Zarmina,&quot; or even more rarely &quot;Zarmina&#x27;s World&quot; or &quot;Zarmina&#x27;s Planet&quot;; and HD 209458 b, occasionally referred to as &quot;Osiris.&quot;

<text>John Strype (1 November 1643 – 11 December 1737) was an English clergyman, historian and biographer from London. He became a merchant when settling in Petticoat Lane. In his twenties, he became perpetual curate of Theydon Bois, Essex and later became curate of Leyton; this allowed him direct correspondence with several highly notable ecclesiastical figures of his time. He wrote extensively in his later years.

==Life==
Born in Houndsditch, London, he was the son of John Strype (or van Stryp) and cousin to sailor and writer Robert Knox. A member of a Huguenot family who, in order to escape religious persecution within Brabant, had settled in East London. Located in what has now become known as Strype Street in Petticoat Lane, he was a merchant and silk throwster. The younger John was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School, and on 5 July 1662 entered Jesus College, Cambridge; he went on from there to St Catharine&#x27;s Hall, where he graduated B.A. in 1665 and M.A. in 1669.

On 14 July 1669 Strype became perpetual curate of Theydon Bois, and a few months afterwards curate and lecturer of Leyton in the same county. He was never instituted or inducted to the living of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Leyton, but in 1674 he was licensed by the Bishop of London to preach and expound the word of God, and to perform the office of priest and curate while it was vacant, and until his death he received the profits of it. In 1711 he obtained from Archbishop Thomas Tenison the sinecure of West Tarring, Sussex, and he discharged the duties of lecturer at Hackney from 1689 until 1724. In Hackney, he spent his last years with a married granddaughter, the wife of a surgeon, Thomas Harris, dying there at the age of 94. He was buried in the church at Leyton.

==Works==
Through his friendship with Sir William Hicks, Strype obtained access to the papers of Sir Michael Hicks, secretary to Lord Burghley, from which he made extensive transcripts; he also carried on an extensive correspondence with Archbishop William Wake and Bishops Gilbert Burnet, Francis Atterbury and Nicholson. The materials he obtained were used in his historical and biographical works, which relate chiefly to the period of the Protestant Reformation. Most of his original materials have been preserved, and are included among the Lansdowne manuscripts in the British Library. His publications consist historical reference material of considerable value, and are convenient books of reference.

Strype&#x27;s major works are:
*the &quot;Memorials of Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury&quot;, 1694 (ed. for the EccI. Hist. Soc., in 3 vols., Oxford, 1848–1854; and in 2 vols. with notes by PE Barnes, London, 1853)
*&quot;Life of the learned Sir Thomas Smith&quot; (1698)
*&quot;Life and Acts of John Aylmer, Lord Bishop of London&quot; (1701)
*&quot;Life of the learned Sir John Cheke, with his Treatise on Superstition&quot; (1705)
*&quot;Annals of the Reformation in England&quot; (4 volumes: vol. I 1709–1725; vol. II 1725; vol. III 1728; vol. IV 1731, 2nd edition 1735, 3rd edition 1736–1738)
*&quot;Life and Acts of Edmund Grindal, Archbishop of Canterbury&quot; (1710)
*&quot;Life and Acts of Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury&quot; (1711)
*&quot;Life and Acts of John Whitgift, Archbishop of Canterbury&quot; (1718)
*&quot;A Survey of the Cities of London and Westminster&quot; (1720), an updated edition of the original &quot;A Survey of London&quot; by John Stow (1598, 2nd edition 1603)
*&quot;Ecclesiastical Memorials&quot; (5 vols., 1721; 3 vols., 1733).
His &quot;Historical and Biographical Works&quot; were reprinted in 59 vols. at the Clarendon Press, Oxford, between 1812 (Cranmer) and 1824 (Annals). A general index by Robert French Laurence in 2 vols. was added in 1828. Strype also published, besides a number of single sermons, an edition of John Lightfoot&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot; (1684); and in 1700 Some genuine &quot;Remains of John Lightfoot ...&quot; with a large preface concerning the author.

<text>better known by his stage name is a Japanese actor, director, and musician, who has had an extensive career working in both Japanese and international cinema. He has been nominated for five Japan Academy Film Prizes, twice for Best Actor and three times for Best Supporting Actor, and winner of its Most Popular Performer award.

Among his best-known roles are in Hirokazu Kore-eda&#x27;s &quot;Maboroshi no Hikari&quot; (1995) and &quot;Distance&quot; (2001), Hyozo Tashiro in &quot;Gohatto&quot; (1999), Kakihara in &quot;Ichi the Killer&quot; (2001), Hattori Genosuke in &quot;Zatoichi&quot; (2003), Kenji in &quot;Last Life in the Universe&quot; (also 2003), and Temujin in &quot;Mongol&quot; (2007). He has also appeared in Hollywood films, notably as Hogun in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Lord Kira Yoshinaka in &quot;47 Ronin&quot; (2013)&quot;,&quot; the Interpreter in &quot;Silence&quot; (2016), Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi in &quot;Midway&quot; (2019), and Raiden in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2021), based on the fighting video game of the same name. He gained additional recognition in 2024 for his portrayal of Lord Kashigi Yabushige on the American television series &quot;Shōgun&quot;, based on the James Clavell novel, for which he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film.

Asano has worked with some of the most prominent and acclaimed directors in Japanese cinema, including Hirokazu Kore-eda, Takeshi Kitano, Nagisa Ōshima, Takashi Miike, Nobuhiko Obayashi and Kiyoshi Kurosawa, along with international directors like Martin Scorsese, Kenneth Branagh, Wong Kar-wai, Roland Emmerich, Pen-ek Ratanaruang and Sergei Bodrov. Among other accolades, he has twice won the Best Actor Award at the Yokohama Film Festival, the Upstream Prize for Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival&quot;,&quot; and the Best Actor Award at the Moscow International Film Festival.

== Early life ==
Asano was born in the Honmoku area of Yokohama, to artist and mother Junko (順子). Through his mother, Asano is of one-quarter American ancestry. His maternal grandfather was Willard Overing, a U.S. citizen of Norwegian descent, whom Asano never met. Asano has an older brother, Kujun Satō, born in 1971, who is a musician and a partner in Anore Inc. (now Adonis A), a talent agency Asano and their father Yukihisa Satō founded.

== Career ==
Asano&#x27;s father, an actors&#x27; agent, suggested he take on his first acting role in the TV show &quot;Kinpachi Sensei&quot; at the age of 16. His film debut was in the 1990 &quot;Swimming Upstream&quot; (&quot;Bataashi Kingyo&quot;), though his first major critical success was in Shunji Iwai&#x27;s &quot;Fried Dragon Fish&quot; (1993). His first critical success internationally was Hirokazu Kore-eda&#x27;s &quot;Maboroshi no Hikari&quot; (1995), in which he played a man who inexplicably throws himself in front of a train, widowing his wife and orphaning his infant son. He also worked with Kore-eda in the pseudo-documentary &quot;Distance&quot; in 2001. His best known works internationally are the samurai films &quot;Gohatto&quot; (aka &quot;Taboo&quot;, 1999) and &quot;Zatoichi&quot; (2003), as well as the critically acclaimed &quot;Bright Future&quot;.

Asano acted in Katsuhito Ishii&#x27;s 2003 film &quot;The Taste of Tea&quot;, which premiered at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. He appeared as the lead actor in &quot;Last Life in the Universe&quot; (2003) by Thai director Pen-Ek Ratanaruang and starred in Ratanaruang&#x27;s 2006 follow-up film, &quot;Invisible Waves&quot;. In 2007, he starred as the young Genghis Khan in Sergei Bodrov&#x27;s Oscar-nominated film &quot;Mongol&quot;. In &quot;Villon&#x27;s Wife&quot; (2009), he played the part of an alcoholic writer, stating that, since he doesn&#x27;t drink alcohol, he based his performance on people he knows. In 2011, he starred in the Marvel Studios film &quot;Thor&quot; as the Asgardian warrior Hogun, a member of the Warriors Three and companion to Thor. He reprised the role in 2013&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and 2017&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. 

Asano appeared in the 2021 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; reboot as Raiden. In September 2021, Asano was announced as part of the cast of the FX limited series &quot;Shōgun&quot;, adapted from the James Clavell novel.

In addition to his acting career, Asano directed commercial TV spots for his then-wife, Chara. He formed the band MACH-1.67 with director Sogo Ishii in 1996 and has also played in the bands Peace Pill and Safari. He is an artist and a model, most notably for Japanese fashion designers Jun Takahashi and Takeo Kikuchi, for whom he filmed a series of commercial spots directed by Wong Kar-wai, including the short film &quot;wkw/tk/1996@7&#x27;55&quot;hk.net&quot;.

Asano and his father left the actors&#x27; agency Anore Inc. (now Adonis A) in 2022. After leaving the agency, he continued to give it his support.

== Personal life ==
Asano met J-pop singer Chara on the set of Iwai&#x27;s &quot;Picnic&quot; (1994). They were married in March 1995 while Chara was pregnant with their first child, a daughter named Sumire, who was born on July 4 that same year. In 1999, they had a son named Himi. In July 2009, Chara announced on her website that the couple was divorcing. She received custody of both their children.

In August 2022, Asano announced through his Twitter and Instagram accounts that he had married model and actress Kurumi Nakata who is eighteen years younger than him ( 1991). The two had reportedly been in a relationship for over six years.

== Awards ==
Asano won the Most Popular Performer award at the 1997 Japanese Academy Awards for &quot;Acri&quot; and was nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category in 2004 for his performance in &quot;Zatôichi.&quot; He also received the Upstream Prize for Best Actor at the 2003 Venice Film Festival for his role in &quot;Last Life in the Universe&quot;. In 2014, he won the award for Best Actor at the 36th Moscow International Film Festival for his role in &quot;My Man&quot;. In 2024, he was nominated Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 76th Primetime Emmy Awards for his performance in Shōgun, his first nomination for the Primetime Emmy Awards.

<text>John Stow (&quot;also&quot; Stowe; 1524/25 – 5 April 1605) was an English historian and antiquarian. He wrote a series of chronicles of English history, published from 1565 onwards under such titles as &quot;The Summarie of Englyshe Chronicles&quot;, &quot;The Chronicles of England&quot;, and &quot;The Annales of England&quot;; and also &quot;A Survey of London&quot; (1598; second edition 1603). A. L. Rowse has described him as &quot;one of the best historians of that age; indefatigable in the trouble he took, thorough and conscientious, accurate – above all things devoted to truth&quot;.

==Life==
John Stow was born in about 1525 in the City of London parish of St Michael, Cornhill, then at the heart of London&#x27;s metropolis. His father, Thomas Stow, was a tallow chandler. Thomas Stow is recorded as paying rent of 6s 8d per year for the family dwelling, and as a youth Stow would fetch milk every morning from a farm on the land nearby to the east owned by the Minoresses of the Convent of St. Clare. There is no evidence that he ever attended a grammar school: his learning appears to have been largely self-acquired.

Stow did not take up his father&#x27;s trade of tallow chandlery, instead becoming an apprentice, and in 1547 a freeman, of the Merchant Taylors&#x27; Company, by which stage he had set up business in premises close to the Aldgate Pump in Aldgate, near to Leadenhall Street and Fenchurch Street.

In about 1560 he started upon his major work, the &quot;Survey of London&quot;. His antiquarian interests attracted suspicion from the ecclesiastical authorities as a person &quot;with many dangerous and superstitious books in his possession&quot;, and in February 1569 his house was searched. An inventory was made of all the books at his home, especially those &quot;in defence of papistry&quot;, but he was able to satisfy his interrogators as to the soundness of his Protestantism. A second attempt to incriminate him was made in 1570 also without success.

In about 1570 he moved to the parish of St Andrew Undershaft in the Ward of Lime Street, where he lived in comfortable surroundings until his death in 1605.

==Antiquarian network==
Stow was in close contact with many of the leading antiquarians of his day, including Archbishop Matthew Parker, John Joscelyn, John Dee, William Fleetwood, William Lambarde, Robert Glover, Henry Savile, William Camden, Henry Ferrers and Thomas Hatcher. He was active in the first Society of Antiquaries, established in about 1586. He built up an extensive library of manuscript and printed historical sources, which became known to contemporaries as his &quot;storehouse&quot;, and which he was generous in making available to others.

==Personality==
Stow was highly esteemed by his antiquarian contemporaries, probably in no small part because of his willingness to share his material. Sir George Buck wrote of &quot;honest John Stow, who could not flatter and speak dishonestly, and who was a man very diligent and much inquisitive to uncover all things concerning the affairs or words or persons of princes&quot;, and characterised him as a &quot;good antiquary and diligent searcher of knowledge&quot;. Edmund Howes described him in later life as being &quot;of a pleasant and cheerful countenance; his sight and memory very good; very sober, mild, and courteous to any that required his instructions; and retained the true use of all his senses unto the day of his death, being of an excellent memory&quot;.

Nevertheless, he was drawn into several bitter quarrels and harboured longstanding grudges. One protracted feud was with his younger brother, Thomas, over their respective shares in their mother&#x27;s estate before and after her death in 1568 (John believed he was entitled to a greater share as the eldest son; Thomas claimed a greater share because he had cared for their mother during her final years). He had further arguments with neighbours, including William Ditcher and a Mister Crowche. His quarrel with his rival chronicler Richard Grafton is noted below.

==Later years and death==
Stow&#x27;s literary efforts did not prove very remunerative, but he accepted his relative poverty with cheerful spirit: Ben Jonson relates once walking with him when Stow jocularly asked two mendicant cripples &quot;what they would have to take him to their order&quot;. From 1579 he was in receipt of a pension of £4 per annum from the Merchant Taylors&#x27; Company; and in 1590 he petitioned the Court of Aldermen for admission to the Freedom of the City of London, in order to reduce his expenses. In about the 1590s, William Camden commissioned Stow to transcribe six autograph notebooks of John Leland in exchange for a life annuity of £8: this was probably (in part) a charitable gesture towards an old but impoverished friend. In March 1604 King James I authorised Stow and his associates to collect &quot;amongst our loving subjects their voluntary contributions and &#x27;kind gratuities&#x27;&quot;, and himself began &quot;the largesse for the example of others&quot;. While such royal approval was welcome it reaped dividend too slowly for Stow to enjoy any substantial benefit during his lifetime.

Stow died on 5 April 1605, and was buried in the church of St Andrew Undershaft on the corner of Leadenhall Street and St Mary Axe.

==Works==
Stow published his first work, &quot;The woorkes of Geffrey Chaucer, newly printed with divers additions whiche were never in printe before&quot;, in 1561.

This was followed in 1565 by his &quot;Summarie of Englyshe Chronicles&quot; (in small octavo format), and in 1566 by the related but distinct &quot;Summarie of Englyshe Chronicles ... Abridged&quot; (in sextodecimo format). Both works ran through multiple editions during Stow&#x27;s lifetime: editions of the &quot;Summarie&quot; appeared in 1566, 1570, 1574, 1575 and 1590 (with additional posthumous editions, by Edmund Howes, in 1607, 1611 and 1618); and of the &quot;Summarie Abridged&quot; in 1567, 1573, 1584, 1587, 1598, and 1604. The &quot;Summarie Abridged&quot; makes disparaging allusions in its preface to the rival &quot;Abridgement of the Chronicles of England&quot; of Richard Grafton: the dispute between the two men continued to fester until Grafton&#x27;s death in 1573.

In 1580, Stow published the more expansive &quot;The Chronicles of England, from Brute unto this present yeare of Christ, 1580&quot;. He later developed this into the still more substantial &quot;The Annales of England&quot;, of which editions appeared in 1592, 1601, and 1605 – the last being continued to 26 March 1605, or within ten days of Stow&#x27;s own death. Further posthumous editions by Edmund Howes were published in 1615 and 1631.

Under Archbishop Matthew Parker&#x27;s patronage, Stow was persuaded to produce a version of &quot;Flores historiarum&quot;, allegedly by &quot;Matthew of Westminster&quot;, published in 1567; and then the &quot;Chronicle of Matthew Paris&quot; in 1571, and the &quot;Historia brevis&quot; of Thomas Walsingham in 1574. In the &quot;Chronicle of England 1590&quot; Stow writes: &quot;To The Honorable Sir John Hart, Lord Maior. The Chronicle written before that nothing is perfect the first time, and that it is incident to mankinde to erre and slip sometimes, but the point of fanta[s]tical fooles to preserve and continue in their errors.&quot;

At the urging of Archbishop Parker, Stow also compiled a &quot;farre larger volume&quot;, a history of Britain entitled &quot;A Historie of this Iland&quot;. He announced this as &quot;ready to the presse&quot; in 1592, but it proved too ambitious to be commercially viable, and he was unable to find a printer prepared to publish it. The manuscript is lost.

===&quot;Survey of London&quot;===
The work for which Stow is best known is his &quot;Survey of London&quot; (original spelling: &quot;A Survay of London&quot;), published in 1598. This was a work of chorography: a detailed ward-by-ward topographical and historical tour of the city, providing a unique account of its buildings, social conditions and customs. A second, revised edition appeared in 1603. Following Stow&#x27;s death, a third edition, with additions by Anthony Munday appeared in 1618; a fourth by Munday and Humfrey Dyson in 1633; a fifth with interpolated amendments by John Strype in 1720; and a sixth by the same editor in 1754. The edition of 1598 was reprinted, edited by William John Thoms, in 1842, in 1846, and (with illustrations) in 1876. An edition based on that of 1598, edited by Henry Morley, was published in 1889, and has been reprinted on several occasions since.

A critical edition, based on that of 1603 and edited in two volumes by C. L. Kingsford, was published in 1908, and republished with additional notes in 1927. This remains the standard scholarly edition. A more popular single-volume edition was published in Everyman&#x27;s Library, with an introduction by H. B. Wheatley, in 1912 (revised edition 1956), and has been frequently reprinted.

==Manuscripts and collections==
Many of Stow&#x27;s own autograph manuscripts are now held in the British Library, notably in the Harley Collection; and others in the Bodleian Library. Some in Lambeth Palace Library (MS 306) were published in 1880 by the Camden Society, edited by James Gairdner, as &quot;Three Fifteenth Century Chronicles, with Historical Memoranda by John Stowe the Antiquary, and Contemporary Notes of Occurrences written by him&quot;.

The manuscript and printed works that made up his library are now scattered, but can often be identified through the many annotations he made to them.

==Commemoration and legacy==

Stow&#x27;s widow commissioned a mural monument to him in St Andrew Undershaft, made of Derbyshire marble and alabaster. The work has been tentatively attributed to Nicholas Johnson. It includes an effigy of Stow, which was originally coloured: he is represented seated at a desk, writing in a book (probably the revision of his &quot;Annales&quot;, which he continued to 26 March, ten days before his death), and flanked by other books. Above him is the motto, based on an epigram of Pliny the Younger, &quot;Aut scribenda agere, aut legenda scribere&quot; (&quot;[Blessed is he to whom it is given] either to do things that are worth writing about, or to write things that are worth reading about&quot;). The figure holds a real quill pen, in a manner similar to the effigy of William Shakespeare at Stratford-upon-Avon: the latter monument has been attributed, on equally tentative grounds, either to Nicholas Johnson&#x27;s brother, Gerard, or more recently to Nicholas himself.

In acknowledgement of Stow&#x27;s continuing reputation as the founding father of London history, the quill held by his effigy has been periodically renewed. The renewal is mentioned as taking place &quot;annually&quot; in 1828; and, although the custom may later have fallen into abeyance, it was revived following the monument&#x27;s restoration by the Merchant Taylors&#x27; Company in 1905. In 1924, the ceremony was incorporated into a special church service, with an address by a London historian; and this service continued to be held annually every April until 1991, including the years of the Second World War. No services could be held in 1992 or 1993 because of damage to the church caused by the Baltic Exchange bomb of 1992. The service was revived in 1994, but from 1996 to 2017 was held only once every three years. The service due to take place in 2020 was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the next service took place in 2024. The services are jointly sponsored by the Merchant Taylors&#x27; Company and the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society, with the quill supplied by the society. The exchange of the quill is undertaken by the Lord Mayor of London or the Master Merchant Taylor alternately.

Stow&#x27;s &quot;Survey of London&quot; lends its title to the Survey of London, a comprehensive multi-volume architectural survey of the former County of London, founded in 1894 and still in progress.

<text>In web applications, a rewrite engine is a software component that performs rewriting on URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), modifying their appearance. This modification is called URL rewriting. It is a way of implementing URL mapping or routing within a web application. The engine is typically a component of a web server or web application framework. Rewritten URLs (sometimes known as short, pretty or fancy URLs, search engine friendly - SEF URLs, or slugs) are used to provide shorter and more relevant-looking links to web pages. The technique adds a layer of abstraction between the files used to generate a web page and the URL that is presented to the outside world.

==Usage==

Web sites with dynamic content can use URLs that generate pages from the server using query string parameters. These are often rewritten to resemble URLs for static pages on a site with a subdirectory hierarchy. For example, the URL to a wiki page with title &quot;Rewrite_engine&quot; might be:
 http://example.com/w/index.php?title=Rewrite_engine
but can be rewritten as:
 http://example.com/wiki/Rewrite_engine

A blog might have a URL that encodes the dates of each entry:
 http://www.example.com/Blog/Posts.php?Year=2006&amp;Month=12&amp;Day=19
It can be altered like this:
 http://www.example.com/Blog/2006/12/19/
which also allows the user to change the URL to see all postings available in December, simply by removing the text encoding the day &#x27;19&#x27;, as though navigating &quot;up&quot; a directory:
 http://www.example.com/Blog/2006/12/

A site can pass specialized terms from the URL to its search engine as a search term. This would allow users to search directly from their browser. For example, the URL as entered into the browser&#x27;s location bar:
 http://example.com/search term
will be URL-encoded by the browser before it makes the HTTP request. The server could rewrite this to:
 http://example.com/search.php?q=search%20term

==Benefits and drawbacks==

There are several benefits to using URL rewriting:
* The links are &quot;cleaner&quot; and more descriptive, improving their &quot;friendliness&quot; to both users and search engines.
* They prevent undesired &quot;inline linking&quot;, which can waste bandwidth.
* The site can continue to use the same URLs even if the underlying technology used to serve them is changed (for example, switching to a new blogging engine).

There can, however be drawbacks as well; if a user wants to modify a URL to retrieve new data, URL rewriting may hinder the construction of custom queries due to the lack of named variables. For example, it may be difficult to determine the date from the following format:
 http://www.example.com/Blog/06/04/02/
In this case, the original query string was more useful, since the query variables indicated month and day:
 http://www.example.com/Blog/Posts.php?Year=06&amp;Month=04&amp;Day=02

==Web frameworks==
Many web frameworks include URL rewriting, either directly or through extension modules.

* Apache HTTP Server has URL rewriting provided by the mod_rewrite module.
* URL Rewrite is available as an extension to Microsoft IIS.
* Ruby on Rails has built-in URL rewriting via Routes.
* Jakarta Servlet has extendable URL rewriting via the OCPsoft URLRewriteFilter and Tuckey UrlRewriteFilter.
* Jakarta Faces has simplified URL rewriting via the PrettyFaces: URLRewriteFilter.
* Django uses a regular-expressions-based system. This is not strictly URL rewriting since there is no script to &#x27;rewrite&#x27; to, nor even a directory structure; but it provides the full flexibility of URL rewriting.
* Java Stripes Framework has had integrated functionality since version 1.5.
* Many Perl frameworks, such as Mojolicious and Catalyst, have this feature.
* CodeIgniter has URL rewriting provided.
* lighttpd has a mod_rewrite module.
* nginx has a rewrite module. For example, a multi-link multi-variable page generation from a URI like is possible, where multiple individual parts like get expanded with the help of regular expressions into variables to signify and so forth.
* Hiawatha HTTP server has a URL Toolkit which supports URL rewriting.
* Cherokee HTTP server supports regular expressions of URL rewriting and redirections.

From a software development perspective, URL rewriting can aid in code modularization and control flow, making it a useful feature of modern web frameworks.

<text>Matthew of Westminster was long regarded as the author of the &quot;Flores Historiarum&quot; (in fact written by Matthew Paris), and is now thought never to have existed.

The error was first discovered in 1826 by Francis Turner Palgrave, who said that Matthew was &quot;a phantom who never existed,&quot; and later the truth of this statement was completely proved by Henry Richards Luard. The name appears to have been taken from that of Matthew Paris, who likely authored the &quot;Flores&quot; to serve as an abridgement of his larger &quot;Chronica majora&quot;, and from Westminster Abbey, where the work was continued and copied after Paris&#x27;s death.

He is sometimes surnamed Florilegus (literally &quot;flower-gatherer&quot;), in reference to the title of his supposed work.

<text>Charles Bémont (16 November 1848 – 21 September 1939), French scholar, was born in Paris.

==Life==
In 1884 he graduated with two theses, one on Simon de Montfort translated as &quot;Simon de Montfort: Earl of Leicester, 1208-1265&quot; (1930), without the thesis&#x27; appendices of historical documents, and &quot;La Condamnation de Jean Sansterre&quot; (&quot;Revue historique&quot;, 1886). His &quot;Les Chartes des libertés anglaises&quot; (1892) has an introduction upon the history of Magna Carta, etc., and his history of medieval Europe, written in collaboration with Gabriel Monod (1896), was translated into English, as &quot;Medieval Europe from 395 to 1270&quot;.

He was also responsible for the continuation of the Gascon Rolls, the publication of which had been begun by Francisque Xavier Michel in 1885. His supplement to Volume I was published in 1896, his Volume II in 1900, and his Volume III in 1906, bringing the published years of the rolls up to 1307. He received the honorary degree of Litt. Doc. at Oxford in 1909. He was made a corresponding member of the British Academy in 1914.

A street in Croissy-sur-Seine commemorates him.

<text>Francisque Xavier Michel (18 February 1809, Lyon – 18 May 1887, Paris) was a French historian and philologist.

== Life ==

He became known for his editions of French works of the Middle Ages, and the French Government, recognizing their value, sent him to England (1833) and Scotland (1837) to continue his research there. In 1837 he became a member of the Comité Historique and in 1838 chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur. In 1839 he was appointed professor of foreign literature in the &quot;Faculté des lettres&quot; at the University of Bordeaux. Between 1834 and 1842 he published editions of many works written between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries in French, English, and Saxon, including the &quot;Roman de la rose&quot; and the &quot;Chanson de Roland&quot;. 
He got his licence in literature in 1842, and his doctorat in 1846, with a thesis in Latin on Virgil and a thesis in French, entitled: &quot;Histoire des races maudites de la France et de l&#x27;Espagne&quot;. Subsequently, he published French translations of Goldsmith, Sterne, Shakespeare, and Tennyson. In 1857 he published his important book on the Basque Country: &quot;Le Pays Basque, sa population, sa langue, ses moeurs, sa littérature et sa musique&quot;.

<text>Loch Lomond (; ) is a freshwater Scottish loch which crosses the Highland Boundary Fault, often considered the boundary between the lowlands of Central Scotland and the Highlands. Traditionally forming part of the boundary between the counties of Stirlingshire and Dunbartonshire, Loch Lomond is split between the council areas of Stirling, Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire. Its southern shores are about northwest of the centre of Glasgow, Scotland&#x27;s largest city. The Loch forms part of the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park which was established in 2002.

Loch Lomond is long and between wide, with a surface area of . It is the largest lake in Great Britain by surface area; in the United Kingdom, it is surpassed only by Lough Neagh and Lough Erne in Northern Ireland. In the British Isles as a whole there are several larger loughs in the Republic of Ireland. The loch has a maximum depth of about in the deeper northern portion, although the southern part of the loch rarely exceeds in depth. The total volume of Loch Lomond is , making it the second largest lake in Great Britain, after Loch Ness, by water volume.

The loch contains many islands, including Inchmurrin, the largest fresh-water island in the British Isles. Loch Lomond is a popular leisure destination and is featured in the song &quot;The Bonnie Banks o&#x27; Loch Lomond&quot;. The loch is surrounded by hills, including Ben Lomond on the eastern shore, which is in height and the most southerly of the Scottish Munro peaks. A 2005 poll of &quot;Radio Times&quot; readers voted Loch Lomond as the sixth greatest natural wonder in Britain.

==Etymology==
Loch Lomond takes its name from the highest peak in the area, Ben Lomond, , meaning ‘beacon mountain’ i.e. a site for warning beacons. However, the region in which the loch is located is anglicised as Lennox and Loch Lomond &quot;was of old &quot;Loch Leamhna&quot;&quot; after the River Leven which means ‘elm water’ in Gaelic.

==Formation==
The depression in which Loch Lomond lies was carved out by glaciers during the final stages of the last ice age, during a return to glacial conditions known as the Loch Lomond Readvance between 20,000 and 10,000 years ago. The loch lies on the Highland Boundary Fault, and the difference between the Highland and Lowland geology is reflected in the shape and character of the loch: in the north the glaciers dug a deep channel in the Highland schist, removing up to 600 m of bedrock to create a narrow, fjord-like finger lake. Further south the glaciers were able to spread across the softer Lowland sandstone, leading to a wider body of water that is rarely more than 30 m deep. In the period following the Loch Lomond Readvance the sea level rose, and for several periods Loch Lomond was connected to the sea, with shorelines identified at 13, 12 and 9 metres above sea level (the current loch lies at 8 m above sea level).

The change in rock type can be clearly seen at points around the loch, as it runs across the islands of Inchmurrin, Creinch, Torrinch and Inchcailloch and over the ridge of Conic Hill. To the south lie green fields and cultivated land; to the north, mountains.

==Islands==
The loch contains thirty or more other islands, depending on the water level. Several of them are large by the standards of British bodies of freshwater. Inchmurrin, for example, is the largest island in a body of freshwater in the British Isles. Many of the islands are the remains of harder rocks that withstood the passing of the glaciers; however, as in Loch Tay, several of the islands appear to be crannogs, artificial islands built in prehistoric periods.

English travel writer, H.V. Morton wrote:
Writing 150 years earlier than Morton, Samuel Johnson had however been less impressed by Loch Lomond&#x27;s islands, writing:
==Flora and fauna==
The Scottish dock (&quot;Rumex aquaticus&quot;), sometimes called the Loch Lomond dock, is in Britain unique to the shores of Loch Lomond, being found mostly on around Balmaha on the eastern shore of the loch. It was first discovered growing there in 1936 (else it grows eastwards through Europe and Asia all the way to Japan).

Powan are one of the commonest fish species in the loch, which has more species of fish than any other loch in Scotland, including lamprey, lampern, brook trout, perch, loach, common roach and flounder. The river lamprey of Loch Lomond display an unusual behavioural trait not seen elsewhere in Britain: unlike other populations, in which young hatch in rivers before migrating to the sea, the river lamprey here remain in freshwater all their lives, hatching in the Endrick Water and migrating into the loch as adults.

The surrounding hills are home to species such as black grouse, ptarmigan, golden eagles, pine martens, red deer and mountain hares. Many species of wading birds and water vole inhabit the loch shore. During the winter months large numbers of geese migrate to Loch Lomond, including over 1% of the entire global population of Greenland white-fronted geese (around 200 individuals), and up to 3,000 greylag geese.

In January 2023 RSPB Scotland released a family of beavers into the southeastern area of the loch under licence from NatureScot. The beaver family, consisting of an adult pair and their five offspring, were translocated from a site in Tayside, where beaver activity was having a negative impact that could not be mitigated.

One of the loch&#x27;s islands, Inchconnachan, is home to a colony of red-necked wallabies.

==Conservation designations==
As well as forming part of the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park, Loch Lomond holds multiple other conservation designations. 428 ha of land in the southeast, including five of the islands, is designated as national nature reserve: the Loch Lomond National Nature Reserve. Seven islands and much of the shoreline form a Special Area of Conservation (SAC), the &quot;Loch Lomond Woods&quot;. This designation overlaps partially with the national nature reserve, and is protected due to the presence of Atlantic oak woodlands and a population of otters. Four islands and a section of the shoreline are designated as a Special Protection Area due to their importance for breeding capercaillie and visiting Greenland white-fronted geese: this designation overlaps partially with both the national nature reserve and the SAC. Loch Lomond is also a designated Ramsar site, again for the presence of Greenland white-fronted geese.

The loch and its surrounding are designated as a national scenic area, one of forty such areas in Scotland, which have been defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development.

==History==

People first arrived in the Loch Lomond area around 5000 years ago, during the neolithic era. They left traces of their presence at places around the loch, including Balmaha, Luss, and Inchlonaig. Crannogs, artificial islands used as dwellings for over five millennia, were built at points in the loch. The Romans built a double-row of defense forts within sight of the loch at Drumquhassle in the first century, and was built to protect themselves against the Highland tribes during their invasion of Scotland. Known as a “glen-blocker” fort, it dates back to the Flavian dynasty (69 – 96 AD). The crannog known as &quot;The Kitchen&quot;, located off the island of Clairinsh, may have later been used as a place for important meetings by Clan Buchanan whose clan seat had been on Clairinsh since 1225: this usage would be in line with other crannogs such as that at Finlaggan on Islay, used by Clan Donald.

During the Early Medieval period viking raiders sailed up Loch Long, hauled their longboats over at the narrow neck of land at Tarbet, and sacked several islands in the loch.

The area surrounding the loch later become part of the province of Lennox, which covered much of the area of the later county of Dunbartonshire.

Loch Lomond became a popular destination for travellers, such that when James Boswell and Samuel Johnson visited the islands of Loch Lomond on the return from their tour of the Western Isles in 1773, the area was already firmly enough established as a destination for Boswell to note that it would be unnecessary to attempt any description.

==Leisure activities==
===Boating and watersports===

Loch Lomond is one of Scotland&#x27;s premier boating and watersports venues, with visitors enjoying activities including kayaking, Canadian canoeing, paddle boarding, wake boarding, water skiing and wake surfing. The national park authority has tried to achieve a balance between land-based tourists and loch users, with environmentally sensitive areas subject to a strictly enforced speed limit, but the rest of the loch open to speeds of up to .

The &quot;Maid of the Loch&quot; was the last paddle steamer built in Britain. Built on the Clyde in 1953, she operated on Loch Lomond for 29 years. She is now being restored at Balloch pier by the Loch Lomond Steamship Company, a charitable organisation, supported by West Dunbartonshire Council. Cruises also operate from Balloch, Tarbet, Inversnaid, Luss and Rowardennan.

Loch Lomond Rescue Boat provides 24-hour safety cover on the loch. The rescue boat is a volunteer organisation and a registered charity. The national park authority also have other boats on the loch such as &quot;The Brigadier&quot;. Police Scotland also operates on the loch using RIBs and jet skis and work in conjunction with the national park authority.

The loch has served as the venue for the Great Scottish Swim, which is held each year in August.

===Angling===
Fly and coarse fishing on Loch Lomond is regulated by the Loch Lomond Angling Improvement Association (LLAIA), who issue permits to members and visiting anglers. The association employ water bailiffs to monitor the actions of anglers on the loch and ensure angling is carried out in accordance with permit conditions.

===Land-based activities===
Loch Lomond Golf Club is situated on the south-western shore. It has hosted many international events including the Scottish Open. Another golf club, &quot;The Carrick&quot; has opened on the banks of the Loch adjacent to the Loch Lomond Club.

The West Highland Way runs along the eastern bank of the loch, and Inveruglas on the western bank is the terminus of the Loch Lomond and Cowal Way. The West Loch Lomond Cycle Path runs from Arrochar and Tarbet railway station, at the upper end of the loch, to Balloch railway station, at the south end. The long cycle path runs along the west bank.

At the southern end of the loch near Balloch is a large visitor and shopping complex named Loch Lomond Shores.

===Access and camping===
As with all land and inland water in Scotland there is a right of responsible access to the loch and its shoreline for those wishing to participate in recreational pursuits such as walking, camping, swimming and canoeing. In 2017 the national park authority introduced byelaws restricting the right to camp along much of the shoreline of Loch Lomond, due to issues such as litter and anti-social behaviour that were blamed on irresponsible campers. Camping is now restricted to designated areas, and campers are required to purchase a permit to camp within these areas between March and October. The byelaws were opposed by groups such as Mountaineering Scotland and Ramblers Scotland, who argued that they would criminalise camping even where it was carried out responsibly, and that the national park authority already had sufficient powers to address irresponsible behaviour using existing laws.

== Transport ==

The main arterial route along the loch is the A82 road which runs the length of its western shore, following the general route of the Old Military Road. The road runs along the shoreline in places, but generally keeps some distance to the west of the loch in the &quot;lowland&quot; section to the south. Much of the southern section of the road was widened to a high quality single carriageway standard over the 1980s, at an estimated cost of £24 million (£ million as of ), while Luss itself is now bypassed to the west of the village along a single carriageway bypass constructed between 1990 and 1992. At Tarbet, the A83 branches west to Campbeltown while the A82 continues to the north end of the loch. This part of the road is currently of a lower standard than the sections further south. It is sandwiched between the shoreline of the loch and the mountains to the west, and it runs generally alongside the West Highland Line. The road narrows to less than in places and causes significant problems for heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), which have to negotiate tight bends and the narrow carriageway width. At Pulpit rock, the road was single-track, with traffic flow controlled by traffic lights for over 30 years. The road was widened in 2015 as part of a £9 million improvement programme, including a new viaduct bringing the carriageway width to modern standards.

The A811 runs to the south of Loch Lomond between Balloch and Drymen, following the route of another military road at a distance of between 2 and 3 kilometres from the loch. From Drymen the B837 extends north, meeting the eastern shore of the loch at Balmaha where the road terminates. A minor road extends north as far as Rowardennan, a further 11 km away, however beyond this point no road continues along the eastern shore, although there is road access to Inversnaid via another minor road that comes in from Loch Katrine to the east via the northern shore of Loch Arklet. As Loch Arklet is over 100 m above Loch Lomond and less than 2 km to the east this road must descend steeply to reach Inversnaid.

The West Highland railway line joins the western shore of the loch just north of Arrochar and Tarbet railway station. There is a further station alongside the loch at Ardlui. This line was voted the top rail journey in the world by readers of independent travel magazine &quot;Wanderlust&quot; in 2009, ahead of the iconic Trans-Siberian line in Russia and the Cuzco to Machu Picchu line in Peru. The railway system also reaches the loch at Balloch railway station, which is the terminus of the North Clyde Line.

Several different operators offer ferry services on the loch.

Since 2004 &quot;Loch Lomond Seaplanes&quot; operates an aerial tour service from its seaplane base near Cameron.

On 22 April 1940, a BOAC Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra (&quot;Loch Invar&quot;, registration G-AFKD) aircraft flying from Perth Airport to Heston Aerodrome in London crashed at Loch Lomond, killing all five passengers and crew.

==Hydroelectricity==

The Loch Sloy Hydro-Electric Scheme is situated on the west bank of Loch Lomond. The facility is operated by Scottish and Southern Energy, and is normally in standby mode, ready to generate electricity to meet sudden peaks in demand. It is the largest conventional hydro electric power station in the UK, with an installed capacity of 152.5 MW, and can reach full-capacity within 5 minutes from a standing start. The hydraulic head between Loch Sloy and the outflow into Loch Lomond at Inveruglas is 277 m.

==In popular culture==
===Song===
The loch is featured in a well-known song which was first published around 1841. The chorus is:

:Oh, ye&#x27;ll tak the high road, and I&#x27;ll tak the low road,
:And I&#x27;ll be in Scotland afore ye;
:But me and my true love will never meet again
:On the bonnie, bonnie banks o&#x27; Loch Lomond.

The song has been recorded by many performers over the years. The original author is unknown. One story is that the song was written by a Scottish soldier who awaited death in enemy captivity; in his final letter home, he wrote this song, portraying his home and how much he would miss it. Another tale is that during the Jacobite rising of 1745 a soldier on his way back to Scotland during the 1745–46 retreat from England wrote this song. The &quot;low road&quot; may be a reference to the Celtic belief that if someone died away from his homeland, then the fairies would provide a route of this name for his soul to return home. Within this theory, it is possible that the soldier awaiting death may have been writing either to a friend who was allowed to live and return home, or to a lover back in Scotland.

<text>In psychology, decision-making (also spelled decision making and decisionmaking) is regarded as the cognitive process resulting in the selection of a belief or a course of action among several possible alternative options. It could be either rational or irrational. The decision-making process is a reasoning process based on assumptions of values, preferences and beliefs of the decision-maker. Every decision-making process produces a final choice, which may or may not prompt action.

Research about decision-making is also published under the label problem solving, particularly in European psychological research.

==Overview==
Decision-making can be regarded as a problem-solving activity yielding a solution deemed to be optimal, or at least satisfactory. It is therefore a process which can be more or less rational or irrational and can be based on explicit or tacit knowledge and beliefs. Tacit knowledge is often used to fill the gaps in complex decision-making processes. Usually, both of these types of knowledge, tacit and explicit, are used together in the decision-making process.

Human performance has been the subject of active research from several perspectives:
* Psychological: examining individual decisions in the context of a set of needs, preferences and values the individual has or seeks.
* Cognitive: the decision-making process is regarded as a continuous process integrated in the interaction with the environment.
* Normative: the analysis of individual decisions concerned with the logic of decision-making, or communicative rationality, and the invariant choice it leads to.

A major part of decision-making involves the analysis of a finite set of alternatives described in terms of evaluative criteria. Then the task might be to rank these alternatives in terms of how attractive they are to the decision-maker(s) when all the criteria are considered simultaneously. Another task might be to find the best alternative or to determine the relative total priority of each alternative (for instance, if alternatives represent projects competing for funds) when all the criteria are considered simultaneously. Solving such problems is the focus of multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). This area of decision-making, although long established, has attracted the interest of many researchers and practitioners and is still highly debated as there are many MCDA methods which may yield very different results when they are applied to exactly the same data. This leads to the formulation of a decision-making paradox. Logical decision-making is an important part of all science-based professions, where specialists apply their knowledge in a given area to make informed decisions. For example, medical decision-making often involves a diagnosis and the selection of appropriate treatment. But naturalistic decision-making research shows that in situations with higher time pressure, higher stakes, or increased ambiguities, experts may use intuitive decision-making rather than structured approaches. They may follow a recognition-primed decision that fits their experience, and arrive at a course of action without weighing alternatives.

The decision-maker&#x27;s environment can play a part in the decision-making process. For example, environmental complexity is a factor that influences cognitive function. A complex environment is an environment with a large number of different possible states which come and go over time. Studies done at the University of Colorado have shown that more complex environments correlate with higher cognitive function, which means that a decision can be influenced by the location. One experiment measured complexity in a room by the number of small objects and appliances present; a simple room had less of those things. Cognitive function was greatly affected by the higher measure of environmental complexity, making it easier to think about the situation and make a better decision.

== Problem solving vs. decision making ==
It is important to differentiate between problem solving, or problem analysis, and decision-making. Problem solving is the process of investigating the given information and finding all possible solutions through invention or discovery. Traditionally, it is argued that problem solving is a step towards decision making, so that the information gathered in that process may be used towards decision-making.

; Characteristics of problem solving:
* Problems are merely deviations from performance standards.
* Problems must be precisely identified and described
* Problems are caused by a change from a distinctive feature
* Something can always be used to distinguish between what has and has not been affected by a cause
* Causes of problems can be deduced from relevant changes found in analyzing the problem
* Most likely cause of a problem is the one that exactly explains all the facts, while having the fewest (or weakest) assumptions (Occam&#x27;s razor).

; Characteristics of decision-making:
* Objectives must first be established
* Objectives must be classified and placed in order of importance
* Alternative actions must be developed
* The alternatives must be evaluated against all the objectives
* The alternative that is able to achieve all the objectives is the tentative decision
* The tentative decision is evaluated for more possible consequences
* The decisive actions are taken, and additional actions are taken to prevent any adverse consequences from becoming problems and starting both systems (problem analysis and decision-making) all over again
* There are steps that are generally followed that result in a decision model that can be used to determine an optimal production plan
* In a situation featuring conflict, role-playing may be helpful for predicting decisions to be made by involved parties
* When participants do not agree on what the future will look like, Decision-making Under Deep Uncertainty may play a role. 

===Analysis paralysis===
When a group or individual is unable to make it through the problem-solving step on the way to making a decision, they could be experiencing analysis paralysis. Analysis paralysis is the state that a person enters where they are unable to make a decision, in effect paralyzing the outcome. Some of the main causes for analysis paralysis is the overwhelming flood of incoming data or the tendency to overanalyze the situation at hand. There are said to be three different types of analysis paralysis.
* The first is analysis process paralysis. This type of paralysis is often spoken of as a cyclical process. One is unable to make a decision because they get stuck going over the information again and again for fear of making the wrong decision.
* The second is decision precision paralysis. This paralysis is cyclical, just like the first one, but instead of going over the same information, the decision-maker will find new questions and information from their analysis and that will lead them to explore into further possibilities rather than making a decision.
* The third is risk uncertainty paralysis. This paralysis occurs when the decision-maker wants to eliminate any uncertainty but the examination of provided information is unable to get rid of all uncertainty.

=== Extinction by instinct ===
On the opposite side of analysis paralysis is the phenomenon called extinction by instinct. Extinction by instinct is the state that a person is in when they make careless decisions without detailed planning or thorough systematic processes. Extinction by instinct can possibly be fixed by implementing a structural system, like checks and balances into a group or one&#x27;s life. Analysis paralysis is the exact opposite where a group&#x27;s schedule could be saturated by too much of a structural checks and balance system.

Groupthink is another occurrence that falls under the idea of extinction by instinct. Groupthink is when members in a group become more involved in the &quot;value of the group (and their being part of it) higher than anything else&quot;; thus, creating a habit of making decisions quickly and unanimously. In other words, a group stuck in groupthink is participating in the phenomenon of extinction by instinct.

===Information overload===
Information overload is &quot;a gap between the volume of information and the tools we have to assimilate&quot; it. Information used in decision-making is to reduce or eliminate the uncertainty. Excessive information affects problem processing and tasking, which affects decision-making. Psychologist George Armitage Miller suggests that humans&#x27; decision making becomes inhibited because human brains can only hold a limited amount of information. Crystal C. Hall and colleagues described an &quot;illusion of knowledge&quot;, which means that as individuals encounter too much knowledge, it can interfere with their ability to make rational decisions. Other names for information overload are information anxiety, information explosion, infobesity, and infoxication.

=== Decision fatigue ===

Decision fatigue is when a sizable amount of decision-making leads to a decline in decision-making skills. People who make decisions in an extended period of time begin to lose mental energy needed to analyze all possible solutions. Impulsive decision-making and decision avoidance are two possible paths that extend from decision fatigue. Impulse decisions are made more often when a person is tired of analysis situations or solutions; the solution they make is to act and not think. Decision avoidance is when a person evades the situation entirely by not ever making a decision. Decision avoidance is different from analysis paralysis because this sensation is about avoiding the situation entirely, while analysis paralysis is continually looking at the decisions to be made but still unable to make a choice.

===Post-decision analysis===
Evaluation and analysis of past decisions is complementary to decision-making. See also mental accounting and Postmortem documentation.

== Neuroscience ==

Decision-making is a region of intense study in the fields of systems neuroscience, and cognitive neuroscience. Several brain structures, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), orbitofrontal cortex, and the overlapping ventromedial prefrontal cortex are believed to be involved in decision-making processes. A neuroimaging study found distinctive patterns of neural activation in these regions depending on whether decisions were made on the basis of perceived personal volition or following directions from someone else. Patients with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex have difficulty making advantageous decisions.

A common laboratory paradigm for studying neural decision-making is the two-alternative forced choice task (2AFC), in which a subject has to choose between two alternatives within a certain time. A study of a two-alternative forced choice task involving rhesus monkeys found that neurons in the parietal cortex not only represent the formation of a decision but also signal the degree of certainty (or &quot;confidence&quot;) associated with the decision. A 2012 study found that rats and humans can optimally accumulate incoming sensory evidence, to make statistically optimal decisions. Another study found that lesions to the ACC in the macaque resulted in impaired decision-making in the long run of reinforcement guided tasks suggesting that the ACC may be involved in evaluating past reinforcement information and guiding future action. It has recently been argued that the development of formal frameworks will allow neuroscientists to study richer and more naturalistic paradigms than simple 2AFC decision tasks; in particular, such decisions may involve planning and information search across temporally extended environments.

=== Emotions ===

Emotion appears able to aid the decision-making process. Decision-making often occurs in the face of uncertainty about whether one&#x27;s choices will lead to benefit or harm (see also Risk). The somatic marker hypothesis is a neurobiological theory of how decisions are made in the face of uncertain outcomes. This theory holds that such decisions are aided by emotions, in the form of bodily states, that are elicited during the deliberation of future consequences and that mark different options for behavior as being advantageous or disadvantageous. This process involves an interplay between neural systems that elicit emotional/bodily states and neural systems that map these emotional/bodily states. A recent lesion mapping study of 152 patients with focal brain lesions conducted by Aron K. Barbey and colleagues provided evidence to help discover the neural mechanisms of emotional intelligence.

== Decision-making techniques ==

Decision-making techniques can be separated into two broad categories: group decision-making techniques and individual decision-making techniques. Individual decision-making techniques can also often be applied by a group.

===Group===
* Consensus decision-making tries to avoid &quot;winners&quot; and &quot;losers&quot;. Consensus requires that a majority approve a given course of action, but that the minority agree to go along with the course of action. In other words, if the minority opposes the course of action, consensus requires that the course of action be modified to remove objectionable features.
* Voting-based methods:
** Majority requires support from more than 50% of the members of the group. Thus, the bar for action is lower than with consensus. See also Condorcet method.
** Plurality, where the largest faction in a group decides, even if it falls short of a majority.
** Score voting (or range voting) lets each member score one or more of the available options, specifying both &quot;preference&quot; and &quot;intensity of preference&quot; information. The option with the highest total or average is chosen. This method has experimentally been shown to produce the lowest Bayesian regret among common voting methods, even when voters are strategic. It addresses issues of voting paradox and majority rule. See also approval voting.
** Quadratic voting allows participants to cast their &quot;preference&quot; and &quot;intensity of preference&quot; for each decision (as opposed to a simple &quot;for&quot; or &quot;against&quot; decision). As in score voting, it addresses issues of voting paradox and majority rule.
* Delphi method is a structured communication technique for groups, originally developed for collaborative forecasting but has also been used for policy making.
* Dotmocracy is a facilitation method that relies on the use of special forms called Dotmocracy. They are sheets that allows large groups to collectively brainstorm and recognize agreements on an unlimited number of ideas they have each wrote.
* Participative decision-making occurs when an authority opens up the decision-making process to a group of people for a collaborative effort.
* Decision engineering uses a visual map of the decision-making process based on system dynamics and can be automated through a decision modeling tool, integrating big data, machine learning, and expert knowledge as appropriate.

===Individual===
* Decisional balance sheet: listing the advantages and disadvantages (benefits and costs, pros and cons) of each option, as suggested by Plato&#x27;s &quot;Protagoras&quot; and by Benjamin Franklin.
* Expected-value optimization: choosing the alternative with the highest probability-weighted utility, possibly with some consideration for risk aversion. This may involve considering the opportunity cost of different alternatives. See also Decision analysis and Decision theory.
* Satisficing: examining alternatives only until the first acceptable one is found. The opposite is maximizing or optimizing, in which many or all alternatives are examined in order to find the best option.
* Acquiesce to a person in authority or an &quot;expert&quot;; &quot;just following orders&quot;.
* Anti-authoritarianism: taking the most opposite action compared to the advice of mistrusted authorities.
* Flipism e.g. flipping a coin, cutting a deck of playing cards, and other random or coincidence methodsor prayer, tarot cards, astrology, augurs, revelation, or other forms of divination, superstition or pseudoscience.
* Automated decision support: setting up criteria for automated decisions.
* Decision support systems: using decision-making software when faced with highly complex decisions or when considering many stakeholders, categories, or other factors that affect decisions.
* Decision coaching refers to support given by a health-care professionals to assist a person when making a health-related or medical-related decision. Decision coaching is an active process where the health professional and the patient are active in the decision making process.

== Steps ==
A variety of researchers have formulated similar prescriptive steps aimed at improving decision-making.

===GOFER===
In the 1980s, psychologist Leon Mann and colleagues developed a decision-making process called GOFER, which they taught to adolescents, as summarized in the book &quot;Teaching Decision Making To Adolescents&quot;. The process was based on extensive earlier research conducted with psychologist Irving Janis. GOFER is an acronym for five decision-making steps:

# Goals clarification: Survey values and objectives.
# Options generation: Consider a wide range of alternative actions.
# Facts-finding: Search for information.
# Consideration of Effects: Weigh the positive and negative consequences of the options.
# Review and implementation: Plan how to review the options and implement them.

===Other===

In 2007, Pam Brown of Singleton Hospital in Swansea, Wales, divided the decision-making process into seven steps:

# Outline the goal and outcome.
# Gather data.
# Develop alternatives (i.e., brainstorming).
# List pros and cons of each alternative.
# Make the decision.
# Immediately take action to implement it.
# Learn from and reflect on the decision.

In 2008, Kristina Guo published the DECIDE model of decision-making, which has six parts:
# Define the problem
# Establish or Enumerate all the criteria (constraints)
# Consider or Collect all the alternatives
# Identify the best alternative
# Develop and implement a plan of action
# Evaluate and the solution and examine feedback when necessary

In 2009, professor John Pijanowski described how the Arkansas Program, an ethics curriculum at the University of Arkansas, used eight stages of moral decision-making based on the work of James Rest:
# Establishing community: Create and nurture the relationships, norms, and procedures that will influence how problems are understood and communicated. This stage takes place prior to and during a moral dilemma.
# Perception: Recognize that a problem exists.
# Interpretation: Identify competing explanations for the problem, and evaluate the drivers behind those interpretations.
# Judgment: Sift through various possible actions or responses and determine which is more justifiable.
# Motivation: Examine the competing commitments which may distract from a more moral course of action and then prioritize and commit to moral values over other personal, institutional or social values.
# Action: Follow through with action that supports the more justified decision.
# Reflection in action.
# Reflection on action.

===Group stages===

There are four stages or phases that should be involved in all group decision-making:
* Orientation. Members meet for the first time and start to get to know each other.
* Conflict. Once group members become familiar with each other, disputes, little fights and arguments occur. Group members eventually work it out.
* Emergence. The group begins to clear up vague opinions by talking about them.
* Reinforcement. Members finally make a decision and provide justification for it.

It is said that establishing critical norms in a group improves the quality of decisions, while the majority of opinions (called consensus norms) do not.

Conflicts in socialization are divided in to functional and dysfunctional types. Functional conflicts are mostly the questioning the managers assumptions in their decision making and dysfunctional conflicts are like personal attacks and every action which decrease team effectiveness. Functional conflicts are the better ones to gain higher quality decision making caused by the increased team knowledge and shared understanding.

== Rational and irrational ==

In economics, it is thought that if humans are rational and free to make their own decisions, then they would behave according to rational choice theory. Rational choice theory says that a person consistently makes choices that lead to the best situation for themselves, taking into account all available considerations including costs and benefits; the rationality of these considerations is from the point of view of the person themselves, so a decision is not irrational just because someone else finds it questionable.

In reality, however, there are some factors that affect decision-making abilities and cause people to make irrational decisionsfor example, to make contradictory choices when faced with the same problem framed in two different ways (see also Allais paradox).

Rational decision making is a multi-step process for making choices between alternatives. The process of rational decision making favors logic, objectivity, and analysis over subjectivity and insight. Irrational decision is more counter to logic. The decisions are made in haste and outcomes are not considered.

One of the most prominent theories of decision making is subjective expected utility (SEU) theory, which describes the rational behavior of the decision maker. The decision maker assesses different alternatives by their utilities and the subjective probability of occurrence.

Rational decision-making is often grounded on experience and theories that are able to put this approach on solid mathematical grounds so that subjectivity is reduced to a minimum, see e.g. scenario optimization.

Rational decision is generally seen as the best or most
likely decision to achieve the set goals or outcome.

== Children, adolescents, and adults ==

===Children===
It has been found that, unlike adults, children are less likely to have research strategy behaviors. One such behavior is adaptive decision-making, which is described as funneling and then analyzing the more promising information provided if the number of options to choose from increases. Adaptive decision-making behavior is somewhat present for children, ages 11–12 and older, but decreases in presence the younger they are. The reason children are not as fluid in their decision making is because they lack the ability to weigh the cost and effort needed to gather information in the decision-making process. Some possibilities that explain this inability are knowledge deficits and lack of utilization skills. Children lack the metacognitive knowledge necessary to know when to use any strategies they do possess to change their approach to decision-making.

When it comes to the idea of fairness in decision making, children and adults differ much less. Children are able to understand the concept of fairness in decision making from an early age. Toddlers and infants, ranging from 9–21 months, understand basic principles of equality. The main difference found is that more complex principles of fairness in decision making such as contextual and intentional information do not come until children get older.

===Adolescents===

During their adolescent years, teens are known for their high-risk behaviors and rash decisions. Research has shown that there are differences in cognitive processes between adolescents and adults during decision-making. Researchers have concluded that differences in decision-making are not due to a lack of logic or reasoning, but more due to the immaturity of psychosocial capacities that influence decision-making. Examples of their undeveloped capacities which influence decision-making would be impulse control, emotion regulation, delayed gratification and resistance to peer pressure. In the past, researchers have thought that adolescent behavior was simply due to incompetency regarding decision-making. Currently, researchers have concluded that adults and adolescents are both competent decision-makers, not just adults. However, adolescents&#x27; competent decision-making skills decrease when psychosocial capacities become present.

Research has shown that risk-taking behaviors in adolescents may be the product of interactions between the socioemotional brain network and its cognitive-control network. The socioemotional part of the brain processes social and emotional stimuli and has been shown to be important in reward processing. The cognitive-control network assists in planning and self-regulation. Both of these sections of the brain change over the course of puberty. However, the socioemotional network changes quickly and abruptly, while the cognitive-control network changes more gradually. Because of this difference in change, the cognitive-control network, which usually regulates the socioemotional network, struggles to control the socioemotional network when psychosocial capacities are present.

When adolescents are exposed to social and emotional stimuli, their socioemotional network is activated as well as areas of the brain involved in reward processing. Because teens often gain a sense of reward from risk-taking behaviors, their repetition becomes ever more probable due to the reward experienced. In this, the process mirrors addiction. Teens can become addicted to risky behavior because they are in a high state of arousal and are rewarded for it not only by their own internal functions but also by their peers around them. A recent study suggests that adolescents have difficulties adequately adjusting beliefs in response to bad news (such as reading that smoking poses a greater risk to health than they thought), but do not differ from adults in their ability to alter beliefs in response to good news. This creates biased beliefs, which may lead to greater risk taking.

===Adults===
Adults are generally better able to control their risk-taking because their cognitive-control system has matured enough to the point where it can control the socioemotional network, even in the context of high arousal or when psychosocial capacities are present. Also, adults are less likely to find themselves in situations that push them to do risky things. For example, teens are more likely to be around peers who peer pressure them into doing things, while adults are not as exposed to this sort of social setting.

== Cognitive and personal biases ==

Biases usually affect decision-making processes. They appear more when decision task has time pressure, is done under high stress and/or task is highly complex.

Here is a list of commonly debated biases in judgment and decision-making:
* Selective search for evidence (also known as confirmation bias): People tend to be willing to gather facts that support certain conclusions but disregard other facts that support different conclusions. Individuals who are highly defensive in this manner show significantly greater left prefrontal cortex activity as measured by EEG than do less defensive individuals.
* Premature termination of search for evidence: People tend to accept the first alternative that looks like it might work.
* Cognitive inertia is the unwillingness to change existing thought patterns in the face of new circumstances.
* Selective perception: People actively screen out information that they do not think is important (see also Prejudice). In one demonstration of this effect, discounting of arguments with which one disagrees (by judging them as untrue or irrelevant) was decreased by selective activation of right prefrontal cortex.
* Wishful thinking is a tendency to want to see things in a certainusually positivelight, which can distort perception and thinking.
* Choice-supportive bias occurs when people distort their memories of chosen and rejected options to make the chosen options seem more attractive.
* Recency: People tend to place more attention on more recent information and either ignore or forget more distant information (see Semantic priming). The opposite effect in the first set of data or other information is termed &quot;primacy effect&quot;.
* Repetition bias is a willingness to believe what one has been told most often and by the greatest number of different sources.
* Anchoring and adjustment: Decisions are unduly influenced by initial information that shapes our view of subsequent information.
* Groupthink is peer pressure to conform to the opinions held by the group.
* Source credibility bias is a tendency to reject a person&#x27;s statement on the basis of a bias against the person, organization, or group to which the person belongs. People preferentially accept statements by others that they like (see also Prejudice).
* Incremental decision-making and escalating commitment: People look at a decision as a small step in a process, and this tends to perpetuate a series of similar decisions. This can be contrasted with &quot;zero-based decision-making&quot; (see Slippery slope).
* Attribution asymmetry: People tend to attribute their own success to internal factors, including abilities and talents, but explain their failures in terms of external factors such as bad luck. The reverse bias is shown when people explain others&#x27; success or failure.
* Role fulfillment is a tendency to conform to others&#x27; decision-making expectations.
* Underestimating uncertainty and the illusion of control: People tend to underestimate future uncertainty because of a tendency to believe they have more control over events than they really do.
* Framing bias: This is best avoided by increasing numeracy and presenting data in several formats (for example, using both absolute and relative scales).
** Sunk-cost fallacy is a specific type of framing effect that affects decision-making. It involves an individual making a decision about a current situation based on what they have previously invested in the situation. An example of this would be an individual that is refraining from dropping a class that they are most likely to fail, due to the fact that they feel as though they have done so much work in the course thus far.
* Prospect theory involves the idea that when faced with a decision-making event, an individual is more likely to take on a risk when evaluating potential losses, and are more likely to avoid risks when evaluating potential gains. This can influence one&#x27;s decision-making depending if the situation entails a threat, or opportunity.
* Optimism bias is a tendency to overestimate the likelihood of positive events occurring in the future and underestimate the likelihood of negative life events. Such biased expectations are generated and maintained in the face of counter-evidence through a tendency to discount undesirable information. An optimism bias can alter risk perception and decision-making in many domains, ranging from finance to health.
* Reference class forecasting was developed to eliminate or reduce cognitive biases in decision-making.

== Cognitive limitations in groups ==

In groups, people generate decisions through active and complex processes. One method consists of three steps: initial preferences are expressed by members; the members of the group then gather and share information concerning those preferences; finally, the members combine their views and make a single choice about how to face the problem. Although these steps are relatively ordinary, judgements are often distorted by cognitive and motivational biases, include &quot;sins of commission&quot;, &quot;sins of omission&quot;, and &quot;sins of imprecision&quot;.

== Cognitive styles ==

===Optimizing vs. satisficing===
Herbert A. Simon coined the phrase &quot;bounded rationality&quot; to express the idea that human decision-making is limited by available information, available time and the mind&#x27;s information-processing ability. Further psychological research has identified individual differences between two cognitive styles: &quot;maximizers&quot; try to make an optimal decision, whereas &quot;satisficers&quot; simply try to find a solution that is &quot;good enough&quot;. Maximizers tend to take longer making decisions due to the need to maximize performance across all variables and make tradeoffs carefully; they also tend to more often regret their decisions (perhaps because they are more able than satisficers to recognize that a decision turned out to be sub-optimal).

===Intuitive vs. rational===
The psychologist Daniel Kahneman, adopting terms originally proposed by the psychologists Keith Stanovich and Richard West, has theorized that a person&#x27;s decision-making is the result of an interplay between two kinds of cognitive processes: an automatic intuitive system (called &quot;System 1&quot;) and an effortful rational system (called &quot;System 2&quot;). System 1 is a bottom-up, fast, and implicit system of decision-making, while system 2 is a top-down, slow, and explicit system of decision-making. System 1 includes simple heuristics in judgment and decision-making such as the affect heuristic, the availability heuristic, the familiarity heuristic, and the representativeness heuristic.

===Combinatorial vs. positional===

Styles and methods of decision-making were elaborated by Aron Katsenelinboigen, the founder of predispositioning theory. In his analysis on styles and methods, Katsenelinboigen referred to the game of chess, saying that &quot;chess does disclose various methods of operation, notably the creation of predisposition-methods which may be applicable to other, more complex systems.&quot;

Katsenelinboigen states that apart from the methods (reactive and selective) and sub-methods randomization, predispositioning, programming), there are two major styles: positional and combinational. Both styles are utilized in the game of chess. The two styles reflect two basic approaches to uncertainty: deterministic (combinational style) and indeterministic (positional style). Katsenelinboigen&#x27;s definition of the two styles are the following.

The combinational style is characterized by:
* a very narrow, clearly defined, primarily material goal; and
* a program that links the initial position with the outcome.

In defining the combinational style in chess, Katsenelinboigen wrote: &quot;The combinational style features a clearly formulated limited objective, namely the capture of material (the main constituent element of a chess position). The objective is implemented via a well-defined, and in some cases, unique sequence of moves aimed at reaching the set goal. As a rule, this sequence leaves no options for the opponent. Finding a combinational objective allows the player to focus all his energies on efficient execution, that is, the player&#x27;s analysis may be limited to the pieces directly partaking in the combination. This approach is the crux of the combination and the combinational style of play.

The positional style is distinguished by:
* a positional goal; and
* a formation of semi-complete linkages between the initial step and final outcome.

&quot;Unlike the combinational player, the positional player is occupied, first and foremost, with the elaboration of the position that will allow him to develop in the unknown future. In playing the positional style, the player must evaluate relational and material parameters as independent variables. ... The positional style gives the player the opportunity to develop a position until it becomes pregnant with a combination. However, the combination is not the final goal of the positional playerit helps him to achieve the desirable, keeping in mind a predisposition for the future development. The pyrrhic victory is the best example of one&#x27;s inability to think positionally.&quot;

The positional style serves to:
* create a predisposition to the future development of the position;
* induce the environment in a certain way;
* absorb an unexpected outcome in one&#x27;s favor; and
* avoid the negative aspects of unexpected outcomes.

===Influence of Myers–Briggs type===

According to Isabel Briggs Myers, a person&#x27;s decision-making process depends to a significant degree on their cognitive style. Myers developed a set of four bi-polar dimensions, called the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). The terminal points on these dimensions are: &quot;thinking&quot; and &quot;feeling&quot;; &quot;extroversion&quot; and &quot;introversion&quot;; &quot;judgment&quot; and &quot;perception&quot;; and &quot;sensing&quot; and &quot;intuition&quot;. She claimed that a person&#x27;s decision-making style correlates well with how they score on these four dimensions. For example, someone who scored near the thinking, extroversion, sensing, and judgment ends of the dimensions would tend to have a logical, analytical, objective, critical, and empirical decision-making style. However, some psychologists say that the MBTI lacks reliability and validity and is poorly constructed.

Other studies suggest that these national or cross-cultural differences in decision-making exist across entire societies. For example, Maris Martinsons has found that American, Japanese and Chinese business leaders each exhibit a distinctive national style of decision-making.

The Myers–Briggs typology has been the subject of criticism regarding its poor psychometric properties.

=== General decision-making style (GDMS) ===
In the general decision-making style (GDMS) test developed by Suzanne Scott and Reginald Bruce, there are five decision-making styles: rational, intuitive, dependent, avoidant, and spontaneous. These five different decision-making styles change depending on the context and situation, and one style is not necessarily better than any other. In the examples below, the individual is working for a company and is offered a job from a different company.
* The &quot;rational&quot; style is an in-depth search for, and a strong consideration of, other options and/or information prior to making a decision. In this style, the individual would research the new job being offered, review their current job, and look at the pros and cons of taking the new job versus staying with their current company.
* The &quot;intuitive&quot; style is confidence in one&#x27;s initial feelings and gut reactions. In this style, if the individual initially prefers the new job because they have a feeling that the work environment is better suited for them, then they would decide to take the new job. The individual might not make this decision as soon as the job is offered.
* The &quot;dependent&quot; style is asking for other people&#x27;s input and instructions on what decision should be made. In this style, the individual could ask friends, family, coworkers, etc., but the individual might not ask all of these people.
* The &quot;avoidant&quot; style is averting the responsibility of making a decision. In this style, the individual would not make a decision. Therefore, the individual would stick with their current job.
* The &quot;spontaneous&quot; style is a need to make a decision as soon as possible rather than waiting to make a decision. In this style, the individual would either reject or accept the job as soon as it is offered.

<text>Health economics is a branch of economics concerned with issues related to efficiency, effectiveness, value and behavior in the production and consumption of health and healthcare. Health economics is important in determining how to improve health outcomes and lifestyle patterns through interactions between individuals, healthcare providers and clinical settings. In broad terms, health economists study the functioning of healthcare systems and health-affecting behaviors such as smoking, diabetes, and obesity.

One of the biggest difficulties regarding healthcare economics is that it does not follow normal rules for economics. Price and quality are often hidden by the third-party payer system of insurance companies and employers. Additionally, QALYs (Quality Adjusted Life Years), one of the most commonly used measurements for treatments, is very difficult to measure and relies upon assumptions that are often unreasonable.

A seminal 1963 article by Kenneth Arrow is often credited with giving rise to health economics as a discipline. His theory drew conceptual distinctions between health and other goods. Factors that distinguish health economics from other areas include extensive government intervention, intractable uncertainty in several dimensions, asymmetric information, barriers to entry, externality and the presence of a third-party agent. In healthcare, the third-party agent is the patient&#x27;s health insurer, who is financially responsible for the healthcare goods and services consumed by the insured patient.

Health economists evaluate multiple types of financial information: costs, charges and expenditures.

Uncertainty is intrinsic to health, both in patient outcomes and financial concerns. The knowledge gap that exists between a physician and a patient creates a situation of distinct advantage for the physician, which is called &quot;asymmetric information&quot;.

Externalities arise frequently when considering health and health care, notably in the context of the health impacts as with infectious disease or opioid abuse. For example, making an effort to avoid catching the common cold affects people other than the decision maker or finding sustainable, humane and effective solutions to the opioid epidemic.

==Scope==
The scope of health economics is neatly encapsulated by Alan Williams&#x27; &quot;plumbing diagram&quot; dividing the discipline into eight distinct topics:
* What influences health? (other than healthcare)
* What is health and what is its value?
* The demand for healthcare
* The supply of healthcare
* Micro-economic evaluation at treatment level
* Market equilibrium
* Evaluation at whole system level
* Planning, budgeting and monitoring mechanisms.
==History==
In the third century BC, Aristotle, an ancient Greek thinker, once talked about the relationship between farmers and doctors in production and exchange. In the 17th century, William Petty, a British classical economist, pointed out that the medical and health expenses spent on workers would bring economic benefits.

Presently, contemporary health economics stands as a prominent interdisciplinary field, connecting economic theory with healthcare practice; its diverse sub-disciplines and research domains are evident. The academic roots of this knowledge are commonly traced back to the U.S. tradition.

The American Medical Association (AMA) was created in 1848, having as main goals scientific advancement, creation of standards for medical education, launching a program of medical ethics, and obtaining improved public health. Yet, it was only in 1931 that economic concerns came to the agenda, with the creation of the AMA Bureau of Medical Economics, established to study all economic matters affecting the medical profession.

After the Second World War, amid the rapid improvement of the level of medical research technology, the modernization of diagnosis and treatment means and health facilities and equipment, the aging of the population, the sharp increase of chronic diseases, and the improvement of people&#x27;s demand for health care and other reasons, medical and health expenses increased significantly. For example, total U.S. health expenditures steadily increased as a share of gross domestic product (GDP), demonstrating the increased importance that society placed on health care relative to other non-health goods and services. Between 1960 and 2013, health spending as a share of GDP increased from 5.0 to 17.4 percent. Over the same period, the average annual growth in nominal national health expenditures was 9.2 percent compared to nominal GDP
growth of 6.7 percent.

At the same time, the expenditure on health care in many European countries also increased, accounting for about 4% of GDP in the 1950s and 8% by the end of the 1970s. In terms of growth rate, the proportion of health care expenditure in GNP (gross national product) in many countries increased by 1% in the 1950s, 1.5% in the 1960s, and 2% in the 1970s. This high medical and health expenditure was a heavy economic burden on government, business owners, workers, and families, which required a way to restrain its growth.

In addition, the scale of health service increased, technical equipment became more advanced, and division of labor and specialization saw increases, too. The medical and health service developed into a &quot;healthcare industry&quot; which occupies a considerable amount of capital and labor and occupies an important position in social and economic life. The research on economic problems of the health sector became an important topic of economic research.

Selma Muskin published &quot;Towards the definition of health economics&quot; in 1958 and, four years later, the paper, &quot;Health as an Investment&quot;. At that time, health was broadly regarded as rather a consumptive branch of the economy. Muhkin&#x27;s analysis was the first understanding that health investment had long-term beneficial consequences for the community. Probably, the single most famous and cited contribution to the discipline was Kenneth Arrow&#x27;s &quot;Uncertainty and the welfare economics of medical care&quot;, published in 1963.

After the 1960s, research in health economics developed further, and a second academic seminar on health economics was held in the United States in 1962 followed by a third in 1968. In 1968, the World Health Organization held its first international health economics seminar in Moscow. The convening of the three meetings showed that health economics had boarded an academic forum as an independent discipline, which also marked the official formation of health economics.

After the 1970s, the health economy entered a period of rapid development and nursing economics gradually emerged. In 1979, Paul Feldstein, an American health economist, first used the principles of economics to discuss the long-term care market, registered market, and other nursing economy issues, laying the foundation for the emergence of nursing economics.

In 1983, Nursing Economic Magazine was founded in the United States, and its main research content included nursing market development, nursing cost accounting, policies related to nursing services, nursing economic management, etc. The magazine&#x27;s publication was a mark of the formal formation of nursing economics. In 1993, The University of Iowa Cost Research Center conducted a systematic nursing cost study, simply the NIC System. The specific practice consisted of establishing a special research institution equipped with full-time researchers, sorting out the nursing cost accounting content, and, finally, identifying 433 items in 6 categories. At the same time, the Center adopted computer technology to carry out nursing cost management, including cost assessment, reasonable budget, decision making, etc., which played a crucial role in improving the efficiency of nursing management and alleviating the nursing management crisis.

==Healthcare demand==
The demand for healthcare is a derived demand from the demand for health. Healthcare is demanded as a means for consumers to achieve a larger stock of &quot;health capital&quot;. The demand for health is unlike most other goods because individuals allocate resources in order to both consume and produce health.

The above description gives three roles of persons in health economics. The World Health Report (p. 52) states that people take four roles in healthcare:
# Contributors
# Citizens
# Provider
# Consumers

Michael Grossman&#x27;s 1972 model of health production has been extremely influential in this field of study and has several unique elements that make it notable. Grossman&#x27;s model views each individual as both a producer and a consumer of health. Health is treated as a stock which degrades over time in the absence of &quot;investments&quot; in health, so that health is viewed as a sort of capital. The model acknowledges that health is both a consumption good that yields direct satisfaction and utility, and an investment good, which yields satisfaction to consumers indirectly through fewer sick days. Investment in health is costly as consumers must trade off time and resources devoted to health, such as exercising at a local gym, against other goals. These factors are used to determine the optimal level of health that an individual will demand. The model makes predictions over the effects of changes in prices of healthcare and other goods, labour market outcomes such as employment and wages, and technological changes. These predictions and other predictions from models extending Grossman&#x27;s 1972 paper form the basis of much of the econometric research conducted by health economists.

In Grossman&#x27;s model, the optimal level of investment in health occurs where the marginal cost of health capital is equal to the marginal benefit. With the passing of time, health depreciates at some rate formula_1. The interest rate faced by the consumer is denoted by formula_2. The marginal cost of health capital can be found by adding these variables: formula_3. The marginal benefit of health capital is the rate of return from this capital in both market and non-market sectors. In this model, the optimal health stock can be impacted by factors like age, wages and education. As an example, formula_4 increases with age, so it becomes more and more costly to attain the same level of health capital or health stock as one ages. Age also decreases the marginal benefit of health stock. The optimal health stock will therefore decrease as one ages.

Beyond issues of the fundamental, &quot;real&quot; demand for medical care derived from the desire to have good health (and thus influenced by the production function for health) is the important distinction between the &quot;marginal benefit&quot; of medical care (which is always associated with this &quot;real demand&quot; curve based on derived demand), and a separate &quot;effective demand&quot; curve, which summarizes the amount of medical care demanded at particular market prices. Because most medical care is not purchased from providers directly, but is rather obtained at subsidized prices due to insurance, the out-of-pocket prices faced by consumers are typically much lower than the market price. The consumer sets formula_5 out of pocket, and so the &quot;effective demand&quot; will have a separate relationship between price and quantity other than the &quot;marginal benefit curve&quot; or real demand relationship will have. This distinction is often described under the rubric of &quot;ex-post moral hazard&quot; (which is again distinct from ex-ante moral hazard, which is found in any type of market with insurance).

==Health technology assessment==

Economic evaluation, and in particular cost-effectiveness analysis, has become a fundamental part of technology appraisal processes for agencies in a number of countries. The Institute for Quality and Economy in Health Services (Institut für Qualität und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen – IQWiG) in Germany and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom, for example, both consider the cost-effectiveness of new pharmaceuticals entering the market.

Some agencies, including NICE, recommend the use of cost–utility analysis (CUA). This approach measures outcomes in a composite metric of both length and quality of life, the Quality-adjusted life year (QALY).

==Healthcare markets==
The five health markets typically analyzed are:
* Healthcare financing market
* Physician and nurses services market
* Institutional services market
* Input factors markets
* Professional education market

Although assumptions of textbook models of economic markets apply reasonably well to healthcare markets, there are important deviations. Many states have created risk pools in which relatively healthy enrollees subsidize the care of the rest. Insurers must cope with adverse selection which occurs when they are unable to fully predict the medical expenses of enrollees; adverse selection can destroy the risk pool. Features of insurance market risk pools, such as group purchases, preferential selection (&quot;cherry-picking&quot;), and preexisting condition exclusions are meant to cope with adverse selection.

Insured patients are naturally less concerned about healthcare costs than they would if they paid the full price of care. The resulting moral hazard drives up costs, as shown by the RAND Health Insurance Experiment. Insurers use several techniques to limit the costs of moral hazard, including imposing copayments on patients and limiting physician incentives to provide costly care. Insurers often compete by their choice of service offerings, cost-sharing requirements, and limitations on physicians.

Consumers in healthcare markets often lack adequate information about what services they need to buy and which providers offer the best value proposition. Health economists have documented a problem with supplier induced demand, whereby providers base treatment recommendations on economic, rather than medical criteria. Researchers have also documented substantial &quot;practice variations&quot;, whereby the treatment also on service availability to rein in inducement and practice variations.

Some economists argue that requiring doctors to have a medical license constrains inputs, inhibits innovation, and increases cost to consumers while largely only benefiting the doctors themselves.

==Arguments for intervention==
===Risk sharing===

Risk-sharing can reduce risk premiums, for example for research and development of new cures and health care equipment. 

===Health insurance failure===
Health insurance failure can be attributed to market failure or government failure. Underinsurance can arise when the cure of disease is very expensive, such as cancer or a wide spread of new diseases such as HIV/AIDS or COVID-19. In such cases either private insurers require a high premium as the risk factor and costs are high or they may not insure the people for a particular case. This leads to a void in the market where a certain section of the population will not be able to afford healthcare. Certain insurance markets, such as those for patients with HIV/AIDS, cancer, or other pre-existing conditions who are searching for new coverage, may be incomplete in the sense that those patients may be unable to afford coverage at any price. In such cases, the government usually intervenes and provides health care for such cases. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, no private insurance company predicted (or could have predicted) that such an outbreak would occur; as a result, state intervention became necessary to treat people. Governments can subsidize those who cannot afford insurance or, in certain situations, those low-cost activities and facilities that non-poor citizens can afford on their own. For example; the largest health insurance scheme in the world was launched in India by the name Ayushman Bharat in 2018.

===Monopoly in healthcare industry===

Government might want to intervene in case of market failure in healthcare industry. Several health-care markets tend to have the potential for monopoly control to be exercised. Medical care in markets with few hospitals, patent-protected prescription products, and some health insurance markets is the major reason for higher costs and especially in cases where the providers are private companies. Limitations on physician-owned hospitals are argued to reduce competition between hospitals.

==Health spending==

Lists of health spending by country:
* Health spending as percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by country 
* List of countries by total health expenditure per capita



==Medical economics==
Often used synonymously with health economics, &quot;medical economics&quot;, according to Culyer, is the branch of economics concerned with the application of economic theory to phenomena and problems associated typically with the second and third health market outlined above: physician and institutional service providers. Typically, however, it pertains to cost–benefit analysis of pharmaceutical products and cost-effectiveness of various medical treatments. Medical economics often uses mathematical models to synthesise data from biostatistics and epidemiology for support of medical decision-making, both for individuals and for wider health policy.

==Mental health economics==
Mental health economics incorporates a vast array of subject matters, ranging from pharmacoeconomics to labor economics and welfare economics. Mental health can be directly related to economics by the potential of affected individuals to contribute as human capital. In 2009 Currie and Stabile published &quot;Mental Health in Childhood and Human Capital&quot; in which they assessed how common childhood mental health problems may alter the human capital accumulation of affected children. Externalities may include the influence that affected individuals have on surrounding human capital, such as at the workplace or in the home. In turn, the economy also affects the individual, particularly in light of globalization. For example, studies in India, where there is an increasingly high occurrence of western outsourcing, have demonstrated a growing hybrid identity in young professionals who face very different sociocultural expectations at the workplace and in at home.

Mental health economics presents a unique set of challenges to researchers. Individuals with cognitive disabilities may not be able to communicate preferences. These factors represent challenges in terms of placing value on the mental health status of an individual, especially in relation to the individual&#x27;s potential as human capital. Further, employment statistics are often used in mental health economic studies as a means of evaluating individual productivity; however, these statistics do not capture &quot;presenteeism&quot;, when an individual is at work with a lowered productivity level, quantify the loss of non-paid working time, or capture externalities such as having an affected family member. Also, considering the variation in global wage rates or in societal values, statistics used may be contextually, geographically confined, and study results may not be internationally applicable.

Though studies have demonstrated mental healthcare to reduce overall healthcare costs, demonstrate efficacy, and reduce employee absenteeism while improving employee functioning, the availability of comprehensive mental health services is in decline. Petrasek and Rapin (2002) cite the three main reasons for this decline as (1) stigma and privacy concerns, (2) the difficulty of quantifying medical savings and (3) physician incentive to medicate without specialist referral. Evers et al. (2009) have suggested that improvements could be made by promoting more active dissemination of mental health economic analysis, building partnerships through policy-makers and researchers, and employing greater use of knowledge brokers.

== Health utility ==
Generally, economists assume that individuals act rationally with the aim of maximizing their lifetime utility, while all are subject to the fact that they cannot buy more than their resources allow. However, this model gets complex as there exists the uncertainty over individuals&#x27; lifetime. As such, the issue is split into two parts: 1. How does health produce utility and 2. What affects health (e.g., medical care and life-style choices).

Probably the most fundamental thing in consumer demand theory is that the good increases an individual&#x27;s utility. Health is not really a good in the traditional sense, but health in itself produces happiness. We can think of health as a durable good, much like for instance a car, a house or an education. Every person comes into the world with some inherent &quot;stock&quot; of health, and a healthy baby has a fairly high stock of health. Basically, every decision an individual take during their lifetime will affect their stock of health.

Let X be a bundle of other goods, and H a stock of health. With these variables the formula for an individual&#x27;s utility is: &quot;Utility = U(X, H).&quot; For simplicity, the stock of health produces utility, but technically, is the flow of services created by the stock of health that produces utility. As the traditional fashion for goods, &quot;more is better&quot;, in other words an increase in health leads to an increase in utility. From this assumption, X grows with health, for instance it is more enjoyable to visit the zoo when not experiencing a headache.

Like other durable goods, the stock of health wears out over time, much like other durable goods. This process can be called aging. When the stock of health has dropped low enough, a person will lose their ability to function. In economic terminology it can be said that the stock of health depreciates. Since life expectancy has risen a lot during this century, it implies that e.g., the depreciation rate has decreased during this time. Public healthcare efforts and individual medical care are in place to restore the stock of health or to decrease the depreciation rate on the stock of health. A plot graph of an individual&#x27;s stock of health throughout their lifetime would be steadily increasing in the beginning during their childhood, and after that gradually decline because of aging, meanwhile having sudden drops created by random events, such as injury or illness.

There are many other things than &quot;random&quot; health care events, which individuals consume or do during their lives that affect the speed of aging and the severity and frequency of the drops. Lifestyle choices can deeply improve or worsen health of an individual. The variable X, the bundle of goods and services, can undertake numerous characteristics, some add value while others noticeably decrease the stock of health. Outstanding among such lifestyle choices are the decision to consume alcohol, smoke tobacco, use drugs, composition of diet, amount of exercise and so on. Not only can X and H work as substitutes for one another in producing utility, but X can also affect H in a production sense as well. X can then be split into different categories depending on which effect it has on H, for instance &quot;good&quot; types (e.g., moderate exercise), &quot;bad&quot; types (e.g., food with high cholesterol) and &quot;neutral&quot; types (e.g., concerts and books). Neutral goods do not have an apparent effect on individuals&#x27; health.
