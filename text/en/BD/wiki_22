<text>Lunenburg is a town in Worcester County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 11,782 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Lunenburg was first settled by Europeans in 1718 and was officially incorporated in 1728. The name stems from one of the titles of King George II of Great Britain, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg. During King George&#x27;s War (1744–1748), French-allied First Nations, such as warriors of the M&#x27;iq Maq or Abenaki Confederacy, raided the village and took settlers captive to Quebec.

Areas of neighboring Fitchburg were once part of Lunenburg, but broke away around 1764. The settlers found the walking distance to church and town meetings too great and needed their own town center.

Whalom Park on Whalom Lake had long been a noted amusement park in Lunenburg during the 20th century. It was home of the famous Flyer Comet, now demolished. The park closed in 2000, unable to survive the competition with the newer and increasingly popular Six Flags New England in Agawam.

<text>Milford is a town in Worcester County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 30,379 according to the 2020 census. First settled in 1662 and incorporated in 1780, Milford became a booming industrial and quarrying community in the 19th century due to its unique location which includes the nearby source of the Charles River, the Mill River, the Blackstone River watershed, and large quantities of Milford pink granite.

==History==
Milford was first settled in 1662 as a part of Mendon after Native Americans, including the Sachem, Quashaamit, granted land to the early settlers. King Philip&#x27;s War destroyed the town in 1676, but settlers returned in 1680. The Mill River flows through Milford and had several conspicuous fords that were familiar to the Native Americans, and used by the early white settlers. These &quot;mill (river) fords&quot; are said to have given Milford its name. Milford was incorporated April 11, 1780, and the first town hall built in 1819; a brick structure later named the Town House School. The current town hall was built in 1854 by architect Thomas Silloway.

Milford is renowned for its Milford pink granite, discovered in 1870. Milford quarries fueled the local economy until about 1940. The granite has been used for local buildings such as Memorial Hall; the Bancroft Memorial Library in Hopedale; Worcester City Hall; and the Boston Public Library. Other notable buildings include the original Pennsylvania Station in New York City; the main post office in New York City; and more recently the Singapore Changi Airport in 2002.

The Milford Hospital was donated in 1903 by Governor Eben Sumner Draper. Today, the health care facility exists as the Milford Regional Medical Center. In January 2008, the Center opened a cancer treatment facility with the Dana–Farber Cancer Institute. The center is affiliated with UMass Medical Center as a teaching hospital. In 2015 the hospital completed a $54-million expansion project that created a new emergency department and updated the intensive care unit, as well as patient rooms.

<text>Oxford is a town in Worcester County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 13,347 as of the 2020 United States Census.

==History==

=== Pre-Colonial Era ===
Present day Oxford and the areas surrounding it were inhabited for thousands of years before European colonization. Although archaeological sites exist in Central Massachusetts dating back to the Paleoindian period (12,000-9000 years before present) there are much more abundant archaeological remains starting in the period from 6500 to 3000 years before present, including an arrowhead identified in Oxford Massachusetts. An arrowhead collected at an archaeological site in Oxford has been radiocarbon dated to 2990 ± 155 years before present.

=== Contact Era ===
At the time of English colonization in the early and mid-1600s, the area was inhabited by the Pegan subgroup of the Nipmuc people, whom the English attempted to convert to Christianity. To this end, out of unceded Nipmuc lands, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in New England created the praying town of Manchaug in the early 1670s, which included present day Oxford in its bounds. In 1674 around 60 native people lived in Manchaug, however residents fled the town during King Phillip&#x27;s War when praying towns were targeted by both colonial and Wampanoag war parties: for example, despite their neutrality in the conflict, in 1676 the neighboring Nipmuc praying town of Chaubunagungamaug was attacked by the colonial militia and 52 people were killed or captured.

After King Philip&#x27;s War, neighboring Chaubunagungamaug was the only inhabited Nipmuc praying town, and in 1681-1682 the constable of Chaubunagungamaug, known as Black James, acting on behalf of the Nipmuc Praying Indians (though not their non-Christianized counterparts), signed a deed selling large tracts of land in the Chaubunagungamaug and Manchaug to investors including Joseph Dudley in Roxbury and Robert Thompson in London. This sale included the present day town of Oxford. 

=== Colonial Era ===
Oxford was first colonized intermittently by Europeans in 1687, with several breaks during the French and Indian Wars, and was officially incorporated in 1713. 

In 1687, Robert Thompson arranged for a group of 52 French Huguenots he had connected with in London to colonize the land recently purchased from Black James. During this early period the Huguenot settlement grew to about 70 individuals, while Native settlements remained in the area numbering around 40 families.

In 1694, the Huguenot colonists built the Huguenot Fort out of concern for conflict with local Native Americans after the outbreak of hostilities between the Massachusetts colony and the Wabanaki Confederacy in King William&#x27;s War. The original settlement was abandoned after four residents (John Johnson and his three children, Peter, Andrew and Mary) were killed in a violent confrontation with local Native Americans. This event, the &quot;Johnson Massacre,&quot; is commemorated near the south end of town on Main Street. The remains of the Huguenot Fort still exist near Huguenot Road.

From 1699 to 1704 the Huguenot settlers attempted to return to the settlement but it was abandoned again during Queen Anne&#x27;s War. 

The English investors who received the deed from Black James in 1682 continued to try to recruit settlers to the Oxford area, and by 1720, a group of around 30 English families had founded a new church there with a new minister.

The first town clerk of Oxford was John Town, who also served as selectman and as a church deacon.

Oxford was the birthplace of Clara Barton, the first president and founder of the American Red Cross. 

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.20%, is water. The town sits in a valley, and much of its area lies in the flood plain of the French River, which runs through the town. A substantial parcel north and west of Oxford Center is held, for flood control purposes, by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The land, known as Greenbriar, also serves as a nature preserve.

It also serves to cut off east–west travel on former roads through the site. Route 20 runs east–west through North Oxford, running
north–south Route 12, locally called Main Street; less than a mile from Route 56, connecting North Oxford with points north; and Interstate 395, linking Oxford to Worcester and eastern Connecticut with three local exits: Depot Road in North Oxford; Sutton Avenue, the main east–west street in Oxford Center; and Cudworth Road, near the Webster town line.

The town used to include much of what is now Webster, on its southern border, but Oxford and neighboring Dudley both gave portions of their land to allow the creation of that town. Other towns bordering Oxford are Charlton to the west, Leicester and Auburn to the north, Millbury and Sutton to the east, and Douglas to the southeast.

<text>Spencer is a town in Worcester County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 11,992 at the 2020 census.

For geographic and demographic information on the census-designated place Spencer, please see the article Spencer (CDP), Massachusetts.

==History==
Spencer was first settled in 1717 by Nathaniel Wood, and first permanently settled by Samuel Bemis in 1721.

Spencer is located in central Worcester County, twenty minutes west of Worcester via Route 9, and about forty-five east of Springfield via Routes 49, 20, and the Massachusetts Turnpike. It was officially incorporated on April 12, 1753, splitting from the town of Leicester. Spencer was named after the then-acting governor of Massachusetts, Spencer Phips. Spencer was the home of the Howe family of inventors, including Elias Howe, who perfected the lockstitch sewing machine.

In 1784, Spencer was a major stopping place on the Old Boston Post Road&#x27;s stage route between Boston and Hartford, and on to New York. Passengers changed stages in Spencer, as one coach would come from Boston and connect with one coming north from Hartford. Each stagecoach would turn around and return whence it came. Travelers often stopped for the night at Jenk&#x27;s Tavern in Spencer, as did General Henry Knox, pushing his cannons through the streets of the town on his way to Boston from Ticonderoga, and George Washington in 1789. Spencer still has colonial-era milestone markers showing the route of the old post road.

When the War of Independence broke out in 1775 it found Spencer ready to take part; fifty-six men under Captain Ebenezer Mason immediately set out to Boston. Many of these men later took part in the Battle of Bunker Hill. A total of 313 Spencer men are known to have served in the Civil War; thirty-two lost their lives in the service of their country.

Spencer&#x27;s first mill was built in 1740 on the Seven Mile River, the greatest source of waterpower in the town. In 1811, Josiah Green began making shoes, and in 1834 he built a factory. The Prouty family began to make shoes in 1820, and built their factory in 1855. In 1812, Elliot Prouty had begun to &quot;draw&quot; wire in a mill he had built. His business flourished in his family until 1916, when it merged with Wickwire Steel Co. At one time, Spencer had 11 factories and 26 buildings for wire drawing.

In 1839 the town hall was constructed, and eighteen years later, Denny Hall, the town&#x27;s first high school, was built. In 1888–1889, four prominent citizens (David Prouty, Richard Sugden, Luther Hill and Nathaniel Myrick) presented the town with a new high school, a library, a public park and the Spencer Agricultural Fair Grounds. The Howe family of Spencer did much to make the town famous in the annals of ingenious Americans. William Howe of Spencer developed a wooden truss bridge named for him, and his brother, Tyler Howe, patented a spring bed. Their nephew, Elias Howe, Jr., may well have eclipsed them when he invented the lockstitch sewing machine.

Spencer is home to Saint Joseph&#x27;s Abbey, a cloistered Roman Catholic monastery of monks of the Cistercian Order of the Strict Observance, popularly known as Trappists. They support the order through their three industries: the Holy Rood Guild, which makes a variety of liturgical garments (vestments) and linens; and Trappist Preserves, jams and jellies sold in retail outlets and at their gift shop in the Porter&#x27;s Lodge; and Spencer Trappist Ale (the first and only certified Trappist beer made in the U.S.In May 2022, St. Joseph&#x27;s Abbey ceased beer production and closed Spencer Brewery.

===2007 public water lye accident===
On April 25, 2007, it was discovered early in the morning that there was a malfunction at one of the town&#x27;s water treatment facilities where a hazardous amount of sodium hydroxide (lye) was released into the town&#x27;s water supply. The official cause was a malfunction of the system due to operator error, that regulates the amount of lye released. According to local news reports, dozens of people received medical treatment for &quot;burning sensations and skin rashes&quot;.

=== 2023 church fire ===
The First Congregational Church in Spencer was destroyed by fire following a lightning strike.

Sturbridge was first visited by the English Puritans in 1644 when John Winthrop the Younger visited the area now known as Tantiusques. Winthrop II bought the land from Tantasqua (local area sachem) and mined graphite, lead, and iron. The mine stayed in the Winthrop family as late as 1784 and was in operation until 1910. Sturbridge was first settled by the English in 1729 by settlers from Medfield, and was officially incorporated in 1738.

<text>Warren is a town in Worcester County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 4,975 at the 2020 census. The town contains the villages of Warren and West Warren.

== History ==
Warren was first settled in 1664 and was officially incorporated on January 16, 1741, as the town of Western.

Originally a part of Quaboag Plantation, the town now known as Warren was part of Brookfield for 68 years until it was renamed Western. Warren includes land petitioned from both the Quaboag Plantation and the &quot;Kingsfield&quot;, which included parts of Palmer and Brimfield.

On March 13, 1834, the town was renamed Warren in honor of General Joseph Warren, who died at the Battle of Bunker Hill during the American Revolutionary War. The need to rename the town came about due to confusion of the name &quot;Western&quot; with the town of Weston, Massachusetts. According to the &quot;History of Warren Massachusetts&quot; by Olney I. Darling, Western was renamed Warren due to &quot;countless mistakes in the transmission of the mails.&quot; On January 13, 1834, a town meeting was held to discuss a name change. Shortly thereafter, the town petitioned the legislature to change the name, which was soon done, and the first town meeting under the name &quot;Warren&quot; was held on April 28, 1834.

Two other places named &quot;Warren&quot; had existed in Massachusetts prior to 1834. The first Warren, now in Rhode Island, was located on land combining parts of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and Plymouth Colony. In 1636, Roger Williams, banished from Salem, fled to the Indian village of Sowams, where he was sheltered by Massasoit until he settled at Providence.

Permanent English settlement east of the Indian village began. In 1653, Massasoit and his oldest son sold to certain Plymouth Colony settlers what is now Warren and parts of Barrington, Rhode Island, Swansea, Massachusetts, and Rehoboth, Massachusetts. In 1668, the township was officially incorporated with the name Sowams;[3] in 1691, the Plymouth Colony merged with the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Warren was ceded to Rhode Island from Massachusetts in 1747. The town was named &quot;Warren&quot; after a British naval hero, Admiral Sir Peter Warren, following a victory at Louisburg in 1745. At the time of cession in 1747, Barrington was unified with Warren, until it was separated again in 1770.

The second &quot;Warren, Massachusetts&quot; is now the town of Warren, Maine. On November 7, 1776, Upper Town of St. Georges Plantation was incorporated as a town and named after Joseph Warren, the Revolutionary War hero. Maine separated from Massachusetts in 1820.

Warren in Worcester County historically contained the villages of #4 Village, Center Village, West Warren, Lower Village, and South Warren. Historical markers mark each of these areas, and West Warren and Warren each have their own zip codes.

<text>Winchendon ( ), nicknamed Toy Town, is a town in Worcester County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 10,364 at the 2020 census. The town includes the villages of Waterville and Winchendon Springs (also known as Spring Village). A census-designated place, also named Winchendon, is defined within the town for statistical purposes. The Winchendon State Forest, a 174.5 acres (70.62 hectares) parcel, is located within the township as is Otter River State Forest; both recreational areas are managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation.

==History==

Winchendon is a small town in north-central Massachusetts, originally the country of the Pennacook Indians, and then the Nipnet/Nipmuck tribe.

The House of Representatives made the grant of New Ipswich Canada, now Winchendon, on June 10, 1735, in answer to a petition from Lt. Abraham Tilton of Ipswich. The petition was on behalf of veterans or surviving heirs participating in the 1690 expeditions against Canada. Winchendon was officially incorporated in 1764, named after Nether Winchendon, Buckinghamshire, England, which itself was the site of land owned by Governor Francis Bernard, who signed the town&#x27;s incorporation into law. (The English village would be where the Governor would die, fifteen years later.) The Millers River provided water power for mills, and at one time Winchendon produced so many wooden shingles that it was nicknamed Shingletown.

Morton E. Converse started his business career in Converseville, New Hampshire, manufacturing acids. In 1873, he purchased a nearby mill to make wooden products. Apparently he started making toys there, but soon teamed with Orland Mason of Winchendon to form the Mason &amp; Converse Company, which lasted until 1883. Converse then partnered with his uncle, Alfred C. Converse, and Converse Toy &amp; Woodenware Company was formed. In 1887, the company changed its name to Morton E. Converse &amp; Company. It remained in business until 1934 having been under the stewardship of Atherton D. Converse.

Converse made a great variety of toys, including Noah&#x27;s Arks, doll furniture, kiddie riding racers, hobby horses, floor whirligigs, drums, wagon blocks, building blocks, pianos, trunks, ten pins, farm houses, and musical roller chimes. Such a large number of toys were made in Winchendon that it became known as Toy Town.

The original Giant Rocking Horse was built in 1912 by Morton Converse. The grey hobby horse was named Clyde, and made from nine pine trees. It was a copy of the company&#x27;s #12 rocking horse. In 1914, Clyde entered the local parade to celebrate the town&#x27;s 150th anniversary. Clyde was moved to the railroad station for about 20 years. Then in 1934, he moved to the edge of the Toy Town Tavern for about 30 years. After that, he was put in storage and fell into disrepair. A replica, Clyde II, was sculpted in 1988 by Winchendon native Sherman LaBarge, using the original as a model. He is now on display in a covered pavilion.

=== Spring Village ===

In addition to the manufacturing of wood products, Winchendon is known for its textile business during the Industrial Revolution. Located at the headwaters of the Millers River, Joseph &#x27;Deacon&#x27; White of West Boylston, Massachusetts, with his son Nelson, purchased a textile mill in Spring Village in 1843. By 1857, the Nelson Mills had revamped a previous facility. In 1870, Joseph N. White, son of Nelson, traveled to Canada to recruit additional workers from Quebec. Spring Village became a prototype &#x27;company town&#x27; with jobs, housing and a school for its workers. A second mill was built in 1887 and was known as the Glenallan Mill. The business thrived during the last half of the 19th and first half of the 20th centuries. As the south was modernized during the 1930s, textile operations in New England migrated south. Both World War II and the Korean War demands for denim were instrumental in keeping White Brothers, Inc. in business; the organization ceased operations in 1956 due to economic pressures from industrialization of the south.

==Geography ==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.77%, is water. Winchendon is drained by the Millers River. Winchendon is home to the Lake Dennison Recreation Area and Whitney Pond, and shares Lake Monomonac with Rindge, New Hampshire to the north. Along the path of the Millers River, in the western part of town, much of the land is marshy, with several brooks feeding into both the Millers River and the nearby Otter River, which flows into the Millers River in the southwest corner of town. The town lies on relatively flat high ground, with the western slope of Town Line Hill (1,320 ft) being the highest point in town, near the southeast corner of town. Two protected areas, the Birch Hill Wildlife Management Area and the Otter River State Forest, both have part of their lands within the town, as well as the small Winchendon State Forest.

Winchendon is the middle town of the three Worcester County towns bordering New Hampshire&#x27;s Cheshire County. It is bounded by Fitzwilliam and Rindge to the north, Ashburnham to the east, Gardner to the southeast, Templeton to the southwest, and Royalston to the west. From its town center, Winchendon is northwest of Fitchburg, southeast of Keene, New Hampshire, north-northwest of Worcester and northwest of Boston.
== Transportation==

Winchendon has no interstate or limited access highways within town; the nearest is Route 2, the major east-west route through the northern part of the state, in Templeton and Gardner. U.S. Route 202 passes through the town before heading into New Hampshire. Route 12 also passes through the town, from Ashburnham towards Fitzwilliam and Keene. The northern terminus of Route 140 is also within town, at its intersection with Route 12. This intersection was improved around the turn of the 21st century to include stoplights, in order to make it safer (as it had been a common site for accidents within town). When Route 140 was rerouted to bypass the Town of Gardner in the 1970s, Winchendon&#x27;s status as a bedroom community was facilitated by easy access to Route 2 and points east toward Greater Boston, I-495 and I-95.

The Boston &amp; Albany Railroad had an important junction in town; the former station was location on Central and Railroad Streets. Freight service ended in the 1980s when successor Guilford Rail System abandoned the line, which followed Route 12 for much of its route.

A line of the Montachusett Regional Transit Authority (MART) links the town with Gardner (and, in the mornings, directly with Fitchburg). There is no air service within town; the nearest small airport is Gardner Municipal Airport in Templeton, and the nearest national air service is located at Manchester-Boston Regional Airport in New Hampshire.

==Demographics==


As of the census of 2000, there were 9,611 people, 3,447 households, and 2,478 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 3,660 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 95.96% White, 0.80% Black or African American, 0.30% Native American, 0.62% Asian, 0.07% Pacific Islander, 0.95% from other races, and 1.29% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.03% of the population.

There were 3,447 households, out of which 39.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.3% were married couples living together, 11.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.1% were non-families. 22.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.75 and the average family size was 3.23.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 30.2% under the age of 18, 6.6% from 18 to 24, 32.0% from 25 to 44, 20.7% from 45 to 64, and 10.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females, there were 98.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 94.9 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $43,750, and the median income for a family was $50,086. Males had a median income of $36,875 versus $29,099 for females. The per capita income for the town was $18,798. About 6.8% of families and 10.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 10.6% of those under age 18 and 19.3% of those age 65 or over. The local senior high is Murdock High School.

==Library==

The Winchendon public library began in 1867. In 1907, the library trustees approached philanthropist Andrew Carnegie to fund a new facility; when Carnegie declined to increase his funding from $12,500 to $25,000, Charles L. Beals, a local businessman, presented the Selectman of Winchendon a check for $25,000 to fund a new library. In fiscal year 2008, the town of Winchendon spent 0.62% ($149,399) of its budget on its public library—approximately $14 per person, per year ($18.69 adjusted for inflation to 2022).

<doc id="259529" wikidata="Q1424745" url="?curid=259529" title="Saltatory conduction">
<text>In neuroscience, saltatory conduction () is the propagation of action potentials along myelinated axons from one node of Ranvier to the next, increasing the conduction velocity of action potentials. The uninsulated nodes of Ranvier are the only places along the axon where ions are exchanged across the axon membrane, regenerating the action potential between regions of the axon that are insulated by myelin, unlike electrical conduction in a simple circuit.

==Mechanism==
Myelinated axons only allow action potentials to occur at the unmyelinated nodes of Ranvier that occur between the myelinated internodes. It is by this restriction that saltatory conduction propagates an action potential along the axon of a neuron at rates significantly higher than would be possible in unmyelinated axons (150 m/s compared from 0.5 to 10 m/s). As sodium rushes into the node it creates an electrical force which pushes on the ions already inside the axon. This rapid conduction of electrical signal reaches the next node and creates another action potential, thus refreshing the signal. In this way, electrical nerve signals can propagate rapidly, over long distances, without degradation. Although the action potential appears to jump along the axon, this phenomenon is actually just the rapid conduction of the signal inside the myelinated portion of the axon.
If the entire surface of an axon were insulated, action potentials could not be regenerated along the axon resulting in signal degradation. In the CNS, nerve cells have been shown to individually alter the size of the nodes to tune conduction speeds.

==Energy efficiency==

In addition to increasing the speed of the nerve impulse, the myelin sheath helps in reducing energy expenditure over the axon membrane as a whole, because the amount of sodium and potassium ions that need to be pumped to bring the concentrations back to the resting state following each action potential is decreased.

==Distribution==

Saltatory conduction occurs widely in the myelinated nerve fibers of vertebrates, but was later discovered in a pair of medial myelinated giant fibers of &quot;Fenneropenaeus chinensis&quot; and &quot;Marsupenaeus japonicus&quot; shrimp, as well as in a median giant fiber of an earthworm. Saltatory conduction has also been found in the small- and medium-sized myelinated fibers of &quot;Penaeus&quot; shrimp.

==History of research==
In 1925 Ralph S. Lillie proposed the mechanism of saltatory conduction after experimenting with an iron wire model of the nerve, after covering the wire with isolated sections akin to myelinated internodes he observed a faster and &quot;saltatory&quot; conduction.

In 1939, Ichiji Tasaki confirmed saltatory conduction through experiments on isolated single-nerve fibers of the Japanese Toad. Tasaki was experimenting with anaesthetics and noticed a lack of conduction when three or more nodes were anesthetized, leading to his hypothesis. During World War II, Tasaki was not able to publish in American journals and had to send manuscripts to Germany via the Siberian railroad. He only heard of their publication after the war ended.

Lillie&#x27;s hypothesis was also confirmed by Andrew Huxley and Robert Stämpfli in peripheral myelinated nerve fibers in 1949 through experiments with isolated frog nerves. Bernhard Frankenhaeuser proved that this was true in undissected frog nerves as well, ending scholarly debate.

West Bloomfield is sometimes referred to by its residents as the &quot;lake township of Oakland County&quot;, due to it being heavily dotted with small and medium-sized lakes.

In addition, directly west of Pine Lake is Orchard Lake, which also has a private country club on its shore. Orchard Lake is surrounded by the city of Orchard Lake Village. Several smaller lakes are scattered around these larger ones.

Orchard Lake Road runs north–south through the middle of the township and is the main artery of West Bloomfield&#x27;s economy along with West Maple Road (15 Mile Rd.), flanked on each side by long strip malls and shopping complexes. There are many high-end boutique stores and expensive restaurants to visit. Most of the township&#x27;s population growth has occurred since the 1960s, as many residents moved there from the inner ring Detroit suburbs. West Bloomfield is located in south-central Oakland County about to the northwest from the Detroit city limits and has borders with Bloomfield Township to its east, Farmington Hills to its south, Commerce Township to its west, and four communities to its north: Waterford Township, Orchard Lake Village, Keego Harbor, and Sylvan Lake. The communities of West Bloomfield, Orchard Lake Village, Keego Harbor, and Sylvan Lake make up what is known as Greater West Bloomfield.

<text>Meredith is a town in Belknap County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 6,662 at the 2020 census. Meredith is situated in the state&#x27;s Lakes Region and serves as a major resort town. Meredith Village, the commercial center of the town, lies along the shores of Lake Winnipesaukee, and several other large lakes lie partially or completely within the town borders. It is home to the Stonedam Island Natural Area and the Winnipesaukee Scenic Railroad, and it serves as one of the ports of call for the .

Meredith Village, where 2,527 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined as the Meredith census-designated place, and is located at the junction of U.S. Route 3 and New Hampshire Route 25 at the head of Meredith Bay on Lake Winnipesaukee.

==History==
Meredith was first known as &quot;Palmer&#x27;s Town&quot; in honor of Samuel Palmer, a teacher of surveying and navigation who laid out much of the land surrounding Lake Winnipesaukee. In 1748, it was one of the first towns to have a charter granted by the Masonian Proprietors. Many grantees were from Salem, Massachusetts, so Palmer&#x27;s Town was renamed &quot;New Salem&quot;. It was settled in 1766 by Jacob Eaton and Colonel Ebenezer Smith, then regranted in 1768 by Governor John Wentworth and named after Sir William Meredith, 3rd Baronet, a member of Parliament who opposed taxation on the colonies.

Farmers grew corn, wheat, rye and potatoes, but the area became noted for apple orchards.

The water rights to the natural Measly Pond Brook (a.k.a. Corliss Brook) was purchased by John Jenness in 1795, and used to power a gristmill and sawmill in Meredith Village, though it was not the best local waterpower source. The brook drained Lake Waukewan into Lake Winnipesauke.

In 1800, John Bond Swasey inherited a farm which covered most of what is now Meredith Village. After his marriage in 1809, he gradually purchased land on both sides of the Measly Pond Brook, related water rights, and several mills.

From 1816 to 1818, Swasey constructed a rock-lined canal that redirected the flow from Lake Waukewan, and created a drop at a single rock-lined sluiceway at what is now the Mill Falls Marketplace. The new, more powerful waterfall ran sawmills, gristmills, cotton mills, and in 1895, the Meredith Electric Light Company.

By 1859 Meredith village had a sawmill, gristmill, shingle mill, blacksmith shop, harness-maker&#x27;s shop and tannery. Situated at the outlet of Wickwas Lake, Meredith Center had a sawmill, gristmill and blacksmith shop. Connected by the Boston, Concord &amp; Montreal Railroad in March 1849, the town became a summer resort. Passengers also arrived from the Alton Bay depot aboard steamboats, the most famous of which was the original SS &quot;Mount Washington&quot;, launched in 1872. Meredith remains a popular tourist destination.

In 1974, the Swasey family donated land to create Swasey Park on Lake Waukewan near the beginning of the canal.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and , or 26.37%, are water. The highest point in Meredith is the summit of Leavitt Mountain, elevation above sea level, in the southwestern part of town.

Meredith village is the commercial hub of the town, lying between the northern tip of Meredith Bay (one of several large arms of Lake Winnipesaukee) and Lake Waukewan. A second village, Meredith Center, is located near the shores of Lake Wickwas closer to the geographic center of the town. Meredith Center has much less commercial development than Meredith Village, being located near several protected state forests and wildlife areas.

The town is crossed by U.S. Route 3, New Hampshire Route 25, New Hampshire Route 104, and New Hampshire Route 106. It is bordered by the towns of Sanbornton to the southwest, New Hampton to the west, Center Harbor to the north, Moultonborough to the northeast across Lake Winnipesaukee, Gilford to the southeast, and Laconia to the south.

Like many other towns of the Lakes Region, Meredith is dominated by several large bodies of water. About half of the town&#x27;s southeastern boundary with its neighbor Laconia is occupied by Lake Winnisquam, while the northern half of town lies within a peninsula, Meredith Neck, that separates Meredith Bay from the main body of Lake Winnipesaukee, giving Meredith an extensive coastline. Bear Island, the second largest on Winnipesaukee, and Stonedam Island, along with dozens of smaller islands are also part of the town. Several smaller lakes lie between Winnipesaukee and Winnisquam, including Wickwas Lake and Pemigewasset Lake. Lake Waukewan forms the western edge of the Meredith Village CDP and extends into neighboring New Hampton.

<text>Conway is a town in Carroll County, New Hampshire, United States. It is the most populous community in the county, with a population of 9,822 at the 2020 census, down from 10,115 at the 2010 census. The town is on the southeastern edge of the White Mountain National Forest. There are five villages in the town: Conway, North Conway, Center Conway, Redstone and Kearsarge. Additionally, it shares a portion of the village of Intervale with the neighboring town of Bartlett.

Conway serves as the main economic and commercial hub for Carroll County. Tourism remains Conway&#x27;s biggest economic engine, with numerous lodging and rental properties serving visitors to the eastern White Mountains and the Mount Washington Valley, while the technology sector makes up the second largest source of employment. Sites of interest in the town include natural sites such as Cathedral Ledge (popular with climbers), Echo Lake and Conway Lake, as well as several nearby ski resorts. The Conway Scenic Railroad provides day trips to various locations. The village of North Conway features a popular outlet shopping district.

== History ==
The region was once home to the Pequawket Indians, an Algonquian Abenaki tribe. Along the Saco River they fished, hunted or farmed, and lived in wigwams sheltered within stockades. In 1642, explorer Darby Field of Exeter paddled up the Saco in a canoe, and reported seeing &quot;Pigwacket,&quot; an Indian community stretching from present-day Conway to Fryeburg, Maine. The Pequawket tribe dwindled from disease, probably smallpox brought from abroad. In May 1725, during Dummer&#x27;s War, 36 men from Dunstable, Massachusetts led by John Lovewell skirmished with the Pequawket. The Pequawket losses are not known but the result of the day&#x27;s battle was the withdrawal of the tribe from the area.

In 1765, colonial Governor Benning Wentworth chartered sixty-five men to establish &quot;Conway&quot;, named for Henry Seymour Conway, who was later named Commander in Chief of the British Army. To keep his land, a settler had to plant for every fifty in his share, and to do it within five years. The first roads were built in 1766. Construction of the first meetinghouse began at Redstone. Never completed, it could only be used in summer, with services held whenever a minister visited. Eventually, the partly finished meetinghouse was moved to Center Conway. In 1775, the town raised small sums to build two schoolhouses, one in North Conway. By 1849, however, the town had twenty school districts.

By the middle-19th century, artists had discovered the romantic beauties of the White Mountains, and &quot;Artist Falls Brook&quot; became a favorite setting for landscape paintings. King Edward VII of the United Kingdom bought twelve White Mountain paintings to hang in Windsor Castle. Among the artists to work here were Asher B. Durand and Benjamin Champney, the latter known to paint Mount Washington while sitting in the middle of Main Street.
The Portsmouth, Great Falls and Conway Railroad entered Conway in 1871. The railroad was bought by the Boston &amp; Maine, and joined in town by rival Maine Central. They transported freight, mostly wood and wood products, away from Conway, and they brought tourists. Numerous inns and taverns were built in the 19th and 20th centuries, and tourism remains today a principal business. The first ski trail began operating in 1936 at Mount Cranmore, where Hannes Schneider of Austria provided instruction starting in 1939. In 1959, the Kancamagus Highway opened, connecting Conway with Lincoln. It travels through Kancamagus Pass, named for a Pennacook chief, and at above sea level is the highest paved through-road in New Hampshire.

Since the 1930s, the population of the nearby city of Berlin has decreased significantly, from 20,018 in 1930 to 10,051 in 2010. This decline, coupled with the population increase in Conway and the surrounding community, has led to higher levels of economic development in the Conway area than the rest of northern New Hampshire. Conway has both a tourism-based economy and service economy. As of 2002, the largest employer in the town was Memorial Hospital, employing 350 people, followed by the Conway School District, Hannaford Bros. Co., Red Jacket Resorts, and Walmart.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 3.14% of the town. Conway is drained by the Saco River and its tributary, the Swift River. The highest point in the town is Black Cap at above sea level.

<text>Wolfeboro is a town in Carroll County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 6,416 at the 2020 census. A resort area situated beside Lake Winnipesaukee, Wolfeboro includes the village of Wolfeboro Falls.

==History==
The town was granted by colonial Governor Benning Wentworth in 1759 to four young men of Portsmouth, and named &quot;Wolfeborough&quot; in honor of English General James Wolfe, who had been victorious at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in 1759 during the French and Indian War. In 1763, were added to the reserved for the governor. Colonial Governor John Wentworth, Benning Wentworth&#x27;s nephew, established an estate on the site, known as Kingswood. Built in 1771 beside what is now called Lake Wentworth, this was the first summer country estate in northern New England. Settled in 1768, the town was incorporated in 1770.

Over the years Wolfeboro, whose town motto is &quot;The Oldest Summer Resort in America&quot;, became a popular summer colony, particularly for families from Boston and southern New Hampshire. Prince Rainier and Princess Grace of Monaco, Kurt Vonnegut, Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon have spent time in Wolfeboro. In August 2007, then French president Nicolas Sarkozy vacationed there.

In May 2014, it was discovered that 82-year-old police commissioner Robert Copeland had been overheard in a cafe two months earlier using a racial epithet to refer to then President Barack Obama. Copeland acknowledged in an email to his colleagues that he did in fact use the word, saying &quot;for this, I do not apologize — he meets and exceeds my criteria for such.&quot; At a subsequent meeting with residents, Copeland refused calls for his resignation. A few days later, he submitted his resignation.

It was named for Colonel Ebenezer Hinsdale, member of a prominent Deerfield, Massachusetts, family, whose mother had been taken captive in the famed Raid on Deerfield of 1704. Graduated from Harvard, Hinsdale was ordained to become a missionary for Indians of the Connecticut River Valley. Instead, he would serve as chaplain at Fort Dummer, an important trading post on the Connecticut River, later enlisting as an officer in the army. Then, in 1742, he established Fort Hinsdale, including a trading post and gristmill, reportedly at his own expense. The town&#x27;s earliest history recounts Indian assaults, raids and captivities.

Located beside the Connecticut River and connected to Brattleboro, Vermont, by bridge, Hinsdale contains excellent farmland, but has been a significant center of industry as well, especially in the manufacture of paper. In a machine shop here, George A. Long built a self-propelled steam vehicle in 1875, the Long steam tricycle, for which he received one of the nation&#x27;s earliest automobile patents. The Hinsdale post office, located on Main Street, is the oldest continually-operating in the same building post office in the United States.

From 1959 to 2008, the town was home to the Hinsdale Greyhound Park. In 2023, Geoffrey Holt, a caretaker of a mobile home park, left the town $3.8 million to be used for education, health, recreation, and culture.

<text>Jaffrey is a town in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 5,320 at the 2020 census.

The main village in town, where 3,058 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined as the Jaffrey census-designated place (CDP) and is located along the Contoocook River at the junction of U.S. Route 202 and New Hampshire routes 124 and 137.

==History==

First granted by the Massachusetts General Court in 1736 to soldiers from Rowley, Massachusetts, returning from the war in Canada, the town was known as &quot;Rowley-Canada&quot;. In 1749, the town was re-chartered by the Mason proprietors as &quot;Monadnock No. 2&quot;, sometimes called &quot;Middle Monadnock&quot; or &quot;Middletown&quot;. It was one of the first towns established following the Masonian proprietors&#x27; purchase of undivided lands under the claim.

Settled about 1758, the town was regranted in 1767. It was incorporated in 1773 by Governor John Wentworth and named for George Jaffrey, member of a wealthy Portsmouth family. Jaffrey&#x27;s son was a life trustee of Dartmouth College and designer of the official college seal. The Contoocook River provided water power for mills. Village prosperity would be expressed in fine early architecture, including the Town Meetinghouse, built in 1775.

Beginning in the 1840s, the area&#x27;s scenic beauty attracted tourists, and several summer hotels were built at the base of Mount Monadnock, enduringly popular with hikers. Some who scaled the summit were Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau and Rudyard Kipling. The experience inspired Emerson in 1845 to write the poem, &quot;Monadnoc&quot;.

Jaffrey was the setting for a 1950 biography by Elizabeth Yates entitled &quot;Amos Fortune, Free Man&quot;, winner of the 1951 Newbery Medal. Amos Fortune was an African-born slave who purchased his freedom and that of his wife, and established a tannery in the village. He is buried in the local cemetery, as are bandbox craftswoman Hannah Davis and author and summer resident Willa Cather.

Jaffrey was the inspiration for a chapter in &quot;Parliament of Whores&quot; by P. J. O&#x27;Rourke, who was a resident for several years.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 4.42% of the town. Jaffrey village is in the eastern part of the town, and the smaller village of Jaffrey Center is near the town center.

Thorndike Pond is in the north, and Contoocook Lake is on the southern boundary. Mount Monadnock, elevation and the highest point in Jaffrey as well as Cheshire County, is in the northwest. Jaffrey lies mostly within the Merrimack River watershed, via the Contoocook River in the eastern part of the town, with the northwest corner of town lying in the Ashuelot River watershed, part of the larger Connecticut River watershed.

Many of the settlers were from Marlborough, Massachusetts, which had been named for John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, in the late 17th century. Land was set off in 1815 to create the town of Troy.

There was once an important granite industry here. Stone from Marlborough quarries was used in buildings in Boston, at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, and locally in the Frost Free Library. Blankets and wooden-ware, including toys, have been manufactured in Marlborough as well.

<text>Winchester is a town in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 4,150 at the 2020 census. The primary community in the town, where 1,606 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as the Winchester census-designated place (CDP). The town also includes the village of Ashuelot and part of Pisgah State Park.

==History==
Originally named &quot;Arlington&quot; in honor of Charles Fitzroy, Earl of Arlington, this town was one of those established in 1733 by colonial Governor Jonathan Belcher as protection for the Massachusetts Bay Colony border at the Connecticut River. This was in the area encompassed in the relatively newly acquired Equivalent Lands. After being designated a part of the Province of New Hampshire in 1741, the town was granted to Colonel Josiah Willard, commander of the Fort Dummer outpost. In 1753, it was incorporated by Governor Benning Wentworth as &quot;Winchester&quot;, for Charles Paulet, 3rd Duke of Bolton, 8th Marquess of Winchester, and constable of the Tower of London.

Pioneers who came to the town as early as 1732 were attacked many times by Indigenous peoples. Several settlers were taken captive, and the town was burned in 1745. Its church, founded in 1736, is the oldest religious body in Cheshire County. The town has two covered bridges.

The Winchester Profession, an influential statement of the principles of Universalism, was adopted at a Universalist congress in Winchester in 1803.

Although it has been an agricultural town, many small industries have been established in Winchester. In the 1830s, Graves &amp; Company was among the nation&#x27;s first manufacturers of musical instruments. The coming of the Ashuelot Railroad in 1850 fostered the growth of textile mills and wooden-ware factories, especially box manufacture and leather tanning.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 1.01% of the town. Winchester is drained by the Ashuelot River and its tributary Mirey Brook. Pisgah Reservoir and Kilburn Pond are in the northwest. The entire town is part of the Connecticut River watershed. The highest point in Winchester is Franklin Mountain, near the town&#x27;s northeastern corner.

Winchester is served by state routes 10, 78 and 119.

<text>Bean&#x27;s Purchase is a township in Coös County, New Hampshire, United States. The purchase lies entirely within the White Mountain National Forest. The population was zero as of the 2020 census.

In New Hampshire, locations, grants, townships (which are different from towns), and purchases are unincorporated portions of a county which are not part of any town and have limited self-government (if any, as many are uninhabited).

==History==
In 1851 the New Hampshire state legislature authorized the governor and council to appoint a land commissioner to sell the public lands, and James Willey of Conway was appointed to that office. Bean&#x27;s Purchase was made by Commissioner Willey to Alpheus Bean of Bartlett in 1812 for $1,025 and contained about .

In 1927, Beth McKenzie (née Richardson) was born in Bean&#x27;s Purchase, making her the first white child born in the White Mountain National Forest, which was established in 1918. Betty Brook in the nearby town of Berlin is named in her honor.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the purchase has a total area of , of which , or 0.16%, are water. The center of the purchase is within the valley of the Wild River, with a large portion of it within the Wild River Wilderness. The western side of the purchase is dominated by the ridgeline of Wildcat Mountain, the Carter mountains, and Mount Moriah. The highest point in Bean&#x27;s Purchase is the summit of Carter Dome, at above sea level. The Appalachian Trail crosses the purchase, following the crest of the Wildcat-Carter-Moriah ridge. The west side of the ridgeline drains to the Peabody River. The Peabody and Wild rivers are both northeast-flowing tributaries of the Androscoggin River. The summits of North Baldface, Mount Meader, and West Royce form a line along the eastern edge of Bean&#x27;s Purchase, and the eastern slopes of those mountains are part of the Saco River watershed.

<text>Lancaster is a town located along the Connecticut River in Coös County, New Hampshire, United States. The town is named after the city of Lancaster in England. As of the 2020 census, the town population was 3,218, the second largest in the county after Berlin. It is the county seat of Coös County and gateway to the Great North Woods Region of the state. Lancaster, which includes the villages of Grange and South Lancaster, is home to Weeks State Park and the Lancaster Fair. Part of the White Mountain National Forest is in the eastern portion. The town is part of the Berlin, NH−VT Micropolitan Statistical Area.

The main village in town, where 1,941 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined as the Lancaster census-designated place (CDP) and is located at the junctions of U.S. Route 3 and U.S. Route 2, along the Israel River.

Lancaster is the site of the Porcupine Freedom Festival, an annual liberty-themed festival of the Free State Project that draws thousands of visitors each year.

== History ==

Granted as &quot;Upper Coos&quot; in 1763 by colonial Governor Benning Wentworth to Captain David Page of Petersham, Massachusetts, the town was settled in 1764 by his son, David Page, Jr. and Emmons Stockwell. It was the first settlement north of Haverhill, New Hampshire, to the south, and originally included land in what is now Vermont. Situated on the northern Connecticut River, the community endured many Indian hostilities. It would be named for Lancaster, Massachusetts, hometown of an early inhabitant. Reverend Joshua Weeks, a grantee of the town, was among the group of explorers who named the mountains of the Presidential Range. Other grantees were Timothy Nash and Benjamin Sawyer, who discovered Crawford Notch in 1771, making a shorter route to Portland, Maine, possible.

Many water-powered mills have come and gone, including sawmills, several potato starch mills, one of the largest gristmills in the state, and carriage factories. A granite quarry operated in the Kilkenny Range. With fertile meadows beside the Connecticut River, Lancaster was in 1874 the twelfth most productive agricultural town in the state. An extension of the Boston, Concord &amp; Montreal Railroad shipped products to market, and brought tourists to the grand hotels in the area.

Just south of the village center is Mount Prospect, summer home to Senator John W. Weeks, who sponsored congressional legislation creating White Mountain National Forest. In 1910, he purchased several farms to assemble the estate. It is now Weeks State Park, which features a fire lookout and his mansion, open for tours during the summer. The Mount Prospect Ski Tow operates on the slope in winter, snow conditions permitting. Many of the White Mountains and Green Mountains can be seen from the stone observation tower built in 1912 atop the summit. The Presidential Range is to the southeast, with the Franconia Range to the south. Mount Weeks, elevation , is in the Kilkenny Range to the northeast. It is named for the senator, as is the Weeks Medical Center. Weeks Memorial Library, a Beaux Arts landmark listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000, was given by John W. Weeks in memory of his father, William Dennis Weeks.

<text>Whitefield is a town in Coös County, New Hampshire, United States, in the White Mountains Region. The population was 2,490 at the 2020 census. Situated on the northern edge of the White Mountains, Whitefield is home to the Mount Washington Regional Airport and the White Mountains Regional High School.

Whitefield is part of the Berlin, NH-VT Micropolitan Statistical Area. The central village in the town, where 1,460 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined as the Whitefield census-designated place (CDP) and is located at the junction of U.S. Route 3, New Hampshire Route 116 and NH Route 142.

== History ==

The last town to be granted under the English provincial government, Whitefield was chartered on July 4, 1774, exactly two years before adoption of the Declaration of Independence. Some believe it was named for George Whitefield, a famous English evangelist and a friend of William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth, the patron of Dartmouth College. Others believe the name originated from earlier references to the snowy white fields one would see upon approach through any of the surrounding mountain passages. The chartered name was &quot;Whitefields&quot;, but the &quot;s&quot; was dropped on December 1, 1804, the date of incorporation. Early grantees included Jeremy Belknap, historian, and John Langdon, who succeeded John Wentworth as governor.

With the entrance of the railroad in the 19th century, tourists discovered the town and its cool, clean mountain air. They sought relief from the heat, humidity and pollution of coal-era summers in Boston, Hartford, New York and Philadelphia. Several inns and hotels were built to accommodate their increasing numbers. On a hilltop facing the Presidential Range is the grandest, the Mountain View House (now called the Mountain View Grand Resort &amp; Spa), established in 1866. The historic hotel underwent an extensive renovation in the 2000s, and is now one of the most luxurious in New Hampshire.

The two railroad lines whose tracks crossed in the center of Whitefield were the Boston and Maine Railroad, running from Wells River, Vermont, to Berlin, New Hampshire; and the Maine Central Railroad, running from Portland, Maine, to St. Johnsbury, Vermont. Though the actual &quot;diamond&quot; track crossing with rails remains intact as of 2022, &quot;guarded&quot; by the last remaining, historic &quot;ball&quot;-type signal in all of New England, the tracks are mostly disused or torn-up on the old B&amp;M line in both directions from Whitefield, and from St. Johnsbury to Fabyan station, on the Maine Central line east of Whitefield. (The Conway Scenic Railroad now operates the old Maine Central &quot;Mountain Division&quot; between Fabyan station and North Conway, New Hampshire.)

Whitefield has many examples of Victorian architecture, including a landmark bandstand built in 1875 on the common. The century-old town hall with bell tower was torn down in 2013. At the 2014 town meeting, voters chose to build a pre-fab building to be located outside of the town center.

== Geography ==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.37%, are water. Whitefield is drained by the Johns River, which runs through the center of town, and its tributary Bog Brook. Forest Lake, the largest lake in town, straddles the Whitefield/Dalton town line and is located southwest of the town center. Burns Lake is near Forest Lake, off Route 116 closer to the town center. Mirror Lake is a small water body close to Route 3 north of the center of town.

The two highest points in Whitefield are Howland Hill and Kimball Hill, both of which top above sea level.

<text>Francis Israel Regardie (; né Regudy; November 17, 1907 – March 10, 1985) was an English and American occultist, ceremonial magician, and writer who spent much of his life in the United States. He wrote fifteen books on the subject of occultism.

Born to a working-class Orthodox Jewish family in the East End of London, Regardie and his family soon moved to Washington, D.C., in the United States. Regardie rejected Orthodox Judaism during his teenage years and took an interest in Theosophy, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jewish mysticism. It was through his interest in yoga that he encountered the writings of the occultist Aleister Crowley. Contacting Crowley, he was invited to serve as the occultist&#x27;s secretary, necessitating a move to Paris, France in 1928. He followed Crowley to England before their association ended. Living in England, he wrote two books on the Qabalah, &quot;A Garden of Pomegranates&quot; and &quot;The Tree of Life&quot;. In 1934 he then joined the Stella Matutina—a ceremonial magic order descended from the defunct Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn—but grew dissatisfied with its leadership and left. He also studied psychology, being particularly influenced by ideas from Jungian psychology, and explored Christian mysticism.

In 1937 he returned to the United States. Concerned that the Golden Dawn system of ceremonial magic would be lost, he published the Stella Matutina rituals in a series of books between 1938 and 1940. This entailed breaking his oath of secrecy and brought anger from many other occultists. During the Second World War he served in the U.S. Army. On returning to the U.S., he gained a doctorate in psychology before relocating to Los Angeles in 1947 and setting up practice as a chiropractor. In 1981 he retired and moved to Sedona, Arizona, where he died of a heart attack four years later.

==Biography==
===Early life: 1907–1931===

Regardie was born Israel Regudy on 17 November 1907 off of the Mile End Road in London&#x27;s East End, then a poor area. His parents, Barnet Regudy, a cigarette maker, and Phoebe Perry, were poor Orthodox Jewish immigrants from Zhitomir, Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine). His family changed their surname to &quot;Regardie&quot; after a clerical mixup resulted in Israel&#x27;s elder brother being enrolled in the British Army under that name. Regardie emigrated with his parents to the United States in August 1921 and settled in Washington, D.C. Regardie&#x27;s parents believed that the Talmudic stories were literally true. With a Hebrew tutor he gained a linguistic knowledge which would prove invaluable in his later studies of Hermetic Qabalah. In his teenage years, Regardie rejected this parental faith, coming to describe Judaism as &quot;a load of rubbish&quot;. He began reading the work of Helena Blavatsky, the founder of Theosophy. From there, he read Hindu texts like the &quot;Upanishads&quot; and the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; as well as Buddhist texts like the &quot;Dhammapada&quot; and the &quot;Milinda Panha&quot;.

Interested in becoming a painter, he studied at an art school in Philadelphia. He also joined the Societas Rosicruciana in America at around this time. While in Washington, D.C., he came across a discussion of yoga in &quot;Book 4&quot;, a work by the occultist Aleister Crowley. Impressed by it, he wrote to Crowley via the latter&#x27;s publisher, receiving a response eight months later. Crowley advised Regardie to meet with Karl Germer, his agent in the United States. Regardie visited Germer in New York City, where he purchased the ten volume of Crowley&#x27;s periodical, &quot;The Equinox&quot;. In March 1926 he was initiated into the 0=0 degree of the Washington College of the Societas Rosicruciana in America, subsequently being initiated into the Zelator grade in June 1927.

Through Crowley&#x27;s work, Regardie moved from the practice of yoga to that of ceremonial magic. When Crowley asked Regardie to travel to Paris to serve as his personal secretary, the young man agreed; he told his parents that he would be studying with an English painter in Paris. In October 1928, Regardie sailed from New York City to Paris. Regardie hoped that Crowley would personally instruct him in occult practices, but this did not occur; Crowley expected his pupils to learn things for themselves and only seek his advice when in difficulty. Crowley urged Regardie to overcome his inhibitions, including by visiting prostitutes to lose his virginity; from one of these encounters he reportedly contracted gonorrhoea. Regardie spent much time studying Crowley&#x27;s material, both published and unpublished. As a magical name, he took &quot;Frater NChSh&quot; (&quot;The Serpent&quot;), although also became known as &quot;Father Scorpio&quot;. Through his involvement with Crowley, Regardie came to know Gerald Yorke, although the duo never became friends. Crowley would sometimes play two simultaneous games of chess, one with Regardie and the other with Yorke.

In January 1929, Regardie was hospitalised for a period. Then, in March, Regardie&#x27;s sister—who had become aware of the content of Crowley&#x27;s writings—contacted the French authorities to urge them to investigate what had happened to her brother. The Sûreté Générale did so, discovering that Regardie did not have an identity card permitting him residence in France. He received an expulsion notice giving him 24 hours to leave the country; Crowley was soon also ordered to leave. Regardie moved to Brussels in Belgium, where he began a relationship with Crowley&#x27;s then-lover, Maria Theresa Ferrari de Miramar. Crowley had returned to England, and in late 1929 Regardie joined him there, living in Knockholt, Kent. Crowley could no longer afford to keep Regardie as his secretary and the pair parted amicably.
Regardie then became secretary to the author Thomas Burke, who encouraged his own literary intentions.

===Early literary career: 1932–1937===

While visiting North Devon, Regardie began writing a book on Qabalah, for which he drew upon the writings of occultists like Crowley, Éliphas Lévi, and A. E. Waite. The result, &quot;A Garden of Pomegranates&quot;, was published by Rider and Company in 1932. He dedicated the book to Crowley. He followed this with a more substantial volume on Qabalah, &quot;The Tree of Life: A Study in Magic&quot;.
Among those to read the work was the occultist Dion Fortune, who considered it to be &quot;quite the best book on magic&quot; that she had read. She and Regardie met, but while the latter admired her writings he was unimpressed with her in person. Regardie later publicly criticised her for misrepresenting his works in her reviews of them; she had claimed that his works bolstered her beliefs about the Masters, although Regardie insisted that he was sceptical about the existence of such entities.

The publication of works on Qabalah aimed at a general audience angered some occultists who thought Regardie was sharing information too widely. As a result of the controversy, in 1934 he made contact with members of the Stella Matutina, a ceremonial magic occultist order that had branched off the since-dissolved Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. With Crowley&#x27;s blessing, he was initiated into the group, taking on the magical name &quot;Ad Majorem Adonai Gloriam&quot;. He rapidly progressed through the grades of the order, reaching that of Zelator Adeptus Minor, but grew disillusioned with the group&#x27;s leaders, regarding them as being egotistical and preoccupied with collecting grandiose titles. He resolved to publish the group&#x27;s ritual material, believing that it would ensure that the Golden Dawn ritual system was not lost and would benefit a far wider range of people; this would entail breaking the oath of secrecy he took upon entering the order. In February 1935, Regardie finished writing &quot;My Rosicrucian Adventure&quot;, which was published as &quot;What You Should Know about the Golden Dawn&quot;.

His literary endeavours brought Regardie little money and while in England he lived largely in poverty. Regardie had a growing passion for psychology and studied psychoanalysis through a Jungian framework under E. Clegg and J. L. Bendit. Although influenced by Jungian psychology, he disagreed with some of the ideas of its founder, Carl Jung, such as the idea that all humans could be classified as either introverts or extroverts, something that Regardie deemed too simplistic. He also began exploring Christian mysticism. He was particularly attracted to the figure of Francis of Assisi; he began using the name &quot;Francis&quot; himself after he was given it by a woman he was in a relationship with.

===Back in the United States: 1937–1950===

In 1937 he decided to return to the United States after nine years abroad. Shortly after doing so, Regardie and Crowley fell out. Regardie sent Crowley a copy of his latest publication; the latter&#x27;s response made fun of Regardie&#x27;s use of the name &quot;Francis&quot;, calling him &quot;Frank&quot;, and including an anti-semitic slur. Regardie wrote an angry letter back, calling Crowley &quot;Alice&quot; and describing him as &quot;a contemptible bitch&quot;. Crowley then circulated a document attacking Regardie, accusing him of exploiting his benefactors and of contracting gonorrhoea. This incident led Regardie to distance himself from occultism for several years.

In 1938 his book, &quot;The Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, was published; it examined alchemy through the lens of psychology, seeking psychological interpretations for alchemical symbolism. Regardie later came to reject this understanding of alchemy, referring to it as &quot;by far my worst book&quot; and regretting having written it.
From 1938 to 1940, Aries Press of Chicago published four volumes of Golden Dawn material edited by Regardie. It sold slowly. The historian Richard Kaczynski noted that &quot;it quickly became a classic&quot;. For this act he was vilified by many in the occultist community, some of whom cursed him. Crowley claimed that the publication of this material was &quot;pure theft&quot;, although he had personally published Golden Dawn ritual material himself. The published material influenced many readers, resulting in the formation of many groups that used the Golden Dawn rituals as a basis.

In the U.S., he focused his attentions on psychotherapy and especially the work of Wilhelm Reich. He studied at the Chiropractic College of New York City, graduating in 1941. After the United States joined the Second World War, Regardie joined the US Army, serving with them between 1942 and 1945. After the war he returned to the U.S. and obtained a doctorate in psychology. His interest in Reichian ideas influenced the exercises put forward in his book &quot;Be Yourself - The Art of Relaxation&quot;. He followed this work with &quot;The Middle Pillar&quot; and &quot;The Art of True Healing&quot;, in which he showcased his psychological approach to Qabalistic magical practices.

Maintaining his interest in Christian mysticism, Regardie began exploring Christian Science and New Thought, both movements that stressed the ability to heal sickness with thought. In 1946 his book on the subject, &quot;The Romance of Metaphysics&quot;, was published; it would be republished as &quot;The Teachers of Fulfilment&quot;.
In 1947, Regardie moved to Los Angeles, where he set up practice as a chiropractor. For some of his clients, he also engaged in psychotherapy and used Reichian tactics to heal their ailments. This career proved a financial success, eventually earning 80,000 dollars a year.
He also taught psychiatry at the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic. He contributed articles to the &quot;Psychiatric Quarterly&quot; and &quot;The American Journal of Psychotherapy&quot;.

===Developing career: 1951–1979===

Throughout the 1950s, Regardie continued to avoid much contact with the occultist movement. He consistently avoided the public eye, refusing interviews to appear on radio and television; he was concerned that publicity would bring with it persecution.
Like Crowley, Regardie was interested in mind-altering substances, and in the 1950s he experimented with using LSD under laboratory conditions.

Regardie began editing various of Crowley&#x27;s writings for republication, among them &quot;Book Four&quot;, &quot;Three Holy Books&quot;, &quot;AHA!&quot;, &quot;The Vision and the Voice&quot;, &quot;The World&#x27;s Tragedy&quot;, &quot;Magick without Tears&quot;, and an edited collection called &quot;The Best of Crowley&quot;.
In the 1970s, &quot;The Golden Dawn&quot; volumes were republished, selling more briskly than they had on first publication.

Although he had ended his association with Crowley on bad terms, he was angered on reading the first biography of Crowley, &quot;The Great Beast&quot; by John Symonds, which he thought was unduly negative and failed to understand Crowley&#x27;s beliefs. Regardie decided to write his own book about Crowley, but it took over a decade to produce.
In 1970, Regardie&#x27;s &quot;The Eye in the Triangle: An Interpretation of Aleister Crowley&quot;, was published. The work starts as a memoir of Regardie&#x27;s time with Crowley before moving on to a biographical account of the occultist&#x27;s life up till 1914. By that point, Regardie believed, Crowley had achieved everything of significance in his life.
In the work, Regardie sought to balance his appreciation for Crowley with a discussion of what he saw as the man&#x27;s faults.
In &quot;The Eye in the Triangle&quot;, Regardie argued that Aiwass—the entity whom Crowley claimed had given him &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; in 1904—was actually a facet of Crowley&#x27;s own psyche.

He also wrote other works. One was &quot;Twelve Steps to Spiritual Enlightenment&quot;, a textbook on how to practice magic that was later republished as &quot;The One Year Manual&quot;. Subsequent books, published by the UK-based Aquarian Press, included &quot;A Practical Guide to Geomantic Divination&quot; and &quot;How to Make and Use Talismans&quot;.

Regardie&#x27;s works gained a growing readership in the Counterculture of the 1960s.
He received correspondence from many of his readers, much of which he thought was unhinged; he collected these in a manuscript he called &quot;Liber NVTS&quot;. His house was burgled twice, with the burglars seeking to steal Golden Dawn and Crowleyan material. He befriended various occultists, including Christopher Hyatt. He also established friendly contact with the author Robert Anton Wilson, who provided an introduction for the third edition of &quot;The Eye in the Triangle&quot;. He corresponded again with Yorke, who was now a Tibetan Buddhist. He also became friends with the Thelemite Grady McMurtry, who asked for his and Yorke&#x27;s approval before relaunching Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) from his Berkeley home. Regardie never joined O.T.O., but wished it well. He was also an acquaintance of the psychedelics proponent Timothy Leary.

===Later life: 1980–1985===

In 1980, Regardie&#x27;s &quot;Ceremonial Magic: A Guide to the Mechanisms of Ritual&quot; was published in both the UK and US. In this book, he encouraged prospective ceremonial magicians to engage in self-initiation. By the 1980s, Regardie had developed a deep dislike of Christianity. He came to believe that Jesus of Nazareth had never existed, and that the myth around him was derived from that of the ancient Egyptian god Osiris.

In 1981, Regardie began instructing a woman in the Golden Dawn system. She went on to establish a temple in Los Angeles, for which Regardie agreed to act as a consultant if they ran into difficulty. Among the group&#x27;s members was Gerald Suster, later a writer on occultism. The group was damaged by personality differences and ended up in schism.
In 1981, Regardie retired from his chiropractic clinic and left Los Angeles for Sedona, Arizona.
In 1984, Regardie&#x27;s &quot;The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic&quot;, a book over a thousand pages long, was published.

In 1983 he visited Fiji, Australia, and New Zealand; in February 1984 he visited Hawaii and considered moving there.
Regardie died from a heart attack in the presence of close friends during a dinner at a Sedona restaurant on March 10, 1985, at the age of 77. He left his money to his nephew, a lawyer in New York City. Other material was left to Christopher Hyatt, who established the Israel Regardie Foundation.

==Personal life==

Over the course of his life, Regardie married and divorced three times; he had no children.

Regardie suffered from asthma, sometimes known as &quot;the occultist&#x27;s disease&quot; within the occult community. Suster noted that, in old age at least, Regardie had &quot;a most delightful sense of humour&quot;.
He was a fan of boxing; it was one of the few things he would watch on television.
He enjoyed cannabis and, in later life, used LSD around once a year.

==Legacy==
Regardie is a principal reliable source for much of what is known about the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. His writings and the students he taught or influenced provide much of the foundation for modern Western occultism. In addition to preserving the knowledge, Regardie also preserved a valid branch of the initiatory lineage of the Golden Dawn in America:
The second significant task carried out by Regardie was, as an Adept, to bring a valid branch of the initiatory lineage of the Golden Dawn to America the alchemical melting pot where the New Age was incubating. Such tasks are not always easy. A. M. A. G. waited here four decades until the threads of the pattern came together. Then, in one of those graceful synchronicities which often play midwife to significant magical events, a couple in Georgia were inspired—at that time scarcely aware of what they were undertaking — to build a Rosicrucian Vault, the powerful ritual chamber required to pass on the Adept Initiation, at precisely the time when two magicians (one on the east coast of the United States and one on the west coast), unknown to each other or to the Georgia couple, came to be ready to receive that Initiation. And A.M.A.G., with the right to confer the Initiation in such a Vault, was the connecting link among them. And so, in one remarkable weekend, Regardie presided over two Initiations into the Inner Order, the first and the last which he ever performed; and the Lamp of the Keryx was passed into American hands. — Forrest, Adam P. in Cicero (1995), p. 541

Note: in the above paragraph, A.M.A.G. refers to Regardie. Participants in the Order took on a pseudonym or &quot;magical motto&quot;. In Regardie&#x27;s case, his motto was &quot;Ad Majorem Adonai Gloriam&quot; which means &quot;To the Greater Glory of Adonai&quot;.

In his biography of Regardie, Gerald Suster described him as &quot;one of the most important figures in the twentieth-century development of what some have called the Western Esoteric Tradition&quot;.

<text>Bristol is a town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 3,244 at the 2020 census. It is home to Wellington State Park, Sugar Hill State Forest, and Profile Falls on the Smith River. Surrounded by hills and lakes, Bristol includes the lower two-thirds of Newfound Lake, a resort area.

The primary settlement in town, where 1,911 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as the Bristol census-designated place (CDP) and is located at the intersection of New Hampshire routes 3A and 104.

==History==

Bristol was taken from Bridgewater and New Chester (now Hill) and incorporated June 24, 1819. Colonel Peter Sleeper, Benjamin Emmons, and others commenced a settlement here in 1770.

Extensive deposits of fine sand or clay similar to the &quot;Bristol Sand&quot; used in Bristol, England, to make fine china and pottery gave the town its name. Here the sand was used to make a superior quality brick, marketed as Bristol brick. With water power from the Newfound River, the town was a center of manufacturing in the early days for goods such as paper, leather, woolens, flannel, bedsteads and piano stools.

On January 16, 1884, the town of Bristol voted to accept the gift of a library building and land from Josiah Minot and Solomon Sleeper and to manage and maintain a public library. The Minot–Sleeper Library became the first building erected to specifically house a public library in the Lakes Region at the time, when it was officially opened to the community in 1885. On August 15, 2012, a groundbreaking ceremony was held in celebration of the library&#x27;s expansion. In February 2013, the new addition was ready for use.

Bristol is one of four towns with shoreline on Newfound Lake, which has been a tourist destination since the mid-19th century. Farmers at first rented rooms and provided meals, but in the 1870s, hotels including the Hotel Bristol and G. G. Brown Hotel were built. In 1874, Bristol was the terminus of the Franklin and Bristol Branch railroad. The New Hampshire Central Railroad was planned to pass through Bristol. In the 1920s, W. F. Darling created a compound of about one hundred cottages for rent, first known as Hiland Park and later as Bungalo Village. In 2004, the compound was sold to a proprietor who sold individual cottages to permanent owners.
In 2022, Bristol inaugurated a new solar array. Local media highlighted the array in the context of town&#x27;s energy independence, which dated from the 1800s when hydropower provided all the town&#x27;s energy.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 23.60% of the town. Bristol is drained by the Pemigewasset River (forming the southeastern boundary of the town), the Smith River (on the town&#x27;s short southern boundary) and the Newfound River, draining Newfound Lake and most of the center of town. The highest point in town is Bristol Peak, elevation above sea level. Bristol lies fully within the Merrimack River watershed.

<text>Enfield is a town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 4,465 at the 2020 census. The town includes the villages of Enfield, Enfield Center, Upper Shaker Village, Lower Shaker Village, Lockehaven, and Montcalm.

Enfield village, the primary settlement in town, where 1,571 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined as the Enfield census-designated place (CDP), centered on U.S. Route 4 and the inlet of the Mascoma River into Mascoma Lake.

== History ==

The town was incorporated in 1761 by colonial Governor Benning Wentworth. First named &quot;Enfield&quot; by settlers from Enfield, Connecticut, the town was renamed &quot;Relhan&quot; in 1766 to honor Dr. Anthony Relhan (–1776). The doctor was a promoter of sea-bathing as a curative, making Brighton, England, a fashionable resort. Following the American Revolution, the New Hampshire town was renamed Enfield in 1784.

The first European settlers in town were Jonathan Paddleford and family who arrived, after the successful conclusion of the French and Indian War, between 1765 and 1772.

On the southwest shore of Mascoma Lake is Enfield Shaker Village, once a utopian religious community of Shakers, renowned for simple and functional architecture and furniture. Established in 1793 and called &quot;Chosen Vale&quot;, the village was subdivided into several &quot;Families&quot;, with men and women leading pious, celibate and industrious lives. Although the genders shared dormitories, like Enfield&#x27;s Great Stone Dwelling built between 1837 and 1841, the sexes used separate doors and stairways. They practiced ecstatic singing and dancing, an expression of their worship, which earned them the appellation of Shaking Quakers, or Shakers.

Several trades operated at the village, from agriculture and packaging of seeds, to the manufacture of brooms, brushes, spinning-wheels, and furniture. To speed delivery of products to the railroad across Mascoma Lake, in 1849 the community erected Shaker Bridge.

The Shaker movement crested in the 1840s, with 19 &quot;societies&quot; scattered from Maine to Kentucky and west to Indiana. But growing employment opportunities created by the Industrial Revolution, as near as the mill town of Lebanon, enticed away potential and practicing church members. Others grew disaffected with celibacy, self-abnegation, and communal ownership of property. Indeed, Mary Marshall Dyer, once a member of the Enfield church, became an outspoken Anti-Shaker. Eventually the village would close and, in 1927, be sold to the La Salette Brotherhood of Montreal, a Catholic order noted for its Christmas display. In 1986, Enfield Shaker Village was established as a museum on part of the historic property. The museum steadily expanded its footprint by purchases of key Shaker properties, culminating in the acquisition of all the remaining La Salette buildings and land in September 2023 when the Catholic order left Enfield.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 6.60% of the town. Enfield is drained by the Mascoma River, a west-flowing tributary of the Connecticut River. Mascoma Lake, in the west, represents Enfield&#x27;s lowest elevation at above sea level. The highest elevation is over at the summit of Prospect Hill, overlooking Halfmile Pond. Crystal Lake is in the east. The town lies fully within the Connecticut River watershed.

<text>Lisbon is a town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,621 at the 2020 census. Lisbon hosts an annual lilac festival on Memorial Day weekend.

The main village, where 965 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined as the Lisbon census-designated place (CDP) and is located along U.S. Route 302 and the Ammonoosuc River in the southwestern corner of the town.

== History ==
Lisbon was first granted in 1763 by colonial Governor Benning Wentworth as &quot;Concord&quot;. In 1764 the town was renamed &quot;Chiswick&quot;, after the Duke of Devonshire&#x27;s castle, while Rumford in central New Hampshire took the name &quot;Concord&quot; in 1765. In 1768, the town was settled and renamed again, this time to &quot;Gunthwaite&quot;, after a relation of colonial Governor John Wentworth. The name &quot;Lisbon&quot; was selected by Governor Levi Woodbury when it was incorporated in 1824. His friend, Colonel William Jarvis, had been consul at Lisbon, Portugal. The town once included land that is now part of Littleton and Sugar Hill.

Charcoal-making was an early industry. Iron, gold and other minerals were mined here. The narrow, steep falls of the Ammonoosuc River provided water power for numerous watermills and factories, and the Parker Young Company was at one time the largest manufacturer of piano sounding boards in the world. Lisbon was the site of the first rope ski tow in New Hampshire.

The Lisbon Area Historical Society promotes the public&#x27;s interest in and appreciation for the towns of Lisbon, Landaff and Lyman, and maintains the collection, preservation and cataloging of materials which establish or illustrate the history of the three towns, their indigenous history and heritage, their exploration, settlement and development, as well as their cultural and artistic heritage.

<text>Plymouth is a New England town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States, in the White Mountains Region. It has a unique role as the economic, medical, commercial, and cultural center for the predominantly rural Plymouth, NH Labor Market Area. Plymouth is located at the confluence of the Pemigewasset and Baker rivers and sits at the foot of the White Mountains. The town&#x27;s population was 6,682 at the 2020 census. It is home to Plymouth State University, Speare Memorial Hospital, and Plymouth Regional High School.

The town&#x27;s main center, where 4,730 people resided at the 2020 census (three-quarters of whom are college student age), is defined as the Plymouth census-designated place (CDP), and is located along U.S. Route 3, south of the confluence of the Baker and Pemigewasset rivers.

Plymouth State University, in the center of town, has a total undergraduate population of 3,336 students and a total graduate population of 503 students as of the 2023/2024 academic year.

== History ==
Plymouth was originally the site of an Abenaki village that was burned to the ground by Captain Thomas Baker in 1712. This was just one of the many British raids on American Indian settlements during Queen Anne&#x27;s War. Part of a large plot of undivided land in the Pemigewasset Valley, the town was first named &quot;New Plymouth&quot;, after the original Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts. Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth granted Plymouth to settlers from Hollis, all of whom had been soldiers in the French and Indian War. Some had originally come from Plymouth, Massachusetts. The town was incorporated in 1763. Parts of Hebron and Campton were annexed in 1845 and 1860.

In 1806, then-lawyer Daniel Webster lost his first criminal case at the Plymouth courthouse, which now houses the Historical Society. The author Nathaniel Hawthorne, while on vacation in 1864 with former U.S. President Franklin Pierce, died in Plymouth at the second Pemigewasset House, which was later destroyed by fire in 1909. In the early 20th century, the Draper and Maynard Sporting Goods Company (D&amp;M) sold products directly to the Boston Red Sox, and players such as Babe Ruth would regularly visit to pick out their equipment. The Plymouth Normal School was founded in 1871 out of the already existing Holmes Plymouth Academy, becoming the state&#x27;s first teachers&#x27; college. It would later evolve into Plymouth Teachers&#x27; College in 1939, Plymouth State College in 1963, and finally Plymouth State University in 2003.

<text>Greenville is a town in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,974 at the 2020 census, down from 2,105 at the 2010 census. It is located at the junctions of New Hampshire routes 31, 45, and 123.

==History==
Once a part of Mason called &quot;Mason Village&quot;, Greenville is one of the state&#x27;s newest and smallest towns, incorporated in 1872. It is located at the High Falls on the Souhegan River, whose plentiful water power provided the mill town with the state&#x27;s first industries, making cotton and woolen goods. Because of the falls, Greenville was always a manufacturing center. The Columbian Manufacturing Company was established in 1826 to make textiles in both Greenville and neighboring New Ipswich. The Columbian is long gone, but its fine brick buildings still dominate the village, kept company by Queen Anne style houses on side streets. The mills are now used for other businesses and storage, and one has been converted into housing for the elderly.

Greenville once had a Boston &amp; Maine Railroad trestle. Before it was dismantled for safety reasons, local residents turned out one sunny afternoon to watch Bronson Potter, Mason resident and inventor, fly a private airplane underneath the span on a wager. The railroad depot, which still stands, was once an important landmark that put the tiny towns of Mason and Greenville &quot;on the map&quot;. It has since been turned into a Chinese restaurant and lounge.

==Geography==

<text>Henniker is a town in Merrimack County, New Hampshire, United States. As of the 2020 census, the reported total population of the town was 6,185, although the figure, 27.9% greater than the 2010 population, has been questioned by local officials.

==History==
The area was first known as &quot;Number Six&quot; in a line of settlements running between the Merrimack and Connecticut rivers. In 1752, the Masonian Proprietors granted the land to Andrew Todd, who called it &quot;Todd&#x27;s Town&quot;. Settled in 1761 by James Peter, it was dubbed &quot;New Marlborough&quot; by others from Marlboro, Massachusetts. Incorporated in 1768 by Governor John Wentworth, the town was named for Sir John Henniker, a London merchant of leather and fur, with shipping interests in Boston and Portsmouth.

In the 19th century Henniker had a high rate of congenital deafness, and its own sign language, which may have played a significant role in the emergence of American Sign Language.

Farmers found the town&#x27;s surface relatively even, with fertile soil. Various mills operated by water power on the Contoocook River, including a woolen factory. By 1859, the population was 1,688. But the mills in Henniker were closed in 1959 by the Hopkinton-Everett Lakes Flood Control Project.

The Edna Dean Proctor Bridge, a stone double-arch bridge spanning the Contoocook, was built in 1835. A building for Henniker Academy was constructed of split granite in 1836.

Beginning in the late 1800s, the river&#x27;s scenic beauty attracted tourism.

The game of paintball originated in Henniker in 1981.

== History ==
Hooksett was incorporated in 1822. First known as &quot;Chester Woods&quot; and &quot;Rowe&#x27;s Corner&quot;, the community was called &quot;Hooksett&quot; for nearly fifty years before being incorporated. The name may have come from a hook-shaped island in the Merrimack or from early fishermen, who called the area &quot;Hookline Falls&quot;. Rocky ledges flank the Merrimack River, and there were several cross-river ferries located here, as well as lumber mills and a brick-making establishment powered by the falls. The first census, taken in 1830, reported 880 residents.

The first settlement in the area was Martins Ferry near the Merrimack River and what is today&#x27;s Southern New Hampshire University. The name comes from the Martin family who owned the ferry and the land around the area for decades. Today, Martin&#x27;s Corner to the east bears the name. In 1794, the lottery-funded Hooksett Canal became part of the transportation facilities of the Amoskeag cotton mills in Manchester.

<text>Epping is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 7,125 at the 2020 census, up from 6,411 at the 2010 census.

The main village, where 2,693 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as the Epping census-designated place (CDP), along New Hampshire Route 27 just west of New Hampshire Route 125.

==History==

Epping was originally part of Exeter, one of the four original New Hampshire townships. Starting in 1710, Exeter awarded free wood lots in the area to encourage settlement. In 1741, Epping was granted a charter and incorporated as a town. It was the last New Hampshire town chartered by Governor Jonathan Belcher before the Province of New Hampshire was granted a governor who did not also govern the neighboring Province of Massachusetts Bay. Epping was named for Epping in England.

Through the 1800s, farming was a principal occupation in Epping. The town also had substantial reserves of clay, long used by local residents to make bricks, and in 1840, the first commercial brickyard was established in Epping.

The village once known as East Epping gave birth in 1863 to a Methodist camp called Camp Hedding. Hedding CMA (Camp Meeting Association) hosted Methodist revivals. Hedding became the name of a post office and railroad station in 1896, and the place name appears on road signs.

Epping was once an important junction of the Worcester, Nashua &amp; Rochester Railroad and the Portsmouth &amp; Concord Railroad, later both part of the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad. The north-south WN&amp;R line through town was abandoned in 1932, with a short segment remaining in place south to Fremont to serve a lumber yard and barrel manufacturer located there. This left the east-west Portsmouth Branch between Manchester and Portsmouth as Epping&#x27;s only access to the national rail network.

Passenger service on the Portsmouth Branch ceased in 1954, although mixed-train service continued until 1960. A regular freight running from Concord to Portsmouth and return served Epping until 1972, after which a local freight out of Concord served the branch as needed, usually once or twice a week and often not passing beyond Epping where the last concentration of customers was located. Customers in Epping at this time included the Merrimack Farmers Exchange and the W.S. Goodrich brickyard. Occasional hi-and-wide freight movements operated over the Portsmouth Branch in the 1970s due to the lack of close clearance points, with several carrying materials destined to the under-construction Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant. Declining track conditions led to the B&amp;M embargoing the branch in December 1979, with the last trains operating to Epping earlier that year and the final train to Raymond following in July 1980 despite the embargo. The Boston &amp; Maine abandoned the track from East Manchester to Newfields in 1982, and the rail was removed in Epping between 1983 and 1985. The railroad beds are now the Rockingham Recreational Trail. Abutments for the WN&amp;R bridge over the Lamprey River can be seen to the west of Route 125.

==Geography==
A chronic quip about &quot;Epping—the center of the universe&quot; remains visible on bumper stickers. However, due to its location at the crossroads of Route 101 and Route 125, the town has indeed become a retail center serving the neighboring towns. It has attracted chain stores since Route 101 was upgraded to an expressway in the mid-1990s, with strip malls and big-box stores arriving in the 2010s.

The town also has a traditional center clustered around Main Street and Route 27, an older road connecting Exeter with Hooksett and Manchester. These parts of town retain their traditional architecture.

The area on Route 27 near the Raymond border is known as West Epping.

The town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 0.70% of the town. Epping is drained by the Lamprey and Piscassic rivers. The highest point in Epping is Kennard Hill at above sea level, located in the town&#x27;s northwest corner. Epping lies fully within the Piscataqua River (Coastal) watershed.

The town center, defined as the Epping census-designated place (CDP), has a total area of , all land.

==Climate==

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Epping has a warm-summer humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps. The hottest temperature recorded in Epping was on August 2, 1975, while the coldest temperature recorded was on February 3, 1971.

==Culture==
There are two auto racing venues in Epping. New England Dragway, New England&#x27;s only quarter-mile track, runs races Wednesday and Friday nights and all day on the weekends, including the IHRA Amalie Oil North American Nationals and, since 2013, the NHRA New England Nationals. The dragway hosts a popular Halloween display during the second half of October. Star Speedway is a NASCAR stock-car oval operating on Saturdays.

An annual canoe race down the Lamprey River occurs on the last weekend in April. Camp Hedding hosts an annual camp meeting for one week in August and an &quot;olde time fair&quot; on the first Saturday of August every year.

Epping has two annual parades, the memorial parade and the Christmas parade. The memorial parade usually includes youth sports teams, scouts, the combined middle and high school marching band, the fire department, police department, and veterans. The Christmas parade includes a few fire trucks and police cars that go around town with a Santa Claus character and his elves throwing candy to any children who are outside.

<text>Hampton is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 16,214 at the 2020 census. On the Atlantic coast, Hampton is home to Hampton Beach, a summer tourist destination.

The densely populated central part of the town, where 9,597 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined as the Hampton census-designated place (CDP) and centers on the intersection of U.S. 1 and NH 27.

==History==
First called the &quot;Plantation of Winnacunnet&quot;, Hampton was one of four original New Hampshire townships chartered by the General Court of Massachusetts, which then held authority over the colony. &quot;Winnacunnet&quot; is an Algonquian Abenaki word meaning &quot;pleasant pines&quot; and is the name of the town&#x27;s high school, serving students from Hampton and the surrounding towns of Seabrook, North Hampton, and Hampton Falls.

In March 1635, Richard Dummer and John Spencer of the Byfield section of Newbury, Massachusetts, came round in their shallop, coming ashore at the landing, and were much impressed by the location. Dummer, who was a member of the General Court, got that body to lay its claim to the section and plan a plantation here. The Massachusetts General Court of March 3, 1636, ordered that Dummer and Spencer be given power to &quot;To presse men to build there a Bound house.&quot;
The town was settled in 1638 by a group of parishioners led by Oxford University graduate Reverend Stephen Bachiler, who had formerly preached at the settlement&#x27;s namesake: Hampton, England. The town, incorporated in 1639, once included Seabrook, Kensington, Danville, Kingston, East Kingston, Sandown, North Hampton and Hampton Falls. On September 18, 1679, the Acts of Privy Council records that Stephen Bachiler&#x27;s son-in-law, &quot;Christopher Hussey of Hampton, Esquire&quot;, was appointed by King Charles II to &quot;govern the provence of New Hampshire&quot; as a member of the newly established council of seven men.

Also among Hampton&#x27;s earliest settlers was Thomas Leavitt, who previously had been among the first settlers at Exeter. His descendant Thomas Leavitt, Esq., lived in Hampton Falls, and was the leading Democratic politician in southern New Hampshire for many years. He made a noted early survey and plan of the town of Hampton in 1806. James Leavitt, of the same family, occupied the home which had previously belonged to Gen. Jonathan Moulton. Later members of the family ran Leavitts&#x27; Hampton Beach Hotel, a fixture in the area for generations.

Construction of the railroad in the 1850s, as well as the Exeter and Hampton Trolley line, made Hampton&#x27;s oceanfront a popular resort. Hampton Beach remains a tourist destination, offering shops, restaurants, beaches, and summer seasonal housing.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 11.76% of the town.

Hampton is drained by the Hampton and Drakes rivers. The town lies fully within the New Hampshire Coastal watershed. The highest point in Hampton is Bride Hill (approximately above sea level), near the town line with Exeter.

<text>Londonderry is a town in western Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. It sits between Manchester and Derry, the largest and fourth-largest communities in the state. The population was 25,826 at the 2020 census. Londonderry is known for its apple orchards and is home to the headquarters of Stonyfield Farm and part of Manchester–Boston Regional Airport.

The more densely settled portion of town, where 11,645 people lived at the 2020 census, is defined as the Londonderry census-designated place (CDP) and roughly occupies the southeastern and southern parts of town, around New Hampshire Route 102.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

Londonderry lies in an area that was first known as &quot;Nutfield&quot; because of the dense woods with nut trees. A petition for the town was submitted to the General Court of the Province of New Hampshire on September 23, 1719. That petition stated that the petitioners had settled &quot;at Nutfield about the Eleventh of Aprile last&quot;—i.e. April 11, 1719. That petition requested &quot;ten miles square&quot; and stated that there were now about seventy families and inhabitants from both Ireland and New England. On June 21, 1722, the town was chartered and given the name &quot;Londonderry&quot;, after Londonderry in the province of Ulster in the north of Ireland. The grant made by Samuel Shute, Governor of the Province of New Hampshire, was for a tract of land described as follows:
&quot;Beginning on the North East Angle at a Beach Tree marked which is the south East angle of Chester and Running from thence due South on Kingstown Line four miles and an half and from thence on a West Line one mile and three Quarters and from thence South six miles and an half and from thence West north West nine miles and an half, and from thence North Eleven miles and an half from thence north north East Three miles from thence East South East one mile and from thence South South West to the South West Angle of Chester and from thence on an East Line Bounding on Chester Ten miles unto the Beach Tree first mentioned.”

The town was divided into two parishes on February 25, 1739/40. Windham was set off and incorporated on February 12, 1741/42. The northwest portion, with other land, was incorporated as Derryfield, now Manchester, on September 3, 1751. Derry was incorporated on July 2, 1827. Border adjustments and annexations were made throughout this period continuing until June 27, 1857, when the line with Hudson (formerly known as Nottingham West) was established.

In 1719, the first North American potato was grown in Derry, then a part of Londonderry.

Approval of the petition submitted to the Province of New Hampshire required the petitioners to obtain an agreement from Col. John Wheelwright for the sale of the land. He held claim to it based on a grant to his grandfather. That agreement was obtained on October 12, 1719, and included a statement of the bounds, extending west as far as the Merrimack River. This conflicted with a grant for the town of Dunstable, now Nashua, made by the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1673. The provincial line between Massachusetts and New Hampshire was not settled in its present location until 1741. Thus when Londonderry was granted, the westernmost portion actually lay within the Dunstable grant and the Province of Massachusetts Bay. The resulting land conflicts with &quot;Dunstable encroachers&quot; were still being dealt with by the town in 1783 and 1791. Private owners were resolving these conflicts between each other as late as 1812.

The first U.S. census, conducted in 1790, reported the town&#x27;s population to be 2,622.

=== 19th century to World War II ===
The Manchester and Lawrence Railroad was opened in November 1849, with depots at North Londonderry, Wilson&#x27;s Crossing, Derry and Windham. Two months later, on January 26, 1850, Dearborn Whittier, a prominent resident, was hit and killed by a railroad car at Wilson&#x27;s Crossing. On March 12 the town voted to require gates at all crossings, although the issue persisted for a few more years.

The Manchester and Derry Street Railroad, sometimes referred to as the Derry and Manchester Street Railroad or trolley car, opened in December 1907 and operated between Broadway in Derry and Elm Street in Manchester until August 1926.

=== Postwar history ===

Suburbanization after World War II, particularly the construction of Interstate 93, led to the town&#x27;s growth.

=== 21st century ===

The COVID-19 pandemic created divisions in Londonderry, including heated controversy around whether or not to adopt a mask mandate in the town&#x27;s schools.

==Geography==

Londonderry is the westernmost municipality in Rockingham County. It is bordered by the towns of Auburn to the northeast, Derry to the east, and Windham to the southeast, all in Rockingham County, and by Hudson to the south, Litchfield to the west, and Manchester to the north, in Hillsborough County. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 0.30% of the town.

The town of Londonderry is drained on the east and south by Beaver Brook and on the west by Little Cohas Brook, Watts Brook, Colby Brook and Nesenkeag Brook, all of which flow to the Merrimack River. The town&#x27;s highest point is above sea level, on Number Eight Hill (named after the old school house that used to be on it) north of the center of town.

The town is crossed by Interstate 93, New Hampshire Route 102, New Hampshire Route 128, and New Hampshire Route 28. Half of Manchester–Boston Regional Airport, including the main terminal, is in the northwest corner of the town.Though Londonderry has grown to become one of the larger towns, by population, in the state, it lacks any concentrated downtown area, central business district, or town center. Historically, no village had developed in Londonderry, as it was largely a rural farming area. Population growth in the town only began in the 1970s, when the construction of I-93 turned Londonderry into a bedroom community and exurb for the Greater Boston area. The major retail district lies in the town&#x27;s southeastern corner near where NH 102 interchanges with I-93, with smaller commercial districts lying at the intersection of NH 128 and NH 102, and near where NH 28 and NH 128 merge. The Londonderry census-designated place, covering the commercial districts listed above and neighboring residential areas, includes all land in the town south of NH 102 as well as land east of NH 128 as far north as Stonehenge Road. The Town Hall and schools are built near the geographic center of the town along an otherwise rural stretch of NH 128.

<text>Newmarket is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 9,430 at the 2020 census. Some residents are students and employees at the nearby University of New Hampshire in Durham.

The densely settled center of town, where 5,797 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined as the Newmarket census-designated place and is located at the junction of New Hampshire routes 108 and 152, along the Lamprey River.

== History ==

Incorporated in 1727, Newmarket is one of six towns granted by Massachusetts in the last year of the reign of King George I. It started as a parish of Exeter, and was granted full town privileges by the legislature in 1737. It was probably named for Newmarket in Suffolk, England. The Lamprey River, running through the town, was named for John Lamprey, an early settler. For a while, the town was called &quot;Lampreyville&quot;. Newmarket was a center of the New England shipping trade with the West Indies. The town&#x27;s main exports were timber, dried fish from the Squamscott River and salted alewives from the Lamprey River. The return cargo brought whale oil, molasses and rum back to Newmarket. Newmarket also had a robust shipbuilding presence. There were many ships built for the Royal Navy using trees from Newmarket and the surrounding towns. There is record of Newmarket building 21 ships in one year.

The Newmarket Manufacturing Company was incorporated in 1822, and constructed its first cotton textile mill during 1823 and 1824. The company dominated the mill town&#x27;s waterfront and economy, with seven textile mills harnessing water power at the falls. The company had cotton shipped up from the Deep South, so its production was adversely affected by the Civil War. It built numerous support structures, including multi-family housing for workers. The company built dams far upriver to create Pawtuckaway Pond in Nottingham and Mendums Pond in Barrington—during drought, the company could release a regulated flow of water from the dams into the Lamprey to run the works. The company closed in 1929.

Newmarket was affected by the 1922 New England Textile Strike, shutting down mills in the town over an attempted wage cut and hours increase.

Adapted for modern commercial and residential uses, the mill buildings are located within the Newmarket Industrial and Commercial Historic District, which in 1980 was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In the 1970s, the mill served as the headquarters of the Timberland Company, during the years when it grew from a small work-boot manufacturer to a leading &quot;urban&quot; fashion brand. Timberland&#x27;s headquarters are now in nearby Stratham.

The town&#x27;s parish of &quot;South Newmarket&quot; was incorporated as the separate town of Newfields in 1895.

==Geography==
Situated beside Great Bay in southeastern New Hampshire, Newmarket is drained by the Lamprey River and its tributary, the Piscassic River. The town&#x27;s highest point is the summit of Bald Hill, at above sea level, near the town&#x27;s southwestern corner. Great Hill, with an elevation of , rises just south of the town center.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 11.24% of the town.

The town is crossed by New Hampshire Route 108 and is the eastern terminus of New Hampshire Route 152.

<text>Raymond is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 10,684 at the 2020 census. Part of Pawtuckaway State Park is in the north.

The main village in town, where 3,738 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined as the Raymond census-designated place (CDP), and is located along the Lamprey River near New Hampshire Route 27.

== History ==
The town was first settled by families from Exeter as a parish of Chester, and known as &quot;Freetown&quot; because it was exempt from the usual obligation of reserving its tall pine trees for masts in the Royal Navy. The town was incorporated in 1764 by colonial governor Benning Wentworth.

There are at least two theories regarding the source of the town&#x27;s name. The earlier theory, stated by Joseph Fullonton in his &quot;History of Raymond&quot;, published 1875, is that the name was chosen as &quot;a new and classical one&quot;. Fullonton relates that the original name of Freetown &quot;arose from the ship timber business&quot; where the king claimed the best trees. The locals had other ideas and took the trees and &quot;being successful here, none molesting, they called it Freetown.&quot; Fullonton states that at incorporation in 1764, changing the name from &quot;Freetown&quot; to &quot;Raymond&quot; was &quot;taking a new and classical one, shows that there are minds not disposed to tread all the time in one path, but capable of thinking and advancing,&quot; and that the word &quot;Raymond&quot; means &quot;the lustrous, luminous or shining world.&quot;

In a second theory, the town was named for Captain William Rayment, or Raymond, of Beverly, Massachusetts, who had raised a company of soldiers to fight in the war against Canada in 1690. The Massachusetts General Court in 1735 granted Captain Raymond and his company a township called &quot;Beverly-Canada&quot; (now Weare) as payment for their services, but that claim was ruled invalid after New Hampshire separated from Massachusetts in 1741. So in 1767, heirs of the veterans were instead awarded land in Maine. Originally called &quot;Raymondtown Plantation&quot;, it today composes the Maine towns of Raymond, Casco and part of Naples.

In 1906, Andrew Carnegie awarded a grant of $2,000 toward the construction of a Carnegie library in Raymond, and in 1908 the Dudley-Tucker Library opened overlooking the Common.

The Concord and Portsmouth Railroad line from Concord to Portsmouth reached Raymond in 1861. In 1862 the alignment was altered, rerouting trains to Manchester rather than Concord. However, freight and passenger trains still originated in Concord and traveled south on the New Hampshire Division Main Line before entering the Portsmouth Branch at Manchester. The line later became the Portsmouth Branch of the Boston and Maine Railroad. Passenger service ended in 1954, with mixed train service continuing until 1960. Local freight service continued regularly until 1972 and as-needed afterwards, usually once or twice a week. A large gravel pit located near Onway Lake was a busy railroad customer until closing in 1971, as was the Regis Tannery downtown until a fire the same year. There were no regular rail customers in Raymond from 1971 until 1976, when Rehrig Pacific opened a plastics injection plant near Route 102. The last train served Raymond on July 31, 1980, and the tracks through town were abandoned in 1982 and removed between 1983 and 1985. The line is now a rail trail, and the restored depot survives today as home to the Raymond Historical Society.

New Hampshire Historical Marker #273 in Raymond recognizes Frank J. Mafera, a resident who patented the first method for weaving chain link fencing in 1930, and then founded the Barnyard Fence Company (later renamed the New Hampshire Fence Company) in Raymond.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 2.68% of the town. Raymond is drained by the Lamprey River and the Exeter River, both part of the Piscataqua River watershed. The highest point in town is Dumplingtown Hill, at above sea level, located near the town&#x27;s western border.

The town is crossed by state routes 27, 101, 102, 107, and 156.

<text>Durham is a town in Strafford County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 15,490 at the 2020 census, up from 14,638 at the 2010 census. Durham is home to the University of New Hampshire.

The primary settlement in the town, where 11,147 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as the Durham census-designated place (CDP) and includes the densely populated portion of the town centered on the intersection of New Hampshire Route 108 and Main Street, which includes the university that dominates the town.

== History ==
Durham sits beside Great Bay at the mouth of the Oyster River, an ideal location for people who lived close to the land, like the Western Abenaki and their ancestors who&#x27;ve lived in the region for an estimated 11,000 years. The Shankhassick (now Oyster) River provided shellfish and access to the north woods for hunting and trapping; the sea provided food and access to long-established trade routes between tribes both north and south; and the open meadows provided land easy to cultivate for crops. Wecannecohunt (or Wecohamet), as the settlement was known until English settlers arrived, proved immediately attractive to them, too.

English settlers first colonized the region in 1622 when King James I granted Sir Fernandino Gorges and John Mason &quot;all that part or porcon of that country now commonly called New-England ... between the latitude of forty and fortyeight degrees northerly latitude,&quot; including every island within 100 miles of the coast and &quot;all the lands, soyle, grounds, havens, ports, rivers, mines, ... minerals, pearls and pretious stones, woods, queries, marshes waters, fishings, hunting, hawking, fowling, commodities and hereditaments whatsoever.&quot; Gorges and Mason agreed to split the vast tract along the Piscataqua River (still known by its Abenaki name &quot;pesgatak was&quot;, for &quot;the water looks dark&quot;). Gorges took the tract to the east and named it Maine. Mason took the land to west and named it New Hampshire. The region was first named &quot;N&#x27;dakinna&quot;. It is the traditional ancestral homeland of the Abenaki, Pennacook and Wabanaki peoples.

Colonists first arrived in Wecannecohunt in 1622, the year of the Gorges-Mason grant. They spent their earliest years fishing, cutting, and trapping to sell salted fish, lumber, and fur to European markets. By 1633, colonists were spread along the tidal shores of the Oyster River, and by 1640, they were &quot;in &#x27;recognized possession&#x27; of lands up to the fall line.&quot; Colonial Durham was first known as the Oyster River Plantation. The English settlers brought non-native livestock aboard their ships, &quot;thousands of cattle, swine, sheep, and horses,&quot; requiring them to clear acres merely for pasture. Wecannecohunt&#x27;s fields, carefully cultivated across centuries, were trampled and their crops destroyed. &quot;The animals exacerbated a host of problems related to subsistence practices, land use, property rights and, ultimately, political authority.&quot; When violence between the colonized and the colonizers erupted, livestock were frequently killed. The Abenaki saw them as a direct threat to their food supply.

During King William&#x27;s War, on July 18, 1694, the fledgling English colonial settlement was attacked in the Raid on Oyster River by French career soldier Claude-Sébastien de Villieu with about 250 Abenaki from Norridgewock under command of their sagamore Bomazeen (or Bomoseen). In all, 104 inhabitants were killed and 27 taken captive, with half the dwellings, including the garrisons, pillaged and burned to the ground.

Oyster River was part of Dover throughout its first century. The Plantation was granted rights as an independent parish in 1716 and incorporated as a township in 1732 when it was renamed Durham. Rev. Hugh Adams claimed to have proposed the name &quot;Durham&quot; in an address to the General Assembly in 1738. Two of the earliest settlers of Dover were William and Edward Hilton, the direct descendants of Sir William de Hilton, Lord of Hilton Castle in County Durham, England, but there is nothing to prove that Durham was named in their honor.

Benjamin Thompson, a descendant of an early settler, bequeathed his assets and family estate, Warner Farm, to the state for the establishment of an agricultural college. Founded in 1866 in Hanover, the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts moved to Durham in 1893 and became the University of New Hampshire in 1923. Thompson Hall, built in 1892 with an iconic clock tower, is named in his honor. Designed in the Romanesque Revival style by the Concord architectural firm of Dow &amp; Randlett, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.

On October 22, 1999, Durham was the site of a debate between Republican candidates in the 2000 Presidential Election. Future president George W. Bush was present, along with other notable Republicans of the era, such as John McCain, Alan Keyes, Steve Forbes, and Gary Bauer. The debate became the subject of a skit on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; which featured Darrell Hammond playing then President Bill Clinton.

In 2017, Durham became the first community in New Hampshire to recognize Indigenous Peoples&#x27; Day in place of Columbus Day. In 2018, the Oyster River Cooperative School District, which includes Durham, Lee and Madbury, adopted Indigenous Peoples&#x27; Day on its school calendar.

===Libraries===

Over the years the people of Durham have created several libraries:

Durham Social Library (1815–1857): This library was incorporated by act of the New Hampshire Legislature in 1815. The library contained several hundred books and had a membership numbering nearly 50.

Durham Agricultural Library (1862–1881): Formed February 3, 1862, with Benjamin Thompson as president, this library was small (approximately 72 books) and vocationally-based.

Durham Social Library (1881–1892): Organized March 9, 1881, the library had a membership of 80 and several hundred books. In 1883 the Richardson house was purchased to house the library. It eventually merged with the Durham Public Library.

Durham Public Library (1892–1906): Established in 1892 through the provisions of a New Hampshire state act, this was the town&#x27;s first &quot;public&quot; library. It contained more than 3,500 books and eventually merged with the library of the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts.
Library of the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts (1893–): Came to Durham with the arrival of the College in 1893. Initially, the College housed the library in a single room in Thompson Hall. In 1900 Hamilton Smith gave the University $10,000 to construct a library, another $20,000 was obtained from Andrew Carnegie. In 1907—a year after the town and the college agreed to merge their collective library resources—the building (Hamilton Smith Hall) was completed.

Dimond Library (1958): The construction of a new building on the University of New Hampshire&#x27;s campus brought a new library into the modern age. Recognizable columns such as at the Hamilton Smith Hall were replaced with bolder designs that allowed the library to look more towards the future for inspiration.

In March 1997 by a margin of 2–1, Durham voters passed a charter amendment to establish a board of trustees and allow plans for a new library to go forward. In July 1997 a temporary space was found for the new Public Library in a storefront between the dollar store and a pizzeria. Under the guidance of the Trustees and a newly formed Friends of the Library group, many volunteer townspeople come forward to sheetrock, paint, assemble shelves, and unpack and shelve 719 boxes of books. On July 21, 1997, a dedication ceremony was held for the new library, with Governor Jeanne Shaheen as the keynote speaker. It was the first new public library to be established in New Hampshire in almost a century. In July 2013 a new public library building was completed on Madbury Road.

===Police department===
A police force of some manner has served Durham since at least 1848. Durham Police Department is made up of 21 full-time and 2 part-time officers and provides service 24-hours a day.

The Police Department&#x27;s Adopt-A-Cop program was instituted in 1999 to improve relationships between University of New Hampshire fraternities. Each fraternity is assigned a police officer who attends house meetings and events and acts a liaison between the fraternity and the community.

=== Fire department and EMS ===
The first fire department organization in Durham was organized in 1927 and the first salaried firefighter was employed in 1934.

The Durham Fire Department is one of the few fire departments in the country that is funded by both a municipality and a university.

In addition, McGregor Memorial EMS is a regional, non-profit organization delivering emergency medical services and education to the New Hampshire Seacoast area since 1968.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 9.50% of the town. The town is drained by the Oyster River. The highest point in Durham is Beech Hill, at above sea level, located on the town&#x27;s northern border. Durham lies fully within the Piscataqua River (coastal) watershed.

<text>Farmington is a town in Strafford County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 6,722 at the 2020 census. Farmington is home to Blue Job State Forest, the Tebbetts Hill Reservation, and Baxter Lake.

The town center, where 3,824 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as the Farmington census-designated place and is located at the junction of New Hampshire routes 75 and 153.

== History ==
The native Abenaki people called the area &quot;Chemung&quot;, meaning &quot;canoe place&quot;, and used the three rivers—the Cocheco, the Ela, and the Mad—for transportation. They had a camping ground on Meetinghouse Hill, where they built birch bark canoes. Otherwise, the river valley was wilderness, through which the native peoples from the north traveled to and from Lake Winnipesaukee on their way to other areas and hunting grounds.

As European settlement of New Hampshire began to spread, the area that would become Farmington began as the Northwest Parish of Rochester, which was chartered in 1722. As the native peoples became displaced in the regions, they raided area settlements in and around Dover. To stop the raids, in 1721 the colonial assembly in Portsmouth approved construction of a fort at the foot of the lake, with a soldiers&#x27; road built from Dover to supply it. In 1722, Bay Road was surveyed and completed. Along its course the town of Farmington would grow.

The last native attack in the general region occurred in 1748, and by 1749 the Native Americans living in the area had disappeared from either warfare or disease. Farmers cultivated the rocky soil, and gristmills used water power of streams to grind their grain. Sawmills cut the abundant timber, and the first frame house at the village was built in 1782. In 1790, Jonas March from Portsmouth established a store, behind which teamsters unloaded on his dock the lumber he traded. The area became known as &quot;March&#x27;s Dock&quot;, &quot;Farmington Dock&quot;, and finally just &quot;The Dock&quot;.

Inhabitants of the Northwest Parish were taxed to support both the meetinghouse and minister on Rochester Hill about away, a distance which made attendance difficult. A movement began in the 1770s to establish a separate township, and in 1783 a petition for charter was submitted to the state legislature. It was denied, but another petition in 1798 was granted. With about 1,000 inhabitants, Farmington was incorporated. In 1800, a , two-story meetinghouse was erected on Meetinghouse Hill. The same year, John Wingate established a blacksmithy. He would also become proprietor of Wingate&#x27;s Tavern.

In the 19th century, the community developed a prime shoemaking industry, and was one of the first places to use automated machines instead of handwork. In 1836, shoe manufacturing began at a shop on Spring Street built by E. H. Badger, although it was soon abandoned to creditors. Martin Luther Hayes took over the business, and by 1840 was successful enough to enlarge the building. The town would be connected by railroad to Dover in 1849, with the line extended to Alton Bay in 1851. Shoes were shipped to Boston to be sold at semi-annual auctions for 50 cents a pair.

Following the Civil War, the shoe business boomed and numerous factories were built. Farmington was known as &quot;The Shoe Capital of New Hampshire&quot; for some time. Other factories produced knives, knit underwear, wooden boxes, wooden handles and carriages. A large fire in 1875 destroyed much of the center of town, but the community survived. Brushes were manufactured by the F. W. Browne Company, from which Booker T. Washington ordered twelve street brooms in 1915 for use at the Tuskegee Institute. The town was home to five blacksmith shops, a movie theater, and two hotels. The Panic of 1893 closed all but two large shoe factories. Local industries faded in the latter half of the 20th century. Most of the factories were either demolished or converted into other purposes.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Farmington has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 0.95% of the town. The town is drained by the Cochecho River and its tributaries the Ela River, Mad River, and Rattlesnake River. Baxter Lake, on the southeast border, is the largest water body in the town. Part of the Blue Hills Range, foothills of the White Mountains, is in the southwest. The highest point in Farmington is Blue Job Mountain, at above sea level, near the town&#x27;s southwestern border. Farmington lies almost fully within the Piscataqua River (Coastal) watershed, with the westernmost corner of town located in the Merrimack River watershed.

The town is crossed by New Hampshire Routes 11, 75, and 153.

The median age was 39.2 years. For every 100 females, there were 98.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.0 males.

For the period 2012–2016, the estimated annual median income for a household in the town was $52,305, which was 9% below the county average, and 17% below the state average. The median income for a family was $68,693. Male full-time workers had a median income of $45,476 versus $35,958 for females. The per capita income for the town was $26,111. 7.2% of families and 11.5% of the total population were below the poverty line, along with 17.5% of people under the age of 18 and 3.2% of people 65 or older.

Although the town has about the same percentage of population below the poverty line as does the county, the town has a disproportionate share of the county&#x27;s low-income residents living just above the poverty line, and a disproportionately small share of the county&#x27;s affluent households. This means that with changing socio-economic pressures, a larger portion of the town&#x27;s population is at risk of falling into poverty than is the case elsewhere in the county.

<text>Charlestown is a town in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 4,806 at the 2020 census, down from 5,114 at the 2010 census. The town is home to Hubbard State Forest and the headquarters of the Student Conservation Association.

The primary village in town, where 1,078 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined as the Charlestown census-designated place (CDP) and is located along New Hampshire Route 12. The town also includes the villages of North Charlestown, South Charlestown and Hemlock Center.

==History==

The area was first granted on December 31, 1735, by colonial governor Jonathan Belcher of Massachusetts as &quot;Plantation No. 4&quot;, the fourth in a line of townships on the Connecticut Rivers. Settled in 1740, it was the northernmost township, and its 1744 stockade now known as Fort at Number 4 became a strategic military site. On the evening of May 2, 1746, Seth Putnam joined Major Josiah Willard and several soldiers as they escorted women to milk the cows. As they approached the barn, Natives hiding in the bushes opened fire, killing Putnam, &quot;the first victim of [Native] vengeance&quot;. In 1747, during King George&#x27;s War, the fort was besieged for three days by a force of French and Native people. Captain Phineas Stevens and 31 militia stationed at the fort repelled the attack, with their success becoming well-known.

On July 2, 1753, the town was rechartered as &quot;Charlestown&quot; by Governor Benning Wentworth, after Admiral Charles Knowles of the Royal Navy, then governor of Jamaica. Admiral Knowles, in port at Boston during the 1747 siege, sent Captain Stevens a sword to acknowledge his valor. The town responded by naming itself in his honor.

Early in the morning of August 30, 1754, Susannah Willard Johnson along with her husband, her three children, her sister and two neighbors, Peter Labarree and Ebenezer Farnsworth, were captured by Abenaki people, marched to Montreal and incarcerated. Eventually they would all escape or be released and return home.

In 1781, Charlestown briefly joined Vermont because of dissatisfaction with treatment by the New Hampshire government. Returning at the insistence of George Washington, it was incorporated in 1783.

The community developed into a center for law and lawyers, second regionally only to Boston. Its prosperity would be expressed in fine architecture. Sixty-three buildings on Charlestown&#x27;s Main Street are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. They include the Gothic Revival South Parish Church erected by master-builder Stephen Hassam in 1842, St. Luke&#x27;s Church designed by Richard Upjohn in 1863, and the Italianate Town Hall designed in 1872 by Edward Dow, New Hampshire&#x27;s most prominent architect after the Civil War. Dow also designed Thompson Hall, the centerpiece of the University of New Hampshire.

In 1874, the Sullivan Railroad passed through the western side of Charlestown. The tracks are now part of the New England Central Railroad.

A reproduction of the Fort at Number 4 is now a historical site, where military reenactments and musters occur frequently throughout the summer months. Tours are offered of its stockaded parade ground and pioneer-style houses.

==Geography==
Charlestown is located along the Connecticut River, the western border of New Hampshire.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 5.98% of the town. Charlestown is drained by several direct tributaries of the Connecticut River: Ox Brook, the Little Sugar River, Beaver Brook, Clay Brook, Dickerson Brook, and Jabes Meadow Brook. The highest point in town is Sams Hill, at above sea level in the southeast part of town. 

In the Connecticut River in the 1800s were three islands within the limits of the town. Sartwell&#x27;s Island, the largest, containing , was under high cultivation in 1874. The others contained about each. None show on maps today, and were presumably inundated by the power dam built downstream at Bellows Falls.

The central part of town, where 4,735 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined as the Newport census-designated place (CDP) and is located next to the Sugar River at the junction of New Hampshire routes 10 and 11. The town also includes the villages of Kelleyville, Guild, and North Newport.

== History ==

Granted in 1753 by colonial governor Benning Wentworth, the town was named &quot;Grenville&quot; after George Grenville, Prime Minister of Great Britain and brother-in-law of William Pitt. But ongoing hostilities during the French and Indian War, as close as the Fort at Number 4 at Charlestown, delayed settlement. Nevertheless, in 1761 the town was incorporated as &quot;Newport&quot;, for Henry Newport, a distinguished English soldier and statesman.

It was first settled in 1763 by pioneers from North Killingworth, Connecticut. Absalom Kelsey was one of the earliest settlers, on what became later the D.F. Pike farm at the foot of Claremont Hill. At that time, the Connecticut River was the only route for travel, until a road was cut through the wilderness to Charlestown in 1767. The following year, the first gristmill was established. But dissatisfied with treatment by the state government far beyond the mountains, Newport in 1781 joined 33 other towns along the Connecticut River and seceded from New Hampshire to join Vermont. George Washington, however, dissolved their union with Vermont in 1782, and the towns rejoined New Hampshire.

With excellent soil for farming, and abundant water power from the Sugar River and its South Branch to run mills, Newport grew prosperous. The first cotton mill was established by Colonel James D. Wolcott in 1813. Local cabinet making flourished, producing much fine furniture. In 1817, perhaps inspired by the Erie Canal, businessmen proposed digging a canal to connect the Connecticut and Merrimack rivers—beginning with the Sugar River, and using its source, Lake Sunapee, as a reservoir. The plan was abandoned before it got started. In 1871, the Sugar River Railroad connected to Newport from Bradford.

But the Sugar River was recognized as central to industrial development, and in 1820, mill owners from Claremont, Sunapee and Newport united to create the Sunapee Dam Corporation, which built a dam to regulate the river&#x27;s flow, running mill machinery even during drought. This plan worked, and over 120 water wheels would turn along the stream&#x27;s course. By 1859, when the population was 2,020, Newport had three woolen mills and two tanneries. It also had the Sibley Scythe Company, established in 1842, which manufactured the scythes that cleared jungle during construction of the Panama Canal. The company closed in 1929.

The venerable mill town has significant architectural landmarks, including the 1823 South Congregational Church designed by Elias Carter, the Newport Opera House built in 1886, and the Richards Free Library, built as the home of Colonel Seth Mason Richards in 1898.

===Earliest settlers (1766)===

During the summer and fall of 1765, six young men came to Newport from Killingworth, Connecticut, cleared six acres of land each, and, after getting in a crop of rye, returned home and spent the winter. The following year, in June 1766, these men having an addition of two to their number, making eight in all, five having families, came and made the first permanent settlement. No record or tradition is found showing the precise day of their arrival. All accounts agree that they arrived in town Saturday night; that they were detained by a bad place in the road on Pike Hill, where they camped for the night; and the following day, after accomplishing the remainder of their journey, they spent in religious worship under the shadow of a pine tree which stood just south of the A. Pease residence.

The following were among the earliest settlers, the first five having families.

Besides Newport&#x27;s downtown area, settlements within the town include North Newport, Kelleyville (in the western part of the town), Guild (in the eastern part of the town), and Wendell, on the town&#x27;s eastern border with Sunapee.

Newport is drained by the west-flowing Sugar River and its South Branch, with the town center at their confluence. The North Branch joins the Sugar River north of Newport village and east of North Newport. The entire town is part of the Connecticut River watershed. The highest point in town is along its southern border, where an unnamed ridge has an elevation of approximately above sea level.

The town is served by state routes 10, 11 and 103. Newport is home to Parlin Field Airport.

<text>Coeymans is a town in Albany County, New York, United States. The population was 7,256 in the 2020 census, a decline from 7,418 at the 2010 census. The town is named after an early settler, who was the patent-holder for the area. The town is in the southeastern part of the county, south of Albany.

The Powell &amp; Minnock Brick Yard, just north of the Hamlet on Rt. 144, was used as the assembly site for a new swing span for the 145th Street Bridge in 2006. The site was chosen because of a lack of space closer to the city.

== History ==
Barent Pieteres Koijemans first arrived in 1639 from Holland. He became an apprentice at a mill owned by the Van Rensselaers. He purchased the land and obtained a patent in 1673.

Coeymans was formed from part of the town of Watervliet in 1791. In 1815, part of the town was used to create the new town of Westerlo.

<text>Colonie is a town in Albany County, New York, United States. It is the most-populous suburb of Albany, and is the third-largest town in area in Albany County, occupying approximately 11% of the county. Several hamlets exist within the town. As of the 2020 census, the town had a total population of 85,590.

The name is derived from the Dutch &quot;Colonye&quot; or &quot;Colonie&quot;, derived from the Colonie of Rensselaerswyck. All the land outside the Village of Beverwyck (now Albany) was referred to as the &quot;Colonie&quot;. The town of Colonie is north of Albany and is at the northern border of the county. Within the town of Colonie are two villages, one also known as Colonie and the other known as Menands.

==History==
This area was once part of the Rensselaerwyck manor. The town of Colonie was formed in 1895 after the rural residents of the town of Watervliet opposed the state&#x27;s proposal to transform the entire town into the city of Watervliet. The town and village of Green Island was also split off as a town from the town of Watervliet a year later and the village of West Troy that remained became the current city of Watervliet. All debts from the original town were divided proportionally between Green Island, Watervliet, and Colonie. Several lawsuits worked their way through the court system from the results of division. The original town of Watervliet was the &quot;mother of towns&quot; in Albany County, having once been all the land outside of the city of Albany within the county. All current towns either were formed directly or indirectly from a town formed from Watervliet. The central part of the town was once the location of the extensive Shaker community farms. The Watervliet Shaker Historic District is located in Colonie. Much of that land is now occupied by the Albany International Airport. 
Through to the 1930s, Colonie was a simple series of extensive farms and a few hamlets. However, in the post-war years, there was intensive suburban development, originally on the corridor that connected Albany and Schenectady, but quickly following throughout the entire township. By 1980, suburban development had saturated the community. At the same time, there were large highways (I-87, I-787, US Rt. 9 and NY Rt. 7) constructed which drastically changed the nature of the town and life there. The Colonie of the 1990s and beyond has become an entirely-different community from the town of the 1930s and 1940s. 

The Casparus F. Pruyn House at Newtonville is open to the public as the historical and cultural arts center for the Town of Colonie.

Crummey ran unopposed in the 2023 election, being reelected with 14,295 votes.

Crummey&#x27;s election marked a change in political power at the Supervisor&#x27;s position from Democrat to Republican. The outgoing town supervisor Paula Mahan, a Democrat, chose not to seek an eighth two-year term. Mahan was elected to her first term in November 2007, defeating long-time Republican incumbent Mary Brizzell. In November 2009, Mahan was re-elected to a second term, defeating former Republican Albany County Executive/former New York State Senator Michael J. Hoblock. In November 2011, Mahan was re-elected to a third term, defeating former New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner and the former Director of the town&#x27;s Planning and Economic Development Committee, Denise Sheehan, by less than 400 votes. She was re-elected in 2013 to a fourth term by defeating political newcomer Todd A. Drake. 

The town board has six members, with four-year terms; three members are elected every odd-numbered year. The Town Supervisor also serves as a member of the town board.

According to the April 1, 2018, NYS Board of Elections Party Affiliation and Status of active and inactive registered voters in the Town of Colonie, there are approximately 21,000 registered Democrats and 16,000 registered Republicans out of a total of 56,500 registered voters in the 61 election districts within the town.

The seat of Colonie&#x27;s government is Colonie Memorial Town Hall, located on U.S. Route 9 in Newtonville, near Siena College. The town courts, police department, and emergency medical services department are located at the Public Safety Building on Wolf Road near Albany International Airport.

==Public safety==

Law enforcement in the town is primarily provided by the Town of Colonie Police Department; within the village of Menands, which occupies the southeastern corner of the town, there is the Village of Menands Police Department as well. However, that law enforcement is supplemented by the New York State Police Troop G (the headquarters of which lies within the town of Colonie) and the Albany County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, which patrols the Albany International Airport and operates the Albany County Correctional Facilities (which also lie within the town of Colonie).

In November 2007, the town of Colonie was ranked the sixth safest place to live in a Morgan Quitno Publishing study of crime rates across the United States. By November 2009 CQ Press (formerly known as Morgan Quitno Publishing) ranked the town of Colonie with the lowest crime rate of all communities in the United States with a population of at least 75,000 residents. The town held the top spot again in 2010 and has since continuously ranked at the top 10 or better for having the lowest crime rate of all communities in the United States with a population of at least 75,000 residents.

Emergency Medical Service (advanced, basic, and transport) in the town is primarily provided by the Town of Colonie Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Department. The EMS Department operates out of six ambulance stations scattered throughout the town of Colonie to facilitate the most rapid response. The EMS Department also serves as an integral part of any heavy or light technical rescue operations in the town. In 1999, the town of Colonie Emergency Medical Services Department was awarded the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians&#x27; National Paramedic Service of the Year Award. The award is given to one service of high distinction that has demonstrated excellence, innovation and community service.

On May 4, 2010, the town of Colonie was awarded the 2010 International Association of Fire Chiefs&#x27; &quot;Heartsafe Community&quot; award for making significant advances in emergency cardiac care. On August 28, 2010, the New York State EMS Council awarded the town of Colonie Emergency Medical Services Department the New York State &quot;EMS Agency of the Year&quot; award.

Firefighting service in the town is primarily provided by one of twelve (mostly volunteer) firefighting agencies and one paid fire brigade. (&quot;See also Administrative divisions of New York.&quot;)
*Five Fire Districts (Boght Community, Midway, Schuyler Heights, Verdoy, and West Albany).
*One Joint Fire District (Stanford Heights [Niskayuna &amp; Colonie]).
*Four Fire Protection Districts (Fuller Road, Latham, Maplewood, and Shaker Road-Loudonville).
*Two Village Fire Departments (Colonie and Menands).

These agencies encompass seventeen fire stations, two small rescue boats (Boght &amp; Verdoy), seven ladder trucks (Fuller Road, Latham, Menands, Midway, Schuyler Heights, Shaker Road-Loudonville, Stanford Heights, and Verdoy), one Hazardous Materials Specialty Rescue (West Albany), one Trench/Structural Collapse Specialty Rescue (Village of Colonie), one Confined Space Specialty Rescue (Latham), eight General/Light Rescue apparatus, 23 full-size pumpers, a small number of attack pumpers, and a small number of EMS First-Response vehicles.

*One Paid Fire Brigade

The Albany International Airport Fire Brigade consists of a full-time paid crash/fire/rescue staff, three crash/rescue vehicles, a mini pumper, hazmat truck, foam re-supply truck, and a full-size pumper. However, the airport&#x27;s fire units stay on Airport Authority property most of the time, and are housed in yet another fire station that is on the Airport Authority&#x27;s property. Occasionally, the Airport Fire Brigade responds to mutual aid requests with the bordering Shaker Road-Loudonville Fire Department, as well as other fire agencies within the town of Colonie and Albany County.

*Also located in the town of Colonie is a New York sponsored Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) Team, New York Task Force 2 (NY-TF2). NY-TF2 (then known as the New York Regional Response Team-1 {NYRRT-1}) was the first USAR team on site immediately following the attacks on, and collapse of, the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, since many members of NY-TF1 (based in New York City) were members of the FDNY that perished in the collapse. Those same members provided much of the initial training to NY-TF2. 

==Education==
There are six public school districts that serve the town of Colonie: the South Colonie Central School District, North Colonie Central Schools, Watervliet City School District, Menands Union Free School District, Niskayuna Central School District, and Mohonasen Central School District.

South Colonie (Colonie Central High School) serves much of the western part of the town, including West Albany, the village of Colonie, and a small part of the adjoining town of Niskayuna. North Colonie (Shaker High School) serves Latham and the smaller, suburban and rural hamlets to the north of Latham, as well as most of Loudonville and Newtonville. The Watervliet City School District (Watervliet High School) serves some students from Menands and the Schuyler Heights area. Mohonasen&#x27;s (Mohonasen High School) schools serve the sliver of Colonie which lies south of the Amtrak tracks and east of its border with the Town of Rotterdam. Niskayuna Central School District&#x27;s boundaries enter Colonie for the short segment of Vly Rd. east of Denison Rd., and the few streets along this stretch. The Menands Union Free School District is a single building school district serving the village of Menands and educates students from kindergarten through eighth grade. Upon completion of eighth grade, Menands Union Free School District students choose whether to attend Shaker High School, Colonie Central High School, Watervliet, Heatly Junior-Senior High School in Green Island, or Tech Valley High School in Albany. In 2008, the Maplewood-Colonie Common School District merged with, and into the North Colonie School District.

The town of Colonie is also home to the Christian Brothers Academy, as well as several private and/or religious elementary schools. Siena College is located in the hamlet of Loudonville. Bryant &amp; Stratton College, a proprietary college, is in the town of Colonie. Colonie was formerly home to a campus of ITT Technical Institute,

==Recreation==
The Town of Colonie operates and maintains over 850 acres of property and facilities, including the 130-acre Crossings Park, the 160-acre Mohawk River Park and Pool, the 12-acre Mohawk Riverside Landing Park, the 36-hole Town of Colonie Golf Course, the 43-acre Schuyler Flatts Cultural Park, a 5.5 mile section of the Mohawk Hudson Bike/Hike Trail, and other sports facilities and pocket parks.

==Media==
There are two dedicated weekly newspapers for parts of the town, the &quot;Colonie Spotlight&quot; and &quot;Loudonville Spotlight&quot;. Also, Channel 9 on Spectrum News in the town is a public-access television station devoted to town news, programming, and events. The studios are located inside the William K. Sanford town library on Albany Shaker Road.

Although not entirely dedicated to the town of Colonie, the headquarters and distribution center for the Capital Region&#x27;s major daily newspaper, the &quot;Times Union&quot; (owned by the Hearst Corporation), lies within the town.

<text>Alfred is a village located in the town of Alfred in Allegany County, New York, United States. The population was 4,026 at the 2020 census.

The village is home to both Alfred University and Alfred State College. In 2023, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; named it &quot;the collegiest college town in America&quot; due to its high ratio of students to non-students.

Due in part to the New York State College of Ceramics, Alfred has become a hub for ceramic artists and ceramic engineers.

== History ==

===19th century===

The area around Alfred had historically been home to the Seneca tribe. In 1807, three Seventh Day Baptists; Clark Crandall, Nathan Green, and Edward Green, moved to the area with their families, becoming the first of many members of that sect to move to the village and surrounding region.

Alfred&#x27;s name has traditionally been attributed to Alfred the Great, however that has never been definitively verified. For much of its early history the village of Alfred was known as Alfred Centre.

Alfred became home to an institution of higher education in 1832, when Alfred University was founded. The college was coeducational from its inception and tried to provide practical as well as liberal education for students. This university was initially considered the principal seat of higher learning supported by the Seventh Day Baptists although it was not directly supported by the denomination.

The village was a hotbed of support for the abolition movement and during the American Civil War nearly 150 residents fought for the union.

In 1888 the Celadon Terra Cotta Company was founded after the discovery of high-quality clay in the area. The company grew over the next decade to become a leading producer of roof tile and architectural terra cotta. The presence of this and the nearby Alfred Clay Company helped to establish Alfred as a ceramics hub, and led to the local university being selected as the home of the New York State College of Ceramics in 1900.

===20th century===

The new college recruited British ceramicist Charles Fergus Binns as a director and professor. Binns was a proponent of the Arts and Crafts movement and considered it essential for a student of ceramics to understand both the artistic and technical aspects of their craft. Under his leadership the college grew into a leading institution of ceramic studies, eventually developing separate schools for ceramic art and ceramic engineering. As a result of the college&#x27;s prominence, Alfred remained a hub for ceramics even after the burning of the Celadon Terra Cotta Company&#x27;s local factory in 1909.

A statutory agricultural school was formed at Alfred University in 1908, with a farm, livestock, and farm machinery for trade education. In 1937 a school of Engineering Technology was formed at this college, and in 1948 the entire college was spun off from Alfred University to form Alfred State College.

From 1940 to 1957 the village was home to Glidden Pottery, a unique stoneware-bodied dinnerware with designs by founder Glidden Parker, Sergio Dello Strologo, Fong Chow, and others. These pieces were affordable for many, yet showcased unique midcentury modern styles and designs. They have become highly collectable in the years since the pottery&#x27;s closing. 

On April 30, 1972, the village hosted the first Hot Dog Day, organized jointly by Alfred University and Alfred State College students.

==Historic Structures==

Alfred is home to numerous buildings and properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Alumni Hall, Fireman&#x27;s Hall, Steinheim Castle and the Terra Cotta Building. Additionally, 55 properties in Alfred&#x27;s downtown form the Alfred Village Historic District.

==Geography==
Alfred is approximately located at 42.3° north latitude, 77.8° west longitude.

A small stream, Kanakadea Creek, flows through the center of the village, then to the Canisteo River, part of the Susquehanna River watershed. The topography is steep hill country, part of the Allegheny Plateau, a physiographic region that is part of the Appalachian Mountains.

Alfred is located in the hills of western New York along the Southern Tier. The layout of the valley is such that the lowest part contains the village, and upon the hills to the east and west are Alfred University and Alfred State College, respectively. The valley was originally called &quot;Kanakadea&quot; (or &quot;Canakadea&quot;, or other spellings) by Native Americans. 

The elevation of Alfred is about but rises to a high point of at the summit of Jericho Hill just south of the village. The hills greatly affect the weather in the region, which results in quick changes as well as different conditions in neighboring valleys.

<text>Alfred is a town in Allegany County, New York, United States. The population was 4,896 at the 2020 census.

The Town of Alfred has a village named Alfred in the center of the town.

Alfred University and Alfred State College are located in the Village of Alfred.

==History==
===Early history===
&quot;The Seneca Indians were the original owners of this land, but following the American victory in the American Revolutionary War, &quot;all foreign claims of ownership were extinguished, and the power of the Indian Confederacy was broken... but New York and Massachusetts each claimed ownership under conflicting patents. In 1786 New York conceded the lands to Massachusetts but retained the sovereignty.&quot; Ownership of the land changed hands several times until 1791, when &quot;most of the lands of Alfred were sold to the settlers at from $2 to $4 per acre.&quot;

&quot;The earliest settlers followed Indian trails, the chief one leading from Fort Niagara to and down the Canisteo, Chemung and Susquehanna rivers. This passed near the northeastern corner of Alfred and had become well worn by war parties during the Revolution. Settlers from the far east might come by Albany, and the Schoharie and Susquehanna valleys or by Schenectady, Utica, Geneva and Bath. Whatever way they chose the roads were mostly bridgeless and of the most primitive kind, making travel tedious and difficult. From Hornellsville westward for many years the only roads were little more than wood paths marked by &#x27;blazed trees&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;The naming of Alfred has traditionally been attributed to Alfred the Great. That attribution may never be definitively verified because there appears to be no extant document from the period when the town was named that ties it to King Alfred – i.e., no town, county, or state record regarding the source of the name. Despite that missing documentation—There is, however, evidence in support of the legend, and there are no records that point to any other source for the name. Nineteenth-century accounts do cite Alfred the Great as the source. In addition, there was no early settler named Alfred (first or last name) for whom the town might have been named.&quot;

===19th century===

&quot;1807: The first settlers moved in the Alfred area, began clearing forests and building log cabins in order to bring their families in. These settlers were three men – Seventh Day Baptists – from Berlin and Brookfield, New York: Clark Crandall, Nathan Green, and Edward Green. Crandall later became a county judge and joined the state legislature.&quot; 
&quot;The original settlers were mainly Seventh day Baptists. Their first church in this country was organized by members who withdrew from the First Baptist church at Newport, R. I., in 1671. This church was the sixth Baptist church organized in America, and they differed from their mother church only in the observance of the &quot;seventh day,&quot; or Saturday, as the Sabbath. During the latter half of the 17th century, and the whole of the 18th, this people established strong settlements in the southwestern part of Rhode Island, chiefly in Westerly and Hopkinton. Out of these by 1800 grew strong settlements and churches in Rensselaer, Jefferson, Madison, Cortland and other counties of this state. From these out-stations and from the original settlements emigration set westward to the &#x27;Genesee country&#x27;.&quot;

Allegany County was re-organized on March 11, 1808. &quot;At the same time, the town of Alfred was named and organized by the state legislature as one of five towns formed from the larger town (actually co-extensive with the county) of Angelica: Angelica, Alfred, Caneadea, Nunda, and Ossian.&quot;

&quot;The log schoolhouse early sprang up in each neighborhood, and the district school, the singing-school, the spelling-school and the Sabbath-meeting became a part of the life of the community. As prosperity permitted, the large frame-barn took the place of the pole-sided, straw-shingled stable, and a little later the frame house, with its shaved shingle roof, much smaller generally than the barn, replaced the log hut as the family dwelling.&quot; &quot;Amos Crandall, called &#x27;Deacon Crandall&#x27; and originally from Rhode Island, taught school four winters at $10 per month, boarding himself and taking his pay in produce or labor. He was one of the earliest teachers of singing schools in the town, and established the first Sabbath school.&quot;

&quot;The first business of the settlers in Alfred was to make &quot;clearings.&quot; The ashes, carefully saved from the burned fallows and converted into potash, was the first source of revenue. The making of maple sugar supplied home requirement and the surplus, bartered with the merchant, helped to secure needed family supplies. Lumber had little value beyond the cost of making, on account of lack of roads and a market. Those who could hunt could in that way help supply themselves with food, especially if they were fortunate enough to secure the bounty offered for the killing of wolves. Flax was raised, prepared by hand, carded, spun, woven and converted into clothing. When it became possible sheep were raised and their wool formed, entirely by hand processes, into clothing. Few indeed were the early homes into which the cards, the spinning-wheel, the flag-wheel, the quill-wheel, the swifts, the warping-bars, and loom did not find an early entrance. Oxen were in general use because considered more economical and useful than horses. The virgin soil, enriched by the ashes of the burned timber, was highly productive; and when the seasons were favorable, good crops of grain rewarded the farmer&#x27;s toil among the roots and stumps. Year by year the clearings widened, orchards were planted, flocks and herds increased and roads became more passable. Here and there a mill was built, and a few small stores were opened.&quot;

&quot;The first settlers were, for the most part, sons of soldiers of the Revolution, and themselves soldiers of the war of 1812. Alfred&#x27;s sons were conspicuous in the border warfare in Kansas. At the opening of the Rebellion they were prompt to respond to the call for volunteers... The names of nearly 150 of her boys are on her roll of honor. Four or five of the professors and hundreds of Alfred students fought in the Union ranks, many attaining high rank.&quot;

Alfred became home to an institution of higher education in 1832, when Alfred University was founded. The college was coeducational from its inception and tried to provide practical as well as liberal education for students. This university was initially considered the principal seat of higher learning supported by the Seventh Day Baptists although it was not directly supported by the denomination.

In 1888 the Celadon Terra Cotta Company was founded after the discovery of high-quality clay in the town. The company grew over the next decade to become a leading producer of roof tile and architectural terra cotta. &quot;These works have cost $150,000 and employ from 20 to 50 men. Tile of improved patterns excelling any other manufactured in America is shipped to every part of the country. Extensive pressed-brick works have also been established at Alfred Station [by the Alfred Clay Company].&quot; The presence of these two clay manufacturers helped to establish Alfred as a ceramics hub, and led to the local university being selected as the home of the New York State College of Ceramics in 1900.

===20th century===

The new college recruited British ceramicist Charles Fergus Binns as a director and professor. Binns was a proponent of the Arts and Crafts movement and considered it essential for a student of ceramics to understand both the artistic and technical aspects of their craft. Under his leadership the college grew into a leading institution of ceramic studies, eventually developing separate schools for ceramic art and ceramic engineering. As a result of the college&#x27;s prominence, Alfred remained a hub for ceramics even after the burning of the Celadon Terra Cotta Company&#x27;s local factory in 1909.

A statutory agricultural school was formed at Alfred University in 1908, with a farm, livestock, and farm machinery for trade education. In 1937 a school of Engineering Technology was formed at this college, and in 1948 the entire college was spun off from Alfred University to form Alfred State College.

==Higher education==
Alfred is home to three higher educational institutions: Alfred University, Alfred State College, and the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University.

Alfred University was started in 1836, by seventh day Baptists, as part of the Alfred Select teacher&#x27;s college and is one of the oldest coeducational institutions in the US. Alfred University offers more than 40 majors and courses of study in 5 colleges and schools; its enrollment status is approximately 2,000 graduate and undergraduate students each year.

Alfred State College was founded as the New York State College of Agriculture at Alfred University in 1908. In 1948 the state legislature formed the State University of New York system with the Alfred College of Agriculture and Technology, or Ag-Tech, as one of its founding members. Alfred State College has about 3,400 undergraduate students in many areas of study including information technology, nursing, surveying, court reporting, and web development.

The New York State College of Ceramics is a statutory college of the State University of New York operated by Alfred University on behalf of the SUNY Board of Trustees. It was founded in 1900 as the New York State School of Clay-working and Ceramics at Alfred University.

<text>Almond is a village located partially in the town of Almond in Allegany County, and partially in the town of Hornellsville in Steuben County, New York, United States. The population was 466 at the 2010 census.

== History ==

The first people to settle in the Karr Valley area came from Luzerne County, Pennsylvania in 1796. After the legal formation of Allegany County, New York in 1806, the area that would become Almond was initially a part of the town of Alfred, New York. In 1821, Almond was separated from Alfred by an &quot;act of Legislature.&quot;

Notably, the area was not named after the almond tree nut, but rather after the Almond River near Edinburgh, Scotland, from where its settlers came. The village&#x27;s residents pronounce the town&#x27;s name with the Scottish pronunciation, which is closer to &quot;Ellmund&quot;.

In the early 1800s, Almond &quot;thrived... with many mills and factories popping up along the narrow creek and Main Street.&quot; However, the town&#x27;s economic growth was limited by the size of the narrow valley it inhabited, and was reportedly &quot;maxed out&quot; in the 1840s. As a result, new businesses opted to move into neighboring towns like Hornell. By the early 1900s, the town&#x27;s economy had stagnated significantly; old factories burned down and owners opted to rebuild in other locations, rather than in Almond.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 0.6 square mile (1.5 km2), all land.

Canacadea Creek flows through the village. The Southern Tier Expressway (Interstate 86 and New York State Route 17) and New York State Route 21 pass through the village.

==Demographics==

The racial makeup of the village was 97.83% White, 0.87% Asian, 0.87% from other races, and 0.43% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.87% of the population.

There were 194 households, out of which 28.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 46.4% were married couples living together, 11.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 39.2% were non-families. 34.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

<text>Almond is a town in Allegany County, New York, United States. The population was 1,526 at the 2020 census.

The Town of Almond is on the eastern edge of the county. The town has a village also called Almond. The town is west of Hornell and is accessible from Interstate 86 at Exit 33 and New York State Route 21.

==History==

The first part of the town to be settled was near Karrdale in 1796. When Allegany County was established in 1806, the region now in the Town of Almond was part of the Town of Alfred. The Town of Almond was formed in 1821. After Almond was established, parts were removed to form the towns of West Almond and Birdsall.

A history of the area, &quot;The Almond Story - The Early Years&quot;, was published by John Reynolds, Town Historian, in 1962. (Copies are available from the Almond Historical Society, whose website is at https://almondhistory.wordpress.com/ . See also https://www.facebook.com/AlmondHistoricalSociety/ .) According to Mr. Reynolds, the town is named for a place in Scotland, and not for the nut, which would most likely not have been available here in the wilderness when the town was named. Consequently, the pronunciation is not the same as that of the nut: the word Almond properly begins with the same sound as the nearby towns of Alfred, Alma, Addison, and Angelica.

The Almond Historical Society maintains a museum of local history at the Hagadorn House, a large yellow house on the corner by the town&#x27;s only traffic light. The House was built in 1830 and features a large open fireplace and stone oven with original cookware, which had been walled in to conserve heat, but was rediscovered by the last couple to occupy the House, Ken and Marie Hagadorn. These Hagadorns had no children, and left their house to the then-recently formed Historical Society in 1971 to serve as a Museum of treasured furniture, clothing, tools, artwork, and much more. The Society maintains genealogical records and news files for families in the town in the adjacent archives building. The archives are open to the public Fridays from 2 - 4 p.m., and the Museum may be visited at that time or by appointment. The Society holds several open houses throughout the year and publishes a quarterly newsletter.

The Almond 20th Century Club Library had its beginning in 1904, when a small group of energetic and forward-thinking women of the community formed a Reading Circle with weekly meetings. Today, the Library offers up-to-date computers, free wifi, and extensive collections of books, audiobooks, and DVDs for all ages, with access to the resources of the Southern Tier Library System, of which it is a member. It has regular story and craft times for children, a book discussion group for adults, an annual mystery theater, and meeting rooms available for use by the public. The Library&#x27;s historic brick building, constructed in 1912, is in need of major renovation, and various fund-raising activities are being held. Reconstruction is scheduled to begin in the spring of 2020. More information can be found at https://www.facebook.com/almondlibrary or http://almondlibrary.org/ .

==Geography==
The scenic area consists primarily of long, wooded hills with homes and active or abandoned farmland in the valleys between.
