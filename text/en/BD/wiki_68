<text>George Ward Hunt (30 July 1825 – 29 July 1877) was a British statesman of the Conservative Party who was Chancellor of the Exchequer and First Lord of the Admiralty in the first and second ministries of Benjamin Disraeli.

==Early life==
Hunt was born at Buckhurst Park at Winkfield in Berkshire, the eldest son of the Rev. George Hunt of Winkfield, and his wife Emma Gardiner, daughter of Samuel Gardiner of Coombe Lodge, Oxfordshire. His father was rector of Barningham and then Boughton. He was educated at Eton College. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford in 1844. As an undergraduate, he went on vacation reading parties with Arthur Hugh Clough: in 1845 at Grasmere, in 1846 at Castleton of Braemar and in 1847 at Drumnadrochit on Loch Ness. In Clough&#x27;s poem &quot;The Bothie of Toper-na-fuosich&quot;, he is identified with the outsize character Hobbes. Hobbes dances in a kilt, and Hunt painted a self-portrait of himself wearing one.

Hunt graduated B.A. in 1848, and M.A. in 1851; on 21 November of that year he was called to the bar at the Inner Temple.

==Political career==
Hunt entered the House of Commons in 1857 as Member of Parliament for Northamptonshire North, at the end of the year, having made several unsuccessful attempts previously. He was a Secretary to the Treasury from 1866 to 1868, in the ministry of the 14th Earl of Derby. Regarded as &quot;sensible but dull&quot;, according to Derby&#x27;s biographer Hawkins, he was then appointed to the Exchequer when Disraeli took office.

There is a Westminster tradition that, on leaving Downing Street for the House of Commons on Budget Day, the Chancellor of the Exchequer shows the assembled crowd the ministerial red box containing the Budget speech, by holding it aloft. When Hunt presented his one and only Budget speech, he kept the House of Commons waiting, and it is supposed that he had left the speech behind. When he spoke, the Budget presentation was the shortest recorded.

Hunt was appointed to the Admiralty for Disraeli&#x27;s second ministry, serving from 1874 until his death from gout in 1877. Although he was considered competent at finance, his turn at the Admiralty was, for a long time, not much admired. That attitude has, however, been revised. Canada&#x27;s Ward Hunt Island was named for him. It is off Ellesmere Island, and of interest for the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf observed in 1876 by Pelham Aldrich.

Hunt died at Bad Homburg, Germany, in July 1877, on the eve of his 52nd birthday. His wife died in 1894.

==Family==
Hunt married Alice, daughter of the Right Reverend Robert Eden, Bishop of Moray, Ross and Caithness, in 1857. They had five sons and five daughters, including Sir Allen Thomas Hunt, an Admiral in the Royal Navy.

Hunt&#x27;s residence was Wadenhoe House in Northamptonshire.

<text>Skirrid Fawr ( , ), often referred to as just the Skirrid, is a traditional Christian pilgrimage site and an easterly outlier of the Black Mountains in Wales. It forms the easternmost part of the Brecon Beacons National Park. The smaller hill of Ysgyryd Fach or &quot;Little Skirrid&quot; () lies about south.

It is high and lies just to the north-east of Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, about from the English border. The Beacons Way passes along the ridge.

== Geology ==

The distinctive shape of this Old Red Sandstone hill comprises a long ridge oriented nearly north–south, with a jagged western side resulting from ice age landslips . The upper slopes of the hill are composed of Devonian age sandstones assigned to the Senni Formation (formerly known as the &quot;Senni Beds&quot;). These overlie weaker mudstones of the St Maughans Formation - a situation which has contributed to the instability of the hill&#x27;s steep flanks, resulting in extensive landslips, notably affecting the northwestern flanks of the hill. There are numerous other landslips of a similar nature on the nearby hills, although that on the Skirrid is perhaps the most well known owing to its visibility from several directions. Some of the landslide areas contain numerous jumbled blocks of sandstone, one of which is known as the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Table&quot;. The ridge is very similar in its rocky edge to that found on the Black Hill to the north in Herefordshire.

== Cultural associations ==
The Welsh name &quot;Ysgyryd&quot; meaning &#x27;split&#x27; or &#x27;shattered&#x27; and &quot;Fawr&quot; meaning &#x27;great&#x27; describes the hill&#x27;s shape. There is a rich mythology attached to the hill, including a distinctive stone known as the Devil&#x27;s Table. According to legend, part of the hill is said to have been broken off at the moment of the crucifixion of Jesus. There was a local tradition that earth from the Skirrid was holy and especially fertile, and it was taken away to be scattered on fields elsewhere, on coffins, and in the foundations of churches. Christian pilgrimages were traditionally made, especially on Michaelmas Eve, to the summit.

== History ==
In older literature the spelling &quot;Skyrrid&quot; is sometimes encountered and the hill is also referred to locally as the &quot;Holy Mountain&quot; or &quot;Sacred Hill&quot;. The ruins of an Iron Age hill fort and a mediæval chapel, dedicated to St. Michael, lie at the summit. During the religious persecution of the Catholic Church in Wales, which began under Henry VIII and ended only with Catholic Emancipation in 1829, the mountain remained a regular site of Christian pilgrimage. Furthermore, the illegal and underground Jesuit mission based at Cwm and led by future Catholic martyr St. David Lewis, regularly visited the ruined chapel atop Ysgyryd Fawr, which was the site of a Mass rock. In 1676, Pope Clement X promised a plenary indulgence to those who went up the mountain upon Michaelmas. In 1678, local magistrate and priest hunter John Arnold alleged in the House of Commons that, &quot;he hath seen a hundred Papists meet at the top of Skyrrid for Mass.&quot;

Rudolf Hess used to walk here when he was held prisoner at nearby Maindiff Court during the early 1940s.  North of the hill at Llanvihangel Crucorney, The Skirrid Inn claims to be one of the oldest pubs in Wales.

== Ownership and access ==
Ysgyryd Fawr has belonged to the National Trust since 1939. The summit offers views of the Sugar Loaf to the west, and Blorenge to the south, and the ridge is easily accessed on foot from a car park beside the B4521 Ross Road. The ascent is steep initially through woods, but gradual thereafter as open ground is reached. The main path follows the crest of the mountain north to the trig point and chapel remains which mark the summit. A rough path follows the perimeter of the hill at a much lower level.

<doc id="265521" wikidata="Q44614" url="?curid=265521" title="Taiwanese Americans">
<text>Taiwanese Americans (Chinese: 臺灣裔美國人; pinyin: &quot;Táiwān yì měiguó rén&quot;; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: &quot;Tâi-Bí-jîn&quot;) are an ethnic group in the United States consisting of Americans of Taiwanese ancestry, including American-born descendants of migrants from the Republic of China (Taiwan). A 2008 survey by the Taiwanese government placed the Taiwanese American population at approximately 627,000.

Taiwanese Americans are the highest-earning American ethnic group by per capita income and have the highest educational attainment of any ethnic group in the United States. After World War II and the Chinese Civil War, immigrants from Taiwan first began to arrive in the United States, where Taiwanese immigration was shaped by the Hart-Celler Act (1965) and the Taiwan Relations Act (1979). As of the 2010 U.S. Census, 49% of Taiwanese Americans lived in either California, New York, or Texas. 

Notable Taiwanese Americans include billionaire CEOs Jensen Huang (Nvidia), Lisa Su (AMD), and Morris Chang (TSMC); entrepreneurs Jerry Yang (co-founder of Yahoo), Steve Chen (co-founder of YouTube), Tony Hsieh (Zappos); politicians Michelle Wu, Andrew Yang, Lanhee Chen, and Elaine Chao; jurists Goodwin Liu, Florence Pan, and James Ho; HIV/AIDS researcher David Ho, chemist David R. Liu, and Nobel Prize laureates Samuel C. C. Ting and Yuan T. Lee. Taiwanese American celebrities include NBA basketball player Jeremy Lin, singer-songwriter Wang Leehom, and actress Constance Wu.

== Terminology ==
Taiwanese Americans are one of the newest Asian American ethnic groups in the United States. They encompass immigrants to the U.S. from the Republic of China (known as Taiwan), which is primarily located on the island of Formosa, and their American-born descendants. The nation of Taiwan consists mostly of Chinese descendants from the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong and their Fujianese and Hakka subgroups (&quot;benshengren&quot;). As a result, the culture of Taiwan also shares many commonalities with Chinese culture which has often led to the categorization of Taiwanese Americans with Chinese Americans. Taiwanese immigrants, prior to 1982, were listed in the &quot;China-born population&quot; category in the United States census. 

Together, immigrants from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China constitute the three largest groups which form the Chinese American population, each with unique socioeconomic, cultural, and historical backgrounds. The term &quot;Taiwanese American&quot; may be considered a subgroup of &quot;Chinese American&quot;, though multiple Taiwanese ethnic groups—i.e., Taiwanese indigenous peoples or Fujianese descendants from Zhangzhou or Quanzhou—distinguish themselves from mainland China, and the experience of Taiwanese immigrants differ from that of other Chinese immigrant groups. 

The identity of being Taiwanese among both immigrants and descendants in the U.S. has multiple dimensions and has changed over time. Since the leaders, social elites, and affiliates of the nationalist Republic of China (1912–1949), under its Kuomintang government, moved to Taiwan in 1949, Taiwanese Americans also include these mainland Chinese migrants (known as &quot;waishengren&quot;). The group is more closely associated with China and may also identify as Chinese immigrants or Chinese Americans. However, Taiwanese Americans who consider Taiwan to be independent from China favor a separate political and cultural identity and have lobbied to be counted as a distinct population in the United States census.

== History ==
The first Taiwanese immigrants to the United States arrived in the late 19th century, but significant immigration from the island to the U.S. only began in the mid-20th century, when Taiwanese migrants traveled to the U.S. in search of educational opportunities either on the West Coast or East Coast, particularly in scientific fields. After the end of World War II, the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War forced the nationalist Kuomintang government to retreat to Taiwan in 1949. American aid to Taiwan in the wake of the Korean War (1950–1953) supported the Kuomintang government and culminated in the 1954 Mutual Defense Treaty between the United States and the Republic of China, which precipitated a small influx of Taiwanese immigrants to come to the United States. 

From 1949 up until 1979, the United States recognized the Kuomintang-led ROC as the sole legitimate government of China. As a result, immigration from Taiwan was counted under within the same quota for both mainland China and Taiwan. However, because the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) banned emigration to the United States until 1977, the quota for immigrants from China was almost exclusively filled by immigrants from Taiwan. In 1979, the United States broke diplomatic relations with the ROC, while the Taiwan Relations Act gave Taiwan a separate immigration quota from that of the PRC.

Before the late 1960s, immigrants from Taiwan to the United States tended to be &quot;mainland Chinese&quot; who had immigrated to Taiwan with the Kuomintang (KMT) after the fall of mainland China to the Communists. Later immigrants tended to increasingly be Taiwanese &quot;benshengren&quot;, or Han Taiwanese whose ancestors had already lived in Taiwan before 1949. Taiwanese immigration to the United States began to subside in the early-1980s due to improving economic and political conditions in Taiwan.

== Socioeconomics ==
=== Education ===

Taiwanese Americans are the most educated ethnic group in the United States. Both Taiwanese immigrant men and women in the U.S. consist primarily of professionals with high income and high educational attainment. Largely influenced by traditional Confucian beliefs widespread in Taiwan, Taiwanese American culture places the greatest emphasis on education. According to a 2000 survey, children&#x27;s education was considered by Taiwanese couples as a family&#x27;s most important decision.

The main focus of the Taiwanese American family is the achievement of the highest level of education for children, who &quot;are encouraged to study hard and attempt to attend outstanding universities and graduate schools&quot;. In addition to supporting extracurricular activities, Taiwanese American parents &quot;support the development of musical skills over athletic skills [and support] engagement in social causes,&quot; with a large portion choosing to enroll their children in Chinese language schools that teach Chinese culture, history, martial arts, and Standard Chinese as opposed to Southern Min dialects such as Taiwanese Hokkien. Parents devote and invest themselves financially in youth education, especially for boys; a child&#x27;s academic achievements are considered as collective achievements for the family as a whole.

In 2010, 73.7 percent of Taiwanese Americans had earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher, a percentage significantly higher compared to the American average of 17.6 percent. In the 2013 American Community Survey, over 94 percent of Taiwanese Americans had at least a high school degree or higher. As of 2018, in the Chicago metropolitan area, where more than 80 percent of the Taiwanese American population in the Midwestern United States resides, 97 percent of Taiwanese Americans aged 25 years or older had at least a high school diploma and 84 percent had gone on to earn a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher—the highest educational attainment of all other ethnic groups in the area. In 1990, 62 percent of immigrants from Taiwan to the U.S. completed at least four years of college, compared to 46 percent of Hong Kong Americans, 31 percent of immigrants from China, and 21 percent of non-Hispanic whites aged 25 to 64. 
=== Employment and income ===

Taiwanese Americans are the highest-earning ethnic group in the United States by per capita income and are one of the highest-earning American ethnic groups by household income. In 2010, approximately two-thirds of the adult employed Taiwanese American population worked as white-collar professionals and managers who were highly-educated. 

Many Taiwanese Americans are highly educated, salaried professionals whose work is largely self-directed in management, professional and related occupations such as engineering, medicine, investment banking, law, and academia. 66.2% of Taiwanese Americans work in many white collar professions compared to 35.9% for the general American population and 48.1% for Asian Americans. 71.3% of Taiwanese men and 60.4% of Taiwanese women work in management, professional, and related occupations. They also hold some of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation with a figure of 4.3% compared to a national rate of 6.9%. The unemployment rate among Taiwanese Americans is generally low at roughly 5 percent.

According to the 2009 U.S. Census, Taiwanese American men had one of &quot;the highest year-round, full-time median earnings&quot; with a figure of $76,587, while Taiwanese American women had a median income of $51,307. Taiwanese Americans have one of the lowest poverty rates in the US, with a poverty rate of 9.5% compared to 11.3% for the general American population. Taiwanese immigrant men in 1999 earned an average annual income of $60,367 (), the highest of any foreign-born men in the U.S. at the time, and Taiwanese immigrant women earned $40,276 () per year, roughly $10,000 more than the average for other foreign-born U.S. women at the time.

== Settlement ==
The majority of Taiwanese American communities were formed after 1965, following the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, and they have since experienced rapid growth. From 2000 to 2010, the Taiwanese American population increased 59 percent from 144,795 (2000) to 230,382 (2010). In 2013, 59 percent of Taiwanese Americans were between age 18 and age 64, 19 percent were from ages &lt;1 to 17, and 9 percent were over the age of 65. The overall median age was 35. 68 percent of Taiwanese Americans in 2013 were born outside of the United States, of which 67 percent became naturalized U.S. citizens. 

Immigration to the United States from Taiwan has remained substantial. 42,182 immigrant visas were issued to Taiwan from 2001 to 2010, and among those who received legal permanent residency in 2010, 2,090 (40%) were the immediate relatives of U.S. citizens.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Taiwanese emigrants were instrumental in the development of Monterey Park, California in Los Angeles – resulting in the moniker of &quot;Little Taipei&quot; – as well as Flushing, Queens, which generally reflected new investments and capital flowing from Taiwan into newer Taiwanese enclaves instead of traditional Chinatowns. Taiwanese Americans have also brought with them Taiwanese cuisine to the communities they have settled, which, possibly excluding bubble tea, is not generally well known or served outside these aforementioned Taiwanese immigrant enclaves.

While Monterey Park is no longer the largest Taiwanese community in Los Angeles today, Flushing remains the main Taiwanese cultural, commercial, and political center in New York City. In Los Angeles County, California, newer communities such as Rowland Heights, Hacienda Heights, Arcadia, San Marino, Diamond Bar, Walnut, San Gabriel, Temple City, are similar to &quot;Little Taipei.&quot; However, many annual Taiwanese cultural events (especially during Taiwanese Heritage Week) are still held in Monterey Park. As an attempt to duplicate the Taiwanese success of Monterey Park in Houston, Texas, Taiwanese immigrant entrepreneurs established what is now widely considered as Houston&#x27;s new Chinatown on Bellaire Boulevard in the mid-1980s.

The prestige and performance of particular school districts, as well as access to careers in high-tech firms, have played a significant part in influencing the settlement patterns of Taiwanese Americans. Areas with high concentrations of Taiwanese immigrants include the San Gabriel Valley (Greater Los Angeles), Santa Clara Valley (Cupertino, San Jose), East Bay (Dublin, Pleasanton, El Cerrito, Oakland), Los Angeles/Orange County border communities (Cerritos/Artesia), and Irvine in Central Orange County. Outside of California, there are also major Taiwanese concentrations in Flushing, Long Island City, and Forest Hills, all within Queens; Nassau County on Long Island; Jersey City and Hoboken in nearby New Jersey; Rockville, Maryland (northwest of Washington, D.C.); Sugar Land, Texas (near Houston), Plano, Texas (near Dallas); Bellevue, Washington (and adjacent areas) (part of the Greater Seattle Area&#x27;s &quot;Eastside&quot; communities) and Chandler, Arizona. Additionally, the northeastern suburbs of the Atlanta, Georgia area has also received a significant influx of Taiwanese immigrant residents.

From the middle of the 1980s to the 1990s, large numbers of affluent Taiwanese Americans began moving out to upscale neighborhoods such as Cupertino, San Mateo, Palo Alto, Fremont, Newark, and Pleasanton in the Bay Area; San Marino, Arcadia, South Pasadena, and Temple City in Western San Gabriel Valley; Hacienda Heights, Rowland Heights, Walnut, and Diamond Bar in Eastern San Gabriel Valley; with immigrants from the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Cantonese and Teochew (mostly from Vietnam) taking their place in Monterey Park, as well as Alhambra. Starting in the 2000s, highly educated Nassau County on Long Island east of New York City, as well as suburbs in northern and central New Jersey, have received a large influx of Taiwanese immigrants.

===U.S. metropolitan areas with large Taiwanese American populations===
== Organizations ==
The influx of Taiwanese immigrants during the 20th century contributed towards the establishment of multiple immigrant organizations which sponsored local meetings, cultural events, and conferences. The Taiwanese American Association, founded in the 1970s, was among the first organizations to provide a nationwide network of active local Taiwanese chapters in urban areas. Multiple early Taiwanese American organizations were dedicated to the Taiwanese independence movement and to advocacy of democratic reform, such as the Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA), which is based in Washington D.C., and the Formosa Foundation, both of which were established with the aim of supporting Taiwanese political interests and to support the international recognition of Taiwan. 

Other early organizations founded by Taiwanese Americans supported specific economic, cultural, or political interests, including the North American Taiwanese Professors Association (NATPA) founded in 1982, the North American Taiwanese Medical Association (NATMA) founded in 1984, the Taiwanese Americans Citizens&#x27; League founded in 1985 (which has lobbied to count Taiwanese Americans as separate from Chinese Americans), and the North American Taiwanese Women&#x27;s Association (NATWA) founded in 1988.

Organizations founded by, and dedicated to, second-generation Taiwanese Americans include Taiwanese American Professionals (TAP), the Intercollegiate Taiwanese American Students Association (ITASA), and the Junior Taiwanese American Student Association (JTASA), a high school student network. Universities that all house a student association dedicated to Taiwanese Americans include Harvard University, Princeton University, Yale University, Cornell University, Brown University, Johns Hopkins University, New York University, and the University of California, Berkeley. In addition, cities such as San Jose, California; Rosemead, California; San Diego, California; Seattle, Washington; Flushing, New York; and Houston, Texas, have &quot;Taiwan Centers&quot; which host Taiwanese cultural and recreational activities and sponsor programs for youth and seniors.

In 1986, Chaotian Temple from Taiwan has also established a branch temple known as Ma-Tsu Temple in San Francisco Chinatown with the support of Taiwanese American community.

=== Media ===
Taiwanese Americans also run several of North America&#x27;s major Chinese-language newspapers, such as the &quot;World Journal&quot; based in Queens; and the Chicago Chinese News. However, these influential and highly circulated newspapers are not geared solely to Taiwanese immigrants, but also serve a broader Chinese-speaking immigrant readership. &quot;Pacific Journal&quot; is a weekly Taiwanese-run newspaper that is geared more exclusively toward Taiwanese readers.

Due to the significant Taiwanese American community, Taiwanese media dominates the Chinese-language airwaves in the United States. Cable and satellite television of Taiwan-based media keeps Taiwanese Americans abreast of news developments and programming in Taiwan. For example, satellite stations ETTV America and CTI cater to Mandarin-speaking Taiwanese immigrants.

==Taiwanese nationality and residency==


In the 1960s, many Taiwanese Americans chose to make America their permanent home and had children in the U.S. Most sought refuge from the numerous arrests and executions during the White Terror era of the KMT, the political party which had dictatorially ruled the country. By the late 1970s, improving economic conditions in Taiwan slowed the rate of immigration. During the 1990s, political liberalization in Taiwan encouraged many who had left Taiwan to return.

Although the oath of naturalization of the United States contains a statement renouncing &quot;allegiance and fidelity&quot; to other countries, the Republic of China (the formal name of Taiwan) does not recognize this renunciation as sufficient for the termination of ROC nationality, and requires a person who wishes to renounce ROC nationality to take another oath before an ROC consular officer. All renunciations are subject to approval from the Ministry of the Interior, and the Ministry may deny a person&#x27;s application under Taiwanese law. Without formal renunciation, the ROC government considers its emigrants with American citizenship to continue to be nationals of the ROC. Acquiring US citizenship has no effect on the holder&#x27;s status as a national of ROC, which makes Taiwan-born Americans still eligible to vote in the ROC elections, provided that their household registration is still intact in Taiwan.

Unlike their Taiwan-born parents, the American-born second generation do not have household registration in Taiwan at birth, making them nationals without household registration (NWOHRs), despite the fact that they are also ROC nationals under Taiwanese law. In contrast with those with household registration in Taiwan, NWOHRs cannot receive a Taiwanese National Identification Card, do not have right of abode in Taiwan, and are subject to immigration control while in Taiwan. They are, however, eligible for a Taiwan passport. It is possible for NWOHRs to be registered as nationals with household registration (NWHRs) if they meet the requirements listed under the Immigration Act of Taiwan.

== Connection to politics of Taiwan and cultural ties ==
Many Taiwanese Americans play an active role in the politics and culture of Taiwan, aided in large part by recognition of dual citizenship. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Taiwanese Americans are &quot;some of the most determined voters in the world&quot; and several thousand travel back to Taiwan to vote in Taiwanese elections.

The identity politics of Taiwan also influences at least first generation Taiwanese Americans. Many government officials, including presidents Lai Ching-te, Tsai Ing-wen, Ma Ying-jeou, and Lee Teng-hui, have received graduate degrees in the United States. The United States was also a major destination for anti-KMT figures such as Peng Ming-min and Chai Trong-rong, where they were politically exiled. Others, including Nobel Prize laureate Yuan T. Lee were educated in the United States.

<text>The Franklin Mint is a private mint founded by Joseph Segel in 1964 in Wawa, Pennsylvania. The building is in Middletown Township.

The brand name was previously owned by Sequential Brands Group headquartered in New York City. It is currently owned by Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV). The Franklin Mint sells coins, medals, jewelry, die-cast vehicles, dolls, sculpture and other collectibles.

== History ==
For five decades, The Franklin Mint produced and mass-marketed collectibles. Its product line began with manufacturing and marketing privately minted gold and silver commemorative rounds and medallions.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Franklin Mint expanded operations to legal tender coins, producing a combination of bullion and non-bullion proof and uncirculated coin sets of both small and large denominations for a number of countries, particularly Panama and various island states. One of its best numismatic sellers was the &quot;Coin Sets of all Nations&quot; series which included stamps and postmarks of the respective nation on each set.

Besides coins, other offerings included dolls, plates, knives, LP record sets, and die-cast vehicles. Often emphasized in these media were influential historical figures or famous actors. Wildlife scenes were also a common feature. Many of these items were sold through magazine and television advertisements over the years.

== The Franklin Library ==
The Franklin Library produced public domain classic books from its founding in 1973 until its closing in 2000. Its books were designed and bound by The Sloves Organization, Ltd. The Franklin Library published several book series including The Great Books of the Western World and The Hundred Greatest Books of All Time.

== Vehicle models ==
In 1983, after Warner Communications had purchased The Franklin Mint, the company entered the diecast vehicle market, starting with the 1935 Mercedes Benz 500K Roadster. Usually the cars were labeled as Franklin Mint Precision Models. In the following years, Franklin Mint produced more than 600 different issues of motorcycles, trucks, and tractors besides automobiles. In 1998, the mint started producing models of Duesenberg Coupé Simone, a fictitious luxury car allegedly made by Duesenberg in the late 1930s.

Additionally The Franklin Mint began manufacturing diecast aircraft. They produced a large number of World War II 1:48 scale planes including the B-17 Flying Fortress, PBY Catalina, P-51 Mustang, and Focke-Wulf Fw 190.

== &quot;Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund vs Franklin Mint&quot; ==
Following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund was granted intellectual property rights over her image. In 1998, after refusing the Franklin Mint an official license to produce Diana merchandise, the fund sued the company, accusing it of illegally selling Diana dolls, plates and jewelry. In California, where the initial case was tried, a suit to preserve the &quot;right of publicity&quot; may be filed on behalf of a dead person, but only if that person is a Californian. The Memorial Fund therefore filed the lawsuit on behalf of the estate, and upon losing the case, was countersued by Franklin Mint in 2003. In November 2004, the case was settled out of court with the Diana Memorial Fund agreeing to pay £13.5 million to charitable causes on which both sides agreed. In addition to this, the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund had spent a total of close to £4 million in costs and fees relating to this litigation, and as a result froze grants allocated to a number of charities.

<text>A police box is a public telephone kiosk or callbox for the use of members of the police, or for members of the public to contact the police. It was used in some countries, most widely in the United Kingdom throughout the 20th century from the early 1920s. Unlike an ordinary callbox, its telephone was located behind a hinged door so it could be used from the outside by anyone, and the interior of the box was, in effect, a miniature police station for use by police officers to read and fill in reports, take meal breaks and temporarily hold detainees until the arrival of transport.

The typical British police box contained a telephone linked directly to the local police station, allowing patrolling officers to keep in contact with the station, reporting anything unusual or requesting help if necessary. A light on top of the box would flash to alert an officer that they were requested to contact the station. Police boxes were usually blue, with the most notable exception being Glasgow, where they were red until the late 1960s. In addition to a telephone, they contained equipment such as an incident book, a fire extinguisher and a first aid kit. Labelled a &quot;British icon&quot; by the &quot;Plymouth Herald&quot;, the blue Metropolitan Police boxes, designed by Gilbert Mackenzie Trench in 1929, became Britain&#x27;s most recognisable police boxes. The blue police box is associated with the science fiction television programme &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, in which The Doctor&#x27;s time machine, a TARDIS, is disguised as a British police box.

== United Kingdom ==

The first public police telephones in Britain appeared in Glasgow in 1891. These tall, hexagonal, cast-iron boxes were painted red and had large gas lanterns fixed to the roof, as well as a mechanism which enabled the central police station to light the lanterns as signals to police officers in the vicinity to call the station for instructions. As with Chicago&#x27;s boxes, the original intent was that trusted members of the public would be allowed access to the telephone in case of emergency using a special key that was registered to them, which would remain trapped in the lock until released by a master key carried by a policeman. A newer, rectangular type of cast-iron police box was introduced in Glasgow in 1912, but with the signal light now powered by electricity rather than gas, and access to the telephone now restricted solely to the police.

Rectangular, wooden, garden shed style police boxes were introduced in Sunderland in 1923 by Chief Constable Frederick J. Crawley, and then in Newcastle in 1925 when he took over as Chief Constable there. Crawley was arguably the first proponent (at least in Britain) of the concept of the police box as a miniature police station rather than just a communications point, including unrestricted access to the telephone by the general public for contacting police, ambulance, and fire services. His well-publicised success with these boxes, and the revised policing methods they allowed, soon led to the adoption of similar police box systems in many of the larger cities in the north of England, including Manchester and Sheffield.

The Metropolitan Police (Met) introduced police boxes throughout London between 1928 and 1937, and the design that later became the most well-known was created by the Met&#x27;s own surveyor and architect, Gilbert Mackenzie Trench, in 1929. Between 1929 and 1938 around 1,000 examples of the Mackenzie Trench police box were installed. They measured tall, and wide.

=== History ===

Initially, two competing prototype designs were installed on the newly built Becontree Estate in December 1928, with the winning builder being contracted to erect 43 boxes made of wood with concrete roofs in the final Trench pattern as part of experimental installations in the Richmond and Wood Green sub-divisions, which were completed in December 1929 and January 1930 respectively. Their success resulted in the widespread adoption of the system throughout Greater London over the next eight years using newer models of the Mackenzie Trench design now made completely of concrete for increased durability, save the doors, which were still made of teak. Constables complained that the concrete boxes were extremely cold and damp compared to their wooden predecessors, so provisions were made for more powerful heaters. For use by officers, the interiors of the boxes normally contained a stool, a table with drawer, a brush and duster, a fire extinguisher, a first aid kit, and a small electric heater. Like the 19th and early 20th century Glaswegian boxes, the London police boxes had a light at the top of each box, which would flash as a signal to police officers indicating that they should contact the station.
By 1953, there were 685 police boxes on the streets of Greater London, with an additional 72 smaller police posts, also designed by Trench, used in the inner divisions where there was no space for the larger kiosks. Between 1923 and 1960 the police box and/or post system had been adopted by most of the provincial police forces throughout Great Britain. The design and construction of the police boxes used in each system were at the discretion of each individual force, and consequently varied a great deal from location to location, but the police pillars/posts were usually one of three successive models provided by the General Post Office (GPO).

Police boxes continued to play an important role in police work until the late 1960s to early 1970s, when they were phased out following the introduction of personal radios. As the main functions of the boxes were superseded by the rise of portable telecommunications devices like the walkie-talkie and the near universal access by the public to telephones and the 999 emergency number, very few police boxes remain in Britain today. Some have been converted into High Street coffee bars. These are common in Edinburgh, though the city also has dozens that remain untouched — most in various states of disrepair. Edinburgh&#x27;s boxes are relatively large, and are of a rectangular plan, with a design by Ebenezer James MacRae, who was inspired by the city&#x27;s abundance of neoclassical architecture. At their peak there were 86 scattered around the city. In 2012, Lothian and Borders Police sold a further 22, leaving them owning 20.

Beginning in 1933, a slightly simplified version of the Met&#x27;s police box design was also used by the City of Glasgow Police when its old cast-iron police boxes were replaced by an expanded Crawley type of integrated police box system. This was done as part of the restructuring of the force brought about by Percy Sillitoe after he was appointed Chief Constable at the end of 1931. Like the cast-iron boxes before them, the new concrete boxes continued to be painted red until the popularity of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; prompted a change to blue in the late 1960s.

In 1994, Strathclyde Police decided to scrap the remaining Glasgow police boxes. However, owing to the intervention of the Civil Defence &amp; Emergency Service Preservation Trust and the Glasgow Building Preservation Trust, some police boxes were retained and remain today as part of Glasgow&#x27;s architectural heritage. At least five remain—on Great Western Road (at the junction with Queen Margaret Drive and Byres Road); Buchanan Street (at the corner of Royal Bank Place); Wilson Street (at the intersection of Glassford Street, completely restored); one on Sauchiehall street at the junction with West Nile Street and one near the corner of Cathedral Square (at the corner of Castle Street, also restored). There was also a red police box preserved in the Glasgow Museum of Transport but this was returned to the Civil Defence Trust after Glasgow City Council decided it did not fit in with the new Transport Museum. The police boxes in Glasgow on Great Western Road, Cathedral Square, and Buchanan Street are currently under licence to a Glasgow-based coffee outlet. , only the Great Western Road and Buchanan Street boxes have been transformed to dispense beverages, and restrictions are enforced by the Civil Defence &amp; Emergency Service Preservation Trust to prevent the exterior of the boxes from being modified beyond the trademarked design.
The Civil Defence &amp; Emergency Service Preservation Trust now manages 11 of the UK&#x27;s last Gilbert Mackenzie Trench police boxes on behalf of a private collector. Another blue police box of this style is preserved at the National Tramway Museum, Crich, Derbyshire. One of the trust&#x27;s boxes stands outside the Kent Police Museum in Chatham, Kent, and another at Grampian Transport Museum. An original MacKenzie Trench box exists outside of the Metropolitan Police College (Peel Centre) at Hendon.

In the City of London, there are eight non-functioning police &quot;call posts&quot; still in place which are Grade II listed buildings. The City of London Police versions were cast iron rectangular posts, as the streets are too narrow for full sized boxes. One compartment contained the telephone and another locked compartment held a first aid kit. Fifty posts were installed in the &quot;Square Mile&quot; from 1907; they were in use until 1988.
On Thursday 18 April 1996, a new police box based on the Mackenzie Trench design was unveiled outside the Earl&#x27;s Court tube station in London, equipped with CCTV cameras and a telephone to contact police. The telephone ceased to function in April 2000 when London&#x27;s telephone numbers were changed, but the box remained, despite the fact that funding for its upkeep and maintenance had long since been exhausted. In March 2005, the Metropolitan Police resumed funding the refurbishment and maintenance of the box.

Glasgow introduced a new design of police boxes in 2005. The new boxes are not booths but rather computerized kiosks that connect the caller to a police CCTV control room operator. They stand 10 feet in height with a chrome finish and act as 24-hour information points, with three screens providing information on crime prevention, police force recruitment and tourist information.

Manchester also has Help Points similar to those in Glasgow, which contain a siren that is activated upon the emergency button being pressed; this also causes CCTV cameras nearby to focus on the Help Point.

Liverpool has structures similar to police boxes, known as police Help Points, which are essentially an intercom box with a push button mounted below a CCTV camera on a post with a direct line to the police.

Boscombe in Bournemouth opened its own old-style police box in April 2014 in a bid to tackle crime in the area. The box contains a yellow phone for when it is not staffed by police, along with security cameras and a defibrillator.

City of London launched in February 2021 a competition to bring a back a new and updated police box to its streets. Whether if these new boxes will have any similarity to the old London police boxes remains to be seen.

=== In &quot;Doctor Who&quot; ===
The BBC science-fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; features a time machine, the TARDIS, disguised as a Mackenzie Trench-style police box. As police boxes were phased out in the 1970s, over time the image of the blue police box became associated as much with &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as with the police. In 1996, the BBC applied for a trademark to use the blue police box design in merchandising associated with &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. In 1998, the Metropolitan Police filed an objection to the trademark claim, maintaining that they owned the rights to the police box image. In 2002, the Patent Office ruled in favour of the BBC, arguing that there was no evidence that the Metropolitan Police—or any other police force—had ever registered the image as a trademark. In addition, the BBC had been selling merchandise based on the image for over three decades without complaint by the police. The series was revived in 2005, and the police box continues to feature prominently in almost every episode.

The first police telephone was installed in Albany, New York in 1877, one year after Alexander Graham Bell patented the telephone. Call boxes for use by both police and trusted members of the public were first installed in Chicago in 1880, initially housed in kiosks to protect the inner signal boxes from the weather and to limit access to them so as to discourage false alarms. In 1883, Washington, D.C. installed its own system; Detroit installed police call boxes in 1884, and in 1885, Boston followed suit. These were direct line telephones usually placed inside a metal box on a post which could often be accessed by a key or breaking a glass panel. In Chicago, the telephones were restricted to police use, but the boxes also contained a dial mechanism which members of the public could use to signal different types of alarms via telegraph: there were 11 signals, including &quot;Police Wagon Required&quot;, &quot;Thieves&quot;, &quot;Forgers&quot;, &quot;Murder&quot;, &quot;Accident&quot;, &quot;Fire&quot; and &quot;Drunkard&quot;.

<text>William Cullen (; 15 April 17105 February 1790) was a British physician, chemist and agriculturalist from Hamilton, Scotland, who also served as a professor at the Edinburgh Medical School. Cullen was a central figure in the Scottish Enlightenment: He was David Hume&#x27;s physician, and was friends with Joseph Black, Henry Home, Adam Ferguson, John Millar, and Adam Smith, among others.

He was president of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow (1746–47), president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (1773–1775) and first physician to the king in Scotland (1773–1790). He also assisted in obtaining a royal charter for the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh, resulting in the formation of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783.

Cullen was a beloved teacher, and many of his students became influential figures. He kept in contact with many of his students, including Benjamin Rush, a central figure in the founding of the United States of America; John Morgan, who founded the first medical school in the American colonies, the Medical School at the College of Philadelphia; William Withering, the discoverer of digitalis; Sir Gilbert Blane, medical reformer of the Royal Navy; and John Coakley Lettsom, the philanthropist and founder of the Medical Society of London.

Cullen&#x27;s student and later rival John Brown developed the medical system known as Brunonianism, which conflicted with Cullen&#x27;s. The competition between the two systems had knock-on effects in how patients were treated worldwide, especially in Italy and Germany, during the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth century.

Cullen was also an author. He published a number of medical textbooks, mostly for the use of his students, though they were popular in Europe and the American colonies. His best known work was &quot;First Lines of the Practice of Physic&quot;, which was published in a series of editions between 1777 and 1784, and inventing the basis of modern refrigeration.

==Early life==
Cullen was born in Hamilton. His father William was a lawyer retained by the Duke of Hamilton as factor, and his mother was Elizabeth Roberton of Whistlebury. He studied at the Old Grammar School of Hamilton (renamed in 1848 The Hamilton Academy), then, in 1726, began a General Studies arts course at the University of Glasgow. He began his medical training as apprentice to John Paisley, a Glasgow apothecary surgeon, then spent 1729 as surgeon on a merchant vessel trading between London and the Antilles in the West Indies. 

After two years as assistant apothecary to Mr Murray of Henrietta Street, London, he returned to Scotland in 1732 to establish himself in general medical practice in the parish of Shotts, Lanarkshire. Also serving the town of Hamilton he had cured the Duke of Hamilton who thereafter became his patron.

From 1734 to 1736 he studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, where he became interested in chemistry, and was one of the founders of the Royal Medical Society in his first year of study.

In 1736 he began medical practice in Hamilton, where he rapidly acquired a high reputation. He also continued his study of the natural sciences, especially of chemistry. From 1737 to 1740 William Hunter was his resident pupil, and at one time they proposed to enter into partnership. In 1740 Cullen was awarded the degree of MD from Glasgow University. In 1741, he married and started his family. He became ordinary medical attendant to James Douglas, 5th Duke of Hamilton (1703–43), his family, and his livestock. In 1744, following the Duke&#x27;s death, the Cullens moved to Glasgow.

In Glasgow he gave extramural lectures for the university, on physiology, botany, materia medica, and chemistry. His great abilities, enthusiasm, and use of practical demonstrations for instruction, made him a successful and highly popular teacher, attracting large classes. At the same time he also maintained a medical practice. In 1747, Cullen was awarded Britain&#x27;s first independent lectureship in Chemistry and was elected President of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. In 1748 while in Glasgow, Cullen invented the basis for modern refrigeration, although is not credited with a usable application. In 1751 he was appointed Professor of the Practice of Medicine, although he continued to lecture on chemistry.

==Edinburgh==
In 1755 he was enticed by Lord Kames to become Professor of Chemistry and Medicine at the University of Edinburgh in place of Prof Andrew Plummer. It was in Edinburgh, in 1756, that he gave the first documented public demonstration of artificial refrigeration. In 1748, an account had been published in &quot;The Edinburgh Physical and Literary Essays&quot; of an experiment in which Cullen used an air pump to create a partial vacuum over a container of diethyl ether, which then boiled, absorbing heat from the surroundings. This created a small amount of ice, but the process found no commercial application.

From 1757 he delivered lectures on clinical medicine in the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. On the death of Charles Alston in 1760, Cullen at the request of the students undertook to finish his course of lectures on &quot;materia medica&quot;; he delivered an entirely new course, notes of which were published in an unauthorised edition in 1771, but which he re-wrote and issued as &quot;A Treatise on Materia Medica&quot; in 1789.

On the death of Robert Whytt, the professor of the institutes of medicine, in 1766, Cullen accepted the chair, at the same time resigning that of chemistry. In the same year, he had been an unsuccessful candidate for the professorship of the practice of physic (medicine), but subsequently an arrangement was made between him and John Gregory, the successful candidate, by which they both agreed to deliver alternate courses on the theory and practice of medicine. This arrangement continued until the sudden death of Gregory in 1773. Cullen was then appointed sole professor of the practice of physic, and he continued in this office until a few months before his death.

In Edinburgh, Cullen lived off South Grays Close on the Royal Mile close to the old Scottish mint. He had a country residence at Ormiston Hill in Kirknewton, West Lothian.

In 1783 Cullen (together with his sons) was a co-founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

On 8 January 1790 he was presented with a silver platter costing 50 guineas by the Lord Provost, Thomas Elder and the city baillies, for his long service in the university.

He died in his home in the old mint in Edinburgh on 5 February 1790, but is buried in the churchyard at Kirkliston. His son Robert lies with him.

==Influence==

Cullen taught many students who would go on to influential careers in British science. Indeed, a large number of the doctors who taught in Edinburgh&#x27;s medical school from the 1790s to 1810s had studied with him, including the chemist Joseph Black, the anatomist Alexander Monro Secundus, and the naturalist John Walker. Cullen&#x27;s emphasis on the practical benefits of chemistry made his ideas popular amongst farmers, industrialists, naturalists and doctors alike. His influence on these fields was felt through the writings of his students, particularly in the books of John Anderson, the &#x27;Aberdeen Agricola&#x27;, and the lectures given by Joseph Black and John Walker from the 1770s to 1790s.

By studying the symptoms of diseases, Cullen classified diseases into different classes. One class of diseases was called &quot;neuroses.&quot;

== Medical practice ==
In the 18th century, there were three primary professions in medicine: physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries, although the barriers among them were starting to become blurred. William Cullen practiced as all three. Because medical practitioners were not as established as they are now, patients generally took advice from a myriad of sources, including personal experience, books, and several consultations. Furthermore, because the diagnostic tools were not as advanced, patient history was the primary and most important information for the physicians to diagnose their patients. There were no strict government regulations in place for physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries. As a result, to become successful in the medical marketplace depended more on social skills than on medical expertise, similar to other forms of businesses. Cullen was one of the more successful physicians because of his shrewdness in handling difficult patients. Teaching at the university and seeing patients at the Edinburgh Infirmary as charity also helped Cullen become more famous.

Many of Cullen&#x27;s consultations were done through written letters sent by patients from Scottish cities and towns. Cullen managed his consultations with great efficiency; he usually read the letters early in the morning and his secretary-amanuensis would record and mail back his responses. He then went around Edinburgh to visit patients. This form of epistolary consultations was often limited by the literacy and socioeconomic status of the patients. Patients who would write letters to Cullen were usually in the upper and middle class. Besides letters from patients, he also consulted physicians, often students he had taught. Based on how his letters were written, Cullen was most likely a &quot;tactful and compassionate practitioner.&quot; Like many physicians in his time, Cullen would often prescribe therapeutics &quot;to support the patient&#x27;s endangered constitution and assist the body&#x27;s natural healing tendencies.&quot; This is because medical practitioners at the time mostly believed that diseases and illnesses were unique to different patients depending on their constitutions.

== Medical teaching ==
According to Rocca, Cullen was known for systemizing and promoting medical knowledge rather than producing original research. Despite the lack of original work, some believed that Cullen&#x27;s attempt to organize existing knowledge was actually a sign of his &quot;practical sagacity&quot; as a practitioner. He was a lecturer for more than forty years. In order to understand Cullen&#x27;s medical teaching at the time, it is important to understand Cullen&#x27;s conception of &quot;system&quot; as he taught it in his classes. Cullen described a system as &quot;an organised body of opinions on particular topics in the medical curriculum.&quot; He also referred to system as the principles in his book &quot;First Lines of the Practice of Physic.&quot; There were many possible reasons behind Cullen&#x27;s emphasis of the system of medicine. In the 18th century, a period of Scottish Enlightenment, there were competing theories about the mechanisms of the human body and the causes of diseases proposed by different professors, who competed for students&#x27; teaching fees. Thus, having an underlying system of medical knowledge was a practical way to organize the knowledge coherently for the students.

Like many prominent medical figures in the 18th century, William Cullen took a great interest in the nervous system. He defined the nervous system as an &quot;animated machine&quot; whose main function is to &quot;perform a variety of motions,&quot; communicate and interact with &quot;external bodies.&quot; Cullen believed that the nervous system was composed of four elements: the medullary substance, consisting of the brain and the spinal cord, the membranous nerves, the sensory nerves, and the muscular fibers.

Cullen&#x27;s understanding of the nervous system was also influenced by his contemporaries, one of whom was Albrecht von Haller (1708–1777). Haller proposed that tissues, including muscles, were characterized by &quot;irritability&quot; (or contractility), while nerves were characterized by &quot;sensibility&quot; (or feeling). Using Haller&#x27;s characterization, Cullen defined disease &quot;as an excess or deficiency of sensibility.&quot; However, Cullen interpreted sensibility as &quot;muscle mobility and vigour&quot; and diseases were caused by the imbalance of irritability and sensibility. Based on this definition of disease, his therapeutics &quot;either stimulated or sedated the nervous system.&quot; He categorized diseases into four main classes: pyrexiae, neuroses, cachexiae, and locales. Within the classes were nineteen orders and 132 genera. The four orders of neuroses were comata, adynamiae, spasmi and vesaniae. Comata was defined as &quot;a diminution of voluntary motion, with sleep, or a deprivation of the senses.&quot; Adynamiae is defined as &quot;a diminution of the involuntary motions, whether vital or natural.&quot; Spasmi was defined as &quot;irregular motions of the muscles or muscular fibers.&quot; Vesaniae was defined as &quot;disorders of the judgement without any pyrexia or coma.&quot;

Cullen&#x27;s emphasis on the importance of the nervous system was driven by the understanding that the nervous system controls the human body and therefore, &quot;all diseases may, in some sense, be called affections of the nervous system, because, in almost every disease, the nerves are more or less hurt.&quot; Although Cullen&#x27;s nosology did not last very long, Cullen&#x27;s influential teachings on medical knowledge and his attempt to systematize and generalize medical knowledge were integral parts of 18th century Scottish Enlightenment.

==Family==

In 1741 he married Anne (or Anna) Johnstone (died at the mint in 1786).
He was father to the judge Robert Cullen, Lord Cullen and to the physician Henry Cullen. Cullen&#x27;s eldest son Robert became a Scottish judge in 1796 under the title of Lord Cullen later Baron Cullen, and was known for his powers of mimicry.

==Publications==
Because of the wide popularity of Cullen&#x27;s work, many of his publications were translated into a multitude of languages across Europe. Cullen&#x27;s most popular and successful work was his medical textbook &quot;First Lines of the Practice of Physic&quot;, published in two volumes in 1777 and expanded with each edition until it reached four volumes in its final edition (1784).

His first book-length publication was &quot;Synopsis Nosologiae Methodicae&quot; (1769), Cullen&#x27;s very influential nosology, or classification of diseases. His next publication was also a medical textbook, and it dealt with the Institutions of medicine, i.e. medical theory. Its full title was &quot;Institutions of Medicine. Part I. Physiology&quot; (1772) because it focused on physiology, which was traditionally only one part of the Institutions (pathology and therapeutics were also essential parts of medical theory). It went through two more editions (1777 &amp; 1785).

Work on his magnum opus, &quot;First Lines of Practice of Physic&quot;, occupied much of his time in the 1770s and 1780s, but he did manage one final publication. This was his two volume &quot;A Treatise of the Materia Medica&quot; (1789), which was highly valued by other medical practitioners throughout Europe.

Thus, the following works, with their dates of publication (including multiple editions), comprise the majority of Cullen&#x27;s &quot;oeuvre&quot;:

<text>The Juglandaceae are a plant family known as the walnut family. They are trees, or sometimes shrubs, in the order Fagales. Members of this family are native to the Americas, Eurasia, and Southeast Asia.

The nine or ten genera in the family have a total of around 50 species, and include the commercially important nut-producing trees walnut (&quot;Juglans&quot;), pecan (&quot;Carya illinoinensis&quot;), and hickory (&quot;Carya&quot;). The Persian walnut, &quot;Juglans regia&quot;, is one of the major nut crops of the world. Walnut, hickory, and gaulin are also valuable timber trees while pecan wood is also valued as cooking fuel.

==Description==
Members of the walnut family have large, aromatic leaves that are usually alternate, but opposite in &quot;Alfaroa&quot; and &quot;Oreomunnea&quot;. The leaves are pinnately compound or ternate, and usually 20–100 cm long. The trees are wind-pollinated, and the flowers are usually arranged in catkins.

The fruits of the Juglandaceae are often confused with drupes but are accessory fruit because the outer covering of the fruit is technically an involucre and thus not morphologically part of the carpel; this means it cannot be a drupe but is instead a drupe-like nut.

==Taxonomy==
The known living genera are grouped into subfamilies, tribes, and subtribes as follows:

* Subfamily Rhoipteleoideae 
** &quot;Rhoiptelea&quot; 
* Subfamily Engelhardioideae 
** &quot;Alfaroa&quot; —gaulin
** &quot;Engelhardia&quot; —cheo
** &quot;Oreomunnea&quot; 
* Subfamily Juglandoideae 
** Tribe Platycaryeae 
*** &quot;Platycarya&quot; 
** Tribe Juglandeae 
*** Subtribe Caryinae 
**** &quot;Carya&quot; —hickory and pecan
**** &quot;Annamocarya&quot; (sometimes included in &quot;Carya&quot;)
*** Subtribe Juglandinae 
**** &quot;Cyclocarya&quot; —wheel wingnut
**** &quot;Juglans&quot; —walnut
**** &quot;Pterocarya&quot; —wingnut

==Systematics==
Modern molecular phylogenetics suggest the following relationships:

<text>Juglandales is an order of flowering plants. This order was recognised in several systems (e.g. Engler system and Wettstein system). The Cronquist system placed the order in the subclass Hamamelidae, as comprising the families Juglandaceae and Rhoipteleaceae, the latter consisting of only a single species.

In the APG II system these two families are united into family Juglandaceae (with the split into two families being optional), and the family is placed in the order Fagales.

<doc id="265537" wikidata="Q999109" url="?curid=265537" title="Port Arthur, Tasmania">
<text>Port Arthur is a town and former convict settlement on the Tasman Peninsula, in Tasmania, Australia. It is located approximately southeast of the state capital, Hobart.

The site forms part of the Australian Convict Sites, a World Heritage property consisting of 11 remnant penal sites originally built within the British Empire during the 18th and 19th centuries on fertile Australian coastal strips. Collectively, these sites, including Port Arthur, are described by UNESCO as &quot;... the best surviving examples of large-scale convict transportation and the colonial expansion of European powers through the presence and labour of convicts.&quot;

In 1996, the town was the scene of the Port Arthur massacre, the worst instance of mass murder in post-colonial Australian history.

==History==

Port Arthur was named after George Arthur, the lieutenant governor of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. The settlement started as a timber station in 1830, but it is best known for being a penal colony.

===Penal colony===
The Port Arthur convict settlement was established in September 1830 as a timber-getting camp,
producing sawn logs for government projects. From 1833 until 1877, it was the destination for those deemed the most hardened of transported convicts ― so-called &quot;secondary offenders&quot; ― who had persistently re-offended during their time in Australia. The recalcitrant offenders were sent to Port Arthur, which had some of the strictest security measures in the British penal system but was, nevertheless, also based on the idea that prisoners could be reformed while still being punished.

====Treatment of prisoners====
Port Arthur was an example of the &quot;Separate Prison Typology&quot; (sometimes known as the model prison), which emerged from Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s theories and his panopticon. The prison was completed in 1853, and extended in 1855. The layout was fairly symmetrical. It was in a cross shape with exercise yards at each corner. The prisoner wings were each connected to the surveillance core of the prison, as well as the chapel in the centre hall. From the surveillance hub, each wing could be clearly seen, although individual cells could not. In that way, the Separate Prison at Port Arthur differed from the original theory of the panopticon.

The Separate Prison System also signalled a shift from physical punishment to psychological punishment. The hard corporal punishment, such as whippings, used in other penal stations, was thought to only serve to harden criminals, and did nothing to turn them from their immoral ways. For example, food was used to reward well-behaved prisoners and as punishment for troublemakers. As a reward, a prisoner could receive larger amounts of food or even luxury items such as tea, sugar, and tobacco. As punishment, the prisoners would receive the bare minimum of bread and water. Under this system of punishment, the &quot;Silent System&quot; was implemented in the building. Here, prisoners were hooded and made to stay silent; this was supposed to allow time for the prisoner to reflect upon the actions which had brought him there. Many of the prisoners in the Separate Prison developed mental illness from the lack of light and sound. This was an unintended outcome, although the asylum was built next to the Separate Prison. In many ways, Port Arthur was the model for the penal reform movement, despite the shipping, housing, and use of convicts as slave-labour being as harsh, or worse, than other institutions around the nation.

====Activities of prisoners====
Port Arthur was also the destination for juvenile convicts, receiving many boys, some as young as nine. The boys were separated from the main convict population and kept on Point Puer, the British Empire&#x27;s second boys&#x27; prison. Like the adults, the boys were used in hard labour such as stone cutting and construction. One of the buildings constructed was one of Australia&#x27;s first non-denominational churches, built in a Gothic Revival style. Attendance at the weekly Sunday service was compulsory for the prison population. Critics of the new system noted that it seemed to have negligible impact on a prisoner&#x27;s reformation.

The archaeology of Port Arthur reveals the relatively mundane activities of everyday life. Not only did the people living there help prepare food, but they also participated in recreational activities such as smoking and hunting. Archaeological excavation of the Port Arthur workshops complex is overseen by the Port Arthur Historic Site Management Authority (PAHSMA). These workshops, situated on the original waterfront since 1830, housed the trades-focussed activities undertaken at the penal station including shoemakers, blacksmiths, tailors, turners and wheelwrights. A journal of the ongoing excavation and conservation work at Port Arthur is documented online by Dr Richard Tuffin. 

A number of ongoing archaeological and historical research projects at Port Arthur include interactive web mapping of convict offences by the University of New England as part of their Convict Landscapes project, and the Founders and Survivors project to digitise Tasmania&#x27;s past. The &quot;Landscapes of Production and Punishment: the Tasman Peninsula 1830-77&quot; project funded by the Australian Research Council, in partnership with the Port Arthur Historic Site Management Authority, continues to examine the convict system from the perspective of convicts as workers. GIS mapping of location and offence data compiled by Dr Richard Tuffin uses the buildings, work sites, products and life outcomes to understand the convicts’ lives and labours whilst under sentence.

==Geography==
The peninsula on which Port Arthur is located is a naturally secure site by being surrounded by water (rumoured by the administration to be shark-infested). The 30-m-wide isthmus of Eaglehawk Neck that was the only connection to the mainland was fenced and guarded by soldiers, traps, and dogs.

Shore-based and ship-based whaling was banned in the area to prevent convicts trying to escape in the boats. Officers at Port Arthur sometimes set out in their own boats and attempted to catch whales. This may have been more for sport than as a commercial activity.

Smooth Island in Norfolk Bay was most likely used to grow fresh vegetables for the Port Arthur penal settlement.

Radcliffe Creek drains the immediate area of Port Arthur into Carnarvon Bay.

===Transport===
Contact between visiting seamen and prisoners was barred. Ships had to check in their sails and oars upon landing to prevent any escapes. However, many attempts were made, and some were successful. Boats were seized and rowed or sailed long distances to freedom.

Port Arthur was the birthplace of rail transport in Australia. In 1836, a tramway was established between Taranna and a jetty in Long Bay, north of Port Arthur. The sole propulsion was convicts. One of the last remaining sections of the tramway can be viewed at the Federation Chocolate Factory at Taranna.

===Reputation and perception===
Port Arthur was sold as an inescapable prison, much like the later Alcatraz Island in the United States. Some prisoners were not discouraged by this, and tried to escape. Martin Cash successfully escaped along with two others.

Despite its reputation as a pioneering institution for the new, enlightened view of imprisonment, Port Arthur was still in reality as harsh and brutal as other penal settlements. Some critics might even suggest that its use of psychological punishment, compounded with no hope of escape, made it one of the worst. Some tales suggest that prisoners committed murder (an offence punishable by death) just to escape the desolation of life at the camp. The Isle of the Dead was the destination for all who died inside the prison camps. Of the 1,646 graves recorded to exist there, only 180, those of prison staff and military personnel, are marked. The prison closed in 1877.

==Tourism development==
Before Port Arthur was abandoned as a prison in 1877, some people saw the potential tourist attraction. David Burn, who visited the prison in 1842, was awed by the peninsula&#x27;s beauty and believed that many would come to visit it. This opinion was not shared by all. For example, Anthony Trollope in 1872 declared that no man desired to see the &quot;strange ruins&quot; of Port Arthur.

After the prison closed, much of the property was put up for auction. However, most of the property was not sold until 1889. By this time, the area had become increasingly popular and the prison buildings were in decay. As the&quot; Hobart Mercury&quot; proclaimed, &quot;the buildings themselves are fast going to decay, and in a few years will attract nobody; for they will be ruins without anything to make them worthy of respect, or even remembrance.&quot; The Model Prison was purchased by Anglican church minister and politician Joseph Woollnough, who operated tours and donated the proceeds to the church.

The decay was seen as something positive, as the Tasmanian population wished to distance themselves from the dark image of Port Arthur. Those who bought Port Arthur property began tearing down the buildings, the destruction was furthered by the fires of 1895 and 1897, which destroyed the old prison house, and earth tremors. In place of the Prison Port Arthur, the town of Carnarvon was born. The town was named after the British Secretary of State and the population was said to be &quot;refined and intellectual&quot;. The town brought in many visitors as they encouraged boating, fishing, and shooting in the natural beauty of the peninsula. They again wished to remove the negative connotation attached to the area.

Despite this wish, the haunting stories of Port Arthur prisoners and circulating ghost stories brought popularity to the remaining prison ruins. This was helped by the popular novels &quot;For the Term of His Natural Life&quot; (1874) by Marcus Clarke and &quot;The Broad Arrow&quot; (1859) by Caroline Leakey, which concerned themselves about convicts in Port Arthur.

In 1927, tourism had grown to the point where the area&#x27;s name was reverted to Port Arthur. In 1916, the Scenery Preservation Board (SPB) was established to take the management of Port Arthur out of the hands of the locals. By the 1970s, the National Parks and Wildlife Service began managing the site.

In 1979, funding was received to preserve the site as a tourist destination, due to its historical significance. The &quot;working&quot; elements of the Port Arthur community, such as the post office and municipal offices, were moved to nearby Nubeena. Several sandstone structures, built by convicts working under hard labour conditions, were cleaned of ivy overgrowth and restored to a condition similar to their appearance in the 19th century. Buildings include the &quot;Model Prison&quot;, the Guard Tower, the Church, and the remnants of the main penitentiary. The buildings are surrounded by lush, green parkland. The graves on the Isle of the Dead also attract visitors.

Point Puer, across the harbour from the main settlement, was the site of the first boys&#x27; reformatory in the British Empire. Boys sent there were given some basic education, and taught trade skills.

===Conservation management===
Since 1987, the site has been managed by the Port Arthur Historic Site Management Authority, with conservation works funded by the Tasmanian government and the admission fees paid by visitors. Volunteer groups have been working at the building sites of Point Puer to help researchers gain a better understanding of the history of the boys&#x27; prison.

The World Heritage Committee of UNESCO inscribed the Port Arthur Historic Site and the Coal Mines Historic Site onto the World Heritage Register on 31 July 2010, as part of the Australian Convict Sites World Heritage property. Port Arthur is one of Australia&#x27;s most visited historical sites, receiving over 250,000 visitors each year.

==Massacre==

On 28 April 1996, the Port Arthur historic site was the location of a massacre. Martin Bryant murdered 35 people and wounded 23 more before being captured by the Special Operations Group. The killing spree led to a national restriction on high capacity semiautomatic shotguns and rifles. The 28-year-old perpetrator was subsequently convicted and is currently serving 35 life sentences plus 135 years without parole in the psychiatric wing of Risdon Prison in Hobart, Tasmania.

<text>Zonguldak Province () is a province along the western Black Sea coast region of Turkey. Its area is 3,342 km2, and its population is 588,510 (2022). Its adjacent provinces are Düzce to the southwest, Bolu to the south, Karabük to the southeast, and Bartın to the east. The capital is Zonguldak. Its Governor is Osman Hacıbektaşoğlu.

== Districts ==

Zonguldak province is divided into 8 districts (capital district in bold):
* Alaplı
* Çaycuma
* Devrek
* Ereğli
* Gökçebey
* Kilimli
* Kozlu
* Zonguldak
== Coal ==

The discovery of coal in the Ereğli (Heraclea) region (known today as the Zonguldak basin) dates back to the reign of Sultan Mahmud II, and its extraction to Sultan Abdulmejid I&#x27;s reign.

The first specimen of Turkish coal was brought from Ereğli to Istanbul in 1822, but nothing was done for exploration and exploitation of this coal. However, in 1829, another specimen of coal was brought to Istanbul by Uzun (Long) Mehmet, a sailor and native of the village of Kestaneci, near Ereğli. This time attention was given to the discovery and the sailor received a reward of a life pension, but before he could benefit from this reward he was murdered.

The first miners requested and delivered from the Austrian Government are the Austrian Croats known to have been employed in the Ereğli Coal Mines. The correspondence between Istanbul and the embassy in Vienna show that coal production in the Ereğli Basin predates the March 1837 request by 18 months and that production started around September 1835.

An investigation of Hazine-i Hassa (Ottoman Imperial Treasury Department) records in the Ottoman archives shows that regular mining activities in the Ereğli Basin started in February 1841. This is confirmed by a newspaper article published in the 14 February 1841 issue of Ceride-i Havadis.

Ereğli Coal Company, chartered by six partners (Ahmed Fethi Pasha, Rıza Pasha, Safveti Pasha, Tahir Bey Efendi, Izzet Pasha and Mustafa Efendi), excavated the coal in the Ereğli Coal Basin, initially under the auspices of Darphane-i Amire and later transferred to Hazine-i Hassa when the latter was established in 1849.

<doc id="265543" wikidata="Q123934" url="?curid=265543" title="Muğla Province">
<text>Muğla Province (, ) is a province and metropolitan municipality of Turkey, at the country&#x27;s southwestern corner, on the Aegean Sea. Its area is 12,654 km2, and its population is 1,048,185 (2022). Its seat is the city of Muğla, about inland, while some of Turkey&#x27;s largest holiday resorts, such as Bodrum, Ölüdeniz, Marmaris and Fethiye, lie on the coast.

==Geography==
At , Muğla&#x27;s coastline is the longest among the Provinces of Turkey and is home to the Datça Peninsula. As well as the sea, Muğla has two large lakes, Lake Bafa in the district of Milas and Lake Köyceğiz. The landscape consists of pot-shaped small plains surrounded by mountains, formed by depressions in the Neogene. These include the plain of the city of Muğla itself, Yeşilyurt, Ula, Gülağzı, Yerkesik, Akkaya, and Yenice. Until the recent building of highways, transport from these plains to either the coast or inland was quite arduous, and thus each locality remained an isolated culture of its own. Contact with the outside world was through one of the three difficult passes: northwest to Milas, north to the Menderes plain through Gökbel, or northeast to Tavas.

===Environment===
Despite court decisions upheld by the ECHR, as of 2020, the Yatağan, Yeniköy and Kemerköy coal-fired power stations continue operations as a major source of pollution in the area.

===Transportation===
Muğla province is served by land, sea, and air connections. As a costal province, it is home to several marinas and ports.

* There are two airports in Dalaman and Milas-Bodrum, serving domestic and international flights and catering to the tourism industry.
* There are yacht marinas in Bodrum, Marmaris, Fethiye and Güllük.
* There are many privately run bus connections to İzmir, Antalya, Ankara, Istanbul and other major cities in Turkey both from Muğla and directly from the coastal resorts.

==History==

In ancient Anatolia, the region between the Menderes and Dalaman rivers in the south was called Caria. Caria was inhabited by the eponymous Carians and the Leleges. In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Homer described the Carians as natives of Anatolia, defending their country against the Greeks in joint campaigns in collaboration with the Trojans.

A major city of ancient Caria, Muğla is known to have been occupied by raiding parties of Egyptians, Assyrians and Scythians, until eventually the area was settled by Ancient Greek colonists. The Greeks inhabited this coast for a long time and built prominent cities, such as Knidos (at the end of the Datça Peninsula) and Bodrum (Halicarnassos), as well as many smaller towns along the coast of the Bodrum Peninsula and surrounding islands. In the district of Fethiye, ruins remain of the cities of Telmessos, Xanthos, Patara and Tlos. Eventually the coast was conquered by the Persians who were in turn removed by Alexander the Great, bringing an end to the satrapy of Caria.

In 1261, Menteshe Bey, founder of the Beylik (principality) that carried his name, with its capital in Milas and nearby Beçin, established his rule over the region of Muğla as well. The beys of Menteshe held the city until 1390 and were the first Turkish state in the region. They a

In 1390, Muğla was taken over by the Ottoman Empire. However, just twelve years later, Tamerlane and his forces defeated the Ottomans in the Battle of Ankara, and returned control of the region to its former rulers, the Menteshe Beys, as he did for other Anatolian beyliks. Muğla was brought back under Ottoman control by Sultan Mehmed II the Conqueror, in 1451. One of the most important events in the area during the Ottoman period was the well-recorded campaign of Suleiman the Magnificent against Rhodes, which was launched from Marmaris.

=== Archaeology ===

With this long history Muğla is rich in ancient ruins, with over 100 excavated sites including the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Letoon, near Fethiye.

In 2018, archaeologists unearthed a 2,300-year-old rock sepulchre of an ancient Greek boxer called Diagoras of Rhodes on a hill in the Turgut village, Muğla province, Marmaris. This unusual pyramid tomb was considered to belong to a holy person by the local people. The shrine, used as a pilgrimage by locals until the 1970s, also has the potential to be the only pyramid grave in Turkey. The excavation team also discovered an inscription with these words: &quot;“I will be vigilant at the very top so as to ensure that no coward can come and destroy this grave&quot;.&quot;

In July 2021, archaeologists led by Abuzer Kızıl have announced the discovery of two 2,500-year-old marble statues and an inscription during excavations at the Temple of Zeus Lepsynos in Euromus. According to Abuzer Kızıl, one of the statues was naked while other was wearing armor made of leather and a short skirt. Both of the statues were depicted with a lion in their hands.

<doc id="265551" wikidata="Q30715253" url="?curid=265551" title="X-ray machine">
<text>An X-ray machine is a device that uses X-rays for a variety of applications including medicine, X-ray fluorescence, electronic assembly inspection, and measurement of material thickness in manufacturing operations. In medical applications, X-ray machines are used by radiographers to acquire x-ray images of the internal structures (e.g., bones) of living organisms, and also in sterilization.

==Structure==

An X-ray generator generally contains an X-ray tube to produce the X-rays. Possibly, radioisotopes can also be used to generate X-rays.

An X-ray tube is a simple vacuum tube that contains a cathode, which directs a stream of electrons into a vacuum, and an anode, which collects the electrons and is made of tungsten to evacuate the heat generated by the collision. When the electrons collide with the target, about 1% of the resulting energy is emitted as X-rays, with the remaining 99% released as heat. Due to the high energy of the electrons that reach relativistic speeds, the target is usually made of tungsten even if other material can be used particularly in XRF applications.

An X-ray generator also needs to contain a cooling system to cool the anode; many X-ray generators use water or oil recirculating systems.

===Medical imaging===

In medical imaging applications, an X-ray machine has a control console that is used by a radiologic technologist to select X-ray techniques suitable for the specific exam, a power supply that creates and produces the desired kVp (peak kilovoltage), mA (milliamperes, sometimes referred to as mAs which is actually mA multiplied by the desired exposure length) for the X-ray tube, and the X-ray tube itself.

==History==
The discovery of X-rays came from experimenting with Crookes tubes, an early experimental electrical discharge tube invented by English physicist William Crookes around 1869–1875. In 1895, Wilhelm Röntgen discovered X-rays emanating from Crookes tubes and the many uses for X-rays were immediately apparent. One of the first X-ray photographs was made of the hand of Röntgen&#x27;s wife. The image displayed both her wedding ring and bones. On January 18, 1896 an &quot;X-ray machine&quot; was formally displayed by Henry Louis Smith. A fully functioning unit was introduced to the public at the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair by Clarence Dally. The technology developed quickly: In 1909 Mónico Sánchez Moreno had produced the first portable medical device and during World War I Marie Curie led the development of X-ray machines mounted in &quot;radiological cars&quot; to provide mobile X-ray services for military field hospitals.

In the 1940s and 1950s, X-ray machines were used in stores to help sell footwear. These were known as Shoe-fitting fluoroscopes. However, as the harmful effects of X-ray radiation were properly considered, they finally fell out of use. Shoe-fitting use of the device was first banned by the state of Pennsylvania in 1957. (They were more a clever marketing tool to attract customers, rather than a fitting aid.) Together with Robert J. Van de Graaff, John G. Trump developed one of the first million-volt X-ray generators.

An X-ray imaging system consists of a generator control console where the operator selects desired techniques to obtain a quality readable image(kVp, mA and exposure time), an x-ray generator which controls the x-ray tube current, x-ray tube kilovoltage and x-ray emitting exposure time, an X-ray tube that converts the kilovoltage and mA into actual x-rays and an image detection system which can be either a film (analog technology) or a digital capture system and a PACS.

==Applications==
X-ray machines are used in health care for visualising bone structures, during surgeries (especially orthopedic) to assist surgeons in reattaching broken bones with screws or structural plates, assisting cardiologists in locating blocked arteries and guiding stent placements or performing angioplasties and for other dense tissues such as tumours. Non-medicinal applications include security and material analysis.

===Medicine===

The main fields in which x-ray machines are used in medicine are radiography, radiotherapy, and fluoroscopic-type procedures. Radiography is generally used for fast, highly penetrating images, and is usually used in areas with a high bone content but can also be used to look for tumors such as with mammography imaging. Some forms of radiography include:
*orthopantomogram — a panoramic x-ray of the jaw showing all the teeth at once
*mammography — x-rays of breast tissue
*tomography — x-ray imaging in sections
In fluoroscopy, imaging of the digestive tract is done with the help of a radiocontrast agent such as barium sulfate, which is opaque to X-rays.

Radiotherapy — the use of x-ray radiation to treat malignant and benign cancer cells, a non-imaging application

Fluoroscopy is used in cases where real-time visualization is necessary (and is most commonly encountered in everyday life at airport security). Some medical applications of fluoroscopy include:
*angiography — used to examine blood vessels in real time along with the placement of stents and other procedures to repair blocked arteries.
*barium enema — a procedure used to examine problems of the colon and lower gastrointestinal tract
*barium swallow — similar to a barium enema, but used to examine the upper gastrointestinal tract
*biopsy — the removal of tissue for examination
*Pain Management - used to visually see and guide needles for administering/injecting pain medications, steroids or pain blocking medications throughout the spinal region.
*Orthopedic procedures - used to guide placement and removal of bone structure reinforcement plates, rods and fastening hardware used to aide the healing process and alignment of bone structures healing properly together. 
X-rays are highly penetrating, ionizing radiation, therefore X-ray machines are used to take pictures of dense tissues such as bones and teeth. This is because bones absorb the radiation more than the less dense soft tissue. X-rays from a source pass through the body and onto a photographic cassette. Areas where radiation is absorbed show up as lighter shades of grey (closer to white). This can be used to diagnose broken or fractured bones.

In 2012, European Commission of Radiation Protection set leakage radiation limit from X-ray generators such as X-ray tubes and CT machines as one mGy/hour at one metre distance from the machine.

=== Security ===

X-ray machines are used to screen objects non-invasively. Luggage at airports and student baggage at some schools are examined for possible weapons, including bombs. Prices of these Luggage X-rays vary from $50,000 to $300,000. The main parts of an X-ray Baggage Inspection System are the generator used to generate x-rays, the detector to detect radiation after passing through the baggage, signal processor unit (usually a PC) to process the incoming signal from the detector, and a conveyor system for moving baggage into the system. Portable pulsed X-ray Battery Powered X-ray Generator used in Security as shown in the figure provides EOD responders safer analysis of any possible target hazard.

==== Operation ====
When baggage is placed on the conveyor, it is moved into the machine by the operator. There is an infrared transmitter and receiver assembly to detect the baggage when it enters the tunnel. This assembly gives the signal to switch on the generator and signal processing system. The signal processing system processes incoming signals from the detector and reproduce an image based upon the type of material and material density inside the baggage. This image is then sent to the display unit.

==== Color classification ====

The colour of the image displayed depends upon the material and material density : organic material such as paper, clothes and most explosives are displayed in orange. Mixed materials such as aluminum are displayed in green. Inorganic materials such as copper are displayed in blue and non-penetrable items are displayed in black (some machines display this as a yellowish green or red). The darkness of the color depends upon the density or thickness of the material.

The material density determination is achieved by two-layer detector. The layers of the detector pixels are separated with a strip of metal. The metal absorbs soft rays, letting the shorter, more penetrating wavelengths through to the bottom layer of detectors, turning the detector to a crude two-band spectrometer.

==Advances in X-ray technology==

A film of carbon nanotubes (as a cathode) that emits electrons at room temperature when exposed to an electrical field has been fashioned into an X-ray device. An array of these emitters can be placed around a target item to be scanned and the images from each emitter can be assembled by computer software to provide a 3-dimensional image of the target in a fraction of the time it takes using a conventional X-ray device. The system also allows rapid, precise control, enabling prospective physiological gated imaging.

Engineers at the University of Missouri (MU), Columbia, have invented a compact source of x-rays and other forms of radiation.
The radiation source is the size of a stick of gum and could be used to create portable x-ray scanners. A prototype handheld x-ray scanner using the source could be manufactured in as soon as three years.

<text>The Igbo people ( , ; also spelled Ibo and historically also &quot;Iboe&quot;, &quot;Ebo&quot;, &quot;Eboe&quot;, &quot;Eboans&quot;, &quot;Heebo&quot;;
natively ) are an ethnic group found in Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, and Equatorial Guinea. Their primary origin is found in modern day Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu, and Imo States, while others can be found in the Niger Delta and Cross-Rivers. The Igbo people are one of the largest ethnic groups in Africa.

The Igbo language is part of the Niger-Congo language family. Its regional dialects are mutually intelligible amidst the larger &quot;Igboid&quot; cluster.
The Igbo homeland straddles the lower Niger River, east and south of the Edoid and Idomoid groups, and west of the Ibibioid (Cross River) cluster.

Before the period of British colonial rule in the 20th century, the Igbo people were largely governed by the centralized chiefdoms of Nri, Aro Confederacy, Agbor and Onitsha. The Igbo people became overwhelmingly Christian during the evangelism of the missionaries in the colonial era in the twentieth century. In the wake of decolonisation, the Igbo developed a strong sense of ethnic identity. Christianity and Omenala/Odinala are the major religions, with Islamic minorities.

After ethnic tensions following the independence of Nigeria in 1960, the Igbos seceded from Nigeria and attempted to establish a new independent country called Biafra, triggering the Nigerian Civil War (1967–1970). Millions of Biafran civilians died from starvation after the Nigerian military formed a blockade around Biafra, an event that led to international media promoting humanitarian aid for Biafra. Biafra was eventually defeated by Nigeria and reintegrated into the country. The Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra and the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), two organizations formed after 1999, continue to struggle for an independent Igbo state.

== Definition and subgroups ==

&quot;Igbo&quot; as a unitary identity for all Igbo speaking people developed comparatively recently, in the context of decolonisation and the Nigerian Civil War. The various Igbo-speaking communities were historically decentralised; in the opinion of Nigerian novelist Chinua Achebe, Igbo identity should be placed somewhere between a &quot;tribe&quot; and a &quot;nation&quot;. 

== Etymology ==

Forms of the name &quot;Igbo&quot; – (formerly also spelled &quot;Heebo&quot;, &quot;Eboe&quot;, or &quot;Ibo&quot;) have been used in Western literature at least since the 18th century. The name may originate from the verb &quot;gboo&quot; (to protect, to shelter), meaning &quot;a protected people or a community of peace&quot;. Other theories give it the meaning &quot;forest dwellers&quot;, connect it to &quot;the ancients&quot; (&quot;Ndi-gbo&quot;), or suggest that it simply refers to &quot;a community of people&quot;.

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===

The Igboid languages form a cluster within the Volta–Niger phylum, most likely grouped with Yoruboid and Edoid. The greatest differentiation within the Igboid group is between the Ekpeye, and the rest. Williamson (2002) argues that based on this pattern, proto-Igboid migration would have moved down the Niger from a more northern area in the savannah and first settled close to the delta, with a secondary center of Igbo proper more to the north, in the Awka area. Genetic studies have shown the Igbo to cluster most closely with other Niger-Congo-speaking peoples. The predominant Y-chromosomal haplogroup is E1b1a1-M2.

Pottery dated from around 3,000–2,500 BC showing similarities with later Igbo work was found at Nsukka, and Afikpo regions of Igboland in the 1970s, along with pottery and tools at nearby Ibagwa; the traditions of the Umueri clan have as their source the Anambra valley. In the 1970s, the Owerri, Okigwe, Orlu, Awgu, Udi and Awka divisions were determined to constitute &quot;an Igbo heartland&quot; from the linguistic and cultural evidence. In the Nsukka region of Igboland, evidence of early iron smelting has been excavated, dating to 750 BC at the site of Opi and 2,000 BC at the site of Lejja.

=== Kingdom of Nri ===
The Nri and Aguleri people are in the territory of the Umueri clan who trace their lineages back to the patriarchal king-figure Eri. Eri&#x27;s origins are unclear, though he has been described as a &quot;sky being&quot; sent by Chukwu (God). He has been characterized as having first given societal order to the people of Anambra. The historian Elizabeth Allo Isichei says &quot;Nri and Aguleri and part of the Umueri clan, [are] a cluster of Igbo village groups which traces its origins to a sky being called Eri.&quot;

Archaeological evidence suggests that Nri influence in Igboland may go back as far as the 9th century, and royal burials at the Igbo-Ukwu sites have been unearthed dating to at least the 10th century. Eri, the god-like founder of Nri, is believed to have settled the region around 948 with other related Igbo cultures following after in the 13th century. The first Eze Nri (King of Nri) Ìfikuánim followed directly after him. According to Igbo history, his reign started in 1043. 

Each king traces his origin back to the founding ancestor, Eri. Each king is a ritual reproduction of Eri. The initiation rite of a new king shows that the ritual process of becoming Eze Nri (Nri priest-king) follows closely the path traced by the hero in establishing the Nri kingdom.
:— E. Elochukwu UzukwuThe Kingdom of Nri was a religio-polity, a sort of theocratic state that developed in the central heartland of the Igbo region. The Nri had seven types of beliefs which included human (such as the birth of twins), animal (such as killing or eating of pythons), object, temporal, behavioural, speech and place. The rules regarding these beliefs were used to educate and govern Nri&#x27;s subjects. This meant that, while certain Igbo communities may have lived under different formal administrations, all followers of the Igbo religion had to abide by the rules of the faith and obey its representative on earth, the Eze Nri.

=== Igbo-Ukwu archaeology ===

Igbo-Ukwu is a historically significant archaeological site located in southeastern Nigeria, in what is now Anambra State. The site is renowned for its remarkable discoveries of ancient artifacts that date back to the 9th and 10th centuries AD. The archaeological findings at Igbo-Ukwu have provided valuable insights into the early history and cultural achievements of the Igbo people and their interactions with other civilizations in the region. The artifacts may be associated with the traditional Kingdom of Nri and its priest-king, the Eze Nri.

The significance of Igbo-Ukwu lies in the following aspects:

Sophisticated Artifacts: The excavations at Igbo-Ukwu revealed a collection of highly sophisticated and elaborately crafted artifacts, including intricately designed bronze, copper, and iron objects. These artifacts demonstrate the advanced metallurgical skills of the ancient Igbo people and their ability to work with various metals.

The Igbo-Ukwu artifacts predate certain other well-known Nigerian bronze sculpture traditions such as those of Ife and the Benin Kingdom and have contributed to our understanding of the development of metallurgical techniques in Africa.

Cultural exchange and trade: The presence of exotic materials like glass beads and imported ceramics at the site suggests that the people of Igbo-Ukwu were engaged in trade and had connections with other cultures and civilizations, both within and outside of Africa.

Evidence of social complexity: The intricate and finely crafted artifacts found at Igbo-Ukwu suggest the existence of a sophisticated and socially complex society. The level of craftsmanship and the variety of artifacts indicate the presence of skilled artisans and a hierarchical social structure.

Influence on Igbo art and culture: The artifacts discovered at Igbo-Ukwu have had a profound impact on the understanding and appreciation of Igbo art and culture. They have inspired contemporary Igbo artists and craftsmen and contributed to a sense of cultural identity and heritage.

Recognition of African achievements: The discoveries at Igbo-Ukwu challenged the outdated notion of Africa as a continent with no significant history or cultural achievements. The site&#x27;s findings have demonstrated the richness and complexity of ancient African civilizations. The archaeological site of Igbo-Ukwu was first discovered in 1939 when a group of villagers accidentally came across the artifacts while digging a trench. Subsequent excavations conducted in the 1950s and 1970s uncovered a wealth of cultural treasures. The Igbo-Ukwu artifacts are now housed in various museums, including the Nigerian National Museum in Lagos.

Glass production: Igbo-Ukwu has one of the oldest glass productions in West Africa. The archeology of Igbo-Ukwu had over 600 prestige objects including complex cast copper-alloy sculptures and more than 165,000 glass and carnelian beads. The most common glass among the 138 analytical results for Igbo-Ukwu beads is soda-lime glass produced using plant ash.

Overall, Igbo-Ukwu remains a vital archaeological site that continues to contribute to our understanding of ancient African civilizations and their contributions to human history.

=== Aro Confederacy ===

The Aro Confederacy (1690–1902) was a political union orchestrated by the Aro people, Igbo subgroup, centered in Arochukwu in present-day southeastern Nigeria. The Aro Confederacy kingdom was founded after the beginning of the Aro-Ibibio Wars. Their influence and presence was all over Eastern Nigeria, lower Middle Belt, and parts of present-day Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea during the 18th and 19th centuries. The Arochukwu Kingdom was an economic, political, and an oracular center as it was home of the Ibini Ukpabi oracle, High Priests, the Aro King &quot;Eze Aro&quot;, and central council (Okpankpo). The Aro Confederacy was a powerful and influential political and economic alliance of various Igbo-speaking communities in southeastern Nigeria. It emerged during the 17th century and played a significant role in the region until the late 19th century. 

The Aro people, who are part of the Igbo ethnic group, inhabited the region around present-day Arochukwu in Abia State, Nigeria. They were skilled traders and missionaries who played a pivotal role in connecting various Igbo communities. This trading expertise and their military power; supported by their alliances with several related neighbouring Igbo and eastern Cross River militarized states (particularly Ohafia, Edda, Abam, Abiriba, Afikpo, Ekoi, Bahumono, Amasiri ), quickly established the Aro Confederacy as a regional economic power. The Aro Confederacy&#x27;s strength came from its well-organized network of Aro agents who were dispersed across different communities in the region. These agents acted as intermediaries in trade, diplomacy, and religious matters. They facilitated commerce, resolved disputes, and spread the worship of the Aro deity that later came to be known as the &quot;Long Juju&quot; oracle.

The &quot;Long Juju&quot; oracle was the spiritual centerpiece of the Aro Confederacy. It was housed in Arochukwu and considered a potent source of political authority and religious guidance. The Aro people used the oracle to enforce their influence and control over surrounding communities. It also served as a means to administer justice and settle disputes, often attracting pilgrims seeking solutions to their problems.
The Aro Confederacy gained significant economic power through trade and commerce. Their economy was primarily based on agriculture, with the cultivation of crops like palm oil, yams, and cassava. They were also involved in trade with neighboring communities and European merchants. They controlled trade routes that passed through their territories, collecting tolls and taxes from traders. The Aro also engaged in the Trans-Atlantic slave trade by capturing and selling slaves to European traders.

Aro activities on the coast helped the growth of city-states in the Niger Delta, and these city states became important centres for the export of palm oil and slaves. Such city-states included Opobo, Bonny, Nembe, Calabar, as well as other slave trading city-states controlled by the Ijaw, Efik, and Igbo. The Aros formed a strong trading network, colonies, and incorporated hundreds of communities that formed into powerful kingdoms. The Ajalli, Arondizuogu, Ndikelionwu, and Igbene Kingdoms were some of the most powerful Aro states in the Confederacy after Arochukwu. Some were founded and named after commanders and chiefs like Izuogu Mgbokpo and Iheme who led Aro/Abam forces to conquer Ikpa Ora and founded Arondizuogu. Later Aro commanders such as Okoro Idozuka (also of Arondizuogu) expanded the state&#x27;s borders through warfare at the start of the 19th century. Aro migrations also played a large role in the expansion of Ozizza, Afikpo, Amasiri, Izombe, and many other city-states. For example, Aro soldiers founded at least three villages in Ozizza. The Aro Confederacy&#x27;s power, however, derived mostly from its economic and religious position. With European colonists on their way at the end of the 19th century, things changed.
During the 1890s, the Royal Niger Company of Britain bore friction with the Aros because of their economic dominance. The Aro resisted British penetration in the hinterland because their economic and religious influence was being threatened. The Aro and their allies launched offensives against British allies in Igboland and Ibibioland. After failed negotiations, the British attempted to conquer the Aro Confederacy in 1899. By 1901, the tensions were especially intensified when British prepared for the Aro Expedition. The invasion of Obegu (in Igboland) was the last major Aro offensive before the start of the Anglo-Aro War. In November 1901, the British launched the Aro Expedition and after strong Aro resistance, Arochukwu was captured on 28 December 1901. By early 1902, the war was over, and the Aro Confederacy collapsed. Contrary to the belief that the Ibini Ukpabi was destroyed, the shrine still exists, and is intact in Arochukwu and serves mainly as a tourist site.

=== Aro-Ibibio Wars ===

The Aro-Ibibio Wars were a series of conflicts between the Aro people (subgroup of the Igbo) and a Ibibio in present-day Southeastern Nigeria at Ibom Kingdom from 1630 to 1902. These wars led to the foundation of the Arochukwu kingdom.

A group of proto Ibibio migrated to the area and established the Ibom Kingdom. This proto-Ibibio group originally came from Usak Edet (Isanguele), a segment of the Ejagham in present-day Southern Cameroon. The Eze Agwu from Abiriba, initiated Igbo migration into the region around the mid-17th century. The Eze Awgu group who lead the rebellion against the ruling family aligned with several outside forces like the Priest Nnachi from the Edda group near Afikpo, was called by their king Awgu Inobia (Eze Agwu) for military support. When he arrived, Nnachi and Eze Agwu allied with prince Akakpokpo Okon of the Ibibio kingdom of Ibom Kingdom. Akakpokpo Okon was the son of a marriage between an Igbo woman of Eze Agwu and the King Obong Okon Ita in an attempt of a peace treaty for a war that have been fought between the Igbo subgroup and Ibibio. The Eze Agwu/Nnachi faction decided to help Akakpokpo attempt to overthrow his brother king Akpan Okon.

The coup was heavily resisted which called for even more help. Through Nnachi, an Eastern Cross river group answered the call for help. They were known as the Akpa who were living at today Akwa Akpa before the arrival of the Efik people in that region. These warriors and traders may have had European guns which were new to the territory. Being the Igbo allies, the Akpas were led by the royal Nnubi family. Osim and Akuma Nnubi led Akpa soldiers to help fight against the ruling household. Together with Igbo forces and rebels, they fought against the Ibom Kingdom forces (1690). During the final battles, Osim Nnubi was slain in Oror city state making it the capital of Arochukwu. But at the end of the war, Osim and Akakpokpo were dead. In order to honor Osim&#x27;s legacy, his brother Akuma was crowned the first EzeAro (king). After his death, Nnachi&#x27;s descendants took the throne starting with his first son Oke Nnachi. The Arochukwu kingdom, was founded.

After Arochukwu was formed, it began to expand because of the growing population and territorial protection. Aro forces formed towns and villages which eventually grew into communities on the Arochukwu-Ibibio boundaries.

=== Igbo-Igala Wars ===
The Igbo-Igala Wars refer to a series of conflicts that took place between the Igbo people and the Igala people of Nigeria during the 18th and 19th centuries. These wars were characterized by intense military engagements, territorial disputes, and clashes over resources and political dominance. The conflicts occurred in the southeastern region of Nigeria, primarily in the areas now known as Anambra, Enugu, Ebonyi, Kogi and Delta states. These wars led to the drastic Battle of Nsukka.

Background: In the 16th century a large Igala migration occurred across the Niger River following a defeat to the Kingdom of Benin. Shortly after, a Jukun migration from Wukari conquered and established a royal dynasty in Idah, bringing them into contact with Igbo speaking groups.

Conquest of Nsukka: The Nsukka-Igala wars occurred in the 18th to 19th century following an Igala invasion and left most of Nsukka under Igala control. Nsukka is the most notable Igbo subgroup to be involved in these wars as the Igala people conquered and installed priest-kings to govern the district for almost a century. The Nsukka people have continuously inhabited northern Igboland since the 3rd millennium BCE as shown through archeological continuity and Glottochronology. They are considered to be one of the first Igbo subgroups by historian and archeologist Edwin Eme Okafor.

During the period of the Igbo-Igala Wars, marked by a scarcity of labor and insecurity resulting from slave raiding and the Nsukka-Igala conflicts, notable changes occurred in the iron smelting practices of the Nsukka people. Due to urgency, some iron smelters resorted to using wood directly in their smelting process, bypassing the usual practice of burning it to produce charcoal. This adaptation in smelting techniques demonstrates the impact of the war on the traditional methods employed by the Nsukka community, as they incorporated wood into their process to sustain their iron production amidst the challenging conditions. The conflicts started with the arrival of a figure named Onọjọ Ogboni whose background is surrounded in mystery. One of the 18th-century conflicts was the Battle of Nsukka in 1794, which resulted in a Nsukka military victory, but with significant losses including the Eze&#x27;s eldest son, and three of his wives. The battle was witnessed by Sailor, Joseph B. Hawkins.

Ebonyi conflicts: During the early 19th century, the Eastern Igbo subgroups located in Ebonyi State underwent a significant migration towards the Cross River areas, this in turn manifested in boundary disputes between several Eastern Igbo groups with her neighbors such as Ikwo-Nsobo and Osopo of Cross River State, Izzi – Osopo and Yala of Cross River State and Mgbo-Igala of Benue State. A similar migration skirmish towards Abia State in the 17th century established the Aro Confederacy. As the Ezza, Izzi, Ikwo subgroups moved northward, all who are said to descend from siblings whose patriarch hailed from Afikpo, the Ezza encountered the indigenous Orri people and protected them from extinction in exchange for farming rights. The Ikwo people encountered the Okum eventually displacing them and assimilated the rest. the Okum do not exist as an identifiable group anymore but there is archeological and cultural proof of their existence, as there are non-Igbo dances and masquerades in modern Ikwo culture. The southern Ikwo displaced the indigenous Adadama group far to modern Cross River State.

Conflict with Igala: As the Igala already lived in the area with the Orri they sought friendship with the Ezza and gave them land for farming. However, betrayed by the Ezza whose true intent was expansion and to address their ongoing land scarcity. It led to a conflict between the two groups, resulting in the Igala&#x27;s defeat and expulsion from their occupied territory which the Ezza then took control of. The Agba community, located in Ebo Ndiagu, Ochuhu Agba, and Orie Agba Elu, faced defeat as the Ezza&#x27;s territory expanded. Some rallied, but despite putting up a spirited but brief defense, the Agba were compelled to retreat southwards, leaving their abandoned lands to be later settled by Umunwagu and Ikwuate (Idembia). Seeking safety and security, the Agba people sought refuge in Ishielu Division, departing from their original mainland settlements. The Ezza met them again in 1850 and again conquered and displaced the remnants, naming the new territory Ezzagu.

Western Igbo influence: The Western Igbo people consist of the Anioma people of Delta State and the riverine side of Anambra state. While specific conflicts with the Enuani and Igala people remain poorly documented, there is one Igala-speaking community in Enuaniland known as Ebu. The Idah Kingdom conquered some significant riverine trading centers, but just as quickly as they were conquered, most came under the control of Aboh, an Ukwuani kingdom, while the others were significant trading partners to both kingdoms, supplying the entirety of palm oil Aboh traded. Although some Igala dances continue to be performed in Anioma, there is no evidence of any lasting military conquests; instead, it appears that cultural traditions were exchanged mostly through trade and interactions between the neighboring communities.

=== King Jaja of Opobo ===
King Jaja of Opobo (full name: Jubo Jubogha; 1821–1891) was the first king (amanyanabo) of Opobo. He was also the founder of Opobo city-state in present day Rivers State of Nigeria. King Jaja of Opobo is listed as an African legend, because of the hardships he overcame, and persistency to rise, even despite all the odds against him. He became a merchant, and a general, becoming one of the richest and most influential Pre-colonial Africans in history. At an indeterminate date, Jaja was kidnapped and sold into slavery, most likely by a rival Igbo warring state, or by the Aro&#x27;s. He was then brought to Ijawland thereafter. As was customary amongst the Ijaw, Jaja earned his way out of slavery after serving his master for a number of years. At the death of his master, he took charge of the trade and went on to head the Anna Pepple House merchant faction of Bonny. Under him, Anna Pepple absorbed other trade houses until a war with the Manilla Pepple House led by Oko Jumbo compelled Jaja to break away to form the Opobo city-state (26 miles east of Bonny) in 1869.

Opobo came to be a prominent trading post in the region&#x27;s palm oil trade. Jaja barred entry to European and African middlemen, effectively monopolizing trade, and by 1870 was selling eight thousand tons of palm oil directly to the British. Opobo also shipped palm oil directly to Liverpool. Despite his trade rivalry with the Europeans, Jaja sent his children to schools in Glasgow and enlisted whites to staff the secular school he built in Opobo. He barred any missionaries from entering Opobo.

At the 1884 Berlin Conference, the Europeans designated Opobo as British territory. When Jaja refused to cease taxing the British traders, Henry Hamilton Johnston, a British vice consul, invited Jaja for negotiations in 1887. Jaja was arrested on arrival aboard a British vessel; he was tried in Accra in the Gold Coast (now Ghana) then exiled, first to London, and later to Saint Vincent and Barbados in the British West Indies. His presence in the West Indies was alleged to be the cause of civil unrest, as the people of Barbados, of African descent, were upset at the poor treatment of a King from their homeland.

In 1891, Jaja was granted permission to return to Opobo, but died en route. Following his exile and death, the power of the Opobo state rapidly declined. In 1903, the King Jaja of Opobo Memorial was erected in his honor in Opobo town centre.

=== Traditional society ===
Traditional Igbo political organization was based on a democratic republican system of government. In tight knit communities, this system guaranteed its citizens equality, as opposed to a feudalist system with a king ruling over subjects. This government system was witnessed by the Portuguese who first arrived and met with the Igbo people in the 15th century. With the exception of a few notable Igbo towns such as Onitsha, which had kings called Obi and places like the Nri Kingdom and Arochukwu, which had priest kings; Igbo communities and area governments were overwhelmingly ruled by a republican consultative assembly of the common people. Communities were usually governed and administered by a council of elders. Many Igbo towns however, were also partly governed the high council known as the Ozo society, whose titles could be both earned and inherited. And the spiritual (though not political) authority of the king of Nri was recognized all over Igboland 

Although title holders were respected because of their accomplishments and capabilities, they were not revered as kings but often performed special functions given to them by such assemblies. This way of governing was different from most other communities of Western Africa and only shared by the Ewe of Ghana. &quot;Umunna&quot; are a form of patrilineage maintained by the Igbo. Law starts with the &quot;Umunna&quot; which is a male line of descent from a founding ancestor (who the line is sometimes named after) with groups of compounds containing closely related families headed by the eldest male member. The &quot;Umunna&quot; can be seen as the most important pillar of Igbo society. It was also a culture in which gender was re-constructed and performed according to social need; &quot;The flexibility of Igbo gender construction meant that gender was separate from biological sex. Daughters could become sons and consequently male.&quot;

Mathematics in indigenous Igbo society is evident in their calendar, banking system and strategic betting game called &quot;Okwe&quot;. In their indigenous calendar, a week had four days, a month consisted of seven weeks, and 13 months made a year. In the last month, an extra day was added. This calendar is still used in indigenous Igbo villages and towns to determine market days. They settled law matters via mediators, and their banking system for loans and savings, called Isusu, is also still used. The Igbo new year, starting with the month &quot;Ọ́nwạ́ M̀bụ́&quot; () occurs on the third week of February, although the traditional start of the year for many Igbo communities is around springtime in &quot;Ọ́nwạ́ Ágwụ́&quot; (June).

Used as a ceremonial script by secret societies, the Igbo have an indigenous ideographic set of symbols called Nsibidi, whose origin is now generally attributed to the neighboring Ejagham people, though in the 1900s J. K. Macgregor recorded a native tradition attributing it to the Uguakima or Uyanga section of the Igbo.

Igbo people produced bronzes from as early as the 9th century, some of which have been found at the town of Igbo Ukwu, Anambra State.

A system of indentured servitude existed among the Igbo before and after the encounter with Europeans. Indentured service in Igbo areas was described by Olaudah Equiano in his memoir. He describes the conditions of the slaves in his community of Essaka and points out the difference between the treatment of slaves under the Igbo in Essaka and those in the custody of Europeans in West Indies:

...but how different was their condition from that of the slaves in the West Indies! With us, they do no more work than other members of the community... even their master;... (except that they were not permitted to eat with those... free-born;) and there was scarce any other difference between them... Some of these slaves have... slaves under them as their own property... for their own use.

Prior to European contact, Igbo trade routes stretched as far as Mecca, Medina and Jeddah on the African continent and the Middle East.

=== Transatlantic slave trade and diaspora ===
Chambers (2002) argues that many of the slaves taken from the Bight of Biafra across the Middle Passage would have been Igbo. These slaves were usually sold to Europeans by the Aro Confederacy, who kidnapped or bought slaves from Igbo villages in the hinterland. Igbo slaves may have not been victims of slave-raiding wars or expeditions but perhaps debtors or Igbo people who committed within their communities alleged crimes. With the goal for freedom, enslaved Igbo people were known to European planters as being rebellious outspoken and having a high rate of suicide to escape slavery. There is evidence that traders sought Igbo women. Igbo women were paired with Coromantee (Akan) men to subdue the men because of the belief that the women were bound to their first-born sons&#x27; birthplace.

It is alleged that European slave traders were fairly well informed about various African ethnicities, leading to slavers targeting certain ethnic groups that were less challenging to European dominance, which plantation owners preferred. These ethnic groups consequently became fairly concentrated in certain parts of the Americas. While those that were outspoken, like the Igbo people, were dispersed to colonies such as Jamaica, Cuba, Saint-Domingue, Barbados, Colonial America, Belize and Trinidad and Tobago, among others.

Elements of Igbo culture can still be found in these places. For example, in Jamaican Patois, the Igbo word &quot;unu&quot;, meaning &quot;you&quot; plural, is still used. &quot;Red Ibo&quot; (or &quot;red eboe&quot;) describes a black person with fair or &quot;yellowish&quot; skin. This term had originated from the prevalence of these skin tones among the Igbo people, but eastern Nigerian influences may not be strictly Igbo. The word &quot;Bim&quot;, a colloquial term for Barbados, was commonly used among enslaved Barbadians (Bajans). This word is said to have derived from &quot;bém&quot; in the Igbo language meaning &#x27;my place or people&#x27;, but may have other origins (see: Barbados etymology). A section of Belize City was named &quot;Eboe Town&quot; after its Igbo inhabitants.

In the United States, the Igbo were imported to the Chesapeake Bay colonies and states of Maryland and Virginia, where they constituted the largest group of Africans. Since the late 20th century, a wave of Nigerian immigrants, mostly English and Igbo-speaking, have settled in Maryland, attracted to its strong professional job market. They were also imported to the southern borders of Georgia and South Carolina considered the low country and where Gulluh culture still preserves African traditions of its ancestors. Today, there is an area called Igbo Landing, where a group of Igbo had tried to drown themselves, rather than become slaves, when they disembarked the slave ship.

=== Colonial period ===

The establishment of British colonial rule in present-day Nigeria and increased encounters between the Igbo and other ethnicities near the Niger River led to a deepening sense of a distinct Igbo ethnic identity. The Igbo proved decisive and enthusiastic in their embrace of Christianity and Western-style education. Because of the incompatibility of the Igbo decentralized style of government and the centralized system including the appointment of warrant chiefs required for British system of indirect rule, the period colonial rule was marked with numerous conflicts and tension. During the colonial era, the diversity within each of Nigeria&#x27;s major ethnic groups slowly decreased, and distinctions between the Igbo and other large ethnic groups, such as the Hausa and the Yoruba, became sharper.

The establishment of British colonial rule transformed Igbo society, as portrayed in Chinua Achebe&#x27;s novel &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;. Colonial rule brought about changes in culture, such as the introduction of warrant chiefs as Eze (indigenous rulers) where there were no such monarchies. Christian missionaries introduced aspects of European ideology into Igbo society and culture, sometimes shunning parts of the culture. The rumours that the Igbo women were being assessed for taxation sparked off the 1929 Igbo Women&#x27;s War in Aba (also known as the 1929 Aba Riots), a massive revolt of women never encountered before in Igbo history.

Aspects of Igbo culture such as construction of houses, education and religion changed following colonialism. The tradition of building houses out of mud walls and thatched roofs ended as the people shifted to materials such as concrete blocks for houses and metal roofs. Roads for vehicles were built. Buildings such as hospitals and schools were erected in many parts of Igboland. Along with these changes, electricity and running water were installed in the early 20th century. With electricity, new technology such as radios and televisions were adopted, and have become commonplace in most Igbo households.

A series of black and white, silent films about the Igbo people made by George Basden in the 1920s and 1930s are held in the British Empire and Commonwealth Collection at Bristol Archives (Ref. 2006/070).

=== Nigerian Civil War ===
A series of ethnic clashes between Northern Muslims and the Igbo, and other ethnic groups of Eastern Nigeria Region living in Northern Nigeria took place between 1966 and 1967. Elements in the army had assassinated the Nigerian military head of state General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi on 29 July 1966, and peace negotiations failed between the military government that deposed Ironsi and the regional government of Eastern Nigeria at the Aburi Talks in Ghana in 1967. These events led to a regional council of the peoples of Eastern Nigeria deciding that the region should secede and proclaim the Republic of Biafra on 30 May 1967. General Emeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu made this declaration and became the head of state of the new republic.

The resultant war, which became known as the Nigerian Civil War or the Nigerian-Biafran War, lasted from 6 July 1967 until 15 January 1970, after which the federal government re-absorbed Biafra into Nigeria. Several million Eastern Nigerians died from the pogroms against them, such as the 1966 anti-Igbo pogrom where between 10,000 and 30,000 Igbo people were killed. Many homes, schools, and hospitals were destroyed in the conflict. The federal government of Nigeria denied Igbo people access to their savings placed in Nigerian banks and provided them with little compensation. The war also led to a great deal of discrimination against the Igbo people at the hands of other ethnic groups.

In their struggle, the people of Biafra earned the respect of figures such as Jean-Paul Sartre and John Lennon, who returned his MBE, partly in protest against British support for the Nigerian government in the Biafran War. Odumegwu-Ojukwu, stated that the three years of freedom allowed his people to become the most civilized and most technologically advanced black people in the world. In July 2007, Odumegwu-Ojukwu renewed calls for the secession of the Biafran state as a sovereign entity.

=== Recent history (1970 to present) ===
Some Igbo subgroups, such as the Ikwerre, started dissociating themselves from the larger Igbo population after the war. In the post-war era, Nigeria changed the names of places to non-Igbo-sounding words. For instance, the town of Igbo-uzo was anglicized to &quot;Ibusa&quot;. Because of discrimination, many Igbo had trouble finding employment, and during the early 1970s, the Igbo became one of the poorest ethnic groups in Nigeria.

However, since then, the Igbo people have rebuilt their cities by themselves without any support from the federal government of Nigeria. This led to the establishment of new factories, and industry in south-eastern Nigeria, making the Igbo people some of the wealthiest ethnic groups in Nigeria. Many Igbo people eventually took government positions, although many were engaged in private business. Since the early 21st century, there has been a wave of Nigerian migration to other African countries, Europe, and the Americas.

== Culture ==
Igbo culture includes various customs, practices and traditions of the Igbo people. It comprises archaic practices as well as new concepts that entered Igbo culture either through evolution or outside influences. These customs and traditions include the Igbo people&#x27;s visual art, use of language, music and dance forms, as well as their attire, cuisine and language variation. Due to the various subgroupings of Igbo society, Igbo culture is quite diverse.

=== Traditional Igbo architecture and designs ===


Traditional Igbo architecture predominantly uses locally sourced materials such as mud, clay, wood, bamboo, thatch, and palm fronds. These materials are abundant and well-suited to the local climate. The traditional Igbo dwelling is often organized within a compound, which includes several houses for extended family members arranged around a central courtyard. The courtyard serves as a communal space for gatherings and interactions. 
Igbo architecture is modular, with structures being added or expanded as family needs grow. This flexibility allows for adaptability over time. Most traditional Igbo houses feature steeply pitched thatched roofs made from palm fronds or grass. The roofs provide insulation, natural ventilation, and protection from rain. Houses may be adorned with decorative patterns and motifs, often carved into wooden beams, walls, and doors. Such designs hold cultural and symbolic significance.

Some Igbo houses have elevated floors, which serve multiple purposes, including protection against flooding, improved ventilation, and storage space underneath. Verandas and raised platforms are common features, offering shaded outdoor spaces for relaxation, socializing, and various activities.

Many Igbo houses incorporate sacred spaces, such as shrines or altars, for religious practices, ancestor veneration, and community rituals. Architectural elements often carry cultural and religious symbolism, reflecting the Igbo worldview and values. Building and maintaining structures involve collective effort, highlighting the communal nature of Igbo society. Igbo architecture takes into account the region&#x27;s climate and natural surroundings, using design elements that promote comfort and harmony with the environment. In some Igbo communities, wooden communication towers called &quot;ogene&quot; or &quot;isiokwe&quot; are erected for signaling and communication during events or gatherings. Towers were common, in Igbo architecture, often Two-storey buildings, which disproves the popular western myth that Africans didn&#x27;t have multi-story buildings prior to Colonization.
One of the unique structures of Igbo culture were the Nsude pyramids, which was a form of step pyramid built at the town of Nsude, in modern day Enugu, northern Igboland. Ten pyramidal structures were built of clay and mud. The first base section was in circumference and in height. The next stack was in circumference. Circular stacks continued, until it reached the top. The structures were temples for the god Ala/Uto, who was believed to reside at the top. A stick was placed at the top to represent the god&#x27;s residence. The structures were laid in groups of five parallel to each other. Because it was built of clay/mud, time has taken its toll requiring periodic reconstruction.
Igbo art is noted for Mbari architecture. Mbari houses of the Owerri-Igbo are large opened-sided square planned shelters. They house many life-sized, painted figures (sculpted in mud to appease the Alusi (deity) and Ala, the earth goddess, with other deities of thunder and water). Other sculptures are of officials, craftsmen, foreigners (mainly Europeans), animals, legendary creatures and ancestors. Mbari houses take years to build in what is regarded as a sacred process. When new ones are constructed, old ones are left to decay. Everyday houses were made of mud with thatched roofs and bare earth floors with carved design doors. Some houses had elaborate designs both in the interior and exterior. These designs could include Uli art designed by Igbo women.

===Language and literature===
The Igbo language was used by John Goldsmith as an example to justify deviating from the classical linear model of phonology as laid out in &quot;The Sound Pattern of English&quot;. It is written in the Roman script as well as the Nsibidi formalized ideograms, which is used by the Ekpe society and Okonko fraternity but is no longer widely used.

Nsibidi ideography existed among the Igbo before the 16th century but died out after it became popular among secret societies, who made Nsibidi a secret form of communication. Igbo language is difficult because of the huge number of dialects, its richness in prefixes and suffixes and its heavy intonation. Igbo is a tonal language, and there are hundreds of different Igbo dialects and Igboid languages, such as the Ikwerre and Ekpeye languages. In 1939, Dr. Ida C. Ward led a research expedition on Igbo dialects which could possibly be used as a basis of a standard Igbo dialect, also known as &quot;Central Igbo&quot;. This dialect included that of the Owerri and Umuahia groups, including the Ohuhu dialect. This proposed dialect was gradually accepted by missionaries, writers, publishers, and Cambridge University.

In 1789, &quot;The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano&quot; was published in London, England, written by Olaudah Equiano, a former slave. The book features 79 Igbo words. In the first and second chapter, the book illustrates various aspects of Igbo life based on Olaudah Equiano&#x27;s life in his hometown of Essaka. Although the book was one of the first books published to include Igbo material, &quot;Geschichte der Mission der evangelischen Brüder auf den caraibischen Inseln St. Thomas, St. Croix und S. Jan&quot; (), published in 1777, written by the German missionary C. G. A. Oldendorp, was the first book to publish any Igbo material.

Perhaps the most popular and renowned novel that deals with the Igbo and their traditional life was the 1959 book by Chinua Achebe, &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;. The novel concerns the influence of British colonial rule and Christian missionaries on a traditional Igbo community during an unspecified time in the late nineteenth or early 20th century. Most of the novel is set in Iguedo, one of nine villages on the lower Niger.

=== Performing arts ===
The Igbo people have a musical style into which they incorporate various percussion instruments: the udu, which is essentially designed from a clay jug; an ekwe, which is formed from a hollowed log; and the ogene, a hand bell designed from forged iron. Other instruments include opi, a wind instrument similar to the flute, igba, and ichaka. Another popular musical form among the Igbo is highlife. A widely popular musical genre in West Africa, highlife is a fusion of jazz and traditional music. The modern Igbo highlife is seen in the works of Dr Sir Warrior, Oliver De Coque, Bright Chimezie and Chief Osita Osadebe, who were among the most popular Igbo highlife musicians of the 20th century.

Masking is one of the most common art styles in Igboland and is linked strongly with Igbo traditional music. A mask can be made of wood or fabric, along with other materials including iron and vegetation. Masks have a variety of uses, mainly in social satires, religious rituals, secret society initiations (such as the Ekpe society) and public festivals, which now include Christmas time celebrations. Some of the best known include the Agbogho Mmuo () masks of the northern Igbo which represent the spirits of deceased maidens and their mothers with masks symbolizing beauty. Other impressive masks include northern Igbo Ijele masks. At high, Ijele masks consist of platforms in diameter, supporting figures made of coloured cloth and representing everyday scenes with objects such as leopards. Ijele masks are used for honoring the dead to ensure the continuity and well-being of the community and are only seen on rare occasions such as the death of a prominent figure in the community.

There are many Igbo dance styles, but perhaps, Igbo dance is best known for its atilogwu dance troops. These performances include acrobatic stunts such as high kicks and cartwheels, with each rhythm from the indigenous instruments indicating a movement to the dancer. The Egedege Dance is an Igbo traditional Royal-styled cultural dance of South Eastern Nigeria.

=== Religion and rites of passage ===
The Igbo traditional religion is known as Odinani. 
The supreme deity is called Chukwu (&quot;great spirit&quot;); Chukwu created the world and everything in it and is associated with all things in the universe. They believe the cosmos is divided into four complex parts: creation, known as Okike; supernatural forces or deities called Alusi; Mmuo, which are gods/spirits; and Uwa, the earthly world.

Chukwu is the supreme deity in Odinani and considered the creator deity, and the Igbo people believe that all things ultimately came from him, and that everything on earth, heaven and the rest of the spiritual world is under his supervision. Linguistic studies of the Igbo language suggest that the name &quot;Chukwu&quot; is a compound of the Igbo words &quot;Chi&quot; (spiritual being) and &quot;Ukwu&quot; (great in size). Each individual is born with a spiritual guide/guardian angel or guardian principle, &quot;Chi&quot;, unique to each individual and the individual&#x27;s fate and destiny is determined by their Chi. Thus, the Igbos say that the siblings may come of the same mother, but no two people have the same Chi and thus different destinies for all. Alusi, alternatively known as Arusi or Arushi (depending on dialect), are minor deities that are worshiped and served in Odinani. There are many different Alusi, each with its own purpose. When an individual deity is no longer needed, or becomes too violent, it is discarded.

The Igbo have traditionally believed in the possibility for reincarnation of individuals within the family. People are believed to be able to reincarnate into families that they were part of while alive. Before a relative dies, it is said that the soon to be deceased relative sometimes give clues of who they will reincarnate as in the family. Once a child is born, he or she is believed to give signs of who they have reincarnated from. This can be through behavior, physical traits and statements by the child. A diviner can help in detecting who the child has reincarnated from. It is considered an insult if a male is said to have reincarnated as a female.

Children are not allowed to call elders by their names without using an honorific (as this is considered disrespectful). As a sign of respect, children are required to greet elders when seeing them for the first time in the day. Children usually add the Igbo honorifics &quot;Mazi&quot; or &quot;Dede&quot; before an elder&#x27;s name when addressing them.

==== Christianity ====
Christianity was introduced to the Igbo people through European colonization in 1857. The Igbo people were hesitant to convert to Christianity initially because they believed the gods of their native religion would bring disaster to them. However, Christianity gradually gained converts in Igbo land, mainly through the work of church agents. These men built schools and focused on persuading the youth to adopt Christian values. The Igbo people today are known as the ethnic group that has adopted Christianity the most in all of Africa.
The Igbo people were unaffected by the Islamic jihad waged in Nigeria in the 19th century, but a small minority converted to Islam in the 20th century. There is also a small population of Igbo Jews, some of whom merely identifying as Jews, while others having converted to Judaism. These draw their inspiration from Olaudah Equiano, a Christian-educated freed slave who remarked in his autobiography of 1789 on &quot;the strong analogy which... appears to prevail in the manners and customs of my countrymen and those of the Jews, before they reached the Land of Promise, and particularly the patriarchs while they were yet in that pastoral state which is described in Genesis—an analogy, which alone would induce me to think that the one people had sprung from the other.&quot; Equiano&#x27;s speculation has given rise to a great debate on the origins of the Igbo.

==== Burials ====
After a death, the body of a prominent member of society is placed on a stool in a sitting posture and is clothed in the deceased&#x27;s finest garments. Animal sacrifices may be offered, and the dead person is well perfumed. Burial usually follows within 24 hours of death. In the 21st century, the head of a home is usually buried within the compound of his residence. Different types of deaths warrant different types of burials. This is determined by an individual&#x27;s age, gender and status in society. Children are buried in hiding and out of sight; their burials usually take place in the early mornings and late nights. A simple untitled man is buried in front of his house and a simple mother is buried in her place of origin: in a garden or a farm-area that belonged to her father. In the 21st century, a majority of the Igbo bury their dead in the western way, although it is not uncommon for burials to be practiced in the traditional Igbo ways.

==== Marriage ====
The process of marrying usually involves asking the young woman&#x27;s consent, introducing the woman to the man&#x27;s family and the same for the man to the woman&#x27;s family, testing the bride&#x27;s character, checking the woman&#x27;s family background, and paying the brides&#x27; wealth. Typically speaking, bride wealth is more symbolic. Nonetheless, kola nuts, wine, goats, and chickens, among other things, are listed in the proposal, as well. Negotiating the bride wealth can also take more than one day, giving both parties time for a ceremonial feast. Marriages were sometimes arranged from birth through negotiation of the two families. However, after a series of interviews conducted in the 1990s with 250 Igbo women, it was found that 94.4% of that sample population disapproved of arranged marriages.


In the past, many Igbo men practiced polygamy. The polygamous family is made up of a man and his wives and all their children. Men sometimes married multiple wives for economic reasons so as to have more people in the family, including children, to help on farms. Christian and civil marriages have changed the Igbo family since colonization. Igbo people now tend to enter monogamous courtships and create nuclear families, mainly because of Western influence. Some Western marriage customs, such as weddings in a church, take place either before or after the lgbo cultural traditional marriage.

=== Attire ===
Traditionally, the attire of the Igbo generally consisted of little clothing, as the purpose of clothing originally was simply to conceal private parts. Because of this purpose, children were often nude from birth until the beginning of their adolescence—the time they were considered to have something to hide. Uli body art was used to decorate both men and women in the form of lines forming patterns and shapes on the body.

Women traditionally carry their babies on their backs with a strip of clothing binding the two with a knot at her chest, a practice used by many ethnic groups across Africa. This method has been modernized in the form of the child carrier. Maidens usually wore a short wrapper with beads around their waist and other ornaments such as necklaces and beads. Both men and women wore wrappers. Men would wear loincloths that wrapped round their waist and between their legs to be fastened at their back, the type of clothing appropriate for the intense heat as well as jobs such as farming.

In Olaudah Equiano&#x27;s narrative, Equiano describes fragrances that were used by the Igbo in the community of Essaka:

Our principal luxury is in perfumes; one sort of these is an odoriferous wood of delicious fragrance: the other a kind of earth; a small portion of which thrown into the fire diffuses a most powerful odor. We beat this wood into powder, and mix it with palm oil; with which both men and women perfume themselves.

:— Olaudah Equiano

As colonialism became more influential, the Igbo adapted their dress customs. Clothing worn before colonialism became &quot;traditional&quot; and worn on cultural occasions. Modern Igbo traditional attire, for men, is generally made up of the Isiagu top, which resembles the Dashiki worn by other African groups. Isiagu (or &quot;ishi agu&quot;) is usually patterned with lions&#x27; heads embroidered over the clothing and can be a plain colour. It is worn with trousers and can be worn with either a ceremonial title holders hat or with the conventional striped men&#x27;s hat known as &quot;okpu&quot; a&quot;gu&quot;. For women, a puffed sleeve blouse along with two wrappers and a head tie are worn.

=== Cuisine ===

The yam is very important to the Igbo as the staple crop. It is known for its resiliency (a yam can remain fully edible for six months without refrigeration), but it can also be very versatile in terms of its incorporation into different dishes. Yams can be fried, roasted, boiled, or made into a potage with tomatoes and herbs. The cultivation of yams is most commonly carried out by men, as women tend to focus on other crops.

There are celebrations such as the New Yam festival () which are held for the harvesting of the yam. During the festival, yam is eaten throughout the communities as celebration. Yam tubers are shown off by individuals as a sign of success and wealth. Rice has replaced yam for many ceremonial occasions. Other indigenous foods include cassava, garri, maize and plantains. Soups or stews are included in a typical meal, prepared with a vegetable (such as okra, of which the word derives from the Igbo language, &quot;okwuru&quot;) to which pieces of fish, chicken, beef, or goat meat are added. Jollof rice is popular throughout West Africa, and palm wine is a popular alcoholic traditional beverage.

== Political organization ==
The 1930s saw the rise of Igbo unions in the cities of Lagos and Port Harcourt. Later, the Ibo Federal Union (renamed the Ibo State Union in 1948) emerged as an umbrella pan-ethnic organization. Headed by Nnamdi Azikiwe, it was closely associated with the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons, which he co-founded with Herbert Macaulay. The aim of the organization was the improvement and advancement (such as in education) of the Igbo and their indigenous land and included an Igbo &quot;national anthem&quot; with a plan for an Igbo bank.

In 1978, after Olusegun Obasanjo&#x27;s military regime lifted the ban on independent political activity, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo organization was formed, an elite umbrella organization which speaks on behalf of the Igbo people. Their main concerns are the marginalization of the Igbo people in Nigerian politics and the neglect of indigenous Igbo territory in social amenities and development of infrastructure. Other groups which protest the perceived marginalization of the Igbo people are the Igbo Peoples Congress. Even before the 20th century, there were numerous Igbo unions and organizations existing around the world, such as the Igbo union in Bathurst, Gambia in 1842, founded by a prominent Igbo trader and ex-soldier named Thomas Refell. Another was the union founded by the Igbo community in Freetown, Sierra Leone by 1860, of which Africanus Horton, a surgeon, scientist and soldier, was an active member.

Decades after the Nigerian-Biafran war, the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), a secessionist group, was founded in September 1999 by Ralph Uwazurike for the goal of an independent Igbo state. Since its creation, there have been several conflicts between its members and the Nigerian government, resulting in the death of members. After the 2015 Nigerian general elections a group known as the Indigenous People of Biafra became the most prominent vocal group for the agitation of the creation of an independent state of Biafra through a radio station named Radio Biafra. For the promotion of the Igbo language and culture, the Society for Promoting Igbo Language and Culture was founded in 1949 by Frederick Chidozie Ogbalu and has since created a standard dialect for Igbo.

== Demographics ==
=== Nigeria ===

The Igbo people are natively found in Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu, Imo, part of Delta, and Rivers State. The Igbo language is predominant spoken throughout the South-East, although Nigerian English is spoken as well. Prominent towns and cities in Igboland include Asaba, Aba, Abakaliki, Enugu, Nnewi, Onitsha, and Owerri among others. A significant number of Igbo people have migrated to other regions of Nigeria for trades, works and investment, such as Lagos, Abuja and Kano.

The official data on the population of ethnic groups in Nigeria continues to be controversial as a minority of these groups have claimed that the government deliberately deflates the official population of one group, to give the other numerical superiority. The CIA World Factbook puts the Igbo population of Nigeria at 15.2% of a total population of 230 million, or approximately 35 million people.

Southeastern Nigeria, which is inhabited primarily by the Igbo, is the most densely populated area in Nigeria and possibly in all of Africa. Most ethnicities that inhabit southeastern Nigeria, such as the closely related Efik and Ibibio people, are sometimes regarded as Igbo by other Nigerians and ethnographers who are not well informed about the southeast.

=== Diaspora ===
After the Nigerian Civil War, many Igbo people emigrated out of the indigenous Igbo homeland in southeastern Nigeria because of an absence of federal presence, lack of jobs, and poor infrastructure. In recent decades the Igbo region of Nigeria has suffered from frequent environmental damage mainly related to the oil industry. Igbo people have moved to both Nigerian cities such as Lagos and Abuja, and other countries such as Gabon, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. Prominent Igbo communities outside Africa include those of London in the United Kingdom and Houston, Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Seattle, Atlanta and Washington, D.C., in the United States.

About 21,000 Igbo people were recorded in Ghana in 1969, while as small number (8,680) lived on Bioko island in 2002. Small numbers live in Japan, making up the majority of the Nigerian immigrant population based in Tokyo. A large amount of the African population of Guangdong, China, is Igbo-speaking and are mainly businessmen trading between factories in China and southeastern Nigeria, particularly Enugu. Other Igbo immigrants are found in the Americas (Igbo Canadian, Igbo American and elsewhere.

<text>Clotilde Marie Pascale di Savoia, Princess of Venice (née Clotilde Marie Pascale Courau; born 3 April 1969) is a French actress. She is married to Emanuele Filiberto di Savoia, a member of the House of Savoy and the grandson of Umberto II, the last king of Italy.

==Family==

Clotilde Marie Pascale Courau
was born on 3 April 1969 in Levallois-Perret, Hauts-de-Seine, France, the eldest daughter of Jean-Claude Courau (b. 1942), an engineer, and French noblewoman Catherine Marie Antoinette du Pontavice des Renardières (b. 1948), a school teacher, daughter of Count Pierre François Marie Antoine du Pontavice des Renardières (b. 1926), whose family can be traced back to the 13th century. She has three sisters named Christine, Camille and Capucine Courau. She lived as a child, with her sisters, between Paris, Egypt and Benin. The Courau sisters were brought up in the Roman Catholic religion.

==Acting career==
In 1991, Courau was nominated for a &quot;César&quot;, for Most Promising Actress (&quot;Meilleur espoir féminin&quot;), and won a European Film Award for Best Actress, both for the film &quot;Le petit criminel&quot; (1990). She then appeared in Dusty Hughes&#x27; &quot;A Slip of the Tongue&quot; opposite John Malkovich on the stage, and in Vincent Ward&#x27;s &quot;Map of the Human Heart&quot;. In 1995, she won the &quot;Prix Suzanne Bianchetti&quot; at the SACD Awards. She was nominated again for a &quot;César&quot; twice in 1996 for Best Supporting Actress (&quot;Meilleur second rôle féminin&quot;) and Most Promising Actress (&quot;Meilleur espoir féminin&quot;) both for the film &quot;Élisa&quot;. In 1998 she was named one of European cinema&#x27;s &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; by European Film Promotion and in 2000 she won the &quot;Prix Romy Schneider&quot;. She was created a Dame of the &quot;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres&quot; of France on 7 February 2007.

==Marriage==
Clotilde Courau announced her engagement on 10 July 2003 and on 25 September married Emanuele Filiberto, Prince of Venice, at the Church of Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri in Rome. At the ceremony, she wore a wedding gown designed by Valentino. Six months pregnant at the time, she was seen as a controversial bride because of her left-wing views.

The couple have two daughters: 
* Princess Vittoria Chiara Cristina Adelaide Maria (born 28 December 2003 in Geneva, Switzerland),
* Princess Luisa Giovanna Bianca Agata Gavina Maria (born 16 August 2006 in Geneva, Switzerland).

==Rose==
In 2009, her name was given to a rose created by the rose grower Fabien Ducher to mark the 500,000th visitor to the &quot;Jardins de l&#x27;Imaginaire&quot;, Terrasson.

==Political views==
In December 2023, alongside 50 other filmmakers, Courau signed an open letter published in &quot;Libération&quot; demanding a ceasefire and an end to the killing of civilians amid the 2023 Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, as well as the establishment of a corridor into Gaza for humanitarian aid and the release of hostages.

<text>The Communist Party of Germany (, ; KPD ) was a major far-left political party in the Weimar Republic during the interwar period, an underground resistance movement in Nazi Germany, and a minor party in West Germany during the postwar period until it was banned by the Federal Constitutional Court in 1956.

Founded in the aftermath of the First World War by socialists who had opposed the war, the party joined the Spartacist uprising of January 1919, which sought to establish a soviet republic in Germany. After the defeat of the uprising, and the murder of KPD leaders Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht and Leo Jogiches, the party temporarily steered a more moderate, parliamentarian course under the leadership of Paul Levi. During the Weimar Republic period, the KPD usually polled between 10 and 15 percent of the vote and was represented in the national and in state parliaments. Under the leadership of Ernst Thälmann from 1925 the party became thoroughly Stalinist and loyal to the leadership of the Soviet Union, and from 1928 it was largely controlled and funded by the Comintern in Moscow. Under Thälmann&#x27;s leadership the party directed most of its attacks against the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), which it regarded as its main adversary and referred to as &quot;social fascists&quot;; the KPD considered all other parties in the Weimar Republic to be &quot;fascists&quot;.

The KPD was banned in the Weimar Republic one day after the Nazi Party emerged triumphant in the German elections in 1933. It maintained an underground organization in Nazi Germany, and the KPD and groups associated with it led the internal resistance to the Nazi regime, with a focus on distributing anti-Nazi literature. The KPD suffered heavy losses between 1933 and 1939, with 30,000 communists executed and 150,000 sent to Nazi concentration camps. According to historian Eric D. Weitz, 60% of German exiles in the Soviet Union had been liquidated during the Stalinist terror and a higher proportion of the KPD Politburo membership had died in the Soviet Union than in Nazi Germany. Weitz also noted that hundreds of German citizens, the majority of whom were communists, had been handed over to the Gestapo from Stalin&#x27;s administration.

The party was revived in divided postwar West and East Germany and won seats in the first (West German Parliament) elections in 1949. The KPD was banned as extremist in West Germany in 1956 by the Federal Constitutional Court. In 1969, some of its former members founded an even smaller fringe party, the German Communist Party (DKP), which remains legal, and multiple tiny splinter groups claiming to be the successor to the KPD have also subsequently been formed. In East Germany, the party was merged, by Soviet decree, with remnants of the Social Democratic Party to form the Socialist Unity Party (SED) which ruled East Germany from 1949 until 1989–1990; the merger was opposed by many Social Democrats, many of whom fled to the western zones. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, reformists took over the SED and renamed it the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS); in 2007 the PDS subsequently merged with the SPD splinter faction WASG to form .

==Party leadership==
* Paul Levi (1919–1921)
* Heinrich Brandler (1921–1925)
* Ernst Thälmann (1925–1933)
* John Schehr (1933–1934)
* Wilhelm Pieck (1934–1946)

== Early history ==

Before the First World War the Social Democratic Party (SPD) was the largest party in Germany and the world&#x27;s most successful socialist party. Although still officially claiming to be a Marxist party, by 1914 it had become in practice a reformist party. In 1914 the SPD members of the Reichstag voted in favour of the war. Left-wing members of the party, led by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, strongly opposed the war, and the SPD soon suffered a split. From the split emerged the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) and the more radical Spartacist League; the latter formed the core of what would become the KPD. In November 1918, revolution broke out across Germany. The KPD held its founding congress in Berlin from 30 December 1918 to 1 January 1919, in the reception hall of the City Council. Rosa Luxemburg was initially against the setting up of a new party but joined the KPD after her initial hesitation. Apart from the Spartacists, another dissident group of socialists called the International Communists of Germany (IKD), also dissenting members of the Social Democratic party but mainly located in Hamburg, Bremen and Northern Germany, joined the KPD. The Revolutionary Shop Stewards, a network of dissenting socialist trade unionists centered in Berlin, were also invited to the congress, but ultimately did not join the KPD because they deemed the founding congress too syndicalist-leaning.

The Party&#x27;s first Central Committee consisted of Hermann Duncker, Käte Duncker, Hugo Eberlein, Paul Frölich, Leo Jogiches, Paul Lange, Paul Levi, Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Ernst Meyer, Wilhelm Pieck, and August Thalheimer.

There were seven main reports given at the founding congress:
* &quot;Economical Struggles&quot; – by Paul Lange
* Greeting speech – by Karl Radek
* &quot;International Conferences&quot; – by Hermann Duncker
* &quot;Our Organization&quot; – by Hugo Eberlein
* &quot;Our Program&quot; – by Rosa Luxemburg
* &quot;The Crisis of the USPD&quot; – by Karl Liebknecht
* &quot;The National Assembly&quot; – by Paul Levi

These reports were given by leading figures of the Spartacist League, but members of the International Communists of Germany also took part in the discussions.

Under the leadership of Liebknecht and Luxemburg, the KPD was committed to a revolution in Germany, and attempts to bring down the interim government and create a revolutionary situation continued during 1919 and 1920. Germany&#x27;s SPD leadership, which had come to power after the fall of the monarchy, was vehemently opposed to a socialist revolution. With the new regime terrified of a Bolshevik Revolution in Germany, Defense Minister Gustav Noske recruited former right-wing military officers and demobilized veterans and formed various &quot;Freikorps&quot; and anti-communist paramilitaries to violently suppress all revolutionary activity. During the failed Spartacist uprising in Berlin of January 1919, Liebknecht and Luxemburg, who had not initiated the uprising but joined once it had begun, were captured by the &quot;Freikorps&quot; and murdered. At its peak, the party had 350–400,000 members in 1920. The party split a few months later into two factions, the KPD and the much smaller Communist Workers Party of Germany (KAPD).

Following the assassination of Leo Jogiches, Paul Levi became the KPD&#x27;s leader. Other prominent members included Clara Zetkin, Paul Frölich, Hugo Eberlein, Franz Mehring, Julian Marchlewski, August Thalheimer, Wilhelm Pieck and Ernst Meyer. Levi led the party away from the policy of immediate revolution, in an effort to win over SPD and USPD voters and trade union officials. These efforts were rewarded when a substantial section of the USPD joined the KPD, making it a mass party for the first time.

== Weimar Republic years ==

Through the 1920s, the KPD was racked by internal conflict between radical and moderate factions, partly reflecting the power struggles between Joseph Stalin and Grigory Zinoviev in Moscow. Germany was seen as being of central importance to the struggle for socialism, and the failure of the German revolution was a major setback. Eventually Levi was expelled in 1921 by the Comintern for &quot;indiscipline&quot;. Further leadership changes took place in the 1920s. Supporters of the Left or Right Opposition to the Stalinist-controlled Comintern leadership were expelled; of these, Heinrich Brandler, August Thalheimer and Paul Frölich set up a splinter Communist Party Opposition in 1928.

The leadership of the German Communist party had requested that Moscow send Leon Trotsky to Germany to direct the 1923 insurrection. However, this proposal was rejected by the Politburo which was controlled by Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev who decided to send a commission of lower-ranking Russian Communist party members.

During the years of the Weimar Republic, the KPD was the largest communist party in Europe and seen as the &quot;leading party&quot; of the communist movement outside of the Soviet Union. The party abandoned the goal of immediate revolution, and from 1924 onwards contested Reichstag elections, with some success.

=== Fischer and Thälmann leaderships and the united front ===

A new KPD leadership was elected in 1923. The party&#x27;s left around Ruth Fischer, Arkadi Maslow and Werner Scholem took leadership of the KPD in 1924; Ernst Thälmann was allied to this faction and became a member of the politburo and was appointed
KPD vice-chairman in January 1924. Stalin engineered the Fischer leadership&#x27;s removal in August 1925, and installed Thälmann as party chairman.

From 1923 to 1928, the KPD broadly followed the united front policy developed in the early 1920s of working with other working class and socialist parties to contest elections, pursue social struggles and fight the rising right-wing militias. For example, in October 1923 the KPD formed a coalition government with the SPD in the states of Saxony and Thuringia. However, the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; legally overthrew these governments by force, through a constitutional process called &quot;Reichsexekution&quot;. In 1926 the KPD worked with the SPD on a referendum to expropriate the German nobility, together mobilising 14.4 million voters.

The party&#x27;s first paramilitary wing was the &quot;Roter Frontkämpferbund&quot; (Alliance of Red Front Fighters), which was founded in 1924 but banned by the governing Social Democrats in 1929.

By 1927, the party had 130,000 members, of whom 40,000 had been members in 1920. From 1928 onwards (after Stalin reinstated Thälmann as KPD leader against the majority of the KPD central committee in the wake of an embezzlement scandal involving Thälmann&#x27;s ally John Wittorf), the party followed the Comintern line and received funding from the Comintern. Under Thälmann&#x27;s leadership, the party was closely aligned with the Soviet leadership headed by Joseph Stalin; Thälmann has been described as &quot;the driving force behind Stalinization in the mid to late 1920s&quot; and &quot;Stalin&#x27;s right hand in Germany&quot;. After winning control from his former leftist allies, he expelled the party&#x27;s Right Opposition around Heinrich Brandler.

=== The Third Period and &quot;social fascism&quot; ===

After the 1928 Reichstag election, the KPD with 54 seats remained one of the largest and most politically potent Communist parties in Europe. Led now by Thälmann, who supported a close alignment with the Soviet Union and the Communist International (Comintern). At the time, the Comintern held the position that social democracy was social fascism and that it frustrated rather than helped the proletariat. As a result, the KPD under Thälmann had a hostile, confrontational attitude toward the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) as defenders of the capitalist status quo. Their perception was reinforced by the explicit anti-Communist views of numerous SPD politicians in the German and Prussian governments, including Chancellor Hermann Müller, Interior Minister Carl Severing, Prussian Minister President Otto Braun, Prussian Interior Minister Albert Grzesinski and Berlin Police chief Karl Zörgiebel.

In the lead-up to the 1929 celebration of International Workers&#x27; Day, SPD Minister Grzesinski threatened to ban the KPD and its organizations if they acted in defiance of a ban on public gatherings in Berlin ordered by the city&#x27;s police chief Karl Zörgiebel of the SPD. The attempted banning galvanized the KPD, who responded by exhorting workers to defy the ban and organize peacefully, but to be prepared to strike on 2 May &quot;if Zörgiebel dares to spill workers&#x27; blood&quot;. The KPD proceeded with May Day marches in Berlin.

The Berlin Police responded with an immediate, harsh, and disproportionate crackdown. Often without regard to whether the persons involved were demonstrators or bystanders, they forcibly and violently dispersed the crowds that formed. As the day progressed, street battles developed between the protestors and the police, who used firearms and armoured cars. The violence lasted until the afternoon of 3 May, mostly in the working-class neighbourhoods of Wedding and Neukölln.

An estimated 33 civilians, none of whom were involved with the KPD, were killed, 200 injured, and over a thousand people taken into police custody, many of whom were also not involved in the initial KPD rallies. Only 66 of those arrested were charged and 44 convicted.

The events of Blutmai deepened the split between the SPD and KPD, the two major left-wing parties of the Weimar Republic, making a united stand against the growing strength of far-right parties more difficult.

Tensions soured, the KPD in turn began aligning with the Comintern&#x27;s ultra-left Third Period, under the slogan &quot;Class against class&quot;, the KPD turned to viewing the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) as its main adversary. The term social fascism was introduced to the German Communist Party shortly after the Hamburg Uprising of 1923 and gradually became ever more influential in the party; by 1929 it was being propagated as a theory. The KPD regarded itself as &quot;the only anti-fascist party&quot; in Germany and held that all other parties in the Weimar Republic were &quot;fascist&quot;. The Nazis achieved an electoral breakthrough in the 1930 Reichstag election.

By the early 1930s, the political situation in Weimar Germany was extremely unstable after the onset of the Great Depression. The Depression effectively destroyed the remaining legitimacy of the pro-democratic parties – such as the Social Democrats, the State Party, and the German People&#x27;s Party – in favor of the anti-democratic parties. They also followed an increasingly nationalist course, trying to appeal to nationalist-leaning workers.

In 1931, the party reported a membership of 200,000.

The KPD leadership initially first criticised but then supported the 1931 Prussian Landtag referendum, an unsuccessful attempt launched by the far-right Stahlhelm to bring down the social democrat state government of Prussia by means of a plebiscite; the KPD referred to some within the SA as &quot;working people&#x27;s comrades&quot; during this campaign.

The KPD maintained a solid electoral performance, usually polling more than 10% of the vote. It gained 100 deputies in the November 1932 elections, getting 16% of the vote and coming third. In the presidential election of the same year, its candidate Thälmann took 13.2% of the vote, compared to Hitler&#x27;s 30.1%. In this period, while also opposed to the Nazis, the KPD regarded the Nazi Party as a less sophisticated and thus less dangerous fascist party than the SPD, and KPD leader Ernst Thälmann declared that &quot;some Nazi trees must not be allowed to overshadow a forest [of social democrats]&quot;.

Critics of the KPD accused it of having pursued a sectarian policy. For example, the Social Democratic Party criticized the KPD&#x27;s thesis of &quot;social fascism&quot;, and both Leon Trotsky from the Comintern&#x27;s Left Opposition and August Thalheimer of the Right Opposition continued to argue for a united front. Critics believed that the KPD&#x27;s sectarianism scuttled any possibility of a united front with the SPD against the rising power of the National Socialists.

Thälmann claimed that the right-wing leadership of the SPD rejected and actively worked against the KPD&#x27;s efforts to form a united front against fascism. The party itself, however, continued to publicly clash with the SPD and the General German Trade Union Federation well into 1932.

A brawl between Nazi and KPD lawmakers in the Landtag of Prussia led to the creation of Antifa – short Antifaschistische Aktion, which the party itself described as a &quot;red united front under the leadership of the only anti-fascist party, the KPD&quot;. Thälmann, however, reiterated that there was still a &#x27;principal fight&#x27; to be led against the SPD and that there would be no &#x27;unity at all costs&#x27;.

After Franz von Papen&#x27;s government carried out a coup d&#x27;état in Prussia, the KPD issued a call for all workers to support a general strike under its own leadership, which only resulted in limited local action. The statement was added with a short call on the GGTUF, the SPD and the General Federation of Free Employees to join in, but the KPD&#x27;s belief that social democrats would have to be &#x27;coerced by the masses&#x27; meant that their leaders were never approached directly. The KPD tried the same tactic again after Adolf Hitler was appointed as chancellor but was widely ignored by other organisations and individual workers this time as well.

== Nazi era ==

On 27 February, soon after the appointment of Adolf Hitler as chancellor, the Reichstag was set on fire and Dutch council communist Marinus van der Lubbe was found near the building. The Nazis publicly blamed the fire on communist agitators in general, although in a German court in 1933, it was decided that van der Lubbe had acted alone, as he claimed to have done. The following day, Hitler persuaded Hindenburg to issue the Reichstag Fire Decree. It used the provisions of Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution to suspend key civil liberties, ostensibly to deal with Communist acts of violence.

Repression began within hours of the fire, when police arrested dozens of communists. Although Hitler could have formally banned the KPD, he did not do so right away. Not only was he reluctant to chance a violent uprising, but he believed the KPD could siphon off SPD votes and split the left. However, most judges held the KPD responsible for the fire, and took the line that KPD membership was in and of itself a treasonous act. At the March 1933 election, the KPD elected 81 deputies. However, it was an open secret that they would never be allowed to take up their seats; they were all arrested in short order. For all intents and purposes, the KPD was &quot;outlawed&quot; on the day the Reichstag Fire Decree was issued, and &quot;completely banned&quot; as of 6 March, the day after the election.

Shortly after the election, the Nazis pushed through the Enabling Act, which allowed the cabinet–in practice, Hitler–to enact laws without the involvement of the Reichstag, effectively giving Hitler dictatorial powers. Since the bill was effectively a constitutional amendment, a quorum of two-thirds of the entire Reichstag had to be present in order to formally call up the bill. Leaving nothing to chance, Reichstag President Hermann Göring did not count the KPD seats for purposes of obtaining the required quorum. This led historian Richard J. Evans to contend that the Enabling Act had been passed in a manner contrary to law. The Nazis did not need to count the KPD deputies for purposes of getting a super-majority of two-thirds of those deputies present and voting. However, Evans argued, not counting the KPD deputies for purposes of a quorum amounted to &quot;refusing to recognize their existence&quot;, and was thus &quot;an illegal act&quot;.

The KPD was efficiently suppressed by the Nazis. The most senior KPD leaders were Wilhelm Pieck and Walter Ulbricht, who went into exile in the Soviet Union. The KPD maintained an underground organisation in Germany throughout the Nazi period, but the loss of many core members severely weakened the Party&#x27;s infrastructure.

=== KPD leaders purged by Stalin ===

A number of senior KPD leaders in exile were caught up in Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge of 1937–1938 and executed, among them Hugo Eberlein, Heinz Neumann, Hermann Remmele, Hans Kippenberger, Fritz Schulte and Hermann Schubert, or sent to the gulag, like Margarete Buber-Neumann. Still others, like Gustav von Wangenheim and Erich Mielke (later the head of the Stasi in East Germany), denounced their fellow exiles to the NKVD.

== Post-war history ==

In East Germany, the Soviet Military Administration in Germany forced the eastern branch of the SPD to merge with the KPD (led by Pieck and Ulbricht) to form the Socialist Unity Party (SED) in April 1946. Although nominally a union of equals, the SED quickly fell under communist domination, and most of the more recalcitrant members from the SPD side of the merger were pushed out in short order. By the time of the formal formation of the East German state in 1949, the SED was a full-fledged Communist party, and developed along lines similar to other Soviet-bloc communist parties. It was the ruling party in East Germany from its formation in 1949 until 1989. The SPD managed to preserve its independence in East Berlin, forcing the SED to form a small branch in West Berlin, the Socialist Unity Party of West Berlin.

The KPD reorganised in the western part of Germany, and received 5.7 percent of the vote in the first Bundestag election in 1949. But the onset of the Cold War soon caused a collapse in the party&#x27;s support. The reputation of the party had also been damaged by the conduct of the Red Army during its occupation of eastern Germany, which included looting, political repression, and mass rape. On orders from Joseph Stalin, the Communist deputies to the Parlamentarischer Rat refused to sign West Germany&#x27;s Basic Law to avoid recognizing the political legitimacy of West Germany. At the 1953 election the KPD only won 2.2 percent of the total votes and lost all of its seats, never to return. The party was banned in August 1956 by the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany. The decision was upheld in 1957 by the European Commission of Human Rights in &quot;Communist Party of Germany v. the Federal Republic of Germany&quot;.

After the party was declared illegal, many of its members continued to function clandestinely despite increased government surveillance. Part of its membership re-founded the party in 1968 as the German Communist Party (DKP). Following German reunification many DKP members joined the new Party of Democratic Socialism, formed out of the remains of the SED. In 1968, another self-described successor to the KPD was formed, the Communist Party of Germany/Marxists–Leninists (KPD/ML), which followed Maoist and later Hoxhaist ideas. It went through multiple splits and united with a Trotskyist group in 1986 to form the Unified Socialist Party (VSP), which failed to gain any influence and dissolved in the early 1990s. However, multiple tiny splinter groups originating from the KPD/ML still exist, several of which claim the name of KPD. Another party claiming the KPD name was formed in 1990 in East Berlin by several hard line communists who had been expelled from the PDS, including Erich Honecker. The KPD (Bolshevik) split off from the East German KPD in 2005, bringing the total number of active KPDs to at least five (more or less).

The Left, formed out of a merger between the PDS and Labour and Social Justice – The Electoral Alternative in 2007, claims to be the historical successor of the KPD (by way of the PDS).

== Organization ==
In the early 1920s, the party operated under the principle of democratic centralism, whereby different tendencies could confront each other and vote on different programmes and candidates that the entire party would then follow. The leading body of the party was the Congress, meeting at least once a year. Between Congresses, leadership of the party resided in the Central Committee, which was made up of people elected at the Congress in two different ways. One group of people was elected directly by the Congress and had to live where the leadership was resident; these members formed the Zentrale. The other group was also elected at the Congress, but was nominated from the districts they represented who represented the wider party. In 1920, the Zentrale (mirroring its Russian counterpart) split itself into two bodies: a Political Bureau (Politburo) and an Organization Bureau (Orgburo). Elected figures were subject to recall by the bodies that elected them.

The KPD employed around about 200 full-timers during its early years of existence, and as Broue notes &quot;They received the pay of an average skilled worker, and had no privileges, apart from being the first to be arrested, prosecuted and sentenced, and when shooting started, to be the first to fall&quot;.

<doc id="265561" wikidata="Q77004" url="?curid=265561" title="Ernst Thälmann">
<text>Ernst Johannes Fritz Thälmann (; 16 April 1886 – 18 August 1944) was a German communist politician and leader of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) from 1925 to 1933.

A committed communist, Thälmann played a major role during the political instability of the Weimar Republic, especially in its final years, when the KPD explicitly sought to overthrow the liberal democracy of the republic. Under his leadership, the KPD became intimately associated with the government of the Soviet Union and the policies of Joseph Stalin. The KPD under Thälmann&#x27;s leadership regarded the Social Democratic Party (SPD) as its main adversary and the party adopted the position that the social democrats were &quot;social fascists&quot;.

Thälmann was leader of the paramilitary &quot;Roter Frontkämpferbund&quot;. He was arrested by the Gestapo in 1933 and held in solitary confinement for eleven years. Stalin and Vyacheslav Molotov originally sought Thälmann’s release; after the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, he abandoned efforts to that end, while Thälmann&#x27;s party rival Walter Ulbricht ignored requests to plead on his behalf. Thälmann was shot dead on Adolf Hitler&#x27;s personal order in Buchenwald in 1944.

== Early life, family, and education ==
Thälmann was born in Hamburg on 16 April 1886, His parents, Johannes &quot;Jan&quot; Thälmann (11 April 1857, Weddern (Holstein)  – 31 October 1933), a farmworker, and Mary-Magdalene (née &quot;Kohpeiss&quot;; 8 November 1857, Kirchwerder – 9 March 1927), married in 1884 in Hamburg. They had no party affiliation; in contrast to his father, his mother was deeply religious. After his birth, his parents took over a pub near the Port of Hamburg. On 4 April 1887, his sister Frieda was born (died 8 July 1967 in Hamburg). In March 1892, Thälmann&#x27;s parents were convicted and sentenced to two years in prison because they had fenced stolen goods or had taken them for debt payment.

Thälmann and his sister Frieda were placed in separate foster families. Thälmann&#x27;s parents were released early, his mother in May, and his father in October 1893. His parents&#x27; offense was used 36 years later in the campaign against him. From 1893 to 1900, Thälmann attended elementary school. He later described history, natural history, folklore, mathematics, gymnastics, and sports as his favorite subjects; he did not like religion. In the mid-1890s, his parents opened a vegetable, coal and wagon shop in Eilbek, a suburb of Hamburg. The young Thälmann worked in the business after school and did his schoolwork in the morning before classes started. Despite this burden, Thälmann was a good student who enjoyed learning. He wanted to become a teacher or to learn a trade but his parents refused to lend him financial support. He had to continue working in his parents&#x27; business, causing much sorrow and conflict with his parents. As a result, he sought a job as an unskilled worker in the port. The ten-year-old Thälmann came in contact with the port workers on strike from November 1896 till February 1897 in the bitter labor dispute known as the Hamburg Docker&#x27;s Strike 1896–1897.

== Leaving home, World War I, and desertion ==
At the beginning of 1902, Thälmann left home. He first lived in an emergency shelter, later in a basement apartment, and in 1904 he was a fireman on the steam-powered freight ship &quot;AMERIKA&quot;, which also traveled to the United States. He was a Social Democratic Party (SPD) member during 1903. On 1 February 1904, he joined the Central Union of Trade, Transport and Traffic Workers of Germany and ascended to the chairman of the Department Carters. In 1913, he supported a call of Rosa Luxemburg for a mass strike as a means of action of the SPD to enforce political demands. From 1913 to 1914, he worked for a laundry as a coachman. In January 1915, one day before he was called up for military service in World War I, Thälmann married Rosa Koch. He was posted to the artillery on the western front, where he stayed until the end of the war, taking part in the Battle of Champagne (1915–1916), the Battle of the Somme (1916), the Battle of Arras (1917), the Second Battle of the Aisne (1917), the Battle of Cambrai (1917), and the Battle of Soissons (1918). For his service, Thälmann received the Iron cross Second Class, the Hanseatic Cross and Wound Badge (twice).

Towards the end of 1917, Thälmann became a member of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD). In late October 1918, while on home leave from the front, Thälmann deserted together with four fellow soldiers. On 9 November 1918, he wrote in his diary on the Western Front that he &quot;did a bunk from the Front with 4 comrades at 2 o&#x27;clock.&quot;

== &quot;Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands&quot; (KPD) ==

After his desertion, Thälmann was active in the German Revolution of 1918–1919 in Hamburg that began on 29 October 1918. From March 1919, he was chairman of the USPD in Hamburg, a member of the Hamburg Parliament, and worked as a relief worker in the Hamburg city park before taking up a well-paying job at the employment office. There, he rose to the rank of Inspector. When the USPD split over the question whether to join the Communist International (Comintern), Thälmann sided with the pro-communist faction which merged with the KPD in November 1920, and in the following December he was elected to the KPD&#x27;s Central Committee. In March 1921, he was fired from his job at the employment office due to his political activities. That summer Thälmann was a representative of the KPD to the Congress of the Comintern in Moscow and met Vladimir Lenin personally.

In June 1922, terrorists from the ultranationalist group Organisation Consul threw a hand grenade into his ground floor flat; the assassination attempt failed and he survived. Thälmann helped to organise the Hamburg Uprising of October 1923; as this failed, Thälmann was forced to go in hiding. After Lenin&#x27;s death in late January 1924, Thälmann visited Moscow and maintained a guard of honour at his bier. From February 1924, he was deputy chairman of the KPD and from May 1924 he was also a Reichstag member. At the 5th Congress of the Comintern in July 1924, he was elected to the Comintern executive committee and a short time later to its steering committee. In February 1925, he became chairman of the KPD&#x27;s paramilitary organisation, the &quot;Roter Frontkämpferbund&quot; (RFB); this organisation was banned by the governing SPD in 1929 after the events of Blutmai (&quot;Bloody May&quot;). In September 1925, Thälmann became chairman of the KPD and thus a candidate for the German Presidency. Thälmann&#x27;s candidacy in the second round of the presidential election split the centre-left vote, ensuring that the conservative Paul von Hindenburg defeated the Centre Party&#x27;s Wilhelm Marx.

In October 1926, Thälmann supported the dockers&#x27; strike in his home town of Hamburg. He saw this as an act of solidarity with the British miners&#x27; strike which had started on 1 May, although that strike had been profitable for the Hamburg Docks as an alternative supplier of coal.

=== KPD vs. SPD ===

After the Revolution of 1918 and during the Spartacist uprising, the government ordered the suppression of the revolt and the extrajudicial murders of KPD leaders Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht by members of the Freikorps. That same year, the German Army under orders of the SPD-led republic government used military force against the Bavarian Soviet Republic. In 1920, there was a fierce suppression of the Ruhr uprising. At the 12th party congress of the KPD in June 1929 in Berlin-Wedding, Thälmann adopted a policy of confrontation with the SPD. This followed the events of &quot;Bloody May&quot;, in which 32 people were killed by the police in an attempt to suppress demonstrations, which had been banned by the Interior Minister and SPD member Carl Severing.

Thälmann&#x27;s KPD thus fought the SPD as their main political enemy, acting according to the Comintern policy, which declared social democrats to be &quot;social fascists&quot;. This made it difficult for the two leftist parties to work together against the emergence of Adolf Hitler. The KPD under Thälmann declared that &quot;fighting fascism means fighting the SPD just as much as it means fighting Hitler and the parties of Brüning.&quot; Thälmann declared in December 1931 that &quot;some Nazi trees must not be allowed to overshadow a forest&quot; of social democrats.

By 1927, Karl Kilbom, the Comintern representative to Germany, had started to combat this ultra-leftist tendency within the KPD but found Stalin machinating against his efforts. In March 1932, Thälmann was once again a candidate for the German Presidency against the incumbent Paul von Hindenburg and Hitler. The KPD&#x27;s slogan was &quot;A vote for Hindenburg is a vote for Hitler; a vote for Hitler is a vote for war&quot;. Thälmann returned as a candidate in the second round of the election, as it was permitted by the German electoral law; his vote count lessened from 4,983,000 (13.2%) in the first round to 3,707,000 (10.2%) in the second.

After the Nazis came to power in January 1933, Thälmann proposed that the SPD and KPD should organise a general strike to topple Hitler&#x27;s rule. This was rejected by the SPD, as they did not want to work with the KPD after the long years of Thälmann and the KPD&#x27;s accusations of &quot;social fascism&quot;. In February 1933, a Central Committee meeting of the then already banned KPD took place at the &quot;Sporthaus Ziegenhals&quot; in Königs Wusterhausen, near Berlin, where Thälmann had called for the violent overthrow of Hitler&#x27;s government. The Comintern&#x27;s guidelines on social democracy as &quot;social fascism&quot; remained in force until 1935, when the Comintern officially switched to endorsing a &quot;popular front&quot; of socialists, liberals, and even conservatives against the fascist threat—an attempt to win over the leftist elements of the NSDAP, especially the SA, who largely came from a working-class background and supported socialist economic policies. By that time, Hitler had risen to power to establish Nazi Germany and the KPD had been largely destroyed.

== Imprisonment and execution ==
After the Reichstag Fire on 27 February 1933, the Nazi regime targeted members of the KPD and other left-wing opponents of it in a new wave of violence and arrests. Although having gone underground yet again, Thälmann was arrested and imprisoned together with his personal secretary Werner Hirsch on the afternoon of 3 March 1933. Eight officers of Police Station 121 arrested Thälmann at his self-appointed safehouse, the home of Hans and Martha Kluczynski in Berlin-Charlottenburg. Although the main police informant was a neighbor of the Kluczynskis, Hermann Hilliges, at least four other people informed the police of the connection between the Kluczynskis and Thälmann in the days before the latter&#x27;s arrest. Thälmann had used the Kluczynskis&#x27; home occasionally for several years, but started fully residing there in January 1933. Although it was not among the six illegal residences that the military-political apparatus of the KPD had prepared for Thälmann, it was not considered known to the police.

During imprisonment, Thälmann managed to smuggle out detailed descriptions of his treatment in writing. He wrote: &quot;They ordered me to take off my pants and then two men grabbed me by the back of the neck and placed me across a footstool. A uniformed Gestapo officer with a whip of hippopotamus hide in his hand then beat my buttocks with measured strokes. Driven wild with pain I repeatedly screamed at the top of my lungs. Then they held my mouth shut for a while and hit me in the face, and with a whip across the chest and back. I then collapsed, rolled on the floor, always kept my face down and no longer replied to any of their questions.&quot;

Fellow German communist Wilhelm Pieck had managed to escape to the Soviet Union and in July 1936 issued a statement calling for the release of Thälmann. He stated: &quot;If we succeeded in raising a tremendous storm of protest throughout the world, it will be possible to break down the prison walls and as in the case of Dimitrov, deliver Thälmann from the clutches of the Fascist hangmen. The fact that Ernst Thälmann has got to spend his fiftieth birthday in the gaols of Hitler-Fascism is an urgent reminder to all the anti-Fascists of the whole world that they must intensify to the utmost their campaign for the release of Thälmann and the many thousands of imprisoned victims of the White Terror.&quot; After the German–Soviet Non-Aggression Pact in 1939 and Germany&#x27;s and the Soviet Union&#x27;s joint invasion of Poland — and despite Thälmann&#x27;s loyalty to Stalin during his time leading the KPD — Moscow pragmatically removed a slogan for the 1939 International Youth Day, which read in part, &quot;Long live Comrade Thälmann!&quot;, and replaced it with, &quot;Long live the wise foreign policy of the Soviet Union, guided by Comrade Stalin&#x27;s instructions.&quot;

Thälmann spent over eleven years in solitary confinement. In August 1944, he was transferred from Bautzen prison to Buchenwald concentration camp. That same August, Heinrich Himmler took notes during a conversation with Hitler where he said: &quot;Thälmann must be executed.&quot; A fellow Buchenwald prisoner, Marian Zgoda, recalls hearing the shooting of Thälmann on the 18th—four days after Himmler&#x27;s curt annotation in his notes. After he was shot on Hitler&#x27;s personal order, his body was immediately cremated. Shortly after, the Nazis claimed in an announcement that, together with Rudolf Breitscheid, Thälmann had died in an Allied bombing raid on 23 August.

== Legacy ==

During the Spanish Civil War, several units of German Republican volunteers (most notably the Thälmann Battalion of the International Brigades) were named in his honour. During World War II, Yugoslavia&#x27;s leader Tito organized a company of Danube Swabians and Wehrmacht defectors as the Ernst Thälmann Company to fight the German enemy.
In 1935, the former town of Ostheim in Ukraine was renamed Telmanove (Donetsk Oblast). After 1945, Thälmann and other leading communists who had been murdered, such as Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, were widely honoured in East Germany, with many schools, streets, factories, and the like named after them. Thälmann, like Luxemburg and Liebknecht, was honoured with a symbolic grave at the &quot;Memorial to the Socialists&quot; () in the Friedrichsfelde Central Cemetery, Berlin. Many of these names were changed after German reunification; streets and squares named after Thälmann remain in Berlin, Hamburg, Greifswald, and Frankfurt an der Oder. The East German pioneer organisation was named the Ernst Thälmann Pioneer Organisation in his memory. Members pledged that &quot;Ernst Thälmann is my role model ... I promise to learn to work and fight [struggle] as Ernst Thälmann teaches.&quot;
In the 1950s, a two-part East German film, &quot;Ernst Thälmann&quot;, was produced. In 1972, Cuba named a small island, Cayo Ernesto Thaelmann, after him. One of the main traffic arteries of Soviet Riga was named Ernsta Tēlmaņa iela after him on completion in 1981; however, soon after Latvia had regained independence in 1991 it was renamed Kārļa Ulmaņa gatve, after pre-World War II prime minister Kārlis Ulmanis. In Ho Chi Minh City, a highschool, THPT Ernst Thalmann (Ten-lơ-man) was named after him. The VEB Ernst Thälmann Waffenfabrik, an East German weapons factory in Suhl (formerly Simson), was named after Thälmann (until 1990). In Ulaanbaatar, a primary school&#x27;s namesake was given after Ernst Thälmann, which is still in operation. The British Communist composer and activist Cornelius Cardew named his &quot;Thälmann Variations&quot; for piano in Thälmann&#x27;s memory.

<text>Solitary confinement (also shortened to solitary) is a form of imprisonment in which an incarcerated person lives in a single cell with little or no contact with other people. It is a punitive tool used within the prison system to discipline or separate incarcerated individuals who are considered to be security risks to other incarcerated individuals or prison staff, as well as those who violate facility rules or are deemed disruptive. However, it can also be used as protective custody for incarcerated individuals whose safety is threatened by other prisoners. This is employed to separate them from the general prison population and prevent injury or death.

A robust body of research has shown that solitary confinement has profound negative psychological, physical, and neurological effects on those who experience it, often lasting well beyond one&#x27;s time in solitary. While corrections officials have stated that solitary confinement is a necessary tool for maintaining the safety and security of prisons and jails, numerous medical, mental health, and legal professional organizations have criticized the practice and hold the view that it should be sharply curtailed.

Nelson Mandela, the South African anti-apartheid activist, described solitary confinement as &quot;the most forbidding aspect of prison life.&quot; Human rights experts have stated that prolonged solitary confinement may amount to torture, and the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (known as the Mandela Rules) were revised in 2015 to prohibit placements in solitary for longer than 15 days.

== History ==

The practice of solitary confinement in the United States traces its origins to the late 18th century, when Quakers in Pennsylvania used the method as a substitution for public punishments. Research surrounding the possible psychological and physiological effects of solitary dates back to the 1830s. When the new prison discipline of separate confinement was introduced at Eastern State Penitentiary as part of the &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; or separate system in 1829, commentators attributed the high rate of mental breakdown to the system of isolating prisoners in their cells. Charles Dickens, who visited the Philadelphia Penitentiary during his travels to America, described the &quot;slow and daily tampering with the mysteries of the brain to be immeasurably worse than any torture of the body.&quot; 

The Supreme Court of the United States made its first comment about the deleterious effects of solitary confinement in 1890, noting that the use of solitary led to reduced mental and physical capabilities (&quot;In re Medley&quot; 134 U.S. 160). Records from Danish prisons between 1870 and 1920 indicate that individuals in solitary confinement there had also experienced signs of acute mental distress, including anxiety, paranoia, and hallucinations.

The use of solitary confinement increased greatly during the COVID-19 pandemic in response to the rising prevalence of the virus inside prisons and jails. Many correctional facilities were locked down for up to 23 hours a day, confining people in their cells with no programming, phone access, or human contact. In the United States alone, more than 300,000 incarcerated people were held in virus-related lockdowns during the early months of the pandemic.

== Purpose ==
===Extracting confessions===
Solitary confinement is often used to induce a confession from a prisoner in pre-trial detention. This practice has been more common in Denmark and other Scandinavian countries in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.

===Protective custody===

Solitary confinement is used on incarcerated individuals when they are considered a danger to themselves or others. It is also used on individuals who are at high risk of being harmed by others, for example because they are transgender, have served as a witness to a crime, or have been convicted of crimes such as child molestation or abuse. This latter form of isolation is known as protective custody, and can be either voluntary or involuntary. 

Though proponents of solitary have often expressed the belief that solitary confinement promotes safety in correctional facilities, there is substantial evidence that points to the contrary. In 2002, the Commission on Safety and Abuse in America, chaired by John Joseph Gibbons and Nicholas Katzenbach, found that &quot;the increasing use of high-security segregation is counter-productive, often causing violence inside facilities and contributing to recidivism after release.&quot;

Shira E. Gordon has argued that solitary confinement &quot;has not come close to solving the very problem it was meant to reduce: prison violence.&quot; In support of this view, Gordon cites a 2012 study showing that the rate of violence in California prisons is 20 percent higher than it was in 1989, when California&#x27;s first supermax prison opened. Gordon also cites the Northern District of California court in &quot;Toussaint v. McCarthy&quot;, which found that solitary confinement &quot;increase[d] rather than decrease[d] antisocial tendencies among inmates&quot; at Folsom and San Quentin State Prisons in California.
===Punishment===
Solitary confinement is also commonly used as punishment for those who have violated prison rules or committed other disciplinary infractions. The practice is the norm in super-maximum security (supermax) prisons, where individuals who are deemed dangerous or high risk are held.

===Suppressing protest===
Critics allege solitary confinement has been used to punish and suppress organizing, activism, and other political activities in prisons. In immigration detention centers, reports have surfaced that immigrant detainees are being placed in solitary to keep those knowledgeable about their rights away from other detainees. Individuals who go on hunger strike to protest poor conditions in immigration facilities are also frequently placed in solitary. Although immigration officials have claimed that their policy of isolating hunger strikers is for the protection of the detained person, medical and legal experts have pointed out that there is no medical basis behind the policy, and that, in the United States, it constitutes a violation of the detainee&#x27;s First Amendment rights.

Solitary confinement is similarly used as retaliation in prisons and jails, including against whistleblowers who raise awareness of inhumane conditions and jailhouse lawyers who assist others in litigating their rights. There have been further reports of people being placed in solitary based on their race, religion, or sexual orientation.

==By country or region==

===Europe===
While solitary confinement is less commonplace in Europe than in other parts of the world including the United States, it is still widely used in many European countries today.

The European Court of Human Rights distinguishes between complete sensory isolation, total social isolation and relative social isolation and notes that &quot;complete sensory isolation, coupled with total social isolation can destroy the personality and constitutes a form of inhuman treatment which cannot be justified by the requirements of security or any other reason. On the other hand, the prohibition of contacts with other prisoners for security, disciplinary or protective reasons does not in itself amount to inhuman treatment or punishment.&quot;

The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, or CPT, defines solitary confinement as &quot;whenever a prisoner is ordered to be held separately from other prisoners, for example, as a result of court decision, as a disciplinary sanction imposed within the prison system, as a preventive administrative measure or for the protection of the prisoner concerned.&quot; The CPT &quot;considers that solitary confinement should only be imposed in exceptional circumstances, as a last resort and for the shortest possible time.&quot;

==== Iceland ====

Iceland has faced criticism for decades over its extensive use of pre-trial solitary confinement. A 2023 report by Amnesty International documented that 61 percent of pre-trial detainees had spent time in solitary confinement in 2021; of those detained that year, 57 percent were foreign nationals, a percentage far higher than the percentage of foreign nationals in Iceland (around 14 percent of the population in 2021).

==== Italy ====
Italian prisoners subject to special surveillance (&quot;&quot;41-bis&quot; regime&quot;) may be in de facto solitary confinement. A person sentenced to multiple life sentences in Italy may be required by the Minister of Justice to serve a period of between 6 months to years in the &quot;&quot;41-bis&quot; regime&quot; of solitary confinement, subject to extension and review.

==== United Kingdom ====

In 2015, segregation (solitary confinement) was used 7,889 times. 54 out of 85,509 prisoners held in England and Wales in 2015 were placed in solitary confinement cells in Close Supervision Centres (Shalev &amp; Edgar, 2015:149), England and Wales&#x27; version of the US &#x27;Supermax&#x27;.

The use of solitary confinement on juveniles and children, as elsewhere, has been a subject of contention. Critics argue that, in the United Kingdom, the state has a duty to &quot;set the highest standards of care&quot; when it limits the liberties of children. Frances Crook is one of many to believe that incarceration and solitary confinement are the harshest forms of possible punishments and &quot;should only be taken as a last resort&quot;. Because children are still mentally developing, Crook writes, incarceration should not encourage them to commit more violent crimes.

The penal system has been cited as failing to protect juveniles in custody. In the United Kingdom, 29 children died in penal custody between 1990 and 2006: &quot;Some 41% of the children in custody were officially designated as being vulnerable&quot;. That is attributed to the fact that isolation and physical restraint are used as the first response to punish them for simple rule infractions. Moreover, Frances Crook argues that these punitive policies not only violate their basic rights but also leave the children mentally unstable and left with illnesses that are often ignored. Overall, the solitary confinement of youth is considered to be counterproductive because the &quot;restrictive environment... and intense regulation of children&quot; aggravates them, instead of addressing the issue of rehabilitation.

Solitary confinement is colloquially referred to in British English as &quot;the block&quot;, &quot;The Segregation Unit&quot; or &quot;the cooler&quot;.

=== United States ===
Solitary confinement first arose in the United States in the late 1700s among religious groups like the Quakers, who thought isolation would promote repentance and rehabilitation. Though the practice fell out of use in the early 1900s, it experienced a resurgence during the tough on crime era in the 1980s and 1990s. This period also saw the construction of supermax prisons, which typically house individuals in indefinite solitary confinement consisting of upwards of 22 hours a day of isolation.

In the United States penal system today, more than 20 percent of individuals in state and federal prisons and 18 percent of individuals in local jails are placed in solitary confinement or another form of restrictive housing at some point during their incarceration. According to a 2023 report from Solitary Watch and Unlock the Box, it is estimated that more than 122,000 people are held in solitary confinement in state and federal prisons and local jails in the United States on any given day. A report from the Liman Center at Yale Law School found that between 41,000 and 48,000 individuals were held daily in solitary confinement in state and federal prisons for 15 days or more in 2021, with over 6,000 individuals found to have been held in solitary for over a year. 

Since 2009, there have been legislative efforts in numerous states to ban the use of solitary confinement for vulnerable populations, including children, pregnant women, and LGBTQ+ people, as well as to end the use of long-term solitary confinement. In 2020, New Jersey passed the Isolated Confinement Restriction Act, which bans the use of solitary beyond 20 consecutive days. As of June 2023, New York, Connecticut, and Nevada have passed legislation banning the use of solitary beyond 15 consecutive days, bringing their use of isolation in line with the United Nations&#x27; Mandela Rules.

In July 2023, United States Representative Cori Bush (D-Mo.) introduced the End Solitary Confinement Act, which would prohibit solitary confinement except for up to a four-hour maximum in all federal prisons, jails, and immigration detention centers if passed. The bill would also incentivize similar legislation to be enacted at the state and local levels.

====Racial and other disparities====

Statistics indicate that members of marginalized groups are disproportionately likely to end up in solitary confinement. A 2019 Correctional Leaders Association/Yale Law School study found that Black women make up 21.5 percent of the United States female prison population, but 42.1 percent of the U.S. female prison population held in solitary. Another study found that 11 percent of all Black men born in Pennsylvania between 1986 and 1989 had been held in solitary by the age of 32. Disparities in the use of solitary have also been found to exist for LGBTQ+ people, Latinos, and Native Americans.

The disproportionate use of solitary on marginalized groups has been attributed to racism and other forms of discrimination which are exacerbated by the correctional environment. People of color may be more likely to be perceived as threatening and consequently receive more disciplinary tickets that land them in solitary; LGBTQ+ individuals may be placed in solitary as protective custody (either voluntarily or involuntarily) to prevent them from being assaulted or otherwise victimized. Notably, some transgender individuals have stated that they would rather risk their safety in the general prison population than being held in the isolation of protective custody.

As Angela J. Hattery and Earl Smith have written, &quot;Solitary confinement is a place where [the] racial history [of the United States] is on full display... Not only are the majority of the staff white and the majority of the prisoners Black and brown, but the very premise of solitary confinement relies on the foundation of white supremacy on which this country was built.&quot;

=== Venezuela ===

The headquarters for the Bolivarian Intelligence Service (SEBIN) in Plaza Venezuela, Caracas, have an underground detention facility that has been dubbed &quot;La Tumba&quot; (The Tomb). The facility is located at the place that the underground parking for the Metro Caracas was to be located. The cells are two by three meters that have a cement bed, white walls, security cameras, no windows, and barred doors, with cells aligned next to one another so that there is no interaction between prisoners. Such conditions have caused prisoners to become very ill, but they are denied medical treatment. Bright lights in the cells are kept on so that prisoners lose their sense of time, with the only sounds heard being from the nearby Caracas Metro trains. Those who visit the prisoners are subjected to strip searches by multiple SEBIN personnel.

Allegations of torture in La Tumba, specifically white torture, are also common, with some prisoners attempting to commit suicide. Those conditions according to the NGO Justice and Process are intended to make prisoners plead guilty to the crimes that they are accused of.

== Effects ==

=== Psychological ===
Solitary confinement has been associated with significant negative effects on mental health. Research indicates that the psychological effects of solitary confinement may encompass a range of adverse symptoms including &quot;anxiety, depression, anger, cognitive disturbances, perceptual distortions, obsessive thoughts, paranoia, and psychosis.&quot; These symptoms are so widespread among individuals held in solitary that some psychiatrists have labeled them &quot;SHU Syndrome,&quot; with SHU standing for Special Housing Unit or Security Housing Unit. In a 1983 journal article, Stuart Grassian described SHU Syndrome as a &quot;major, clinically distinguishable psychiatric syndrome.&quot; Grassian notes solitary confinement can cause extremely vivid hallucinations in multiple sensory modalities including visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory. Some other effects include dissociative features including amnesia, motor excitement with aimless violence and delusions.
For those who enter the prison system already diagnosed with a mental illness, solitary confinement can significantly worsen their condition. Incarcerated individuals with mental health conditions often &quot;decompensate in isolation, requiring crisis care or psychiatric hospitalization.&quot; The lack of human contact and sensory deprivation that characterize solitary confinement have been shown to cause permanent or semi-permanent changes to brain physiology. Alterations to brain physiology can lead individuals to commit suicide or self-harm. 

====Self-harm====
A major issue within the prison system in general, and solitary confinement in particular, is the high number of incarcerated individuals who turn to self-harm. Such self-harm can include, but is not limited to, cutting, head-banging, and swallowing foreign objects. 

A 2014 study of New York City jail admissions published in the &quot;American Journal of Public Health&quot; found that, after controlling for length of jail stay, age, race/ethnicity, and mental illness status, individuals placed in solitary confinement were 6.9 times more likely to commit self-harm and 6.3 times more likely to commit potentially fatal self-harm than the general jail population. While 7.3 percent of jail stays included any time in solitary, 53.3 percent of acts of self-harm and 45 percent of acts of potentially fatal self harm took place among people who had spent time in solitary during their stay.

Incarcerated individuals who attempt self-harm or suicide are often placed on suicide watch, an intensive form of isolation and monitoring often in a room with few if any furnishings. While on suicide watch, individuals are typically denied clothing and bedding (to prevent them from hanging themselves using bedsheets), as well as denied programming and contact visits. Though these conditions are intended to prevent individuals from committing suicide, they often exacerbate trauma and other pre-existing mental health conditions. Despite controls in place, individuals in suicide watch cells have still found ways to harm themselves.

===Physical===

Solitary confinement has been reported to cause hypertension, headaches, profuse sweating, dizziness, and heart palpitations. Many individuals in solitary experience extreme weight loss due to digestion complications and abdominal pain. They can also develop neck and back pain and muscle stiffness due to long periods of little to no physical activity. These symptoms have been linked to the intense anxiety and sensory deprivation caused by isolation, and often worsen with repeated visits to solitary.

Studies have shown that solitary confinement also has a marked effect on the human brain. fMRI scans have found that social isolation causes brain activity nearly identical to hunger cravings, and that it activates the same regions of the brain as physical pain. Furthermore, the sensory deprivation of solitary has been found to cause reduced electroencephalography (EEG) frequency on brain scans. The part of the brain that plays a major role in memory has been shown to physically shrink after long periods without human interaction. One study that placed adult rats in solitary-like conditions found that, after a month in isolation, the rats&#x27; neurons had shrunk by 20 percent. 

===Social===

Some sociologists argue that prisons create a unique social environment that do not allow individuals to create strong social ties inside or outside of the facility. The social isolation that incarcerated individuals experience is especially acute in solitary confinement, where they may be denied access to phone calls, mail, and visits from loved ones.

The psychological effects of isolation continue long after individuals are released from solitary, affecting society as a whole. Upon their reentry into society, many individuals who have spent long periods of time in solitary report having difficulty adjusting back to life outside the prison walls. They are often startled easily, and avoid crowds and public spaces. They seek out small, confined spaces because public areas overwhelm their sensory stimulation.

Anthony Graves, who spent more than 18 years in solitary confinement on the Texas death row before being exonerated in 2010, described the lasting effects of solitary in his testimony for the US Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Human Rights: 

Solitary confinement does one thing, it breaks a man&#x27;s will to live and he ends up deteriorating. He&#x27;s never the same person again… I have been free for almost two years and I still cry at night, because no one out here can relate to what I have gone through. I battle with feelings of loneliness. I&#x27;ve tried therapy but it didn&#x27;t work. The therapist was crying more than me. She couldn&#x27;t believe that our system was putting men through this sort of inhumane treatment.
According to numerous studies, any amount of time in solitary confinement can increase the risk of recidivism after release. A 2007 matched control study of Washington State prisons found that people in the study cohort who spent time in supermax prisons had a 3-year felony recidivism rate of 53 percent, which was 15 percent higher than that of their counterparts in the general prison population. The recidivism rate was even higher among people who were released directly from supermax into the community, at 69 percent.

==Legality==

The legality of solitary confinement has been frequently challenged over the past sixty years as conceptions surrounding the practice have changed. Much of the legal discussion concerning solitary confinement has centered on whether or not it constitutes torture or cruel and unusual punishment. While international law has generally begun to discourage solitary confinement&#x27;s use in penal institutions, opponents of solitary confinement have been less successful at challenging it within the United States legal system.

United Nations Special Rapporteurs on Torture Manfred Nowak and Juan Méndez have &quot;repeatedly and unequivocally stated that prolonged solitary confinement is cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and may amount to torture,&quot; though their statements are not primary sources in international law. 

A 2005 law journal article argued America&#x27;s detention system is far below the basic minimum standards for treatment of prisoners under international law and has caused an international human rights concern: &quot;U.S. solitary confinement practices contravene international treaty law, violate established international norms, and do not represent sound foreign policy.&quot;

===Torture===
Critics of solitary confinement regard the practice as a form of psychological torture with measurable physiological effects, particularly when the period of confinement is longer than a few weeks or is continued indefinitely. 

In October 2011, attorney and activist Juan E. Méndez, then the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, called on all countries to eliminate the practice except in &quot;very exceptional circumstances and for as short a time as possible,&quot; with a complete ban for juveniles and individuals with mental disabilities. &quot;Solitary confinement is a harsh measure which is contrary to rehabilitation,&quot; Méndez told the General Assembly&#x27;s Third Committee, which deals with social, humanitarian, and cultural affairs. He continued: &quot;Considering the severe mental pain or suffering solitary confinement may cause, it can amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment when used as a punishment, during pre-trial detention, indefinitely or for a prolonged period, for persons with mental disabilities or juveniles.&quot; 

The United Nations Committee Against Torture cited use of solitary confinement in the United States as excessive and a violation of the Convention Against Torture in 2014. The United Nations&#x27; &quot;Mandela Rules&quot;, which were adopted in 2015 and establish minimum standards for the treatment of prisoners, prohibit placements in solitary beyond 15 consecutive days. 

In &quot;Detention and Torture in South Africa: Psychological, Legal, and Historical Studies&quot;, psychologist Don Foster lists solitary confinement as one of the most common forms of torture used on South African detainees. &quot;Given the full context of dependency, helplessness and social isolation common to conditions of South African security law detention,&quot; Foster writes, &quot;there can be little doubt that solitary confinement under these circumstances should in itself be regarded as a form of torture.&quot;

===Ethics===

The harsh effects of solitary confinement on the individuals who experience it, particularly those diagnosed with mental illness, have led many to view the practice as cruel and unethical. 

In an article for &quot;Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law&quot;, Jeffrey Metzner and Jamie Fellner write that solitary confinement may constitute a violation of medical ethics. As the authors note, healthcare professionals are &quot;ethically obligated to refrain from countenancing, condoning, participating in, or facilitating torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment,&quot; yet human rights experts have stated that solitary confinement may amount to such treatment. &quot;It is not ethically defensible for health care professionals to acquiesce silently to conditions of confinement that inflict mental harm and violate human rights,&quot; they write.

Metzner and Fellner call on physicians not only to provide adequate medical services to individuals in isolation, but to advocate for changes to segregation policies in the facility in which they are employed and to undertake public advocacy to raise awareness of the harms of solitary in society as a whole.

==Protests==

For nearly as long as solitary confinement has existed, there have been individuals and organized movements protesting its existence. As early as 1838, Quaker prison reformer Elizabeth Fry traveled throughout England and Scotland to speak to policymakers about the dangers of solitary and to call for a reduction in its use. During the mid- to late-20th century, solitary confinement served as a site of resistance for imprisoned Black radicals. At New York&#x27;s Attica Correctional Facility, for example, Black Muslims purposely filled restrictive housing units to prevent them from being used punitively against members of the Nation of Islam.

In July 2011, individuals held in Security Housing Units (SHU) at Pelican Bay State Prison began a hunger strike to protest the &quot;torturous conditions&quot; in SHU. The participants also sought to advocate for an end to California&#x27;s policy of holding alleged gang members in indefinite solitary confinement, as well as the termination of the debriefing process, which compels people in solitary to identify either themselves or others as gang members in order to leave isolation. Over the course of the strike, more than 6,000 incarcerated individuals throughout the California prison system stood in solidarity with the Pelican Bay hunger strikers by refusing food. 
The men at Pelican Bay organized another strike in 2013, this time drawing 32,000 participants across 33 California prisons. As a result of the strike and subsequent litigation by the Center for Constitutional Rights, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation agreed to end indefinite solitary confinement for all individuals in custody. The Prisoner Hunger Strike Solidarity Coalition, a coalition of grassroots organizations and family members of strike participants, played a key role in raising public awareness for the strikers and their demands. 

In the years following the Pelican Bay strikes, incarcerated individuals across the United States have continued to organize for improved prison conditions, including an end to prolonged solitary confinement. In 2022, incarcerated workers in Alabama withheld labor to draw attention to harsh prison conditions and the need for decarceration. In 2023, dozens of incarcerated individuals in Texas went on hunger strike to protest the state&#x27;s solitary confinement policies. Prison officials in some cases have retaliated against strike participants by sending them to solitary confinement.

==Alternatives and reform==

In light of the increasing public scrutiny of solitary confinement and its documented effects, corrections leaders, policymakers, and advocates have begun to look to alternatives. The New York City Department of Correction announced in 2013 that it would start transferring individuals with severe mental illness who commit disciplinary infractions to a setting similar to a hospital ward, where they would receive medication and therapy. Those with less severe mental illness who violate facility rules are still placed in solitary, but with increased hours of therapy and a behavioral intervention program. 

Another approach that facilities have taken to reduce their reliance on solitary is to restrict the reasons for which people can be sent to solitary in the first place. In 2013, Maine replaced its policy of using solitary as a punishment for every infraction with a system of &quot;informal sanctions&quot; of reductions in privileges, which helped the state cut its then-full supermax population in half. In 2021, Washington State ended its use of disciplinary segregation entirely, stating in a press release that &quot;the agency&#x27;s data indicates that disciplinary segregation… has not been proven to be an effective sanction or deterrent to negative behavior.&quot;

A number of jurisdictions have also enacted legislation prohibiting the use of solitary for vulnerable groups or limiting it to a set number of days for the general prison population. New York&#x27;s Humane Alternatives to Long-Term (HALT) Solitary Confinement Act prohibits people from being placed in solitary for more than 15 consecutive days, or 20 days in any 60-day period. The legislation also bans placements in solitary for individuals 21 and under or 55 and older; people with physical, medical, or mental disabilities; and people who are pregnant or have recently given birth. Legislative efforts to curb the use of solitary, many of which reflect aspects of HALT, have taken place or are underway in at least 44 other states.

Finally, some corrections agencies have drawn inspiration from European countries such as Norway and Germany for reforming their use of solitary. In these countries, solitary confinement is typically used far less often and for shorter periods of time than in the United States. Norwegian prison cells are also usually more spacious and better furnished compared to their North American counterparts. However, scholars have noted that the experience of solitary confinement in Norway is not necessarily less painful, and have been critical of prison reformists for prioritizing aesthetic sensibilities over the lived experiences of incarcerated people. In 2018, the United Nations Committee against Torture criticised the &quot;high rates of prolonged isolation&quot; of prisoners in Norway, of which it stated, &quot;amounts to solitary confinement&quot;.

<text>An apartment (American English, Canadian English), flat (British English, Indian English, South African English), or unit (Australian English) is a self-contained housing unit (a type of residential real estate) that occupies part of a building, generally on a single story. There are many names for these overall buildings (see below). The housing tenure of apartments also varies considerably, from large-scale public housing, to owner occupancy within what is legally a condominium (strata title or commonhold) or leasehold, to tenants renting from a private landlord.

==Terminology==

The term &quot;apartment&quot; is favoured in North America (although in some Canadian cities, &quot;flat&quot; is used for a unit which is part of a house containing two or three units, typically one to a floor). In the UK, the term &quot;apartment&quot; is more usual in professional real estate and architectural circles where otherwise the term &quot;flat&quot; is used commonly, but not exclusively, for an apartment on a single level (hence a &quot;flat&quot; apartment).

In some countries, the word &quot;unit&quot; is a more general term referring to both apartments and rental business suites. The word &#x27;unit&#x27; is generally used only in the context of a specific building.

&quot;Mixed-use buildings&quot; combine commercial and residential uses within the same structure. Typically, mixed-use buildings consist of businesses on the lower floors (often retail in street-facing ground floor and supporting subterranean levels) and residential apartments on the upper floors.

===By housing tenure===

Tenement law refers to the feudal basis of permanent property such as land or rents. It may be found combined as in &quot;Messuage or Tenement&quot; to encompass all the land, buildings and other assets of a property.

In the United States, some apartment-dwellers own their units, either as a housing cooperative, in which the residents own shares of a corporation that owns the building or development; or in a condominium, whose residents own their apartments and share ownership of the public spaces. Most apartments are in buildings designed for the purpose, but large older houses are sometimes divided into apartments. The word &quot;apartment&quot; denotes a residential unit or section in a building. In some locations, particularly the United States, the word connotes a rental unit owned by the building owner, and is not typically used for a condominium.

In England and Wales, some flat owners own shares in the company that owns the freehold of the building as well as holding the flat under a lease. This arrangement is commonly known as a &quot;share of freehold&quot; flat. The freehold company has the right to collect annual ground rents from each of the flat owners in the building. The freeholder can also develop or sell the building, subject to the usual planning and restrictions that might apply. This situation does not happen in Scotland, where long leasehold of residential property was formerly unusual, and is now impossible.

===By size of the building===

Apartment buildings are multi-story buildings where three or more residences are contained within one structure. Such a building may be called an &quot;apartment building&quot;, &quot;apartment complex&quot;, &quot;flat complex&quot;, &quot;block of flats&quot;, &quot;tower block&quot;, &quot;high-rise&quot; or, occasionally, &quot;mansion block&quot; (in British English), especially if it consists of many apartments for rent. A high-rise apartment building is commonly referred to as a &quot;residential tower&quot;, &quot;apartment tower&quot;, or &quot;block of flats&quot; in Australia.

A high-rise building is defined by its height differently in various jurisdictions. It may be only residential, in which case it might also be called a tower block, or it might include other functions such as hotels, offices, or shops. There is no clear difference between a tower block and a skyscraper, although a building with fifty or more stories is generally considered a skyscraper. High-rise buildings became possible with the invention of the elevator (lift) and cheaper, more abundant building materials. Their structural system usually is made of reinforced concrete and steel.

A low-rise building and mid-rise buildings have fewer stories, but the limits are not always clear. Emporis defines a low-rise as &quot;an enclosed structure below 35 metres [115 feet] which is divided into regular floor levels.&quot; The city of Toronto defines a mid-rise as a building between 4 and 12 stories.

===By country===

In American English, the distinction between rental apartments and condominiums is that while rental buildings are owned by a single entity and rented out to many, condominiums are owned individually, while their owners still pay a monthly or yearly fee for building upkeep. Condominiums are often leased by their owner as rental apartments. A third alternative, the cooperative apartment building (or &quot;), acts as a corporation with all of the tenants as shareholders of the building. Tenants in cooperative buildings do not own their apartment, but instead own a proportional number of shares of the entire cooperative. As in condominiums, cooperators pay a monthly fee for building upkeep. Co-ops are common in cities such as New York, and have gained some popularity in other larger urban areas in the U.S.

In British English &amp; Canadian English the usual word is &quot;, but &#x27; is used by property developers to denote expensive &quot;flats&quot; in exclusive and expensive residential areas in, for example, parts of London such as Belgravia and Hampstead. In Scotland, it is called a block of flats or, if it is a traditional sandstone building, a &#x27;, a term which has a negative connotation elsewhere.

In India &amp; South Africa, the words &quot; and &quot; are interchangeably used to refer to a housing unit in a building. The word &quot;flat&quot; is also used to refer to multi-story dwellings that have lifts.

Australian English and New Zealand English traditionally used the term &#x27; (although it also applies to any rental property), and more recently also use the terms &#x27; or &quot;. In Australia, a &quot; refers to flats, apartments or even semi-detached houses. In Australia, the terms &quot;, &quot; and &quot; are largely used interchangeably. Newer high-rise buildings are more often marketed as &quot;, as the term &quot; carries colloquial connotations. The term condominium or condo is rarely used in Australia despite attempts by developers to market it.

In Malaysian English, &#x27; often denotes a housing block of two rooms with walk-up, no lift, without facilities, typically five stories tall, and with outdoor parking space, while &#x27; is more generic and may also include luxury condominiums.

In Japanese English loanwords (), the term &#x27; ( ) is used for lower-income housing and &#x27; ( ) is used for high-end apartments; but both terms refer to what English-speakers regard as an apartment. This use of the term &quot;mansion&quot; has a parallel with British English&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, a term denoting prestigious apartment buildings from the Victorian and Edwardian, which usually feature an ornate facade and large, high-ceilinged flats with period features. is the Japanese word for a large cluster of apartment buildings of a particular style and design, typically built as public housing by government authorities. See Housing in Japan.

==Types and characteristics==
===Studio apartment===

The smallest self-contained apartments are referred to as studio, efficiency or bachelor apartments in the US and Canada, or studio flat in the UK. These units usually consist of a large single main room which acts as the living room, dining room and bedroom combined and usually also includes kitchen facilities, with a separate bathroom. In Korea, the term &quot;one room&quot; (&quot;wonroom&quot;) refers to a studio apartment.

A bedsit is a UK variant on single room accommodation: a bed-sitting room, probably without cooking facilities, with a shared bathroom. A bedsit is not self-contained and so is not an apartment or flat as this article uses the terms; it forms part of what the UK government calls a house in multiple occupation. 

The American variant of the bedsit is the single room occupancy.

===Garden apartment (US)===
Merriam-Webster defines a garden apartment in American English as &quot;a multiple-unit low-rise dwelling having considerable lawn or garden space.&quot; The apartment buildings are often arranged around courtyards that are open at one end. Such a garden apartment shares some characteristics of a townhouse: each apartment has its own building entrance, or shares that entrance via a staircase and lobby that adjoins other units immediately above and/or below it. Unlike a townhouse, each apartment occupies only one level. Such garden apartment buildings are almost never more than three stories high, since they typically lack elevators. However, the first &quot;garden apartment&quot; buildings in New York, US, built in the early 1900s, were constructed five stories high. Some garden apartment buildings place a one-car garage under each apartment. The interior grounds are often landscaped.

In Chicago, a garden apartment refers to a basement apartment.

===Garden flat (UK)===

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines the use of &quot;garden flat&quot; in British English as &quot;a basement or ground-floor flat with a view of and access to a garden or lawn&quot;, although its citations acknowledge that the reference to a garden may be illusory. &quot;Garden flat&quot; can serve simply as a euphemism for a basement. The large Georgian or Victorian townhouse was built with an excavated subterranean space around its front known as an area, often surrounded by cast iron railings. This lowest floor housed the kitchen, the main place of work for the servants, with a &quot;tradesman&#x27;s entrance&quot; via the area stairs. This &quot;lower ground floor&quot; (another euphemism) has proven ideal for conversion to a self-contained &quot;garden flat&quot;. One American term for this arrangement is an English basement.

===Basement apartment===

Generally on the lowest (below ground) floor of a building.

===Garret apartment===

A unit in the attic of a building and usually converted from domestic servants&#x27; quarters. These apartments are characterized by their sloping walls, which can restrict the usable space; the resultant stair climb in buildings that do not have elevators and the sloping walls can make garret apartments less desirable than units on lower floors. However, because these apartments are located on the top floors of their buildings, they can offer the best views and are quieter because of the lack of upstairs neighbours.

===Secondary suite===

When part of a house is converted for the ostensible use of the owner&#x27;s family member, the self-contained dwelling may be known as an &quot;in-law apartment&quot;, &quot;annexe&quot;, or &quot;granny flat&quot;, though these (sometimes illegally) created units are often occupied by ordinary renters rather than the landlord&#x27;s relative. In Canada these are commonly located below the main house and are therefore &quot;basement suites&quot;. Another term is an &quot;accessory dwelling unit&quot;, which may be part of the main house, or a free-standing structure in its grounds.

===Salon apartment===
&quot;Salon apartment&quot; is a term linked to the exclusive apartments built as part of multi-family houses in Belgrade and in certain towns in Yugoslavia in the first decades of the 20th century. The structure of the apartments included centrally located anteroom with a combined function of the dining room and one or more salon areas. Most of these apartments were built in Belgrade (Serbia), along with the first examples of apartments popularly named &#x27;salon apartments&#x27;, with the concept of spatial and functional organization later spreading to other larger urban centers in Yugoslavia.

===Maisonette===

Maisonette (a corruption of , French for &quot;little house&quot; and originally the spelling in English as well, but it has since fallen into disuse) has no strict definition, but the &quot;OED&quot; suggests &quot;a part of a residential building which is occupied separately, usually on more than one floor and having its own outside entrance.&quot; It differs from a flat in having usually more than one floor, with a staircase internal to the dwelling leading from the entrance floor to the upper (or, in some cases, lower) other floor. It is a very common arrangement in much post-war British housing (especially but not exclusively public housing) and serves both to reduce costs by reducing the amount of space given to access corridors and to emulate the &#x27;traditional&#x27; two-storey terraced house to which many of the residents had been accustomed. It also allows for apartments, even when they are accessed by a corridor, to have windows on both sides of the building.

A maisonette could encompass Tyneside flats, pairs of single-storey flats within a two-storey terrace. Their distinctive feature is their use of two separate front doors onto the street, each door leading to a single flat. &quot;Maisonette&quot; could also stretch to cottage flats, also known as &#x27;four-in-a-block flats&#x27;, a style of housing common in Scotland.

===One dwelling with two storeys===

The vast majority of apartments are on one level, hence &quot;flat&quot;. Some, however, have two storeys joined internally by stairs, just like many houses. One term for this is &quot;maisonette&quot;, as above. Some housing in the United Kingdom, both public and private, was designed as scissor section flats. On a grander level, penthouses may have more than one storey to emphasise the idea of space and luxury. Two-storey units in new construction are sometimes referred to as &quot;townhouses&quot; in some countries (though not usually in Britain).

===Small buildings with a few one-storey dwellings===
&quot;Duplex&quot; refers to two separate units horizontally adjacent, with a common demising wall, or vertically adjacent, with a floor-ceiling assembly.

Duplex description can be different depending on the part of the US, but generally has two to four dwellings with a door for each and usually two front doors close together but separate—referred to as &#x27;duplex&#x27;, indicating the number of units, not the number of floors, as in some areas of the country they are often only one storey. Groups of more than two units have corresponding names (Triplex, etc.). Those buildings that have a third storey are known as triplexes. See Three-decker (house)

In the United States, regional forms have developed, see vernacular architecture. In Milwaukee, a Polish flat or &quot;raised cottage&quot; is a small house that has been lifted up to accommodate a basement floor housing a separate apartment, then set down again, thus becoming a modest pair of dwellings. In the Sun Belt, boxy small apartment buildings called dingbats, often with carports below, sprang up from the 1950s.

In the United Kingdom the term &quot;duplex&quot; is usually applied to an apartment with two storeys (with an internal staircase), neither of which is located at ground level. Such homes are frequently found in low-cost rental housing, in apartment blocks constructed by local authorities, or above street-level retail units, where they may be occupied by the occupier of the retail unit or rented out separately. Buildings containing two dwellings with a common vertical wall are known as &quot;semi-detached&quot;, or colloquially &quot;semis&quot;. This form of construction is very common and built as such rather than being a later conversion.

===Loft apartment===
This type of apartment developed in the USA during the middle of the 20th century. The term initially described a living space created within a former industrial building, usually 19th century. These large apartments found favor with artists and musicians wanting accommodation in large cities (New York for example) and are related to unused buildings in the decaying parts of such cities being occupied illegally by people squatting.

These loft apartments were usually located in former high-rise warehouses and factories left vacant after town planning rules and economic conditions in the mid 20th century changed. The resulting apartments created a new bohemian lifestyle and were arranged in a completely different way from most urban living spaces, often including workshops and art studio spaces. As the supply of old buildings of a suitable nature has dried up, developers have responded by constructing new buildings in the same aesthetic with varying degrees of success. 

An industrial, warehouse, or commercial space converted to an apartment is commonly called a &quot;loft&quot;, although some modern lofts are built by design.

===Penthouse===

A penthouse is an apartment usually located on the top floor of a high-rise apartment building.

===Communal apartment===

In Russia, a communal apartment («коммуналка») is a room with a shared kitchen and bath. A typical arrangement is a cluster of five or so room-apartments with a common kitchen and bathroom and separate front doors, occupying a floor in a pre-Revolutionary mansion. Traditionally a room is owned by the government and assigned to a family on a semi-permanent basis.

===Serviced apartment===

A serviced apartment is any-size space for residential living that includes regular maid and cleaning services provided by the rental agent. Serviced apartments or serviced flats developed in the early part of the 20th century and were briefly fashionable in the 1920s and 30s. They are intended to combine the best features of luxury and self-contained apartments, often being an adjunct of a hotel. Like guests semi-permanently installed in a luxury hotel, residents could enjoy the additional facilities such as house keeping, laundry, catering and other services if and when desired.

A feature of these apartment blocks was quite glamorous interiors with lavish bathrooms but no kitchen or laundry spaces in each flat. This style of living became very fashionable as many upper-class people found they could not afford as many live-in staff after the First World War and revelled in a &quot;lock-up and leave&quot; life style that serviced apartment hotels supplied. Some buildings have been subsequently renovated with standard facilities in each apartment, but serviced apartment hotel complexes continue to be constructed. Recently a number of hotels have supplemented their traditional business model with serviced apartment wings, creating privately owned areas within their buildings - either freehold or leasehold.

===Facilities===

Apartments may be available for rent furnished, with furniture, or unfurnished into which a tenant moves in with his own furniture. Serviced apartments, intended to be convenient for shorter stays, include soft furnishings and kitchen utensils, and maid service.

Laundry facilities may reside in a common area accessible to all building tenants, or each apartment may have its own facilities. Depending on when the building was built and its design, utilities such as water, heating, and electricity may be common for all of the apartments, or separate for each apartment and billed separately to each tenant. (Many areas in the US have ruled it illegal to split a water bill among all the tenants, especially if a pool is on the premises.) Outlets for connection to telephones are typically included in apartments. Telephone service is optional and is almost always billed separately from the rent payments. Cable television and similar amenities also cost extra. Parking space(s), air conditioning, and extra storage space may or may not be included with an apartment. Rental leases often limit the maximum number of residents in each apartment.

On or around the ground floor of the apartment building, a series of mailboxes are typically kept in a location accessible to the public and, thus, to the mail carrier. Every unit typically gets its own mailbox with individual keys to it. Some very large apartment buildings with a full-time staff may take mail from the carrier and provide mail-sorting service. Near the mailboxes or some other location accessible by outsiders, a buzzer (equivalent to a doorbell) may be available for each individual unit. In smaller apartment buildings such as two- or three-flats, or even four-flats, rubbish is often disposed of in trash containers similar to those used at houses. In larger buildings, rubbish is often collected in a common trash bin or dumpster. For cleanliness or minimizing noise, many lessors will place restrictions on tenants regarding smoking or keeping pets in an apartment.

===Various===

In more urban areas, apartments close to the downtown (British English town- or city-centre area have the benefits of proximity to jobs and/or public transportation. However prices per square foot/meter are often much higher than in suburban areas.

Moving up in size from studio flats are one-bedroom apartments, which contain a bedroom enclosed from the other rooms of the apartment, usually by an internal door. This is followed by two-bedroom, three-bedroom, etc. Apartments with more than three bedrooms are rare.

Small apartments often have only one entrance. Large apartments often have two entrances, perhaps a door in the front and another in the back, or from an underground or otherwise attached parking structure. Depending on the building design, the entrance doors may be connected directly to the outside or to a common area inside, such as a hallway or a lobby.

In many American cities, the one-plus-five style of mid-rise, wood-framed apartments have gained significant popularity following a 2009 revision to the International Building Code; these buildings typically feature four wood-framed floors above a concrete podium and are popular with developers due to their high density and relatively lower construction costs.

==Historical examples==

===Pre-Columbian Americas===
The Puebloan peoples of what is now the Southwestern United States have constructed large, multi-room dwellings, some comprising more than 900 rooms, since the 10th century.

In the Classic Period Mesoamerican city of Teotihuacan, apartments were not only the standard means of housing the city&#x27;s population of over 200,000 inhabitants, but show a remarkably even wealth distribution for the entire city, even by contemporary standards. Furthermore, the apartments were inhabited by the general populace as a whole, in contrast to other Pre-Modern socieites, where apartments were limited to housing the lower class members of the society, as with the somewhat contemporary Roman insulae.

===Ancient Rome===

In ancient Rome, the insulae (singular &quot;insula&quot;) were large apartment buildings where the lower and middle classes of Romans dwelled. The floor at ground level was used for tabernae, shops and businesses, with living space on the higher floors. Insulae in Rome and other imperial cities reached up to ten or more stories, some with more than 200 stairs. Several emperors, beginning with Augustus (r. 30 BC – 14 AD), attempted to establish limits of 20–25 m for multi-story buildings, but met with only limited success. The lower floors were typically occupied by either shops or wealthy families, while the upper stories were rented out to the lower classes. Surviving Oxyrhynchus Papyri indicate that seven-story buildings even existed in provincial towns, such as in 3rd century Hermopolis in Roman Egypt.

===Ancient and medieval Egypt===
During the medieval Arabic-Islamic period, the Egyptian capital of Fustat (Old Cairo) housed many high-rise residential buildings, some seven stories tall that could reportedly accommodate hundreds of people. In the 10th century, Al-Muqaddasi described them as resembling minarets, and stated that the majority of Fustat&#x27;s population lived in these multi-story apartment buildings, each one housing more than 200 people. In the 11th century, Nasir Khusraw described some of these apartment buildings rising up to fourteen stories, with roof gardens on the top story complete with ox-drawn water wheels for irrigating them.

By the 16th century, the current Cairo also had high-rise apartment buildings, in which the two lower floors were for commercial and storage purposes and the multiple stories above them were rented out to tenants.

===Yemen===

High-rise apartment buildings were built in the Yemeni city of Shibam in the 16th century. The houses of Shibam are all made out of mud bricks, but about 500 of them are tower houses, which rise 5 to 11 stories high, with each floor having one or two apartments. Shibam has been called &quot;Manhattan of the desert&quot;. Some of them were over high, thus being the tallest mudbrick apartment buildings in the world to this day.

===Ancient China===
The Hakka people in southern China adopted communal living structures designed to be easily defensible, in the form of Weilongwu (围龙屋) and Tulou (土楼). The latter are large, enclosed and fortified earth buildings, between three and five stories high and housing up to eighty families.

==Current examples==
===England===
In London, by the time of the 2011 census, 52 per cent of all homes were flats. Many of these were built as Georgian or Victorian houses and subsequently divided up. Many others were built as council flats. Many tower blocks were built after the Second World War. A number of these have been demolished and replaced with low-rise buildings or housing estates.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the concept of the flat was slow to catch on amongst the British middle classes, which generally followed the north European standard of single-family houses dating far back into history. Those who lived in flats were assumed to be lower class and somewhat itinerant, renting for example a &quot;flat above a shop&quot; as part of a lease agreement for a tradesman. In London and most of Britain, everyone who could afford to do so occupied an entire house—even if this was a small terraced house—while the working poor continued to rent rooms in often overcrowded properties, with one (or more) families per room.

During the last quarter of the 19th century, as wealth increased, ideas began to change. Both urban growth and the increase in population meant that more imaginative housing concepts would be needed if the middle and upper classes were to maintain a in the capital. The traditional London town house was becoming increasingly expensive to maintain. For bachelors and unmarried women in particular, the idea of renting a modern mansion flat became increasingly popular.

The first mansion flats in England were:
*Albert Mansions, which Philip Flower constructed and James Knowles designed. These flats were constructed between 1867 and 1870, and were one of the earliest blocks of flats to fill the vacant spaces of the newly-laid out Victoria Street at the end of the 1860s. Today, only a sliver of the building remains, next to the Victoria Palace Theatre. Albert Mansions was really 19 separate &quot;houses&quot;, each with a staircase serving one flat per floor. Its tenants included Sir Arthur Sullivan and Lord Alfred Tennyson, whose connections with the developer&#x27;s family were long-standing. Philip Flower&#x27;s son, Cyril Flower, developed most of the mansion blocks on Prince of Wales Drive, London.
*Albert Hall Mansions, designed by Richard Norman Shaw in 1876. Because this was a new type of housing, Shaw reduced risks as much as possible; each block was planned as a separate project, with the building of each part contingent on the successful occupation of every flat in the previous block. The gamble paid off and was a success.

===Scotland===
In Scotland, the term &quot;tenement&quot; lacks the pejorative connotations it carries elsewhere and refers simply to any block of flats sharing a common central staircase and lacking an elevator, particularly those constructed before 1919. Tenements were, and continue to be, inhabited by a wide range of social classes and income groups. Tenements today are bought by a wide range of social types, including young professionals, older retirees, and by absentee landlords, often for rental to students after they leave halls of residence managed by their institution. The Tenement House is a historic house museum operated by the National Trust for Scotland which offers an insight into the lifestyle of tenement dwellers as it was generations ago.

During the 19th century, tenements became the predominant type of new housing in Scotland&#x27;s industrial cities, although they were very common in the Old Town in Edinburgh from the 15th century, where they reached ten or eleven stories and in one case fourteen stories. Built of sandstone or granite, Scottish tenements are usually three to five stories in height, with two to four flats on each floor. (In contrast, industrial cities in England tended to favour &quot;back-to-back&quot; terraces of brick.) Scottish tenements are constructed in terraces, and each entrance within a block is referred to as a &quot;close&quot; or &quot;stair&quot;—both referring to the shared passageway to the individual flats. Flights of stairs and landings are generally designated common areas, and residents traditionally took turns to sweep clean the floors and, in Aberdeen in particular, took turns to make use of shared laundry facilities in the &quot;back green&quot; (garden or yard). It is now more common for cleaning of the common ways to be contracted out through a managing agent or &quot;factor&quot;.

In Glasgow, where Scotland&#x27;s highest concentration of tenement dwellings can be found, the urban renewal projects of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s brought an end to the city&#x27;s slums, which had primarily consisted of older tenements built in the early 19th century in which large extended families would live together in cramped conditions. They were replaced by high-rise blocks that, within a couple of decades, became notorious for crime and poverty. The Glasgow Corporation made many efforts to improve the situation, most successfully with the City Improvement Trust, which cleared the slums of the old town, replacing them with what they thought of as a traditional high street, which remains an imposing townscape. (The City Halls and the Cleland Testimonial were part of this scheme.) National government help was given following World War I when Housing Acts sought to provide &quot;homes fit for heroes&quot;. Garden suburb areas, based on English models, such as Knightswood, were set up. These proved too expensive, so a modern tenement, three stories high, slate roofed and built of reconstituted stone, was re-introduced and a slum clearance programme initiated to clear areas such as the Calton and the Garngad.

After World War II, more ambitious plans, known as the Bruce Plan, were made for the complete evacuation of slums for modern mid-rise housing developments on the outskirts of the city. However, the central government refused to fund the plans, preferring instead to depopulate the city to a series of New Towns. Again, economic considerations meant that many of the planned &quot;New Town&quot; amenities were never built in these areas. These housing estates, known as &quot;schemes&quot;, came therefore to be widely regarded as unsuccessful; many, such as Castlemilk, were just dormitories well away from the centre of the city with no amenities, such as shops and public houses (&quot;deserts with windows&quot;, as Billy Connolly once put it). High-rise living too started off with bright ambition—the Moss Heights, built in the 1950s, are still desirable—but fell prey to later economic pressure. Many of the later tower blocks were poorly designed and cheaply built and their anonymity caused some social problems. The demolition of the tower blocks in order to build modern housing schemes has in some cases led to a re-interpretations of the tenement.

In 1970, a team from Strathclyde University demonstrated that the old tenements had been basically sound, and could be given new life with replumbing providing modern kitchens and bathrooms. The Corporation acted on this principle for the first time in 1973 at the &quot;Old Swan Corner&quot;, Pollokshaws. Thereafter, &quot;Housing Action Areas&quot; were set up to renovate so-called slums. Later, privately owned tenements benefited from government help in &quot;stone cleaning&quot;, revealing a honey-coloured sandstone behind the presumed &quot;grey&quot; tenemental facades. The policy of tenement demolition is now considered to have been short-sighted, wasteful and largely unsuccessful. Many of Glasgow&#x27;s worst tenements were refurbished into desirable accommodation in the 1970s and 1980s and the policy of demolition is considered to have destroyed fine examples of a &quot;universally admired architectural&quot; style. The Glasgow Housing Association took ownership of the public housing stock from the city council on 7 March 2003, and has begun a £96 million clearance and demolition programme to clear and demolish many of the high-rise flats.

===United States===


In 1839, the first New York City tenement was built, and soon became breeding grounds for outlaws, juvenile delinquents, and organized crime. Tenements, or their slum landlords, were also known for their price gouging rent. &quot;How the Other Half Lives&quot; notes one tenement district:

Blind Man&#x27;s Alley bear its name for a reason. Until little more than a year ago its dark burrows harbored a colony of blind beggars, tenants of a blind landlord, old Daniel Murphy, whom every child in the ward knows, if he never heard of the President of the United States. &quot;Old Dan&quot; made a big fortune—he told me once four hundred thousand dollars—out of his alley and the surrounding tenements, only to grow blind himself in extreme old age, sharing in the end the chief hardship of the wretched beings whose lot he had stubbornly refused to better that he might increase his wealth. Even when the Board of Health at last compelled him to repair and clean up the worst of the old buildings, under threat of driving out the tenants and locking the doors behind them, the work was accomplished against the old man&#x27;s angry protests. He appeared in person before the Board to argue his case, and his argument was characteristic. &quot;I have made my will,&quot; he said. &quot;My monument stands waiting for me in Calvary. I stand on the very brink of the grave, blind and helpless, and now (here the pathos of the appeal was swept under in a burst of angry indignation) do you want me to build and get skinned, skinned? These people are not fit to live in a nice house. Let them go where they can, and let my house stand.&quot; In spite of the genuine anguish of the appeal, it was downright amusing to find that his anger was provoked less by the anticipated waste of luxury on his tenants than by distrust of his own kind, the builder. He knew intuitively what to expect. The result showed that Mr. Murphy had gauged his tenants correctly.

Many campaigners, such as Upton Sinclair and Jacob Riis, pushed for reforms in tenement dwellings. As a result, the New York State Tenement House Act was passed in 1901 to improve the conditions. More improvements followed. In 1949, President Harry S. Truman signed the Housing Act of 1949 to clean slums and reconstruct housing units for the poor.

The Dakota (1884) was one of the first luxury apartment buildings in New York City. The majority, however, remained tenements.

Some significant developments in architectural design of apartment buildings came out of the 1950s and 1960s. Among them were groundbreaking designs in Chicago: the 860-880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments (1951), Marina City (1964) and Lake Point Tower (1968).

In the United States, &quot;tenement&quot; is a label usually applied to the less expensive, more basic rental apartment buildings in older sections of large cities. Many of these apartment buildings are &quot;walk-ups&quot; without an elevator, and some have shared bathing facilities, though this is becoming less common. The slang term &quot;dingbat&quot; is used to describe cheap urban apartment buildings from the 1950s and 1960s with unique and often wacky façades to differentiate themselves within a full block of apartments. They are often built on stilts, and with parking underneath.

===Canada===

Apartments were popular in Canada, particularly in urban centres like Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, and Hamilton in the 1950s to 1970s. By the 1980s, many multi-unit buildings were being constructed as condominiums instead of apartments—both are now very common. In Toronto and Vancouver, high-rise apartments and condominiums have been spread around the city, giving even the major suburbs a skyline. The robustness of the condo markets in Toronto and Vancouver are based on the lack of land availability. The average capitalization rate in the Greater Toronto Area for Q3 2015 hit its lowest level in 30 years: in Q3 2015 it stood at 3.75 per cent, down from 4.2 per cent in Q2 2015 and down almost 50 per cent from the 6.3 per cent posted in Q3 2010.

===Australia===
Apartment buildings in Australia are typically managed by a body corporate in which owners pay a monthly fee to provide for maintenance of common premises. Many apartments are owned through strata title. Australian legislation enforces a minimum 2.4m floor-ceiling height which differentiates apartment buildings from office buildings.

Australia has a relatively recent history in apartment buildings. Terrace houses were the early response to density development, though the majority of Australians lived in fully detached houses. Apartments of any kind were legislated against in the Parliament of Queensland as part of the Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act 1885.

The earliest apartment buildings were in the major cities of Sydney and Melbourne as the response to fast rising land values–both cities are home to the two oldest surviving apartment buildings in the country, Kingsclere in Potts Point, and The Canterbury Flats in St Kilda. Melbourne Mansions on Collins Street, Melbourne (now demolished), built in 1906 for mostly wealthy residents is believed by many to be the earliest. Today the oldest surviving self-contained apartment buildings are in the St Kilda area including the Fawkner Mansions (1910), Majestic Mansions (1912 as a boarding house) and the Canterbury (1914—the oldest surviving buildings contained flats). Kingsclere, built in 1912 is believed to be the earliest apartment building in Sydney and still survives.

During the interwar years, apartment building continued in inner Melbourne (particularly in areas such as St Kilda and South Yarra), Sydney (particularly in areas such as Potts Point, Darlinghust and Kings Cross) and in Brisbane (in areas such as New Farm, Fortitude Valley and Spring Hill).

Post–World War II, with the Australian Dream apartment buildings went out of vogue and flats were seen as accommodation only for the poor. Walk-up flats (without a lift) of two to three stories however were common in the middle suburbs of cities for lower income groups. The main exceptions were Sydney and the Gold Coast, Queensland where apartment development continued for more than half a century. In Sydney a limited geography and highly sought after waterfront views (Sydney Harbour and beaches such as Bondi) made apartment living socially acceptable. Since the 1960s, these cities maintained much higher population densities than the rest of Australia through the acceptance of apartment buildings.

In other cities, apartment building was almost solely restricted to public housing. Public housing in Australia was common in the larger cities, particularly in Melbourne (by the Housing Commission of Victoria) where a number of high-rise housing commission flats were built between the 1950s and 1970s by successive governments as part of an urban renewal program. Areas affected included Fitzroy, Flemington, Collingwood, Carlton, Richmond and Prahran. Similar projects were run in Sydney&#x27;s lower socio-economic areas like Redfern.

In the 1980s, modern apartment buildings sprang up in riverside locations in Brisbane (along the Brisbane River) and Perth (along the Swan River).

In Melbourne, in the 1990s, a trend began for apartment buildings without the requirement of spectacular views. As a continuation of the gentrification of the inner city, a fashion became New York &quot;loft&quot; style apartments (see above) and a large stock of old warehouses and old abandoned office buildings in and around the central business district became the target of developers. The trend of adaptive reuse extended to conversion of old churches and schools. Similar warehouse conversions and gentrification began in Brisbane suburbs such as Teneriffe, Queensland and Fortitude Valley and in Sydney in areas such as Ultimo. As the supply of buildings for conversion ran out, reproduction and modern high-rise apartments followed. This was particularly the case in Melbourne thanks to official planning policies (Postcode 3000), making the CBD the fastest growing, population wise in the country. Apartment building in the Melbourne metropolitan area has also escalated with the advent of the Melbourne 2030 planning policy. Urban renewal areas like Docklands, Southbank, St Kilda Road and Port Melbourne are now predominantly apartments. There has also been a sharp increase in the number of student apartment buildings in areas such as Carlton in Melbourne.

Despite their size, other smaller cities including Canberra, Darwin, Townsville, Cairns, Newcastle, Wollongong, Adelaide and Geelong have begun building apartments in the 2000s.

Today, residential buildings such as the Eureka Tower and Q1 are among the tallest in the country.

=== South Korea ===

As of 2019, a majority of Koreans live in apartments. Since the 1980s, the number of apartment residents has soared, and as the number of apartments has steadily increased, apartments have become a representative form of residence where more than half of the Korean population resides.

It is the most common house in small and medium-sized cities in Korea, and even these days, apartments are quite visible in rural areas such as remote areas. This is because small and medium-sized construction companies have technology, but they lack the capital to build large complexes in large cities. The better the location, the more expensive the apartment is, and the more expensive the apartment complex built by a large construction company and with a large number of households. Also, even the same type of flat in the same complex is not all of the same price. Due to problems such as the right to sunlight and prospects, the low-rise households on the first and third floors are generally the cheapest, and the higher they go, the more expensive they become. In addition, the price varies depending on other conditions such as the viewing area and the direction of the house, such as south, east, west, and north. The upper floors with a south-facing view are the most expensive. Apartment sales and lease prices are actually the largest and most stable assets owned by a middle-class family in Korea, symbolizing the social status of a family, which forms a class and determines life satisfaction. For this reason, the Korean people have no choice but to react very sensitively to apartment prices.

<text>In anthropology, kinship is the web of social relationships that form an important part of the lives of all humans in all societies, although its exact meanings even within this discipline are often debated. Anthropologist Robin Fox says that the study of kinship is the study of what humans do with these basic facts of lifemating, gestation, parenthood, socialization, siblingship etc. Human society is unique, he argues, in that we are &quot;working with the same raw material as exists in the animal world, but [we] can conceptualize and categorize it to serve social ends.&quot; These social ends include the socialization of children and the formation of basic economic, political and religious groups.

Kinship can refer both to the patterns of social relationships themselves, or it can refer to the study of the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures (i.e. kinship studies). Over its history, anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms in the study of kinship, such as descent, descent group, lineage, affinity/affine, consanguinity/cognate and fictive kinship. Further, even within these two broad usages of the term, there are different theoretical approaches.

Broadly, kinship patterns may be considered to include people related by both descent – i.e. social relations during development – and by marriage. Human kinship relations through marriage are commonly called &quot;affinity&quot; in contrast to the relationships that arise in one&#x27;s group of origin, which may be called one&#x27;s descent group. In some cultures, kinship relationships may be considered to extend out to people an individual has economic or political relationships with, or other forms of social connections. Within a culture, some descent groups may be considered to lead back to gods or animal ancestors (totems). This may be conceived of on a more or less literal basis.

Kinship can also refer to a principle by which individuals or groups of individuals are organized into social groups, roles, categories and genealogy by means of kinship terminologies. Family relations can be represented concretely (mother, brother, grandfather) or abstractly by degrees of relationship (kinship distance). A relationship may be relative (e.g. a father in relation to a child) or reflect an absolute (e.g. the difference between a mother and a childless woman). Degrees of relationship are not identical to heirship or legal succession. Many codes of ethics consider the bond of kinship as creating obligations between the related persons stronger than those between strangers, as in Confucian filial piety.

In a more general sense, kinship may refer to a similarity or between entities on the basis of some or all of their characteristics that are under focus. This may be due to a shared ontological origin, a shared historical or cultural connection, or some other perceived shared features that connect the two entities. For example, a person studying the ontological roots of human languages (etymology) might ask whether there is kinship between the English word &quot;seven&quot; and the German word &quot;sieben&quot;. It can be used in a more diffuse sense as in, for example, the news headline &quot;Madonna feels kinship with vilified Wallis Simpson&quot;, to imply a felt similarity or empathy between two or more entities.

In biology, &quot;kinship&quot; typically refers to the degree of genetic relatedness or the coefficient of relationship between individual members of a species (e.g. as in kin selection theory). It may also be used in this specific sense when applied to human relationships, in which case its meaning is closer to consanguinity or genealogy.

== Basic concepts ==

=== Family types ===
Family is a group of people affiliated by consanguinity (by recognized birth), affinity (by marriage), or co-residence/shared consumption (see Nurture kinship). In most societies, it is the principal institution for the socialization of children. As the basic unit for raising children, Anthropologists most generally classify family organization as matrifocal (a mother and her children); conjugal (a husband, his wife, and children; also called nuclear family); avuncular (a brother, his sister, and her children); or extended family in which parents and children co-reside with other members of one parent&#x27;s family.

However, producing children is not the only function of the family; in societies with a sexual division of labor, marriage, and the resulting relationship between two people, it is necessary for the formation of an economically productive household.

=== Terminology ===
Different societies classify kinship relations differently and therefore use different systems of kinship terminology – for example some languages distinguish between affinal and consanguine uncles, whereas others
have only one word to refer to both a father and his brothers. Kinship terminologies include the terms of address used in different languages or communities for different relatives and the terms of reference used to identify the relationship of these relatives to ego or to each other.

Kin terminologies can be either descriptive or classificatory. When a descriptive terminology is used, a term refers to only one specific type of relationship, while a classificatory terminology groups many different types of relationships under one term. For example, the word &quot;brother&quot; in English-speaking societies indicates a son of one&#x27;s same parent; thus, English-speaking societies use the word &quot;brother&quot; as a descriptive term referring to this relationship only. In many other classificatory kinship terminologies, in contrast, a person&#x27;s male first cousin (whether mother&#x27;s brother&#x27;s son, mother&#x27;s sister&#x27;s son, father&#x27;s brother&#x27;s son, father&#x27;s sister&#x27;s son) may also be referred to as brothers.

The major patterns of kinship systems that are known which Lewis Henry Morgan identified through kinship terminology in his 1871 work &quot;Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family&quot; are:
* Iroquois kinship (also known as &quot;bifurcate merging&quot;)
* Crow kinship (an expansion of bifurcate merging)
* Omaha kinship (also an expansion of bifurcate merging)
* Eskimo kinship (also referred to as &quot;lineal kinship&quot;)
* Hawaiian kinship (also referred to as the &quot;generational system&quot;)
* Sudanese kinship (also referred to as the &quot;descriptive system&quot;)

There is a seventh type of system only identified as distinct later:
* Dravidian kinship (the classical type of classificatory kinship, with bifurcate merging but totally distinct from Iroquois). Most Australian Aboriginal kinship is also classificatory.

The six types (Crow, Eskimo, Hawaiian, Iroquois, Omaha, Sudanese) that are not fully classificatory (Dravidian, Australian) are those identified by Murdock (1949) prior to Lounsbury&#x27;s (1964) rediscovery of the linguistic principles of classificatory kin terms.

==== Tri-relational kin-terms ====

While normal kin-terms discussed above denote a relationship between two entities (e.g. the word &#x27;sister&#x27; denotes the relationship between the speaker or some other entity and another feminine entity who shares the parents of the former), trirelational kin-terms—also known as triangular, triadic, ternary, and shared kin-terms—denote a relationship between three distinct entities. These occur commonly in Australian Aboriginal languages with the context of Australian Aboriginal kinship.

In Bininj Kunwok, for example, the bi-relational kin-term &quot;nakurrng&quot; is differentiated from its tri-relational counterpart by the position of the possessive pronoun &quot;ke&quot;. When &quot;nakurrng&quot; is anchored to the addressee with &quot;ke&quot; in the second position, it simply means &#x27;brother&#x27; (which includes a broader set of relations than in English). When the &quot;ke&quot; is fronted, however, the term &quot;nakurrng&quot; now incorporates the male speaker as a propositus (P i.e. point of reference for a kin-relation) and encapsulates the entire relationship as follows:
* The person (R) who is your (A) maternal uncle and who is my (S) nephew by virtue of you being my grandchild.

==== Kin-based group terms and pronouns ====
Many Australian languages also have elaborate systems of referential terms for denoting groups of people based on their relationship to one another (not just their relationship to the speaker or an external propositus like &#x27;grandparents&#x27;). For example, in Kuuk Thaayorre&quot;,&quot; a maternal grandfather and his sister are referred to as &quot;paanth ngan-ngethe&quot; and addressed with the vocative &quot;ngethin.&quot; In Bardi, a father and his sister are &quot;irrmoorrgooloo&quot;; a man&#x27;s wife and his children are &quot;aalamalarr.&quot;

In Murrinh-patha, nonsingular pronouns are differentiated not only by the gender makeup of the group, but also by the members&#x27; interrelation. If the members are in a sibling-like relation, a third pronoun (SIB) will be chosen distinct from the Masculine (MASC) and Feminine/Neuter (FEM).

=== Descent ===

==== Descent rules ====
In many societies where kinship connections are important, there are rules, though they may be expressed or be taken for granted. There are four main headings that anthropologists use to categorize rules of descent. They are bilateral, unilineal, ambilineal and double descent.
* Bilateral descent or two-sided descent affiliates an individual more or less equally with relatives on his father&#x27;s and mother&#x27;s sides. A good example is the Yakurr of the Crossriver state of Nigeria.
* Unilineal rules affiliates an individual through the descent of one sex only, that is, either through males or through females. They are subdivided into two: patrilineal (male) and matrilineal (female). Most societies are patrilineal. Examples of a matrilineal system of descent are the Nyakyusa of Tanzania and the Nair of India. Many societies that practise a matrilineal system often have a matrilocal residence but men still exercise significant authority.
* Ambilineal (or Cognatic) rule affiliates an individual with kinsmen through the father&#x27;s or mother&#x27;s line. Some people in societies that practise this system affiliate with a group of relatives through their fathers and others through their mothers. The individual can choose which side he wants to affiliate to. The Samoans of the South Pacific are an excellent example of an ambilineal society. The core members of the Samoan descent group can live together in the same compound.
* Double descent (or double unilineal descent) refers to societies in which both the patrilineal and matrilineal descent group are recognized. In these societies an individual affiliates for some purposes with a group of patrilineal kinsmen and for other purposes with a group of matrilineal kinsmen. Individuals in societies that practice this are recognized as a part of multiple descent groups, usually at least two. The most widely known case of double descent is the Afikpo of Imo state in Nigeria. Although patrilineage is considered an important method of organization, the Afikpo considers matrilineal ties to be more important.

==== Descent groups ====
A descent group is a social group whose members talk about common ancestry. A unilineal society is one in which the descent of an individual is reckoned either from the mother&#x27;s or the father&#x27;s line of descent. Matrilineal descent is based on relationship to females of the family line. A child would not be recognized with their father&#x27;s family in these societies, but would be seen as a member of their mother&#x27;s family&#x27;s line. Simply put, individuals belong to their mother&#x27;s descent group. Matrilineal descent includes the mother&#x27;s brother, who in some societies may pass along inheritance to the sister&#x27;s children or succession to a sister&#x27;s son. Conversely, with patrilineal descent, individuals belong to their father&#x27;s descent group. Children are recognized as members of their father&#x27;s family, and descent is based on relationship to males of the family line. Societies with the Iroquois kinship system, are typically unilineal, while the Iroquois proper are specifically matrilineal.

In a society which reckons descent bilaterally (bilineal), descent is reckoned through both father and mother, without unilineal descent groups. Societies with the Eskimo kinship system, like the Inuit, Yupik, and most Western societies, are typically bilateral. The egocentric kindred group is also typical of bilateral societies. Additionally, the Batek people of Malaysia recognize kinship ties through both parents&#x27; family lines, and kinship terms indicate that neither parent nor their families are of more or less importance than the other.

Some societies reckon descent patrilineally for some purposes, and matrilineally for others. This arrangement is sometimes called double descent. For instance, certain property and titles may be inherited through the male line, and others through the female line.

Societies can also consider descent to be ambilineal (such as Hawaiian kinship) where offspring determine their lineage through the matrilineal line or the patrilineal line.

==== Lineages, clans, phratries, moieties, and matrimonial sides ====
A lineage is a unilineal descent group that can demonstrate their common descent from a known apical ancestor. Unilineal lineages can be matrilineal or patrilineal, depending on whether they are traced through mothers or fathers, respectively. Whether matrilineal or patrilineal descent is considered most significant differs from culture to culture.

A clan is generally a descent group claiming common descent from an apical ancestor. Often, the details of parentage are not important elements of the clan tradition. Non-human apical ancestors are called totems. Examples of clans are found in Chechen, Chinese, Irish, Japanese, Polish, Scottish, Tlingit, and Somali societies.

A phratry is a descent group composed of three or more clans each of whose apical ancestors are descended from a further common ancestor.

If a society is divided into exactly two descent groups, each is called a moiety, after the French word for &quot;half&quot;. If the two halves are each obliged to marry out, and into the other, these are called matrimonial moieties. Houseman and White (1998b, bibliography) have discovered numerous societies where kinship network analysis shows that two halves marry one another, similar to matrimonial moieties, except that the two halves—which they call matrimonial &quot;sides&quot;—are neither named nor descent groups, although the egocentric kinship terms may be consistent with the pattern of sidedness, whereas the sidedness is culturally evident but imperfect.

The word &quot;deme&quot; refers to an endogamous local population that does not have unilineal descent. Thus, a deme is a local endogamous community without internal segmentation into clans.

==== House societies ====

In some societies kinship and political relations are organized around membership in corporately organized dwellings rather than around descent groups or lineages, as in the &quot;House of Windsor&quot;. The concept of a house society was originally proposed by Claude Lévi-Strauss who called them &quot;sociétés à maison&quot;. The concept has been applied to understand the organization of societies from Mesoamerica and the Moluccas to North Africa and medieval Europe. Lévi-Strauss introduced the concept as an alternative to &#x27;corporate kinship group&#x27; among the cognatic kinship groups of the Pacific region. The socially significant groupings within these societies have variable membership because kinship is reckoned bilaterally (through both father&#x27;s and mother&#x27;s kin) and comes together for only short periods. Property, genealogy and residence are not the basis for the group&#x27;s existence.

=== Marriage (affinity) ===

Marriage is a socially or ritually recognized union or legal contract between spouses that establishes rights and obligations between them, between them and their children, and between them and their in-laws. The definition of marriage varies according to different cultures, but it is principally an institution in which interpersonal relationships, usually intimate and sexual, are acknowledged. When defined broadly, marriage is considered a cultural universal. A broad definition of marriage includes those that are monogamous, polygamous, same-sex and temporary.

The act of marriage usually creates normative or legal obligations between the individuals involved, and any offspring they may produce. Marriage may result, for example, in &quot;a union between a man and a woman such that children born to the woman are the recognized legitimate offspring of both partners.&quot; Edmund Leach argued that no one definition of marriage applied to all cultures, but offered a list of ten rights frequently associated with marriage, including sexual monopoly and rights with respect to children (with specific rights differing across cultures).

There is wide cross-cultural variation in the social rules governing the selection of a partner for marriage. In many societies, the choice of partner is limited to suitable persons from specific social groups. In some societies the rule is that a partner is selected from an individual&#x27;s own social group – endogamy, this is the case in many class and caste based societies. But in other societies a partner must be chosen from a different group than one&#x27;s own – exogamy, this is the case in many societies practicing totemic religion where society is divided into several exogamous totemic clans, such as most Aboriginal Australian societies. Marriages between parents and children, or between full siblings, with few exceptions, have been considered incest and forbidden. However, marriages between more distant relatives have been much more common, with one estimate being that 80% of all marriages in history have been between second cousins or closer.

=== Alliance (marital exchange systems) ===

Systemic forms of preferential marriage may have wider social implications in terms of economic and political organization. In a wide array of lineage-based societies with a classificatory kinship system, potential spouses are sought from a specific class of relatives as determined by a prescriptive marriage rule. Insofar as regular marriages following prescriptive rules occur, lineages are linked together in fixed relationships; these ties between lineages may form political alliances in kinship dominated societies. French structural anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss developed the alliance theory to account for the &quot;elementary&quot; kinship structures created by the limited number of prescriptive marriage rules possible.

Claude Lévi-Strauss argued in &quot;The Elementary Structures of Kinship&quot; (1949), that the incest taboo necessitated the exchange of women between kinship groups. Levi-Strauss thus shifted the emphasis from descent groups to the stable &quot;structures&quot; or relations between groups that preferential and prescriptive marriage rules created.

== History ==

One of the foundational works in the anthropological study of kinship was Morgan&#x27;s &quot;Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family&quot; (1871). As is the case with other social sciences, Anthropology and kinship studies emerged at a time when the understanding of the Human species&#x27; comparative place in the world was somewhat different from today&#x27;s. Evidence that life in stable social groups is not just a feature of humans, but also of many other primates, was yet to emerge and society was considered to be a uniquely human affair. As a result, early kinship theorists saw an apparent need to explain not only the details of &quot;how&quot; human social groups are constructed, their patterns, meanings and obligations, but also &quot;why&quot; they are constructed at all. The &quot;why&quot; explanations thus typically presented the fact of life in social groups (&quot;which appeared to be unique to humans&quot;) as being largely a result of human ideas and values.

=== Morgan&#x27;s early influence ===

Morgan&#x27;s explanation for why humans live in groups was largely based on the notion that all humans have an inherent &quot;natural valuation&quot; of genealogical ties (an unexamined assumption that would remain at the heart of kinship studies for another century, see below), and therefore also an inherent desire to construct social groups around these ties. Even so, Morgan found that members of a society who are &quot;not&quot; close genealogical relatives may nevertheless use what he called &quot;kinship terms&quot; (which he considered to be originally based on genealogical ties). This fact was already evident in his use of the term &quot;affinity&quot; within his concept of the &quot;system of kinship&quot;. The most lasting of Morgan&#x27;s contributions was his discovery of the difference between descriptive and classificatory kinship terms, which situated broad kinship classes on the basis of imputing abstract social patterns of relationships having little or no overall relation to genetic closeness but instead cognition about kinship, social distinctions as they affect linguistic usages in kinship terminology, and strongly relate, if only by approximation, to patterns of marriage.

=== Kinship networks and social process ===

A more flexible view of kinship was formulated in British social anthropology. Among the attempts to break out of universalizing assumptions and theories about kinship, Radcliffe-Brown (1922, The Andaman Islands; 1930, The social organization of Australian tribes) was the first to assert that kinship relations are best thought of as concrete networks of relationships among individuals. He then described these relationships, however, as typified by interlocking interpersonal roles. Malinowski (1922, Argonauts of the Western Pacific) described patterns of events with concrete individuals as participants stressing the relative stability of institutions and communities, but without insisting on abstract systems or models of kinship. Gluckman (1955, The judicial process among the Barotse of Northern Rhodesia) balanced the emphasis on stability of institutions against processes of change and conflict, inferred through detailed analysis of instances of social interaction to infer rules and assumptions. John Barnes, Victor Turner, and others, affiliated with Gluckman&#x27;s Manchester school of anthropology, described patterns of actual network relations in communities and fluid situations in urban or migratory context, as with the work of J. Clyde Mitchell (1965, Social Networks in Urban Situations). Yet, all these approaches clung to a view of stable functionalism, with kinship as one of the central stable institutions. More recently, under the influence of &quot;new kinship studies&quot;, there has been a shift of emphasis from the being to the doing of kinship. A new generation of anthropologist study the processes of doing kinship in new contexts such as in migrant communities and in queer families.

=== &quot;Kinship system&quot; as systemic pattern ===

The concept of &quot;system of kinship&quot; tended to dominate anthropological studies of kinship in the early 20th century. Kinship systems as defined in anthropological texts and ethnographies were seen as constituted by patterns of behavior and attitudes in relation to the differences in terminology, listed above, for referring to relationships as well as for addressing others. Many anthropologists went so far as to see, in these patterns of kinship, strong relations between kinship categories and patterns of marriage, including forms of marriage, restrictions on marriage, and cultural concepts of the boundaries of incest. A great deal of inference was necessarily involved in such constructions as to &quot;systems&quot; of kinship, and attempts to construct systemic patterns and reconstruct kinship evolutionary histories on these bases were largely invalidated in later work. However, anthropologist Dwight Read later argued that the way in which kinship categories are defined by individual researchers are substantially inconsistent. This not only occurs when working within a systemic cultural model that can be elicited in fieldwork, but also when allowing considerable individual variability in details, such as when they are recorded through relative products.

=== Conflicting theories of the mid 20th century ===

In trying to resolve the problems of dubious inferences about kinship &quot;systems&quot;, George P. Murdock (1949, Social Structure) compiled kinship data to test a theory about universals in human kinship in the way that terminologies were influenced by the behavioral similarities or social differences among pairs of kin, proceeding on the view that the psychological ordering of kinship systems radiates out from ego and the nuclear family to different forms of extended family. Lévi-Strauss (1949, Les Structures Elementaires), on the other hand, also looked for global patterns to kinship, but viewed the &quot;elementary&quot; forms of kinship as lying in the ways that families were connected by marriage in different fundamental forms resembling those of modes of exchange: symmetric and direct, reciprocal delay, or generalized exchange.

=== Recognition of fluidity in kinship meanings and relations ===

Building on Lévi-Strauss&#x27;s (1949) notions of kinship as caught up with the fluid languages of exchange, Edmund Leach (1961, Pul Eliya) argued that kinship was a flexible idiom that had something of the grammar of a language, both in the uses of terms for kin but also in the fluidities of language, meaning, and networks. His field studies criticized the ideas of structural-functional stability of kinship groups as corporations with charters that lasted long beyond the lifetimes of individuals, which had been the orthodoxy of British Social Anthropology. This sparked debates over whether kinship could be resolved into specific organized sets of rules and components of meaning, or whether kinship meanings were more fluid, symbolic, and independent of grounding in supposedly determinate relations among individuals or groups, such as those of descent or prescriptions for marriage.

From the 1950s onwards, reports on kinship patterns in the New Guinea Highlands added some momentum to what had until then been only occasional fleeting suggestions that living together (co-residence) might underlie social bonding, and eventually contributed to the general shift away from a genealogical approach (see below section). For example, on the basis of his observations, Barnes suggested:

Similarly, Langness&#x27; ethnography of the &quot;Bena Bena&quot; also emphasized the primacy of residence patterns in &#x27;creating&#x27; kinship ties:

In 1972 David M. Schneider raised deep problems with the notion that human social bonds and &#x27;kinship&#x27; was a natural category built upon genealogical ties and made a fuller argument in his 1984 book &quot;A Critique of the Study of Kinship&quot; which had a major influence on the subsequent study of kinship.

=== Schneider&#x27;s critique of genealogical concepts ===

Before the questions raised within anthropology about the study of &#x27;kinship&#x27; by David M. Schneider and others from the 1960s onwards, anthropology itself had paid very little attention to the notion that kinship bonds were anything other than connected to consanguineal (or genealogical) relatedness (or its local cultural conceptions). Schneider&#x27;s 1968 study of the symbolic meanings surrounding ideas of kinship in American Culture found that Americans ascribe a special significance to &#x27;blood ties&#x27; as well as related symbols like the naturalness of marriage and raising children within this culture. In later work (1972 and 1984) Schneider argued that unexamined genealogical notions of kinship had been embedded in anthropology since Morgan&#x27;s early work because American anthropologists (and anthropologists in western Europe) had made the mistake of assuming these &quot;particular cultural values&quot; of &#x27;blood is thicker than water&#x27;, common in their own societies, were &#x27;natural&#x27; and universal for all human cultures (i.e. a form of ethnocentrism). He concluded that, due to these unexamined assumptions, the whole enterprise of &#x27;kinship&#x27; in anthropology may have been built on faulty foundations. His 1984 book &quot;A Critique of The Study of Kinship&quot; gave his fullest account of this critique.

Schneider himself emphasised a distinction between the notion of a social relationship as intrinsically &quot;given&quot; and inalienable (&quot;from birth&quot;), and a social relationship as created, constituted and maintained by a process of interaction, or &quot;doing&quot; (Schneider 1984, 165). Schneider used the example of the citamangen / fak relationship in Yap society, that his own early research had previously glossed over as a &quot;father / son&quot; relationship, to illustrate the problem;

Schneider preferred to focus on these often ignored processes of &quot;performance, forms of doing, various codes for conduct, different roles&quot; (p. 72) as the most important constituents of kinship. His critique quickly prompted a new generation of anthropologists to reconsider how they conceptualized, observed and described social relationships (&#x27;kinship&#x27;) in the cultures they studied.

=== Post-Schneider ===
Schneider&#x27;s critique is widely acknowledged to have marked a turning point in anthropology&#x27;s study of social relationships and interactions. Some anthropologists moved forward with kinship studies by teasing apart biological and social aspects, prompted by Schneider&#x27;s question;

Schneider also dismissed the sociobiological account of biological influences, maintaining that these did not fit the ethnographic evidence (see more below). Janet Carsten employed her studies with the Malays to reassess kinship. She uses the idea of &quot;relatedness&quot; to move away from a pre-constructed analytic opposition between the biological and the social. Carsten argued that relatedness should be described in terms of indigenous statements and practices, some of which fall outside what anthropologists have conventionally understood as kinship;

Philip Thomas&#x27; work with the Temanambondro of Madagascar highlights that nurturing processes are considered to be the &#x27;basis&#x27; for kinship ties in this culture, notwithstanding genealogical connections;

Similar ethnographic accounts have emerged from a variety of cultures since Schneider&#x27;s intervention. The concept of nurture kinship highlights the extent to which kinship relationships may be brought into being through the performance of various acts of nurture between individuals. Additionally the concept highlights ethnographic findings that, in a wide swath of human societies, people understand, conceptualize and symbolize their relationships predominantly in terms of giving, receiving and sharing nurture. These approaches were somewhat forerun by Malinowski, in his ethnographic study of sexual behaviour on the Trobriand Islands which noted that the Trobrianders did not believe pregnancy to be the result of sexual intercourse between the man and the woman, and they denied that there was any physiological relationship between father and child. Nevertheless, while paternity was unknown in the &quot;full biological sense&quot;, for a woman to have a child without having a husband was considered socially undesirable. Fatherhood was therefore recognised as a social and nurturing role; the woman&#x27;s husband is the &quot;man whose role and duty it is to take the child in his arms and to help her in nursing and bringing it up&quot;; &quot;Thus, though the natives are ignorant of any physiological need for a male in the constitution of the family, they regard him as indispensable socially&quot;.

== Biology, psychology and kinship ==
Like Schneider, other anthropologists of kinship have largely rejected sociobiological accounts of human social patterns as being both reductionistic and also empirically incompatible with ethnographic data on human kinship. Notably, Marshall Sahlins strongly critiqued the sociobiological approach through reviews of ethnographies in his 1976 &quot;The Use and Abuse of Biology&quot; noting that for humans &quot;the categories of &#x27;near&#x27; and &#x27;distant&#x27; [kin] vary independently of consanguinal distance and that these categories organize actual social practice&quot; (p. 112).

Independently from anthropology, biologists studying organisms&#x27; social behaviours and relationships have been interested to understand under what conditions significant social behaviors can evolve to become a typical feature of a species (see inclusive fitness theory). Because complex social relationships and cohesive social groups are common not only to humans, but also to most primates, biologists maintain that these biological theories of sociality should in principle be generally applicable. The more challenging question arises as to how such ideas can be applied to the human species whilst fully taking account of the extensive ethnographic evidence that has emerged from anthropological research on kinship patterns.

Early developments of biological inclusive fitness theory and the derivative field of Sociobiology, encouraged some sociobiologists and evolutionary psychologists to approach human kinship with the assumption that inclusive fitness theory predicts that kinship relations in humans &quot;are indeed&quot; expected to depend on genetic relatedness, which they readily connected with the &quot;genealogy&quot; approach of early anthropologists such as Morgan (see above sections). However, this is the position that Schneider, Sahlins and other anthropologists explicitly reject.

=== Nonreductive biology and nurture kinship ===
In agreement with Schneider, Holland argued that an accurate account of biological theory and evidence supports the view that social bonds (and kinship) are indeed mediated by a shared social environment and processes of frequent interaction, care and nurture, rather than by genealogical relationships &quot;per se&quot; (even if genealogical relationships frequently correlate with such processes). In his 2012 book &quot;Social bonding and nurture kinship&quot; Holland argues that sociobiologists and later evolutionary psychologists misrepresent biological theory, mistakenly believing that inclusive fitness theory predicts that genetic relatedness &quot;per se&quot; is the condition that &quot;mediates&quot; social bonding and social cooperation in organisms. Holland points out that the biological theory (see inclusive fitness) only specifies that a statistical relationship between social behaviors and genealogical relatedness is a criterion for the &quot;evolution&quot; of social behaviors. The theory&#x27;s originator, W. D. Hamilton considered that organisms&#x27; social behaviours were likely to be mediated by general conditions that typically &quot;correlate&quot; with genetic relatedness, but are not likely to be mediated by genetic relatedness &quot;per se&quot; (see Human inclusive fitness and Kin recognition). Holland reviews fieldwork from social mammals and primates to show that social bonding and cooperation in these species is indeed mediated through processes of shared living context, familiarity and attachments, not by genetic relatedness &quot;per se&quot;. Holland thus argues that both the biological &quot;theory&quot; and the biological &quot;evidence&quot; is nondeterministic and nonreductive, and that biology as a theoretical and empirical endeavor (as opposed to &#x27;biology&#x27; as a cultural-symbolic nexus as outlined in Schneider&#x27;s 1968 book) actually supports the &quot;nurture kinship&quot; perspective of cultural anthropologists working post-Schneider (see above sections). Holland argues that, whilst there is nonreductive compatibility around human kinship between anthropology, biology and psychology, for a full account of kinship in any &quot;particular&quot; human culture, ethnographic methods, including accounts of the people themselves, the analysis of historical contingencies, symbolic systems, economic and other cultural influences, remain centrally important.

Holland&#x27;s position is widely supported by both cultural anthropologists and biologists as an approach which, according to Robin Fox, &quot;gets to the heart of the matter concerning the contentious relationship between kinship categories, genetic relatedness and the prediction of behavior&quot;.

=== Evolutionary psychology ===
The other approach, that of Evolutionary psychology, continues to take the view that genetic relatedness (or genealogy) is key to understanding human kinship patterns. In contrast to Sahlin&#x27;s position (above), Daly and Wilson argue that &quot;the categories of &#x27;near&#x27; and &#x27;distant&#x27; do not &#x27;vary independently of consanguinal distance&#x27;, not in any society on earth.&quot; (Daly et al. 1997, p282). A current view is that humans have an inborn but culturally affected system for detecting certain forms of genetic relatedness. One important factor for sibling detection, especially relevant for older siblings, is that if an infant and one&#x27;s mother are seen to care for the infant, then the infant and oneself are assumed to be related. Another factor, especially important for younger siblings who cannot use the first method, is that persons who grew up together see one another as related. Yet another may be genetic detection based on the major histocompatibility complex (See Major Histocompatibility Complex and Sexual Selection). This kinship detection system in turn affects other genetic predispositions such as the incest taboo and a tendency for altruism towards relatives.

One issue within this approach is why many societies organize according to descent (see below) and not exclusively according to kinship. An explanation is that kinship does not form clear boundaries and is centered differently for each individual. In contrast, descent groups usually do form clear boundaries and provide an easy way to create cooperative groups of various sizes.

According to an evolutionary psychology hypothesis that assumes that descent systems are optimized to assure high genetic probability of relatedness between lineage members, males should prefer a patrilineal system if paternal certainty is high; males should prefer a matrilineal system if paternal certainty is low. Some research supports this association with one study finding no patrilineal society with low paternity confidence and no matrilineal society with high paternal certainty. Another association is that pastoral societies are relatively more often patrilineal compared to horticultural societies. This may be because wealth in pastoral societies in the form of mobile cattle can easily be used to pay bride price which favor concentrating resources on sons so they can marry.

The evolutionary psychology account of biology continues to be rejected by most cultural anthropologists.

== Extensions of the kinship metaphor ==

=== Fictive kinship ===
=== Detailed terms for parentage ===

As social and biological concepts of parenthood are not necessarily coterminous, the terms &quot;pater&quot; and &quot;genitor&quot; have been used in anthropology to distinguish between the man who is socially recognised as father (pater) and the man who is believed to be the physiological parent (genitor); similarly the terms &quot;mater&quot; and &quot;genitrix&quot; have been used to distinguish between the woman socially recognised as mother (mater) and the woman believed to be the physiological parent (genitrix). Such a distinction is useful when the individual who is considered the legal parent of the child is not the individual who is believed to be the child&#x27;s biological parent. For example, in his ethnography of the Nuer, Evans-Pritchard notes that if a widow, following the death of her husband, chooses to live with a lover outside of her deceased husband&#x27;s kin group, that lover is only considered genitor of any subsequent children the widow has, and her deceased husband continues to be considered the pater. As a result, the lover has no legal control over the children, who may be taken away from him by the kin of the pater when they choose. The terms &quot;pater&quot; and &quot;genitor&quot; have also been used to help describe the relationship between children and their parents in the context of divorce in Britain. Following the divorce and remarriage of their parents, children find themselves using the term &quot;mother&quot; or &quot;father&quot; in relation to more than one individual, and the pater or mater who is legally responsible for the child&#x27;s care, and whose family name the child uses, may not be the genitor or genitrix of the child, with whom a separate parent-child relationship may be maintained through arrangements such as visitation rights or joint custody.

It is important to note that the terms &quot;genitor&quot; or &quot;genetrix&quot; do not necessarily imply actual biological relationships based on consanguinity, but rather refer to the socially held belief that the individual is physically related to the child, derived from culturally held ideas about how biology works. So, for example, the Ifugao may believe that an illegitimate child might have more than one physical father, and so nominate more than one genitor. J.A. Barnes therefore argued that it was necessary to make a further distinction between genitor and genitrix (the supposed biological mother and father of the child), and the actual genetic father and mother of the child making them share their genes or genetics .

===Composition of relations===

The study of kinship may be abstracted to binary relations between people. For example, if &quot;x&quot; is the parent of &quot;y&quot;, the relation may be symbolized as &quot;xPy&quot;. The converse relation, that &quot;y&quot; is the child of &quot;x&quot;, is written &quot;yP&quot;T&quot;x&quot;. Suppose that &quot;z&quot; is another child of &quot;x&quot;: &quot;zP&quot;T&quot;x&quot;. Then &quot;y&quot; is a sibling of &quot;z&quot; as they share the parent &quot;x&quot;: . Here the relation of siblings is expressed as the composition &quot;P&quot;T&quot;P&quot; of the parent relation with its inverse.

The relation of grandparent is the composition of the parent relation with itself: . An uncle or aunt is the sibling of a parent, &quot;(P&quot;T&quot;P)P&quot;, which can also be interpreted as the child of a grandparent, &quot;P&quot;T&quot;(PP)&quot;. Suppose &quot;x&quot; is the grandparent of &quot;y&quot;: &quot;xGy&quot;. Then &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; are cousins if &quot;yG&quot;T&quot;xGz&quot;.

The symbols applied here to express kinship are used more generally in algebraic logic to develop a calculus of relations with sets other than human beings.

<text>Nolita, sometimes written as NoLIta and deriving from &quot;Northern Little Italy&quot;, is a neighborhood in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. Nolita is situated in Lower Manhattan, bounded on the north by Houston Street, on the east by the Bowery, on the south roughly by Broome Street, and on the west by Lafayette Street. It lies east of SoHo, south of NoHo, west of the Lower East Side, and north of Little Italy and Chinatown.

==History and description==
The neighborhood was long regarded as part of Little Italy, but has lost its recognizable Italian character in recent decades because of rapidly rising rents. The Feast of San Gennaro, dedicated to Saint Januarius (&quot;Pope of Naples&quot;), is held in the neighborhood every year following Labor Day, on Mulberry Street between Houston and Grand Streets. The feast, as recreated on Elizabeth Street between Prince and Houston Streets, was featured in the film &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;.

In the second half of the 1990s, the neighborhood saw an influx of yuppies and an explosion of expensive retail boutiques and restaurants and bars. After unsuccessful tries to pitch it as part of SoHo, real estate promoters and others came up with several different names for consideration for this newly upscale neighborhood. The name that stuck, as documented in an article on May 5, 1996, in the &quot;New York Times&quot; city section debating various monikers for the newly trendy area, was &quot;Nolita&quot;, an abbreviation for North of Little Italy. This name follows the pattern started by SoHo (South of Houston Street) and TriBeCa (Triangle Below Canal Street).

The neighborhood includes St. Patrick&#x27;s Old Cathedral, at the intersection of Mulberry, Mott, and Prince Streets, which opened in 1815 and was rebuilt in 1868 after a fire. The cornerstone was laid on June 8, 1809. This building served as New York City&#x27;s Roman Catholic cathedral until the new St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral was opened on Fifth Avenue in Midtown in 1879. St. Patrick&#x27;s Old Cathedral is now a parish church. In 2010, St. Patrick&#x27;s Old Cathedral was honored and became The Basilica at St. Patrick&#x27;s Old Cathedral.

The Puck Building, a nine-story-high ornate structure built in 1885 on the corner of Houston and Lafayette Streets, originally housed the headquarters of the now-defunct &quot;Puck&quot; Magazine.

Since 2010, a Little Australia has emerged in Nolita on Mulberry Street and Mott Street.

<text>The Air National Guard (ANG), also known as the Air Guard, is a federal military reserve force of the United States Air Force, as well as the air militia of each U.S. state, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the territories of Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It, along with the Army National Guard component of each state, district, commonwealth or territory, makes up the National Guard of each region as applicable.

When Air National Guard units are used under the jurisdiction of the state governor they are fulfilling their militia role. However, when federalized by order of the president of the United States, ANG units become an active part of the U.S. Air Force. They are jointly administered by the states and the National Guard Bureau, a joint bureau of the Army and Air Force that oversees the U.S. National Guard.

==History==

===Origins===
The modern day National Guard in the U.S. traces its origins to 13 December 1636, when the Massachusetts Bay Colony&#x27;s General Court passed an act calling for the creation of three regiments, organizing existing separate militia companies in and around Boston. The creation of the militia regiments was caused by the perceived need to defend the Bay Colony against American Indians and from other European countries operating in North America. This organization formed the basis of subsequent colonial and, post-independence, state and territorial militias which later became the Army National Guard.

Being &quot;local&quot; ground forces affiliated with the Army, militias were considered state-centric/territorial-centric in nature, this versus naval forces, which were considered wholly activities of the federal government. This distinction accounts for why there are no National Guard components in the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps or U.S. Coast Guard. Because the present day U.S. Air Force evolved from the U.S. Army, it was only natural that a separate Air National Guard would be established with the divestiture of the former U.S. Army Air Forces and its establishment as a separate and independent U.S. Air Force in 1947. 

The Air National Guard was officially established in law as a separate reserve component on 18 September 1947, concurrent with the establishment of the U.S. Air Force. However, National Guard aviation emerged before World War I with aviation units in Army National Guard organizations.

In April 1908, a group of enthusiasts organized an &quot;aeronautical corps&quot; at the Park Avenue Armory in New York City to learn ballooning. They were members of the 1st Company, Signal Corps, New York National Guard. Although they received instruction and assembled a balloon, it was not clear whether members of the unit had ever actually ascended in it. In 1910 the unit raised $500 to finance its first aircraft.

During the Mexican Border Crisis of 1915 Captain Raynal Cawthorne Bolling organized and took command of a unit that became the 1st Aero Company, New York National Guard. It trained at Mineola Field, Mineola, Long Island. It is recognized as the ANG&#x27;s oldest unit and its lineage is carried by the 102nd Rescue Squadron of the New York Air National Guard. On 13 July 1916, the 1st Aero Company mobilized during the border crisis with Mexico. the unit was called into federal service when the Mexican revolution spilled over the border into the United States. Bolling&#x27;s unit was joined at Mineola by the 2nd Aero Company of Buffalo and 12 Guard officers from other states. Both air units remained at Mineola during the crisis.

When the U.S. entered World War I in April 1917, the War Department decided that it would not mobilize National Guard air units. Instead, individual Guard volunteers provided a major pool for the Army to draw aviators from. They were required to leave the Guard and enter the Signal Corps Reserve if they wished to fly in the war. About 100 National Guard pilots joined the newly formed U.S. Army Air Service. Guardsmen also played prominent roles in air operations in France. On 14 April 1918, Tennessee guardsman Reed Chambers flew with Eddie Rickenbacker and David Peterson of the 94th Pursuit Squadron from Villeneuve, France on the first combat mission ever ordered by an American commander of a U.S. squadron of American pilots. At least four guardsmen—Chambers, Field Kindley (Kansas), Reed Landis (Illinois), and Martinus Stenseth (Minnesota) – became aces. 2nd Lieutenant Erwin R. Bleckley of Kansas was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously for his heroism as an aerial observer. After the armistice and the return of the American Expeditionary Force in 1919, the wartime squadrons were demobilized and inactivated.

===Interwar period===
After the war, National Guard aviation was placed on a permanent basis over the initial opposition of the Army&#x27;s General Staff. In 1920, the Militia Bureau and the Army Air Service agreed on a plan for re-organizing National Guard aviation units. On 17 January 1921, the 109th Observation Squadron of the Minnesota National Guard (1921–1941) became the first post World War I air unit to receive federal recognition. During the interwar period, 29 observation squadrons were established. They were either integral elements of National Guard infantry divisions or assigned to Army corps aviation.

An aviator in the 110th Observation Squadron of the Missouri National Guard (1923–1943) became the most famous National Guard pilot during the interwar period: Captain Charles A. Lindbergh. His service illustrated the close ties between military and commercial aviation. Trained to fly by the Army, he joined the 110th Observation Squadron in November 1925. The following year, he became chief pilot for an airmail venture started by fellow 110th pilots Major William Robertson and his brother Frank. After Lindbergh made his historic solo trans-Atlantic flight in May 1927, he recalled his service in the Guard fondly.

After the Fall of France, during 1940–1941, approximately 4,800 experienced National Guard aviation personnel were mobilized from their observation squadrons. They provided a significant augmentation of the Army&#x27;s rapidly expanding air arm during a critical period. Most Guard air units were stripped of many key personnel, and the units were federalized into the regular Army Air Corps and were re-equipped with more modern aircraft. Some of the early-deploying squadrons maintained a degree of unit integrity and cohesion. But, most lost their character and identity as Guard organizations during World War II.

The units were transformed from observation organizations into reconnaissance, liaison, fighter, and bombardment squadrons. They served in every major combat theater during the war. The most significant wartime contribution of National Guard aviators was to train and lead the large numbers of volunteer airmen who had entered the AAF. That role was epitomized by Lt Col Addison E. Baker, a guardsman from Akron, Ohio. On 1 August 1943, Baker commanded the VIII Bomber Command&#x27;s 93rd Bombardment Group on a daring but ill-fated low-level attack against enemy oil refineries at Ploiești, Romania. Baker was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroic leadership.

===Post-World War II Air National Guard===

The Air National Guard as it exists today, a separate reserve component of the United States Air Force in addition to the purely &quot;federal&quot; Air Force Reserve, was a product of the politics of postwar planning and inter-service rivalry during World War II. The Army Air Forces leaders who planned and maneuvered for an independent postwar Air Force during World War II had little confidence in the reserves of the U.S. Army, especially the state-dominated National Guard. On the contrary, those leaders expected to build the largest and most modern standing air force possible. However, domestic politics and American history forced them to significantly alter their plans.

Determined to include an Air Force National Guard in the postwar U.S. military establishment during World War II, the National Guard Association of the United States flexed its considerable political muscle. It compelled the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) to plan for a significant Air Force National Guard once the overseas fighting ended. General of the Army George C. Marshall, the Army chief of staff, also pressured the USAAF to revise its ambitious plans for a large postwar active duty force. When President Harry S. Truman instituted dramatic postwar military budget cuts, he split defense dollars evenly among the Army, Navy, and Air Force. That move also required the Air Force to plan for a far smaller active duty service than it had envisaged. As a result, the Air Force needed both reserve components, the Air National Guard and the Air Force Reserve, to help fill the gap.

As the wartime Army Air Forces demobilized in 1945 and 1946, inactivated unit designations were allotted and transferred to various State and Territorial Air National Guard bureaus to provide them unit designations to re-establish them as Air National Guard units. Initially, the National Guard Bureau (NGB) developed a table of organization for the Air National Guard to include at least one unit allocation per state. In addition, the territories of Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico were allocated one unit designation each. A table of organization was developed in which a series of twelve ANG Wings were allocated to provide command and control over separate regions of the United States; each Wing controlled three or four Groups within the region, and the Groups controlled squadrons within the region, sometimes distributed over several states.

On 21 August 1946, inactivated USAAF group and squadron designations were transferred from the Department of the Army to the National Guard Bureau. The units were re-designated with unit designations within the 101–299 range and allotments were made to Adjutant General of the states and territories whose mission it was to organize the units being allocated and prepare them for federal recognition by the NGB.

The combat element was organized into twelve wings which were then divided into 20 fighter groups totaling 62 squadrons, two light bombardment groups comprising four squadrons, and five composite groups with twelve fighter squadrons and six bombardment squadrons. Command and control organizations were:

* 86th Fighter Wing, Colorado
: Replaced by 140th Fighter Wing, 1 November 1950
:: 140th Fighter Group, Colorado
Individual state squadrons were assigned to either Groups or Wings, depending on circumstances, allocations, and gaining commands of the Army Air Forces. As individual units were organized, federally recognized, and activated, the Army Air Forces provided them airfields, equipment and surplus aircraft. Once formed, the units began obtaining federal recognition, and the state Air National Guard units were established. Its primary units were 84 flying squadrons, mostly equipped with P-51 Mustang and P-47 Thunderbolt fighters with air defense of the continental United States as their main mission, its units under the jurisdiction of the USAAF Air Defense Command. Tactical Air Command also had several ANG units being assigned B-26 Invader medium bombers.

18 September 1947, however, is considered the Air National Guard&#x27;s official birth, concurrent with the establishment of the United States Air Force as a separate branch of the United States military under the National Security Act. The postwar Air National Guard force of the late 1940s included 58,000 members. Between 1946 and 1949, all of the initial allotment of units received federal recognition in the CONUS. The Hawaii Territory ANG received recognition and was activated on 4 November 1946; the Puerto Rico ANG on 23 November 1947, and the Alaska Territory ANG on 15 September 1952.

At the end of October 1950, the Air National Guard converted to the wing-base (Hobson Plan) organization. As a result, the former Army Air Forces Wings which were allocated were inactivated by the National Guard Bureau returned to the control of the Department of the Air Force on 31 October 1950. The personnel and equipment of the inactivated wings were transferred to new Air National Guard wings which were established, recognized and activated on 1 November 1950.

After World War II, the Air National Guard developed an unfortunate reputation as a glorified &quot;flying club&quot; for World War II combat veterans. Not only did the units and individuals lack specific wartime missions, their equipment, especially aircraft, was obsolete and their training was usually deplorable. Once mobilized, those air national guardsmen proved to be almost totally unprepared for combat. Regardless of their previous training and equipment, Air National Guard units were assigned almost at random to major air commands. It took months and months for ANG units to become combat ready; some units never succeeded.

===Korean War===
During the Korean War, some 45,000 air guardsmen, 80 percent of the force, were mobilized. That callup exposed the weaknesses of the United States&#x27; various military reserve programs, including the ANG. Sixty-six of the Air Guard&#x27;s ninety-two flying squadrons, along with numerous support units, were mobilized. Once in federal service, they proved to be unprepared for combat. Many key air guardsmen were used as fillers elsewhere in the Air Force. It took three to six months for some ANG units to become combat ready. Some never did.

Eventually, they made substantial contributions to the war effort and the Air Force&#x27;s global buildup. In the Far East, the ANG&#x27;s 136th and 116th Fighter-Bomber Wings compiled excellent combat records flying F-84 Thunderjets. Air guardsmen flew 39,530 combat sorties and destroyed 39 enemy aircraft. But, 101 of them were either killed or declared missing in action during the conflict. Four air guardsmen—captains Robert Love (California), Clifford Jolley (Utah), and Robinson Risner (Oklahoma), plus Major James Hagerstrom (Texas) – became aces, with some, such as Risner, later transferring to the Regular Air Force. Largely as a result of the Korean War experience, senior ANG and Air Force leaders became seriously committed to building the Air National Guard as an effective reserve component.

With the reinforcement of the Far East Air Forces (FEAF), Air National Guard squadrons were deployed to Europe in late 1950, being assigned to newly constructed bases in France as part of United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE). These deployments helped reinforce the NATO commitment of the United States in case the combat in Korea became part of a wider conflict with the Soviet Union. Beginning in February 1951, mobilized units were assigned to Air Defense Command (ADC), Strategic Air Command (SAC) and Tactical Air Command (TAC), replacing or augmenting active duty units. Air national guardsmen assigned to ADC also were assigned to various aircraft control and warning as well as radar calibration units. Their organizations either strengthened American air defenses or were converted to tactical air control units that directed Air Force fighter aircraft in the continental United States, Alaska, Newfoundland, Europe, and French Morocco.

As a result of the federalization of the Air National Guard, ADC, SAC and TAC established additional wings for command and control of the federalized units. These were as follows:

* 101st Fighter-Interceptor Wing (ADC)
: Federalized Maine ANG, 10 February 1951
* 103rd Fighter-Interceptor Wing (ADC)
: Federalized Connecticut ANG, 2 March 1951
* 108th Strategic Fighter Wing (SAC)
: Federalized New Jersey ANG, 1 March 1951
* 122nd Fighter-Interceptor Wing (ADC)
: Federalized Indiana ANG, 10 February 1951

* 128th Fighter-Interceptor Wing (ADC)
: Federalized Wisconsin ANG, 10 February 1951
* 133rd Fighter-Interceptor Wing (ADC)
: Federalized Minnesota ANG, 2 March 1951
* 137th Fighter-Bomber Wing (TAC)
: Federalized Oklahoma ANG, 26 October 1950
* 142nd Fighter-Interceptor Wing (ADC)
: Federalized Oregon ANG, 2 March 1951
Air national cuardsmen began to be demobilized in July 1952, with their units being inactivated by the active duty air force. Subsequently, the individual state Air National Guard bureaus reactivated and reformed the units beginning in January 1953. The USAF-established wings were also allocated to their states.

===Runway alert program===

Although Korean War hostilities ended in July 1953, the Cold War with the Soviet Union persisted.
The initial mobilization fiasco forced the Air Force to achieve an accommodation with the Air National Guard and to thoroughly revamp its entire reserve system. Because of the problems associated with the Korean War mobilizations, the Air Force and its reserve components pioneered new approaches like the runway alert program to reserve training and management.

The Air Division chief at the National Guard Bureau wanted to find an innovative way to provide additional training for fighter pilots after their units were demobilized. At the same time, Air Defense Command could not call upon sufficient active duty Air Force units to defend the continental United States against the Soviet air threat. It was proposed to employ ANG pilots full-time from &quot;strategically placed&quot; Air National Guard units to perform &quot;air intercept missions&quot; against unidentified aircraft entering United States airspace. In addition they would &quot;provide simulated fighter attacks against the Strategic Air Command&#x27;s nuclear-capable bombers.&quot;

Using air national guardsmen from the 138th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Hancock Field, Syracuse, New York, and the 194th Fighter-Bomber Squadron at Hayward, California, the experiment began on 1 March 1953. It proved a great success and in August eight squadrons began &quot;standing alert&quot; using volunteer aircrews on a rotating basis for 14 hours a day. In October, nine more squadrons joined the program. The ANG runway alert program required some planes and pilots to be available around-the-clock to become airborne within minutes of being notified to scramble. At its peak in the mid-1950s, all 70 Air National Guard fighter squadrons participated in that program, although that number was reduced to 25 by 1961 due to budget constraints. Most of the runway alert exercises involved interceptions of SAC bombers; although a few actual scrambles turned out to be interceptions of late or off-course commercial airliners. The runway alert experiment in 1953 marked the beginning of the Air National Guard&#x27;s modern homeland defense role. Moreover, it was the first broad effort to integrate reserve units into a major Air Force combat mission in peacetime on a continuing basis using volunteers.

===Aircraft modernization===
Originally the Air National Guard was designed as a combat reserve force. After World War II, its flying units consisted of 72 fighter and 12 light bomber squadrons equipped with obsolescent World War II propeller-driven aircraft while the active duty Air Force transitioned to jet fighters. Although it had no airlift or tanker units, the Air National Guard&#x27;s flying units were equipped with a small number of liaison, trainer, and transport planes, and the Air National Guard actively sought out new missions and aircraft.

With the end of World War II, the Air Force dropped &quot;Air Commando&quot; or special operations units from its rolls, although they were revived for the Korean War. After that conflict, in April 1955, the Air National Guard acquired its first special operations unit when the 129th Air Resupply Squadron was federally recognized and two C-46 Commandos were delivered to it at Hayward, California. It was allocated to the Air Resupply And Communications Service (ARCS), a predecessor organization of today&#x27;s Air Force Special Operations Command

As its P-51 Mustangs and P-47 Thunderbolts became more and more obsolescent in the jet age of the 1950s, the force structure gradually changed to include a significant number of airlift, tanker, and specialized combat-support units. As the Air National Guard expanded, additional squadrons, including airlift units as well as Air Resupply and Communications units, were established. Additional command and control groups and wings were also established by the National Guard Bureau and allocated to the states. The ANG however, unlike the active duty USAF, did not inactivate its combat groups during the 1950s as part of the tri-deputate organization. Many of the combat groups remained assigned to the wings from which they were derived. It was not until 1974 that the ANG fully adapted the USAF tri-deputate organization and inactivated its combat groups, assigning its operational squadrons directly to the wings.

The Air National Guard aggressively worked to preserve its existing flying units by obtaining the most modern aircraft available. Some existing Air National Guard fighter units equipped with piston-driven fighters, however, could not convert to jets because the runways at the local airports where they were based were too short. In addition, some local leaders simply did not want jet fighters operating in their communities.

The ANG considered replacing the fighter squadrons in these instances with transport aircraft a viable option for overcoming runway issues or community objections and also was a way to keep experienced senior aviators in the cockpit. During the late 1950s, the Air Force allowed several Air National Guard units to trade in their aging piston-driven fighters for second-line transports. New Jersey&#x27;s newly organized 150th Air Transport Squadron (Light) became the first pure airlift unit in the Air National Guard on 1 February 1956. It received Curtiss C-46D Commandos. Two other aeromedical transport squadrons followed that year, primarily because of the impracticality of converting their locations to modern jet fighter operations. In 1959, the Air Force, in order to save operating funds, planned to phase out 48 C-97 Stratofreighters before their replacements were available to the active force. The Air National Guard requested these aircraft be sent to ANG units, and in January 1960, units in California, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, and Oklahoma began trading in their obsolete fighters for C-97s.

Additionally, the Air National Guard also took on an air refueling mission. The Air National Guard received its first KC-97 Stratofreighter aerial tankers in July and August 1961. During that period, the 108th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron in Illinois, the 126th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron in Wisconsin, and the 145th Air Transport Squadron in Ohio, converted to KC-97Fs and were redesignated air refueling squadrons.

===Cold War===

World War II had left the city of Berlin 100 miles deep within East German territory, controlled by the Soviet Union, and divided into Soviet, British, French, and United States zones of occupation, administered under local agreements which did not guarantee Western access to the city. Responding to a series of Soviet actions in 1948, the three western allies consolidated their zones and formed the city of West Berlin. For fifteen years the western powers maintained a tenacious hold on West Berlin under periodic harassment of the Soviets. On 13 August 1961, Berliners woke up to find they lived in a divided city. A wall now separated East Berlin from West Berlin. With that provocative act, the Soviet Union ratcheted up the Cold War.

President John F. Kennedy mobilized a limited number of Reserve and Guard units, dispatching 11 ANG fighter squadrons to Europe. All the Guard units were in place within a month of their respective mobilization days, although they required additional training, equipment, and personnel after being called up. In all, some 21,000 air guardsmen were mobilized during the 1961 Berlin Crisis.

By August 1962, the units mobilized for the Berlin Crisis returned to state control. They had hardly resumed normal operations when President Kennedy announced on 22 October 1962 that the Soviet Union had placed nuclear warheads in Cuba, only 90 miles from Florida. With the Cuban Missile Crisis, Air National Guard fighter units trained for &quot;no notice&quot; deployments, and volunteer ANG airlift crews and their aircraft augmented Air Force global airlift operations. Air National Guard bases hosted Air Force fighters and bombers dispersed there to avoid a possible Soviet nuclear response to the crisis. But in the end, no ANG unit was federalized.

As a result of these two Cold War incidents, from January through December 1963, for the first time Air National Guard airlift units began routinely deploying overseas during their annual training periods, primarily to Europe, to exercise their wartime missions. Air National Guard transport units hauled cargo for the Military Air Transport Service (MATS) while training for their wartime global airlift role.

With the Regular Air Force tanker fleet being used more and more in Southeast Asia after 1965 to support combat operations in South Vietnam, combined with the concurrent demands of the Strategic Air Command (SAC) for performing its nuclear deterrence mission, both volunteer Air Force reservists and air national guardsmen in air refueling units participated in worldwide air refueling missions during their Annual Training or other additional active duty periods in order to supplement the active duty tanker force. The Texas Air National Guard&#x27;s 136th Air Refueling Wing inaugurated Operation Creek Party on 1 May 1967, because the Regular Air Force did not have enough KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft available in Europe to train its fighter pilots in USAFE. The operation eventually involved nine ANG air refueling groups that rotated approximately every two weeks to Rhein-Main Air Base in West Germany.

The Vietnam War provided the next significant test for the Air National Guard. However, for largely domestic political reasons, President Lyndon B. Johnson chose not to mobilize most of the nation&#x27;s reserve forces before 1968. His reasons for not mobilizing reserve forces were many. Primarily, he did not believe that the war in Vietnam justified the dramatic act of mobilizing Reserve and National Guard forces. He accepted the need to fight the war, but he wanted to prosecute it as quietly as possible, not attracting too much attention at home and risk jeopardizing his domestic programs. He also wanted to avoid drawing the Communist Chinese into the war or the attention of the Soviet Union, the latter which might view the mobilization of Reserve and National Guard units as &quot;escalatory&quot; within a larger Cold War context. Moreover, recalling reservists&#x27; complaints of inactivity following the Berlin mobilization of 1961, he was also reluctant to recall reservists and national guardsmen without the assurance that their employment would significantly affect the course of the war, an assurance no official in his administration could provide. As a result, even though still populated by many World War II and Korean War combat veterans, the Reserves and the National Guard acquired ill-deserved reputations during this period as havens for relatively affluent, young white men with no prior active duty military service to serve as officers or enlisted personnel as a means to avoid the draft into the active duty U.S. Army in an enlisted status.

Air National Guard airlift units, however, began flying regularly to Japan and South Vietnam beginning in 1966 to support Military Airlift Command (MAC) operations. These flights continued on a regular basis until 1972. In addition, between August 1965 and September 1969, Air National Guard domestic and offshore aeromedical evacuation flights freed active duty Air Force resources for such missions in Southeast Asia (SEA).

Moreover, after the 1968 Tet Offensive in which the Communist North Vietnamese and Vietcong troops attacked positions throughout the Republic of Vietnam, the Pentagon dispatched four Air National Guard fighter squadrons to that nation. In addition, the Pueblo Crisis in Korea also saw mobilized air force reservists, air national guardsmen and naval reservists in flying units. That crisis prompted the third partial Air National Guard mobilization since the end of World War II, and eventually two ANG fighter squadrons were dispatched to South Korea. However, the Pueblo crisis ended without a resort to combat.

In July 1970, two EC-121 &quot;Super Constellations&quot; from the Pennsylvania ANG&#x27;s 193rd Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron departed their home station for Korat RTAFB, Thailand. During the next six months, approximately 60 Air National Guardsmen were rotated through the latter installation on 30- to 60-day tours in Operation &quot;Commando Buzz,&quot; their aircraft serving as flying radar stations and airborne control platforms for U.S. air operations in Southeast Asia (SEA) until January 1971.

The 355th Tactical Fighter Squadron (355th TFS) in 1967 was a Regular Air Force squadron assigned to the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing at Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina. From January 1968 until June 1969, the 355th TFS changed from a Regular Air Force unit composed almost entirely of recent SEA returnees to a composite squadron consisting of approximately 50% of whose personnel assets were composed of activated ANG members from the 119th TFS of the New Jersey ANG) and the 121st TFS of the District of Columbia ANG). The 355th deployed on temporary duty (TDY) to Phù Cát Air Base on 14 May 1968 with 13 of its 30 pilots being ANG members. The transfer became permanent on 26 June 1968, at which time all TDY members were offered the opportunity to volunteer for a full year&#x27;s tour. All 13 ANG pilots volunteered, one of whom was killed in action a month later. By Christmas 1968, 87% of the squadron&#x27;s support personnel were ANG members. Five of the ANG pilots also volunteered as &quot;Misty&quot; Forward Air Controllers (FACs) flying the F-100 Super Sabre. In all, ANG pilots were awarded 23 Silver Stars, 47 Distinguished Flying Crosses, and 46 Bronze Stars with Combat V for valor while stationed at Phu Cat.

===Total Force Concept===
As part of the re-thinking of military concepts after the Vietnam War, beginning in the early 1970s with the establishment of the All-Volunteer Armed Forces, both the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve force planning and policymaking were influenced by the &quot;Total Force&quot; Concept and have remained so to this day. The concept sought to strengthen and rebuild public confidence in the reserve forces while saving money by reducing the size of the active duty force. In practical terms, the Total Force policy sought to ensure that all policymaking, planning, programming, and budgetary activities within the Defense Department considered active and reserve forces concurrently and determined the most efficient mix of those forces in terms of costs versus contributions to national security. The policy also insured that reservists and guardsmen, not draftees, would be the first and primary source of manpower to augment the active duty forces in any future crisis.

With the active forces being reduced after the end of the Vietnam War, a significant number of older C-130A Hercules tactical airlifters became available for the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve, which allowed the Korean War-era C-119 Flying Boxcars and C-124 Globemasters to be retired. However, the Total Force Concept led to pressure to upgrade the reserve forces to front-line aircraft and beginning in 1974, new Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV) A-7D Corsair II ground attack aircraft began to be sent to Air National Guard units directly from the LTV manufacturing plant in Dallas. As A-10 Thunderbolt IIs began to replace the A-7Ds in the Regular Air Force in the mid and late 1970s, additional A-7D aircraft were transferred to the ANG. F-4 Phantom IIs began to be received by the ANG in the late 1970s with the F-15A Eagle and F-16A Fighting Falcons coming into the active inventory and ANG&#x27;s F-100 Super Sabres being retired.

Starting in 1975, the ANG began conducting operations in Latin America and by the late 1970s to defend the Panama Canal and to provide training support, embassy resupply, search and rescue, and counterdrug operations. In addition, the ANG airlifted supplies and hardware to remote radar sites and performed aerial mapping operations.

In June 1979, the 137th Tactical Airlift Wing of the Oklahoma Air National Guard marked the first time an ANG airlift unit was equipped with brand new transport aircraft: it received four factory-fresh C-130H Hercules aircraft. Several years later, Congress institutionalized the practice of purchasing limited amounts of new weapons and equipment for the reserve components via National Guard and Reserve Equipment (NG&amp;RE) funding allocations. Under the auspices of this separate appropriation for Guard and Reserve equipment established in 1982 under President Ronald Reagan, 69 brand new C-130s entered the ANG&#x27;s inventory from 1984 to 1991.

In July 1972, Air National Guard units began supporting Air Force tanker task forces overseas with second-line KC-97 Stratofreighter propeller-driven tankers and volunteer crews when needed. Triggered by a 1974 decision by Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger to save money, the Ohio Air National Guard&#x27;s 145th Air Refueling Squadron acquired the ANG&#x27;s first jet tanker in April 1975 when it began converting from KC-97Ls to KC-135A Stratotankers. Altogether, the Air Force transferred 128 older KC-135s to the air reserve components to retire the slow prop-driven tankers, which modern fighters had to reduce speed to nearly stall speed in order to refuel from.

During the 1980s, changes in the Air National Guard&#x27;s force structure and readiness were primarily driven by President Reagan&#x27;s military buildup and the need to prepare for a possible war between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact in Central Europe. The ANG focused on modernization, more realistic combat training, increased readiness, and personnel growth, primarily in nonflying, mission support units. In 1979, Tactical Air Command assumed the atmospheric air defense mission of the United States with the inactivation of Aerospace Defense Command (ADCOM or ADC). ADC fighter interceptor units were initially realigned into a component called Air Defense, Tactical Air Command (ADTAC), at the level of an Air Division. In 1985, First Air Force (1 AF) was reactivated by TAC and given the mission to provide, train and equip ADTAC combat ready forces. Upon its reactivation, First Air Force was composed of units of both the active Air Force and the Air National Guard. In the years since its third activation, more of the responsibility for the defense of American air sovereignty was shifted to the Air National Guard. By the 1990s, 90 percent of the air defense mission was being handled by the Air National Guard. In October 1997, First Air Force became an Air National Guard numbered air force, charged with the air defense of the North American continent.

Instead of increasing the number of units, the National Guard Bureau authorized units to increase the number of aircraft assigned to them when the Air Force made those planes available. In 1982, the South Carolina Air National Guard&#x27;s 169th Tactical Fighter Group began receiving new General Dynamics F-16A Fighting Falcons. In Air Force-wide competitions, ANG units and individuals frequently placed high or won. This was due in no small part to the ANG units being manned by more senior pilots and weapon systems officers, most of whom had recent combat experience as prior active duty officers in the Regular Air Force and who continued to hone their skills in fighter aircraft while their active duty contemporaries had to leave the cockpit for career enhancing non-flying staff assignments. The 169th Tactical Fighter Group garnered top team honors in the Air Force&#x27;s worldwide gunnery contest, Gunsmoke &#x27;89. During the late 1980s, the Air National Guard&#x27;s F-106 Delta Darts, F-4 Phantom IIs and A-7D Corsair IIs were being replaced by F-15A and F-15B Eagles and F-16A and F-16B Fighting Falcons as more advanced models such as the F-15C/D and F-16C/D were brought into active service with the Regular Air Force.

===Post Cold War era===
The expiration of the Soviet Union, beginning with the fall of the Berlin Wall and Glasnost in 1989 and culminating in the USSR&#x27;s breakup into its republics in 1991, constituted a major upheaval that continued to influence global politics into the 21st century.

====Panama====
In December 1989 and January 1990, ANG volunteers participated in Operation Just Cause, the invasion of Panama, to secure the arrest of Panamanian dictator and accused drug lord, General Manuel Noriega. Air National Guard aircrews already deployed TDY to Howard AFB, Panama also participated in Just Cause. Volunteer C-130 crews completed 181 sorties moving 3,107 passengers and 551.3 tons of cargo. In addition, Air National Guard A-7 Corsair II attack jets from the South Dakota Air National Guard&#x27;s 114th Tactical Fighter Group and the Ohio Air National Guard&#x27;s 180th Tactical Fighter Group flew 34 combat missions in support of the invasion. However, the Air National Guard and the Total Force concept would be fully tested in the two major operations of the 1990s: Operation Desert Shield and the first Gulf War, Operation Desert Storm.

In August 1990, ANG F-15 and F-16 fighter units initiated similar rotational service for Operation Coronet Nighthawk, the successor to Operation Volant Oak, out of Howard Air Force Base, Panama. Those units monitored suspected airborne drug traffickers transiting Central America as well as the adjacent oceans. As the 1999 transfer of the Panama Canal to Panama approached, the Air National Guard began turning the operation over to civilian contractors. The last air national guardsmen completed their deployments to these South American sites in 1999.

====Persian Gulf crisis====

Following the seizure of Kuwait by Iraqi forces in August 1990, the Air Force turned to both of its reserve components for help and was swamped with volunteers. Before President George H. W. Bush mobilized reservists and national guardsmen on 22 August 1990, nearly 1,300 air national guardsmen actually entered active duty as volunteers. Initially, most of them concentrated on aerial refueling and airlifting American forces to the Persian Gulf region. The first two ANG units to volunteer before the President&#x27;s mobilization order were the 105th Military Airlift Group of the New York Air National Guard, and the 172nd Military Airlift Group of the Mississippi Air National Guard. Respectively, they flew the C-5A Galaxy and the C-141B Starlifter.

Altogether, 12,456 air national guardsmen participated in Air Force operations during the Persian Gulf crisis/first Gulf War. When called upon, air national guardsmen were immediately prepared to perform their missions alongside their active Air Force counterparts. They did not need additional training or new equipment to do their jobs. They were integrated into most of the Air Force&#x27;s operational missions, flying strategic airlift and aerial refueling sorties, and manning aerial ports. Air national guardsmen also flew fighter, attack, aerial reconnaissance, special operations, and tactical theater airlift missions.

Compared to previous mobilizations, ANG units and individuals during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm were much better prepared to perform their missions upon entry into federal service. Units were well equipped and well trained. As planned, they were able to respond much more rapidly and effectively than in previous call-ups. They were integrated into operations with their active duty and Air Force Reserve counterparts with a minimum of disruption and delay.

In a new concept at the time, relatively few ANG outfits were mobilized as units. Instead, the Air Force called up packages of equipment and personnel that were developed after the crisis began. Mobilizing entire flying units and maintaining their integrity while in federal service, although desirable, would no longer be the only acceptable approach to supporting the Air Force in a crisis. Instead the Air National Guard would be flexible in its response in order to fit the situation. That could involve individual volunteers, tailored packages of volunteers, or mobilized air national guardsmen developed in response to specific contingencies.

After the first Gulf War ended in 1991, air power continued to play a significant role in containing Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime in Iraq, as did a naval blockade and United Nations economic sanctions. Together those forces also crippled the economic and military foundations of Hussein&#x27;s power. The Air National Guard participated widely in that long campaign, which featured U.S. and Coalition aircraft maintaining two no-fly zones over portions of Iraq: Operation Southern Watch (OSW) and Operation Northern Watch (ONW). In addition, ANG units provided humanitarian aid to the Kurdish population in northern Iraq. Later deploying units to Turkey participated in Operation Northern Watch that was focused strictly on enforcing the no-fly zone above the 36th parallel in Iraq as mandated by the UN and did not include humanitarian relief for the Kurds.

====Front-line aircraft====
Following the first Gulf War, the Air National Guard&#x27;s senior leadership in the National Guard Bureau began to adapt their organization for the post-Cold War era in a series of far-reaching discussions with top echelon Air Force personnel, state officials, unit leaders, and members of Congress. Essentially, the Air Force agreed it would attempt to retain all ANG and Air Force Reserve flying units, while reducing its own as a cost-effective way to maintain a post-Cold War force structure. However, as limited amounts of newer equipment became available from a smaller Air Force, and budgets tightened, the ANG would reduce the numbers of aircraft assigned to each unit. If necessary, it would combine units at the same locations. Some organizations would close down, but only as a last resort.
Aided by the newer aircraft from the shrinking Air Force inventory, the Air National Guard modernized and reshaped its fleet after the Cold War. The size and composition of the ANG&#x27;s aircraft inventory changed significantly after 1991. From 1991 to 2001 the ANG experienced an enormous growth in large aircraft including C-130H Hercules tactical airlifters, upgraded KC-135E and KC-135R Stratotankers, and B-1B Lancer strategic bombers at the expense of smaller fighter planes. One of the most critical modernization challenges facing the ANG involved its extensive fleet of older model F-16As and F-16Bs. As its goal, the ANG sought to acquire F-16C Block 25/30/32 aircraft, enabling ANG fighter units to have around-the-clock, all-weather, precision strike capabilities against surface targets. The first F-16As and F-16Bs to be retired from service entered storage with AMARC at Davis-Monthan AFB during 1993, with three aircraft from the 138th Fighter Squadron of the New York Air National Guard, followed by 17 examples from the 160th Fighter Squadron of the Alabama Air National Guard, which were updated with F-16Cs and F-16Ds from the shrinking active duty force.

In the general military drawdown following the end of the Cold War, many European-based F-15C Eagles previously assigned to USAFE were also transferred stateside. The 101st Fighter Squadron of the Massachusetts Air National Guard received new F-15Cs that were previously with the 32nd Fighter Group, Soesterberg AB, Netherlands in 1994. Other F-15A / F-15B units were upgraded to the F-15C and F-15D as they became available during the mid-1990s.

In the early 1990s, with the disestablishment of Strategic Air Command (SAC), Tactical Air Command (TAC) and Military Airlift Command (MAC) and their replacement with Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Mobility Command (AMC), all Air National Guard units transitioned to the objective wing organization. Most flying unit designations were simplified to &quot;Airlift&quot; or &quot;Fighter&quot; or &quot;Air Refueling&quot; or &quot;Rescue&quot;, with flying squadrons being assigned to Operations Groups. Also, on 1 October 1994, in accordance with the USAF &quot;one base-one wing&quot; policy, all Air National Guard flying units previously designated as a &quot;group&quot; had their status changed to a &quot;wing&quot; no later than 1 October 1995. Additionally, ANG stations hosting flying units were re-designated as an &quot;Air National Guard Base&quot; if they were not collocated on an active duty installation.

====Balkans operations====
Other overseas operations during the 1990s took air national guardsmen to Somalia, the former Yugoslavia, Haiti, and Rwanda to augment the Air Force in a series of contingencies and humanitarian relief operations. Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units would generally assume responsibility for an operation for 30 to 90 days, and then rotate their personnel on 15- to 30-day tours to a given location until the commitment ended.

In July 1992, crews and C-130s from West Virginia&#x27;s 167th Airlift Group inaugurated ANG involvement in Operation Provide Promise by flying food and relief supplies from Rhein-Main AB, Germany to Sarajevo, Bosnia&#x27;s capital, which had a population of 380,000. That operation expanded significantly the following February to include airdrops of food and medicine to Muslim enclaves in eastern Bosnia blockaded by Bosnian Serbs. Altogether, personnel and C-130s from 12 ANG units participated in Provide Promise. During the operation, Air Force, ANG, and Air Force Reserve transports flew 4,533 sorties and delivered 62,802 metric tons of cargo. They performed airlift, airdrop, and medical evacuation missions. The Americans made a major contribution to the overall allied effort, which involved airmen from 21 nations. The humanitarian airlift operation accounted for about 95 percent of the aid delivered during the -year siege of Sarajevo.

On 2 April 1993, NATO troops from Great Britain, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Germany, and Italy as well as the United States launched Operation Deny Flight, a no-fly zone for Serbian aircraft over Bosnia-Herzegovina. It enforced a March 1993 UN Security Council Resolution passed to help prevent the war from spreading. The operation also provided close air support to UN Protection Force ground troops serving as peacekeepers, and airstrikes against Serb weapons threatening UN-designated safe areas in Bosnia. The first ANG fighter unit involved was the Connecticut Air National Guard&#x27;s A-10-equipped 103rd Fighter Group. Aircraft and personnel from the Maryland Air National Guard&#x27;s 175th Fighter Group and Michigan Air National Guard&#x27;s 110th Fighter Group joined the contingent from Connecticut. Along with unit personnel, the six Air National Guard and six Air Force Reserve A-10s returned to their home stations in mid-January 1994 after flying 520 sorties and accumulating over 1,400 hours of Deny Flight flying time. Air National Guard tanker support of Deny Flight began in June 1994 with the dispatch of 10 KC-135s and 18 aircrews from six units to Istres Air Base, France, and Pisa Airport, Italy. By the time Deny Flight ended on 20 December 1995, elements of seven Air Guard fighter and 11 air refueling units had participated in it.

Operation Deliberate Force, was initiated in August 1995 after the Bosnian Serb army shelled a Sarajevo marketplace killing 43 civilians and wounding 75 more. A contingent from the 104th Fighter Wing participated in the action. The intensity of the bombing stunned the Serbs. Coupled with victories of an American-trained Croatian-Muslim army in western Bosnia, that operation forced the Serbs to sue for peace. NATO halted the bombing on 14 September 1995, and ended Deliberate Force six days later.

The Air National Guard returned to the Balkans in the mid-1990s as part of the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia, Operation Joint Guard, and its successor, Operation Joint Forge. Volunteers from 13 Air National Guard airlift units provided 71 C-130s to Joint Forge. On average, ANG airlift deployment packages consisted of approximately 75 personnel and two C-130 aircraft. They were based at Ramstein AB, Germany, to provide the necessary airlift support for U.S. military forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina and other locations across Europe.

====Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) Concept====

In August 1998, the Air Force inaugurated a new concept. Based on experiences during the Persian Gulf War and numerous deployments to the Balkans and other contingency operations, it organized more than 2,000 aircraft, including those of Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard units, into 10 Air Expeditionary Forces (AEFs), later designated as the Aerospace Expeditionary Forces, and, in 2007, the Air Expeditionary Forces. AEFs would rotate in order to ease the strain of increased post-Cold War operations overseas. The AEF promised to spread the burden of deployments more widely among flying units, Active Duty, Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard. Moreover, the timing of rotations became more predictable. Greater predictability would enable Airmen, especially those in the Air Reserve Component, to better manage the competing demands of families, civilian careers, and military service. Air National Guard aviation units would be expected to deploy overseas once every 15 months while support units would do so at 30-month intervals. Driven by those requirements, Air National Guard planners in the National Guard Bureau began to &quot;reengineer&quot; ANG units to better participate in their expeditionary roles. The benefits of this concept became apparent in the events of the early 2000s.

===Global war on terrorism===

====11 September 2001====
The defining events for the Air National Guard (ANG) as well as for the United States occurred with the al Qaeda attacks of 11 September 2001 on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. The only air defense fighter units stationed within the entire northeastern United States belonged to the Air National Guard.

At 8:38 am, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in Boston, Massachusetts, reported a possible hijacking and called the Otis Air National Guard Base control tower on Cape Cod, home to the Massachusetts ANG&#x27;s 102nd Fighter Wing, to request military assistance. At that time, Major Dan Nash and Lieutenant Colonel Tim Duffy had air defense alert duty for the 102nd. At 8:40 am Colonel Bob Marr, a Massachusetts air national guardsman serving as NORAD&#x27;s Northeast Air Defense Sector commander, learned from the FAA that American Airlines Flight 11 might have been hijacked. The two pilots immediately suited up and headed for their F-15s. Marr ordered Nash and Duffy into the air; their F-15s were airborne within six minutes and as directed, headed for New York City, 153 miles away. Unknown to the pilots, American Airlines Flight 11 had crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City just as Colonel Marr was delivering his order. Meanwhile, at 8:43 am, the FAA reported another possible hijacking to the Northeast Air Defense Sector. That was Boston to Los Angeles United Airlines Flight 175. At 9:02 am, with the F-15s still 71 miles away, that plane crashed into the World Trade Center&#x27;s South Tower.

At 9:09 am the pilots of the North Dakota Air National Guards F-16s of the 119th Fighter Wing were standing by, ready to launch, at their forward alert operating location at Langley AFB, Virginia, located about 130 miles southeast of Washington, DC. They were at their battle stations because of a growing general concern about the situation that morning. Seven minutes later, the FAA reported that United Airlines Flight 93, outbound from Newark, New Jersey, to San Francisco, California, might also have been hijacked. The FAA notified the Northeast Air Defense Sector eight minutes later that American Flight 77, a flight from Dulles International Airport, Virginia, near Washington, DC, to Los Angeles, California, also appeared to be the victim of hijackers. At 9:24 am Colonel Marr ordered three F-16s (two alert aircraft and a spare) scrambled from Langley AFB to check out an unidentified intermittent aircraft track heading toward Washington DC. In six minutes, the Langley F-16s were airborne.

In accordance with established NORAD procedures, the F-16s were initially directed to head northeast to avoid some of the most heavily traveled commercial airline routes rather than to fly directly to the Washington, DC, area. Major Dean Eckmann and Major Brad Derrig, plus Captain Craig Borgstrom of the 119th Fighter Wing were directed to fly at maximum subsonic speed, 660 miles per hour. At about 40 miles away, they saw the billowing smoke of American Airlines Flight 77, which had crashed into the Pentagon at 9:43 am. As the North Dakota air guardsmen neared Washington, DC, Major Eckmann, the flight lead, set up a patrol over the nation&#x27;s capital with the help of air traffic controllers at the Northeast Air Defense Sector.

On 22 May 2002, a Joint Resolution was passed by the Congress of the United States recognizing the members of the 102nd Fighter Wing for their actions on 11 September 2001. The resolution in part states:

Whereas on the morning of 11 September 2001, the 102nd Fighter Wing of the Massachusetts Air National Guard became the Nation&#x27;s first airborne responder to the terrorist attacks of that day when it scrambled two F-15 fighter aircraft just six minutes after being informed of the terrorist hijackings of commercial airliners.

====Operation Noble Eagle====
As a result of the September 11 attacks in 2001, homeland defense became the top national defense priority the enhanced defense of North America and military support to civilian government agencies, known as Operation Noble Eagle, began early the next day.

During the first 24 hours of the crisis, 34 Air National Guard fighter units flew 179 missions. Eighteen tanker units generated 78 aircraft in the same time period. Through 28 September, for example, the Alabama Air National Guard&#x27;s 117th Air Refueling Wing kept aircraft aloft on a continuous basis. Air National Guard units also contributed 111 C-130 aircraft for movement of personnel and equipment to needed locations, and more than 3,000 ANG security forces personnel supported the mission, augmenting civilian security police as necessary. A week after the attacks, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced the call up of over more than 5,000 members of the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve to support the nation&#x27;s increased security requirements. On 22 September, President George W. Bush mobilized about 5,100 more members of the air reserve components, including approximately 3,000 air refueling and about 130 security specialists.

Guardsmen gained national visibility starting 27 September when President George W. Bush asked the governors for their temporary help at commercial airports, which had reopened a few days after 9/11 with new security restrictions. In the airports they would &quot;Temporarily augment the civilian airport security function of the nation&#x27;s commercial airports with a trained, armed, and highly visible military presence.&quot; For more than seven months, several thousand guardsmen performed those security duties, with additional guardsmen called into service during the Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year holiday period. Although the Army Guard provided the vast majority of the enhanced airport security force, several hundred Air National Guard personnel also participated.

Combat Air Patrols (CAPs) began to be flown 24/7 over major cities in the United States. ANG squadrons at 26 bases were put at tremendous strain to support the operations. The Air National Guard ran continuous round-the-clock combat air patrols over New York City and Washington, D.C., until spring 2002. In addition, when key events occurred such as the 2002 Winter Olympics in Utah, Space Shuttle launches in Florida, baseball&#x27;s World Series and football&#x27;s Super Bowl, similar air patrols helped provide security. The Air National Guard also flew random patrols over various urban areas; nuclear power plants; major military installations such as MacDill AFB, Florida, Peterson AFB, Colorado, Offutt AFB, Nebraska and Scott AFB, Illinois that were home to various combatant command headquarters; weapons storage facilities and laboratories. Because estimates of the nation&#x27;s security situation became more optimistic, in spring 2002, the Air Force eliminated the continuous patrols and substituted random ones by the summer.

====Operation Enduring Freedom====

On 20 September 2001, President Bush told a televised joint session of Congress and the American people that Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda network were responsible for the recent terrorist attacks on the United States. The refusal of the Taliban to comply resulted in the United States taking military action to achieve the president&#x27;s demands, the action given the name Operation Enduring Freedom.

The ANG was involved even before the fighting in Afghanistan began. With the war imminent, the Air Force quickly established an airlift operations plan that included active duty, Guard, and Reserve components. It became one of the most extensive operations in Air Force history. Furthermore, the Air Force met the logistical needs of that operation despite the severe shortage of strategic airlift and troublesome maintenance needs of the older planes.

Shortly after the terrorist attacks on 9/11 and weeks before the first U.S. bomb was dropped over Afghanistan, the Air Force established air bridges to help funnel material and personnel overseas to support multiple operations in conjunction with Enduring Freedom. Air National Guard tanker units received orders by 20 September 2001, to be in their deployed locations before the start of their air bridge operations. Some ANG tanker units also flew humanitarian support missions. By using European bases, the Air Force could transfer cargo from the larger aircraft to smaller planes, refuel aircraft on the ground, exchange flight crews, give crews rest opportunities, and repair broken aircraft.

The Air National Guard contributed two C-141 Starlifter units, the 155th Airlift Squadron / 164th Airlift Wing, Tennessee Air National Guard; and the 183rd Airlift Squadron / 172nd Airlift Wing, Mississippi Air National Guard, to the strategic airlift mission. The Air National Guard&#x27;s sole C-5 Galaxy unit, the 137th Airlift Squadron / 105th Airlift Wing, New York Air National Guard at Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh, New York, also contributed to the operation. Through the ANG&#x27;s airlift participation in Europe, the Regular Air Force and Air Force Reserve (Associate) C-17 Globemaster IIIs could support Enduring Freedom directly.

When the war began, only Air National Guard units assigned to Air Force Special Operations Command deployed directly to Afghanistan to support combat operations. Typically, ANG special operations units in 13-man teams first went to active duty bases in the United States, and later to overseas locations.

The 169th Fighter Wing, South Carolina Air National Guard, was the first ANG fighter unit to deploy to Southwest Asia in direct support of the air war over Afghanistan. It sent over 200 personnel and six F-16CJs in January 2002 to Al Udeid Air Base in Doha, Qatar, to assist air combat operations over Afghanistan. In particular, they provided Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) against Taliban and al Qaeda positions, the only Air Force fighter unit in the theater to do so. F-16s sometimes were also configured for Cluster Bomb Units (CBUw). In addition, F-16 pilots sometimes fired their 20mm gun against ground targets. Missions could last up to 10 hours with multiple air refuelings. After so many hours strapped in their seats, pilots generally received one to three days of crew rest. The unit returned to South Carolina on 3 April 2002.

The Pennsylvania Air National Guard&#x27;s 103rd Fighter Squadron of the 111th Fighter Wing, became the first A-10 ANG unit to deploy directly to Afghanistan. From December 2002 to January 2003, the 111th Fighter Wing deployed personnel and sent its aircraft to Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan to carry out ground support missions for both United States as well as Afghan Northern Alliance ground forces. In March 2003, the 104th Fighter Squadron of Maryland&#x27;s 175th Wing deployed to Afghanistan. While there, it flew all the A-10 combat missions for Operation Enduring Freedom.

=====Takur Ghar=====
For Operation Anaconda, its commander, Army Major General Franklin L. Hagenbeck, directed coalition forces, U.S. soldiers and Afghan forces, to destroy remaining al Qaeda and Taliban forces in an area located roughly 65 nautical miles south of the Afghan capital, Kabul. One reconnaissance team in two helicopters landed on Takur Ghar, Ghar, a snowcapped, 10,200-foot mountain where temperatures at the top reached during the day and dropped to a negative five at night.

One helicopter carried a Navy SEAL team and an Air Force combat controller, Technical Sergeant John Chapman. As the SEAL team disem-barked, automatic weapons fire laced the helicopter&#x27;s side while a rocket propelled grenade ripped into it. The crew chief yelled, &quot;We&#x27;re taking fire! Go! Go! Go!&quot; and the SEAL team rushed back inside. As the pilots added power to evade the heavy ground fire, the damaged helicopter bucked violently, causing Navy SEAL Petty Officer 1st Class Neil Roberts, who was standing on the ramp, to fall about 12 feet to the ground below. The helicopter escaped the ambush and crash-landed about seven kilometers north of where Petty Officer Roberts fell. The second helicopter rescued the other SEALs and Sergeant Chapman but after returning to their base, they decided to try and rescue Petty Officer Roberts.

Regardless of the danger they knew the al Qaeda would treat Roberts badly and time was running out for him. Despite intense ground fire, the six men successfully returned to Takur Ghar. Nevertheless, the battle continued and Sergeant Chapman was killed along with several enemy fighters. Surrounded by gunfire, the men on the ground called upon a Quick Reaction Force (QRF), designed for such emergencies. Those forces consisted of 23 men and two helicopters. The team included Tech Sergeant Miller. &quot;We were notified that we would be launching in 45 minutes,&quot; he recalled, &quot;and were going into [an al Qaeda and Taliban] infested area.&quot; Also on the team were Army Rangers. During Operation Enduring Freedom, Rangers and special operations formed the focal point of the U.S. ground campaign. Because of communications failures, the Quick Reaction Force landed in the same spot as the previous helicopters and, like them, was greeted with gunfire. Miller&#x27;s helicopter managed to land, and the QRF called in close air support. For the next five and a half hours, they battled with the enemy. Three Rangers died and others were wounded.

According to Sergeant Miller, &quot;We continued to treat the patients, continued moving ammunition and grenades to where they were needed. I grabbed a radio … and set up satellite communication and then returned to the rear.&quot; Tech Sergeant Miller and Senior Airman Jason Cunningham, like Miller, a pararescueman, worked hard to keep the patients from succumbing to hypothermia. They put them in the helicopter and removed its insulation and wrapped it around the wounded Rangers. In addition, they used the majority of the fluids available in the medical kits and anything else, including the heaters packed in their food rations. With the help of the additional Rangers and more air strikes, they took the hill, killing many al Qaeda combatants. They also recovered the bodies of Petty Officer Roberts and Sergeant Chapman.

Approximately 10 minutes after the Rangers took control of the hill, they began to receive more frequent enemy mortar and automatic weapons fire. Although combat air support prevailed, the enemy wounded an Army medic and fatally wounded Airman Cunningham. At that point the Quick Reaction Force had 11 wounded and seven dead. After 17 hours on the mountaintop, a nighttime rescue took place and the ordeal was over. Operation Anaconda continued for another 19 days.

By March 2002, ANG C-130 units had flown 55 percent of the missions for the Afghanistan war. The 193rd Special Operations Wing of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard, using the EC-130E Commando Solo aircraft, performed an unusual mission in Afghanistan: psychological operations (PSYOPS). Since 1968, the 193rd had been handling airborne psychological operations missions. The EC-130E acquired the mission name Commando Solo during the 1990s, when the aircraft was modified to handle color television operations. One of the first ANG flying units deployed to the area, the 193rd began transmitting by the end of October 2001. For almost six months the unit relayed broadcasts of Voice of America in the Dari and Pashtu languages and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in Uzbek, Tajik, and Persian. According to a White House spokesman, the Commando Solo missions gave the Afghan people &quot;full knowledge about what is happening in Afghanistan from a source other than a repressive Taliban regime.&quot; The 193rd remained in the region until ground psychological warfare operations stations were safely established.

Once the Iraq conflict began in March 2003, the military began to reduce its resources in Afghanistan. Yet the reliance on using the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units, aircraft and personnel there continues to the present supporting the combat operations under United States Air Forces Central (USAFCENT). Air national guardsmen and aircraft deploy to Afghanistan routinely as part of the Air Expeditionary Units at bases there.

====Operation Iraqi Freedom====
On 18 March 2003, the United States and coalition forces launched the invasion of Iraq in order to remove Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime from power, the invasion being designated Operation Iraqi Freedom. In addition to flying units, such as fighter, air refueling, airlift, special operations and rescue, the ANG also provided a robust force of over 3,530 additional personnel for the expeditionary combat support functions and many Air National Guard senior officers held command positions during the war.

=====Siege of the Haditha Dam=====

As operations began, Army Rangers embarked on a mission to protect the Haditha Dam from being destroyed by Iraqi forces. The Rangers expected the operation to last approximately 24 hours. Instead it took them more than 12 days. The dam is a critical source of water and electrical in western Iraq. If the Iraqis succeeded in blowing up the dam, the releasing waters would flood the down-river areas, causing a humanitarian and environmental disaster.

The Rangers expected the dam to be well defended. In preparation for the assault on the dam, fighters assigned to the 410th Air Expeditionary Wing (410 AEW) conducted preparatory air strikes against Iraqi forces in the dam&#x27;s vicinity. Air support for Special Forces in the battle came from various coalition aircraft including U.S. Army Special Operations Aviation units. However, that battle became one of the defining operations for the AEW, and in particular, Air National Guard pilots. The 410th was responsible for providing combat search and rescue capability for western and central Iraq. During the month-long air campaign over the western Iraqi desert, the A-10 and F-16 Air National Guard pilots assigned to the AEW were involved in countless missions supporting Special Forces teams in need of close air support. The highly experienced Air National Guard pilots assigned to the AEW, especially the A-10 pilots, helped ensure the successful employment of close air support for friendly forces fighting to retain the Haditha Dam.

AH-6 helicopters of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment and F-16s from the 410 AEW provided air cover as the Rangers took their convoy to Haditha. During the night of 1 April 2003, with support from the 410th, the Rangers seized the dam, a power station, and a transformer yard while facing light to moderate enemy resistance. Several Iraqis were killed and wounded; others, including 25 civilian workers, were taken prisoner. As daylight broke over the dam, the Rangers began taking increasing enemy fire from the south as well as coordinated attacks at both ends of the dam. Although the Rangers repelled the initial assault, Iraqi counterattacks continued with heavy mortar and artillery shells that rained down on the Rangers. Fortunately, the Rangers had ample air support from the 410th which attacked several mortar positions. Even without the protection of darkness, the Air National Guard A-10s attacked numerous enemy positions. At nightfall the Iraqis resumed their attacks against the Rangers, but once again close air supported the U.S. forces. A single bomb obliterated the attackers and shattered every window in the dam complex. Nevertheless, the siege continued for ten more days.

The Rangers on the dam were greatly outnumbered. Nevertheless, the combined efforts of a Forward Air Controller-qualified pilot (FAC), a combat search and rescue (CSAR) pilot, and observation posts manned by additional Rangers and Air Force enlisted terminal attack controllers (who cleared airborne weapons for release) ensured the Rangers on the dam would not be overrun. That operation reflected the typical attitude held by Air National Guard aviators, especially A-10 pilots, who believed that when ground troops needed help, the pilots would remain as long as possible to, &quot;...lay it on the line more and expose themselves more over the target area.&quot; Even when the Rangers were not taking enemy fire, the A-10s provided cover so the Rangers could catch a few hours of sleep. The 410th fighters also supplied air cover during medical evacuation missions for killed and wounded Rangers.

During the twelfth day of the siege, the outnumbered Rangers continued to face repeated attacks by the enemy force. The Air National Guard A-10 and F-16 pilots realized early in the battle that the close air support they provided was the vital element that kept the Iraqi forces at bay, a matter of life and death for the Rangers. In the end the coalition forces prevailed. Military experts believed that without the air support, especially the A-10s, the Rangers would not have won the battle. Not only did the coalition forces secure the Haditha Dam complex, but they seriously reduced the fighting effectiveness of the Iraqi Armored Task Force in the Haditha area.

=====Intelligence operations=====

Air National Guard intelligence personnel deployed overseas and supported the war effort in signals intelligence by flying Senior Scout missions and augmented RC-135V/W Rivet Joint ELINT crews to &quot;monitor the electronic activity of adversaries.&quot; Although their pilots sat at controls in the United States, Air National Guardsmen also &quot;flew&quot; RQ-4 Global Hawk and MQ-1 Predator unmanned aerial vehicle intelligence missions in Southwest Asia.

Operation Iraqi Freedom&#x27;s intelligence collection efforts were enhanced by the initial combat employment of the Air Force&#x27;s first and only &quot;blended&quot; wing: the newly formed 116th Air Control Wing, composed of both ANG and active duty Air Force personnel based in Robins AFB, Georgia. The wing deployed nine of its 11 assigned E-8 Joint STARS aircraft to the Iraqi Freedom theater as well as over 600 unit personnel including one-tenth of the aircrews. Air National Guardsmen composed about one-fourth of the Wing&#x27;s deployed personnel. Although the wing has since reverted to an all-ANG organization, it continues to be integral to operation of the E-8 Joint STARS weapon system.

The 193rd Special Operations Wing of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard deployed its EC-130 Commando Solo aircraft for a variety of PSYOPS support to coalition agencies in Iraq. Flying from March to June 2003, its missions apparently fulfilled their goals. According to an Iraqi prisoner of war and former mid-level intelligence officer, the population in southern Iraq considered the coalition radio broadcasts more truthful than state-owned media. The leaflets also had a significant impact on the morale of Iraqi military and prompted considerations to surrender. The Iraqis concluded that U.S. planes could as easily target them with bombs as leaflets if their intent was lethal.

=====Support operations=====
As in Afghanistan, the Air National Guard contributed significant airlift capability to Operation Iraqi Freedom. Thirteen of ANG&#x27;s 25 airlift units participated, including 72 of 124 Air Force C-130s. Among their missions, Air National Guard C-130 crews airlifted elements of the 82nd Airborne Division and the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Force. Those crews also flew one of the first day/night airlift missions into an Iraqi air base and delivered the first humanitarian supplies into Baghdad International Airport. During Operation Iraqi Freedom&#x27;s first six months, Air National Guard C-130 crews airlifted 22,000 tons of cargo, 47,000 passengers, and flew 8,600 sorties in 21,000 hours.

As essential to the war effort as were C-130s, A-10s, and piloted reconnaissance and surveillance aircraft, they could not have completed their missions efficiently without aerial refueling. During the war in Iraq, the Air Force deployed 200 tanker aircraft based at 15 locations. Air National Guard KC-135 tankers provided one-third of the Air Force refueling aircraft deployed for Operation Iraqi Freedom, and an additional 35 ANG tanker aircraft conducted air bridge operations.

The Air National Guard also deployed air traffic control personnel, maintainers, and airspace managers. Over 27 percent of the total Air Force civil engineering force in Iraq came from the ANG; other Air Guard engineers supported Iraqi Freedom while operating in several other countries.

The Iraqi conflict continued through 2011 and the Air National Guard continued its involvement. By 2004 nearly 40 percent of the total Air Force aircraft deployed for overseas operations were assigned to the Air National Guard. The ANG supported Air Expeditionary Force deployments to Iraq throughout the 2000s, until the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011.

===State and local government support===

====Natural disasters====
Traditionally, governors called out National Guard units when faced with natural but localized disasters such as blizzards, earthquakes, floods, and forest fires. The president could also federalize them in major disasters that threatened to overwhelm the resources of individual states or communities. According to the National Guard Bureau, &quot;The indigenous skills and capabilities National Guardsmen to respond to natural disasters are the same skills and capabilities that enable us to successfully respond to potential terrorist threats.&quot;

The Air National Guard&#x27;s main tool for fighting forest fires is the Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System (MAFFS), which has undergone several updates since its first use in September 1971 by the California Air National Guard&#x27;s then-146th Tactical Airlift Wing and the North Carolina Air National Guard&#x27;s then 145th Tactical Airlift Group. Housed in C-130s, MAFFS could disperse up to 27,000 pounds ... almost 3,000 gallons ... of commercial fire retardants or an equivalent amount of water. Newer aircraft like the C-130J carry the MAFFS II, which carry even more fire retardant, can disperse it more rapidly over a wider area, and is easier to recharge after a mission than its predecessor.

Blizzards also created the need for National Guard support. Often both Army National Guard and Air National Guard units assisted with health and welfare matters, conducted debris removal and power generation, and provided supply and transportation support in connection with snowstorms. For example, a Christmas-time 2006 blizzard at the airport hub of Denver International Airport closed that facility down for two days. Army and air national guardsmen took food and water to thousands of travelers trapped there. In the same storm, western Kansas received between 15 and 36 inches of snow with drifts as high as 13 feet. The Air National Guard not only assisted people, but also dropped bales of hay to feed stranded cattle.

====Hurricane Katrina====

On 29 August 2005, the largest natural disaster the Air National Guard faced in its then 58-year history began when Hurricane Katrina hit the United States Gulf Coast. The most severe damage came from a 30-plus-foot storm surge along the Mississippi coast and the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana and breaks in the levies along a canal in New Orleans. Several weeks later Hurricane Rita devastated portions of western Louisiana and eastern Texas, and then the less severe Hurricane Wilma damaged Florida.

By the time Katrina made landfall, the Air National Guard had mobilized 840 personnel in Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. Although the Air National Guard had a domestic mission to support local authorities in rescue and relief operations following a natural disaster, its utilization for such missions had been limited primarily to a select group of career fields such as civil engineers, medical personnel, and services. In response to Hurricane Katrina, ANG units in all 54 states and territories responded to the recovery efforts in the Gulf States, with the Mississippi Air National Guard&#x27;s Jackson Air National Guard Base serving as a hub and operating location for numerous active duty, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, Naval Reserve and Army National Guard aircraft. The ANG flew 73 percent of the airlift for the relief operations including its brand new C-130J and C-17 Globemaster III aircraft. In addition, ANG Combat Search and Rescue pararescuemen and Combat Controllers saved over 1,300 victims.

ANG personnel arrived on the Gulf Coast on 29 August, a few hours after the storm&#x27;s arrival. Personnel from the Florida Air National Guard&#x27;s 202nd RED HORSE Squadron of the 125th Fighter Wing were some of the first to enter the area. Seventy-three engineers from this unit worked in hard-hit Hancock County, Mississippi. Initially establishing a basecamp for other emergency personnel, the unit began repairs in Hancock County communities working nearly around-the-clock on multiple construction projects to restore power, clean and repair schools, and refurbish electrical supplies. As a Florida unit, the 202nd had worked many other hurricanes. However, Katrina&#x27;s devastation surpassed anything in their previous experience.

To support rescue and relief operations in New Orleans, the Air National Guard used Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans, in Belle Chasse, Louisiana, on the Mississippi River&#x27;s West Bank. Within five hours of its orders, the 136th Airlift Wing of the Texas Air National Guard deployed 41 Air National Guardsmen to Belle Chasse. Less than 24 hours later, a C-130H landed at the air station with members of the Louisiana Air National Guard&#x27;s 159th Fighter Wing. Soon more aircraft arrived, delivering troops and supplies for New Orleans; offloaded pallets were stacked 10 deep on the aircraft parking ramp. Instead of heading into the flooded city, the 136th team remained at Belle Chasse and, within 36 hours of arriving, it established a fully functioning Air Terminal Operations Center and was keeping pace with the demanding mission schedule. That Aerial Port team, augmented by U.S. Navy cargo handlers and members of the 133rd Aerial Port Squadron, 133rd Airlift Wing of the Minnesota Air National Guard, handled over 124 missions with 1.5 million pounds of cargo and 974 passengers in one day. As one of its most crucial tasks, the Texas squadron downloaded the German pump system used to drain the city of New Orleans because its own pumps were inundated. It also uploaded two KC-135s with 140 kennels filled with rescued dogs bound for adoption in Arizona.

===Operation Deep Freeze===

The Air National Guard also participates in noncombat support missions that sometimes take it beyond the U.S. boundaries. For example, in Operation Winter Freeze, from November 2004 through January 2005, nearly 250 Army and air national guardsmen provided assistance to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) along 295 miles of the United States-Canada border. That operation included military personnel from U.S. Northern Command&#x27;s Joint Task Force North who helped the Border Patrol to, &quot;...keep potential terrorists out of the country and to break up smuggling rings that try to get them in.&quot; [In order] to detect, deter, and monitor suspicious actions ... Air Guard crews flew twin-engine, C-26 airplanes out of Syracuse, New York&quot;

The New York Air National Guard&#x27;s 109th Airlift Wing operates ski-equipped LC-130 Hercules transports that fly into arctic regions. In 2006, two LC-130s closed the 2006 Operation Deep Freeze located at McMurdo Station near the South Pole. The mission ended because the temperature dropped to almost minus in three days. Since 1988, the squadron had provided the air supply bridge to McMurdo, landing with wheels on an ice runway near the station. However, as it got colder, the ski-equipped LC-130s landed on a snow-covered skiway on the Ross Ice Shelf a few miles from the station.

In the spring and summer, the 109th heads toward the North Pole where it supports the National Science Foundation and several other nations in Greenland and above the Arctic Circle.

===Leak of classified information===

In April 2023, Jack Teixeira, a 21-year-old member of the intelligence wing of the Massachusetts Air National Guard, was arrested for unauthorized removal and transmission of classified US intelligence related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The leaked documents, which first appeared in an online group linked to Teixeira, strained relations with American allies and exposed weaknesses in the Ukrainian military. The arrest was conducted by the FBI at Teixeira&#x27;s residence in North Dighton, Massachusetts. On December 11, 2023, the United States Air Force disciplined 15 other individuals connected to the investigation of airman Jack Teixera.

==Organization==

=== Leadership ===
This is a list of the senior leaders or Generals of the Air National Guard. The title has changed over time: The Assistant Chief, National Guard Bureau for Air; Chief, Air Force Division, National Guard Bureau; Director Air National Guard.

=== Title 32 and Title 10 structure ===
Established under Title 10 and Title 32 of the U.S. Code, the Air National Guard is part of the state National Guard and is divided up into units stationed in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia (D.C.), the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the two U.S. Territories.

ANG units typically operate under Title 32 USC. However, when operating under Title 10 USC all ANG units are operationally gained by an active-duty major command of the Air Force or the U.S. Space Force. ANG units of the Combat Air Forces (CAF) based in the Continental United States (CONUS), plus a single air control squadron of the Puerto Rico ANG, are gained by the Air Combat Command (ACC). CONUS-based ANG units in the Mobility Air Forces (MAF), plus the Puerto Rico ANG&#x27;s airlift wing and the Virgin Islands ANG&#x27;s civil engineering squadron are gained by the Air Mobility Command (AMC) The exception to this rule is the District of Columbia Air National Guard (DC ANG). As a federal district, the units of the DC ANG are under the direct jurisdiction of the President of the United States through the office of the Commanding General, District of Columbia National Guard.

In the &quot;state&quot; role, the Air National Guard may be &quot;called up&quot; for active duty by the governors to help respond to domestic emergencies and disasters, such as those caused by hurricanes, floods, fires, and earthquakes. In the case of the D.C. Air National Guard, the Adjutant General of the District of Columbia reports to the Mayor of the District of Columbia, who may only activate DC Air Guard and Army Guard assets for limited activation after consultation and approval of the President of the United States.

With the consent of the state governor, members or units of the Air National Guard may be appointed, temporarily or indefinitely, to be federally recognized members of the armed forces, in the active or inactive (e.g., reserve) service of the United States. If federally recognized, the member or unit becomes part of the Air National Guard of the United States, which is one of two reserve components of the U.S. Air Force, and part of the U.S. National Guard. Because both state and federal ANGs go relatively hand-in-hand, they are both usually referred to collectively.

Air National Guardsmen who become members of the Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) receive full active duty pay and benefits just like active duty members of any branch of the armed forces.

U.S. ANG units or members may be called up for federal active duty in times of Congressionally sanctioned war or national emergency. The President may also call up members and units of the Air National Guard using a process called &quot;federalization&quot;, with the consent of state governors or equivalents, to repel invasion, suppress rebellion, or execute federal laws if the U.S. or any of its states or territories are invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation, or if there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the federal government, or if the president is unable to execute the laws of the U.S. with the regular armed forces.

Many ANG pilots work for commercial airlines, but in the ANG they may train to fly any of the aircraft in the USAF inventory, with the current exception of the B-1B Lancer and B-52 Stratofortress bombers, E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft, KC-10 Extender and the AC-130 Gunship. The Georgia Air National Guard and the Kansas Air National Guard previously flew the B-1B Lancer prior to converting to the E-8 Joint STARS and KC-135R Stratotanker, respectively. In addition, the 131st Fighter Wing of the Missouri Air National Guard transitioned from flying the F-15C/D Eagle at St. Louis International Airport/Lambert Field Air National Guard Station to the B-2 Spirit at Whiteman Air Force Base as an &quot;Associate&quot; unit of the Regular Air Force&#x27;s 509th Bomb Wing and was re-designated as the 131st Bomb Wing.

In 2012, General Norton A. Schwartz, the then-Chief of Staff of the Air Force, defended cutting nearly twice as many service members from the Air National Guard and the AFRC as from the active duty Regular Air Force in order to maintain the service&#x27;s surge and rotational capabilities in the Active Component. These proposals were eventually overruled and cancelled by the U.S. Congress.

Air National Guard operations are arranged according to U.S. state structure, so that each of the fifty states and Washington, D.C. host at least one wing. Additionally, Guam, Puerto Rico and The US Virgin Islands each support a wing or support squadron. Some larger states such as California, Ohio, New York, and Texas host as many as five wings as well as smaller geographically separated units (GSUs). Air National Guard wings are either assigned aircraft or, in some cases, operate as &quot;non-flying&quot; wings. Examples of non-flying wings include regional support wings and intelligence wings. For the most part, the ANG &quot;own&quot; their own equipment, but in some cases, aircraft and mission support operations are shared with active-duty Air Force or the Air Force Reserve. ANG stations may be located on or next to active-duty Air Force bases, Air Reserve bases, civilian airports, Naval Air stations, Army installations, or stand-alone Air National Guard stations.

The majority of ANG wings fall under either ACC or AMC MAJCOMS. Some exceptions include the Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam wings, whose CAF and MAF units are operationally gained by Pacific Air Forces, and wings associated with U.S. Space Force, Air Education and Training Command, Air Force Global Strike Command, and Air Force Special Operations Command, and U.S. Air Forces in Europe – Air Forces Africa.

As of 30 September 2019, the U.S. Air National Guard has about 107,100 men and women in service. Like the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), most ANG members serve part-time at least one weekend a month and an additional two weeks a year (e.g., 38 days). However, the demands of maintaining aircraft mean that some AFRC and ANG members work full-time, either as full-time Air Reserve Technicians (ART) or Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) personnel. Even traditional part-time air guardsmen, especially pilots, navigators/combat systems officers, air battle managers and enlisted aircrew, often serve 100 or more man-days annually. The Air National Guard and the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) comprise the &quot;Air Reserve Component&quot; of the U.S. Air Force under the &quot;Total Force&quot; construct.

===Squadrons===

====Flying Squadrons====
==Chain of command==

As state militia units, the units in the Air National Guard are not in the normal U.S. Air Force chain of command. They are under the jurisdiction of the United States National Guard Bureau unless they are federalized by order of the President of the United States.

The Air National Guard Readiness Center, a field operating center of the U.S. Air Force at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, performs operational and technical functions to ensure combat readiness of ANG units and is a channel of communication between the Air Force and the National Guard Bureau regarding readiness and operations.

Air National Guard units are trained and equipped by the U.S. Air Force. The state (or equivalent) ANG units, depending on their mission, are operationally gained by a major command of the USAF if federalized. In addition, personnel and equipment are routinely federalized and deployed by the USAF as part of Air Expeditionary Forces.

==Personnel and culture==
ANG enlisted members complete Basic Military Training at Joint Base San Antonio. Air National Guard personnel are expected to adhere to the same moral and physical standards as their &quot;full-time&quot; active duty Air Force and &quot;part-time&quot; Air Force Reserve federal counterparts.

=== Awards and decorations ===
All Air National Guardsmen are eligible to receive all U.S. military awards. The ANG also bestows a number of state awards for local services rendered in a service member&#x27;s home state or equivalent.

<doc id="265577" wikidata="Q653236" url="?curid=265577" title="Alastair Campbell">
<text>Alastair John Campbell (born 25 May 1957) is a British journalist, author, strategist, broadcaster, and activist, who is known for his political roles during Tony Blair&#x27;s leadership of the Labour Party. Campbell worked as Blair&#x27;s spokesman and campaign director in opposition (1994–1997), then as Downing Street Press Secretary, and as the Prime Minister&#x27;s Official Spokesperson (1997–2000). He then became Downing Street&#x27;s director of communications and spokesman for the Labour Party (2000–2003).

Campbell was Political Editor at the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; newspaper in the 1980s and of &quot;Today&quot; in the 1990s. In 1994, shortly after Blair was elected as Leader of the Labour Party in 1994, Campbell left the &quot;Today&quot; newspaper to become Blair&#x27;s press secretary. He was one of several key people responsible for the rebranding of the Labour Party as New Labour before its victory in the 1997 general election. In addition to being the press spokesman, Campbell was Blair&#x27;s speechwriter and chief strategist, earning a reputation for ruthless news management. Campbell played an important role in the run-up to the 1997 general election, working with Peter Mandelson to co-ordinate Labour&#x27;s successful election campaign. 

When Labour won the general election in May 1997, Campbell served as Blair&#x27;s chief press secretary. He put Downing Street briefings on record for the first time, and although he was only identified as the Prime Minister&#x27;s Official Spokesman, he became one of the most high-profile and written-about figures in British politics, earning the epithet &quot;the real deputy Prime Minister&quot;. Campbell oversaw Blair&#x27;s successful 2001 general election campaign for re-election. In the run-up to the Iraq War, Campbell was involved in the preparation and release of the September Dossier in 2002 and the Iraq Dossier in 2003. Campbell was accused of influencing the reports against the wishes of the intelligence services, which led to Campbell battling with the BBC as well as the general media and later resigning. He returned to assist with the successful 2005 general election campaign. 

Since his work for Blair, Campbell has continued to act as a freelance advisor to a number of governments and political parties, including Edi Rama, the Prime Minister of Albania. He was an adviser to the People&#x27;s Vote campaign, campaigning for a public vote on the final Brexit deal. He is the editor-at-large of &quot;The New European&quot; and chief interviewer for &quot;GQ&quot;. He acts as a consultant strategist and as an ambassador for Time to Change and other mental health charities. Throughout his time in Downing Street, Campbell kept a diary which reportedly totalled some two million words. Selected extracts, titled &quot;The Blair Years&quot;, were published in 2007. He expressed an intention to publish the diaries in fuller form, which he did from 2010 to 2018. In 2019, Campbell was expelled from the Labour Party after voting for the Liberal Democrats in that month&#x27;s European elections. In 2022, Campbell launched the podcast &quot;The Rest Is Politics&quot; with Rory Stewart, which has been the top politics podcast in the UK in the Apple rankings since its launch.

==Education and early life==
Campbell was born on 25 May 1957 in Keighley, West Riding of Yorkshire, the son of Scottish veterinary surgeon Donald Campbell and his wife, Elizabeth ( Caldwell), who had moved to Keighley when his father became a partner in a local veterinary practice. Donald was a Gaelic-speaker from the island of Tiree; his wife was from Ayrshire. Campbell grew up with two older brothers, Donald and Graeme, and a younger sister, Elizabeth.

Campbell attended Bradford Grammar School for a short period of time, followed by City of Leicester Boys&#x27; Grammar School, and the University of Cambridge, where he was an undergraduate student of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He studied modern languages (French and German), gaining an upper second (2:1) degree.

==Journalism==
Following graduation from Cambridge, he joined the Mirror Group training scheme and spent a year at a local weekly paper. He became the sports editor at the &quot;Tavistock Times&quot;, writing a column called &#x27;Campbell&#x27;s Corner&#x27;. He published &quot;Inter-City Ditties&quot;, his winning entry to a readers&#x27; competition in &quot;Forum&quot;, the journalistic counterpart to &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine. This led to a lengthy stint writing pieces for the magazine. His first piece for mainstream news journalism was coverage of the Penlee lifeboat disaster in December 1981, while a trainee on the Plymouth-based &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;, then owned by Mirror Group. 

In 1982, Campbell moved to the London office of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, Fleet Street&#x27;s sole remaining big-circulation supporter of the Labour Party. He became a political correspondent, then in 1986 moved to &quot;Today&quot;, a full-colour tabloid newspaper, where he worked as a news editor. His rapid rise and its accompanying stress led to alcohol abuse. In 1986, while accompanying MP Neil Kinnock on a tour of Scotland, Campbell had a nervous breakdown. Campbell stayed in Ross Hall Hospital, a private BMI hospital in Glasgow. Over the next five days as an in-patient, he was given medication to calm him. After seeing a psychiatrist, he realised that he had an alcohol problem. Campbell said that from that day onwards he counted each day that he did not drink alcohol, and did not stop counting until he had reached thousands. He experienced a period of depression and he was reluctant to seek further medical help. He eventually cooperated with treatment from his family doctor.

Campbell returned to the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, where he eventually became political editor. He was a close adviser to MP Neil Kinnock, and &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; publisher Robert Maxwell. Shortly after Maxwell drowned in November 1991, Campbell punched &quot;The Guardian&quot; journalist Michael White after White joked about &quot;Captain Bob, Bob, Bob...bobbing&quot; in the Atlantic Ocean, referring to where the tycoon&#x27;s body had been recovered. Campbell later put this down to stress over uncertainty as to whether he and his colleagues would lose their jobs. After leaving the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; in 1993, Campbell became political editor of &quot;Today&quot;.

==Politics and government==
In 1994, shortly after Tony Blair was elected as Leader of the Labour Party in 1994, Campbell left the &quot;Today&quot; newspaper to become Blair&#x27;s press secretary. In his autobiography, Blair would later state that Campbell had coined the name &quot;New Labour&quot; and described Campbell as a &quot;genius&quot;. Campbell wrote the speech that led to the party&#x27;s review of Clause IV and the birth of &quot;New Labour&quot;. In addition to being the press spokesman, Campbell was Blair&#x27;s speechwriter and chief strategist, earning a reputation for ruthless news management. The Conservatives conceded they were partly defeated by their inability to find someone to match him. Campbell played an important role in the run-up to the 1997 UK general election, working with Peter Mandelson to co-ordinate Labour&#x27;s successful election campaign. He also worked hard to win support from the national media for the Labour Party, particularly from newspapers that for many years had been anti-Labour. By March 1997, many of the leading newspapers, including &quot;The Sun&quot;, once a staunch supporter of Margaret Thatcher, declared their support for Labour.

When Labour won the general election in May 1997, Campbell served as the Prime Minister Blair&#x27;s chief press secretary (1997–2000). He persuaded Cabinet Secretary Robin Butler that government communications had to be modernised, and the government set up the Mountfield Review. He created a Strategic Communications Unit which gave Downing Street the power to co-ordinate all government activity, using what became known as &quot;the grid&quot; as its main apparatus. He set up a rapid rebuttal unit similar to the one he had used in opposition. He put Downing Street briefings on record for the first time, and although he was only identified as &quot;The Prime Minister&#x27;s Official Spokesman&quot;, he became one of the most high-profile and written-about figures in British politics, earning the epithet &quot;the real deputy Prime Minister&quot;. He opened briefings to the foreign media, which were among a raft of modernisation and efficiency strategies he introduced. In 2001 Campbell claimed that the days of the &quot;bog standard&quot; comprehensive school were over, due to educational policies of the Labour government.

BBC documentary maker Michael Cockerell produced a full-length documentary about Campbell&#x27;s media operation, &quot;News From Number Ten&quot;. Campbell attacked the news media for their obsession with him, and eventually began to pull back from frontline work and delegated direct briefing of the media to others. He then moved to the post of Prime Minister&#x27;s Director of Communications.

Campbell was part of the core team that conducted the negotiations that led to the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, and he has been honoured by several Irish universities for his role in the peace process. He became a close friend of Martin McGuinness, and attended his funeral in 2017. McGuinness helped Campbell with a novel which had an Irish Republican Army (IRA) active service unit as part of the plot.

Campbell was seconded to overhaul the communications of NATO during the Kosovo War, when US President Bill Clinton feared NATO was losing the propaganda war against the Slobodan Milošević regime. The general in charge of the military operation, Wesley Clark, credited Campbell with bringing order and discipline to NATO communications, and freeing the military to do its job.

Campbell became a central figure in the handling of the aftermath of Diana, Princess of Wales&#x27;s death after the head of the royal household, the Earl of Airlie, asked Tony Blair to second Campbell to help prepare the funeral, saying they knew it would have to be different. Campbell is widely reported to have coined the phrase &quot;the people&#x27;s princess&quot; and to have persuaded the queen to make her broadcast to the nation more personal, not least by using the phrase &quot;speaking as a grandmother&quot;. 

Campbell oversaw Blair&#x27;s successful 2001 UK general election campaign for re-election and also returned to assist with the successful 2005 UK general election campaign.

===Iraq War===
In the run-up to the Iraq War, Campbell was involved in the preparation and release of the &quot;September Dossier&quot; in 2002 and the &quot;Iraq Dossier&quot; in February 2003. These documents argued the case for concern over weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Both have been criticised as overstating or distorting the actual intelligence findings. Subsequent investigations revealed that the &quot;September Dossier&quot; had been altered at Campbell&#x27;s suggestion to be consistent with a 12 September 2002 speech given by President George W. Bush and statements by other United States officials. On 9 September 2002, Campbell sent a memo to Sir John Scarlett, the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee, in which Campbell directed that the British dossier be &quot;one that complements rather than conflicts with&quot; the US claims.

On 29 May 2003, Andrew Gilligan of the BBC first alleged Campbell to have influenced the reports against the wishes of the intelligence services, misrepresenting his source, Dr David Kelly, in the process. This led to Campbell battling with the BBC as well as the general media. 

A Channel 4 interview &quot;The Guardian&quot; called &#x27;infamous&#x27; even 20 years later, and forcefully written diary entries made public in the Hutton Inquiry into the death of David Kelly saw the resignation of Campbell during the inquiry, then, upon publication of its findings, the resignation of both the Chair of the BBC Gavyn Davies as well as its Director-General Greg Dyke and, eventually, the resignation of Andrew Gilligan himself. The BBC&#x27;s online history of itself describes it as &quot;one of the most damaging episodes in the BBC&#x27;s history&quot;. After his resignation, a complete overhaul of the Prime Minister&#x27;s press office was suggested in internal government documents, as the press office was seen as to have &quot;lost all credibility as a reliable, truthful, objective operation&quot;. 

Neither a parliamentary investigation (2003) led by Lord Hutton, nor a private review (2004) of the intelligence services by Lord Butler found cases of wrongdoing on Campbell&#x27;s behalf. (Though the opposite case continued to be made in the media. Also, with conviction, by Dyke and Gilligan.) Neither did the Chilcot Inquiry of 2016, which was much more critical of the government than previous investigations.

Another view has been offered by Biljiana Scott, as early as 2004. She suggested that an accessible explanation for the incident can be found by examining the parties&#x27; differing professional cultures. Kelly sought to communicate scientific truth, Gilligan sought to communicate the government&#x27;s lacking argument, and Campbell sought to communicate the case for war in the most convincing way available. Later in 2003, commenting on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, Campbell said, &quot;Come on, you don&#x27;t seriously think we won&#x27;t find anything?&quot;. Even years later he was genuinely convinced of there being a case for war.

In 2013, in a speech Campbell gave in Australia, he argued that there had always been &quot;spin&quot; and propaganda, but that there was more pressure to tell the truth &#x27;today&#x27; than there was during the second world war. He went on to claim that Tony Blair had &quot;greater commitment to wartime truth than Winston Churchill&quot;.

==Later career==
Campbell worked again for the Labour Party as Campaign Director in the run-up to their third consecutive victory at the 2005 general election. Campbell also acted as an adviser to Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband at the 2010 and the 2015 general elections. Sir Clive Woodward recruited Campbell to manage relations with the press for the British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand in 2005. Campbell wrote a column for &quot;The Times&quot; during the tour. 

Throughout his time in Downing Street, Campbell kept a diary which reportedly totaled some 2 million words. Selected extracts, titled &quot;The Blair Years&quot;, were published on 9 July 2007. Subsequent press coverage of the book&#x27;s release included coverage of what Campbell had chosen to leave out, particularly in respect of the relationship between Blair and his chancellor and successor Gordon Brown. Campbell expressed an intention to one day publish the diaries in fuller form, and indicated in the introduction to the book that he did not wish to make matters harder for Brown in his new role as Prime Minister, or to damage the Labour Party. Campbell released the diaries in fuller form from 2010 to 2018.

In 2003 and 2004, Campbell wrote a series for &quot;The Times&quot; newspapers, analysing greatness in sports to answer the question &quot;Who is the greatest sports star of all time?&quot; Although his conclusion was Muhammad Ali, as part of the process, he interviewed and profiled sports stars from around the world, including Ian Botham, Nick Faldo, Ben Ainslie, Michael Phelps, Martina Navratilova, Shane Warne, Alex Ferguson, Bobby Charlton and Lance Armstrong. Campbell later said that he &quot;fell hook, line and sinker&quot; for the Armstrong legend. He subsequently worked with Armstrong, campaigning for cancer charities, but drew criticism from Armstrong&#x27;s nemesis David Walsh for being so supportive and defending him so passionately. Campbell later acknowledged Walsh had been right. 

Campbell has his own website and blog, as well as several pages on other social media websites. He uses these platforms to discuss British politics and other topics close to his heart. So far, Campbell&#x27;s commentaries and views have garnered media attention and generated interest among various online communities. In October 2008, he broadcast the personal story of his mental illness in a television documentary partly to reduce the stigma of that illness. He has written a novel on the subject entitled &quot;All in the Mind&quot;.

Campbell made his first appearance on the BBC One political discussion programme &quot;Question Time&quot; on 27 May 2010. At the opening of the edition, presenter David Dimbleby said that the new Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition would not allow a frontbench member of the government to appear on the show unless Campbell was dropped. The BBC refused to do this. The government later accused the BBC of behaving improperly for allowing Campbell to appear as a more in-depth version of his diaries was due to be published the following week, and a Downing Street spokesman told &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Campbell seemed to be on because he&#x27;s flogging a book next week, so the BBC haven&#x27;t behaved entirely properly here.&quot; Campbell said that he had waited until Labour were in opposition before appearing on the show and that the date was a coincidence as it was the only time he was free. He suggested the discord was part of a Conservative anti-BBC agenda. The minister who had been scheduled to appear was the then Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Laws, who Campbell produced a picture of during the programme. Three days later, Laws resigned from his post following revelations about possible irregularities in his expenses claims in &quot;The Telegraph&quot; the day before.

In 2011, Campbell contacted the Metropolitan Police with suspicions that his phone was hacked by the &quot;News of the World&quot; in 2003. He received damages, part of which he used to sponsor the Burnley women&#x27;s football team.

In May 2012, Campbell took a role at PR agency Portland Communications, at the invitation of Tim Allan, a former adviser to Tony Blair. Along with Blair, Campbell has also provided consultancy services to the government of Kazakhstan on &quot;questions of social economic modernisation.&quot;

=== Return to journalism ===

In January 2014, Campbell announced that he was joining &quot;British GQ&quot;, with a brief to conduct interviews with figures from &quot;politics... sport, business, culture, (and) other aspects of life that I find interesting&quot;, succeeding Piers Morgan. In his role at &quot;GQ&quot; Campbell has interviewed a wide range of public figures, including José Mourinho, Raheem Sterling, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Mario Balotelli, Mo Farah and Usain Bolt from the world of sport and Tony Blair, Sadiq Khan, Nicola Sturgeon, George Osborne, John McDonnell, John Bercow, and Chuka Umunna from the world of politics. Campbell has also conducted in-depth interviews with many other figures from public life, including Archbishop Justin Welby, Garry Kasparov and Rachel Riley. In 2017, Campbell conducted an interview with Prince William. In March 2017, &quot;GQ&quot; began to film the interviews to use as part of their digital platform, beginning with an interview with Owen Jones, and then Tony Blair. When Jeremy Corbyn was interviewed for the magazine in late 2017, he did so on the condition that Campbell would not be the interviewer.

In May 2016, the &quot;International Business Times&quot; announced that Campbell had joined it as a columnist.

In March 2017, the newspaper &quot;The New European&quot; announced that it had appointed Campbell as editor-at-large.

In May 2019, Campbell announced that he and his daughter Grace, a comedian and feminist, had launched a joint podcast, &quot;Football, Feminism and Everything In Between&quot;: a series of interviews with figures from politics, sport and other walks of life. Their first interview was with Ed Miliband, followed by Rachel Riley, Jamie Carragher, Kelly Holmes and Maro Itoje.

When Government Adviser Dominic Cummings broke government guidelines to visit Durham, England, Campbell urged his social media followers to write to all Conservative MPs asking for their view and published a 50,000-word analysis of what he called &#x27;Organised Hypocrisy&#x27; on his website, based on the responses he collated.

Campbell was a guest presenter of &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; from 10 to 12 May 2021, co-hosting with Susanna Reid.

In January 2022, Campbell began a series of interviews for &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; called &quot;Talking Heads&quot;, with a focus on mindset and well-being. This began with England rugby player Maro Itoje and former athlete turned sports politician Sebastian Coe.

In March 2022, Campbell launched &quot;The Rest Is Politics&quot; podcast with Rory Stewart, a former Conservative Member of Parliament and a candidate in the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election. The pair discuss current news stories and reminisce about their old jobs.

In May 2023, Campbell published his eighteenth book, &quot;But What Can I Do?&quot;, a call to arms to people to get more engaged in politics. He provides an analysis of what he refers to as &quot;populism, polarisation and post-truth politics&quot;. The book went to No 1 in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; bestseller list in the first week of publication, meaning Campbell had both the most popular podcast (&quot;The Rest Is Politics&quot;) and the best-selling non-fiction hardback book in the UK at the same time.

Campbell launched a regular series of &#x27;Instagram live&#x27; broadcasts, in which he vented his criticisms of Boris Johnson. Campbell was a critic of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, and the British government&#x27;s tolerance of oligarchs close to Vladimir Putin, contrasting it with their &#x27;cruel and shabby&#x27; treatment of Ukrainian refugees, who faced large amounts of red tape before being considered for exile. He wrote extensively on his meetings with the Russian president alongside Tony Blair.

=== People&#x27;s Vote campaign ===

Immediately after the UK&#x27;s referendum on membership of the European Union in June 2016, Campbell stated that he thought it was &quot;the worst decision Britain had made in his lifetime&quot; and would do what he could to change people&#x27;s minds. In addition to establishing &quot;The New European&quot;, he was one of the early movers in the People&#x27;s Vote campaign for a referendum on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations.

In 2018 Campbell became part of the top table team at the People&#x27;s Vote campaign fighting for a referendum on the Brexit deal. This included overseeing the production of campaign films, including one written by and starring his daughter Grace, called The Brexit Special, for which Campbell persuaded actor Richard Wilson to revive his most famous character, Victor Meldrew.

In 2018 Campbell worked for the People&#x27;s Vote campaign&#x27;s planning and organisation of a march on Parliament on 20 October, which drew an estimated 250,000 people onto the streets. The march was described by the media as the second biggest ever, after the protest against the Iraq war in 2003.

Campbell helped organize and spoke at a second march and rally attended by an estimated million people in October 2019, on the day that Boris Johnson called a rare Saturday sitting in Parliament to back his Brexit deal.

In July 2017, Campbell was invited to speak at the French National Assembly to the newly elected MPs of President Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s victorious En Marche party. This was after Campbell had met and advised Macron during the campaign. He urged the French to be patient with the United Kingdom and to give them a chance to change course and reverse Brexit. He said Macron had been bolder than Tony Blair in setting up a new party and leading it to power within little over a year.

Campbell wrote a piece criticising the chairman of Open Britain, Roland Rudd, after Rudd unilaterally decided to sack two key campaign officials ahead of the 2019 UK general election.

=== Mental health activism ===
Campbell&#x27;s experience with depression was recalled in a BBC documentary titled &quot;Cracking Up&quot;. He has since then been a prominent supporter and advocate for the mental health anti-stigma campaign Time to Change. In November 2017, he was made an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in recognition of his work in breaking down the stigma surrounding mental illness and promoting the importance of psychiatry.

Campbell took part in the Mental Health Foundation&#x27;s takeover of Channel 4 for Mental Health Awareness Week 2017, acting as a celebrity continuity announcer. For the Mental Health Awareness Week two years later he broadcast the documentary &quot;Alastair Campbell: Depression and Me&quot;, exploring different ways of dealing and coping with depression. It was part of a BBC series drawing attention to different mental health conditions.

In 2019, Campbell was appointed global ambassador to Australians for Mental Health, a new umbrella organisation fighting for better services. He made numerous media appearances and caused controversy by saying on the Australian version of &quot;Question Time&quot;, that Donald Trump and fellow populists were &quot;sowing the seeds of fascism&quot;.

=== Expulsion from Labour Party ===
On 28 May 2019, Campbell announced that he had been expelled from the Labour Party after voting for the Liberal Democrats in that month&#x27;s European elections, and that he would appeal against the decision. He also questioned the speed of his expulsion compared to the treatment of Labour colleagues accused of anti-semitism. In response, shadow minister Dawn Butler stated that it was common knowledge that voting for another party would result in automatic exclusion.

Campbell was a long-standing critic of Labour&#x27;s Brexit strategy and in the May 2019 European elections, he voted for the Liberal Democrats as a protest vote. He announced this after the polls had closed in interviews on TV and radio covering the results as they came in. He said he did so, in common with many others, to persuade Labour unequivocally to back a People&#x27;s Vote. Two days later, by email, he was expelled from the Party, a move which provoked a major media storm in which many other Labour members outed themselves as having voted for parties other than Labour, including Cherie Blair, Charles Clarke, Bob Ainsworth and Betty Boothroyd. A hashtag #ExpelMeToo trended on Twitter as ordinary members expressed their support for Campbell. He immediately appealed the decision, saying tactical voting was not a breach of the rule under which he had been expelled, and arguing that unless all others who had acted as he did were expelled he also had a case for discrimination. Labour deputy leader Tom Watson condemned the expulsion as &quot;spiteful&quot; and a number of senior MPs immediately called for the decision to be reversed, and an amnesty of all who voted against Labour in the European elections.

In July 2019, in the week Boris Johnson became prime minister, Campbell penned a 3,500-word open letter to Jeremy Corbyn saying he no longer wished to be re-admitted to the party despite legal advice saying he would win a court case against his expulsion. He called on Corbyn to step down and cited his &quot;failure&quot; on Brexit, antisemitism, broader policy and &quot;above all the failure to develop and execute a strategy&quot;. The story was broken in &quot;The Guardian&quot; and the full letter published in &quot;The New European&quot;. Corbyn said he was &quot;disappointed&quot;, prompting Campbell to ask why he had been expelled.

Campbell voted Labour in the 2019 general election, having been part of a failed tactical voting campaign aimed at preventing Johnson from winning a majority. Labour were returned to government in the 2024 general election, under the leadership of Keir Starmer. Campbell and Stewart did the election night coverage on Channel 4.

== Personal life ==
Campbell entered into a civil partnership with British journalist Fiona Millar, on 30 March 2021, after being together for 42 years. The couple have two sons and a daughter, the comedian Grace Campbell. 
In early 2025, news outlets reported that Alastair Campbell’s son, Rory Campbell, was facing legal action over a failed football betting syndicate. Allegedly involving around 50 investors—including Alastair Campbell and his wife, Fiona—the syndicate was said to have incurred losses of up to £5 million. 

Campbell&#x27;s nephew James Naish has been the Labour Member of Parliament for Rushcliffe since 2024. 

Campbell&#x27;s older brother Donald suffered from schizophrenia and died in 2016, aged 62, from complications resulting from his illness. Campbell has talked extensively about how Donald had inspired him to fight for better mental health services and understanding, and to become the ambassador for several mental health charities.

Campbell is a lifelong Burnley supporter. He is regularly involved in events with the club, and was involved in rescuing the club from potential bankruptcy. He was one of the founders of the University College of Football Business, based at Burnley&#x27;s stadium. Campbell is also a fan of the rugby league club Keighley Cougars, as it had been a childhood dream of his to play for the team.

In his spare time, Campbell plays the bagpipes to relieve stress. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he performed on the bagpipes in a charity song written by Martin Gillespie of Scottish band Skerryvore, &quot;Everyday Heroes&quot;, which topped the iTunes download charts. Campbell also has an interest in the music of the Belgian singer Jacques Brel. 

Campbell is a keen runner, cyclist, swimmer and triathlete, having raised over half a million pounds for charity running the London Marathon in 2003. In his 60s, he developed an interest in cold water swimming. Campbell has described himself as a pro-faith atheist.

== Stage and screen portrayals ==
&quot;Bremner, Bird and Fortune&quot; often satirised Campbell during the Blair years. In 2005, Campbell was played by Jonathan Cake in the Channel 4 television film &quot;The Government Inspector&quot;, based on the David Kelly Case. The following year, he was portrayed by Mark Bazeley in the Stephen Frears film &quot;The Queen&quot; – a role reprised by Bazeley in 2010 follow-up &quot;The Special Relationship&quot;. Alex Jennings portrayed Campbell in the television drama &quot;A Very Social Secretary&quot;. He featured in &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; and was portrayed by Adam Damerell in season 6 of &quot;The Crown&quot;. Campbell has been cited as the inspiration for the character of Malcolm Tucker in the BBC political satire comedy &quot;The Thick of It&quot;.

== Television appearances ==
In 2006 and 2007, Campbell took part in Soccer Aid as part of the Rest of the World team. He appeared with Diego Maradona and Paul Gascoigne to raise money for UNICEF. Also in 2007, he appeared on &quot;Comic Relief Does The Apprentice&quot;.

Campbell appeared as a mentor in the BBC Two series &quot;The Speaker&quot; in April 2009, offering his advice on persuasive speaking.

Campbell appeared on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; in July 2010, where he was booed by some members of the audience but set a time of 1:47 around the &quot;Top Gear&quot; test track in the Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car segment.

Campbell also took part in the 2011 Channel 4 television series &quot;Jamie&#x27;s Dream School&quot;.
In June 2012, he was guest presenter of &quot;Have I Got News for You.&quot;

Campbell presented and narrated the 20 February 2012 edition of the BBC current affairs programme &quot;Panorama&quot;, which was entitled &quot;Britain&#x27;s Hidden Alcoholics&quot;.

In 2012, Campbell made his first appearance in an acting role with a small part in an episode of the BBC drama &quot;Accused&quot;.

In November 2021 Campbell was featured in the BBC series &quot;Winter Walks&quot;, walking in the Yorkshire Dales along Ribblesdale, from a waterfall above the market town of Settle, to Catrigg Force near Stainforth, to the North.

In May 2022 it was announced that Campbell would appear in the Channel 4 political entertainment series &quot;Make Me Prime Minister&quot;, due to broadcast at the end of September 2022.

In May 2023, Campbell was involved in a heated debate with Alex Phillips, a member of Reform UK, on BBC Newsnight. Phillips later accused Campbell of &quot;bullying, intimidation and thinly veiled misogyny&quot;. He later apologised to the presenter, Victoria Derbyshire, for his behaviour.

<text>Wen Ho Lee or Li Wenho (; born December 21, 1939) is a Taiwanese-American nuclear scientist and a mechanical engineer who worked for the University of California at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. He created computerized simulations of nuclear explosions for the purposes of scientific inquiry, as well as for improving the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.

A federal grand jury indicted him on charges of stealing secrets about the U.S. nuclear arsenal for the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) in December 1999. After federal investigators were unable to prove these initial accusations, the government conducted a separate investigation. Ultimately it charged Lee only with improper handling of restricted data, one of the original 59 indictment counts, a felony count. He pleaded guilty as part of a plea settlement.

He filed a civil suit that was settled. In June 2006, Lee received $1.6 million from the federal government and five media organizations as part of a settlement for leaking his name to the press before any charges had been filed against him.

Federal judge James A. Parker eventually apologized to Lee for denying him bail and putting him in solitary confinement. He excoriated the government for misconduct and misrepresentations to the court.

== Early life ==
Wen Ho Lee was born on December 21, 1939, to a Hoklo family in Taiwan during Japanese rule. He graduated from Keelung High School in the northern part of the island in 1959, after which he attended National Cheng Kung University in Tainan, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering in 1963.

In &quot;My Country Versus Me&quot;, Lee describes life as being harsh. His father died when Lee was very young. His mother suffered from asthma and eventually committed suicide so that she would not &#x27;burden&#x27; the family. He was a young boy in Taiwan when Republic of China (ROC) forces violently suppressed the February 28 Incident of 1947. Taiwan was placed under martial law; his brother died when he was a conscript and his commanding officers allegedly would not allow him to take medicine. Lee overcame steep odds. He had what he describes as a wonderful teacher in the 6th grade who encouraged his intellectual abilities. Eventually, he made his way to university, where he became interested in fluid dynamics and studied mechanical engineering.

==Graduate education and career==

Lee came to the United States in 1965 to continue his studies in mechanical engineering at Texas A&amp;M University. He received his doctorate in mechanical engineering with specialization in fluid mechanics in 1969 and was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1974.

He was employed at industrial and government research firms before he moved to New Mexico in 1978. He worked as a scientist in weapons design at Los Alamos National Laboratory, in applied mathematics and fluid dynamics, from that year until 1999. He created simulation software for nuclear explosions, which were used to gain scientific understanding and help maintain the safety and reliability of the US nuclear weapons arsenal.

== Government investigation ==

Lee was publicly named by United States Department of Energy officials, including Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson, as a suspect in the theft of classified nuclear-related documents from Los Alamos. Richardson was criticized by the Senate for his handling of the espionage inquiry because he had not testified sooner before Congress. Richardson was less than truthful in his response by saying that he was waiting to uncover more information before speaking to Congress.

On December 10, 1999, Lee was arrested, indicted on 59 counts, and jailed in solitary confinement without bail for 278 days. On September 13, 2000, he accepted a plea bargain from the federal government. Lee was released on time served after the government&#x27;s case against him could not be proven. Part of his defense rested on a graymail strategy, which tried to compel prosecutors to release large amounts of classified material related to nuclear weapons. He was ultimately charged only with one count of mishandling sensitive documents, which did not require pre-trial solitary confinement. The other 58 counts were dropped.

President Bill Clinton issued a public apology to Lee over his treatment by the federal government during the investigation. Lee filed a civil lawsuit to gain the names of public officials who had leaked his name to journalists before charges had been filed against him. It raised issues, similar to those in the Valerie Plame affair, of whether journalists should have to reveal their anonymous sources in a court of law.

Lee&#x27;s lawsuit was settled by the federal government in 2006 just before the Supreme Court was set to decide whether to hear the case. The federal judge who heard the case during an earlier appeal said that &quot;top decision makers in the executive branch...have embarrassed our entire nation and each of us who is a citizen.&quot;

===Operation Kindred Spirit===
After an intelligence agent from the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) gave U.S. agents papers which indicated that they knew the design of a particularly modern U.S. nuclear warhead (the W-88), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) started an investigation codenamed &quot;Operation Kindred Spirit&quot; to look into how China could have obtained that design.

In 1982, Lee was recorded on a wiretap speaking with another Taiwanese-American scientist who had been accused of espionage. Lee offered to the scientist to find out who had turned him in. When confronted by the FBI about this incident, Lee said he did not know the scientist, until the FBI demonstrated proof of the conversation. Despite some evidence that could have kept the case open, the FBI closed this file on Lee in 1984.

Lee did not get the attention of the FBI again for 12 years until 1998. The FBI had lost the file on Lee from the 1983 and 1984 meetings with him, and had to reconstruct the information. In 1994, a delegation of Chinese scientists visited Los Alamos National Laboratory in an unannounced capacity for a meeting. One of the scientists visiting was Dr. Hu Side, the head of the Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics. He also was credited with the design of the small, W88-like weapon. However, despite the visit being unannounced, Lee showed up to the meeting uninvited.

This alarmed LANL officials who contacted the FBI, which opened up another investigation of Lee. On December 23, 1998, Lee was given a polygraph test by Wackenhut, a DOE contractor. He was not told of the reason why, other than that it involved his latest trip to China to escort his nephew. During the questioning, he admitted that he had, in fact, met with Dr. Hu Side in a hotel room in 1988 and that Hu had asked him for classified information, which he refused to discuss.

Lee admitted that he failed to report this contact and approach by individuals requesting classified information as required by security regulations. He was told that he passed the test, but was stripped of his Q clearance to the LANL&#x27;s classified X Division section. Although he questioned the action against him, Lee went along, deleting the classified information he held on his computers, and moved to the T (unclassified) clearance zone. He was later subjected to three more polygraph tests before being told by the FBI agents that re-evaluation of the test results showed that Lee had failed all of them.

In January, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; ran an article on the investigation, headlined &quot;China Got Secret Data on U.S. Warhead -- Chief Suspect Is a Scientist at Weapons Laboratory of Energy Department,&quot; without naming a suspect. On March 6, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an article on the W-88 case, &quot;China Stole Nuclear Secrets for Bombs, U.S. Aides Say,&quot; again without naming the suspect. Government officials had requested the newspaper delay publication, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; held back publication for one day, saying it would consider a further delay if asked personally by the FBI director, who did not act on the request.

The FBI interviewed Dr. Lee on March 5, and he consented to a search of his office. On March 8, 1999, Lee was fired from his job at Los Alamos National Laboratory for failure to maintain classified information securely. However, FBI investigators soon determined that the design data the PRC had obtained could not have come from the Los Alamos Lab, because it related to information that would only have been available to someone like a so-called &quot;downstream&quot; contractor, meaning one involved in the final warhead production process, and this information was only created after the weapon design left the LANL.

Even though this left Wen Ho Lee apparently in the clear, the FBI continued its attempt to find evidence to implicate Lee in committing espionage for the PRC. There were 60 agents and more assigned to Lee&#x27;s case, working to prove that he was a spy. The FBI conducted a search of Lee&#x27;s house on April 10, seizing any item related to computers or computing, as well as anything that had notations written in Chinese. The FBI and the Department of Energy then decided to conduct a full forensic examination of Lee&#x27;s office computer. The examination of Lee&#x27;s computer determined that he had backed up his work files, which were restricted though not classified, onto tapes, and had also transferred these files from a system used for processing classified data onto another, also secure, system designated for unclassified data.

After the FBI discovered Lee&#x27;s transfer, they revoked his badge access and clearance, including his ability to access the data from the unclassified but secure network. Lee then requested from a colleague in another part of Los Alamos to be allowed to use his computer, at which time he transferred the data to a third unclassified computer network. The government then retroactively redesignated the data Lee had copied, changing it from its former designation of &quot;PARD&quot; (Protect As Restricted Data), which was just above the &quot;Unclassified&quot; designation and contained 99 percent unclassified data, to a new designation of &quot;Secret&quot; (which was treated on a higher security level than PARD), giving them the crime that the government needed for a formal charge.

==Indictment, imprisonment and release==
The Department of Justice constructed its case around the only real evidence of malfeasance, the downloading of the restricted information. It ultimately employed an unusual strategy of trying to prove that in addition to illegally handling information, Dr. Lee had an &quot;intent to injure&quot; the United States by denying it the exclusivity of the nuclear information. Lee was indicted on 59 counts, 39 of which were for mishandling information under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, and 20 of which were for lesser violations of the Espionage Act. (The original Atomic Energy Act, also known as the McMahon Act, was passed in response to the case of Cambridge physicist Alan Nunn May after he confessed to giving Manhattan Project secrets to the USSR.) Janet Reno confirmed with CIA Director George Tenet and FBI Director Louis Freeh that if the presiding judge rules that the government must reveal in open court what specifically was on the tapes, the prosecution would have to plea out the case or risk jeopardizing state secrets.

Dr. Lee spent nine months incarcerated in solitary confinement with limited access to family. His treatment, which included constant shackling, was inconsistent with treatment of other prisoners at the Santa Fe County detention facility, and became a source of great controversy for the DOJ. In September 2000, Judge Parker ruled that the government was required to disclose the information on the tapes. According to Louis Freeh and Janet Reno, they were left with no option but to plea out Dr. Lee in order to find out where the missing tapes were, and not risk sensitive government information by bringing it to trial. Dr. Lee was freed, and at plea admitted to having made copies of the tapes which he later destroyed, according to his book &quot;My Country Versus Me,&quot; and other sources.

Lee pleaded guilty to one felony count of illegal &quot;retention&quot; of &quot;national defense information&quot;. In return, the government released him from jail and dropped the other 58 counts against him. Judge Parker apologized to Dr. Lee for the unfair manner in which he was treated. The judge also regretted being misled by the executive branch into ordering Dr. Lee&#x27;s detention, stating that he was led astray by the Department of Justice, by its FBI, and by its United States attorney. He formally denounced the government for abuse of power in its prosecution of the case. Later, President Bill Clinton remarked that he had been &quot;troubled&quot; by the way Dr. Lee was treated.

==Post-release==
Lee is now retired and lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico with his wife. He also has two adult children – a son, and a daughter, Alberta, who at one time was an intern at Los Alamos Laboratory. In 2003, he wrote a memoir, &quot;My Country Versus Me&quot;, in which he describes his love of classical music, literature, poetry, fishing in the mountains of New Mexico, and his dedication to organic gardening. He also charges that his Asian ethnicity was a primary factor behind his prosecution by the government. As evidence of such racial profiling, he cited cases of several scientists of non-Han Chinese ancestry who were responsible for similar security transgressions but were able to continue their careers. Former FBI Director Louis Freeh categorically denied these charges.

Lee was compensated with a $1.6 million settlement from the U.S. federal government and five news organizations for privacy violations. A condition of the United States portion of the settlement, $895,000, is that it is to be applied only to lawyer&#x27;s fees and the taxes on the media&#x27;s payments, since the government insisted that they would not pay anything that would be perceived as damages to Lee.

He has published an applied physics textbook that he started writing while still in prison.

==In media==
The 2001 play &quot;The Legacy Codes&quot;, by American playwright Cherylene Lee, deals with the Wen Ho Lee case.

The short story &quot;Amnesty&quot; in the 2005 edition of Octavia Butler&#x27;s collection &quot;Bloodchild and Other Stories&quot; was inspired by the government&#x27;s treatment of Lee.

The 2007 play &quot;Yellow Face&quot; by Asian-American playwright David Henry Hwang places this incident in the context of a greater number of cases dealing with racial profiling against Asian Americans, particularly the Chinese during the 1990s.

The 2010 short film &quot;The Profile&quot; and its animated remake (the 2017 short film &quot;Disk 44&quot;), both by American film maker Ray Arthur Wang, are inspired by the Lee case.

<doc id="265585" wikidata="Q201462" url="?curid=265585" title="Little Italy, Manhattan">
<text>Little Italy (also ) is a neighborhood in Lower Manhattan in New York City, known for its former Italian population. It is bounded on the west by Tribeca and Soho, on the south by Chinatown, on the east by the Bowery and Lower East Side, and on the north by Nolita.

==History==

Little Italy used to extend as far south as Worth Street, as far north as Houston Street, as far west as Lafayette Street, and as far east as Bowery. It is now only five blocks on Mulberry Street north of Canal St. Little Italy originated at Mulberry Bend south of Canal, in what had formerly been the Five Points area but is now the heart of Chinatown. Jacob Riis described Mulberry Bend as &quot;the foul core of New York&#x27;s slums.&quot; During this time period &quot;Immigrants of the late 19th century usually settled in ethnic neighborhoods&quot;. Therefore, the &quot;mass immigration from Italy during the 1880s&quot; led to the large settlement of Italian immigrants in lower Manhattan. The results of such migration had created an &quot;influx of Italian immigrants&quot; which had &quot;led to the commercial gathering of their dwelling and business&quot;.

Italian immigrants from Naples settled on Mulberry Street, immigrants from Puglia and Calabria settled on Mott Street, immigrants from Sicily settled on Elizabeth Street, and immigrants from northern Italy, especially Genoa settled on Baxter Street.

Bill Tonelli from &quot;New York&quot; magazine said, &quot;Once, Little Italy was like an insular Neapolitan village re-created on these shores, with its own language, customs, and financial and cultural institutions.&quot; Little Italy was not the largest Italian neighborhood in New York City, as East Harlem (or Italian Harlem) had a larger Italian population. Tonelli said that Little Italy &quot;was perhaps the city&#x27;s poorest Italian neighborhood&quot;.

In 1910 Little Italy had almost 10,000 Italians; that was the peak of the community&#x27;s Italian population. At the turn of the 20th century, over 90% of the residents of the Fourteenth Ward were of Italian birth or origins. Tonelli said that it meant &quot;that residents began moving out to more spacious digs almost as soon as they arrived.&quot; Such a vastly growing community impacted the &quot;U.S. labor movement in the 20th century&quot; by making up much of the labor population in the garment industry&quot;.

After World War II, many residents of the Lower East Side began moving to Brooklyn, Staten Island, eastern Long Island, Westchester and New Jersey. Chinese immigrants became an increased presence after the U.S. Immigration Act of 1965 removed immigration restrictions, and the Manhattan Chinatown to Little Italy&#x27;s south expanded. In 2004, Tonelli said, &quot;You can go back 30 years and find newspaper clips chronicling the expansion of Chinatown and mourning the loss of Little Italy.&quot;

Before 2004, several upscale businesses entered the northern portion of the area between Houston and Kenmare Street. Tonelli said, &quot;Real-estate prices zoomed, making it even tougher for the old-timers—residents and businesspeople alike—to hang on.&quot; After the September 11 attacks in 2001, areas below Houston Street were cut off for the rest of the fall of 2001. The San Gennaro feast, scheduled for September 13, was postponed. Business from the Financial District dropped severely, due to the closure of Park Row, which connected Chinatown and the Civic Center; as a result, residents in Little Italy and Chinatown suffered. Tonelli said the post-9/11 events &quot;strangely enough, ended up motivating all these newfangled efforts to save what&#x27;s left of the old neighborhood.&quot;
In 2004 Tonelli said &quot;Today, Little Italy is a veneer—50 or so restaurants and cafés catering to tourists, covering a dense neighborhood of tenements shared by recent Chinese immigrants, young Americans who can&#x27;t afford Soho, and a few remaining real live Italians.&quot; This sentiment has also been echoed by Italian culture and heritage website &quot;ItalianAware&quot;. The site has called the dominance of Italians in the area &quot;relatively short-lived.&quot; It attributes this to the quick financial prosperity many Italians achieved, which allowed them to leave the cramped neighborhood for areas in Brooklyn and Queens. The site also goes on to state that the area is currently referred to as Little Italy more out of nostalgia than as a reflection of a true ethnic population.

In 2010, Little Italy and Chinatown were listed in a single historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. Little Italy, by this point, was shrinking rapidly.

Foods and traditions that were invented in Little Italy include sausage and peppers and the rainbow cookie. In addition, the Italian-American Christmas Eve tradition of the Feast of the Seven Fishes originated in Little Italy back in the late 1800s.

== Demographic changes==

&quot;The New York Times&quot; sent its reporters to characterize the Little Italy/Mulberry neighborhood in May 1896:

They are laborers; toilers in all grades of manual work; they are artisans, they are junkman, and here, too, dwell the rag pickers. ... There is a monster colony of Italians who might be termed the commercial or shop keeping community of the Latins. Here are all sorts of stores, pensions, groceries, fruit emporiums, tailors, shoemakers, wine merchants, importers, musical instrument makers. ... There are notaries, lawyers, doctors, apothecaries, undertakers. ... There are more bankers among the Italians than among any other foreigners except the Germans in the city.

Since the late 1960s, when the United States allowed immigration from China, Chinatown&#x27;s traditional boundary at Canal Street has inched northward into Little Italy. By the 1990s, while many Italian business remained, the blocks between Canal and Kenmare Streets had taken on a feel of Chinatown, though locals continue to refer to the area (including Nolita) as Little Italy.

As of the 2000 census, 1,211 residents claiming Italian ancestry lived in three census tracts that make up Little Italy. Those residents comprise 8.25% of the population in the community, which is similar to the proportion of those of Italian ancestry throughout New York City. Bill Tonelli of &quot;New York&quot; magazine contrasted Little Italy with the Manhattan Chinatown; in 2000, of the residents of the portions of Chinatown south of Grand Street, 81% were of Chinese origins.

In 2004, Tonelli revisited the issue, saying, &quot;Little Italy may always endure as an open-air theme park of nineteenth- and twentieth-century European immigration to the Lower East Side ... But you&#x27;ll spend a long time in the neighborhood before you hear anyone speak Italian, and then the speaker will be a tourist from Milan.&quot; Tonelli added, &quot;You have to slow your gaze to find the neighbors in this neighborhood, because they&#x27;re so overwhelmed and outnumbered by the tourists. But once you focus, you can see them, standing (or sitting) in the interstices, taking in the scene, like the group of men, mostly senior citizens, loitering contentedly under an awning on Mulberry Street.&quot;

By 2010 the U.S. Community Survey found that none of the people living in Little Italy were born in Italy, and 5% of residents identified as Italian American.

==Cultural attractions==

Little Italy was home to dozens of restaurants that serve authentic Italian cuisine, but between March 2013 and March 2014, eight eateries closed down.

Since 2004, Sorrento Lactalis funds neighborhood cultural events in Little Italy.

The Feast of San Gennaro originally was once only a one-day religious commemoration. It began in September 1926 with the new arrival of immigrants from Naples. The Italian immigrants congregated along Mulberry Street in Manhattan&#x27;s &quot;Little Italy&quot; to celebrate San Gennaro as the Patron Saint of Naples. The &quot;Feast of San Gennaro&quot; is a large street fair, lasting 11 days, that takes place every September along Mulberry Street between Houston and Canal Streets.

The festival is an annual celebration of Italian culture and the Italian-American community. In 1995, Mort Berkowitz became the professional manager of a community group that had been formed to take over management of the San Gennaro feast. Since then, Berkowitz became involved in other recreational activities in Little Italy, including the summer, Carnevale, Columbus Day, and Christmas events.

Richard Alba, a sociologist and professor at University at Albany, SUNY, said, &quot;The fascinating part here is the way in which ethnic tourism—not only by Italian Americans but by people who want to see an authentic urban village—keeps these neighborhoods going.&quot;

Little Italy was also home to Alleva Dairy, the oldest cheese shop in the United States. The store was founded in 1892 and was located on Grand Street until March 2023, when it closed its Little Italy location and announced a move to Lyndhurst, New Jersey.

==Organized crime and the Mafia==
Little Italy residents have seen organized crime since the early 20th century. Powerful members of the Italian Mafia have operated in &quot;Little Italy&quot;.
* Ignazio &quot;The Wolf&quot; Lupo (a Morello crime family boss operated in Little Italy from late 1890s-1920s)
* Paolo Antonio &quot;Paul Kelly&quot; Vaccarelli (founder of the Five Points Gang, who operated in Little Italy in the early twentieth century)
* Michele &quot;Big Mike&quot; Miranda (a Capo in the Genovese crime family operated in the neighborhood from the 1950s into the late 1960s)
* Peter DeFeo (a &quot;Genovese crime family&quot; capo who operated an illegal &quot;Italian lottery&quot; in the 1960s into the 1970s)
* Matthew &quot;Matty the Horse&quot; Ianniello, a &quot;Genovese crime family&quot; capo operated from his restaurant &quot;Umberto&#x27;s Clam House&quot; in the 1970s
* John Gotti, boss of the Gambino crime family operated from the Ravenite Social Club in the late 1980s into the early 1990s

==Notable people==
* Robert De Niro, actor and film producer
* Gianni Russo, actor and singer
* Catherine Scorsese, actress
* Charles Scorsese, actor
* Martin Scorsese, filmmaker

==In popular culture==
Little Italy is the locale of the fictional Corleone family depicted in the novel &quot;The Godfather&quot; and the film trilogy based on it. It is also the setting for the Martin Scorsese film &quot;Mean Streets&quot; (1973), starring Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro, the latter of whom also grew up in the neighborhood, and the Luc Besson film &quot;Léon: The Professional&quot; (1994), starring Jean Reno, Gary Oldman, and Natalie Portman. It is also depicted in the series finale of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, titled &quot;Made in America&quot;, where a character walks down a block and finds himself in Chinatown, demonstrating how Little Italy has shrunk.

==Other Italian American neighborhoods in New York City==

Other Italian American neighborhoods in New York City include:
* In Manhattan - East Harlem (Italian Harlem, Pleasant Avenue), Greenwich Village, and Nolita
* In the Bronx - Fordham (Arthur Avenue), Belmont, Morris Park, Country Club, and Pelham Bay
* In Brooklyn - Bensonhurst, Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights, Bath Beach, Gravesend, South Brooklyn (especially Carroll Gardens), East Williamsburg and other neighborhoods
* In Queens - Howard Beach, Ozone Park, Middle Village, Astoria, and other neighborhoods
* In Staten Island - the borough has the highest proportion of Italian Americans of any county in the United States and possibly North America. Over 200,000 residents claim Italian heritage, representing over 40% of the total population, with Rosebank being the first Italian enclave.

<text>Jeremy Charles Robert Clarkson (born 11 April 1960) is an English television presenter, journalist, farmer, and author who specialises in motoring. He is best known for hosting the television programmes &quot;Top Gear&quot; (2002–2015) and &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; (2016–2024) alongside Richard Hammond and James May. He also currently writes weekly columns for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and &quot;The Sun&quot;. Clarkson hosts the ITV game show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; (2018–present), and co-hosts the farming documentary show &quot;Clarkson&#x27;s Farm&quot; (2021–present).

From a career as a local journalist in northern England, Clarkson rose to public prominence as a presenter of the original format of &quot;Top Gear&quot; in 1988. Since the mid-1990s, he has become a recognised public personality, regularly appearing on British television presenting his own shows for the BBC and appearing as a guest on other shows. As well as motoring, Clarkson has produced programmes and books on subjects such as history and engineering, and has written numerous books. In 1998, he hosted the first series of &quot;Robot Wars;&quot; from 1998 to 2000, he also hosted his own talk show, &quot;Clarkson&quot;.

In 2015, the BBC elected not to renew Clarkson&#x27;s contract after he assaulted a &quot;Top Gear&quot; producer while filming on location. That year, Clarkson and his &quot;Top Gear&quot; co-presenters and producer Andy Wilman formed the production company W. Chump &amp; Sons to produce &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; for Amazon Prime Video.

Clarkson&#x27;s opinionated but humorous tongue-in-cheek writing and presenting style has often provoked a public reaction. His actions, both privately and as a &quot;Top Gear&quot; presenter, have also sometimes resulted in criticism from the media, politicians, pressure groups, and the public. He also has a significant public following, being credited as a major factor in the resurgence of &quot;Top Gear&quot; as one of the most popular shows on the BBC.

Since 2019, he has become a farmer at Diddly Squat Farm for his show, &quot;Clarkson&#x27;s Farm&quot;. The show received a positive reception and became a popular show on Prime Video upon its release. In May 2024, the &quot;Clarkson&#x27;s clause&quot; amendment, named after Clarkson, was introduced which made it easier to convert unused agricultural buildings to commercial usage, something he did in Season 2 of the show when planning permission for his restaurant was denied.

==Early life==

===Childhood===
Jeremy Charles Robert Clarkson was born on 11 April 1960 in Tickhill, then part of West Riding of Yorkshire. He is the son of Shirley Gabrielle Clarkson (&quot;née&quot; Ward), a teacher, and Edward Grenville Clarkson, a travelling salesman. His parents, who ran a business selling tea cosies, put their son&#x27;s name down in advance for private schools, with no idea how they were going to pay the fees. However, shortly before his admission, when he was 13, his parents made two Paddington Bear stuffed toys for Clarkson and his sister Joanna. These proved so popular that they started selling them through the business. Because they were manufacturing and selling the bears without regard to intellectual property rights, upon his becoming aware of the bears Michael Bond took action through his solicitors. Edward Clarkson travelled to London to meet Bond&#x27;s lawyer. By coincidence, he met Bond in the lift, and the two struck up an immediate rapport. Consequently, Bond awarded the Clarksons the licensing of the bear rights throughout the world, with the family eventually selling to Britain&#x27;s then leading toystore, Hamleys. The income from this success enabled the Clarksons to be able to pay the fees for Jeremy to attend Hill House School, Doncaster, and later Repton School.

===Repton School===
Clarkson has stated he was deeply unhappy at Repton School, saying that he had been a &quot;suicidal wreck&quot; there, having experienced extreme bullying. He alleged that:
I suffered many terrible things. I was thrown on an hourly basis into the ice plunge pool, dragged from my bed in the middle of the night and beaten, made to lick the lavatories clean and all the usual humiliations that... turn a small boy into a gibbering, sobbing, suicidal wreck... they glued my records together, snapped my compass, ate my biscuits, defecated in my tuck box and they cut my trousers in half.

According to his own account, he was expelled from Repton School for &quot;drinking, smoking and generally making a nuisance of himself&quot;. He famously left with one C and two U (fail) grades at A level. Clarkson attended Repton alongside future Formula One engineer Adrian Newey and former &quot;Top Gear&quot; Executive Producer Andy Wilman. He played the role of a preparatory school pupil, Atkinson, in a BBC radio &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; serial adaptation of Anthony Buckeridge&#x27;s &quot;Jennings&quot; novels until his voice broke.

==Career==

===Writing career===
Clarkson&#x27;s first job was as a travelling salesman for his parents&#x27; business, selling Paddington Bear toys.
He later trained as a journalist with the &quot;Rotherham Advertiser&quot;, before also writing for the &quot;Rochdale Observer&quot;, &quot;Wolverhampton Express and Star&quot;, &quot;Lincolnshire Life&quot;, &quot;Shropshire Star&quot; and the Associated Kent Newspapers. When writing in 2015 in his final column for &quot;Top Gear&quot; magazine, he credited the &quot;Shropshire Star&quot; as his first outlet as a motoring columnist: &quot;I started small, on the &quot;Shropshire Star&quot; with little Peugeots and Fiats and worked my way up to Ford Granadas and Rovers until, after about seven years, I was allowed to drive an Aston Martin Lagonda... It was 10 years before I drove my first Lamborghini.&quot;

In 1984, Clarkson formed the Motoring Press Agency (MPA), in which, with fellow motoring journalist Jonathan Gill, he conducted road tests for local newspapers and automotive magazines. This developed into articles for publications such as &quot;Performance Car&quot;. He has regularly written for &quot;Top Gear&quot; magazine since its launch in 1993. In 1987, Clarkson wrote for &quot;Amstrad Computer User&quot; and compiled Amstrad CPC game reviews.

Clarkson writes regular columns in the tabloid newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot;, and for the broadsheet newspaper &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. His columns in the &quot;Times&quot; are republished in &quot;The Weekend Australian&quot; newspaper. He also writes for the &quot;Wheels&quot; section of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. He has written humorous books about cars and several other subjects, with many of his books being collections of articles that he has written for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;.

===Television===

Clarkson&#x27;s first major television role came as one of the presenters on the British motoring programme &quot;Top Gear&quot;, from 27 October 1988, to 3 March 1999, in the programme&#x27;s earlier format. Jon Bentley, a researcher at &quot;Top Gear&quot;, helped launch his television career. Clarkson got the job after a screen test in which he spent 20 minutes ranting about the awfulness of the Citroen 2CV. Bentley shortly afterwards became the show&#x27;s producer, and said about hiring Clarkson: He was just what I was looking for – an enthusiastic motoring writer who could make cars on telly fun. He was opinionated and irreverent, rather than respectfully po-faced. The fact that he looked and sounded exactly like a twenty-something ex-public schoolboy didn&#x27;t matter. Nor did the impression there was a hint of school bully about him. I knew he was the man for the job. [...] Clarkson stood out because he was funny. Even my bosses allowed themselves the odd titter.

Clarkson then also presented the show&#x27;s new format from 20 October 2002, to 8 March 2015. Along with co-presenters James May and Richard Hammond, he is credited with turning &quot;Top Gear&quot; into the most-watched TV show on BBC Two, rebroadcast to over 100 countries around the world. Clarkson&#x27;s company Bedder 6, which handled merchandise and international distribution for &quot;Top Gear&quot;, earned over £149m in revenue in 2012, prior to a restructuring that gave BBC Worldwide full control of the &quot;Top Gear&quot; rights.

Clarkson presented the first series of the UK version of &quot;Robot Wars&quot;. In an on-set accident, a robot&#x27;s weapon flew off and became lodged in the wall inches from Clarkson. His talk show, &quot;Clarkson&quot;, comprised 27 half-hour episodes aired in the United Kingdom between November 1998 and December 2000, and featured guest interviews with musicians, politicians and television personalities. Clarkson went on to present documentaries focused on non-motoring themes such as history and engineering, although the motoring shows and videos continued. Alongside his stand-alone shows, many mirror the format of his newspaper columns and books, combining his love of driving and motoring journalism, with the examination and expression of his other views on the world, such as in &quot;Jeremy Clarkson&#x27;s Motorworld&quot;, &quot;Jeremy Clarkson&#x27;s Car Years&quot; and &quot;Jeremy Clarkson Meets the Neighbours&quot;.

After Trinny and Susannah labelled Clarkson&#x27;s dress sense as that of a market trader, he was persuaded to appear on their fashion makeover show &quot;What Not to Wear&quot; to avoid being considered for their all-time worst dressed winner award. Their attempts at restyling Clarkson were rebuffed, and Clarkson stated he would rather eat his own hair than appear on the show again. For an episode of the first series of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; broadcast in November 2004, Clarkson was invited to investigate his family history. It included the story of his great-great-great-grandfather, John Kilner (1792–1857), who invented the Kilner jar, a container for preserved fruit.

Clarkson&#x27;s views are often showcased on television shows. In 1997, Clarkson appeared on the light-hearted comedy show &quot;Room 101&quot;, in which a guest nominates things they hate in life to be consigned to nothingness. Clarkson dispatched caravans, houseflies, the sitcom &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;, the mentality within golf clubs, and vegetarians. He has made several appearances on the prime time talk shows &quot;Parkinson&quot; and &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; since 2002. By 2003, his persona was deemed to fit the mould for the series &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot;, in which middle-aged men talk about any aspects of modern life which irritate them. Since the topical news panel show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; dismissed regular host Angus Deayton in October 2002, Clarkson has become one of the most regularly used guest hosts on the show. Clarkson has appeared as a panellist on the political current affairs television show &quot;Question Time&quot; twice since 2000. On 2 October 2015, he presented &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; again for the first time since his dismissal.

Clarkson received a BAFTA nomination for Best Entertainment Performance in 2006. Jonathan Ross ended up winning the award. He won the National Television Awards Special Recognition Award in 2007, and reportedly earned £1 million that same year for his role as a &quot;Top Gear&quot; presenter, and a further £1.7 million from books, DVDs and newspaper columns. Clarkson and co-presenter James May were the first people to reach the North Magnetic Pole in a car also in 2007, chronicled in &quot;Top Gear: Polar Special&quot;.

He sustained minor injuries to his legs, back and hand in an intentional collision with a brick wall while making the 12th series of &quot;Top Gear&quot; in 2008. In 2014, he received a £4.8 million dividend and an £8.4 million share buyout from BBC Worldwide, bringing his estimated income for the year to more than £14 million. On 30 July 2015, it was announced that Clarkson, along with former &quot;Top Gear&quot; hosts Richard Hammond and James May would present a new show on Amazon Prime Video. The first season was made available worldwide in 2016. On 11 May 2016, Clarkson confirmed on his Twitter feed that the series would be titled &quot;The Grand Tour&quot;, and air from a different location each week. On 9 March 2018, it was announced that Clarkson would host a revamped series of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; on ITV.

==Opinions and influence==
===Politics===
Clarkson is in favour of personal freedom and against government regulation, stating that government should &quot;build park benches and that is it. They should leave us alone.&quot; He has a particular contempt for the Health and Safety Executive. He often criticised the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, especially what he calls the &quot;ban&quot; culture, frequently fixating on the bans on smoking and 2004 ban on fox hunting. In April 2013, Clarkson was among 2,000 invited guests to the funeral of Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

In an attempt to prove that the public furore over the 2007 UK child benefit data scandal was unjustified, he published his own bank account number and sort code, together with instructions on how to find out his address, in &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper, expecting nobody to be able to remove money from his account. He later discovered that someone had set up a monthly direct debit for £500 to Diabetes UK.

Clarkson supported a Remain vote in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, three days before the referendum, he and fellow presenter/best friend James May posted a video stating their support. Clarkson did not support Brexit, stating that while the European Union has its problems, Britain would not have any influence over the EU, should it leave the Union. He envisions the European Union being turned into a US-like &quot;United States of Europe&quot;, with one army, one currency, and one unifying set of values. In 2019, Clarkson said: &quot;Europe has to punish us—they can&#x27;t allow us to leave without being damaged because then everyone will want to go. We don&#x27;t want to go if we&#x27;re going to be damaged.&quot; In a January 2019 interview with LBC, Clarkson called Brexit voters &quot;coffin-dodging idiots&quot;, though also criticised the younger voters, who overwhelmingly supported Remain, for their voting inactivity.

Clarkson&#x27;s comments have both a large number of supporters and opponents. He often comments on the media-perceived social issues of the day, such as the fear of challenging adolescent youths, which he calls &quot;hoodies&quot;. In 2007, Clarkson was cleared of allegations of assaulting a young person while visiting central Milton Keynes, after Thames Valley Police said that if anything, he had been the victim. As a motoring journalist, he is frequently critical of government initiatives such as the London congestion charge or proposals on road charging. He is also frequently scornful of caravanners and cyclists. He has often singled out John Prescott, the former Transport Minister, and Stephen Joseph, the head of the public transport pressure group Transport 2000, for ridicule.

In September 2013, a tweet proposing that he might stand for election as an independent candidate in Doncaster North, the constituency of the then Labour leader of the opposition, Ed Miliband, was retweeted over 1,000 times – including by John Prescott. Clarkson has been critical of the Special Relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom. He referred to the US as the &quot;United States of Total Paranoia&quot;, commenting that one needs a permit to do everything except for purchasing weapons. In 2017, in response to the United States officially recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, Clarkson advised Palestinians to recognise London as the capital of the United States.

In 2020, Clarkson stated that he usually votes for the Conservative Party, claiming not to be a natural Tory but &quot;it just happens to be that every time it comes around and you weigh up which is going to provide you with a better life, the better country to live in, then it&#x27;s usually the Conservatives&quot;; he also mocked the policies of Tony Blair and Jeremy Corbyn, stating &quot;only an idiot would vote for Corbyn&quot;. Clarkson is also a personal friend of former Prime Minister, Conservative leader and Foreign Secretary David Cameron. However, he also expressed support of incumbent Labour leader (current UK Prime Minister) Keir Starmer and maintained that he was prepared to vote for Labour &quot;if there&#x27;s an election tomorrow&quot; citing Boris Johnson&#x27;s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in 2023 he expressed criticism of Starmer&#x27;s proposed economic and education policies. Ahead of the 2024 general election, Clarkson reversed his previous view on Starmer and stated &quot;I get, of course, that people are fed up with the Tories, but I’d rather vote for my dog than Sir Starmer’s merry bunch of ideological nincompoops&quot; and cited his opposition to Labour&#x27;s stance on farming.

In September 2022, he described socialists as &quot;disgusting people&quot;. Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, Clarkson shared a statement written by Boris Johnson on Twitter and captioned it &quot;I was trying to think of something to say but Boris Johnson has said it all&quot; and referred to the Queen as a &quot;magnificent monarch&quot;. In January 2023, Clarkson argued a left-wing &quot;coup&quot; had silently taken place in British politics, media and culture, writing &quot;We laugh as they change the name of the Sir Francis Drake Primary School to something less slavey. We think it&#x27;s all a big joke. But it isn&#x27;t. Think about what typically happens in a military operation and then look what the woke left has done here.&quot; He finished &quot;At least Arthur Scargill had the decency to get on a soapbox and state his aims in public. This lot don&#x27;t. They sit at home, hiding in the impenetrable shadow of anonymity, inventing new rules to ensnare anyone and everyone they deem to be unworthy.&quot;

In a March 2023 column for &quot;The Times,&quot; Clarkson criticised the response to JK Rowling&#x27;s comments on transgender issues, writing &quot;she wasn&#x27;t just cancelled. She was erased. They put her in the delete bin and then afterwards, all her former fans and even the actors and actresses she&#x27;d made famous emptied the bin into a landfill site.&quot; However, in the same article, Clarkson also argued that the existence of transgender people was not a new phenomenon, drawling parallels between the arrests of Alan Turing and Lucy Hicks Anderson, and that society could grow to accept trans people in the same way it has homosexuals, but accused teenage transgender rights movements of turning the debate into a culture war. He concluded, &quot;I realise, of course, that the whole trans debate has been hijacked by lunatics who glue themselves to stuff and claim to be from a gender that doesn&#x27;t even exist, and I know too that there is some kind of civil war going on between fiercely women women and women who just say they&#x27;re women. This creates a noise that&#x27;s annoying to most of us, but think how infuriating it must be to those who really were born in the wrong body?&quot;
===Criticism of Keir Starmer===
Since 2024, Clarkson has been extremely critical of Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the Labour Party. Clarkson attended the England farmers&#x27; protests in London where he called tax hikes a &quot;hammer blow to the back of the head&quot; of British agriculture. Clarkson later labelled Starmer &quot;a nightmare for farmers&quot;. Starmer is banned from Clarkson&#x27;s pub, The Farmer&#x27;s Dog, near Burford; Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch was however invited to discuss Starmer&#x27;s tax and the future of farming.

===Environment===
Clarkson is critical of the green movement and environmentalism, including groups such as Greenpeace—he has called them &quot;eco-mentalists&quot; and &quot;old trade unionists and CND lesbians&quot;. He also said that, although he &quot;hate[s] the movement, [he] loves the destination&quot; of environmentalism and believes that people should quietly strive to be more eco-friendly. He has been dismissive of windfarms and renewable energy and has spoken in support of hydrogen cars.

Clarkson rejects the scientific consensus on climate change, believing that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions do not affect the global climate. He has also expressed doubt that the effects of climate change are &quot;a bad thing&quot;, saying in 2005 &quot;let&#x27;s just stop and think for a moment what the consequences might be. Switzerland loses its skiing resorts? The beach in Miami is washed away? North Carolina gets knocked over by a hurricane? Anything bothering you yet?&quot; However, during a 2019 trip to Cambodia while filming &quot;The Grand Tour&quot;, Clarkson acknowledged the &quot;graphic demonstration&quot; of climate change impacts on the Mekong River and Tonlé Sap was &quot;genuinely alarming&quot;, but still expressed doubt that it was driven by human activity. Cambodia was undergoing a severe drought during the show&#x27;s filming. Clarkson is against climate activism, and has often made personal attacks against teenage activist Greta Thunberg, whom he has called &quot;a spoilt brat&quot;.

Environmentalists have protested or heckled Clarkson on a number of occasions for his views, including at his honorary degree ceremony at Oxford Brookes University, where a protester threw a banana meringue pie in his face in 2006, and in 2009 when activist group Climate Rush dumped horse manure on his lawn. Clarkson&#x27;s comments on Greta Thunberg were criticised by his own daughter.

===Himself===
Whilst Clarkson states such views as described above in his columns and in public appearances, his public persona does not necessarily represent his personal views, as he acknowledged whilst interviewing Alastair Campbell on &quot;Top Gear&quot;, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t believe what I write, any more than you [Campbell] believe what you say&quot;.

Clarkson has been described as a &quot;skillful propagandist for the motoring lobby&quot; by &quot;The Economist&quot;. With a forthright and sometimes deadpan delivery, Clarkson is said to thrive on the notoriety his public comments bring, and has risen to the level of the of the various groups who disagree with his views. On the Channel 4-organised viewer poll, for the &quot;100 Worst Britons We Love to Hate&quot; programme, Clarkson polled in 66th place. By 2005, Clarkson was perceived by the press to have upset so many people and groups, &quot;The Independent&quot; put him on trial for various &quot;crimes&quot;, declaring him guilty on most counts.

===Media===
Responses to Clarkson&#x27;s comments are often directed personally, with derogatory comments about residents of Norfolk leading to some residents organising a &quot;We hate Jeremy Clarkson&quot; club. In &quot;The Guardian&#x27;s&quot; 2007 &#x27;Media 100&#x27; list, which lists the top 100 most &quot;powerful people in the [media] industry&quot;, based on cultural, economic and political influence in the UK, Clarkson was listed as a new entrant at 74th. Some critics even attribute Clarkson&#x27;s actions and views as being influential enough to be responsible for the closure of Rover and the Luton manufacturing plant of Vauxhall. Clarkson&#x27;s comments about Rover prompted workers to hang an &quot;Anti-Clarkson Campaign&quot; banner outside the defunct Longbridge plant in its last days.

The BBC often played down his comments as ultimately not having the weight they were ascribed. In 2007, they described Clarkson as &quot;not a man given to considered opinion&quot;, and in response to an official complaint another BBC spokeswoman once said: &quot;Jeremy&#x27;s colourful comments are always entertaining, but they are his own comments and not those of the BBC. More often than not they are said with a twinkle in his eye.&quot; On his chat show, &quot;Clarkson&quot;, he caused upset to the Welsh by placing a 3D plastic map of Wales into a microwave oven and switching it on. He later defended this by saying, &quot;I put Wales in there because Scotland wouldn&#x27;t fit.&quot;

===Recognition===
In 2005, Clarkson received an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree from Oxford Brookes University. His views on the environment precipitated a small demonstration at the award ceremony for his honorary degree, when Clarkson was pied by road protester Rebecca Lush. Clarkson took this incident in good humour, responding &quot;good shot&quot; and subsequently referring to Lush as &quot;Banana girl&quot;.

In 2008, an internet petition was posted on the Prime Minister&#x27;s Number 10 website to &quot;Make Jeremy Clarkson Prime Minister&quot;. By the time it closed, it had attracted 49,446 signatures. An opposing petition posted on the same site set to &quot;Never, Ever Make Jeremy Clarkson Prime Minister&quot; attracted 87 signatures. Clarkson later commented he would be a rubbish Prime Minister as he is always contradicting himself in his columns. In the official response to the petition, Number 10 agreed with Clarkson&#x27;s comments.

In response to the reactions he gets, Clarkson has stated &quot;I enjoy this back and forth, it makes the world go round but it is just opinion.&quot; On the opinion that his views are influential enough to topple car companies, he has argued that he has proof that he has had no influence. &quot;When I said that the Ford Orion was the worst car ever it went on to become a best-selling car.&quot; Clarkson was ranked 49th on &quot;Motor Trend&quot; Magazine&#x27;s Power List for 2011, its list of the fifty most influential figures in the automotive industry. In 2023 and 2024, he was voted &quot;sexiest man&quot; in the UK.

==Other interests==

===Military interests===
Clarkson has a keen interest in the British Armed Forces and several of his DVDs and television shows have featured a military theme, such as flying in military jets or several Clarkson-focused &quot;Top Gear&quot; spots having a military theme such as Clarkson escaping a Challenger 2 tank in a Range Rover, a Lotus Exige evading missile lock from an Apache attack helicopter, a platoon of Irish Guardsmen shooting at a Porsche Boxster and Mercedes-Benz SLK, or using a Ford Fiesta as a Royal Marine landing craft. In October 2005, Clarkson visited British troops in Baghdad.

In 2003, Clarkson presented &quot;The Victoria Cross: For Valour&quot;, looking at recipients of the Victoria Cross, in particular focusing on his father-in-law, Robert Henry Cain, who received a VC for actions during the Battle of Arnhem in the Second World War. In 2007, Clarkson wrote and presented &quot;Jeremy Clarkson: Greatest Raid of All Time&quot;, a documentary about Operation Chariot in the Second World War, a 1942 Commando raid on the docks of Saint-Nazaire in occupied France. At the end of 2007, Clarkson became a patron of Help for Heroes, a charity aiming to raise money to provide better facilities to wounded British servicemen. His effort led to the 2007 Christmas appeal in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; supporting Help for Heroes.

===Engineering interests===
Clarkson is passionate about engineering, especially pioneering work. In &quot;Inventions That Changed the World&quot; Clarkson showcased the invention of the gun, computer, jet engine, telephone and television. He has previously criticised the engineering feats of the 20th century as merely improvements on the truly innovative inventions of the Industrial Revolution. He cites the lack of any source of alternative power for cars, other than by &quot;small explosions&quot;. In &quot;Great Britons&quot;, as part of a public poll to find the greatest historical Briton, Clarkson was the chief supporter for Isambard Kingdom Brunel, a prominent engineer during the Industrial Revolution credited with numerous innovations. Despite this, he also has a passion for many modern examples of engineering. In &quot;Speed&quot; and &quot;Extreme Machines&quot;, Clarkson rides and showcases numerous vehicles and machinery. Clarkson was awarded an honorary degree from Brunel University on 12 September 2003, partly because of his work in popularising engineering, and partly because of his advocacy of Brunel.

In his book &quot;I Know You Got Soul&quot;, he describes many machines that he believes possess a soul. He cited the Concorde crash as his inspiration, feeling a sadness for the demise of the machine as well as the passengers. Clarkson was a passenger on the last BA Concorde flight, on 24 October 2003. Paraphrasing Neil Armstrong, he described the retirement of the fleet as &quot;This is one small step for a man, but one huge leap backwards for mankind&quot;.

He briefly acquired an English Electric Lightning F1A jet fighter XM172 former RAF Coltishall gate guard, which was installed in the front garden of his country home. The Lightning was subsequently removed on the orders of the local council, which &quot;wouldn&#x27;t believe my claim that it was a leaf blower&quot;, according to Clarkson on a Tiscali Motoring webchat. The whole affair was set up for his programme &quot;Speed&quot;, the Lightning was later returned to Wycombe Air Park.

In a &quot;Top Gear&quot; episode, Clarkson drove the Bugatti Veyron in a race across Europe against a Cessna 182 piloted by co-presenter James May. The Veyron was an £850,000 technology demonstrator project built by Volkswagen to become the fastest production car, but a practical road car at the same time. In building such an ambitious machine, Clarkson described the project as &quot;a triumph for lunacy over common sense, a triumph for man over nature and a triumph for Volkswagen over absolutely every other car maker in the world.&quot; After winning the race, Clarkson announced that &quot;It&#x27;s quite a hollow victory really, because I&#x27;ve got to go for the rest of my life knowing that I&#x27;ll never own that car. I&#x27;ll never experience that power again.&quot;

Clarkson wanted to purchase the Ford GT after admiring its inspiration, the Ford GT40 race cars of the 1960s. Clarkson was able to secure a place on the shortlist for the few cars that would be imported to Britain to official customers, only through knowing Ford&#x27;s head of PR through a previous job. After waiting years and facing an increased price, he found many technical problems with the car. After &quot;the most miserable month&#x27;s motoring possible&quot;, he returned it to Ford for a full refund. After a short period, including asking &quot;Top Gear&quot; fans for advice over the Internet, he bought back his GT. He called it &quot;the most unreliable car ever made&quot;, because he was never able to complete a return journey with it.

In 2006, Clarkson ordered a Gallardo Spyder and sold the Ford GT to make way for it. In August 2008, he sold the Gallardo because &quot;idiots in Peugeots kept trying to race [him] in it&quot;. In October, he announced that he had sold his Volvo XC90. In January 2009, in a review of the car printed in &quot;The Times&quot;, he wrote: &quot;I&#x27;ve just bought my third Volvo XC90 in a row and the simple fact is this: it takes six children to school in the morning.&quot;

Clarkson has spoken highly of the Czech-made Škoda Yeti, calling it possibly the best car in the world, and used 20 minutes of a &quot;Top Gear&quot; episode putting the Yeti through a number of challenges to support his point. Clarkson called the Brera, Alfa&#x27;s latest sports car, &quot;Cameron Diaz on wheels&quot;. Clarkson has expressed fondness for late-model V8 Holdens, available in the UK rebadged as Vauxhalls. Of the Monaro he said, &quot;It&#x27;s like they had a picture of me on their desk and said Australian accent] &#x27;Let&#x27;s build that bloke a car!&#x27;&quot; and &quot;I can&#x27;t believe it... I&#x27;ve fallen in love... with a Vauxhall!&quot; Clarkson suffered two slipped discs that he attributed to driving the Monaro, which he described as being &quot;back-breakingly marvellous&quot;. Clarkson considers the Lexus LFA as the best car he has ever driven.

During &quot;Top Gear&quot;&#x27;s Patagonia Special, Clarkson said that the Porsche 928 was a car that was close to his heart because he was given the car to test for the series in 1994 and used it unexpectedly to drive from London to Sheffield to visit his dying father in hospital. Clarkson said that had he not driven the Porsche 928 (which was fast enough that a chicken he had cooked was &quot;still warm&quot; by the time he arrived in Sheffield) he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t have had the opportunity to say goodbye to [his] dad&quot;.

===Dislikes===

Clarkson dislikes the British car brand Rover, the last major British owned and built car manufacturer. This view stretched back to the company&#x27;s time as part of British Leyland. Describing the history of the company up to its last flagship model, the Rover 75, he paraphrased Winston Churchill and stated &quot;Never in the field of human endeavour has so much been done, so badly, by so many&quot;, citing issues with the rack and pinion steering system. In the latter years of the company, Clarkson blamed the &quot;uncool&quot; brand image as being more of a hindrance to sales than any faults with the cars. On its demise, Clarkson stated &quot;I cannot even get teary and emotional about the demise of the company itself – though I do feel sorry for the workforce.&quot; Clarkson has also expressed hatred for the Toyota Prius, Nissan Juke and Citroen 2CV.

Clarkson has also criticised Vauxhalls and has described Vauxhall&#x27;s parent company, General Motors, as a &quot;pensions and healthcare&quot; company which sees the &quot;car making side of the business as an expensive loss-making nuisance&quot;. Clarkson has expressed particular disdain for the Vauxhall Vectra, describing it as:
After a &quot;Top Gear&quot; piece by Clarkson for its launch in 1995, described by &quot;The Independent&quot; as &quot;not doing [GM] any favours&quot;, Vauxhall complained to the BBC and announced, &quot;We can take criticism but this piece was totally unbalanced.&quot;

==Controversies==

===Activities on &quot;Top Gear&quot;===

In 2004, the BBC apologised unreservedly and paid £250 in compensation to a Somerset parish council, after Clarkson damaged a 30-year-old horse-chestnut tree by driving into it to test the strength of a Toyota Hilux. In December 2006, the BBC complaints department upheld the complaint of four &quot;Top Gear&quot; viewers that Clarkson had used the phrase &quot;ginger beer&quot; (rhyming slang for &quot;queer&quot;) in a derogatory manner, when Clarkson picked up on and agreed with an audience member&#x27;s description of the Daihatsu Copen as being a bit &quot;gay&quot;. The &quot;Top Gear: Polar Special&quot; was criticised by the BBC Trust for glamorising drunk driving in a scene depicting Clarkson and James May consuming alcohol whilst Clarkson says to camera, &quot;And please do not write to us about drinking and driving, because I am not driving, I am sailing,&quot; thereby implying that they were driving on frozen international waters. Despite the show&#x27;s producers claiming that the incident occurred outside the jurisdiction of any drunk-driving laws, the BBC Trust maintained that the scene &quot;was not editorially justified&quot;.

In a later incident during a &quot;Top Gear&quot; episode broadcast on 13 November 2005, Clarkson, while talking about a Mini design that might be &quot;quintessentially German&quot;, made a mock Nazi salute, and made references to Nazi Germany and the German invasion of Poland by suggesting the GPS &quot;only goes to Poland&quot;. In November 2008, Clarkson attracted over 500 complaints to the BBC when he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes. The BBC stated the comment was a comic rebuttal of a common misconception about lorry drivers and was within the viewer&#x27;s expectation of Clarkson&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; persona. Chris Mole, the Member of Parliament for Ipswich, where five sex workers were murdered in 2006, wrote a &quot;strongly worded&quot; letter to BBC Director-General Mark Thompson, demanding that Clarkson be sacked. Clarkson dismissed Mole&#x27;s comments in his &quot;Sunday Times&quot; column the following weekend, writing, &quot;There are more important things to worry about than what some balding and irrelevant middle-aged man might have said on a crappy BBC2 motoring show.&quot; Andrew Tinkler, chief executive of the Eddie Stobart Group, a major trucking company, stated that &quot;They were just having a laugh. It&#x27;s the 21st century, let&#x27;s get our sense of humour in line.&quot;

In July 2009, Clarkson was reported to have called then British Prime Minister Gordon Brown &quot;a silly cunt&quot; during a warm-up while recording a &quot;Top Gear&quot; show. Although several newspapers reported that he had subsequently argued with BBC Two controller Janice Hadlow, who was present at the recording, the BBC denied that he had been given a &quot;dressing down&quot;. John Whittingdale, Conservative chair of the Culture Select Committee remarked: &quot;Many people will find that offensive, many people will find that word in particular very offensive [...] I am surprised he felt it appropriate to use it.&quot;

In July 2010, Clarkson reportedly angered gay rights campaigners after he made a remark on &quot;Top Gear&quot; that did not get aired on 4 July episode. However, guest Alastair Campbell wrote about it on Twitter. Clarkson said: &quot;I demand the right not to be bummed&quot;. The BBC later said that they cut this remark out, as they &quot;edited down&quot; the interview because it was too long to fit into the show.
In an episode aired after the watershed on 1 August 2010, Clarkson described a Ferrari F430 as &quot;special needs&quot;. He said the car owned by co-presenter James May looked &quot;like a simpleton&quot;. Media regulator Ofcom investigated after receiving two complaints, and found that the comments &quot;were capable of causing offence&quot; but did not censure the BBC.

On 12 January 2012, the Indian High Commission lodged a formal complaint with the BBC over the &quot;tasteless&quot; antics of Clarkson&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; Christmas special where he mocked India&#x27;s culture and people. During the 90-minute special, which was aired twice over the Christmas break, Clarkson made a string of jokes about Indian food, clothes, toilets, trains and history.
On an episode of &quot;Top Gear&quot; broadcast on 5 February 2012, Clarkson compared a Japanese car / camper van to a person with a growth on their face. A major UK charity that supports people with facial disfigurements, Changing Faces, complained to the BBC and Ofcom after Clarkson&#x27;s remarks.

In an unused take for a &quot;Top Gear&quot; feature recorded in early 2012, Clarkson is alleged to have mumbled the racial slur &quot;nigger&quot; when repeating the children&#x27;s rhyme Eeny, meeny, miny, moe. The clip later surfaced on the website of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; tabloid at the beginning of May 2014. In the take, Clarkson attempts to mumble the sentence so as to obscure the word, but admitted that upon a close listening, the word could still be heard. Clarkson apologised for his efforts not being &quot;quite good enough&quot; to ensure the footage was not used. It was reported on 3 May that the BBC had given Clarkson a final warning, with the presenter accepting that he would be sacked if he made another offensive remark.

Near the end of the &quot;Top Gear: Burma Special&quot;, which aired March 2014, Clarkson and Hammond were seen admiring a wooden bridge, which they had built during the episode. Clarkson is quoted as saying, &quot;That is a proud moment, but there&#x27;s a slope on it&quot; as a native crosses the bridge, with &quot;slope&quot; being a pejorative for Asians. &quot;Top Gear&quot; Executive Producer Andy Wilman responded: &quot;When we used the word slope in the recent &quot;Top Gear Burma Special&quot; it was a light-hearted word play joke referencing both the build quality of the bridge and the local Asian man who was crossing it. We were not aware at the time, and it has subsequently been brought to our attention, that the word slope is considered by some to be offensive.&quot;

In October 2014, Clarkson attracted controversy when filming the &quot;Top Gear: Patagonia Special&quot; after driving a Porsche 928 in Argentina with the registration number H982 FKL, allegedly referring to the 1982 Falklands War. Also, during the broadcast, Clarkson was seen referring to the controversy that had risen after the Burma Special; when inspecting a bridge, which he and his colleagues had built during the episode, he was quoted as saying &quot;That is a proud moment, Hammond, but... is it straight?&quot; With Hammond replying &quot;Yes&quot;.

===Activities outside &quot;Top Gear&quot;===
In October 1998, Hyundai complained to the BBC about what they described as &quot;bigoted and racist&quot; comments he made at the Birmingham Motor Show, where he was reported as saying that the people working on the Hyundai stand had &quot;eaten a dog&quot; and that the designer of the Hyundai XG had probably eaten a spaniel for his lunch. Clarkson also allegedly referred to those working on the BMW stand as &quot;Nazis&quot;, with BMW saying that they would not lodge a complaint and giving Clarkson &quot;the benefit of the doubt&quot;.

In March 2004, at the British Press Awards, he swore at Piers Morgan and punched him before being restrained by security; Morgan says it left him with a scar above his left eyebrow. In April 2007, Clarkson was criticised in the Malaysian parliament for having described one of their cars, the Perodua Kelisa, as the worst in the world, adding that &quot;its name was like a disease and [suggesting] it was built in jungles by people who wear leaves for shoes&quot;. A Malaysian government minister countered, pointing out that no complaints had been received from UK customers who had bought the car.

In February 2009, while in Australia, Clarkson made disparaging remarks aimed at the British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, calling him a &quot;one-eyed Scottish idiot&quot;, and accused him of lying. These comments were widely condemned by the Royal National Institute of Blind People and also Scottish politicians, who requested that he should be taken off air. He subsequently apologised for referencing Brown&#x27;s monocular blindness, but said: &quot;I haven&#x27;t apologised for calling him an idiot.&quot;

His column for &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper on 4 September 2011, drew angry remarks in response to Clarkson&#x27;s call to abolish the Welsh language: &quot;I think we are fast approaching the time when the United Nations should start to think seriously about abolishing other languages. What&#x27;s the point of Welsh, for example? All it does is provide a silly maypole around which a bunch of hotheads can get all nationalistic.&quot;

On 30 November 2011, while being interviewed on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The One Show&quot;, Clarkson commented on the UK&#x27;s public sector strike that day, lauding the capital&#x27;s empty roads. After mentioning the BBC&#x27;s need for balance, he said, &quot;I would take them outside and execute them in front of their families.&quot; The programme later apologised for his remarks, with further apologies issued by Clarkson and the BBC. These remarks had attracted 21,335 complaints to the BBC within 36 hours; the BBC also received 314 messages of support for Clarkson.

Clarkson was criticised by the mental health charity Mind for his 3 December 2011, column for &quot;The Sun&quot;, in which he described those who jump in front of trains as &quot;Johnny Suicide&quot; and argues that following a death, trains should carry on their journeys as soon as possible. He adds: &quot;The train cannot be removed nor the line reopened until all of the victim&#x27;s body has been recovered. And sometimes the head can be half a mile away from the feet.&quot; ... &quot;Change the driver, pick up the big bits of what&#x27;s left of the victim, get the train moving as quickly as possible and let foxy woxy and the birds nibble away at the smaller, gooey parts that are far away or hard to find.&quot;

===Road safety===
Clarkson often discusses high-speed driving on public roads, criticising road safety campaigns involving cameras and speed bumps. In 2002, a Welsh Assembly Member Alun Pugh wrote to BBC Director-General Greg Dyke to complain about Clarkson&#x27;s comments that he believed encouraged people to use Welsh roads as a high-speed test track. A BBC spokesman said that suggestions Clarkson had encouraged speeding were &quot;nonsense&quot;. Clarkson has also made similar comments about driving in Lincolnshire. In a November 2005 &quot;Times&quot; article, Clarkson wrote on the Bugatti Veyron, &quot;On a recent drive across Europe I desperately wanted to reach the top speed but I ran out of road when the needle hit 240 mph,&quot; and &quot;From the wheel of a Veyron, France is the size of a small coconut. I cannot tell you how fast I crossed it the other day. Because you simply wouldn&#x27;t believe me.&quot;

In 2007, solicitor Nick Freeman represented Clarkson against a charge of driving at 86 mph in a 50 mph zone on the A40 road in London, defeating it on the basis that the driver of the car loaned to Clarkson from Alfa Romeo could not be ascertained. In 2008, Clarkson claimed in a talk at the Hay Festival to have been given a speeding ticket for driving at 186 mph on the A1203 Limehouse Link road in London.

===Dismissal from &quot;Top Gear&quot;===

In March 2015, Clarkson was suspended by the BBC from &quot;Top Gear&quot; following a &quot;fracas&quot; with one of the show&#x27;s producers, Oisin Tymon. It emerged that Clarkson had been involved in a dispute over catering while filming on location in Hawes, North Yorkshire, having been refused a steak (the chef had gone home) and offered soup and cold meat instead.

The BBC announced that the next episode of the show would not be broadcast on 15 March. It was later announced through the BBC&#x27;s website that the network would be likely to drop the remaining two episodes of the series as well in the wake of the incident, which involved Clarkson punching producer Oisin Tymon, who was later treated in hospital. Tymon also said that Clarkson had called him a &quot;lazy Irish cunt&quot;. Clarkson&#x27;s contract with the BBC expired at the end of March, and a previously proposed three-year renewal was withdrawn.

A Change.org petition, aiming to reverse the BBC decision, was started on 10 March by blogger Guido Fawkes. The petition reached its target 1,000,000 signatures by the afternoon of 20 March, and was delivered to the BBC in an artillery vehicle by a man dressed as &quot;Top Gear&quot; test driver The Stig, with Fawkes as spokesman. The hosting website described the petition as the fastest-growing campaign in its history. On 19 March 2015, at a charity auction at the Roundhouse in Camden, north London, Clarkson launched into a verbal tirade against BBC studio bosses related to his suspension from the programme, saying &quot;The BBC have fucked themselves.&quot; He later stated that this was &quot;meant in jest&quot;.

On 25 March 2015, the BBC released an official statement confirming that, as a result of the actions which led to his suspension, they would not be renewing his contract with the show. Following the statement, North Yorkshire Police requested to view the report and stated that &quot;action will be taken by North Yorkshire police where necessary&quot;. However, Tymon informed the police that he did not wish to press charges against Clarkson, and Clarkson urged fans of the show to stop trolling Tymon on social media, as what happened was not his fault. British police investigated death threats made against BBC Director-General Tony Hall over Clarkson&#x27;s firing. Less than 24 hours after his dismissal, Clarkson was approached by Zvezda, a Russian state broadcaster, to present a motoring programme.

In his &quot;Sunday Times&quot; column on 19 April, Clarkson said that two days before he hit Tymon, he had been told by his doctor that a lump he had could be cancer of the tongue. Testing later confirmed that it was not cancerous. In the same column, he stated that he had initially considered retiring from television following his dismissal, but was now planning a new motoring programme. In November 2015, Tymon sued Clarkson and the BBC for racial discrimination over the verbal abuse he received in the March incident. The following February, Clarkson formally apologised to Tymon and settled the racial discrimination and personal injury claim for £100,000.

===&quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper column on the Duchess of Sussex===
In December 2022, he was criticised for one of his columns in &quot;The Sun&quot; on Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, which was deemed misogynistic by critics as he stated:

He later said it was a reference to a scene from the television series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. He had used the same reference in an article published in &quot;The Sun&quot; in December 2018 to defend Meghan:
 In his other columns, Clarkson criticised Meghan for her &quot;simpering victimhood&quot;, called her a &quot;silly little cable TV actress&quot;, and stated that her climate change pleas make him want to &quot;shoot a polar bear in the middle of its face.&quot; The Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) said it had received more than 25,100 complaints about the piece, making it the article with the most number of complaints attached to it since IPSO&#x27;s establishment in 2014. The number is also more than the total number of complaints made to IPSO in 2021, which was 14,355.

On 19 December 2022, &quot;The Sun&quot;″s website published a statement in response to the criticism: &quot;In light of Jeremy Clarkson&#x27;s tweet he has asked us to take last week&#x27;s column down.&quot; In light of the controversy, Edward Faulks, the chair of IPSO, declined a private dinner invitation by Rupert Murdoch, who owns &quot;The Sun&quot;. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, whose name was also mentioned in the column, described Clarkson&#x27;s comments as &quot;deeply misogynist and just downright awful and horrible&quot; and warned that &quot;words have consequences&quot;. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, responded to the controversy by emphasising that &quot;language matters&quot;. In a letter to ITV chief executive Carolyn McCall, SNP MP John Nicolson called on the organisation to sack Clarkson.

On 20 December 2022, Conservative MP Caroline Nokes wrote to &quot;The Sun&quot;″s editor, Victoria Newton, calling for &quot;action [to be] taken&quot; against Clarkson and for an &quot;unreserved apology&quot;. The letter was signed by more than 60 cross-party MPs. On 21 December, Kevin Lygo, the managing director of ITV, stated at a Broadcasting Press Guild event that Clarkson would remain host of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; &quot;at the moment&quot; as ITV had &quot;no control&quot; over what he said in &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper column, but added that what he wrote &quot;was awful&quot; and &quot;he should apologise&quot; for his comments. On the same day the head of the Metropolitan Police Sir Mark Rowley stated Clarkson would not face criminal proceedings for his actions as it was not the job of officers to &quot;police people&#x27;s ethics&quot; and the police could generally get involved when &quot;things are said that are intended or likely to stir up or incite violence&quot;.

Peter Herbert, the chair of the Society of Black Lawyers, wrote to the Metropolitan Police requesting an investigation under the Public Order Act 1986 as he believed the column promoted racial hatred. The letter was co-signed by the Society of Black Lawyers, Operation Black Vote and Bandung Africa, as well as Lee Jasper, Viv Ahmun, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, and Claudia Webbe. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said &quot;The allegations have been assessed, no offences have been identified, and no further action will be taken.&quot; On 11 January 2023, culture secretary Michelle Donelan described Clarkson&#x27;s comments as &quot;outrageous&quot; but not &quot;illegal&quot; and said that she &quot;wouldn&#x27;t have said what he said and I don&#x27;t align myself with the comments that he made&quot; but &quot;I defend his right to be able to say what he wants&quot; because &quot;that&#x27;s the nature of free speech – of course, that shouldn&#x27;t stray into illegal content or go in certain directions.&quot;

On 19 December Clarkson stated he was &quot;horrified to have caused so much hurt&quot; over his comments, which were also criticised by his daughter Emily. On 23 December, &quot;The Sun&quot; issued an apology, stating &quot;columnists&#x27; opinions are their own&quot; but they &quot;regret the publication of this article&quot; and are &quot;sincerely sorry&quot;. On the following day, a spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex described the apology as &quot;nothing more than a PR stunt&quot; and added that the publication had not contacted Meghan to personally apologise which &quot;shows their intent&quot;. In an Instagram post on 16 January 2023, Clarkson said that he had emailed the Duke and Duchess on Christmas Day 2022 to apologise, saying that his language had been &quot;disgraceful&quot; and he was &quot;profoundly sorry&quot;. A spokesperson for the couple said Clarkson wrote solely to the Duke and the article was not an isolated incident considering &quot;his long-standing pattern of writing articles that spread hate rhetoric, dangerous conspiracy theories and misogyny.&quot;

In the fallout from the comments, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Amazon was likely ending its relationship with Clarkson; however, this report proved to be inaccuarate, as &quot;Clarkson&#x27;s Farm&quot; was later renewed for a fourth season to be broadcast in 2025. In February 2023, IPSO announced that it was launching an investigation about the article, specifically taking forward two groups of complaints, from the Fawcett Society and the Wilde Foundation, which claimed &quot;they were affected by breaches in accuracy, harassment and discrimination.&quot; In June 2023, IPSO concluded that the column was sexist and contained a &quot;pejorative and prejudicial reference&quot; to Meghan&#x27;s sex, but it rejected complaints that the piece was inaccurate, meant to harass her or included discriminatory references on the grounds of race.

==Personal life==
Clarkson married Alex Hall in 1989, but she left him for one of his friends after six months. In May 1993, he married his manager, Frances Cain, daughter of VC recipient Robert Henry Cain, in Fulham. The couple lived in Chipping Norton, in the Cotswolds, with their three children. Clarkson has been described as a member of the Chipping Norton set. Known for buying him car-related gifts, for Christmas 2007 Clarkson&#x27;s second wife bought him a Mercedes-Benz 600. Clarkson and Cain divorced in 2014.

While reviewing the TVR Sagaris in July 2005 for &quot;Top Gear&quot; at the test track, Clarkson slipped two discs in his back due to him excessively oversteering and was forced to stop driving for six months. Clarkson was involved in a protracted legal dispute about access to a &quot;permissive path&quot; across the grounds of his second home, a converted lighthouse, on the Isle of Man between 2005 and 2010, after reports that dogs had attacked and killed sheep on the property. Clarkson and his wife had claimed that four sheep were deliberately killed after being chased into the sea by a dog let off its lead. He lost the dispute after the Isle of Man government held a public inquiry, and he was told to re-open the footpath. The decision was affirmed by the Isle of Man High Court.

Clarkson is a fan of the progressive rock band Genesis and attended the band&#x27;s reunion concert at Twickenham Stadium in 2007. He also provided sleeve notes for the reissue of the album &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; as part of the &quot;Genesis 1970–1975&quot; box set. Clarkson, along with his son, are fans of the football team Chelsea FC. In September 2010, Clarkson was granted a privacy injunction against his first wife to prevent her from publishing claims that their sexual relationship continued after his second marriage (see &quot;AMM v HXW&quot;). He voluntarily lifted the injunction in October 2011, commenting that: &quot;Injunctions don&#x27;t work. You take out an injunction against somebody or some organisation and immediately news of that injunction and the people involved and the story behind the injunction is in a legal-free world on Twitter and the Internet. It&#x27;s pointless.&quot;

Since 2017, Clarkson has been in a relationship with Irish-born former actress and screenplay writer Lisa Hogan, who features in his Amazon Prime series &quot;Clarkson&#x27;s Farm&quot;. 

For his 60th birthday in 2020, Clarkson purchased a Bentley Flying Spur as a present to himself.

On 23 August 2024, Clarkson opened a pub, The Farmer&#x27;s Dog, formerly known as The Windmill, in Asthall, near Burford, in connection to his farming show &quot;Clarkson&#x27;s Farm&quot;. Clarkson later said he had banned Prime Minister Keir Starmer, his &quot;Top Gear&quot; and &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; colleague James May and a local named Maddy Hornby.

===Health===
On 4 August 2017, he was admitted to hospital after falling ill with pneumonia while on a family holiday in Majorca, Spain, and was being treated in a hospital there. He subsequently said he could &quot;breathe out harder and for longer than a non-smoking 40-year-old&quot; and had 96 per cent capacity for a person his age. &quot;In short, getting on for three-quarters of a million fags have not harmed me in any way. I have quite literally defied medical science&quot;. 

On 19 October 2024, Clarkson revealed via his column on &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; that he had a stent fitted at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford after experiencing a &quot;sudden deterioration&quot; in his health after returning from holiday in the Indian Ocean.

<text>Eamon Delaney (born 14 July 1962) is an Irish newspaper columnist, author, editor, novelist, journalist and former diplomat. According to the Irish Independent, Delaney&#x27;s best-selling memoir of life as an Irish diplomat &quot;ruffled feathers&quot; within the Irish diplomatic corps.

==Education and career==

Delaney attended University College Dublin (UCD). He was Auditor of the Literary and Historical Society from 1985 to 1986. He served Ireland as a diplomat from 1987 until 1995.

After leaving the diplomatic corps, he became a full-time author. His first novel, &quot;The Casting of Mr. O&#x27;Shaughnessy&quot; was published in 1995, and republished in 2002. The eponymous character of Mr O&#x27;Shaughnessy was, in the author&#x27;s own words, &quot;partly, but quite obviously, based on the career of the colourful Seán MacBride&quot;.

His next book, an account of his eight years as a diplomat, &quot;An Accidental Diplomat: My Years in the Irish Foreign Service 1987–1995&quot; was widely discussed. Irish journalist Thomas O&#x27;Dwyer describes Delaney&#x27;s wit as &quot;wicked&quot; and his 2001 book &quot;An Accidental Diplomat&quot; as having been, &quot;a runaway bestseller.&quot; Delaney writes for the Irish Independent, and on an occasional basis for The Irish Times and other outlets.

In 2004 Delaney was named editor of the Dublin news and opinion magazine, &quot;Magill Magazine&quot;, a position that continued until its closure in 2009.

In 2009 Delaney published a book focusing on the life of his late father, the sculptor Edward Delaney entitled &quot;Breaking the Mould&quot;.

==O&#x27;Shaughnessy hoax==
In 1986, Delaney applied for a government pension to be granted to Cornelius O&#x27;Shaughnessy, fictional hero of Delaney&#x27;s later novel &quot;The Casting of Mr. O&#x27;Shaughnessy,&quot; on the basis of the character&#x27;s participation in the 1921 Irish War of Independence. Singer Gavin Friday lent Delaney the name and service details of his own grandfather, an actual veteran of 1921, to serve as the fictional O&#x27;Shaughnessy&#x27;s commanding officer in the application. Delaney cited sufficient plausible historic detail in the application which attracted the personal attention of Taoiseach Charles Haughey. Haughey asked Secretary of Defense Michael J. Noonan to review the case, and three months later the government sent Delaney the appropriate service medals and approved the pension. Delaney revealed the hoax before the pension was actually paid.

==Accidental Diplomat==
According to The Times of London, Delaney&#x27;s &quot;Accidental Diplomat,&quot; &quot;lifted the lid on the internal workings of the Department of Foreign Affairs.&quot; The book was serialised in The Sunday Times which described Delaney as &quot;spilling the diplomatic beans.&quot;

According to the Irish Times, Delaney&#x27;s memoir was a &quot;surprise bestseller.&quot;

==Columnist==

In 2011, a Delaney column in the Sunday Independent in which he argued that the gay rights movement is &quot;overreaching&quot; in seeking the &quot;right to marry, to adopt children, and to intimidate opponents into silence,&quot; touched off a media flap. Those who criticised Delaney&#x27;s column included actor Charlie Condou writing in The Guardian.

==Personal life==
Delaney is married, with children.
