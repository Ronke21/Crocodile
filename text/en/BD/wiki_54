<text>Glareolidae is a family of birds in the wader suborder Lari. It contains two distinct groups, the pratincoles and the coursers. The atypical Egyptian plover (&quot;Pluvianus aegyptius&quot;), traditionally placed in this family, is now known to be only distantly related (basal of clade Charadrii).

The family contains 17 species in 4 genera.

==Description==
The feature that defines the family from the rest of the order is the bill, which is arched and has the nostrils at the base. 
The pratincoles have short legs, long pointed wings and long forked tails. They have a buoyant flight that allows them the unusual (for the order) hunting technique of taking their insect prey on the wing like swallows. The wings also allow for long migrations in some species.
The coursers have long legs, which are used to run (giving the group its name). The wings are shorter and have a more sustained flight than that of the pratincoles.

==Distribution and habitat==
The pratincoles and coursers have an Old World distribution, occurring in southern Europe, Asia, Africa (including Madagascar), and Australia. The family is thought to have evolved in Africa, which is where the family achieves its greatest diversity, although fossils of the genus &quot;Glareola&quot; belonging to an extinct species &quot;Glareola neogena&quot; are known from the Middle Miocene of Europe, while of similar age is of the extinct &quot;Mioglareola gregaria&quot; also from European deposits. The older glareolid fossils are of the genus &quot;Paractiornis&quot; from the Lower Miocene of North America.

The fossil genera and species are:
*&quot;Boutersemia belgica&quot; G. Mayr and R. Smith, 2001 Early Oligocene of Belgium
*&quot;Boutersemia parvula&quot; G. Mayr and R. Smith, 2001 Early Oligocene of Belgium
*&quot;Paractiornis perpusillus&quot; Wetmore, 1930 Early Miocene of Nebraska
*&quot;Mioglareola dolnicensis&quot; (Švec, 1980) Early Miocene of the Czech Republic
*&quot;Mioglareola gregaria&quot; Ballmann, 1979 Early Miocene of the Czech Republic and Middle Miocene of Germany
*&quot;Glareola neogena&quot; Ballmann, 1979 Middle Miocene of Germany
*&quot;&quot;Gallinago&quot; veterior&quot; Jánossy, 1979 Early Pliocene of Hungary
The coursers are typically found in open and arid environments such as deserts and scrub. The three-banded courser and bronze-winged courser are exceptions, being found in woodland and usually away from open land. The subfamily is usually also associated with lowland areas, although the Burchell&#x27;s courser is found in southern Africa&#x27;s Afro-alpine areas. The pratincoles are associated with wetlands, rivers, estuaries and other inland waterways. As with the coursers there are exceptions, particularly the black-winged pratincole which breeds and feeds on open steppes.

Some species of pratincole are long-distance migrants. Shorter migrations include those of the Madagascar pratincole, which migrates from its breeding grounds in Madagascar to East Africa; in contrast the black-winged pratincole migrates from the steppes of Eastern Europe and Central Asia to West and Southern Africa. The migration, which can measure in distance, is often undertaken as a single non-stop flight and is flown at high altitude. The coursers are not particularly migratory, although the cream-colored courser does migrate from the northern extremes of its range in the winter. The coursers are fairly nomadic, but do not undertake long-distance migrations.

==Behaviour==
The coursers are crepuscular and nocturnal in their habits, and are generally inconspicuous, particularly the woodland species. They are not as social as the highly gregarious and noisy pratincoles, some species of which may also be active at dawn and dusk.

===Diet and feeding===
Insects form the majority of the diet of the Glareolidae. The pratincoles forage mainly on the wing, but are able to take prey on the ground as well. They are opportunistic, and have been recorded attending herds of antelope to snatch insects flushed up by their movement, or even insects attracted to street lights. Swarming insects, such as locusts or termites, are particularly targeted. Coursers are exclusively terrestrial, and feed in a plover-like fashion, running, then stopping to scan for prey before moving on. Some species may dig for insects in soft soil with their bills. In addition to insects, coursers may also take molluscs and some seeds.

<doc id="263380" wikidata="Q2393790" url="?curid=263380" title="Homosexuality and psychology">
<text>The field of psychology has extensively studied homosexuality as a human sexual orientation. The American Psychiatric Association listed homosexuality in the DSM-I in 1952 as a &quot;sociopathic personality disturbance,&quot; but that classification came under scrutiny in research funded by the National Institute of Mental Health. That research and subsequent studies consistently failed to produce any empirical or scientific basis for regarding homosexuality as anything other than a natural and normal sexual orientation that is a healthy and positive expression of human sexuality. As a result of this scientific research, the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from the DSM-II in 1973. Upon a thorough review of the scientific data, the American Psychological Association followed in 1975 and also called on all mental health professionals to take the lead in &quot;removing the stigma of mental illness that has long been associated&quot; with homosexuality. In 1993, the National Association of Social Workers adopted the same position as the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association, in recognition of scientific evidence. The World Health Organization, which listed homosexuality in the ICD-9 in 1977, removed homosexuality from the ICD-10 which was endorsed by the 43rd World Health Assembly on 17 May 1990.

The consensus of scientific research and clinical literature demonstrate that same-sex attractions, feelings, and behaviors are normal and positive variations of human sexuality. There is now a large body of scientific evidence that indicates that being gay, lesbian, or bisexual is compatible with normal mental health and social adjustment.

==Historical background==
The view of homosexuality as a psychological disorder has been seen in literature since research on homosexuality first began; however, psychology as a discipline has evolved over the years in its position on homosexuality. Current attitudes have their roots in religious, legal, and cultural underpinnings. Some Ancient Near Eastern communities, such as the Israelites, had strict codes forbidding homosexual activity, and when Christianity began, it adopted their Jewish predecessors attitudes surrounding homosexual activities. Among the New Testament authors Paul in particular is notable for his affirmation and reinforcement of such texts in his letters to nascent churches. Later, the Apostolic Fathers and their successors continued to speak against homosexual activity whenever they mentioned it in their writings. In the early Middle Ages the Christian Church ignored homosexuality in secular society; however, by the end of the 12th century, hostility towards homosexuality began to emerge and spread through Europe&#x27;s secular and religious institutions. There were official expressions condemning the &quot;unnatural&quot; nature of homosexual behavior in the works of Thomas Aquinas and others. Until the 19th century, homosexual activity was referred to as &quot;unnatural, crimes against nature&quot;, &quot;sodomy&quot; or &quot;buggery&quot; and was punishable by law, sometimes by death.

As people became more interested in discovering the causes of homosexuality, medicine and psychiatry began competing with the law and religion for jurisdiction. In the beginning of the 19th century, people began studying homosexuality scientifically. At this time, most theories regarded homosexuality as a disease, which had a great influence on how it was viewed culturally. There was a paradigm shift in the mid 20th century in psychiatric science in regards to theories of homosexuality. Psychiatrists began to believe homosexuality could be cured through therapy and freedom of self, and other theories about the genetic and hormonal origin of homosexuality were becoming accepted. There were variations of how homosexuality was viewed as pathological. Some early psychiatrists such as Sigmund Freud and Havelock Ellis adopted more tolerant stances on homosexuality. Freud and Ellis believed that homosexuality was not normal, but was &quot;unavoidable&quot; for some people. Alfred Kinsey&#x27;s research and publications about homosexuality began the social and cultural shift away from viewing homosexuality as an abnormal condition. These shifting viewpoints in the psychological studies of homosexuality are evident in its placement in the first version of the &quot;Diagnostic Statistical Manual&quot; (DSM) in 1952, and subsequent change in 1973, in which the diagnosis of ego-dystonic homosexuality replaced the DSM-II category of &quot;sexual orientation disturbance&quot;. However, it was not until 1987 in DSM-III-R that it was entirely dropped as a mental disorder.

A 2016 survey of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights found that many medical professionals in countries such as Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Romania and Slovakia believe that homosexuality is a disease and that such interpretations continue to exist in professional materials. This goes against Council of Europe Recommendation 2010(5) which recommends that homosexuality not be treated as a disease. As of 2018, homosexuality was popularly considered a disease in Lebanon.

===Freud and psychoanalysis===
Sigmund Freud&#x27;s views on homosexuality were complex. In his attempts to understand the causes and development of homosexuality, he first explained bisexuality as an &quot;original libido endowment&quot;, by which he meant that all humans are born bisexual. He believed that the libido has a homosexual portion and a heterosexual portion, and through the course of development one wins out over the other.

Some other causes of homosexuality for which he advocated included an inverted Oedipus complex where individuals begin to identify with their mother and take themselves as a love object. This love of one&#x27;s self is defined as narcissism, and Freud thought that people who were high in the trait of narcissism would be more likely to develop homosexuality because loving the same sex is like an extension of loving oneself.

Freud believed treatment of homosexuality was not successful because the individual does not want to give up their homosexual identity because it brings them pleasure. He used psychoanalysis and hypnotic suggestion as treatments, but showed little success. It was through this that Freud arrived at the conclusion that homosexuality was &quot;nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation, it cannot be classified as an illness, but a variation of sexual function&quot;. He further stated that psychoanalysts &quot;should not promise to abolish homosexuality and make normal heterosexuality take its place&quot;, as he had concluded in his own practice that attempts to change homosexual orientations were likely to be unsuccessful. While Freud himself may have come to a more accepting view of homosexuality, his legacy in the field of psychoanalysis, especially in the United States viewed homosexuality as negative, abnormal and caused by family and developmental issues. It was these views that significantly impacted the rationale for putting homosexuality in the first and second publications of the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s DSM, conceptualizing it as a mental disorder and further stigmatizing homosexuality in society.

===Havelock Ellis===

Havelock Ellis (1859–1939) was working as a teacher in Australia, when he had a revelation that he wanted to dedicate his life to exploring the issue of sexuality. He returned to London in 1879 and enrolled in St. Thomas&#x27;s Hospital Medical School. He began to write, and in 1896 he co-authored &quot;Sexual Inversion&quot; with John Addington Symonds. The book was first published in German, and a year later it was translated into English. Their book explored homosexual relationships, and in a progressive approach for their time they refused to criminalize or pathologize the acts and emotions that were present in homosexual relationships.

Ellis disagreed with Freud on a few points regarding homosexuality, especially regarding its development. He argued that homosexuals do not have a clear cut Oedipus complex but they do have strong feelings of inadequacy, born of fears of failure, and may also be afraid of relations with women. Ellis argued that the restrictions of society contributed to the development of same-sex love. He believed that homosexuality is not something people are born with, but that at some point humans are all sexually indiscriminate, and then narrow down and choose which sex acts to stick with. According to Ellis, some people choose to engage in homosexuality, while others will choose heterosexuality. He proposed that being &quot;exclusively homosexual&quot; is to be deviant because the person is a member of a minority and therefore statistically unusual, but that society should accept that deviations from the &quot;normal&quot; were harmless, and maybe even valuable. Ellis believed that psychological problems arose not from homosexual acts alone, but when someone &quot;psychologically harms himself by fearfully limiting his own sex behavior&quot;.

Ellis is often credited with coining the term &quot;homosexuality&quot; but in reality he despised the word because it conflated Latin and Greek roots and instead used the term &quot;invert&quot; in his published works. Soon after &quot;Sexual Inversion&quot; was published in England, it was banned as lewd and scandalous. Ellis argued that homosexuality was a characteristic of a minority, and was not acquired or a vice and was not curable. He advocated changing the laws to leave those who chose to practice homosexuality at peace, because at the time it was a punishable crime. He believed societal reform could occur, but only after the public was educated. His book became a landmark in the understanding of homosexuality.

===Alfred Kinsey===

Alfred Charles Kinsey (1894–1956) was a sexologist who founded the Institute for Sex Research, which is now known as the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction. His explorations into different sexual practices originated from his study of the variations in mating practices among wasps. He developed the Kinsey Scale, which measures sexual orientation in ranges from 0 to 6 with 0 being exclusively heterosexual and 6 being exclusively homosexual. His findings indicated that there was great variability in sexual orientations. Kinsey published the books &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male&quot; and &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Female&quot;, which brought him both fame and controversy. The prevailing approach to homosexuality at the time was to pathologize and attempt to change homosexuals. Kinsey&#x27;s book demonstrated that homosexuality was more common than was assumed, suggesting that these behaviors are normal and part of a continuum of sexual behaviors.

===The &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual&quot;===
The social, medical, and legal approach to homosexuality ultimately led to its inclusion in the first and second publications of the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual&quot; (DSM). This served to conceptualize homosexuality as a mental disorder and further stigmatize homosexuality in society. However, the evolution in scientific study and empirical data from Kinsey, Evelyn Hooker, and others confronted these beliefs, and by the 1970s psychiatrists and psychologists were radically altering their views on homosexuality. Tests such as the Rorschach, Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) indicated that homosexual men and women were not distinguishable from heterosexual men and women in functioning. These studies failed to support the previous assumptions that family dynamics, trauma, and gender identity were factors in the development of sexual orientation. Many psychologists have differing opinions about same-sex relationships. Some think that it is not healthy at all, some support it, and some cannot support it because of their own personal religious beliefs. Due to lack of supporting data, as well as exponentially increasing pressure from gay rights advocates, the board of directors for the American Psychiatric Association voted to declassify homosexuality as a mental disorder from the DSM-II in 1973, but the DSM retained a diagnosis that could be used for distress due to one&#x27;s sexual orientation until the DSM-5 (2013).

==Major areas of psychological research==
Major psychological research into homosexuality is divided into five categories:
# What causes some people to be attracted to his or her own sex?
# What causes discrimination against people with a homosexual orientation and how can this be influenced?
# Does having a homosexual orientation affect one&#x27;s health status, psychological functioning or general well-being?
# What determines successful adaptation to rejecting social climates? Why is homosexuality central to the identity of some people, but peripheral to the identity of others?
# How do the children of homosexual people develop?

Psychological research in these areas has always been important to counteracting prejudicial attitudes and actions, and to the gay and lesbian rights movement generally.

===Causes of homosexuality===
Although no single theory on the cause of sexual orientation has yet gained widespread support, scientists favor biologically based theories. There is considerably more evidence supporting nonsocial, biological causes of sexual orientation than social ones, especially for males.

===Discrimination===

Anti-gay attitudes and behaviors (sometimes called &quot;homophobia&quot; or &quot;heterosexism&quot;) have been objects of psychological research. Such research usually focuses on attitudes hostile to gay men, rather than attitudes hostile to lesbians. Anti-gay attitudes are often found in those who do not know gay people on a personal basis. There is also a high risk for anti-gay bias in psychotherapy with lesbian, gay, and bisexual clients. One study found that nearly half of its sample had been the victim of verbal or physical violence because of their sexual orientation, usually committed by men. Such victimization is related to higher levels of depression, anxiety, anger, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Through the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, which was conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality, transgender people of color were found to face disproportionate discrimination because of their overlapping identities. These forms of discrimination included violence, unreasonable unemployment, unfair policing, and unfair medical treatment.

Research suggests that parents who respond negatively to their child&#x27;s sexual orientation tended to have lower self-esteem and negative attitudes toward women, and that &quot;negative feelings about homosexuality in parents - decreased the longer they were aware of their child&#x27;s homosexuality&quot;.

In addition, while research has suggested that &quot;families with a strong emphasis on traditional values implying the importance of religion, an emphasis on marriage and having children – were less accepting of homosexuality than were low-tradition families&quot;, emerging research suggests that this may not be universal. For example, recent research published in APA&#x27;s &quot;Psychology of Religion &amp; Spirituality&quot; journal by Chana Etengoff and Colette Daiute suggests that religious family members can alternatively use religious values and texts in support of their sexual minority relative. For example, a Catholic mother of a gay man shared that she focuses on &quot;the greatest commandment of all, which is, love&quot;. Similarly, a Methodist mother referenced Jesus in her discussion of loving her gay son, as she said, &quot;I look at Jesus&#x27; message of love and forgiveness and that we&#x27;re friends by the blood, that I don&#x27;t feel that people are condemned by the actions they have done.&quot; These religious values were similarly expressed by a father who is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who shared the following during his discussion of the biblical prohibition against homosexuality: &quot;Your goal, your reason for being, should be to accept and to love and to lift up ... those in need no matter who they are&quot;.

===Mental health issues===
Psychological research in this area includes examining mental health issues (including stress, depression, or addictive behavior) faced by gay and lesbian people as a result of the difficulties they experience because of their sexual orientation, physical appearance issues, eating disorders, or gender atypical behavior.
* Psychiatric disorders: in a Dutch study, gay men reported significantly higher rates of mood and anxiety disorders than straight men, and lesbians were significantly more likely to experience depression (but not other mood or anxiety disorders) than straight women. A research paper from the &quot;American Journal of Community Psychology&quot; states that individuals who face multiple forms of oppression tend to find their hardships more difficult to manage. In this study, it is noted that LGBTQ+ people who are disabled have reported struggling more with their oppressed statuses.
* Physical appearance and eating disorders: gay men tend to be more concerned about their physical appearance than straight men. Lesbian women are at a lower risk for eating disorders than heterosexual women.
* Gender atypical behavior: while this is not a disorder, gay men may face difficulties due to being more likely to display gender atypical behavior than heterosexual men. The difference is less pronounced between lesbians and straight women.
* Minority stress: stress caused from a sexual stigma, manifested as prejudice and discrimination, is a major source of stress for people with a homosexual orientation. Sexual-minority affirming groups and gay peer groups help counteract and buffer minority stress.
* Ego-dystonic sexual orientation: conflict between religious identity and sexual orientation can cause severe stress, causing some people to want to change their sexual orientation. Sexual orientation identity exploration can help individuals evaluate the reasons behind the desire to change and help them resolve the conflict between their religious and sexual identity, either through sexual orientation identity reconstruction or affirmation therapies. Ego-dystonic sexual orientation is a disorder where a person wishes their sexual orientation were different because of associated psychological and behavioral disorders.
* Sexual relationship disorder: people with a homosexual orientation in mixed-orientation marriages may struggle with the fear of the loss of their marriage. Sexual relationship disorder is a disorder where the gender identity or sexual orientation of one of the partners interferes with maintaining or forming of a relationship.

====Suicide====
The likelihood of suicide attempts is higher in both gay males and lesbians, as well as bisexual individuals of both sexes, when compared to their heterosexual counterparts. The trend of having a higher incident rate among females encompasses lesbians or bisexual females; when compared with homosexual or bisexual males, lesbians are more likely to attempt suicide.

Studies dispute the exact difference in suicide rate compared to heterosexuals with a minimum of 0.8–1.1 times more likely for females and 1.5–2.5 times more likely for males. The higher figures reach 4.6 times more likely in females and 14.6 times more likely in males.

Race and age play a factor in the increased risk. The highest ratios for males are attributed to young Caucasians. By the age of 25, their risk is more than halved; however, the risk for black gay males at that age steadily increases to 8.6 times more likely. Over a lifetime, the increased likelihoods are 5.7 times for white and 12.8 for black gay and bisexual males. Lesbian and bisexual females have the opposite trend, with fewer attempts during the teenager years compared to heterosexual females. Through a lifetime, the likelihood for Caucasian females is nearly triple that of their heterosexual counterparts; however, for black females there is minimal change (less than 0.1 to 0.3 difference), with heterosexual black females having a slightly higher risk throughout most of the age-based study.

Gay and lesbian youth who attempt suicide are disproportionately subject to anti-gay attitudes, often have fewer skills for coping with discrimination, isolation, and loneliness, and were more likely to experience family rejection than those who do not attempt suicide. Another study found that gay and bisexual youth who attempted suicide had more feminine gender roles, adopted a non-heterosexual identity at a young age and were more likely than peers to report sexual abuse, drug abuse, and arrests for misconduct. One study found that same-sex sexual behavior, but not homosexual attraction or homosexual identity, was significantly predictive of suicide among Norwegian adolescents.

Government policies have been found to mediate this relationship by legislating structural stigma. One study using cross-country data from 1991 to 2017 for 36 OECD countries established that same-sex marriage legalization is associated with a decline in youth suicide of 1.191 deaths per 100,000 youth, with the impact more pronounced for male youth relative to female youth. Another study of nationwide data from across the United States from January 1999 to December 2015 revealed that same-sex marriage is associated with a significant reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children, with the effect being concentrated among children of a minority sexual orientation, resulting in about 134,000 fewer children attempting suicide each year in the United States.

===Sexual orientation identity development===

* Coming out: many gay, lesbian and bisexual people go through a &quot;coming out&quot; experience at some point in their lives. Psychologists often say this process includes several stages &quot;in which there is an awareness of being different from peers (&#x27;sensitization&#x27;), and in which people start to question their sexual identity (&#x27;identity confusion&#x27;). Subsequently, they start to explore practically the option of being gay, lesbian or bisexual and learn to deal with the stigma (&#x27;identity assumption&#x27;). In the final stage, they integrate their sexual desires into a positive understanding of self (&#x27;commitment&#x27;).&quot; However, the process is not always linear and it may differ for lesbians, gay men and bisexual individuals.
* Different degrees of coming out: one study found that gay men are more likely to be out to friends and siblings than to co-workers, parents, and more distant relatives.
* Coming out and well-being: same-sex couples who are openly gay are more satisfied in their relationships. For women who self-identify as lesbian, the more people know about her sexual orientation, the less anxiety, more positive affectivity, and greater self-esteem she has.
* Rejection of gay identity: various studies report that for some religious people, rejecting a gay identity appears to relieve the distress caused by conflicts between religious values and sexual orientation. After reviewing the research, Judith Glassgold, chair of the American Psychological Association sexuality task force, said some people are content in denying a gay identity and &quot;there is no clear evidence of harm&quot;.

===Fluidity of sexual orientation===
Often, sexual orientation and sexual orientation identity are not distinguished, which can impact accurately assessing sexual identity and whether or not sexual orientation is able to change; sexual orientation identity can change throughout an individual&#x27;s life, and may or may not align with biological sex, sexual behavior or actual sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Concordance/discordance in SO&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual orientation is stable and unlikely to change for the vast majority of people, but some research indicates that some people may experience change in their sexual orientation, and this is more likely for women than for men. The American Psychological Association distinguishes between sexual orientation (an innate attraction) and sexual orientation identity (which may change at any point in a person&#x27;s life).

In a statement issued jointly with other major American medical organizations, the American Psychological Association states that &quot;different people realize at different points in their lives that they are heterosexual, gay, lesbian, or bisexual&quot;. A 2007 report from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health states that, &quot;For some people, sexual orientation is continuous and fixed throughout their lives. For others, sexual orientation may be fluid and change over time&quot;. Lisa Diamond&#x27;s study &quot;Female bisexuality from adolescence to adulthood&quot; suggests that there is &quot;considerable fluidity in bisexual, unlabeled, and lesbian women&#x27;s attractions, behaviors, and identities&quot;.

===Parenting===

LGBT parenting is the parenting of children by lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, as either biological or non-biological parents. Gay men have options which include &quot;foster care, variations of domestic and international adoption, diverse forms of surrogacy (whether &quot;traditional&quot; or gestational), and kinship arrangements, wherein they might coparent with a woman or women with whom they are intimately but not sexually involved&quot;. LGBT parents can also include single parents; to a lesser extent, the term sometimes refers to parents of LGBT children.

In the 2000 U.S. Census, 33% of female same-sex couple households and 22% of male same-sex couple households reported at least one child under eighteen living in their home. Some children do not know they have an LGBT parent; coming out issues vary and some parents may never come out to their children. Adoption by LGBT couples and LGBT parenting in general may be controversial in some countries. In January 2008, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that same-sex couples have the right to adopt a child. In the U.S., LGBT people can legally adopt, as individuals, in all fifty states.

Although it is sometimes asserted in policy debates that heterosexual couples are inherently better parents than same-sex couples, or that the children of lesbian or gay parents fare worse than children raised by heterosexual parents, those assertions are not supported by scientific research literature. There is ample evidence to show that children raised by same-gender parents fare as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. Much research has documented the lack of correlation between parents&#x27; sexual orientation and any measure of a child&#x27;s emotional, psychosocial, and behavioral adjustment. These data have demonstrated no risk to children as a result of growing up in a family with one or more gay parents. No research supports the widely held conviction that the gender of parents influences the well-being of the child. If gay, lesbian, or bisexual parents were inherently less capable than otherwise comparable heterosexual parents, their children would present more poorly regardless of the type of sample; this pattern has not been observed.

Professor Judith Stacey of New York University, stated: &quot;Rarely is there as much consensus in any area of social science as in the case of gay parenting, which is why the American Academy of Pediatrics and all of the major professional organizations with expertise in child welfare have issued reports and resolutions in support of gay and lesbian parental rights&quot;. These organizations include the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Psychoanalytic Association, the National Association of Social Workers, the Child Welfare League of America, the North American Council on Adoptable Children, and the Canadian Psychological Association (CPA). The CPA is concerned that some persons and institutions are misinterpreting the findings of psychological research to support their positions, when their positions are more accurately based on other systems of belief or values.

The vast majority of families in the United States today are not the &quot;middle-class family with a bread-winning father and a stay-at-home mother, married to each other and raising their biological children&quot; that has been viewed as the norm. Since the end of the 1980s, it has been well established that children and adolescents can adjust just as well in nontraditional settings as in traditional settings.

==Psychotherapy==
Most people with a homosexual orientation who seek psychotherapy do so for the same reasons as straight people (stress, relationship difficulties, difficulty adjusting to social or work situations, etc.); their sexual orientation may be of primary, incidental, or no importance to their issues and treatment. Regardless of the issue for which psychotherapy is sought, there is a high risk of anti-gay bias being directed at non-heterosexual clients.

===Relationship counseling===

Most relationship issues are shared equally among couples regardless of sexual orientation, but LGBT clients additionally have to deal with homophobia, heterosexism, and other societal oppressions. Individuals may also be at different stages in the coming out process. Often, same-sex couples do not have as many role models for successful relationships as opposite-sex couples. There may be issues with gender-role socialization that does not affect opposite-sex couples.

A significant number of men and women experience conflict surrounding homosexual expression within a mixed-orientation marriage. Therapy may include helping the client feel more comfortable and accepting of same-sex feelings and to explore ways of incorporating same-sex and opposite-sex feelings into life patterns. Although a strong homosexual identity was associated with difficulties in marital satisfaction, viewing the same-sex activities as compulsive facilitated commitment to the marriage and to monogamy.

===Gay affirmative psychotherapy===

Gay affirmative psychotherapy is a form of psychotherapy for gay, lesbian, and bisexual clients which encourages them to accept their sexual orientation, and does not attempt to change their sexual orientation to heterosexual, or to eliminate or diminish their same-sex desires and behaviors. The American Psychological Association (APA) and the British Psychological Society offer guidelines and materials for gay affirmative psychotherapy. Practitioners of gay affirmative psychotherapy state that homosexuality or bisexuality is not a mental illness, and that embracing and affirming gay identity can be a key component to recovery from other mental illnesses or substance abuse. Some people may find neither gay affirmative therapy nor conversion therapy appropriate, however. Clients whose religious beliefs are inconsistent with homosexual behavior may require some other method of integrating their conflicting religious and sexual selves.

===Sexual orientation identity exploration===

The American Psychological Association recommends that if a client wants treatment to change their sexual orientation, the therapist should explore the reasons behind the desire, without favoring any particular outcome. The therapist should neither promote nor reject the idea of celibacy, but help the client come to their own decisions by evaluating the reasons behind the patient&#x27;s goals. One example of sexual orientation identity exploration is sexual identity therapy.

After exploration, a patient may proceed with sexual orientation identity reconstruction, which helps a patient reconstruct sexual orientation identity. Psychotherapy, support groups, and life events can influence identity development; similarly, self-awareness, self-conception, and identity may evolve during treatment. It can change sexual orientation identity (private and public identification, and group belonging), emotional adjustment (self-stigma and shame reduction), and personal beliefs, values and norms (change of religious and moral belief, behavior and motivation). Some therapies include &quot;gender wholeness therapy&quot;.

The American Psychiatric Association states in their official statement release on the matter: &quot;The potential risks of &#x27;reparative therapy&#x27; are great and include depression, anxiety, and self-destructive behavior, since therapist alignment with societal prejudices against homosexuality may reinforce self-hatred already experienced by the patient. Many patients who have undergone &#x27;reparative therapy&#x27; relate that they were inaccurately told that homosexuals are lonely, unhappy individuals who never achieve acceptance or satisfaction. The possibility that the person might achieve happiness and satisfying interpersonal relationships as a gay man or lesbian are not presented, nor are alternative approaches to dealing with the effects of societal stigmatization discussed. APA recognizes that in the course of ongoing psychiatric treatment, there may be appropriate clinical indications for attempting to change sexual behaviors.&quot;

The American Psychological Association aligns with this in a resolution: it &quot;urges all mental health professionals to take the lead in removing the stigma of mental illness that has long been associated with homosexual orientation&quot; and &quot;Therefore be it further resolved that the American Psychological Association opposes portrayals of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth and adults as mentally ill due to their sexual orientation and supports the dissemination of accurate information about sexual orientation, and mental health, and appropriate interventions in order to counteract bias that is based in ignorance or unfounded beliefs about sexual orientation.&quot;

The American Academy of Pediatrics advises lesbian, gay, gynandromorphophilic, and bisexual teenagers struggling with their sexuality: &quot;Homosexuality is not a mental disorder. All of the major medical organizations, including The American Psychiatric Association, The American Psychological Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics agree that homosexuality is not an illness or disorder, but a form of sexual expression. No one knows what causes a person to be gay, bisexual, or straight. There probably are a number of factors. Some may be biological. Others may be psychological. The reasons can vary from one person to another. The fact is, you do not choose to be gay, bisexual, or straight.&quot;

==Developments in individual psychology==
In contemporary Adlerian thought, homosexuals are not considered within the problematic discourse of the &quot;failures of life&quot;. Christopher Shelley, an Adlerian psychotherapist, published a volume of essays in 1998 that feature Freudian, (post)Jungian and Adlerian contributions that demonstrate affirmative shifts in the depth psychologies. These shifts show how depth psychology can be utilized to support rather than pathologize gay and lesbian psychotherapy clients. The &quot;Journal of Individual Psychology&quot;, the English language flagship publication of Adlerian psychology, released a volume in the summer of 2008 that reviews and corrects Adler&#x27;s previously held beliefs on the homosexual community.

<doc id="263381" wikidata="Q1049690" url="?curid=263381" title="Slappy">
<text>Slappy is the second EP by American rock band Green Day. It was released in 1990 through Lookout! Records. Upon its release, several different colors of vinyl were available in limited quantities. Frontman and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong cited the extended play as the one on which Green Day began to find its sound. The dog on the cover was known as Mickey. &quot;Slappy&quot; was a nickname given to him by bassist Mike Dirnt&#x27;s friend Jason Relva (the subject of Green Day&#x27;s later song J.A.R.). The EP includes one cover, &quot;Knowledge&quot;, which was originally by influential California punk band Operation Ivy. All four tracks were later included on the compilation album &quot;1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours&quot; in 1991.

==Liner notes==
Recorded in a few hours on April 20, 1990, at Art of Ears Studio with Andro Engineering and mixed April 23 in a few more hours. Produced by Andro and Green Day. Mastered by John Golden at K-Disc, Hollywood. Front cover photo by Al Sobrante, back Sean Hughes Layout and &quot;Green Day Bitz&quot; by Aaron Cometbus. Green Day&#x27;s &quot;39/Smooth&quot; L.P. and &quot;1,000 Hours&quot; E.P. were also available on Lookout.

==Album information==
&quot;Paper Lanterns&quot; was a popular Green Day song and a live staple for many years and was brought back for the 2010 leg of the 21st Century Breakdown World Tour. &quot;Why Do You Want Him?&quot; was the first song Armstrong wrote,&lt;ref name=&quot;1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours liner notes&quot;&gt;Green Day Bits, &quot;1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours&quot; liner notes. Retrieved 2011-07-30&lt;/ref&gt; back when he was fourteen. He expressed in a 2010 interview that contrary to the common belief, the song is not about his stepfather. The title &quot;409 in Your Coffeemaker&quot; is taken from a prank Armstrong pulled on his teacher. The prank was that he put some Clorox cleaner in his teacher’s coffeemaker, and it was known as Formula 409, hence the name of the song. It was later re-recorded during the &quot;Dookie&quot; (1994) sessions, and was released as a B-Side on the &quot;Basket Case&quot; CD single in the United Kingdom. &quot;Knowledge&quot; was originally performed by Operation Ivy for their 1989 album Energy. Green Day still performs the song live, often inviting fans onstage to play the band members&#x27; instruments for them during the performance of the song.

All four tracks from &quot;Slappy&quot; were included on the compilation album &quot;1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours&quot; in 1991. &quot;Slappy&quot; remained in print until August 2005, when Green Day removed its catalog from Lookout! Records.

Since March 24, 2009, &quot;Slappy&quot; (along with &quot;1,000 Hours&quot;) has been back in print as a bonus to the vinyl reissue of the &quot;39/Smooth&quot; (1990) album. However, a possible error may have been made as &quot;Slappy&quot; artwork is now tinted pink instead of dark red.

<doc id="263385" wikidata="Q380356" url="?curid=263385" title="True Cross">
<text>According to Christian tradition, the True Cross is the real cross on which Jesus of Nazareth was crucified. 

It is related by numerous historical accounts and legends that Helen, the mother of Roman emperor Constantine the Great, recovered the True Cross at the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, when she travelled to the Holy Land in the years 326–328. The late fourth-century historians Gelasius of Caesarea and Tyrannius Rufinus wrote that while Helen was there, she discovered the hiding place of three crosses that were believed to have been used at the crucifixion of Jesus and the two thieves, Dismas and Gestas, who were executed with him. To one cross was affixed the titulus bearing Jesus&#x27; name, but according to Rufinus, Helen was unsure of its legitimacy until a miracle revealed that it was the True Cross. This event is celebrated on the liturgical calendar as the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross (Roodmas) by the Oriental Orthodox, Eastern Orthodox, Persian, Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Anglican churches.

The Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox churches, as well as denominations of the Church of the East, have all claimed to possess relics of the True Cross as objects of veneration. Historians generally dispute the authenticity of the relics, as do Protestant and other Christian churches, who do not hold them in high regard.

==Provenance==
===&quot;The Golden Legend&quot;===
In the Latin-speaking traditions of Western Europe, the story of the pre-Christian origins of the True Cross was well established by the 13th century when, in 1260, it was recorded by Jacobus de Voragine, Bishop of Genoa, in the &quot;Golden Legend&quot;.

&quot;The Golden Legend&quot; contains several versions of the origin of the True Cross. In &quot;The Life of Adam&quot;, Voragine writes that the True Cross came from three trees which grew from three seeds from the &quot;Tree of Mercy&quot; which Seth collected and planted in the mouth of Adam&#x27;s corpse.

In another account contained in &quot;Of the Invention of the Holy Cross&quot;, Voragine writes that the True Cross came from a tree that grew from part of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, &quot;the tree that Adam ate of&quot;, that Seth planted on Adam&#x27;s grave where it &quot;endured there unto the time of Solomon&quot;. Alternatively, it reached Solomon via Moses, who used it as the staff of Moses, and David, who planted it at Jerusalem. It was felled by Solomon to be a beam in his temple but not found suitable in the end.

After many centuries, the tree was cut down and the wood used to build a bridge over which the Queen of Sheba passed on her journey to meet Solomon. So struck was she by the portent contained in the timber of the bridge that she fell on her knees and revered it. On her visit to Solomon, she told him that a piece of wood from the bridge would bring about the replacement of God&#x27;s covenant with the Jewish people by a new order. Solomon, fearing the eventual destruction of his people, had the timber buried.

After fourteen generations, the wood taken from the bridge was fashioned into the Cross used to crucify Jesus Christ. Voragine then goes on to describe its rediscovery by Helena, mother of the Emperor Constantine.

In the Late Middle Ages and Early Renaissance, there was wide general acceptance of the account of the cross&#x27;s history as presented by Voragine. This general acceptance is displayed in numerous artworks on the subject, culminating in one of the most famous fresco cycles of the Renaissance, the &quot;Legend of the True Cross&quot; by Piero della Francesca, which he painted on the walls of the chancel of the Church of San Francesco in Arezzo between 1452 and 1466, faithfully reproducing the episodes of &quot;The Golden Legend&quot;.

===Eastern Christianity===
According to the sacred tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Church the True Cross was made from three different types of wood: cedar, pine and cypress. This is an allusion to : &quot;The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box [cypress] together to beautify the place of my sanctuary, and I will make the place of my feet glorious.&quot; The link between this verse and the crucifixion lies in the words &quot;the place of my feet&quot;, which is interpreted as referring to the footrest () on which Jesus&#x27; feet were nailed and which appears on the Orthodox cross. (Compare with the Jewish concepts of the Ark of the Covenant or the Jerusalem Temple as being God&#x27;s footstool, and the prescribed Three Pilgrimage Festivals, in Hebrew &quot;aliya la-regel&quot;, lit. &quot;ascending to the foot&quot;).

===Tradition of Lot&#x27;s triple tree===
A further tradition holds that these three trees from which the True Cross was constructed grew together in one spot. A traditional Orthodox icon in the Monastery of the Cross depicts Lot, the nephew of Abraham, watering the trees. According to tradition, these trees were used to construct the Temple in Jerusalem (&quot;to beautify the place of my sanctuary&quot;). Later, during Herod&#x27;s reconstruction of the Temple, the wood from these trees was removed from the Temple and discarded, eventually being used to construct the cross on which Jesus was crucified (&quot;and I will make the place of my feet glorious&quot;).

==Empress Helena and the Cross==
===Eusebius===
The &quot;Life of Constantine&quot; by Eusebius of Caesarea (died 339) is the earliest and main historical source on the rediscovery of the Tomb of Jesus and the construction of the first church at the site, but does not mention anything concerning the True Cross. Eusebius describes how the site of the Holy Sepulchre, once a site of veneration for the early Christian Church in Jerusalem, had been covered over with earth and a temple of Venus had been built on top. Although Eusebius does not say as much, this would probably have been done as part of Hadrian&#x27;s 130 reconstruction of Jerusalem into the Roman city of Aelia Capitolina, following Jerusalem&#x27;s destruction at the end of the Jewish Revolt in the year 70, and in connection with Bar Kokhba&#x27;s revolt of 132–135. Following his conversion to Christianity, Emperor Constantine ordered in about 325–326 that the site be uncovered and instructed Macarius, Bishop of Jerusalem, to build a church on the site. Eusebius&#x27; work contains details about the demolition of the pagan temple and the erection of the church, but does not mention anywhere the finding of the True Cross.

=== Cyril of Jerusalem ===
Perhaps the earliest witness to the tradition of the True Cross was Cyril, Bishop of Jerusalem (c. 350-386). In the fourth of his Catechetical Lectures, which are dated to around the year 350, he says that &quot;the whole world has since been filled with pieces of the wood of the Cross.&quot; This text relates that pieces of the cross were dispersed as relics, but offers no information about the discovery of the cross itself. Elsewhere, in a letter to Emperor Constantius, Cyril only relates that the cross was found during the reign of Constantine.

=== Gelasius and Rufinus ===
About forty years after Cyril, there was a fully developed story about how the True Cross was discovered. Cyril&#x27;s nephew Gelasius of Caesarea recorded the account in a now lost Greek Ecclesiastical History prior to his death in 395. This version was adapted circa 402 in Rufinus of Aquileia&#x27;s Latin additions to Eusebius&#x27; Church History. In this narrative, Helena went to Jerusalem in search of the relic and was made aware of its location by a heavenly sign. She tore down the temple of Aphrodite that had been built there, and beneath the rubble found three crosses. The cross of Jesus was identified, with the aid of Bishop Macarius of Jerusalem, by its miraculous affecting of a cure for a mortally ill woman. A Church was then built on the spot and the relic was divided, with part staying in Jerusalem and part given to Constantine along with the nails.

===Socrates Scholasticus===

In his &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, nearly a century after Eusebius and forty years after Rufinus, Socrates Scholasticus (died c. 440) gives a description of the discovery later repeated by Sozomen and Theodoret. Socrates&#x27; account is very similar to Rufinus&#x27;. In it he describes how Helena Augusta, Constantine&#x27;s aged mother, had the pagan temple destroyed and the Sepulchre uncovered, whereupon three crosses, the titulus, and the nails from Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion were uncovered as well. In Socrates&#x27;s version of the story, Macarius had the three crosses placed in turn on a deathly ill woman. This woman recovered at the touch of the third cross, which was taken as a sign that this was the cross of Christ, the new Christian symbol. Socrates also reports that, having also found the cross&#x27;s nails, Helena sent these to Constantinople, where they were incorporated into the emperor&#x27;s helmet and the bridle of his horse.

===Sozomen===
In his &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, Sozomen (died ) gives essentially the same version as Socrates. Without further attribution, he also adds that it was said that the location of the Sepulchre was &quot;disclosed by a Hebrew who dwelt in the East and who derived his information from some documents which had come to him by paternal inheritance&quot;although Sozomen himself disputes this accountso that a dead person was also revived by the touch of the Cross. Later popular versions of this story state that the Jew who assisted Helena was named Jude or Judas but later converted to Christianity and took the name Kyriakos.

===Theodoret===

Theodoret (died ) in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; Chapter xvii gives what would become the standard version of the finding of the True Cross:
With the Cross were also found the Holy Nails, which Helena took with her back to Constantinople. According to Theodoret, &quot;She had part of the cross of our Saviour conveyed to the palace. The rest was enclosed in a covering of silver, and committed to the care of the bishop of the city, whom she exhorted to preserve it carefully, in order that it might be transmitted uninjured to posterity.&quot;

===Syriac tradition===
Another popular ancient version from the Syriac tradition replaced Helena with a fictitious first-century empress named Protonike, who is said to be the wife of emperor Claudius. This story, which originated in Edessa in the 430s, was transmitted in the so-called &quot;Doctrina Addai&quot;, which was believed to be written by Thaddeus of Edessa (Addai in Syriac texts), one of the seventy disciples. The narrative retrojected the Helena version to the first century. In the story, Protonike traveled to Jerusalem after she met Simon Peter in Rome. She was shown around the city by James, brother of Jesus, until she discovered the cross after it healed her daughter of some illness. She then converted to Christianity and had a church built on Golgotha. Aside from the Syriac tradition, the Protonike version was also cited by Armenian sources.

===Catholic commemoration===
According to the 1955 Roman Catholic Marian Missal, Helena went to Jerusalem to search for the True Cross and found it 14 September 320. In the 8th century, the Feast of the Finding was transferred to 3 May and 14 September became the celebration of the &quot;Exaltation of the Cross&quot;, the commemoration of a victory over the Persians by the Byzantine emperor Heraclius, as a result of which the relic was recovered and returned to Jerusalem.

==The True Cross in Jerusalem==

===Late antiquity===
The silver reliquary that was left at the Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre in care of the bishop of Jerusalem was exhibited periodically to the faithful. In the 380s a nun named Egeria who was travelling on pilgrimage described the veneration of the True Cross at Jerusalem in a long letter known as her &quot;Itinerary&quot; (), which she sent back to her convent:

Before long, but perhaps not until after the visit of Egeria, it was possible also to venerate the crown of thorns, the pillar at which Christ was scourged, and the lance that pierced his side.

===The Perso-Byzantine Wars===
The Sassanid Emperor Khosrau II (&quot;Chosroes&quot;) removed the part of the cross held in Jerusalem as a trophy after he captured the city in 614. Thirteen years later, in 628, the Byzantine emperor Heraclius defeated Khosrau and regained the relic from Shahrbaraz. He placed the cross in Constantinople at first, before restoring it to Jerusalem on 21 March 630. Some scholars disagree with this narrative, with Constantin Zuckerman going as far as to suggest that the True Cross was actually lost by the Persians and that the wood contained in the allegedly still sealed reliquary brought to Jerusalem by Heraclius in 629 was a fake. In his analysis, the hoax was designed to serve the political purposes of both Heraclius and his former foe, recently turned ally and father-in-law, the Persian general and soon-king Shahrbaraz.

===Islamic rule and the Crusades===

When Jerusalem fell to the Muslims in 638, Heraclius retrieved the True Cross but did not attempt to retake the city.

Around 1009, the year in which Fatimid caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah ordered the destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Christians in Jerusalem hid part of the cross and it remained hidden until the city was taken by the European soldiers of the First Crusade. Arnulf Malecorne, the first Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, had the Greek Orthodox priests who were supposedly in possession of the Cross tortured in order to reveal its location. The relic that Arnulf recovered was a small fragment of wood embedded in a golden cross, and it became the most sacred relic of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, with none of the controversy that had followed their discovery of the Holy Lance in Antioch. Displayed in a jewel-encrusted housing of gold and silver, it was housed in a northern chapel at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, overseen by its canons and protected by its knights. A second chapel beside it was overseen by the Syrian Orthodox and displayed another reliquary holding their fragment of the cross. The Latin fragment of the cross was repeatedly carried into battle against the Muslims. 

Over the course of each liturgical calendar, the Latin patriarch would oversee mass at the various churches around Jerusalem corresponding to the part of Jesus&#x27;s life being celebrated. The celebrations of Holy Week closely involved the Holy Sepulchre and its fragment of the True Cross. During lauds on each Good Friday, the Latin relic was carried across the church to the chapel of Calvary on its south side, the supposed site of Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion, and then venerated by the barefoot patriarch, the sepulchre&#x27;s canons, and the assembled pilgrims until sext. Prior to the liturgy on Holy Saturday, four pilgrims selected by the patriarchpreceded by a thurifer and 2 acolytescarried the Latin relic from its chapel to the edicule of the Holy Sepulchre while the congregation waited with unlit candles. A New Fire would &quot;spontaneously&quot; light within the sepulchre. The crossbearer then would light his own candle from it, transit the entire church, and light the candle of the waiting patriarch. The candles of the canons and then the congregation were then lit from one to another, gradually filling the church with light.

After King BaldwinI of Jerusalem presented King SigurdI of Norway with a splinter of the True Cross following the Norwegian Crusade in 1110, the Cross was captured by Saladin during the Battle of Hattin in 1187. While some Christian rulers like Richard the Lionheart of England, the Byzantine emperor IsaacII, and Queen Tamar of Georgia sought to ransom it from Saladin, the cross was not returned. In 1219 the True Cross was offered to the Knights Templar by Al-Kamil in exchange for lifting the siege of Damietta. The cross was never delivered as Al-Kamil did not, in fact, have it. Subsequently the cross disappeared from historical records. The True Cross was last seen in the city of Damascus following the Battle of Hattin.

===21st-century status===
The Greek Orthodox church presents a small True Cross relic shown in the Greek Treasury within the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at the foot of Golgotha. The Syriac Orthodox Church also claims a small relic of the True Cross (held in the Monastery of Saint Mark in Jerusalem), as does the Armenian Apostolic Church (in Armenia). According to the 15th-century &quot;Book of Ṭeff Grains&quot;, the emperor DawitI received four fragments of the True Cross around the year 1400 from Coptic Christians as thanks for his protection. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church claims these relics are still held at either Egziabher Ab or Tekle Maryam, two monasteries near the former imperial cemetery on Amba Geshen.

==Dispersion of relics==
An inscription of 359 found at Tixter, in the neighbourhood of Sétif in Mauretania (in today Algeria), was said to mention, in an enumeration of relics, a fragment of the True Cross, according to an entry in &quot;Roman Miscellanies&quot;, X, 441.

Fragments of the Cross were broken up, and the pieces were widely distributed; in 348, in one of his &quot;Catecheses&quot;, Cyril of Jerusalem remarked that the &quot;whole Earth is full of the relics of the Cross of Christ&quot; and, in another, &quot;The holy wood of the Cross bears witness, seen among us to this day, and from this place now almost filling the whole world, by means of those who in faith take portions from it.&quot; Egeria&#x27;s account testifies to how highly these relics of the crucifixion were prized. John Chrysostom relates that fragments of the True Cross were kept in golden reliquaries, &quot;which men reverently wear upon their persons.&quot; Even two Latin inscriptions around 350 from today&#x27;s Algeria testify to the keeping and admiration of small particles of the cross. Around the year 455, Juvenal Patriarch of Jerusalem sent to Pope Leo I a fragment of the &quot;precious wood&quot;, according to the &quot;Letters&quot; of Pope Leo. A portion of the cross was taken to Rome in the seventh century by Pope Sergius I, who was of Byzantine origin. &quot;In the small part is power of the whole cross&quot;, says an inscription in the Felix Basilica of Nola, built by bishop Paulinus at the beginning of 5th century. The cross particle was inserted in the altar.

The Old English poem &quot;Dream of the Rood&quot; mentions the finding of the cross and the beginning of the tradition of the veneration of its relics. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; also talks of King Alfred receiving a fragment of the cross from Pope Marinus (see: Annal Alfred the Great, year 883). Although it is possible, the poem need not be referring to this specific relic or have this incident as the reason for its composition. However, there is a later source that speaks of a bequest made to the &#x27;Holy Cross&#x27; at Shaftesbury Abbey in Dorset; Shaftesbury abbey was founded by King Alfred, supported with a large portion of state funds and given to the charge of his own daughter when he was aliveit is conceivable that if Alfred really received this relic, that he may have given it to the care of the nuns at Shaftesbury.

Most of the very small relics of the True Cross in Europe came from Constantinople. The city was captured and sacked by the Fourth Crusade in 1204. The &quot;Chronica Regia Coloniensis&quot; relates that &quot;After the conquest of the city Constantinople inestimable wealth was found: incomparably precious jewels and also a part of the cross of the Lord, which Helena transferred from Jerusalem and [which] was decorated with gold and precious jewels. There it attained [the] highest admiration. It was carved up by the present bishops and was divided with other very precious relics among the knights; later, after their return to the homeland, it was donated to churches and monasteries.&quot; The French knight Robert de Clari wrote that &quot;within this chapel were found many precious relics; for therein were found two pieces of the True Cross, as thick as a man&#x27;s leg and a fathom in length.&quot;

The misplacement of which particular class relics of the Holy Cross (and others in general) belong to, either as a result of confusion or exaggeration; and the outright forgery of relics, was a recurring controversy during the Medieval Age. This happened, often in order to attract pilgrims; or even to facilitate the lucrative practice of simony.

By the end of the Middle Ages so many churches claimed to possess relics of the True Cross, that John Calvin is famously said to have remarked that there was enough wood in them to fill a ship:
Conflicting with this is the finding of Charles Rohault de Fleury, who, in his &quot;Mémoire sur les instruments de la Passion&quot; of 1870 made a study of the relics in reference to the criticisms of Calvin and Erasmus. He drew up a catalogue of all known relics of the True Cross showing that, in spite of what various authors have claimed, the fragments of the Cross brought together again would not reach one-third that of a cross which has been supposed to have been in height, with transverse branch of wide, proportions not at all abnormal. He calculated: supposing the Cross to have been of pine-wood (based on his microscopic analysis of the fragments) and giving it a weight of about seventy-five kilogrammes, we find the original volume of the cross to be . The total known volume of known relics of the True Cross, according to his catalogue, amounts to approximately (more specifically 3,942,000 cubic millimetres), leaving a volume of , almost 98%, lost, destroyed, or from which is otherwise unaccounted. Four cross particles – of ten particles with surviving documentary provenances by Byzantine emperors – from European churches, i.e. Santa Croce in Rome, Caravaca de la Cruz, Notre Dame, Paris, Pisa Cathedral and Florence Cathedral, were microscopically examined. &quot;The pieces came all together from olive.&quot; It is possible that many alleged pieces of the True Cross are forgeries, created by travelling merchants in the Middle Ages, during which period a thriving trade in manufactured relics went on.

Smyrnakis notes that the largest surviving portion, of 870,760 cubic millimetres, is preserved in the Monastery of Koutloumousiou on Mount Athos, and also mentions the preserved relics in Rome (consisting of 537,587 cubic millimetres), in Brussels (516,090 cubic millimetres), in Venice (445,582 cubic millimetres), in Ghent (436,450 cubic millimetres) and in Paris (237,731 cubic millimetres).

Santo Toribio de Liébana in Spain is also said to hold the largest of these pieces and is one of the most visited Roman Catholic pilgrimage sites. In Asia, the only place where the other part of the True Cross is located is in the Monasterio de Tarlac at San Jose, Tarlac, Philippines.

The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church also claims to have the right wing of the true cross buried in the monastery of Gishen Mariam. This piece was gifted by the Venetian Republic to the Ethiopian Empire in the medieval period and remained in the Atse Emperor&#x27;s personal possession into the 18th century, even being lost in battle, before being buried atop Amba Geshen. 

In 2016, a relic of True Cross held by Waterford Cathedral in Ireland, was radiocarbon dated to the 11th century by Oxford University. 

In February 2020, the Sevastopol district archpriest Sergiy Khalyuta said that a piece of the True Cross was bought by a donor, and was to be placed on board the Russian missile cruiser &quot;Moskva&quot;, which has a chapel on board. The ship sank in April 2022 during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. After the sinking, there was speculation that the fragment may have gone down with the ship.

==Veneration==

John Chrysostom wrote homilies on the three crosses:
The Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Anglican and some Protestant churches celebrate the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross on September 14, the anniversary of the dedication of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In later centuries, these celebrations also included commemoration of the rescue of the True Cross from the Persians in 628. In the Galician usage, beginning about the seventh century, the Feast of the Cross was celebrated on May 3. According to the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, when the Galician and Roman practices were combined, the September date, for which the Vatican adopted the official name &quot;Triumph of the Cross&quot; in 1963, was used to commemorate the rescue from the Persians and the May date was kept as the &quot;Invention of the True Cross&quot; to commemorate the finding. The September date is often referred to in the West as Holy Cross Day; the May date (see also Roodmas) was dropped from the liturgical calendar of the Catholic Church in 1960 when the Roman Breviary was reformed by Pope John XXIII. The Orthodox still commemorate both events on September 14, one of the Twelve Great Feasts of the liturgical year, and the Procession of the Venerable Wood of the Cross on 1 August, the day on which the relics of the True Cross would be carried through the streets of Constantinople to bless the city.

In addition to celebrations on fixed days, there are certain days of the variable cycle when the Cross is celebrated. The Catholic Church has a formal Adoration of the Cross during the services for Good Friday. In Eastern Orthodox churches everywhere, a replica of the cross is brought out in procession during Matins of Great and Holy Friday for the people to venerate. The Orthodox also celebrate an additional Veneration of the Cross on the third Sunday of Great Lent.

<text>Nicholas John McCabe (born 14 July 1971) is an English musician, best known as being the lead guitarist of the rock group the Verve.

==Early life==
McCabe is the son of a bus driver father and a social worker mother and has two older brothers, Alan and Paul. When asked what it was that inspired him to become a guitarist, he answered: &quot;That was me, I just got a guitar, and I could play a few things on it, and I liked messing with it, and I liked making my own things up.&quot; He attended Haydock High School, and later met Richard Ashcroft at Winstanley College. Ashcroft described McCabe&#x27;s guitar playing as sounding like &quot;a whole other universe&quot;; the two briefly played in a band whilst at college. After leaving college, McCabe began a career as a quantity surveyor. He later recalled: &quot;I hated it. I used to sit there all day scribbling in my pad thinking about guitar sounds.&quot; He gave this up to be part of the Verve along with Ashcroft, Simon Jones and Peter Salisbury.

==The Verve==

McCabe was generally an aloof member, being involved in relatively few interviews. Tensions and power struggles between McCabe and Ashcroft would later cause the band&#x27;s dissolution. The first break-up happened in 1995 when Ashcroft left after the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;A Northern Soul&quot;. Shortly thereafter Ashcroft reformed the band without McCabe, replacing him with Simon Tong. McCabe returned home to work on his own music and spend time with his daughter until Ashcroft asked him to return in 1997, for the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;. Despite the album&#x27;s success, McCabe left in 1998, and although the Verve continued touring without him, the band later split for the second time in early 1999.

In early 2007, McCabe made peace with Ashcroft, and the band reunited. A new album, &quot;Forth&quot;, was released in 2008. However, the band broke up again in 2009.

==Other projects==
Following The Verve&#x27;s split in 1999, McCabe kept a relatively low profile. In 2001, he played on &quot;Walking Home&quot; for John Martyn&#x27;s album &quot;On the Cobbles&quot;. In 2002, he played on &quot;Lost Broadcast&quot; for Faultline&#x27;s album &quot;Your Love Means Everything&quot;. In 2004, McCabe&#x27;s remix of The Music&#x27;s song &quot;The People&quot; appeared on their single &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot;. In March 2009, following the death of Martyn, McCabe discussed Martyn&#x27;s music and the experience of working with him in an interview with &quot;Mojo&quot;.

In 2009 McCabe founded a new band called The Black Ships with Jones, drummer Mig Schillace, and electric violinist Davide Rossi. The Black Ships released their first EP, &quot;Kurofune&quot;, in May 2011, and performed their debut gig at Kings College Student Union on 2 June 2011 before changing their name to Black Submarine in mid-2012.

In November 2019 McCabe began releasing solo work to Bandcamp, initially as a side project called Litter and Leaves with Black Submarine member Amelia Tucker and then under his own name. In June 2022 he released the EP &quot;Home Is Where the Heart Is&quot;, a collaboration with Verve drummer Peter Salisbury and featuring Tucker.

==Musical style==
McCabe stands still whilst playing, with one reviewer in 1993 describing him as having &quot;coaxed gorgeous, shimmering wodges of sound from his instrument while exuding all the enthusiasm of a man waiting for a bus.&quot;

McCabe has cited artists such as Joy Division, John Martyn and Eddie Hazel as inspirations. He has also expressed his fondness of synthesizers and explained his &#x27;psychedelic&#x27; sound as trying to make a guitar sound like a synthesizer by using effects pedals and valve amps.

Producer Owen Morris referred to McCabe as &quot;without a shadow of a doubt the most gifted musician I&#x27;ve ever worked with&quot;, but also claimed he was &quot;a complete and utter nightmare&quot; to work with, saying &quot;He&#x27;ll never play the same thing twice. Now you can ask Noel Gallagher to play the same guitar line a hundred times, and as long as there&#x27;s a good reason for him doing it, he&#x27;ll do it. But with Nick you&#x27;ve got no chance. But that&#x27;s what he does, y&#x27;know?&quot;

<doc id="263397" wikidata="Q300507" url="?curid=263397" title="A Northern Soul">
<text>A Northern Soul is the second studio album by English rock band the Verve, released on 3 July 1995 through Hut Records. With the tumultuous promotion for their debut studio album, &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot; (1993), combined with their friends in Oasis becoming popular, relationships between members of the Verve became strained. After connecting with Oasis producer Owen Morris, the Verve went to a rehearsal space in Wigan to write material for the next album, which they recorded at Loco Studios in Wales. The sessions gained notoriety for the stories that emerged from the time, including Ashcroft going missing for five days and him allegedly totalling a car on the studio&#x27;s lawn. In the first three weeks, they had finished 15 tracks; after this point, the situation soured as guitarist Nick McCabe grew exhausted from dealing with the other members frequently partying and taking ecstasy, in addition to vocalist Richard Ashcroft and Morris shouting and destroying objects. At one point, McCabe began to have a different working schedule from the others, starting at 10–11 a.m. while the rest of the band started at 6 p.m.

Variously described as alternative rock, Britpop, psychedelic rock, and psychedelic soul, Ashcroft said &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; revolved around one person experiencing various emotions. He wrote material for it after the end of a six-year relationship, using a portastudio at co-manager John Best&#x27;s house over several weeks. The Verve started promotion with a UK gig supporting Oasis in April 1995, followed by one in France two days later. After McCabe was injured in an altercation with a bouncer, a month&#x27;s worth of shows were cancelled. &quot;This Is Music&quot; was released as the lead single from the album in May 1995, followed by the second single, &quot;On Your Own&quot;, a month later. The Verve embarked on a UK tour in June 1995, which was followed by appearances at the Glastonbury and Phoenix Festivals. They went on a US tour, which lasted until August 1995, when they returned to the UK to play at T in the Park. At its conclusion, Ashcroft announced his departure from the band, which the press reported as if they were breaking up. &quot;History&quot; was the third and final single from the album, released in September 1995.

&quot;A Northern Soul&quot; received positive reviews from music critics, many of whom praised the album&#x27;s musical depth, while others commented on the personal nature of the lyrics. Retrospective reviews and biographies of the Verve were also focused on the music. The album peaked at number 13 on the UK Albums Chart, going on to be certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in 1998. All three of its singles peaked within the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, with &quot;History&quot; peaking the highest at number 24. &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;NME,&quot; and &quot;Select&quot; included the album on their lists of the year&#x27;s best releases; &quot;NME&quot; also included it on their list of the 500 best albums of all time, while author Colin Larkin featured it in his book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). It has appeared on best-of lists for the Britpop genre by &quot;Musikexpress&quot;, &quot;Pitchfork,&quot; and &quot;Spin&quot;.

==Background==
The Verve released their debut studio album, &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot;, in June 1993 through the Virgin imprint Hut Records. Reaching number 27 in the UK Albums Chart, it entered a music scene dominated by grunge, sitting against the emergence of British bands Blur and Suede. Shortly afterwards, frontman Richard Ashcroft said he wanted to record the follow-up as soon as possible. In 1993, the band promoted the album with a UK tour, a European tour with the Smashing Pumpkins – by which point they were writing songs for their next album – a US tour with Acetone, and ending with a UK tour with Acetone and up-and-comers Oasis. The Verve&#x27;s notoriety as troublemakers was exacerbated by connecting themselves with Oasis. In 1994, the Verve went on a Europe tour, trekked across the US as part of Lollapalooza, and played a series of European festivals, including Reading Festival. In the lead-up to Lollapalooza, the compilation &quot;No Come Down&quot; (1994) was issued as a stop-gap release. Keith Wood of the Verve&#x27;s US label, Vernon Yard Recordings, said the band initially planned to record their second album around this time, until they decided to do Lollapalooza instead.

Issues plagued the members during the stint, including drummer Peter Salisbury getting arrested and Ashcroft being taken to the hospital for not drinking enough fluids. The grind of touring the US eventually took its toll on Ashcroft and guitarist Nick McCabe, with the pair not being on friendly terms. Throughout that year, interpersonal relationships between members of the Verve grew apart, spurred on by the ballooning popularity of their friends in Oasis. That band&#x27;s debut, &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; (1994), had performed better on the charts than &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot;, which was a commercial failure. Author Trevor Baker, in his book &quot;Richard Ashcroft – The Verve, Burning Money &amp; The Human Condition&quot; (2008), wrote that following the popularity of &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;, sales predictions for indie acts shifted considerably, and the band were seen by some commentators as lucky for not being removed from the Virgin Records roster. Brian Cannon of the design company Microdot, who created art for both Oasis and the Verve, attributed the frequent support of Hut Records boss Dave Boyd as a factor.

==Writing and Morris&#x27; involvement==
Since the recording of their debut album, Ashcroft had some life-changing experiences that would fuel his songwriting. Towards the end of 1994, Ashcroft and his girlfriend Sarah Carpenter ended their six-year relationship when the latter became infatuated with one of the band&#x27;s roadies, Andy Burke, who was also one of Ashcroft&#x27;s best friends. As Ashcroft was dealing with this, Jones was also going through mental struggles. The latter found it difficult to acclimatise at home in Wigan after Lollapalooza and the US in general. McCabe was also breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend Monica; he was growing weary of others around him. Ashcroft fled to London and, subsequently, the countryside without informing anyone. Ashcroft attempted to reconcile with her in London over a period of three months. For two of those three, he was mentally and physically exhausted. When he reconvened with the rest of the band, they were performing the music that he felt conveyed the emotions he was experiencing, allowing the two aspects to go together with relative ease. Ashcroft stayed with Best, who was dating Lush frontwoman Miki Berenyi, for a period of six-to-eight weeks. Best had a portastudio in his frontroom that Berenyi used for making songs, which Ashcroft used when borrowing her acoustic guitar to write for himself.

When the band wanted a different producer for their second album, Noel Gallagher of Oasis proposed Owen Morris, who had co-produced &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;. Morris himself shared a similar perspective on the as the Verve. Ashcroft said they went with him as he was around their age and equally as intense as the rest of the band in &quot;everything we do, lifestyle, music, everything ...&quot; As the members wanted to avoid repeating mistakes that they had made on &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot;, they set about writing prior to entering a studio. The band holed up in their former rehearsal space in Wigan, which Ashcroft dubbed a &quot;black hole, a claustrophobic pit.&quot; The space was located in a dark industrial warehouse, which they felt was inspirational to the point that Ashcroft and McCabe put aside their personal issues. The members drove around during the night on occasion, seeking further inspiration. Ashcroft learned of a tale from Keith Richards where he talked about the Rolling Stones being mocked by Dean Martin, which he connected to and used as an influence: &quot;That&#x27;s what happened to us ... we just thought, &#x27;Fuck you all, we&#x27;re gonna delve into our black hole in Wigan and make the greatest music you&#x27;ve heard in your life. Morris, whose visibility as a producer increased after &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;, visited the band during one of their rehearsals, feeling enthusiastic about what he was hearing. It was a fruitful period, with them having two albums&#x27; worth of songs in time for recording, contrasting with creating the bulk of &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot; as they were recording it.

==Recording==
The initial idea for the recording sessions was to take recording gear to their rehearsal room, as they were the most productive there, and it had the right atmosphere. When they realised that it was impractical to use it for recording, they decided on Loco Studios in Wales. Philip Wilding, author of &quot;The Verve: Bitter Sweet&quot; (1998), wrote that the sessions for their second album became mythologised as a combination of &quot;lurid stories and gruesome hearsay echoing in stories of drug-fuelled jam sessions that became extensive recording sessions and bouts of reckless violence.&quot; Baker conveyed a similar situation, while singling out co-manager John Best for describing the situation as . Author Sean Egan, in his book &quot;The Verve: Star Sail&quot; (1998), said various tales have since come out about the sessions, including: Ashcroft allegedly totalling a hired car by driving it on the studio&#x27;s lawn; the band often playing a single song for hours at a time; Ashcroft disappearing for five days; and the band debating whether to destroy a tape machine, which was valued at £100,000, so that they could get a sound to end the album on. Morris, who co-produced the sessions with them, said his job was to contain the audio of the band performing and not make it sound bland. The band and Morris were assisted in the studio by engineer Mark Lee. To aid the recording sessions, the band gave the studio a club atmosphere by playing music the entire time, taking ecstasy, and working on material when they felt inspired to. By the first three weeks, they had completed 15 songs; by contrast, for &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot;, they only did one song a week in the same length of time. As the band as a unit strived for perfection, it meant that the individual members had strained relationships with one another. After this point, the situation soured as McCabe, bagged by the issues with Monica, became tired of the frequent partying that the other members were doing. He said Ashcroft and Morris were yelling and breaking objects. Jones said they did not need any encouragement from Morris, who was &quot;as mad as you like&quot;, adding that it was &quot;all ... &quot;too much&quot;.&quot;

While Jones did not explain what happened during the sessions, Boyd said it was a group of people growing up, combined with ecstasy consumption. There was one instance where the band was locked out from entering the studio because an employee was concerned about what they could do to the facilities. Boyd said Morris was also consuming ecstasy; there was one three-week period where Morris and the band ingested the drug every day. On one occasion, Best visited the studio only to find Morris, who was high on ecstasy, standing on the recording console with a glass of alcohol. He promptly threw the drink at the room&#x27;s glass wall, leaving a hole the size of a large bullet. Best compared the encounter to entering a 
turbulent celebration with a &quot;lunatic edge to it.&quot; He noticed that the members were operating on different schedules. As McCabe had a child, he wanted to start working at 10–11 a.m. and finish at 10–11 p.m. The rest of the band, meanwhile, woke up at 2 p.m., recorded at 6 p.m., and finished at 6 a.m. the following morning. McCabe said he was emotionally distraught, reaching a point where the only common trait between them was creating music, while his life at home was equally a &quot;disaster and I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable anywhere.&quot; He was forced to contribute more during the sessions than other guitarists would, owing to him having to track both the rhythm and lead guitar parts. Egan said these parts were &quot;already more complex than most bands&#x27; because of the atmospheric nature of The Verve&#x27;s music.&quot; McCabe found the partying boring and an annoying distraction.
Ashcroft came close to being a casualty of drugs akin to Roky Erickson or Arthur Lee of Love; he was still emotionally damaged from his split with Carpenter, which did not help. When Ashcroft came to this realisation, he was distraught, only to be exacerbated when he had a vision of Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd, another drug casualty. Following this, the band returned to their habit of jamming for days at a time in an attempt to make music that was as worthwhile as something by their musical heroes. When they finished working on a song, they relaxed in the studio&#x27;s lounge, listening to the likes of Miles Davis, Funkadelic, and Gram Parsons. Everyone eventually came to the conclusion that the only time work was done was on Wednesdays. Baker said the band took &quot;three days to build up to a peak and then spend the next three days coming down.&quot; Part of this stemmed from Ashcroft becoming a more confident songwriter; he was content to offer his voice on finished backing tracks, though after the split from Carpenter, he had written stylistically different material. Baker said while their debut album appealed to music obsessives, the new material appeared more direct, with Ashcroft being enthusiastic about how his lyrics were developing for their new album. The strings for &quot;History&quot;, performed by Gavyn Wright and the London Session Orchestra, were recorded at Studio 2 at Abbey Road Studios in London. Here, Ashcroft, Liam Gallagher, and 30 associates of the band contributed handclaps to the track.

Morris was exhausted from the sessions as the band, going as far as to say they did not need a producer as they would &quot;do [a] producer&#x27;s head in.&quot; According to Jones, Morris exclaimed that he would never work with the Verve again, almost quitting towards the end of the sessions. Ashcroft commended Morris for involving himself to the degree that he saw him akin to a member of the band, adding that they sought a producer that was &quot;extreme. Owen brought his personality to the record. [...] He admitted he nearly had a nervous breakdown, and I think that&#x27;s a commendable performance.&quot; He summarised the process as four challenging months that were &quot;insane. In great ways and terrible ways. In ways that only good music and bad drugs and mixed emotions can make.&quot; Outtakes from the album&#x27;s sessions included &quot;The Rolling People&quot; and &quot;Come On&quot;, both of which were tackled during recording sessions in 1997. Two weeks were spent mixing the recordings, which took place at Loco. To retain a raw sound, minimal overdubs were done to the tracks. The final mix was intentionally bottom heavy, with the bass and drums being placed higher in the mix to what Egan described as a &quot;thumping feel at odds with the sterility of the CD age. Again, this tied in with the convoluted &#x27;soul&#x27; concept that The Verve returned to repeatedly in interview.&quot; Ashcroft said listeners ignored bass and drums &quot;for too long. On our albums you have to turn it down, which is cool, like in a lot of good soul records, Sly [Stone] records, heavy bass ...&quot; McCabe typically preferred the demos they made, as he thought the songs lost their edge when they were recorded properly. He said working with Leckie on their debut, they had to concede, and while working with Morris, it allowed them to have &quot;a lot more control over the sound.&quot; The album was then mastered by Jack Adams at The Townhouse in London.

==Composition and lyrics==
===Title and music===
Discussing the album, Ashcroft said the &quot;doors have opened for me personally with my writing. We&#x27;ve been liberated. Touring, you get lost on a rock and roll adventure. You&#x27;re on the &quot;Stardust&quot; trip. You&#x27;re in the mansion in your head with the white robes on doing rock operas called &#x27;Woman&#x27;. But then you come home and it&#x27;s time to get twenty Regal and a pastie and assess who you are. That&#x27;s why the new album&#x27;s got more soul to it. It&#x27;s modern Northern blues.&quot; Egan said a possibility for the album&#x27;s title was how the Verve viewed their sound as the &quot;result of a fundamental sincerity.&quot; &quot;musicOMH&quot; Ben Hogwood suggested that the title was a confident declaration of their Wigan lineage, which he said was a noble proclamation, though &quot;ultimately a doomed one.&quot; He added that it was taken from the 1960s Northern soul movement, where it focuses its &quot;impact on the whole body and mind rather than just the feet, shaking it from the very core.&quot; Ashcroft said the album revolved around one person experiencing various emotions: &quot;pretty painted, then elated, then arrogant. All facets of that personality are a northern soul.&quot; Egan said this character was Ashcroft incognito, writing that a few critics were sceptical about how an individual soul&#x27; could have gone through such torment as to inspire such desolate ...&quot;
&quot;Gigwise&quot; writer AP Childs considered &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; an alternative rock album that surpasses the &quot;stargazer dreaminess of the previous offering with its tortured glamour of industrial-sized proportions.&quot; He said that, beside &quot;Brainstorm Interlude&quot;, there was little psychedelic music to be found on it. Nick Southall of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; dubbed it &quot;[m]odern, urban, tortured psychedelic soul&quot;, while &quot;Spin&quot; Alex Pappademas saw it as psychedelic rock and Britpop. Clarke was dismissive of the Britpop tag, adamant that the Verve had nothing to do with that genre musically or visually. Kayley Kravitz of &quot;Vanyaland&quot; reaffirmed Britpop, saying the Verve did what Blur and Lush had done before them, moving away from shoegaze and into Britpop. Best said the album had two different sides at odds with one another: &quot;You&#x27;ve got songs that are traditional Verve psychedelic work-outs and then you&#x27;ve got songs like &#x27;History&#x27; that I heard and thought, &quot;Wow! This is a very interesting new development.&quot;&quot; McCabe felt that his playing ability had also improved, owing to the two years promoting &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot;.

Jones explained that it was not literal soul music but rather soul music in the manner that they were &quot;expressing ourselves and playing from our heart. A lot of the songs on this album are first takes, just us going in and playing from a feeling.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot; writer Ian King wrote that McCabe&#x27;s guitar playing informed the sound of &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; and noted that it was an important point in their history where Ashcroft&#x27;s skill as a songwriter began to take hold of the band, highlighting &quot;On Your Own&quot; and &quot;History&quot; as prime examples. He remarked that both are stylistically different – &quot;On Your Own&quot; being a slow-tempo acoustic ballad and &quot;History&quot; serving as a symphonic track – and both feature less guitarwork. King said that McCabe&#x27;s guitar playing originally helped them stand out from their contemporaries more than Ashcroft did. &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; marked the point where Ashcroft became the leader of the Verve. In addition to their usual roles in the band, the members provided extra instrumentations to the songs: Ashcroft with percussion on &quot;This Is Music&quot;, &quot;So It Goes&quot;, &quot;History&quot;, and &quot;Life&#x27;s an Ocean&quot;, acoustic guitar on &quot;On Your Own&quot;, &quot;So It Goes&quot;, &quot;History&quot;, and &quot;Stormy Clouds&quot;, and electric piano on &quot;No Knock on My Door&quot;; Jones with percussion on &quot;A New Decade&quot;, keyboards on &quot;A Northern Soul&quot;, twelve-string acoustic guitar on &quot;History&quot;; McCabe with piano on &quot;On Your Own&quot; and &quot;Stormy Clouds&quot;, twelve-string guitar on &quot;On Your Own&quot;, acoustic guitar on &quot;So It Goes&quot; and &quot;Stormy Clouds&quot;, Hammond organ on &quot;So It Goes&quot;, and a Moog synthesizer on &quot;Stormy Clouds&quot;; and Salisbury with percussion on &quot;A New Decade&quot;, &quot;This Is Music&quot;, &quot;So It Goes&quot;, &quot;History&quot;, and &quot;Life&#x27;s an Ocean&quot;.

===Themes===

On the album&#x27;s lyrics, Ashcroft said that, as a whole, it was him &quot;asking myself: &#x27;Who the fuck am I?&#x27; Am I the guy in &#x27;This Is Music&#x27; standing tall in the world with these huge guitars around him like the king of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, or am I the guy in &#x27;A Northern Soul&#x27; who&#x27;s wasted and desperate, or am I the guy in &#x27;On Your Own&#x27;, who&#x27;s in between life and death, or am I the guy in &#x27;Life&#x27;s an Ocean&#x27; imagining the future and buying feelings from a vending machine, am I this future shock guy? But I&#x27;m all of them, you see. It’s dangerous to fracture your personality too much, but that’s what it was.&quot; Egan noted that there were allusions to a &quot;broken love affair&quot;, which prompted questions as Ashcroft&#x27;s emotional turmoil was not public knowledge until mid-1995. During an interview with journalist Dave Simpson for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Ashcroft talked about the subject matter with Jones, which nearly resulted in a heated argument between the members. Egan said the love triangle of Ashcroft–Carpenter–Burke resulted in an album with lyrics that were &quot;far more literal and which had far more emotional impact&quot; than anything Ashcroft previously wrote, a change from &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot;, where he had no desire to compose lyrics with a political tone or discuss romance. He said &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; could potentially be viewed as a concept album because of these lyrics. Describing the changing lyrical tone, Egan wrote that &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot; was centred around &quot;slogans and wordplay,&quot; which were the product of listening to other albums and watching films, compared to &quot;A Northern Soul&quot;, where the lyrics were a result of Ashcroft having first-hand experiences. Ashcroft said the first album&#x27;s lyrics were highly vague as he thought he had not gone through enough events in his life to conceive upping the quality of his lyrics, but in the two years since their debut album, he has witnessed various &quot;things, I realise that when I listen to music I want to hear people who have been there, and if they&#x27;ve not been there I&#x27;m not interested, and I&#x27;ve been there now.&quot;

Ashcroft thought that if someone is direct about what they say, then other individuals will relate to how accessible it is. Clarke said he was influenced by poems by William Blake, dating to the late 1800s and early 1900s, especially his collection &quot;Songs of Innocence and Experience&quot;. Blake&#x27;s writing led him to discover Aldous Huxley, who had admiration for Blake. One instance saw Ashcroft borrow some of the lines from Blake&#x27;s London, which he thought was poignant after the split from Carpenter. Ashcroft spent several hours walking directionless around London prior to making a demo of &quot;History&quot; with a Spanish guitar that belonged to his mother. He admitted to intentionally lifting the lines from the poem until his own lyrics came about through a stream of consciousness. &quot;NME&quot; writer Simon Williams was highly critical of this borrowing, saying, &quot;Forsooth! Fetch this good fellow a flagon of your finest ale.&quot; On &quot;A New Decade&quot;, Ashcroft acknowledges the success the band had achieved up to this point, while on &quot;This Is Music&quot;, he details his fascination with music. Clarke said &quot;On Your Own&quot; &quot;repeats the idea of an emotional void&quot;, adding that the &quot;cathartic nature of much of the album appeared to have given him new hope ...&quot; Hogwood said on &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot;, Ashcroft&#x27;s voice was lost within the big sound of the album, fighting against the guitar and bass for presence, while on &quot;A Northern Soul&quot;, this changed, where Ashcroft&#x27;s lyrics stood out considerably more. Clarke thought it was ironic that within the band&#x27;s &quot;apparent spiritual and mystical imagery, much of this album was actually rooted in quite mundane issues ...&quot;

==Songs==
===Tracks 1–5===
Baker remarked that the first 10 seconds of opener &quot;A New Decade&quot; came across as akin to the sound of &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot;, with Ashcroft&#x27;s voice fading in, &quot;woo-woohing gently somewhere far off in the distance. Then, suddenly, the guitars kick the metaphorical doors in and Richard bellow the title like he&#x27;s announcing the start of a whole new era.&quot; Baker noted that the most prominent change compared to past material is Ashcroft&#x27;s vocals being placed higher in the mix while the guitars sounded aggressive, writing that it remained space rock, &quot;but it&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; rather than &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;.&quot; King said the lyrics appeared to be positive, at least until the listener reaches a certain . He points out an emergency siren-like sound that is heard throughout the song, signalling that the band come across as &quot;angry and wounded.&quot; With it and the following track, King wrote that Ashcroft discusses having anxiety with regards to an uncertain direction, the future generation, fear of isolation, class systems, and apathy, as the other members strike &quot;out more concisely and determined than ever.&quot;

Baker thought that &quot;This Is Music&quot; had a &quot;belligerent spirit [that] was immediately very apparent. Instead of singing vague platitudes about the sky and the sun, as he had in the past, Richard was suddenly addressing the real world.&quot; It was Ashcroft&#x27;s first political song, originating after he met an Eton alumni. Ashcroft was bewildered by the number of opportunities open to him simply because he attended private school. He thought it was akin to someone starting the journey of life ninety metres ahead of everyone else. Ashcroft said the song&#x27;s narrator was someone who had to fight to get what they wanted in any given situation. He added that he does not despise upper-class individuals, &quot;but they do take the piss.&quot; Baker said alongside discussing class, the track talks about Ashcroft being single since the end of his last relationship, adding that his self-doubt was noticeable in the album&#x27;s lyrics, and &quot;yet by the time they were recorded, a drug-fuelled bravado has entered the mix.&quot; He attributed the vocals being discernible to the influence of Oasis, sounding fully &quot;confident, bordering on arrogant,&quot; as Ashcroft steps into the band leader role. When Ashcroft heard the song for the first time, he said it lasted for 35 minutes and was similar to the sound of Funkadelic and Jimi Hendrix. McCabe&#x27;s guitar sound is the result of playing a cast aluminium guitar that dates to the early 1980s that featured three strings and was out of tune, which Baker said gave the guitar riff a &quot;harsh, metallic sound which fitted perfectly with the brutal music.&quot;

&quot;On Your Own&quot; marks the band&#x27;s first ballad track, which Clarke wrote &quot;left a disturbingly uneasy feeling about the ultimate solitude of life.&quot; Baker said it was a rarity in their music at this period, though it signalled the direction their later music went in, while Clarke said it was closer to their older songs. It marked the first time Ashcroft purposely sat down with a guitar, pen, and paper like typical songwriters. This was in contrast to his prior method of standing in front of the rest of the band as they jammed. He wrote it with little input from the rest of his bandmates; Baker described his voice as &quot;uncharacteristically shaky,&quot; most prominently when he uses a falsetto during the chorus section, where he earns a comparison to soul singers, in particular Al Green. The song sees Ashcroft lamenting his love life and the eventual prospect of dying alone. Baker noted that there was not much space for McCabe&#x27;s typical pedal-enhanced guitar experimentation in the song, with the remainder of the band serving only as a background to Ashcroft&#x27;s voice. He said the vocals were &quot;suddenly demanding all the space that Nick used to occupy and the most distinctive &#x27;effect&#x27; is the tinkling piano&quot;, which appears in the song&#x27;s conclusion. &quot;So It Goes&quot; harkens back to the sound of &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot;. In the song, Hogwood said Ashcroft divulges self-doubt amongst the frequent guitar theatrics, with him trying to place distance between the rest of the Verve and himself. Baker said the song was not up to par, though he attributed this to the tracks that were placed on either side of it.

Danny Eccleston of &quot;Q&quot; thought that &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; evoked the sound of Funkadelic. Baker thought it contained the most peculiar guitar parts McCabe had created up to that point, and that with Jones&#x27; contribution, the song came across as &quot;utterly rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll without having any recognisably rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll riffs, structure or melody.&quot; He proposed that it could be the work of the Chemical Brothers, albeit &quot;slowed down to a mighty crawl. By the end, as the guitar morphs into seagull noises, you can almost hear the euphoria of the initially recording sessions changing into a disturbing psychosis, but it still carries an incredible charge.&quot; The song was influenced by Ashcroft learning about Gallagher disappearing when Oasis were on tour in the US the previous year, which Egan said explained the allusions to a Northern soul trying to return home. He added that Gallagher was not the sole inspiration for the track, saying that it also referred to a lot of working class Englishmen, in particular those in Northern England. Ashcroft said the song&#x27;s narrator was considerably more vulnerable than Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam, yet by its conclusion, &quot;he looks around and says, &#x27;I&#x27;m too busy staying alive. Too busy living.&#x27; There&#x27;s got to be a blue horizon.&quot;

===Tracks 6–12===
Baker thought that &quot;Brainstorm Interlude&quot; was the Verve &quot;boiling over and freaking out. There are great moments but they’re bobbing in a sea of frantic noodling. It sounds like they were jamming to try and find a song, one didn’t appear but the resulting chaos was too good to ignore.&quot; &quot;Drive You Home&quot; is a country ballad in the vein of &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot; closing track, &quot;See You in the Next One (Have a Good Time)&quot;, which Jonathan Cohen of &quot;Cleveland Scene&quot; found to be reminiscent of the work of Chris Isaak. Baker saw it as a slow-tempo track that he felt lasted longer than it needed to, &quot;perhaps suggesting to some that they might be running out of ideas.&quot;

Baker thought that &quot;History&quot; did not fit on the album, suggesting that it would have been more beneficial on the band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; (1997). Baker said it was an important track in their career, marking the first occasion where strings served as one of the defining characteristics of their recordings. The strings were arranged by Wil Malone, known at the time for contributing to &quot;Unfinished Sympathy&quot; (1991) by Massive Attack. Egan saw the track as the &quot;most profound song the band had recorded to date, it was a story of loss and loneliness on an epic scale; painfully honest lyric set to a sublime melody and backed by swooning strings.&quot; Ashcroft said when he entered the studio, he had part of a melody that would eventually evolve into &quot;History&quot;. When they attempted to record it at 3 a.m., the &quot;whole six and a half minutes came out [of me] as one big flood,&quot; adding that he did not need to change any of it. By 6 a.m., he noticed a gardener outside the building shaking a matchbox and had him perform on it. Clarke said it was lyrically about the demise of his long-term relationship, proposing that it was &quot;perhaps the most lyrically direct Richard had ever been.&quot; Ashcroft explained that it was composed by a person who &quot;sat down and thought about things. Who&#x27;s gone through the classic stage of a few weeks gettin&#x27; pissed up and goin&#x27; down to those pits, listening to Big Star at six in the morning. I think [...] I hadn&#x27;t given up on love.&quot;

On &quot;No Knock on My Door&quot;, Ashcroft imitates the vocal style of Liam Gallagher; Baker said the comparison was so strong that the listener could picture Ashcroft matching Gallagher&#x27;s typical stance of being &quot;slightly too far from the mic, leaning over it with his hands behind his back, shouting to make himself heard. The machismo that John Best talked about is in full-effect but you can hear him expending his last drop of strength.&quot; Williams, meanwhile, thought that Ashcroft was doing a satisfactory &quot;impression of Shaun Ryder in a launderette as raw riffs lurch and destroy around him.&quot;

Baker noted that for the remainder of the album, the energy of the songs drops. &quot;Life&#x27;s an Ocean&quot; sees a man with a soul living in a soulless society; as Egan wrote, the chacarter&#x27;s humanity is taken from him via constant commercialism. One of its verses was influenced by the band touring across the US. Ashcroft said that following six weeks in the country, he was unable to look at any advertisements as he could not work out who they were selling to, remarking that it was alarming. He added that the song served as a Stanley Kubrick-esque vision into the future with a man who is &quot;at the end of this emotional tether.&quot; King said that when making this song, Ashcroft was exhausted to the point where he had dreams of being tormented by needing to purchase emotions from vending machines. Cohen said it starts with a &quot;funky, Luscious Jackson-esque rhythm&quot; that is followed by McCabe&#x27;s wah-wah-effected guitar parts partway into the song.

Baker felt that &quot;Stormy Clouds&quot; continues the same theme as &quot;Life&#x27;s an Ocean&quot;, though conveying it in a better way: &quot;drifting in a dreamlike fashion before the rhythm section subtly accelerates, pulling the song forward like a tractor dragging a sports car off a muddy field.&quot; King wrote that the album nears its end on a moment of fatigued realisation, seeing the new horizons&#x27; behind the &#x27;Stormy Clouds&#x27; and its winding down instrumental reprise, where McCabe unfurls a soul-searching&quot; guitar solo for six minutes, reminiscent of &quot;May This Be Love&quot; (1967) by Hendrix. For the album&#x27;s closer, &quot;(Reprise)&quot;, Wilding was surprised by McCabe&#x27;s guitar playing as it took over the rest of the music, altering the &quot;language of its discourse upside down ...&quot; Baker said the track consisted of multiple minutes where they were jamming, which he thought was proof that the tired Verve appear to &quot;have absolutely no idea how to finish the fantastic work they’d started.&quot;

==Artwork==
Cannon handled the sleeve concept, design, and art direction of the album, while Michael Spencer Jones did the photography. In addition to this, two additional photographs were taken by Scarlet Page and Mary Scanlon, who took images dubbed &quot;The Verve on the bus&quot; and &quot;The Verve in the café&quot;, respectively. Baker thought the front cover image was indicative of the Verve&#x27;s new direction, with the four heads placed in front of a black background serving as a reference to the cover for &quot;With the Beatles&quot; (1963) by the Beatles. A small door can be seen in the corner, which Baker said &quot;perhaps represent[ed] the door into their minds.&quot; Cannon said he was a huge fan of the Beatles, despite others thinking it was a homage to the video for &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; (1975) by Queen, such as Egan. They took the image inside of a warehouse, located near the Tower Bridge in London, and projected the photograph of the band, blown up to sixteen metres in height, on a wall. They had Salisbury come in through the doorway.

Cannon explained that they had the members wrapped up in black velvet, leaving only their heads visible. Egan said they wanted to depict the vastness and &quot;three-dimensional qualities&quot; that Cannon could hear in the music. The image of the members was shot on their previous US tour, which Clarke said showed &quot;how ravaged they had become, with all of them looking exhausted and mad-eyed.&quot; Journalist Mark Beaumont, in a review for &quot;NME&quot;, wrote that the shot of a person walking through a door with the image of the band on top &quot;emphasised the hugeness of the more traditional rock music they were making within.&quot; Wilding said the back cover of the album sees Jones&#x27; face being mirrored in the &quot;chrome facade of the Feelings Machine,&quot; a reference to the vending machine lyric found in &quot;Life&#x27;s an Ocean&quot;. Jones is in the process of putting 50 cents into the machine; red levers can be seen below various black-and-white images of faces giving a range of emotions from anger to sorrow. Wilding thought this recalled the artwork of the Who during their concept album phase. The machine was repurposed for the music video for the Verve&#x27;s &quot;The Drugs Don&#x27;t Work&quot; (1997).

==Release==

When recording concluded, McCabe stayed at his mother&#x27;s house in Wigan while suffering from depression. His mother inquired about his state of mind, and when she would leave the house, he threw and broke items around the place. At the same time, Ashcroft was dealing with the aftereffects of drugs and suffering from psychosis. Spencer Jones said during this period, Ashcroft had a fear of phones, as no one could get in contact with him. Best was concerned for the members as he saw that there was a &quot;problem and I could see that they weren&#x27;t talking about it&quot;, while other co-manager Jane Savage said Ashcroft seemed &quot;more insular&quot;, being singled out from the rest of the band because of the music press. In the period following &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot;, 1990s culture shifted with the emergence of new lad and &quot;Loaded&quot; magazine, as well as the continual evolution of football culture. In addition, Britpop became a mainstream movement; Ashcroft said he abstained from watching or listening to music on the TV and radio.

The Verve played their first show in eight months in Southend-on-Sea on 17 April 1995, supporting Oasis, followed by another show with them in Paris, France, two days later. For the former gig, hype was building around the Verve as critics forecasted that they could become hugely popular. This was intended to be the launch pad for a UK tour, but was cancelled due to McCabe getting into an accident. McCabe was in an altercation with a bouncer at Paris&#x27; Bataclan, who would not let him into the backstage area as he did not have a security pass. The bouncer manhandled McCabe, pushed him against a foot, hit him in the face, and kicked him down some stairs. The incident resulted in a broken finger, with it needing to be in a plaster for six weeks; it left him unable to play his guitar. The band had to cancel a month&#x27;s worth of shows because of this, including four headlining shows and a support slot for Oasis in Sheffield. By this point, comparisons were being increasingly made to Oasis by publications, which frustrated Ashcroft.

In June 1995, the Verve restarted their UK tour in Manchester, with support from Pusherman; it included a headlining spot at the Heineken Music Festival. Over the next few months, friendships deteriorated further, partially due to McCabe being unhappy. Despite having successful shows, he tried to find faults in every one; when they appeared at the Glastonbury Festival, his amp blew up. Ashcroft played maracas to compensate before it was in working order. &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; was released on 3 July 1995 through Hut Records and in the US through Vernon Yard Recordings. After a one-off show in Newcastle, the Verve supported Oasis in Scotland and then performed at the Phoenix Festival. Following this, they embarked on a US tour, dubbed Conquering America, through early August 1995. Here, they were represented by Ted Gardner of Larrikin Management. In the press, Ashcroft remained positive about the stint, despite the issues during the previous one. The trek was supported by Hum and included a performance at the Cincinnati Riverfest. McCabe was not happy with how the band was doing in the US, wishing that their label was making more effort to help them when compared to the UK, where they were gaining traction.

The situation between the members came to a head when they performed at T in the Park in August 1995, where Ashcroft reportedly seemed ill, blundering across the stage, hitting Salisbury, and throwing parts of his drum kit around. Best said that when they got into the tour bus, Ashcroft remarked that it would be the last show they played, announcing his departure from the band. Aside from the mental strain, Ashcroft was also having physical issues, such as a glandular virus, admitting that &quot;maybe I wasn&#x27;t in a fit state of mind to be making massive decisions, but that&#x27;s the way it was and everyone agreed.&quot; Best recounted that there was silence upon hearing this; Jones said that everyone involved was unhappy with the music, though he considered the situation to be an argument rather than a breakup, and only grew into a split due to how it was reported, such as by &quot;The Hard Report&quot;. McCabe admitted in 1997 that it was because of him &quot;being a miserable bastard, basically.&quot;

Best proposed that McCabe was not satisfied with the music they had been making, as he was discovering techno and experimenting with samplers and synthesizers. In a statement issued by PR company Savage and Best, Ashcroft was unhappy with the lack of glowing reception from their recent touring. The recording sessions for &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; reportedly also contributed to Ashcroft&#x27;s decision. Best said the rest of the band were disillusioned about the circumstances; in retrospect, he said he was oblivious about it, despite the members living in different towns from one another. Best also mentioned that they almost split in the midst of the album&#x27;s sessions, during a turbulent period when Ashcroft walked out of the recording studio. Three months worth of shows were cancelled, including more gigs supporting Oasis and headlining treks across Japan and mainland Europe. Egan said that as the Verve were no longer active, seemingly all the music reviewers and the public confessed their love of the band. This sentiment was further heightened when Oasis&#x27; second album, &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; (1995), came out, featuring the song &quot;Cast No Shadow&quot;, which had a dedication to Ashcroft in the booklet.

&quot;A Northern Soul&quot; was re-pressed on vinyl in 2016, 2019, and 2023. In 2016, an expanded version of the album was issued, including B-sides, EP tracks, outtakes, and BBC Radio 1 session material. &quot;This Is Music&quot;, &quot;On Your Own&quot;, and &quot;History&quot; were included on the band&#x27;s second compilation album, &quot;This Is Music: The Singles 92–98&quot; (2004), while music videos for both were featured on the video album of the same name.

===Singles===
&quot;This Is Music&quot; was released as a single on 1 May 1995, with &quot;Let the Damage Begin&quot; and &quot;You and Me&quot; as its B-sides. Cannon interpreted the song as a preacher ranting, and as such, for the artwork, Ashcroft is seen wearing a sandwich board with the lyrics printed on it. The music video was directed by Nico Beyer.

&quot;On Your Own&quot; was released as a single on 12 June 1995, with &quot;I See the Door&quot;, &quot;Little Gem&quot;, and &quot;Dance on Your Bones&quot; as its B-sides. &quot;On Your Own&quot; was issued to modern rock radio stations in the US in early June 1995. The artwork features a man named B, a friend of the band, riding on an abandoned merry-go-round. Ilic said the video for &quot;On Your Own&quot; contains a &quot;host of freakish extras, cavorting through an artificial scene of beautifully photographed lush fog.&quot; It was directed by Jake Scott; the assistant director was Spencer Leigh, whom the band knew when he was an actor in the 1980s. Scott centred the video around the film &quot;Amarcord&quot; (1973), an idea that he wanted to do for some years but did not have the right song until he heard &quot;On Your Own&quot;. It was filmed in the Hollywood Centre and featured a Napoleon doppelganger and a transgender person alongside animals, namely a dog, a horse, and a peacock.

&quot;History&quot; was released as the third single from the album on 18 September 1995. Two versions were released on CD with different B-sides: one with &quot;Grey Skies&quot; and &quot;Life&#x27;s Not a Rehearsal&quot;, while the other had &quot;Back on My Feet&quot;, an acoustic rendition of &quot;On Your Own&quot;, a remix of &quot;Monkey Magic&quot;, and an edit of &quot;History&quot;. Ashcroft directed the music video for &quot;History&quot;. It dawned on Ashcroft, who got emotional when he heard the song on the radio, that a tour behind the single would have significantly helped their career. Jones was similarly upset about not being able to get the rewards from it.

==Contemporary reviews==

&quot;A Northern Soul&quot; was met with critical acclaim in both the UK and the US; Egan said some reviewers acknowledged the album&#x27;s musical depth, while Beaumont said others focused on the highly personal nature of the lyrics.
A few critics said it evoked the sound of Oasis. The staff at &quot;Music Week&quot; made it album of the week, writing: &quot;Having resurfaced in the shadow of Oasis, The Verve sound like the former&#x27;s older brothers with their strident yet studied rock songs. Don&#x27;t overlook it.&quot; Laura Lee Davies of &quot;Time Out&quot; called the album a &quot;limbered, slack-mouthed, musical masterpiece which brings together the wiped-out, guitar-gorged promise of the Wigan outfit&#x27;s first album and a post-Happy Mondays/Stone Roses snarl and contemporary spirit which Oasis captured to such staggering commercial effect last year.&quot; She saw it difficult for Oasis to come &quot;close to such stream-of-genius rock on their follow-up album.&quot; Around one-third of Andrew Perry&#x27;s review in &quot;Select&quot; consisted of comparisons between Oasis and the Verve. He said the Verve were musically on &quot;another planet altogether. Like early U2, Bunnymen or Waterboys, they&#x27;re after a Big Music that knows no horizons. It often seems like theatre, with Ashcroft as the leading player, howling off-mike, pulling wacko faces and flapping his arms like a loony, but that&#x27;s just down to the sheer dynamic aspirations of the band behind him.&quot;
A handful focused on the lyrics and the album&#x27;s concept. Eccleston pointed out the changing aspect of Ashcroft&#x27;s lyrical themes, as the &quot;former away-with-the-faeries act&quot; was &quot;brought down to earth by the thematic one-two of death and desertion.&quot; Cohen said the album &quot;runs the gamut of life experience and should further elevate the Verve to superstar status in the United States.&quot; Perry praised the concept, saying that it &quot;weaves a series of narratives and dialogues that, in the process, lure you into the thrall of their drama.&quot; Davies found fault with the album&#x27;s thematic framing, reassuring listeners not to &quot;let the distant echo of the &#x27;concept&#x27; album alarm you [...] as it was an old-fashioned modern classic.&quot; Williams mocked the album&#x27;s concept, saying that the band&#x27;s &quot;dogged pursuit of utter, preposterous, po-faced perfection has always impressed the most. It&#x27;s the urgency, the drive, the gaping mouths, the Droopy-Dawg-stoners-storming-the-barricades-of-the-banal script.&quot;
Many reviewers praised the music. Eccleston described the album as &quot;[r]aging whirlpool rock from Wigan&#x27;s aspiring starsailors, with a dense, warm sound superseding the shiny surfaces of their John Leckie-produced and FX-swamped début&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reviewer Caroline Sullivan described this as a &quot;major refurbishment&quot; of the band&#x27;s sound and reassured listeners that this was &quot;not the bad news it sounds. &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; was stitched together with considerable delicacy, making it as much use of little oases of quiet as it does of the empire-building guitar of Nick McCabe.&quot; The staff of &quot;The Post and Courier&quot; suggest that &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; is what &quot;Second Coming&quot; (1994) by the Stone Roses was meant to sound like: &quot;high-grade British rock of the post-Manchester Scene variety. True to its name, the group indeed shows a lot of verve and, unlike the Stone Roses, they deliver the goods with precious little pomp but plenty of circumstance, musically speaking.&quot; &quot;SF Weekly&quot; Jeff Stark acknowledged that it can be difficult for bands to &quot;live up to a hype factory that equates your work to the second coming, names you heir to The Stone Roses&#x27; already waning legacy and champions you as the only contemporary chaps that band du jour will plug in interviews. But when the first loop of Richard Ashcroft&#x27;s croon wraps on &#x27;This Is Music&#x27;, there&#x27;s every indication that this will be just as dynamic and psychedelic as any previous work.&quot;

Other critics were mixed about the music. &quot;The Times&quot; David Sinclair said that several of the tracks appear to begin by &quot;sliding in halfway through a studio jam, and most of the tracks drift well past the five-minute mark without ending up any significant disturbance from where they started.&quot; Williams said, &quot;It&#x27;s the fact that nine of these 12 tracks cruise past the five minute mark with splendid non-chalance. It&#x27;s the fact that The Verve have always been ragingly, rockingly, rompingly &quot;ridiculous&quot;.&quot; &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; writer Bob Gulla said it was an &quot;undisciplined mess much of the time, but a beautiful one, with buckets of hippy freakout spirit and musical adventure.&quot; Peter Galvin of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; went more critical, writing that the guitar &quot;riffs huff and puff in search of a hook, the lyrics repeat the same banal motifs over and over. Lacking a substantial artistic vision, the Verve creates a musical sound and fury that signifies nothing.&quot; Andy Gill at &quot;The Independent&quot; lambasted the album, saying it was the audio &quot;equivalent of crushed velvet flares sagging over scuffed &quot;, adding that hearing the album was &quot;undoubtedly the longest hour of my life so far.&quot; He said the band incorporated the &quot;worst aspects of both the progressive guitar rock that is their clearest historical precedent, and the baggy scene that was current at their inception: sluggish and preposterously self-indulgent&quot;.

==Retrospective reviews==
Retrospective reviews commented on the music of &quot;A Northern Soul&quot;. Journalist Rob Sheffield in &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; said it &quot;kicked home with the gorgeous breakup ballad &#x27;On Your Own&#x27; and the epic &#x27;History,&#x27; [...] It was their breakthrough, and the Verve celebrated by splitting up almost immediately.&quot; Radhika Takru of &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; was unable to deny the maturity the album had, sporting a wider range of emotions compared to the Verve&#x27;s debut. She noted their expertise and authority of the music; she said &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; was &quot;not as personal, and far more guarded and reflective than its predecessor which sits young, loud and reckless.&quot; Hogwood saw it as &quot;far from comfortable music, made at the peak of the band’s overindulgence and prodigious drug taking.&quot; &quot;The Line of Best Fit&quot; Ed Nash said Ashcroft was setting himself up as a notable songwriter, however, Nash took issue with Ashcroft&#x27;s ballads, as they gave minimal space for McCabe&#x27;s cavernous guitar sounds, &quot;Something had to give and it was the guitarist.&quot; &quot;Record Collector&quot; writer Tim Peacock said the album was a traditional, focused rock album that got bogged &quot;down by Ashcroft’s plaintive existential angst.&quot; Childs said the album was a &quot;testament to giving up and restarting just to discover you then want to give up again. [...] The album’s content could be a paean reflecting the band’s doubt [...] the cold chorus of perhaps dark days ahead.&quot; Beaumont, in a review for &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, commented that despite its troubled production, the album was remarkably cohesive and, aside from the infrequent extended psychedelic passage, &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; was a turbulent progression &quot;from the band least likely to stay together long enough to own the 90s.&quot; For &quot;Rolling Stone Germany&quot;, journalist Sassan Niasseri said that with the album, the band displayed their &quot;rather strenuous Led Zeppelin homage, tank driver rock.&quot;
Biographers were impressed by the quality of the music on &quot;A Northern Soul&quot;, despite its troubled production. Baker thought it was not as cohesive as its predecessor, though its &quot;best moments would be among the best moments of 1995. They’d flown far away from their roots in obscure space rock and now they had songs that they could proudly put alongside the classic tunes of their youth.&quot; He felt that it had a &quot;very uneven feel&quot; steaming from the mixing of emotional ballads such as &quot;On Your Own&quot; and the &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot;-esque &quot;So It Goes&quot;. &quot;It’s not an album that flows smoothly.&quot; Ilic said the album was &quot;flowing with warm, dense and powerful overtones. McCabe&#x27;s flamboyant electrics were stamped all over it, but sounded especially blissful on &#x27;Brainstorm Interlude&#x27; and &#x27;Drive You Home&#x27;. It marked a distinct change from the freeform sculpture of their first album, and lyrically the fantasy-based songs had also veered towards the richer realms of Ashcroft&#x27;s personal experiences.&quot; Clarke noted that it was &quot;full of their trademark swirling guitars, huge rock themes and meandering, sprawling songs&quot;, and to him, it was substantially superior to the band&#x27;s older work, being &quot;richer in lyrical thought and musical texture, and easily their most accomplished project to date.&quot; He added that with the addition of sweeping string sections and &quot;ethereal guitar work, it was also a much classier record&quot;, going on to highlight Ashcroft&#x27;s direction in both his vocal parts and lyrics. Wilding wrote that the album was more plaintive in its approach when compared to their debut album, finding it &quot;nothing short of heroic. Twelve heady, soulful tracks that wouldn&#x27;t have looked amiss on some Led Zeppelin compilation.&quot; Wilding added that if you match that with Ashcroft putting the &quot;lyrical spotlight on himself and you had an album that, due to the fact that the band imploded before they could show the world just his lustrous their record might be, would fall through the net.&quot;

==Commercial performance and accolades==
&quot;A Northern Soul&quot; peaked at number 13 in the UK Albums Chart, selling more in its first month of release than &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot; had done in the two years since its release. Despite this, it fell under the band&#x27;s expectations. Its 2016 reissue re-entered the chart at number 80. The album was certified silver and gold in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in 1997 and 1998, respectively. &quot;This Is Music&quot; peaked at number 35 in the UK. &quot;On Your Own&quot; peaked at number 28 in the UK. &quot;History&quot; peaked at number 24 in the UK.

&quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;NME&quot;, and &quot;Select&quot; all included the album on their 1995 best of the year lists. Noel Gallagher and Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin praised &quot;A Northern Soul&quot;, with the former calling it the third-best album of the year. It was ranked by author Colin Larkin at number 289 in the &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000) and by &quot;NME&quot; at number 390 on their 2013 list of the 500 best albums of all time. &quot;PopMatters&quot; ranked the 2016 expanded edition of the album, with a similar reissue of &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot;, at number 10 on their list of the best 25 re-releases from the year, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included the two sets on their unranked list. Pappademas considered &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; one of 10 essential Britpop albums, while &quot;Musikexpress&quot; and &quot;Pitchfork&quot; included the album in the top 30 of their best Britpop album lists.

==Legacy==
Baker said for the majority of listeners, the album was remembered for a single track, &quot;History&quot;, which was the &quot;moment The Verve took a giant step towards popular acclaim but it was also symbolic – in more ways than one – of a band that were falling apart. Richard was starting to discover himself as a songwriter and the rest of the band could have been forgiven for thinking they were now almost surplus to requirements as he came up with the initial germ of the idea.&quot; Baker found it astonishing how the album was disregarded by music press outlets and BBC Radio One, yet listeners that did not understand the &quot;power and fury of ‘This Is Music’ or ‘A New Decade’ couldn’t help but respond to ‘History’. Unfortunately, though, most mainstream music fans never got to hear it or even read about it.&quot; Ashcroft also pointed out the lack of radio support and bemoaning promotion from magazines. While McCabe did not get along with Morris, unlike the rest of the band, he praised the final, finished work. Out of everyone they worked with previously, he said Morris was the closest to closing the gap between the band&#x27;s live and studio sounds.

The Verve returned to the sound of &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; on &quot;Neon Wilderness&quot; from &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;, which acted as a counterpart to &quot;Brainstorm Interlude&quot;. Luke Haines of labelmates the Auteurs said the success of &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; prompted higher-ups at Virgin to push him to release a commercial-sounding album with hit singles on it, resulting in &quot;How I Learned to Love the Bootboys&quot; (1999). Members of the Hiss expressed admiration for &quot;A Northern Soul&quot;; because of Morris&#x27; role on that album, they enlisted him for their album &quot;Panic Movement&quot; (2003).

<doc id="263398" wikidata="Q7257251" url="?curid=263398" title="Pub song">
<text>In English popular culture, the &quot;traditional&quot; pub songs typified by the Cockney &quot;knees up&quot; mostly come from the classics of the music hall, along with numbers from film, the stage and other forms of popular music.

The tradition is continued in the UK by acts such as Chas &amp; Dave and a Tribute to Chas and Dave called Gertcha, many of whose works are in a &#x27;pub song&#x27; format.

Typical songs include:
*&quot;Any Old Iron&quot;
*&quot;Daddy Wouldn&#x27;t Buy Me a Bow Wow&quot;
*&quot;Knees Up Mother Brown&quot;
*&quot;My Old Man&#x27;s a Dustman&quot;
*&quot;Nellie Dean&quot;
*&quot;Underneath the Arches&quot;
*&quot;Where Did You Get That Hat?&quot;

The term is also commonly used throughout The Commonwealth to refer to well-known songs that may sung communally, often in a pub setting, and often with a Celtic flare. A famous Canadian example is Home For A Rest.

<text>Clopyralid (3,6-dichloro-2-pyridinecarboxylic acid) is a selective herbicide used for control of broadleaf weeds, especially thistles and clovers. Clopyralid is in the picolinic acid family of herbicides, which also includes aminopyralid, picloram, triclopyr, and several less common herbicides. For control of creeping thistle, &quot;Cirsium arvense&quot;, a noxious, perennial weed, clopyralid is one of the few effective herbicides available. It is particularly damaging to peas, tomatoes, and sunflowers, and can render potatoes, lettuce, and spinach inedible. It does not affect grasses (family Poaceae).

Clopyralid is known for its ability to persist in dead plants and compost, and has accumulated to phytotoxic levels in finished compost in a few highly publicized cases. This first came to light in Washington, when during 2000 and 2001, residues of clopyralid were detected in commercial compost, and compost made at a municipal site damaged tomatoes and other garden plants planted in it. Word quickly spread to other local and state governments, and in 2002, DowAgro, the manufacturer of clopyralid, voluntarily deregistered it for use on domestic lawns in the US and it is banned in several US states, but it is found in consumer products in Europe such as Scotts Verdone Extra and Vitax Lawn Clear 2.

Clopyralid is licensed for lawn use in France and under these names:
Bayer Jardin: Désherbant jeune gazon and Scanner Sélectif gazon
Vilmorin: désherbant Gazon LONPAR.
Brand names of clopyralid in the US market include Stinger, Transline, Reclaim, Curtail, Confront, Clopyr AG, Lontrel, Millennium Ultra, Millenium Ultra Plus and Redeem.

<text>Ernesto Teodoro Moneta (September 20, 1833 – February 10, 1918) was an Italian journalist, nationalist, revolutionary soldier and later a pacifist and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate. He adopted the motto &quot;In varietate unitas!&quot; which later inspired the motto of the European Union.

At age 15, Moneta participated in the Five Days of Milan (1848 uprising against Austrian rule). He later attended the military academy in Ivrea. In 1859 he joined Garibaldi&#x27;s Expedition of the Thousand, and also fought in the ranks of the Italian army against the Austrians in 1866. 

Subsequently, he became an international peace activist. 

Between 1867 and 1896 he was editor of the Milan democratic paper &quot;Il Secolo&quot;, published by Edoardo Sonzogno. 

In 1890 he founded the Lombard Association for Peace and Arbitration (Unione Lombarda per la Pace e l&#x27;Arbitrato), which called for disarmament and envisaged the creation of a League of Nations and Permanent Court of Arbitration. He won (with Louis Renault) the Nobel Peace Prize in 1907.

<text>The Rarámuri or Tarahumara are a group of Indigenous people of the Americas living in the state of Chihuahua in Mexico. They are renowned for their form of prayer that involves running for extended periods of time.

Originally inhabitants of much of Chihuahua, the Rarámuri retreated to the high sierras and canyons such as the Copper Canyon in the Sierra Madre Occidental on the arrival of Spanish colonizers in the 16th century. The area of the Sierra Madre Occidental which they now inhabit is often called the Sierra Tarahumara because of their presence.

Estimates put the Rarámuri population in 2006 at between 50,000 and 70,000 people. Most still practise a traditional lifestyle, including inhabiting natural shelters (caves or cliff overhangs). Staple crops are maize and beans; however, many of the Rarámuri still practise transhumance, raising cattle, sheep, and goats. Almost all Rarámuri migrate from one place to another during the course of a year.

The Rarámuri language belongs to the Uto-Aztecan family. Although it is in decline under pressure from Spanish, it is still widely spoken. In the Rarámuri language, the endonymic term &quot;rarámuri&quot; refers specifically to the men; women are referred to as &quot;mukí&quot; (individually), and as &quot;omugí&quot; or &quot;igómale&quot; (collectively).

==History==
The Rarámuri are believed to be descended from a people of the Mogollon culture. The Rarámuri repulsed and were never conquered by the Spanish conquistadors or fully converted by the Jesuit missionaries. When the Spanish arrived in the 1500s, they called these native people the &quot;Tarahumara&quot;. By the early 17th century, the Spanish had established mines in Tarahumara territory and made some slave raids to obtain workers for the mines. Jesuit Juan Fonte established a mission, San Pablo Balleza, at the southern end of Tarahumara territory, expanding from missionary work with the Tepehuan to the south. The Tepehuan&#x27;s violent resistance to Spanish incursion in the Tepehuan revolt of 1616 killed Fonte and seven other Jesuit missionaries, closing the mission for over a decade.

The discovery of the mines of Parral, Chihuahua, in 1631 increased Spanish presence in Tarahumara lands, bringing more slave raids and Jesuit missionaries. Missions were established at Las Bocas, Huejotitán, San Felipe and Satevó. In 1648, the Tarahumara waged war against the Spanish. They gathered at Fariagic and then destroyed the mission of San Francisco de Borja. Two of the leaders of this attack were captured by the Spanish and executed. Shortly afterward, the Spanish established Villa de Aguilar in the heart of the upper Tarahumara country.

From then on, the Tarahumara split into two groups. Those in the lower missions continued to move into the general Catholic population and largely lost their tribal identity. Those in the upper areas went to war under the leadership of Tepóraca and others, driving the Jesuits and Spanish settlers from the area. The Jesuits returned in the 1670s and ultimately baptized thousands of Tarahumara, but these people have retained a separate identity. Tepóraca was executed by the Spanish in 1690. From 1696 to 1698, the Tarahumara again waged war against the Spanish, but were defeated. An important 1691 Jesuit report concerned the resistance of the Tarahumara to evangelization, &quot;Historia de la tercera rebelión tarahumara&quot;.

By 1753, the Jesuits turned over the lower Tarahumara missions to secular priests, and in 1767 the Jesuits were expelled from Spanish territories. Most missions in Tarahumara country ceased to operate or were turned over to Franciscans. Despite devoted and enthusiastic efforts, the Franciscans could not match the Jesuits’ feats, and the missions declined. The Jesuits reestablished the missions in the early 20th century.

== Culture ==
=== Athletic skills ===
The Tarahumara word for themselves, &quot;Rarámuri&quot;, means &quot;runners on foot&quot; or &quot;those who run fast&quot; in their native tongue according to some early ethnographers like Norwegian Carl Lumholtz, though this interpretation has not been fully agreed upon. With widely dispersed settlements, these people developed a tradition of long-distance running up to in one session, over a period of two days through their homeland of rough canyon country, for inter-village communication, transportation, and hunting.

The Tarahumaras&#x27; use of huaraches, their traditional form of sandals, when running has been the subject of scientific studies and journalistic discourse. In his book, &quot;Born to Run&quot;, author Christopher McDougall argues in favor of the endurance running hypothesis and the barefoot running movement based on his time with the Tarahumara people and their running in huaraches. Tarahumara sandals has become a byword in many US minimalist running circles with many companies starting since McDougall&#x27;s book popularized the style.

Their long-distance running tradition also has ceremonial and competitive aspects. Often, men kick wooden balls as they run in &quot;foot throwing&quot;, &quot;rarajipari&quot;, competitions, and women use a stick and hoop. The foot-throwing races are relays where the balls are kicked by the runners and relayed to the next runner while teammates run ahead to the next relay point. These races can last anywhere from a few hours to a couple of days without a break.
The Tarahumara commonly hunt with bow and arrows but are also known for their ability to run down deer and wild turkeys. Anthropologist Jonathan F. Cassel describes the Tarahumaras’ hunting abilities: &quot;the Tarahumara literally run the birds to death in what is referred to as persistence hunting. Forced into a rapid series of takeoffs, without sufficient rest periods between, the heavy-bodied bird does not have the strength to fly or run away from the Tarahumara hunter.&quot;

=== Religious beliefs ===
The Rarámuri religion is a mélange of Indigenous customs and Roman Catholicism. During the late 1600s and early 1700s, there was strong Jesuit mission activity, which was met by resistance. Later, when the Jesuit order was expelled, the Rarámuri were left free to interpret, modify, maintain or promulgate Catholic beliefs, symbols, and practices with little outside intervention .

While native religious elements have been maintained, there are Spanish Catholic ritual elements, demonstrating &quot;a genuine integration with vital cultural interests&quot;. The beings of most importance are: God (&quot;Riosi&quot;), God&#x27;s wife, who is the Christian Virgin Mary transformed, and the devil (&quot;Riablo)&quot;. &quot;Riosi&quot; is thought to be the Indigenous deity &quot;Onoruame&quot; (&quot;Great Father&quot;), and the Virgin Mary is &quot;Iyeruame&quot; (&quot;Great Mother&quot;). The Indigenous counterparts of Father-Sun and Mother-Moon overlap, respectively, with these concepts of God and God&#x27;s wife.

Another reported variation is that God has a wife who lives with him in heaven, along with their sons, the so-called &quot;sukristo&quot; (from Spanish &quot;Jesucristo&quot;) and their daughters, the &quot;Santi&quot;. These beings have a direct link with the physical world through Catholic iconography, crucifixes, and saints’ medallions, respectively.

Although &quot;Riablo&quot; aligns with the devil, the Rarámuri do not believe in a being that embodies Evil wholly. Instead it is tainted through its ties with the &quot;Chabochi&quot; (non-Rarámuri). The Devil is said to sometimes collaborate with God to arrange fitting punishments and can be appeased through sacrifices. In some cases, the Devil can be persuaded to act as a benevolent entity.

Some Rarámuri religious practices have the sense of &quot;konema&quot; (i.e., feeding God), the sense of returning to God a little of the much that he has given is prevalent.

Some Tarahumaras maintain a belief that the afterlife is a mirror image of the mortal world and that good deeds should be performed—not for spiritual reward—but for the improvement of life on earth.

The Rarámuri share with other Uto-Aztecan tribes a veneration of peyote.

=== Music ===
Music and dance are highly integrated into Tarahumara social life. The classical pianist Romayne Wheeler writes that &quot;Music sanctifies the moment in the life of all the Tarahumaras,&quot; and &quot;All of our actions have musical meaning.&quot; During the end of the year cycle, the Tarahumaras play violins which are masterfully carved but not varnished. The tunes are known as &quot;matachín&quot; pieces and are danced by dancers lavishly dressed in colorful attire resembling North African garments and accompanied by rattles (&quot;sáuraka&quot;). During Lent they play three-holed flutes of river cane, together with drums.

=== Clothing ===

=== Food ===
Staple crops of the Tarahumara are maize, beans, greens, squash, and tobacco. Chilli, potatoes, tomatoes, and sweet potatoes appear in Mexicanized regions. Corn is planted in February and March using oxen which are often loaned as not everyone owns one. Corn begins to flower in August; by November it is harvested and cooked or stored. Common corn dishes are &quot;pinole&quot;, tortillas, atole, tamales, and boiled and roasted ears. Beans are one of the Tarahumaras’ essential protein-rich foods and are usually served fried after being boiled. Tamales and beans are a common food that the Tarahumara carry with them on travels. Wheat and fruits were introduced by missionaries and are a minor source of nutrition. The fruits grown by the Tarahumara include apples, apricots, figs, and oranges.

The Tarahumaras also eat meat, but this constitutes less than 5% of their diet. Most of the meats that they consume are fish, chicken, and squirrels. On ceremonial occasions, domesticated animals such as cows, sheep, and goats are killed and eaten.
The Tarahumara practice persistence hunting of deer and wild turkeys by following them at a steady pace for one or two days until the animal drops from exhaustion.

According to William Connors, a dietary researcher, their traditional diet was found to be linked to their low incidence of diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes. However, the Tarahumaras&#x27; health is transitioning in regions where processed goods have begun to replace their traditional staples.

===Tesgüino and Tesgüinadas festivals===
&quot;Tesgüino&quot; is a fermented drink made year round from sprouted corn. Sometimes it is also made with still-green stalks, fruits of certain cactuses, shrubs, wheat, and trees when corn is sparse. The process begins by malting the corn and spreading it in a shallow basket covered with pine needles each day for four or five days. It is kept moist until the corn sprouts by which time the starch in the corn has been converted into smaller sugars. It is then mashed and boiled for eight hours. Varied herbs are ground up and mixed with water into a paste which is then fermented overnight by fire. Then the paste is combined with the corn liquid and fermented for another three to four days. Partaking of the alcoholic beverage usually takes place soon after its preparation, as the &quot;tesgüino&quot; can spoil within 24 hours.

Gatherings for celebrations, races, and religious ceremonies often take place with tesgüinadas, a Tarahumara-style beer festival. These gatherings take place all year round, but most happen in winter, and are the social events between the neighboring Tarahumara people. Tesgüinada events include rain fiestas, harvest ceremonies, curing fiestas, Guadalupe Fiesta, Holy Week, races, and Sunday gatherings. Some of these events take place during and after communal activities, for example when neighbors help one another&#x27;s families with their fields or build large structures like granaries, houses, and corrals. The harvest and rain ceremonies take place during the farming months to ensure a good crop season. These events also require either a shaman, &quot;curandero&quot;, or chanter. The job of the shaman and &quot;curandero&quot; are purely religious, as the &quot;curandero&quot; is there to diagnose and to heal the sick of the community, and chanters lead the tesgüinadas in chants and rhythms to accompany the ceremonies.

Tesgüinadas is an important aspect of Tarahumara culture as it is often the only time when men have intercourse with their wives. They act as social lubricants, as Tarahumara are very shy and private. Anthropologist John Kennedy describes the institution of tesgüinada as an important social fabric of Tarahumara culture which he calls the &quot;tesgüino network&quot;. He also states that &quot;the average Tarahumara spends at least 100 days per year directly concerned with tesgüino and much of this time under its influence or aftereffects.&quot;

The religious role of tesgüino is a very important aspect of tesgüinada. Before one can drink an olla of tesgüino they must dedicate it to Onorúame. During the curing ceremonies, the olla must rest in front of a cross until the ceremony is over. At age 14, a boy is allowed to drink tesgüino for the first time after a short sermon about his manly responsibilities. These rituals can sometimes last as long as 48 hours. Tesgüinadas are usually accompanied by dancing and the playing of fiddles, flutes, drums, and guitars.

=== Environmental factors ===

Logging has occurred since the end of the 1800s when the first loggers arrived. Later, the liberalization of laws in the 1990s resulted in the exhaustion of resources. In 1995, it was declared that &quot;after hundred years of logging, only two percent () of these unique forests remains&quot;, leaving one of the most biologically diverse ecosystems in North America, containing hundreds of medicinal plant, oak and pine species in danger of extinction. The Mexican Commission of Solidarity and Defense of Human Rights produced a report in 2000 noting the lack of studies by the government on how lumber production affected the ecosystem. Similarly, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) boosted foreign investment which resulted in the privatization of communal land and market-based mechanisms of environmental regulation.

In January 2017, Isidro Baldenegro López (2005 recipient of the Goldman Environmental Prize) a community leader of the Tarahumara, was shot and killed in Mexico. Baldenegro spent much of his life defending the ancient forests of the Sierra Madre region from the devastating effects of logging.

Drought has also been affecting the region for ten years and has worsened in recent years. During 2011, it was the driest year in Mexico on record, with just of rain, compared to a historical average of . The most severely hit area was the Sierra Madre region. Agricultural losses in Chihuahua are estimated at $25 million; 180,000 cattle have already died as a result of the growing lack of precipitation in the region.

Due to the lack of water, crops were destroyed and famine spread. Combined with the freezing temperatures of a cold front, living conditions have become poor for the Rarámuri. Their dependence on the environment worsens the situation, as they lack employment opportunities to generate income in non-farming activities. Moreover, increased contact with the outside world might be damaging as it creates dependency. These Indigenous people face extreme poverty, as reflected in the Mexican Human Development Index (HDI) which in the Sierra Madre is the lowest in the country: 49.1% below the national average. Alberto Herrera, the Mexican director of Amnesty International stated that the Indigenous people in his country have endured &quot;permanent discrimination, exclusion, and marginalization.&quot;

=== Mining ===
Mining dates to 950 AD with the Toltec and Mayan civilizations. Since the Spanish conquest, thousands of tons of mercury and lead have been released in the Mexican mining belt, which stretches from Oaxaca to Sonora in the northwest. The Sierra Madre part of this belt is one of the world&#x27;s most prolific gold and silver mining districts. Georgius Agricola mentioned in 1556 that mining led to deforestation, the disappearance of wildlife and watershed contamination. Large areas were deforested to exploit metal deposits. Reforms in the 1990s allowed foreign ownership and resulted in the reopening of mines and increased mining. According to the Secretaría de Economía, 204 mining companies with direct foreign investment had 310 ongoing projects in Mexico in 2006. In 2010, Mexico&#x27;s mining output reached high levels: 19% of the world&#x27;s silver production was extracted here, and the mining belt was the world&#x27;s most productive district as it was historically. The environmental impacts are dramatic, resulting in landscape change and the spread of heavy metals.

=== Effect of drug violence ===
Drug violence, cultivation and trade in this region have affected the lifestyle of the Rarámuri, given the proximity of the people and the Sierra Madre, one of the most productive drug-growing regions on Earth. Logging is not only controlled by the Mexican government but also practiced illegally by loggers and drug lords who use the forests to grow marijuana or opium or as space for their operations. Drug cartels usually have links with logging companies that launder money earned in the drug trade. Narco-trafficking weighs heavily on the Tarahumara, as the drug lords force the farmers to grow drugs instead of their own crops. Cartels have exploited the Tarahumaras&#x27; reputation as long-distance runners by forcing them into running illegal drugs into the United States.

== Forced displacement ==
The conditions of violence that are lived urge the Raramuri population to flee from their place of origin, often intimidated by criminal groups and extraction companies both Mexican and foreign.

=== Tourism ===
The remote terrain of the Sierra Madre has long served as a refuge for the Tarahumara. However, roads and tourism have expanded, bringing opportunities for some but problems for others. Ironically, the Rarámuri themselves seldom have sought this publicity. In the 1800s, attempts were made to build a railway. Currently, this line is used by the train Chihuahua Pacífico or El Chepe to transport tourists, lured by false representations of the area as pure and pristine, to sightseeing locales. It stops near many Tarahumara villages, attracting visitors expecting to see &quot;primitive natives&quot; (the legend of the Tarahumara). Along with new auto roads, railways built into the area have developed logging and tourism, which have accelerated the rate of modernization among the Rarámuri.

<doc id="263407" wikidata="Q1894844" url="?curid=263407" title="Margaret Gibson (writer)">
<text>Margaret Gibson (June 4, 1948 – February 25, 2006) was a Canadian novelist and short story writer who lived in Toronto, Ontario.

==Early life==
Born and raised in the Toronto suburb of Scarborough, the middle child of Audrey and Dane Gibson, Margaret Gibson began writing in the early 1970s to document her struggle with mental illness. Initially diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, she learned only during her divorce from her first husband that she had been misdiagnosed and was in fact bipolar.

She was married in the early 1970s to Stuart Gilboord, with whom she had one son, Aaron. Following her divorce from Gilboord, Gibson moved in with her longtime friend, actor and drag performer Craig Russell. Gibson and Gilboord&#x27;s custody battle for Aaron was portrayed in the 1994 television film &quot;For the Love of Aaron&quot;, in which Gibson was portrayed by actress Meredith Baxter.

==Writing career==
Gibson published &quot;The Butterfly Ward&quot;, her debut short story collection, in 1976. The book included the story &quot;Making It&quot;, based on her experiences living with Russell, which was later made into the feature film &quot;Outrageous!&quot; by director Richard Benner. Hollis McLaren played Liza Conners, the fictionalized version of Gibson, in that film. Benner also wrote and directed the sequel &quot;Too Outrageous!&quot; 10 years later. &quot;Ada&quot;, another story in the collection, was the basis of a CBC Television movie directed by Claude Jutra for the drama anthology series &quot;For the Record&quot;. It was Jutra&#x27;s first English-language film production. &quot;The Butterfly Ward&quot; was a winner of the City of Toronto Book Award in 1977, shared with Margaret Atwood&#x27;s novel &quot;Lady Oracle&quot;.

Gibson&#x27;s other short story collections include &quot;Considering Her Condition&quot; (1978), &quot;Sweet Poison&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Fear Room and Other Stories&quot; (1996). She published releasing her first and only novel &quot;Opium Dreams&quot; in 1997. &quot;Opium Dreams&quot; was a winner of the Books in Canada First Novel Award, and Gibson published her final short story collection &quot;Desert Thirst&quot; in 1998.

==Later years==
In later years, Gibson lived with Juris Rasa, her second husband. She died in 2006 of breast cancer at age 57.

==Works about Margaret Gibson==
Her friends, Stephen Jon Postal and his wife Guia Dino Postal, chronicled Gibson&#x27;s teenage life in the novel &quot;Of Margaret and Madness: A Novel Inspired by True Events&quot; ().

In 2011, Vassar College&#x27;s Powerhouse Theater produced David Solomon&#x27;s play &quot;Margaret and Craig&quot; in workshop. The play was based on the writing of Craig Russell and Margaret Gibson.

<doc id="263424" wikidata="Q185510" url="?curid=263424" title="Richard Hakluyt">
<text>Richard Hakluyt (; 1553 – 23 November 1616) was an English writer. He is known for promoting the English colonization of North America through his works, notably &quot;Divers Voyages Touching the Discoverie of America&quot; (1582) and &quot;The Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques and Discoveries of the English Nation&quot; (1589–1600).

Hakluyt was educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford. Between 1583 and 1588 he was chaplain and secretary to Sir Edward Stafford, English ambassador at the French court. An ordained priest, Hakluyt held important positions at Bristol Cathedral and Westminster Abbey and was personal chaplain to Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, principal Secretary of State to Elizabeth I and James I. He was the chief promoter of a petition to James I for letters patent to colonize Virginia, which were granted to the London Company and Plymouth Company (referred to collectively as the Virginia Company) in 1606. The Hakluyt Society, which publishes scholarly editions of primary records of voyages and travels, was named after him in its 1846 formation.

==Biography==
===Family, early life and education===
Hakluyt&#x27;s patrilineal ancestors were of Welsh extraction, rather than Dutch as is often suggested; they appear to have settled in Herefordshire in England around the 13th century, and, according to antiquary John Leland, took their surname from the &quot;Forest of Cluid in Radnorland.&quot; Some of Hakluyt&#x27;s ancestors established themselves at Yatton in Herefordshire, and must have ranked amongst the principal landowners of the county. A person named Hugo Hakelute, who may have been an ancestor or relative of Richard Hakluyt, was elected Member of Parliament for the borough of Yatton in 1304 or 1305, and between the 14th and 16th centuries five individuals surnamed &quot;de Hackluit&quot; or &quot;Hackluit&quot; were sheriffs of Herefordshire. A man named Walter Hakelut was knighted in the 34th year of Edward I (1305) and later killed at the Battle of Bannockburn, and in 1349 Thomas Hakeluyt was chancellor of the diocese of Hereford. Records also show that a Thomas Hakeluytt was in the wardship of Henry VIII (reigned 1509–1547) and Edward VI (reigned 1547–1553).

Richard Hakluyt, the second of four sons, was born in Eyton in Herefordshire in 1553. Hakluyt&#x27;s father, also named Richard Hakluyt, was a member of the Worshipful Company of Skinners whose members dealt in skins and furs. He died in 1557 when his son was aged about five years, and his wife Margery followed soon after. Hakluyt&#x27;s cousin, also named Richard Hakluyt, of the Middle Temple, became his guardian.

While a Queen&#x27;s Scholar at Westminster School, Hakluyt visited his guardian, whose conversation, illustrated by &quot;certain bookes of cosmographie, an universall mappe, and the Bible,&quot; made Hakluyt resolve to &quot;prosecute that knowledge, and kind of literature.&quot; Entering Christ Church, Oxford, in 1570 with financial support from the Skinners&#x27; Company, &quot;his exercises of duty first performed,&quot; he set out to read all the printed or written voyages and discoveries that he could find. He took his Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) on 19 February 1574, and shortly after taking his Master of Arts (M.A.) on 27 June 1577, began giving public lectures in geography. He was the first to show &quot;both the old imperfectly composed and the new lately reformed mappes, globes, spheares, and other instruments of this art.&quot; Hakluyt held on to his studentship at Christ Church between 1577 and 1586, although after 1583 he was no longer resident in Oxford.

Hakluyt was ordained in 1578, the same year he began to receive a &quot;pension&quot; from the Worshipful Company of Clothworkers to study divinity. The pension would have lapsed in 1583, but William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, intervened to have it extended until 1586 to aid Hakluyt&#x27;s geographical research.

===At the English Embassy in Paris===

Hakluyt&#x27;s first publication was one that he wrote himself, &quot;Divers Voyages Touching the Discoverie of America and the Ilands Adjacent unto the Same, Made First of all by our Englishmen and Afterwards by the Frenchmen and Britons&quot; (1582).

Hakluyt&#x27;s &quot;Voyages&quot; brought him to the notice of Lord Howard of Effingham, and Sir Edward Stafford, Lord Howard&#x27;s brother-in-law. At the age of 30, being acquainted with &quot;the chiefest captaines at sea, the greatest merchants, and the best mariners of our nation,&quot; he was selected as chaplain and secretary to accompany Stafford, now English ambassador at the French court, to Paris in 1583. In accordance with the instructions of Secretary Francis Walsingham, he occupied himself chiefly in collecting information of the Spanish and French movements, and &quot;making diligent inquirie of such things as might yield any light unto our westerne discoveries in America.&quot; Although this was his only visit to Continental Europe in his life, he was angered to hear the limitations of the English in terms of travel being discussed in Paris.

The first fruits of Hakluyt&#x27;s labours in Paris were embodied in his important work entitled &quot;A Particuler Discourse Concerninge the Greate Necessitie and Manifolde Commodyties That Are Like to Growe to This Realme of Englande by the Westerne Discoueries Lately Attempted, Written in the Yere 1584&quot;, which Sir Walter Raleigh commissioned him to prepare. The manuscript, lost for almost 300 years, was published for the first time in 1877. Hakluyt revisited England in 1584, and laid a copy of the &quot;Discourse&quot; before Elizabeth I (to whom it had been dedicated) together with his analysis in Latin of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Politicks&quot;. His objective was to recommend the enterprise of establishing English plantations in the region of North America not yet colonized by Europeans, and thus gain the Queen&#x27;s support for Raleigh&#x27;s expedition. In May 1585 when Hakluyt was in Paris with the English Embassy, the Queen granted to him the next prebendary at Bristol Cathedral that should become vacant, to which he was admitted in 1585 or 1586 and held with other preferments till his death.

Hakluyt&#x27;s other works during his time in Paris consisted mainly of translations and compilations, with his own dedications and prefaces. These latter writings, together with a few letters, are the only extant material out of which a biography of him can be framed. Hakluyt interested himself in the publication of the manuscript journal of René Goulaine de Laudonnière, &quot;L&#x27;histoire notable de la Floride située ès Indes Occidentales&quot; in Paris in 1586. The attention that the book excited in Paris encouraged Hakluyt to prepare an English translation and publish it in London under the title &quot;A Notable Historie Containing Foure Voyages Made by Certayne French Captaynes unto Florida&quot; (1587). The same year, his edition of Peter Martyr d&#x27;Anghiera&#x27;s &quot;De Orbe Nouo Decades Octo&quot; saw the light at Paris. This work contains an exceedingly-rare copperplate map dedicated to Hakluyt and signed F.G. (supposed to be Francis Gualle); it is the first on which the name &quot;Virginia&quot; appears.

===Return to England===

In 1588 Hakluyt finally returned to England with Douglas Sheffield, Baroness Sheffield, after a residence in France of nearly five years. In 1589 he published the first edition of his chief work, &quot;The Principall Navigations, Voiages and Discoveries of the English Nation&quot;, using eyewitness accounts as far as possible. In the preface to this he announced the intended publication of the first terrestrial globe made in England by Emery Molyneux.

Between 1598 and 1600 appeared the final, reconstructed and greatly enlarged edition of &quot;The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation&quot; in three volumes. In the dedication of the second volume (1599) to his patron, Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, Hakluyt strongly urged the minister as to the expediency of colonising Virginia. A few copies of this monumental work contain a map of great rarity, the first on the Mercator projection made in England according to the true principles laid down by Edward Wright. Hakluyt&#x27;s great collection has been called &quot;the Prose Epic of the modern English nation&quot; by historian James Anthony Froude.

On 20 April 1590 Hakluyt was instituted to the clergy house of Wetheringsett-cum-Brockford, Suffolk, by Lady Stafford, who was the Dowager Baroness Sheffield. He held this position until his death, and resided in Wetheringsett through the 1590s and frequently thereafter. In 1599, he became an adviser to the newly-founded East India Company, and in 1601 he edited a translation from the Portuguese of Antonio Galvão&#x27;s &quot;The Discoveries of the World&quot;.
===Later life===
In the late 1590s Hakluyt became the client and personal chaplain of Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, Lord Burghley&#x27;s son, who was to be Hakluyt&#x27;s most fruitful patron. Hakluyt dedicated to Cecil the second (1599) and third volumes (1600) of the expanded edition of &quot;Principal Navigations&quot; and also his edition of Galvão&#x27;s &quot;Discoveries&quot; (1601). Cecil, who was the principal Secretary of State to Elizabeth I and James I, rewarded him by installing him as prebendary of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster on 4 May 1602. In the following year, he was elected archdeacon of the Abbey. These religious occupations have occasioned reconsideration of the role played by spiritual concerns in Hakluyt&#x27;s writings on exploration, settlement, and England&#x27;s relations with its Catholic rivals.

Hakluyt was married twice, once in or about 1594 and again in 1604. In the licence of Hakluyt&#x27;s second marriage dated 30 March 1604, he is described as one of the chaplains of the Savoy Hospital; this position was also conferred on him by Cecil. His will refers to chambers occupied by him there up to the time of his death, and in another official document he is styled Doctor of Divinity (D.D.).

Hakluyt was also a leading adventurer of the Charter of the Virginia Company of London as a director thereof in 1589. In 1605 he secured the prospective living of Jamestown, the intended capital of the intended colony of Virginia. When the colony was at last established in 1607, he supplied this benefice with its chaplain, Robert Hunt. In 1606 he appears as the chief promoter of the petition to James I for letters patent to colonise Virginia, which were granted on 10 April 1606. His last publication was a translation of Hernando de Soto&#x27;s discoveries in Florida, entitled &quot;Virginia Richly Valued, by the Description of the Maine Land of Florida, Her Next Neighbour&quot; (1609). This work was intended to encourage the young colony of Virginia; Scottish historian William Robertson wrote of Hakluyt, &quot;England is more indebted for its American possessions than to any man of that age.&quot;

Hakluyt prepared an English translation of Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius&#x27; &quot;Mare Liberum&quot; (1609), a treatise that sought to demonstrate that the Dutch had the right to trade freely in the East Indies, contrary to Spanish and Portuguese claims of sovereignty over the seas, in the early 17th century. Helen Thornton has suggested that the translation was commissioned by Thomas Smythe who became treasurer of the Virginia Company in 1609 and was also Governor of the East India Company. In that year, Hakluyt was a consultant to the Company when it was renewing its charter. Grotius&#x27; arguments supported England&#x27;s right to trade in the Indies. The translation may also have been part of the propaganda encouraging English people to settle in Virginia. In &quot;Mare Liberum&quot;, Grotius denied that the 1493 donation by Pope Alexander VI that had divided the oceans between Spain and Portugal entitled Spain to make territorial claims to North America. Instead, he stressed the importance of occupation, which was favourable to the English as they and not the Spanish had occupied Virginia. Grotius also argued that the seas should be freely navigable by all, which was useful since the England to Virginia route crossed seas which the Portuguese claimed. However, it is not clear why Hakluyt&#x27;s translation was not published in his lifetime. George Bruner Parks has theorized that publication at that time would have been inconvenient to England because after England had successfully helped Holland and Spain to negotiate the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce during the Eighty Years&#x27; War, the work would have supported English claims for free seas against Spain, but not its claims for closed seas against Holland. Hakluyt&#x27;s handwritten manuscript, MS Petyt 529, in Inner Temple Library in London was eventually published as &quot;The Free Sea&quot; for the first time in 2004.
In 1591, Hakluyt inherited family property upon the death of his elder brother Thomas; a year later, upon the death of his youngest brother Edmund, he inherited additional property which derived from his uncle. In 1612 Hakluyt became a charter member of the North-west Passage Company. By the time of his death, he had amassed a small fortune out of his various emoluments and , of which the last was the clergy house of Gedney, Lincolnshire, presented to him by his younger brother Oliver in 1612. Unfortunately, his wealth was squandered by his only son.

Hakluyt died on 23 November 1616, probably in London, and was buried on 26 November in Westminster Abbey; by an error in the abbey register his burial is recorded under the year 1626. A number of his manuscripts, sufficient to form a fourth volume of his collections of 1598–1600, fell into the hands of Samuel Purchas, who inserted them in an abridged form in his &quot;Pilgrimes&quot; (1625–1626). Others, consisting chiefly of notes gathered from contemporary authors, are preserved at the University of Oxford.

Hakluyt is principally remembered for his efforts in promoting and supporting the settlement of North America by the English through his writings. These works were a fertile source of material for William Shakespeare and other authors. Hakluyt also encouraged the production of geographical and historical writings by others. It was at Hakluyt&#x27;s suggestion that Robert Parke translated Juan González de Mendoza&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Great and Mighty Kingdom of China and the Situation Thereof&quot; (1588–1590), John Pory made his version of Leo Africanus&#x27;s &quot;A Geographical Historie of Africa&quot; (1600), and P. Erondelle translated Marc Lescarbot&#x27;s &quot;Nova Francia&quot; (1609).

==Legacy==
The Hakluyt Society was founded in 1846 for printing rare and unpublished accounts of voyages and travels, and continues to publish volumes each year.

As of 2018, a 14-volume critical edition of Hakluyt&#x27;s &quot;Principal Navigations&quot; was being prepared by the Hakluyt Edition Project for Oxford University Press under the general editorship of Daniel Carey, National University of Ireland, Galway, and Claire Jowitt, University of East Anglia.

Westminster School named a house after him as recognition of achievement of an Old Westminster.

In Svalbard (Spitsbergen), the Hakluythovden headland and Hakluytodden landspit in the northwestern region of Amsterdam Island are named after Richard Hakluyt.

<text>Hector Boece (; also spelled Boyce or Boise; 1465–1536), known in Latin as Hector Boecius or Boethius, was a Scottish philosopher and historian, and the first Principal of King&#x27;s College in Aberdeen, a predecessor of the University of Aberdeen.

==Biography==
He was born in Dundee where he attended school and was educated at the nearby University of St Andrews. Later he left to study at the University of Paris where he met Erasmus, with whom he became close friends while they were both students at the austere Collège de Montaigu, to whose reforming Master, Jan Standonck, Boece later became Secretary. By 1497 he had become a professor of philosophy at Collège de Montaigu.

In 1500, he was induced to leave Paris for Aberdeen by a generously financed offer to become the first principal of the newly established University of Aberdeen, created at the behest of James IV by William Elphinstone, Bishop of Aberdeen under the authority of a Papal bull issued by Pope Alexander VI.

From then onwards, he worked closely with Elphinstone, to set up the new university and by 1505, regular lectures were taking place at King&#x27;s College. The university structure was modelled on those of Paris and of Orléans. As intended, Boece was installed as the first principal of the university and gave lectures on medicine and on divinity.

At the end of 1534, Boece became Rector of Fyvie. He died in Aberdeen two years later at the age of 71.

==Works==
Boece wrote and published two books, one of biography and one of history. In 1522 he published the &quot;Vitae Episcoporum Murthlacensium et Aberdonensium&quot; &quot;(Lives of the Bishops of Murthlack and Aberdeen&quot;) and in 1527 the &quot;Historia Gentis Scotorum&quot; (&quot;History of the Scottish People&quot;) to the accession of James III of Scotland. The former was the basis of a poem in Scots by Alexander Gardyne.

===Reception of the &quot;Historia&quot;===
The &quot;Historia&quot; is the work for which Boece is remembered, as the second scholarly history of the Scots to be written; its only real predecessor was the compendium of John Mair. It was written in a flowing and pleasing style, became popular, and led to ecclesiastical preferment and royal favour. By modern standards, it is overly patriotic, and has many inaccuracies. The historical account of Macbeth of Scotland, in particular, flattered the antecedents of Boece&#x27;s patron King James IV of Scotland, and greatly maligned the real Macbeth. The work was well received at the time, both in Europe and in Scotland, after its translation from Latin into French and then in 1536 from Latin into Scots by John Bellenden. There are some interesting glimpses in the &quot;Historia&quot; of contemporary Scotland, such as the statement that the Eurasian beaver, which was soon to become extinct in Scotland, was still common around Loch Ness.

===Continuations of the &quot;Historia&quot; and its influence===
Boece&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot; as published terminated its coverage of history at the year 1438. In the early 1530s the scholar Giovanni Ferrerio, engaged by Robert Reid of Kinloss Abbey, wrote a continuation of Boece&#x27;s history, extending it another 50 years, to the end of the reign of James III. John Lesley in his &quot;De Origine, Moribus, et Rebus Gestis Scotorum&quot;, and Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, provided further continuations. The metrical translation into Scots by William Stewart, not published until the nineteenth century, also provided some expansion.

The chronicler Polydore Vergil made some use of Boece for his 1534 &quot;Historia Anglica&quot;. David Chalmers of Ormond in his &quot;Histoire abbregée&quot; (1572) wrote about the French, English and Scottish monarchies, relying on Boece for the Scottish account. The &quot;Historia&quot; was translated into English for Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland&quot;. The account in Holinshed&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; was then used by William Shakespeare as the basis of his play &quot;Macbeth&quot;. George Buchanan made heavy use of Boece in his &quot;Rerum Scoticarum Historia&quot; (1582).

===Boece&#x27;s sources===
Boece&#x27;s claimed sources fell into three classes. The works of John Fordun (&quot;Chronica Gentis Scotorum&quot;) and Walter Bower (&quot;Scotichronicon&quot;) defined the tradition which he attempted to make seamless, filling the gaps in the chronicle, and applying the approach common to humanists of his period. The works of Tacitus had been rediscovered, in the 14th century, and contained material relevant to British history; and Boece was concerned to integrate it into the tradition. Finally, there was a group of sources that remain debated: material from Elphinstone, and the authors Veremundus, Cornelius Hibernicus, and John Campbell. No written record of these works survives.

Sharp criticism of the sourcing of Boece&#x27;s history was voiced in the sixteenth century by Humphrey Lhuyd and John Twyne. In the eighteenth century, the historical content of the earlier parts of it was effectively dismantled by Thomas Innes.

Boece shared in the credulity of his age; the approach of Mair, who was writing in parallel at the same time, but with a different focus and with a more critical and less sweeping method, did not represent the current fashion. The charge of actually inventing his authorities, formerly brought against Boece, has been the subject of recent scholarship. One example of Boece being cleared of the charge of fabricating his work concerns the Battle of Luncarty, Luncarty, Clan Hay. He was suspected by the Scottish historian John Hill Burton of inventing that battle but, Walter Bower writing in his &quot;Scotichronicon&quot; around 1440, some 87 years before Boece first published his &quot;Scotorum Historia&quot;, refers to the battle briefly. The &quot;John Campbell&quot; is tentatively identified as Boece&#x27;s contemporary John Campbell of Lundie (died 1562). &quot;Veremundus&quot;, it is argued, may be a Richard Vairement of the 13th century.

<text>Robert Armin (c. 1568 – 1615) was an English actor, and member of the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men. He became the leading comedy actor with the troupe associated with William Shakespeare following the departure of Will Kempe around 1600. Also a popular comic author, he wrote a comedy, &quot;The History of the Two Maids of More-clacke&quot;, as well as &quot;Foole upon Foole&quot;, &quot;A Nest of Ninnies&quot; (1608) and &quot;The Italian Taylor and his Boy&quot;.

Armin changed the part of the clown or fool from the rustic servingman turned comedian to that of a high-comedy domestic wit.

==Early life==
:&quot;…the clown is wise because he plays the fool for money, while others have to pay for the same privilege.&quot; – Leslie Hotson in &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Motley&quot;

Armin was one of three children born to John Armyn II of King&#x27;s Lynn, a tailor and friend to John Lonyson, a goldsmith also of King&#x27;s Lynn. His brother, John Armyn III, was a merchant tailor in London. Armin did not take up his father&#x27;s craft; instead, his father apprenticed him to Lonyson in the Goldsmiths&#x27; Company in 1581. Lonyson was the Master of Works at the Royal Mint in the Tower of London, a position of great responsibility. The arrangement moved Armin to a life and a social circle quite different from what he might have expected as a Norfolk tailor. Lonyson died in 1582, and the apprenticeship was transferred to another master. According to a tale preserved in &quot;Tarlton&#x27;s Jests&quot;, Armin came to the attention of the Queen&#x27;s jester Richard Tarlton. In the course of his duties, the story contends, Armin was sent to collect money from a lodger at Tarlton&#x27;s inn. Frustrated by the man&#x27;s refusal to pay, Armin wrote verses in chalk on the wall; Tarlton noticed and, approving their wit, wrote an answer in which he expressed a desire to take Armin as his apprentice. Though not corroborated, this anecdote is far from the least plausible in &quot;Tarlton&#x27;s Jests&quot;. Influenced by Tarlton or not, Armin already had a literary reputation before he finished his apprenticeship in 1592. In 1590, his name is affixed to the preface of a religious tract, &quot;A Brief Resolution of the Right Religion&quot;. Two years later, both Thomas Nashe (in &quot;Strange News&quot;) and Gabriel Harvey (in &quot;Pierce&#x27;s Supererogation&quot;) mention him as a writer of ballads; none of his work in this vein, however, is known to have survived.

==The Chandos company==
At some point in the 1590s, Armin joined a company of players patronised by William Brydges, 4th Baron Chandos. With this company, about which little is known, he is presumed to have travelled from the western Midlands to East Anglia. The nature of his work for the company may be estimated from his parts in &quot;The History of the Two Maids of More-clacke&quot;. The preface to the 1609 quarto indicates that he played Blue John, a clown in the vein of Tarlton and Kempe; he also seems to have doubled in the role of Tutch, a witty fool of the type he later played in London. The late quarto is associated with a revival by the King&#x27;s Revels Children, a short-lived troupe of boy players led by Nathan Field, but it was almost certainly written around 1597.

Little else is known precisely of Armin&#x27;s time with Chandos&#x27;s Men. A dedication to his patron&#x27;s widow in 1604 suggests some personal acquaintance with the Brydges family; on the other hand, a reference in another work suggests he may have spent some time, like Kempe, as a solo performer. The pair of books Armin published around the turn of the century demonstrate a performer with an interest in his craft. &quot;Fool Upon Fool&quot; (1600, 1605; reissued in 1608 as &quot;A Nest of Ninnies&quot;), offers the wit of assorted natural fools, some of whom Armin knew personally. The same year he published &quot;Quips upon Questions&quot;, a collection of seemingly extemporaneous dialogues with his marotte, named by him Signor Truncheon. In this he demonstrates his style; instead of having a conversation with the audience, as Tarlton did, and entering into a battle of wits, he jests using multiple personas, improvised song, or by commenting on a person or event. Rather than exchanging words, he gave words freely. Armin reported in that work that on either Tuesday 25 December 1599, or Tuesday 1 January 1600, he would be travelling to Hackney to wait on his &quot;right honourable good lord&quot;. This was possibly Baron Chandos, who may have been visiting Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche over the holidays, or more likely Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford who lived in Hackney.

The first editions of these two books were credited to &quot;Clonnico de Curtanio Snuffe&quot;—that is, to the &quot;Clown of the Curtain&quot;. The 1605 edition changes &quot;Curtain&quot; to &quot;Mundo&quot; (that is, Globe); only in 1608 was he credited by name, though the earlier title pages would have sufficed to identify him for Londoners.

Another work of uncertain date (it was published in 1609) is &quot;The Italian Tailor and his Boy&quot;. A translation of a tale from Gianfrancesco Straparola, the subject matter may reflect his family background of tailors. He was a tailor&#x27;s son, who paralleled in the Italian tailor&#x27;s apprentice, and the ruby ring of the play&#x27;s lore parallels the goldsmith apprentice.

Sutcliffe argues that Armin wrote a pamphlet published in 1599, &quot;A Pil to Purge Melancholie&quot;, on the grounds that it was published by the same press, mentions a clown with Armin&#x27;s nickname, and contains verbal echoes of &quot;Two Maids of More-clacke&quot;.

==Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men==
The timing of Armin&#x27;s joining the Chamberlain&#x27;s Men is as mysterious as its occasion. That it was connected to Kempe&#x27;s departure has been generally accepted; however, the reasons for that departure are not clear. One traditional view—that the company in general or Shakespeare specifically had begun to tire of Kempe&#x27;s old-fashioned clowning—is still current, though the main evidence for this view consists of Kempe&#x27;s departure and the type of comic roles Shakespeare wrote after 1600. Armin played on the Globe stage by August 1600; Wiles theorizes that he may have joined the Chamberlain&#x27;s Men in 1599, but continued to perform solo pieces at the Curtain; however, he may also have played with the company at the Curtain, while Kempe was still a member.

Armin is generally credited with all the &quot;licensed fools&quot; in the repertory of the Chamberlain&#x27;s and King&#x27;s Men: Touchstone in &quot;As You Like It&quot;, Feste in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, the Fool in &quot;King Lear&quot;, Lavatch in &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot;, and perhaps Thersites in &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, the Porter in &quot;Macbeth&quot;, the Fool in &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;, and Autolycus in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;. Of these eight, Touchstone is the fool about which there is the most critical discussion. Harold Bloom describes him as &quot;rancidly vicious,&quot; and writes that &quot;this more intense rancidity works as a touchstone should, to prove the true gold of Rosalind&#x27;s spirit&quot;. John Palmer disagrees and writes that &quot;he must be either a true cynic or one that affects his cynicism to mask a fundamentally genial spirit&quot;. As Palmer continues, a true cynic does not belong in Arden, so the clown &quot;must be a thoroughly good fellow at heart&quot;. Touchstone affects the front of a malcontented cynic, thus serving as proof of Rosalind&#x27;s quick wit. When she confronts both Jaques and Touchstone, she exposes their silliness and prevents the fools from making Arden out to be worse than it really is.

Feste was almost certainly written for Armin, as he is a scholar, a singer, and a wit. Feste&#x27;s purpose is to reveal the foolishness of those around him. Lear&#x27;s fool differs from both Touchstone and Feste as well as from other clowns of his era. Touchstone and Feste are philosopher-fools; Lear&#x27;s fool is the natural fool of whom Armin studied and wrote. Armin here had the opportunity to display his studies. The fool speaks the prophecy lines, which he tells—largely ignored—to Lear before disappearing from the play altogether. Lear&#x27;s fool is hardly around for entertainment purposes; rather, he is present to forward the plot, remain loyal to the king, and perhaps to stall his madness.

Although Armin typically played these intelligent clown roles, it has been suggested by a few scholars that he originated the role of Iago in &quot;Othello&quot;, on the grounds that Iago sings two drinking songs (most of the songs in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays from 1600 to 1610 were sung by Armin&#x27;s characters) and that this was the sole play between &quot;As You Like It&quot; and &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; that has no fool or clown for Armin to play. An alternative suggestion, however, is that Iago was originally acted by John Lowin, with Armin instead taking the smaller part of Othello&#x27;s servant.

In non-Shakespearean roles, he probably played Pasarello in John Marston&#x27;s &quot;The Malcontent&quot;; indeed, Marston may have added the part for him when the play was produced by the King&#x27;s Men. Armin appears in the cast list for Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;The Alchemist&quot;; he may have played Drugger. He is also presumed to have been the clown in George Wilkins&#x27;s &quot;The Miseries of Enforced Marriage&quot;.

He is not named in the cast list for Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Catiline&quot; (1611), and other evidence suggests that he retired in 1609 or 1610. The preface to the &quot;Two Maids&quot; quarto confides, &quot;I would have again enacted John myself, but &quot;tempora mutantur in illis&quot;, and I cannot do as I would&quot;. He was buried in late 1615.

In London, he resided in the parish of St Botolph&#x27;s Aldgate; three of his children named in the parish register appear to have died before adulthood. Fellow King&#x27;s Man Augustine Phillips bequeathed him twenty shillings as a &quot;fellow&quot;; John Davies of Hereford wrote Armin a complimentary epigram. His burial is recorded in the Registers of St Botolph&#x27;s as 30 November 1615.

==A new fool==
Armin may have played a key role in the development of Shakespearian fools. &quot;If any player breathed,&quot; Hotson tells us, &quot;who could explore with Shakespeare the shadows and fitful flashes of the borderland of insanity, that player was Armin&quot;. Robert Armin explored every aspect of the clown, from the natural idiot to the philosopher-fool; from serving man to retained jester. In study, writing, and performance, Armin moved the fool from rustic zany to trained motley. His characters—those he wrote and those he acted—absurdly point out the absurdity of what is otherwise called normal. Instead of appealing to the identity of the English commoner by imitating them, he created a new fool, a high-comic jester for whom wisdom is wit and wit is wisdom.
When Robert Armin replaced Kemp in the Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, it was considered the &quot;taming of the clown&quot;. Armin&#x27;s new style of comedy brought into play the &quot;world-wisely fool&quot;. This urged Shakespeare to create Feste in his &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, who was a philosophical social insurgence. He had a place everywhere, but belonged nowhere.
Ken Kesey, in an interview, summarizes Armin&#x27;s ideas about the two kinds of fool: &quot;That fool of Shakespeare&#x27;s, the actor Robert Armin [a mistake for Will Kempe who is widely believed to have played Falstaff], became so popular that finally Shakespeare wrote him out of Henry IV. In a book called &quot;A Nest of Ninnies&quot;, Armin wrote about the difference between a fool artificial and a fool natural. And the way Armin defines the two is important: the character Jack Oates is a true fool natural. He never stops being a fool to save himself; he never tries to do anything but anger his master, Sir William. A fool artificial is always trying to please; he’s a lackey.&quot;

His works were in 1880 published as &quot;The works of Robert Armin , actor, (1605-1609)&quot; (ed. by A.B. Grosart)

<text>Belikin is the leading domestically produced beer brand in Belize.

== Name Origin ==
The root of the name “Belikin” dates to the ancient Maya Classical Period and is an amalgamation of several Mayan words with the meaning either ‘road to the east’ or ‘road to the burning sun.’ Both meanings refer to the eastward expansion of the Maya toward Belize. Many believe that the ancient Maya called this land Belikin. 

Belikin was selected from a nationwide naming contest. 

bih elk’in - meaning “road to the east” 
Belikin is brewed by the Belize Brewing Company, Ltd. which is owned by the Bowen family. The Belize Brewing Company was established in 1969, and began brewing Belikin Beer and Belikin Stout brand name in 1971. Its tagline is &quot;The Beer of Belize&quot;.

The name &quot;Belikin&quot; comes from the Maya language and means &quot;Route to the East&quot;. This is a term which some have suggested is the origin of the name of &quot;Belize&quot; (although the most accepted derivation says the name comes from the Belize River, meaning &quot;muddy&quot;). The Belikin label features a drawing of a Pre-Columbian Maya temple-pyramid at Altun Ha.

The most common Belikin is a light lager beer. Lighthouse Lager, Belikin Premium and a stout beer are also brewed and sold under the Belikin name.

The brewery is based in Ladyville, Belize District.

<doc id="263455" wikidata="Q363383" url="?curid=263455" title="Armand Hammer">
<text>Armand Hammer (May 21, 1898 – December 10, 1990) was an American business manager and owner. He spent decades with Occidental Petroleum in the mid 20th century. Called &quot;Lenin&#x27;s chosen capitalist&quot; by the press, he was also known for his art collection and his close ties to the Soviet Union.

Hammer&#x27;s business interests around the world and his &quot;citizen diplomacy&quot; helped him cultivate a wide network of friends and associates.
==Early life==
Armand Hammer was born in New York City to Rose (&quot;née&quot; Lipschitz) and Julius Hammer. Rose and Julius Hammer were Jewish emigrants from the Russian Empire, from Vitebsk (now in Belarus) and Odesa (now in Ukraine), respectively. Julius Hammer came to the United States in 1875 and settled in the Bronx, where he ran a general medical practice and five drugstores.

Following the Russian Revolution, a part of the Socialist Labor Party of America (SLP) under Julius&#x27; leadership split off to become a founding element of the Communist Party USA, which supported Vladimir Lenin and Bolshevism. As the administrative head, commercial &quot;attaché&quot;, and financial advisor of the Ludwig Martens-led Russian Soviet Government Bureau, Julius Hammer was assigned to generate support for the Russian Soviet Government Bureau and funded the Soviet Russian Bureau by money laundering the proceeds from illegal sales of smuggled diamonds through his company Allied Drug, while his Allied Drug partner, Abraham A. Heller, headed the Soviet Bureau&#x27;s commercial department. Julius Hammer and Heller traveled extensively across the United States to stop the embargo of Soviet Russia and to increase United States trade with Soviet Russia and improve the image of Bolsheviks, whom American socialists despised overwhelmingly. During the United States embargo against Soviet Russia, Julius Hammer used his Allied Drug and Chemical as a front to smuggle items and materials between the United States and Soviet Russia through Riga. After the Lusk Committee supported the police raid of the Soviet Russian Government Bureau on June 12, 1919, Ludwig Martens escaped and went underground, often hiding at Hammer&#x27;s home. On December 18, 1920, Martens was deported; he was returned to Soviet Russia in January 1921.

Hammer said originally that his father had named him after a character, Armand Duval, in &quot;La Dame aux Camélias&quot;, a novel by Alexandre Dumas. According to other sources, Hammer later was said to be named after the &quot;arm and hammer&quot; graphic symbol of the SLP, in which his father had a leadership role. Late in his life, Hammer confirmed that the latter story contained the true origin of his given name.

===Father&#x27;s imprisonment===
Due to his socialist and communist activities, Hammer&#x27;s father Julius had been put under federal surveillance. On July 5, 1919, federal agents witnessed Marie Oganesoff (the 33-year-old Russian wife of a former tsarist diplomat) entering Julius&#x27;s medical office located in a wing of his Bronx home. Oganesoff, &quot;who had accumulated a life-threatening history of miscarriages, abortions, and poor health, was pregnant and wanted to terminate her pregnancy.&quot; The surgical procedure took place in the midst of a great flu epidemic. Six days after the abortion, Oganesoff died of pneumonia. Four weeks after her death, a Bronx County grand jury indicted Julius Hammer for first-degree manslaughter. The following summer, a criminal prosecutor convinced a jury that Julius Hammer had let his patient &quot;die like a dog&quot; and that the claims that she had actually died from complications due to influenza were mere attempts to cover up his crime. In 1920, a judge sentenced Julius Hammer to three and a half years in Sing Sing prison.

While most historians (such as Beverly Gage and Nigel West) state that Julius had performed the abortion, an opposing position has been put forward by author Edward Jay Epstein, who in his book &quot;Dossier: The Secret History of Armand Hammer&quot; puts forward the claim that it was Armand Hammer, then a medical student, rather than his father, who performed the abortion and his father Julius assumed the blame. Epstein&#x27;s claims come from interview comments made by Bettye Murphy, who had been Armand&#x27;s mistress. According to Murphy and Epstein&#x27;s account, the legal strategy was that Julius did not deny that an abortion had been performed, but insisted that it had been medically necessary and that a licensed doctor, rather than a medical student, would be more convincing in presenting that argument.

===Allied Drug===
After the Soviet Russian Government Bureau closed, Allied Drug&#x27;s smuggling activities between the United States and Soviet Union ceased, which caused Allied Drug to gain enormous debts from storing large amounts of unpaid items in warehouses in New York and Riga. In March 1921, Ludwig Martens sent a letter from Moscow through the Soviet mission in Tallinn to Julius Hammer, who was imprisoned at Sing Sing until 1924, granting his Allied Drug and Chemical concessions for trade with the Soviets and requested an Allied Drug representative to be present in the Soviet Union.

When his father was imprisoned, Hammer and his brother took Allied Drug, the family business, to new heights, reselling equipment they had bought at depressed prices at the end of World War I. According to Hammer, his first business success was in 1919, manufacturing and selling a ginger extract, which legally contained high levels of alcohol. This was extremely popular during Prohibition, and the company had $1 million in sales that year.

===Family envoy in Soviet Union===
While Julius was imprisoned, he sent Armand Hammer, who could not speak any Russian, to the Soviet Union to look after the affairs of Allied Drug and Chemical. Hammer traveled back and forth from the Soviet Union for the next 10 years. In the meantime, Hammer graduated from Columbia College in 1919 and received his medical degree from the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1921.

In 1921, while waiting for his internship to begin at Bellevue Hospital, Hammer went to the Soviet Union for a trip that lasted until late 1930. Although his career in medicine was cut short, he relished being referred to as &quot;Dr. Hammer&quot;. Hammer&#x27;s intentions in the 1921 trip have been debated ever since. He has claimed that he originally intended to recoup $150,000 in debts for drugs shipped during the Allied intervention, but was soon moved by a capitalistic and philanthropic interest in selling wheat to the then-starving Russians. In his passport application, Hammer stated that he intended to visit only Western Europe. J. Edgar Hoover in the Justice Department knew this was false, but Hammer was allowed to travel, anyway. The 26-year-old Hoover, who was the Justice Department&#x27;s expert on subversives, was tipped off that Armand Hammer was a courier for the COMINTERN and ensured that foreign intelligence agencies were notified of Armand Hammer&#x27;s travels. A skeptical U.S. government watched him through this trip and for the rest of his life.

==Career==

=== Early Soviet ventures ===

==== First trip to Russia ====
After leaving Columbia Medical School, Hammer extended earlier entrepreneurial ventures with a successful business importing many goods from and exporting pharmaceuticals to the newly formed Soviet Union, together with his younger brother Victor. The blockade of Soviet Russia had ended for most items in February 1921, and on July 5, 1921, he departed New York on his first trip to Soviet Russia as Allied Drug&#x27;s representative in Soviet Russia. Prior to his departure, he visited Charles Recht, Lenin&#x27;s United States attorney that supported Soviet Russia&#x27;s best interests in the United States and whose law office was in the same building that the former Soviet Russian Government Bureau had occupied, and Recht gave Hammer a package to deliver to Ludwig Martens in Moscow. During this first visit, Armand Hammer allowed the Cheka, the Soviet secret police who later became known as the KGB, to take control of Allied Drug and Chemical.

==== Asbestos concession ====
During his time in Soviet Russia and later the Soviet Union, he perfected bribery and money-laundering techniques, which were exposed later in the 1960s and 1970s during which he tape-recorded his payoffs. After returning to the United States, Hammer stated that Lenin had granted him an asbestos concession for 25 years to mine asbestos from the Urals in Soviet Russia. According to Hammer, on his initial trip, he took $60,000 in medical supplies to aid in a typhus epidemic and made a deal with Lenin for furs, caviar, and jewelry expropriated by the Soviet state in exchange for a million bushels (27,216 tons) shipment of surplus American wheat.

==== Lenin New Economic Policy ====
During Lenin&#x27;s New Economic Policy, Armand Hammer became the mediator for 38 international companies in their dealings with the USSR. Before Lenin&#x27;s death, Hammer negotiated the import of Fordson tractors into the USSR, which served a major role in agricultural mechanization in the country. Later, after Stalin came to power, additional deals were negotiated with Hammer as an American–Soviet negotiator.

==== Hammer&#x27;s move to Soviet Union ====
He moved to the USSR in the 1920s to oversee these operations, especially his large business manufacturing and exporting pens and pencils. According to Alexander Barmine, who was assigned by the Central Committee to run the Mezhdunarodnaya Kniga company to compete with Hammer, the stationery concession to produce such items in the Soviet Union was actually granted to Julius Hammer. Barmine states the party spent five million gold rubles on stationery supplies made in factories controlled by Julius Hammer and other concessionaires, making them rich. Barmine further contends that the Soviets were eventually able to duplicate certain items such as typewriter parts and pens, and end those concessions, but were never able to match the quality of Hammer&#x27;s pencils, so that concession became permanent. Armand Hammer remained in the Soviet Union until 1930.

=== Return to the United States ===
Back in the United States, Hammer was bequeathed a few Fabergé eggs by the Soviets between 1930 and 1933. The authenticity of the artifacts was questioned. According to Géza von Habsburg, Armand&#x27;s brother Victor Hammer stated Stalin&#x27;s trade commissar Anastas Mikoyan provided Fabergé hallmarking tools to Armand to sell fakes, and Victor stated a 1938 New York sale he ran with Armand, which grossed several million dollars, consisted of both authentic and inauthentic items (called Fauxbergé by Habsburg), with commissions going back to Mikoyan. Although certainly some fakes were produced, on close examination many of the so-called fake items turned out to actually be from various workshops, particularly that of Henrik Wigstrom, and had been appropriated by the Soviet government when they closed the Faberge company. As the items were either unfinished or not ready for retail sale, many were not hallmarked, so Hammer and his associates finished the work.

In his 1983 book, &quot;Red Carpet,&quot; author Joseph Finder discusses Hammer&#x27;s &quot;extensive involvement with Russia.&quot; In &quot;Dossier: The Secret History of Armand Hammer&quot;, Edward Jay Epstein called Hammer &quot;a virtual spy&quot; for the Soviet Union.

=== Oil company, Libya deals, and return to Soviet negotiation ===
After returning to the US, Hammer entered into a diverse array of business, art, cultural, and humanitarian endeavors, including investing in various U.S. oil-production efforts.

He gained enormous wealth through his United Distillers of America, which was a 1933 established firm known as the A. Hammer Cooperage Corporation until 1946, when it changed its name to United Distillers of America Ltd. In early 1944, Hammer purchased American Distilling Co. and a former New Market, New Hampshire, rum distillery at which his American Distilling employee, Dr. Hanns G. Maister, began producing the first United States-made potato-based spirit, which was a vodka, and also produced a blended whiskey that was retailed through the cooperage&#x27;s account with West Shore. After a B-25 plane crashed into the north face of the 79th floor of the Empire State Building on a foggy Saturday July 28 in 1945, Hammer purchased the damaged 78th floor, refurbished it, and made it the headquarters of his United Distillers of America.

His oil investments were later parlayed into control of Occidental Petroleum (Oxy) which he obtained in 1956. Through his Occidental Petroleum and its stakes in Libya, Hammer was pivotal in breaking the tight grip that the major United States domestic producers had on the price of oil, and instead gave OPEC control over oil prices. Arthur Andersen was Oxy&#x27;s auditor. &quot;National Geographic&quot; described Occidental chairman Hammer as &quot;a pioneer in the synfuels boom.&quot;

In 1973, Libya nationalized 51% of Oxy&#x27;s holdings in Libya. In 1974, Armand Hammer announced a 35-year oil exploration agreement with Libya, the first such agreement signed by Libya after Muammar Gaddafi came to power in September 1969. By the 1974 deal, 81% of the oil extracted by Occidental Petroleum was going to the Libyan government, with only 19% retained by Occidental Petroleum. At the time, Oxy was the second largest producer of oil in Libya, and Libya was the company&#x27;s only major source of crude. The Libyan government continually threatened the assets of the company, who would usually give in to Gaddafi&#x27;s demands.

Throughout his life Hammer continued personal and business dealings with the Soviet Union, despite the Cold War. In later years, he lobbied and traveled extensively at a great personal expense, working for peace between the United States and the Communist countries of the world, including ferrying physicians and supplies into the Soviet Union to help Chernobyl survivors. In his book &quot;The Prize&quot;, Daniel Yergin writes that Hammer &quot;ended up as a go-between for five Soviet General Secretaries and seven U.S. Presidents.&quot;

===Détente===

Through Hammer&#x27;s closeness to Yuri Andropov, Andropov assigned Mikhail Ilyich Bruk (; 1923 Moscow – 2009 Jurmala) also called Mike or Michael Brook or Brooke, who was an English-Russian translator, as Hammer&#x27;s personal ambassador and expediter and was present as Hammer&#x27;s translator at all meetings between Armand Hammer and Soviet leaders in the Soviet Union beginning in 1964. Bruk had been a technical translator at the first Pugwash conference called the Thinkers&#x27; Lodge held in July 1957. According to Armand Hammer, &quot;Mike&#x27;s KGB.&quot;

In early 1969, Armand Hammer obtained control of Eaton&#x27;s Tower International through which Hammer would have a controlling majority stake in Tower International in exchange for Hammer&#x27;s Occidental Petroleum assuming the debts of Tower International and Eaton receiving 45% of any profits from Tower International&#x27;s future projects.

During Soviet times Armand Hammer also financed the , which opened in 1979 and became known as the Hammer Center.

==== Trade deals between Nixon and Brezhnev ====
After Richard Nixon, as the first United States President to visit the Soviet Union, traveled to Moscow for a summit that ended on June 1, 1972, Hammer traveled to Moscow arriving July 14, 1972, and, with Sargent Shriver as his legal advisor, negotiated the first trade agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union following Nixon&#x27;s summit. Six weeks prior to Nixon&#x27;s departure, Hammer personally gave Maurice Stans, the finance chairman of Nixon&#x27;s campaign fund, $46,000 in cash from a numbered bank account in Switzerland which Hammer used as his slush fund money. Later, in September 1972 Hammer gave Nixon&#x27;s campaign fund an additional $54,000 from the same Swiss bank account amounting to a total of $100,000 that Hammer donated to Nixon&#x27;s campaign fund. On July 18, 1972, Hammer returned to the United States through London and called Tim Babcock, Hammer&#x27;s lobbyist for the Nixon administration, to have him arrange a meeting with Nixon through H. R. Haldeman, who was Nixon&#x27;s chief of staff, in order to debrief the President about Hammer&#x27;s trade deal which occurred on July 20, 1972.

During détente in July 1972, Armand Hammer negotiated a twenty year agreement through Leonid Kostandov, who was a close friend of Hammer and was the Minister of the Chemical Industry in the USSR from October 1965 to 1980, with Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet Union that was signed by Hammer in April 1973 in which the Hammer-controlled firms Occidental Petroleum and Tower International would export to the Soviet Union, and later Russia, phosphate, which Occidental mined in northern Florida, in return for the Soviet Union, and later Russia, exporting from Odessa through Hammer&#x27;s firms natural gas that would be converted into ammonia, potash, and urea. This fertilizer deal was to continue until Hammer&#x27;s 100th birthday in 1998. JaxPort at the Port of Jacksonville in Jacksonville, Florida, was the United States port through which this trade occurred. Nixon encouraged the Export–Import Bank to finance in part the deal, valued at $20 billion over 20 years, and fund the Soviet construction of four ammonia plants in the greater Volga region, and a pipeline connecting them to the port at Odessa.

On July 27, 1978, the fertilizer deal began functioning in the Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union, with the opening of the port and the Odessa plants near the former location of Grigorievka (, ) at the seaport &quot;Pivdenny&quot; (, ), which is the deepest port in Ukraine servicing vessels with drafts up to . Pivdenny is located at the Small Adzhalyk Estuary west of the 1974 established Yuzhne. The Port of Pivdenny was known as &quot;Grigorievsky&quot; () until 1978 and as the Port of Yuzhne from 1978 until April 17, 2019, when the port was renamed from the Russian word to the Ukrainian word for &quot;southern&quot;.

===Illegal financial support of Nixon&#x27;s Watergate fund===
Politically, Hammer was a Democrat; but according to the memoir of his lawyer Louis Nizer, he was also one of &quot;many executives who contribute to both political parties [and] preferred no publicity about his dual gifts.&quot; In 1972, &quot;under pressure&quot; from various sources, Hammer donated an unusual amount to Nixon&#x27;s second campaign: &quot;He wished his substantial contribution to Nixon to be anonymous because he himself was a Democrat.&quot; Hammer anonymously gave $46,000 to support Nixon before a 1971 law took effect on April 7, 1972, which banned political contributions both anonymous and through another person. Later, in September 1972, Armand Hammer made an additional three illegal contributions totaling $54,000 to Richard Nixon&#x27;s Watergate fund through friends of former Montana Governor Tim Babcock, who was Hammer&#x27;s vice president of Occidental Petroleum, after which both Hammer and Babcock pleaded guilty to charges involving illegal contributions. Hammer received probation and a $3,000 fine. In August 1989, US President George H. W. Bush pardoned Hammer for the illegal contributions to aid Nixon&#x27;s re-election in 1972.

===Association with the Gore family===
A 2003 interview with Aleksey Mitrofanov erroneously places the Hammer and Gore families close to each other in Europe. Occidental&#x27;s coal interests were represented for many years by attorney and former U.S. Senator Al Gore Sr., among others. Gore, who had a longtime close friendship with Hammer, became the head of the subsidiary Island Creek Coal Company, upon his election loss in the Senate in November 1970. Much of Occidental&#x27;s coal and phosphate production was in Tennessee, the state Gore represented in the Senate, and Gore owned shares in the company. Former Vice President Al Gore Jr. received much criticism from environmentalists, when the shares passed to the estate after the death of Gore Sr., and Gore Jr. was a son and the executor of the estate. Gore Jr. did not exercise control over the shares, which were eventually sold when the estate closed.

Hammer was very fond of Gore Jr. and, in 1984, under Hammer&#x27;s guidance, Gore Jr. sought Tennessee&#x27;s Senate office previously held by Howard Baker. Hammer supposedly promised Gore Sr. that he could make his son the president of the United States. It was under Hammer&#x27;s encouragement and support that Gore Jr. sought the Democratic Party presidential nomination in 1988.

===Stake in Arm &amp; Hammer===
In the 1980s Hammer owned a considerable amount of stock in Church &amp; Dwight, the company that manufactures Arm &amp; Hammer products; he also served on its board of directors. However, the Arm &amp; Hammer company&#x27;s brand name did not originate with Armand Hammer. It was in use 31 years before Hammer was born. While Hammer and Occidental said that the Church &amp; Dwight investment was a coincidence, Hammer acknowledged previously trying to buy the Arm &amp; Hammer brand as a result of often being asked about it.

=== President&#x27;s Cancer Panel ===
In 1981, Hammer was appointed by US President Ronald Reagan to serve on the three-member President&#x27;s Cancer Panel and he later served as chairman of the panel from 1984 to 1989. As chairman of the panel, he announced a campaign to raise $1 billion a year to fight cancer.

==Other activities and pursuits==
Hammer was a philanthropist, supporting causes related to education, medicine, and the arts. He was a collector of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings. His personal donation forms the core of the permanent collection of the UCLA Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, California. Together with his brother Victor, he was the owner of the &quot;Hammer Galleries&quot; in New York City. Hammer purchased Knoedler, the oldest art gallery in America, in 1971. Hammer hired art historian John Richardson as director at Knoedler; Richardson later wrote an unflattering portrait of him, nailing Hammer with the tag &quot;a veteran con man&quot;.
Among his legacies is the Armand Hammer United World College of the American West (now generally called the UWC-USA, part of the United World Colleges), which he helped found in 1981, with the support of the then-Prince of Wales, Charles, who was president of United World Colleges International. Due to his closeness to the future Charles III, he was figuratively called a godfather to one of the Prince&#x27;s children. It has been reported that Charles intended to make Hammer Prince William&#x27;s godfather but was forced to abandon these plans as Princess Diana disliked the idea. In the 1980s, Hammer gave strong financial support to Prince Charles&#x27;s projects of nearly 40 million pounds and free use of Hammer&#x27;s Boeing 727.

Together with his friends Harry and Rosa Strygler, he also supported several Jewish foundations, particularly those associated with the Holocaust. Hammer hungered for a Nobel Peace Prize, and he was repeatedly nominated for one, including by Menachem Begin, but never won.

In 1986, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine estimated his net worth at $200 million.

Hammer made a guest appearance on a 1988 episode of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; (as the grandfather of a friend of Theo Huxtable&#x27;s who was suffering from cancer), saying that a cure for cancer was imminent.

Hammer was leading Occidental in 1988 when its oil rig, Piper Alpha, exploded, killing 167 men. The Cullen Report highlighted failings in many areas on the platform.

As of 2016, he has been the subject of six biographies: in 1975 (Considine, authorized biography), 1985 (Bryson, coffee table book), Weinberg 1989, Blumay 1992, Epstein 1996, and Alef 2009; and two autobiographies (1932 and a bestseller in 1987). His art collection, &quot;The Armand Hammer Collection: Four Centuries of Masterpieces&quot;, published by the Armand Hammer Foundation in multiple editions, eventually became &quot;five&quot; centuries of masterpieces, sometimes in conjunction with museums where the collection was displayed. and his philanthropic projects were the subject of numerous publications.

==Awards==
In 1978, Hammer, as a non-citizen of the Soviet Union, received the Soviet Union&#x27;s award the Order of Friendship of Peoples from Leonid Brezhnev because of his strong support of both the International Workers and Communist movement and the needs of the Soviet Union. By the time of his death, Hammer had received other awards, including:
* Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (1978) 

* US: National Medal of Arts (1987)

== Personal life ==

Hammer was the middle of three sons. He had close relationships, including in business, with his brothers, Harry and Victor Hammer, throughout their lives.

Hammer married three times. In 1927, Hammer married a Russian actress, Olga Vadimovna von Root, who was the daughter of a czarist general. In 1943, he married Angela Zevely. In 1956, he married the wealthy widow Frances Barrett, and they remained married until her death in 1989.

Hammer had one son, Julian Armand Hammer, by his first wife. Hammer&#x27;s grandson is businessman Michael Armand Hammer; his great-grandson is actor Armie Hammer.

Hammer died of bone marrow cancer in December 1990, aged 92 in Los Angeles. He is buried in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery, across the street from the Occidental Petroleum headquarters on Wilshire Boulevard.

<doc id="263456" wikidata="Q677300" url="?curid=263456" title="San Pedro Town">
<text>San Pedro is a town on the southern part of the island of Ambergris Caye in the Belize District of the nation of Belize, in Central America. According to the 2024 mid-year estimates, the town has a population of about 20,000. It is the second-largest town in the Belize District and largest in the Belize Rural South constituency. The once sleepy fishing village was granted the status of a town in 1984.

San Pedro&#x27;s inhabitants are known as San Pedranos and most of them originally came from Mexico. Most speak both Spanish and English fluently. Due to the influence of English-based Kriol, most San Pedranos can speak English, as well as an intermediate form between English and Spanish that is known as &quot;Kitchen Spanish&quot;. It is said one is not a true San Pedrano if one doesn&#x27;t know how to fish.

In Madonna&#x27;s early 2000&#x27;s interview with the New York Times, she stated that the inspiration for the name of San Pedro in her song &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; was likely her reading of an exit ramp on the way to the music studio. She wasn&#x27;t a traveler then and had no knowledge of San Pedro. The town is said to be the inspiration for the song &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; (which begins with the line &quot;last night I dreamt of San Pedro&quot;), written by Madonna, Patrick Leonard and Bruce Gaitsch. Manuel Heredia, minister of tourism in Belize commented Madonna&#x27;s musical theme has helped to attract tourists to land.

==History==
The refugees from the &quot;Guerra de Castas&quot; fled mainly south to the sanctuary of northern Belize where the British authorities gave them protection and encouraged them to settle. This was done in the hope that the refugees would eventually establish an agricultural settlement in Corozal and provide the lumber camps with an alternative source of foodstuffs now that the supplies through Bacalar in Mexico were no longer available.

This migration was the principal factor in the settling of northern Belize. The population grew from less than 200 in 1846 to 4,500 inhabitants by 1857, to 8,000 in 1858, in the Corozal District alone. According to the official census in 1861, the population of the northern section of the country was almost twice that of Belize City and the surrounding areas.

The first permanent settlers of San Pedro arrived between 1848 and 1849. These probably consisted of the relatives of fishermen who had previously built fishing camps on the cayes and moved their families over to the safety of the island when the Santa Cruz Maya revolted. There were at first only four families, which were shortly joined by others from the nearby area of Bacalar. The settlement soon grew to a village of about 30 houses and over 50 inhabitants. The settling of Ambergris Caye was typical of this general pattern. The refugees who came to live here had been farmers and fishers in Yucatán who continued these activities in San Pedro.

On November 27, 1984, San Pedro was officially granted township status. The declaration ceremony was attended by Governor-General Elmira Minita Gordon, Area Representative Louis Sylvestre, and most of the residents of San Pedro. Gilberto Chico Gomez was the town&#x27;s first mayor.

==Tourism==
Over the centuries, San Pedro has become one of the most popular tourist destinations with protected areas such as Hol Chan Marine Reserve, Shark Ray Alley, Bacalarchico, and many more. One of San Pedro&#x27;s most prized possessions is the Belize Barrier Reef. The San Pedro Barrier Reef is the &#x27;second-largest&#x27; in the world, the first being the Great Barrier Reef. It is home to a diverse number of species.

One of the primary industries in the town is tourism, most notably scuba diving. So many visitors are divers that there are two hyperbaric decompression chambers on the island.

Ambergris Museum is in the town. The north road is over 10 miles long and has greatly expanded resort and beach house development with better access than only watercraft.

==Carnaval festival==

Today San Pedro is known for festivals, one of the most famous being El Gran Carnaval de San Pedro.

El Gran Carnaval de San Pedro goes back to the 1870s, a tradition that is centered around “Juan Carnaval”. A legend states “Juan was an island god, that had sex with over a thousand women from eight different countries and had many children.&quot; It is said that he was stabbed to death by his hurt and jealous wife — leaving behind nothing but a will that is traditionally read on Ash Wednesday. A stuffed doll-like idol of Juan Carnaval is burnt every year as a symbol of cleansing the community&#x27;s sins.

This tradition started out with the use of powder and has now expanded into water paint and the breaking of eggs. There are rules to this festival: The first day is restricted to children until 7 pm, from Ruby&#x27;s Hotel beachfront to the cemetery area and the Barrier Reef Drive. They are not allowed to paint individuals who are not participating nor public signs, buildings, and the Comparsa participants. Lastly, they are not allowed to use rotten eggs, spray paint, or oil paints.

<doc id="263460" wikidata="Q212826" url="?curid=263460" title="West Bromwich">
<text>West Bromwich ( ), commonly known as West Brom, is a market town in the borough of Sandwell, in the county of the West Midlands, England. Historically part of Staffordshire, it is northwest of Birmingham. West Bromwich is part of the area known as the Black Country, in terms of geography, cultures and dialect. West Bromwich had a population of 103,112 in the 2021 Census.

Initially a rural village, West Bromwich&#x27;s growth corresponded with that of the Industrial Revolution, owing to the area&#x27;s natural richness in ironstone and coal, as well as its proximity to canals and railway branches. It led to the town becoming a centre for coal mining, brick making, the iron industry and metal trades such as nails, springs and guns. The town&#x27;s primary economy developed into the engineering, manufacturing and the automotive industry through the early 20th century. During the Second World War, West Bromwich experienced bombing from the German Luftwaffe. It also suffered heavily during recessions in the mid 1970s, early 1980s and late 2000s.

The town is known for its football club West Bromwich Albion, who have played in the town since the club&#x27;s formation in 1878. It is also home to parts of Sandwell Valley Country Park and Sandwell Valley RSPB nature reserve.

==History==

===Origin and etymology===
West Bromwich was first mentioned as &quot;Bromwic&quot; (&#x27;broom village&#x27;) in the Domesday Book of 1086. It is believed that it may have originally been part of the Handsworth parish. A Benedictine priory existed in West Bromwich from the 12th century around which the settlement of &quot;Broomwich Heath&quot; grew. In 1727, the town became a stop on the coaching road between London and Shrewsbury and the beginning of its growth dates from this time. The prefix &#x27;West&#x27; serves to distinguish it from the village of Castle Bromwich, around to the east on the other side of Birmingham.

===Development===
In the 19th century, coal deposits were discovered, ensuring that the town grew rapidly as an industrial centre, with industries such as spring, gun and nail making developing. Well before the end of the 19th century, West Bromwich had established itself as a prominent area to match older neighbouring towns including Dudley and Walsall.

In 1888, West Bromwich became a county borough, incorporating the village of Great Barr. It was expanded in 1966, acquiring most of the boroughs of Tipton and Wednesbury as well as a small section of Coseley urban district, before joining with the neighbouring county borough of Warley (which contained the towns of Rowley Regis, Oldbury and Smethwick) in 1974 to form the Metropolitan Borough of Sandwell.

Charlemont Hall, built during the 1750s, stood on the west side of the present Charlemont Crescent, in the Charlemont and Grove Vale district of the town. Charlemont Hall was described as &quot;a lofty neat-looking house of brick, faced with stone, with iron palisades etc. in front.&quot; An east wing was added in 1855. The last occupant was the widow of Thomas Jones, town clerk of Wednesbury 1897–1921. The house was demolished in 1948, and is now covered by a number of smaller detached homes. Much of the surrounding area was developed during the 1960s as the Charlemont Farm housing estate, which is a mix of private and council housing.

The population of West Bromwich suffered heavily in the Cholera epidemic of 1831 which spread northwards into the town. A temporary board of health was set up and a hospital opened in the former Revivalist chapel in Spon Lane. The natural gradual slope of the land provided drainage within the soil, however, urbanisation made this increasingly difficult and drainage along the streets was described as inadequate. The West Bromwich Town Improvement Commissioners was established in 1854, and they tackled the drainage problem in the town. They appointed members to new titles and in the 1880s bought land in Friar Park for a sewerage farm.

Under the Reform Act 1832, West Bromwich became part of the new southern division of Staffordshire, and under the Reform Act 1867 it was transferred to the parliamentary borough of Wednesbury. Under the Redistribution of Seats Act of 1885, the borough of West Bromwich became a parliamentary borough returning one member. In 1885, it was held by the Liberal Party but from 1886 to 1906 it was held by the Conservative Party before being held by the Liberal Party again until 1910 when the Conservative Party regained the area which they held until 1918 under the representation of Viscount Lewisham. In 1918, it was won by Labour who held it until 2019, when Nicola Richards was elected as MP. Prior to that the constituency was held by Labour except for the period between 1931 and 1935 when it held by the National Unionists.

===20th century===
By the outbreak of World War I in 1914, many of the older houses built to house workers during the Industrial Revolution were becoming unfit for human habitation. Sanitation was inadequate, decay was rife, and the homes were becoming a danger to the health and safety of their inhabitants. After the end of the war, the local council started building new homes to rehouse people from the rundown town centre. However, there are still many late 19th century and early 20th century buildings around the centre of West Bromwich.

The first council housing in West Bromwich was built in 1920 on the Tantany Estate to the north of the town centre. Within 20 years, several thousand council houses had been built by West Bromwich County Borough Council. The largest developments were mostly in the north of the town, including the Charlemont Farm Estate around Walsall Road, and the Friar Park Estate near the border with Wednesbury.


The town suffered significant damage from air raids in World War II, with 58 civilian deaths, most in the raids of 19 November 1940 around Oak Road and Lombard Street to the west of the town centre. There were a few other less severe raids during the war on parts of West Bromwich including Stone Cross and Tantany, with no fatalities. This occurred on the same night as the Birmingham Blitz, which resulted in thousands of casualties, as well as the less severe raids on nearby Dudley and Tipton.

The first major postwar council housing development was the Harvills Hawthorn Estate near Hill Top, which was completed in 1948.

Mass immigration from the Commonwealth took place in West Bromwich during the 1950s and 1960s, with most of these hailing from the Indian subcontinent, although a significant number of Afro-Caribbean immigrants also settled in West Bromwich. The majority of these immigrants settled in the older parts of the town that were mostly made up of Victorian and Edwardian terraced houses.

The local road network was also greatly increased during the 1960s and 1970s. West Bromwich is at the extreme northern end of the M5 motorway, with junction 1 serving the town on the A41 road. Traffic passing through West Bromwich on the main route from Wolverhampton to Birmingham was soon diverted along the new dual carriageway, the &quot;Northern Loop Road&quot; (also known as &quot;The Expressway&quot;), after its opening in 1972, with another dual carriageway being built to link The Expressway with neighbouring Oldbury.

West Bromwich County Borough was expanded in 1966 to include the bulk of Tipton and Wednesbury, while a small part of the south-eastern section of the town was absorbed into the new Warley County Borough which was centred on neighbouring Oldbury, Smethwick and Rowley Regis. The actual town boundaries of West Bromwich were also altered at this time, placing the Friar Park estate in Wednesbury, while the Hateley Heath area of Wednesbury was now within the borders of West Bromwich township.

As with many other parts of the Midlands, West Bromwich was hit badly by the recessions of the mid-1970s and early 1980s, resulting in mass unemployment across the town, exceeding 20% in some districts.

Queen&#x27;s Square shopping centre opened in the town centre in 1971, providing shoppers with a 60-unit indoor shopping centre and an 850-space multi-storey car park. It cost £3million to build. The smaller King&#x27;s Square shopping centre also opened in the town in 1971. On 8 December 2011, 40 years after the opening of Queen&#x27;s Square, Sandwell Council announced that Queen&#x27;s Square would be refurbished at a cost of £5million. By this stage, the centre was falling into disrepair and only 33 of the 61 available units were occupied. Once again, West Bromwich had been hit hard by another recession, with local unemployment running high again, as well as a high vacancy rate for commercial and industrial units.

Many local towns, particularly Dudley, lost many of their major stores around the time that the Merry Hill Shopping Centre which was developed at Brierley Hill during the second half of the 1980s as businesses looked to take advantage of the Enterprise Zone incentives that the centre offered. West Bromwich&#x27;s fortunes as a retail centre were seriously affected by the Merry Hill development. This contributed to the closure of its Marks and Spencer store on 25 August 1990, along with the Dudley store, to be replaced by a new store at Merry Hill, with most of the staff at the new store being transferred from either West Bromwich or Dudley. British Home Stores also pulled out of the town around the same time, and a new store at Merry Hill which opened in November 1989 also spelled the end of the Dudley store. 

The town lost another big retail name in 2005 when the Littlewoods store closed as part of the retailer&#x27;s decision to switch wholly to online shopping; the unit has since been taken over by New Look. Retail developments around Oldbury, beginning with the SavaCentre hypermarket in 1980, have also affected trade in West Bromwich. The recession beginning in 2008 has pushed the town centre further into decline, a notable casualty being the Woolworths store which closed on 30 December 2008 as a result of the retailer going into liquidation; the building was not re-occupied until Home Bargains took it over in 2012.

Several more factories have closed in more recent years as manufacturers look to countries where the labour is cheaper, but West Bromwich remains a relatively busy industrial area despite the decline of the last 35 years.

West Bromwich&#x27;s road links were further enhanced in 1995 on the completion of the Black Country Spine Road which also by-passes Wednesbury and the east of Bilston. The completion of this new road opened up several square miles of previously inaccessible land, and has allowed several major businesses to set up along the route. This has helped relieve some of the unemployment problems in West Bromwich, although most parts of the town still have the highest unemployment rates in the West Midlands.

===21st century===
West Bromwich was among the many towns and cities in England affected by the widespread rioting in August 2011. On 9 August, shops closed their doors early to combat looting and vandalism; this was followed by widespread acts of vandalism and violence followed. Police closed the main roads leading into the town until the following morning.

The town has enjoyed something of an economic revival since July 2013, when, after a large scale demolition of an area including the school known as Cronehills, the New Square shopping and entertainment complex opened in the town centre on land adjoining the existing Queen&#x27;s Square shopping centre. Hundreds of jobs have been created and the town has attracted retailers including Next, JD Sports, Primark and Bank Fashion, as well as an Odeon cinema, several food and drink outlets, and a Tesco Extra superstore.

The mixed success of West Bromwich Albion F.C. has also had a significant impact on the town&#x27;s economy, particularly during the club&#x27;s successful era of the 1960s and 1970s when it frequently competed in the top division of English football, won the FA Cup and qualified for European competitions on several occasions. Attendances were high during this era, but slumped during the 1980s when the club&#x27;s on-the-field fortunes began to decline and culminated in relegation in 1986, at a time which the local economy had already suffered a sharp decline. Albion did not play in the top flight again until 2002, and remained a regular presence in the FA Premier League until 2018, during which time the club attracted a level of average attendance not seen since the late 1970s.

The archives for West Bromwich Borough are held at Sandwell Community History and Archives Service.

==Governance==
The town is divided into two constituencies: Tipton and Wednesbury and West Bromwich.

West Bromwich is served by Sarah Coombes (Labour Party), who was elected on 4 July 2024

Tipton and Wednesbury is served by Antonia Bance (Labour Party), who was elected on 4 July 2024. Betty Boothroyd had previously served as the constituency&#x27;s MP and she was the 
first female Speaker of the House of Commons.

== Demography ==
At the 2021 census, West Bromwich&#x27;s built-up area population was recorded as having a population of 103,112. Of the findings, the ethnicity and religious composition of the wards separately were:

The religious composition of the built-up area at the 2021 Census was recorded as:

===Climate===
The climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot;. (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).
==Features==

The town&#x27;s football club is West Bromwich Albion. The club was founded in 1878 and in 1888 it became one of the 12 founder members of the Football League. It won the league championship in 1920 and has won the FA Cup five times, most recently in 1968, and won the League Cup in 1966. Albion were based in and around the centre of West Bromwich during their formative years, but moved further out of the town in 1900 when they switched to their current ground, The Hawthorns. All traces of the original structures are long gone; the present structures were added to the stadium in 1979, 1994 and most recently 2001. At an altitude of 551 feet, The Hawthorns is the highest football ground (above sea level) in the country.

Engineering and chemicals are important to the town&#x27;s economy, as it played a crucial part in the Industrial Revolution during the 19th century and still retains many manufacturing jobs to this day, despite a steady nationwide decline in this sector since the 1970s.

Sandwell General Hospital (on the site of the former Hallam Hospital) is located near the town centre. It is currently part of the Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, one of the largest NHS teaching trusts in the United Kingdom.

William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth had his seat at Sandwell Hall. Legge was unusual as an aristocrat of this period by being a Methodist and attending the Wednesbury Methodist meetings, where fellow Methodists – many of them colliers and drovers – knew him as &quot;Brother Earl&quot;.

West Bromwich Town Hall, situated in the centre of the High Street, is a Grade II listed building. It was built between 1874 and 1875 in brick and stone to an Italian Gothic design, and its interior reflects the Victorian interest in Gothic and Medieval architecture. Its Grand Organ, built in 1862, is considered to be of historic importance for its musical and technical qualities.

West Bromwich Manor House, Hall Green Road, was built by the de Marnham family in the late 13th century as the centre of their agricultural estate in West Bromwich only the Great Hall survives of the original complex of living quarters, agricultural barns, sheds and ponds. Successive occupants modernised and extended the Manor House until it was described in 1790 as &quot;a large pile of irregular half-timbered buildings, black and white, and surrounded with numerous out-houses and lofty walls.&quot; The Manor House was saved from demolition in the 1950s by West Bromwich Corporation which carried out an extensive and sympathetic restoration of this nationally important building.

The Oak House is an historic building in the Greets Green area. Its exact date of origin is uncertain, but in 1634 it was owned by the Turtons. John Wesley preached there twice in the late 1700s. Reuben Farley gave it to the town as a museum, with the formal opening on 25 July 1898. In 1949 it was protected as a Grade II* Listed Building.

In August 2009, The Public arts centre designed by architect Will Alsop fully opened. By 2013, the venue was attracting nearly 400,000 visitors a year and was bringing leading national and international artists to the town. Originally beset by problems before opening, in May 2013, it was revealed that Sandwell Council were considering borrowing a substantial amount of money to repurpose the £70 million building and lease it to Sandwell College to provide a new sixth form centre to complement the recently opened Central Campus in the town.

A large portion of the town centre was procured by Tesco for the development of a Tesco Extra store and shopping centre called New Square, West Bromwich which has been built on top of the old hospital. In the early 2000s the tenants of homes and businesses have slowly moved out of the site to make way for the development. Cronehills Primary School (staff and pupils) relocated to the newly built Eaton Valley Primary School, which opened in September 2009. The police station relocated to a brand new building the other site of the ring road. Major works started on the site during October 2011 and the development was completed by late spring 2013.

Dartmouth Park, opened in 1878 by William Legge, 5th Earl of Dartmouth, lies to the east of the town. Beyond Dartmouth Park is Sandwell Valley, which contains Sandwell Valley Country Park and Sandwell Valley RSPB nature reserve. The 660 acre country park is located on the River Tame, in the middle of the urban conurbation between Birmingham and West Bromwich. The RSPB nature reserve is adjacent, and attracts over 150 different bird species. There are also two farms on the site that are open to the public: Sandwell Park Farm and Forge Mill Farm.

==Religion==
West Bromwich is a culturally diverse area with many places of worship for several different religions.

At the time of writing (2023), The Church of England provides the most places of worship across the geographically wider West Bromwich Deanery (taking in West Bromwich, Hill Top, Stone Cross, Carter&#x27;s Green, Holy Trinity, All Saints, St Andrew&#x27;s, St Francis, Friar Park and others) which contains nine Anglican churches. Other Christian denominations are present, including Roman Catholic, Seventh-day Adventist, Methodist, Baptist, Elim Pentecostal, Assemblies of God and other independent churches. The deanery of West Bromwich is under the Anglican Diocese of Lichfield.

West Bromwich has four mosques. With two on Dartmouth street, one serving the Bangladeshi sunni community and the other, the Pakistani sunni community. The reason for the separate mosques is due to historic differences in opinions between imams of the berelvi community (Pakistani) and other sunni denominations. The largest mosque in West Bromwich is the Madinatul Uloon Al-Islamiyah Madrasa on Moor street which accommodates all Muslim Sunni denominations and follows the Deobandi school of thought. The fourth mosque opened in 2016 and follows the Bangladeshi fultoli teachings.

The Bangladeshi mosque on Dartmouth street (the Jami Masjid and Islamic Centre) is currently fundraising to rebuild a purpose-built mosque to accommodate more worshippers. Currently, they have obtained the land they require for this rebuild but are lacking crucial funding required for the ambitious multi-million pound rebuild. The Jami Masjid and Islamic Centre was the first mosque in the area, of Bangladeshi origin. Madinatul Uloom Al-Islamiyah, located at Moor street is based at an abandoned church and was converted into a functioning mosque in 2001. The mosque also functions as a madrasa, meaning that it offers taught classes and hosts Islamic events including an annual jalsa (Islamic gathering). It currently (and since 2003) offers Islamic evening classes to hundreds of children and has plans in the future to offer higher education to adults who desire to pursue Islamic studies at a higher level. The premises consists of two large prayer halls and an assortment of classrooms. This mosque is regularly attended by mostly people of Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Arab ethnicity (in order of proportions of worshippers from each ethnicity) – but what sets this mosque apart from others in West Bromwich, is that it is used regularly by people of many ethnicities, unlike other mosques in West Bromwich which are primarily used by people of one ethnicity.

There are also a large number of Sikhs in the area. There are many Gurudwaras. Sikhs have settled in the area since 1950, when the first influx of immigrants came. The oldest Gurdwara in West Bromwich is the Gurdwara Guru Har Rai Sahib Ji on High Street. Other Gurdwara&#x27;s include Guru Nanak Gurdwara on Edward Street and Gurdwara Sachkhand Ishar Darbar on Vicarage Road.

Hindus have had a formal place of worship in West Bromwich since the opening of the Shree Krishna Mandir in 1974, in a converted church once called Ebenezer Congregational Chapel, which had closed in 1971. It was damaged by fire on 8 December 1992, the same date that a Mandir in Birmingham and another in Coventry were damaged in arson attacks. It was believed to have been connected to religious violence in India that was spreading into communities in Britain.

In 1875, being locked out of a packed Evangelist meeting in Birmingham caused John Blackham of Ebenezer Congregational Church to start the Pleasant Sunday Afternoon Movement.

==Transport==

===Railway===
West Bromwich railway station was opened by the Great Western Railway on its route between Birmingham Snow Hill and Wolverhampton Low Level on 14 November 1854. The trackbed of that line is now served by the West Midlands Metro light rail (tram) system with West Bromwich having seven tram stops: The Hawthorns, Kenrick Park, Trinity Way, West Bromwich Central, Lodge Road West Bromwich Town Hall, Dartmouth Street and Dudley Street Guns Village. The nearest main-line railway station is now Sandwell &amp; Dudley railway station, approximately away in Oldbury town centre. Though services to Stourbridge Junction, Worcester Shrub Hill, Worcester Foregate Street, Birmingham Snow Hill and Birmingham Moor Street call at The Hawthorns railway station. There was previously a railway station on Newton Road, which was located a mile away from the town centre; it was on the Grand Junction Railway that ran from Birmingham New Street to Stafford via Wolverhampton High Level and Walsall. This station closed in 1945 and, although it moved twice between 1863 and 1902, only the line remains in use for the services from Walsall to Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Liverpool Lime Street.

===Roads===
The M5 motorway between the West Midlands and the West Country and its junction with the M6 motorway passes through the town, making West Bromwich at the hub of Britain&#x27;s motorway network. Improvements were made at the A41 junction by West Bromwich town centre after a £25 million project grant was awarded to the area to cut congestion for commuters. The junction, which is where The Expressway meets All Saints Way (A4031), currently carries over 60,000 vehicles a day and is close to junction 1 of the M5. The project involved the creation of a dual carriageway underpass beneath an improved roundabout; this work began in June 2010 and was completed in autumn 2012.

Carters Green, High Street and the beginning of Birmingham Road formed the original main route through West Bromwich as part of Thomas Telford&#x27;s London to Holyhead route in the early 19th century. This later formed part of the A41 road which links London with Merseyside, taking in the Midlands, Shropshire, Warwickshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire on the way. However, the route through central West Bromwich was by-passed in 1973 on the completion of the Expressway, a two-mile (3 km) dual carriageway beginning at Carters Green and finishing at junction 1 of the recently completed M5 motorway on Birmingham Road. The original A41 road through the centre of West Bromwich was downgraded to an unclassified route.

Around this time, West Bromwich Ringway was opened which circulates the main shopping areas. The section of the Ringway, near the new Tesco, has since had traffic restrictions placed on it prohibiting use by private cars.

Further revolution came to the local road network in 1995, with the completion of the Black Country Spine Road which stretches from Carters Green to Bilston via Wednesbury, forming another new section of the A41.

===Buses===
West Bromwich has a large bus station managed by Transport for West Midlands and served by a large number of routes, both locally to places such as Oldbury, Smethwick and Stone Cross as well as regional bus routes to places such as Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Walsall. Stands are lettered A to Z. The main bus operators serving the bus station are National Express West Midlands and Diamond West Midlands.

===Air===
The nearest airport, which is approximately away, is Birmingham Airport, which can be reached by tram to Birmingham New Street and train to Birmingham International.

==Education==
The largest educational provider in the town is the Central Campus of Sandwell College. This is housed in a £77 million building opened in February 2012. The college is capable of enrolling over 5,000 students each year across many curriculum areas. Central Sixth delivers the college&#x27;s A-Level programme covering some thirty different subject areas. Facilities in the Central Campus include a Boeing 737 fuselage used for training air cabin crew and a dental surgery used to train dental nurses. Central Campus also offers a wide variety of apprenticeships and a small number of Higher Education programmes.

The town is served by five secondary schools: George Salter Academy, Health Futures UTC, the Phoenix Collegiate, Q3 Academy Great Barr and Sandwell Academy. A new secondary school, West Bromwich Collegiate Academy, opened in September 2019.

The town has 21 primary schools in total. Some of which are Lodge Primary School, St. John Bosco RC Primary School, Holy Trinity C of E Primary School, Ryders Green Primary School, All Saints&#x27; CofE Primary School, St Mary Magdalene, Hateley Heath and Eaton Valley.

Sandwell Academy serves the whole of West Bromwich (along with the rest of Sandwell), Phoenix Collegiate Academy serves the area around Hateley Heath, Tantany, Charlemont and Grove Vale and Stone Cross, West Midlands. George Salter Academy serves the west of the town near the border with Tipton. Q3 Academy serves the north-eastern part of the town around Great Barr.

The area was also served by Churchfields High School, approximately north of the town centre. Due to constant closure rumours, less and less pupils began enrolling to attend the school and it was closed in July 2001. The site has since been redeveloped for housing.


==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Sutton Coldfield TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio WM, Heart West Midlands, Capital Midlands, Smooth West Midlands, Hits Radio Birmingham and Greatest Hits Radio Birmingham &amp; The West Midlands. The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Express &amp; Star&quot; (formerly &quot;West Bromwich Chronicle&quot;).

==Sport==
===Football===
The town&#x27;s sport scene is dominated by West Bromwich Albion, a football club who were founded in the town in 1878 by workers from George Salter&#x27;s Spring Works in West Bromwich. They played at a number of sites near the town centre until they moved to their current home, The Hawthorns on Birmingham Road (on the borders of Smethwick and Handsworth) in 1900.

West Brom were among the 12 founder members of the Football League in 1888 (the first professional football league in the world), along with their two fiercest local rivals, Aston Villa and Wolverhampton Wanderers. Albion have spent the majority of their existence in the top tier of English football.

The club has won nine major trophies; five FA Cups (1888, 1892, 1931, 1954, 1968), one league title (1920), one Football League Cup (1966), and two Charity Shields (1920, 1954). The victory that came in 1968 was their most recent major trophy, when they won the FA Cup with a 1–0 win over Everton at Wembley Stadium. They enjoyed further success in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when they finished in the top five league positions three times in four seasons as well as reaching a UEFA Cup quarter-final. They currently play in the Championship, the second tier of English football, having been relegated from the Premier League in May 2021.

Notable former players of West Bromwich Albion include Ronnie Allen (who later had two spells as the club&#x27;s manager), Bryan Robson (who was also later the club&#x27;s manager), Laurie Cunningham (the first black player to play for the u-21 England national team, but died in 1989 at age 33), Tony Brown (the club&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer) and Jeff Astle (who scored the club&#x27;s winning goal in the 1968 FA Cup final and remained a cult figure among Albion fans).

===Cricket===
The local cricket team is West Bromwich Dartmouth Cricket Club, and is based in the town. The club was founded in 1834. It is a founder member of the Birmingham and District Cricket League, the oldest cricket league in the world. They play their home games at Sandwell Valley, opposite the Hawthorns.

<text>Borussia Verein für Leibesübungen 1900 e.V. Mönchengladbach, better known as Borussia Mönchengladbach () and colloquially known as just Gladbach, is a professional football club based in Mönchengladbach, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. They play in the Bundesliga, the top flight of German football. Nicknamed &quot;Die Fohlen&quot; (The Foals), the club has won five league titles, three DFB-Pokals and two UEFA Cup titles.

Borussia Mönchengladbach was founded in 1900, with its name derived from a Latinised form of Prussia, which was a popular name for German clubs in the former Kingdom of Prussia. The team joined the Bundesliga in 1965 and saw the majority of its success in the 1970s, where, under the guidance of Hennes Weisweiler and then Udo Lattek, a young squad with a fast, aggressive playing style was formed. During this period, Mönchengladbach won the Bundesliga five times, the UEFA Cup twice and reached a European Cup final in 1977.

Since 2004, Borussia Mönchengladbach have played at Borussia-Park, having previously played at the Bökelbergstadion since 1919. Based on membership, they are the fifth-largest club in Germany with over 75,000 members in 2016 and 93,000 as of 2021. The club&#x27;s main rivals are 1. FC Köln, against whom they contest the Rheinland Derby. Their secondary rivals include Borussia Dortmund, Fortuna Düsseldorf and Bayer Leverkusen.

==History==
===1899–1905: formation===
In November 1899, a group of discontented members left their sports association, TC Germania Gladbach (referred to as &quot;Teutonia Gladbach&quot; in some sources). On 17 November 1899, thirteen of these young men formed a new club, this time specifically focused on association football, in the &quot;Zum Jägerhof&quot; pub. They chose the word &quot;Borussia&quot; (Latin: &quot;Prussia&quot;) as their association&#x27;s new title, although this was not yet the club&#x27;s official founding. &quot;Borussia&quot; was chosen because Mönchengladbach was located in the western provinces awarded to the Kingdom of Prussia as part of the 1815 Congress of Vienna. Other notable football clubs in western Germany that chose the name &quot;Prussia&quot; as their title include Borussia Dortmund in 1909 and SC Preußen Münster in 1906.Borussia&#x27;s early years were faced with the problems typical for association football teams in the German Empire: the sport, only recently imported from the UK in the 1880s, was not yet institutionally accepted, and as a result there were logistical shortages of football fields, goals, changing rooms, and player equipment. Borussia&#x27;s players initially had to finance their own gear for what was at the time a considerable financial expenditure for working-class people.

Borussia was the second dedicated football club in the city of Mönchengladbach. FC Mönchengladbach, founded six years earlier in 1894, quickly became Borussia&#x27;s first rival. Whereas FC Mönchengladbach was socially and financially established, young Borussia found it difficult to guarantee regular access to training grounds and equipment. As a result, the team joined the &quot;Marianische Jünglings-Kongregation Mönchengladbach Eicken&quot; (German: &quot;Marian Youth Congregation Mönchengladbach Eicken&quot;), a conservative Catholic sporting association. Within this larger organization, the footballers reformed into the &quot;Fussball Club Borussia 1900&quot; on 1 August 1900, marking the club&#x27;s official founding date.

From within the congregation, Borussia was able to more effectively organize official games against various opposing teams. The team scored 2–1 victories over both Blitz Neuwerk and Germania Mönchengladbach, and a 4–2 victory over Rheydt FC. As early as 1902, Borussia crossed international borders for the first time, losing 0–2 against Helmondia Helmond in the Netherlands, before playing the Dutch team to a 1–1 draw at home.

The appeal of both association football in general and Borussia in particular caused tensions with the conservative ideology of the Youth Congregation; the practice of football players wearing shorts instead of long trousers and the reality of football practice on Sundays hindering Church attendance created tension between Borussia and the Youth Congregation Eicken, and Borussia ultimately left the congregation on 24 May 1903.

To continue successful football competitions and to ease the organization of games, the club had applied to join the &quot;Rheinisch-Westfälischer Spielverband&quot; (German: &quot;Rhenish-Westphalian Sports Federation&quot;) on 16 February 1903, and was accepted on 23 February. Borussia continued playing local and regional opponents like Britannia Düsseldorf and BV Solingen. They also continued to travel to the nearby Netherlands, drawing Eindhoven VV 1–1. Borussia received a 0–11 defeat against Borussia Cologne in October 1903 in the away fixture; the loss was repeated 1–4 at home in the return game.

In 1904, Borussia competed with several other local teams in the third class of the second district of the Rhenish-Westphalian Sports Federation. After Borussia&#x27;s only competitor for the title, BV Solingen, skipped the 1905 fixture in Mönchengladbach, Borussia won the title without having to face their opponent. On 8 January 1905, Borussia additionally scored a respectable 1–0 win over its city rival FC Mönchengladbach, albeit against the third team, confirming an earlier 6–1 win over FC Mönchengladbach on 26 December 1904. After having won the district cup, Borussia competed for the third class federation cup against, among others, teams from Essen and Cologne, ultimately losing the title to Kölner FC 99.

===1905–1914: before the First World War===
After some decent athletic success in the year 1905 (18 games, 12 wins, 1 draw, 5 losses), Borussia nonetheless faced frustration, as the playing grounds were judged insufficient for competition play. The team was subsequently excluded from major competitions until a more appropriate locale could be found.

Ultimately, Borussia acquired a patch of land on &quot;Reyerhütterstraße&quot; in Mönchengladbach to enable organized play, at a time when the growing spread of football made it more and more of a hassle in terms of property damage and noise pollution. By achieving access to its own football grounds, Borussia thus evaded the growing number of police actions that were launched to call football enthusiasts to order. Regular play continued, after more than a year of absence, in the second class of the second district, against teams like FC Mönchengladbach II, FC Eintracht Mönchengladbach and various teams from Düsseldorf and Krefeld, among others. After a 2–0 against Rheydt and two victories over Düsseldorf teams (4–1 against Britannia Düsseldorf, 4–1 against Union Düsseldorf), the first home game was held in &quot;Reyerhütterstraße&quot; against Preußen Krefeld. Borussia won the game with two goals difference.

At the end of the competition, Borussia was district champion, with eight wins in eight games (although Borussia had lost a 0–2 game against FC Mönchengladbach II that was subsequently annulled when FC Mönchengladbach II was disqualified from the competition), with 25 goals scored and only 8 conceded. But Borussia was skipped for promotion regardless; the club was once again assigned to the second class (now called &quot;B-Klasse&quot;) as a result of a league reform.

In 1907, Borussia left &quot;Reyerhütterstraße&quot;, where a new factory was under construction, and reached a deal with Gladbacher Turnverein 1848 to cooperatively run a ground near the &quot;Schweizerhaus&quot;, a famous gastronomy in the vicinity of the &quot;Kaiser-Friedrich-Halle&quot; de]. Games at the new grounds go well, with a 5–1 win over Borussia Köln, which had inflicted a painful 0–11 loss on Borussia in 1903, as well as a 5–3 against Rheydt. The season as a whole was mediocre for Borussia, ending with five wins, four losses and a draw at 19 goals scored and 13 conceded in third place. Borussia qualified for a promotion tournament to determine the team to be promoted to A class, but lost 0–6 to Viktoria Mönchengladbach.

The 1908–09 season was better for Borussia. After a 0–2 loss at home against FC Eintracht Mönchengladbach, Borussia regained its footing, beating Viktoria Mönchengladbach 4–1 in an away game and drawing them 2–2 at home. On 13 January 1909, Borussia scored an overwhelming 13–1 victory over Spiel und Sport Essen. Losing no game but the opener against Eintracht, Gladbach easily came first in the league, thus qualifying from Group South to face the promotion candidates from Group North, &quot;FC Cleve 06&quot;. After a resounding 5–1 win at home, the enthusiasm was dampened by a 3–4 setback in the away fixture. In the tiebreaker game, Borussia won 4–1, at last gaining promotion to the first division.

Going into the 1909–10 season, Borussia exchanged its previous black and white colour scheme with blue and yellow vertical stripes. Gladbach started into the higher league with significant issues, bringing Rheydt SpV only to a 2–2 at home before struggling with a crushing defeat in the 0–9 away fixture. The team ended the season with five wins, five losses and two draws in fourth place, avoiding relegation. The club&#x27;s tenth anniversary had seen a record 143 registered members, up from 32 in 1906 and 75 in 1908.

In the 1910–11 season, the league grew from seven to ten teams, adding opponents like Germania Hilden, FC Krefeld and Eintracht Mönchengladbach, bringing the game plan for Borussia to 18 games, not counting numerous friendly matches that brought the total number of games played to over 30, placing a significant strain on the amateur players. Aside from a noteworthy 11–2 victory over rivals Rheydt SV, the season was another mediocre performance for Borussia. The season forced Borussia to once again move the playing ground, after the &quot;Schweizerhaus&quot; grounds were deemed to dangerous in response to complaints by opposing teams. Borussia subsequently moved to grounds near the Catholic graveyard, and finished fourth in the league. The new grounds were known as &quot;Stadion am Rosengarten&quot;.

The 1911–12 season was the first major success in the club&#x27;s history. Borussia easily dominated the league with twelve wins, one draw and one loss, and thus earned qualification for promotion games towards &quot;Verbandsliga&quot; as northern district champions as well as the West German championship. Borussia defeated VfJuB Düren, the southern district champions, in a 4–2 game, before achieving a 5–0 blowout against VfB 1900 Gießen, the Hessian champions. Ultimately, Borussia lost the finals for the West German championship against Cologne BC 01, the precursor of Borussia&#x27;s greatest all-time rival, 1. FC Köln, at a 2–4 scoreline.

In a step down from the previous season&#x27;s outstanding performance, Borussia proved to struggle in the 1912–13 season. While the team was not threatened by relegation at any point in the tournament, Borussia ended in the middle of the table without a serious claim towards the title, and was no serious threat in the West German championship either. Borussia ended the season in sixth place in the league, at eight wins, two draws and eight losses.

In the last full season before the First World War, the German footballing structure was again reformed in the 1913–14 season. The system of two federation leagues (German: &quot;Verbandsliga&quot;) of twenty clubs each was replaced with a system of four district leagues (German: &quot;Kreisliga&quot;) of ten clubs each. This left Borussia in the Rhenish Northern District (German: &quot;Rheinischer Nordkreis&quot;) along with teams from Aachen and Düsseldorf, as well as other teams from Mönchengladbach. In the preparation for the season, Borussia performed miserably, losing 1–3 to Viktoria Duisburg and 1–6 to Duisburg SV. Borussia, nonetheless, entered the season with a clear goal to earn the district championship. The team fell well short of that target, coming third in the league at five wins, five draws and four losses. The highlight of the season was a friendly match against an English professional team. Dulwich Hamlet, which Borussia&#x27;s amateur footballers lost 2–5 (initially having led 2–1 by the 80th minute before conceding four goals in the last ten minutes).

===1914–1918: First World War===
In March 1914, the club purchased &quot;De Kull&quot;, a decommissioned gravel pit and the grounds on which the later Bökelbergstadion would be built. The First World War halted the progress of both the stadium and football in general, as many players volunteered or were drafted for military service. With rapidly changing player lineups, Borussia contested the war cup (German: &quot;Kriegspokal&quot;), beating Düren 7–0. In total, Borussia played 18 games in the 1914–15 season, in spite of the logistical difficulties caused by the war.

In time for the 1915–16 season, it had become clear that the war, initially anticipated by all sides to conclude quickly, would last longer than expected. Regardless, Borussia was able to assemble a functional team for the season (reinforced regularly by players on vacation from frontline duty), and played games against Union Krefeld, Viktoria Rheydt, Konstantia Kaldenkirchen, VfB Krefeld, FC Mönchengladbach and Eintracht Mönchengladbach. After a shaky start, including a 1–4 friendly game loss to Borussia Düsseldorf, Borussia found its footing in the league, and briefly rivalled Krefeld for the first place in January 1916. Ultimately, Borussia finished second in the league. By mid-1916, Borussia was forced to cease regular play due to the lack of regularly available players. By 4 November 1916, even the provisional club leadership had to cease operations, as too many of its members were called up for military service.

Borussia suffered several losses due to war casualties: The club&#x27;s chairman since 1912, Heinz Körstgens, was killed in action in 1915, as was Stephan Ditgens, Borussia player and uncle of Borussia&#x27;s first ever Germany national team player, Heinz Ditgens.

===1918–1933: during the Weimar Republic===
In the immediate aftermath of the military armistice of 11 November 1918, football clubs all over Germany began to gradually resume operations. Members of Borussia had informal meetings about the resumption of play even during the last months of the war, as early as mid-1918. The first recorded game of this phase was a 5–0 over Rheydt SV on 15 August 1918, followed by the turnaround in the form of a 2–7 thrashing at the hands of Rheydt SV in the return fixture a week later. The aftermath of the war interrupted the blossoming football of 1918–19, as only seven of Borussia&#x27;s 14 planned games were held due to the occupation of the region by the Belgian Armed Forces.

The decades-long struggle to find a usable locale to play continued, as &quot;De Kull&quot; was not yet ready to be used. By early 1919, the team returned to &quot;Schweizerhaus&quot; as a temporary measure. On 15 March 1919, FC Borussia merged with another local club, Turnverein Germania 1889, becoming 1889 VfTuR M.Gladbach. The club achieved its first major success in 1920, defeating Kölner BC 3–1 to win the 1920–1921 West German championship final.

The union between Germania and Borussia only lasted a matter of two years; the club was thereafter known as Borussia VfL 1900 e.V. M.Gladbach.

===1933–1945: football under the Third Reich===
Following the rise of the Nazi Party to power in 1933, the German league system was reformed to consist of 16 Gauligen – Gladbach found themselves playing first in the &quot;Gauliga Niederrhein&quot;, and later in various &quot;Bezirksklassen&quot; (district leagues). Also while under the Third Reich, Mönchengladbach&#x27;s first ever international player was capped; Heinz Ditgens playing in a 9–0 win over Luxembourg for Germany in the 1936 Olympic Games.

===1945–1959: rebuild after War===

Eventually, Mönchengladbach resumed play in June 1946, gaining successive promotions to the Landesliga Niederrhein (the regional second tier) in 1949 and the top flight, the Oberliga West, in 1950. Following many years of promotions and relegations, Borussia won their first &quot;Oberliga&quot; title in the 1958–59 season.

===1959–1965: promotion to the Bundesliga===
In August 1960, Borussia Mönchengladbach defeated 1. FC Köln in the West German Cup. Weeks later, the club won the DFB-Pokal, a first national honour, after defeating Karlsruher SC 3–2 in the final. Borussia therefore qualified for the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1960–61, where they were defeated 11–0 on aggregate by the Scottish club, Rangers. Rangers won 3–0 in Germany and 8–0 in Glasgow.

The following year, the club took on the now-familiar name Borussia VfL Mönchengladbach after the city of München-Gladbach became Mönchengladbach.

The 1961–62 season in the Oberliga ended again with Borussia in 13th place in the table. In 1962–63, the club hoped in vain to join the circle of DFB clubs which would start the following year in the newly founded Bundesliga. Helmut Beyer, who remained in office for 30 years, took over the responsibility of president that season and Helmut Grashoff took over as second chairman. In July 1962, Borussia signed Fritz Langner, who had won the West German championship in 1959 with Westfalia Herne, as their new coach. To Langner&#x27;s chagrin, the new leadership sold Albert Brüllsfor a record fee of 250,000 DM to FC Modena in Italy in order to rehabilitate the club financially. Helmut Grashoff, who collected the fee in Italian lira in cash in a suitcase, later said he had feared, after the money transfer, &quot;being thought a bank robber&quot;. The proceeds from the transfer enabled Langner to rebuild the squad with the signing of players like Heinz Lowin, Heinz Crawatzo and Siegfried Burkhardt. That year, the A-Youth team won the West German championship with a squad that included future professional footballers, Jupp Heynckes and Herbert Laumen.

Further honours would have to wait a decade. Borussia&#x27;s results in the ten years leading up to the formation of the Bundesliga in 1963 were not strong enough to earn them admission into the ranks of the nation&#x27;s new top flight professional league, and so the club played in the second tier, the Regionalliga West.

In the next season, 1964–65, the club signed the youngsters, Jupp Heynckes and Bernd Rupp, and some of the youth team joined the professional squad. Their average age of 21.5 years was the lowest of all regional league teams. They earned the nickname &quot;foals&quot; due to their low average age as well as their carefree and successful play. Reporter Wilhelm August Hurtmanns coined the nickname in his articles in the &quot;Rheinische Post&quot;. He was taken with the style of Borussia and wrote that they would play like young foals. By April 1965, the team had won the Regionalliga West and thus secured the participation in the Bundesliga promotion round in Group 1. This saw the team play against the competitors of Wormatia Worms (Second in the Regionalliga Südwest), SSV Reutlingen (Second in the Regionalliga Süd) and Holstein Kiel (Champions in the Regionalliga Nord) in first and second matches. Of the six games Borussia won three (5–1 in Worms, 1–0 against Kiel and 7–0 against Reutlingen). The achievement of the first place made promotion to the Bundesliga safe. Together with Borussia Bayern Munich rose by winning Group 2.

Mönchengladbach enjoyed its first taste of the Bundesliga in the 1965–66 season, earning promotion alongside future powerhouse Bayern Munich. The two clubs went on to engage in a fierce struggle, as they challenged each other for domestic supremacy throughout the 1970s. Bayern took first blood in the struggle for supremacy between the two: winning the Bundesliga championship in 1969. Mönchengladbach struck back immediately in the next season with a championship of their own and followed up with a second title in 1971, becoming the first Bundesliga club ever to successfully defend their title.

===1965–1969: early years in Bundesliga and struggles===

The commitment of Weisweiler as coach pointed the way for the sporting success of the club in the Bundesliga. The economic situation of the club did not allow to finance a team of stars. Weisweiler corresponded to the needs of the association with his attitude to promote the education and development of young talents. He pressed Players not in a fixed game system, but promoted individualism and gave them considerable freedom on the field. This resulted in a carefree and offensive style of playing, the hallmark of &quot;Fohlenelf&quot;.

The club signed with Berti Vogts and Heinz Wittmann, both players whose names should be closely linked to the sporting successes of Borussia.

The first Bundesliga match in the 1965–66 season took place away against Borussia Neunkirchen and ended 1–1, the first Bundesliga goal scorer was Gerhard Elfert. The first home game against SC Tasmania 1900 Berlin Borussia won 5–0. Weisweiler knew how to give the team tactical freedom and to promote the individual enthusiasm of the players. These freedoms cost the still immature team in the first Bundesliga season with a number of sometimes high defeats. The Borussia finished the first season in the Bundesliga on the 13th place in the table.

In the following season 1966–67 showed the scoring power of the Mönchengladbacher team, which scored 70 goals. The striker Herbert Laumen scored 18, Bernd Rupp 16 and Jupp Heynckes scored 14 goals. Due to the good goal difference, the team was able to complete the season on the eighth place in the table. With an 11–0 home win over FC Schalke 04 on Matchday 18, the team celebrated the first highest ever victory in Bundesliga history.

The successes had the side effect that the salaries of the players jumped up and thus good players were not easy to hold onto. Jupp Heynckes moved for the former record transfer fee of 275,000 DM to Hannover 96, Bernd Rupp moved to SV Werder Bremen, and Eintracht Braunschweig signed Gerhard Elfert. The club bought Peter Meyer and Peter Dietrich and thus compensated for the departure of seasoned players. With a 10–0 win on the twelfth match-day of the season 1967–68 over Borussia Neunkirchen, the team showed again their scoring power. The team reached in this and the next season third place in the table. The club signed in the season 1968–69 their future coach Horst Köppel, who had already had first experiences in the national team, and from hitherto unknown amateur VfL Schwerte the then long-time goalkeeper Wolfgang Kleff and Hartwig Bleidick, Gerd Zimmermann and Winfried Schäfer, who played ten seasons at Borussia.

===1970–1980: golden decade: dominance in the league and successes in Europe===

The 1970s went down as the most successful in the club&#x27;s history.

Under coach Hennes Weisweiler, the young side displayed an offensive-minded philosophy and powerful play that attracted fans from all over Germany.
Borussia won the championship five times, more than any other team in this time. At the same time a rivalry developed with FC Bayern Munich, with which Borussia together ascended in 1965 to the Bundesliga.

After the club had twice finished third in previous years, Hennes Weisweiler in the 1969–70 season coached especially the defence. Deviating from the &quot;foal&quot; concept, Borussia bought for the first time experienced defensive players like Luggi Müller and Klaus-Dieter Sieloff. With Ulrik le Fevre the club signed their first Danish player, later followed by Henning Jensen and Allan Simonsen. This season saw the first Bundesliga victory over Bayern. After a 5–1 win over Alemannia Aachen on 31 October 1969, Borussia topped the Bundesliga for the first time. Today (as of December 2018) Borussia takes third place in the list of league leaders in the Bundesliga behind Bayern and Dortmund.

On 30 April 1970, with a home win against Hamburger SV in the 33rd Round of the season, Borussia were named as champions.

On 16 September 1970, Herbert Laumen scored the first goal for Borussia in European club football in the 6–0 win against EPA Larnaca. The first round of the following season 1970–71 saw only one defeat for the club. In the history of the Bundesliga unique is an incident in the home game of the 27th matchday against Werder Bremen, known as the &quot;post break from Bökelberg&quot;. In the game on 3 April 1971, after a penalty area scene in the 88th minute, the striker Herbert Laumen overturned the left goal post after a head clash with the Bremen goalkeeper Günter Bernardinto. After unsuccessful attempts of repair, as no replacement goal could be set up, the referee stopped the game at the score of 1–1. The DFB sports court in Frankfurt rated the game as a 2–0 win for Bremen. As a consequence, the DFB obliged the clubs to provide a replacement for both goals. The championship was decided only on the last match day as a head-to-head race with Bayern Munich. Nine weeks after the post-break game, on 5 June 1971, Borussia were the first side in the history of the Bundesliga to defend their championship title, with a victory at Eintracht Frankfurt.

On 20 October 1971, in the European Cup, the champions took part in a &quot;can-throwing game&quot; in football history match against Inter Milan instead. Borussia won the match at Bökelbergstadion 7–1, but UEFA cancelled the game, as the Italian striker Roberto Boninsegna was hit by an empty coke can and received medical treatment. Coaching legend Matt Busby described the game of the colts:
After a 4–2 away defeat in Milan and a goalless draw in the replay at the Berlin Olympic Stadium, Borussia were eliminated from the Cup of the national champions.

&quot;Die Fohlen&quot; won 2-1 against 1. FC Köln in the Rheinland derby by a goal by Günter Netzer in 1973 to win their second DFB-Pokal. For Netzer this was the last game for Borussia: he left the club and moved to Real Madrid.

In addition to the game-winning scene in the 93rd minute from Netzer, there were numerous other highlights in the 30th cup final in history, &quot;that of the one best, playful highly interesting and exciting in the history of this competition in the annals entered and of which one could swarm only in highest tones&quot; ( Kicker ).

The first international final match took place on 9 May 1973. Liverpool won the UEFA Cup first-leg 3–0 on the second try after the game was cancelled the day before due to rain. On 23 May 1973, Borussia Mönchengladbach won the second-leg 2–0, but Liverpool won the cup by aggregate victory.

The following seasons were marked by the departure of well-known players, although the main Mönchengladbach striker remained. In the 1973–74 season, Jupp Heynckes&#x27;s 30 goals made him the top-scorer in the Bundesliga, the first Borussia Monchengladbach player to be so. In that first season following the departure of Günter Netzer, Borussia finished as runner-up to champions Bayern Munich by one point. With a total of 93 goals scored Borussia set a new club record. Borussia graduated in the following years 1972 to 1974, the championship in third and fifth place and vice-champion.

In the 1974–75 season, Borussia laid the foundation for a feat previously unheard of in the Bundesliga. On Matchday 17, the &quot;foals&quot; topped the league table and did not relinquish the league lead until winning the championship on 14 June 1975. The joy over the title was clouded by the departure of coach Hennes Weisweiler, who left the club after eleven years in the direction of Barcelona. The next international final with Mönchengladbach participation took place on 7 May 1975. The first leg of the UEFA Cup in Düsseldorf between Borussia and Twente ended goalless. The second leg on 21 May 1975 was won by the VfL 5: 1. With the highest away win in a UEFA Cup final, Borussia won their first international title.

Udo Lattek, who came from the rival Bayern Munich, although he had already signed with Rot-Weiss Essen, took over the club in the 1975–76 season. In contrast to the departed Weisweiler, Lattek represented a rather safety-first philosophy. The team topped the Championship on the twelfth round of the season, with a victory over Werder Bremen and Eintracht Braunschweig, and retained that lead to the end of the season.

On 3 March 1976, on Ash Wednesday, was the next international appearance of Borussia. In the European Champions Cup, Borussia Mönchengladbach played against Real Madrid, where now Günter Netzer and Paul Breitner were under contract, 2:2. In the second leg (17 March 1976), which ended 1–1, the referee Leonardus van der Kroft did not recognise two Mönchengladbach goals, in the 68th minute a goal by Henning Jensen and in the 83rd minute by Hans-Jürgen Wittkamp. Once a foul must have preceded the goal, once the referee decided on offside, although it had been not indicated by the linesman. The draw was enough for the Madrilenians to progress.

The team won three consecutive titles from 1975 to 1977. On 12 June 1976, Mönchengladbach won a fourth league title.

In the 1976–77 season, Lattek went with an almost unchanged team at the start. As Wolfgang Kleff was injured, the club signed a new goalkeeper. In Wolfgang Kneib, who came from SV Wiesbaden, Lattek found a safe substitute. Borussia needed one point to defend the title on the final day. The match took place away against Bayern Munich, then sixth in the table, and ended 2:2 by an own goal in the 90th minute by Hans-Jürgen Wittkamp. Borussia made the hat-trick and won on 21 May 1977 for the third consecutive time and for the fifth time overall the German championship title. The Dane Allan Simonsen received after this season the award as Europe&#x27;s Footballer of the Year with the Ballon d&#x27;Or.

The team narrowly missed a fourth consecutive championship title in season 1977–78: Monchengladbach lost out to 1. FC Köln only by a worse goal difference. Borussia won against Borussia Dortmund 12–0 on the final day of the season, still the highest victory in the history of the Bundesliga. However, the Domstädter won their last game 5:0 at FC St. Pauli: they had a better goal difference by three goals and so won the championship. For the first time in the Bundesliga first and second were tied after the end of the season. Borussia would have been able to decide the championship in their favour had they won the match against 1. FC Cologne a few weeks earlier. However, the game ended in a draw, with Cologne player Heinz Flohe netting a vital 83rd-minute equaliser.

Although Mönchengladbach lost the 1977 final of the European Cup to Liverpool in Rome (25 May 1977), they also made four appearances in the UEFA Cup, with wins in 1975 and 1979 against losses in 1973 and 1980. The club&#x27;s run had come to an end with eight trophies to their credit, and although they would continue to be competitive for many years, success would be much harder to come by.

In the following season 1978–79 Udo Lattek managed Borussia for the last time. Many regulars left the club, such as the later vice-president Rainer Bonhof, or announced their career end, such as Jupp Heynckes and Berti Vogts. Lattek did not succeed in offsetting these departures with appropriate new signings. On Matchday 30, the team was in 15th place with a goal-difference of 38:47 goals: three wins from the last four games improved the finish to tenth place. It was the first season in a long time in which the club finished with a negative goal difference. Borussia signed Jupp Heynckes to be assistant coach to Lattek this season. The second international title started on 9 May 1979. The first leg in the UEFA Cup against Red Star Belgrade ended in a draw. In the second leg on 23 May 1979, Borussia won 1–0 at home to win the UEFA Cup for the second time.

After the departure of Lattek in the 1979–80 season, the club appointed Jupp Heynckes head coach. The season was marked by two new entries. The club signed Harald Nickel of Eintracht Braunschweig. With a transfer fee of 1.15 million DM this was the hitherto most expensive new purchase. From Herzogenaurach came Lothar Matthäus. Borussia finished the season in seventh place. On 7 May 1980, Borussia Mönchengladbach was again in a final for the UEFA Cup. At home, the team won against Eintracht Frankfurt 3–2. In the second leg on 21 May 1980, Eintracht Frankfurt won 1–0 against Borussia Mönchengladbach and secured the trophy due to the larger number of away goals scored.

===1980–1996: slowdown===

In the 1980s, Borussia could no longer build on the titles they accumulated in the past decade and fell behind Bayern Munich. Due to the lack of ticket revenue from the small Bökelbergstadion, the club had to sell top performers repeatedly. Nevertheless, it was possible to settle frequently in the upper third of the Bundesliga and play in the championship fight. In the 1980–81 season, many long-time players left the club, including Karl Del&#x27;Haye, the first player signed by Bayern with hostile intent. Borussia committed with Wolfram Wuttke only to striking players. They replaced Wolfgang Kleff in goal to Uli Sude. The team reached this season&#x27;s sixth place in the table. The sporting record did not improve in the following two seasons. With a seventh-place finish in 1982, Borussia missed participation in European competitions. The following year, Uwe Kamps guarded the goal for the first time, eventually becoming a key player.

In the 1983–84 season, Borussia contested the title. With Bernd Krauss, Michael Frontzeck and Uli Borowka, Borussia committed players who played for a long time successfully for the club. In the end, they landed tied behind VfB Stuttgart and Hamburger SV in third place. It was the first time in the history of the Bundesliga that three clubs tied the table on the last matchday. In the same season, Mönchengladbach also lost the DFB-Pokal final to Bayern Munich on penalties, Lothar Matthäus and Norbert Ringels both missing from the spot after the game originally ended all square at 1–1. Matthäus subsequently joined Bayern for a then-record fee of 2.25 million DM, leading some fans to question whether he had deliberately missed his penalty.

In the 1984–85 season, Borussia won 10–0 on Matchday 8 against Eintracht Braunschweig, which is so far the last two-digit victory in Bundesliga history. In the semi-finals of the German Cup VfL met again at Bayern Munich. After no goals had been scored in the regular season in Munich&#x27;s Olympiastadion, Søren Lerby converted a penalty kick against Borussia goalkeeper Ulrich Sude in the 101st minute. This remained the only goal of the evening, so that Borussia missed the entry into the final.

The season 1985–86 brought no sporting highlights in the Bundesliga, with the club finishing fourth. Borussia Mönchengladbach gave away a 5–1 win over Real Madrid on 27 November 1985 in Düsseldorf (11 December 1985), when the club lost 4–0 in Madrid and dropped out of the UEFA Cup.

In the 1986–87 season, there was once again a coaching change. Jupp Heynckes announced his move to Bayern Munich. The club nominated Wolf Werner as the new coach. At the end of the season, Borussia stood with the third place in the table for the last time in this decade at a UEFA Cup place. The Association of German Sports Journalists voted Uwe Rahn &quot;Player of the Year&quot;. Again Borussia reached the semi-finals of the DFB Cup. But also this time Borussia lost against the later DFB Cup winner Hamburger SV. On 22 April 1987, Borussia lost against the Scottish representative Dundee United after defeat at home in Bökelberg in the UEFA Cup semi-final. It was also the first defeat in a European Cup game on the Bökelberg. After the departure of Jupp Heynckes, the era of long-standing engagements of head coaches ended. In the first 23 years from 1964 to 1987, Borussia only had three instructors; Since the departure of Heynckes, Borussia had committed 16 new coaches until 2008, with the exception of interim solutions. It was Werner&#x27;s release on 21 November 1989 that saw first premature dismissal of a coach at Borussia at all. Only three later coaches managed to succeed in Mönchengladbach for more than three years, Bernd Krauss (1992–1996), Hans Meyer (1999–2003) and Lucien Favre (2011–2015).

In the next season, Borussia signed Stefan Effenberg, a player who worked long and successfully for the club. Borussia finished the season in seventh place and thus missed the participation in international competitions. The early 1990s followed a significant downward trend. As a result of the sporting decline, the number of spectators at the Bökelberg was declining for the first time. Already in the 1989–90 season, the club had fought against relegation. In the following years, Borussia placed in the midfield of the league. In the 1991–92 season, Borussia played again a good cup season. In the Cup semi-final, goalkeeper Uwe Kamps saved all four penalties against Bayer Leverkusen, and Borussia reached the final. The final on 23 May 1992 saw the Mönchengladbachers lose against the club from second division Hannover 96 3–4 on penalties.

In 1993, the club signed the players Heiko Herrlich and Patrik Andersson, and in 1994, Stefan Effenberg came back, who played for Borussia Mönchengladbach from 1987 to 1990. Under coach Bernd Krauss, they managed a renewed connection to the Bundesliga top end. In the 1994–95 season came the first trophy for Borussia since 1979, where they won the DFB-Pokal with a 3–0 victory over VfL Wolfsburg. Borussia would also win the Supercup against the German champions Borussia Dortmund a few months later.

===1996–2010: firm decline and new stadium===

The team&#x27;s performance slipped in the 1990s and &quot;Die Fohlen&quot; soon found themselves struggling in the lower half of the Bundesliga table.

After the first round of the 1996–97 season, Borussia finished 17th place in the table. The club dismissed coach Krauss due to the sporting failure. At the end of the season, the Mönchengladbacher were in eleventh place. None of the other four coaches who followed Krauss remained in office for more than a year. Under Friedel Rausch, Borussia could only remain in the Bundesliga after a dramatic season finale in 1998. Before the last matchday, the Borussia were three points above the relegation zone. On the final day of the season, they managed a 2–0 away win at VfL Wolfsburg; Karlsruher SC lost to Hansa Rostock and went down due to the worse goal difference.

In the international arena, the season was disappointing despite two victories in the first round of the UEFA Cup against Arsenal. Borussia lost in the second round of the first leg 2–4 against Monaco, the most recent victory Borussia reached with a 1–0 in Monaco, but were eliminated from the competition. In the 1998–99 season, Borussia won 3–0 against Schalke 04 on Matchday 1 and was at the top of the table for the first time in 13 years. As a result, the team lost six matches and drew two draws, so they stood on the ninth day at the bottom of the table. On the tenth and eleventh round followed by a 2:8 defeat against Bayer Leverkusen and a 1:7 at Vfl Wolfsburg, two consecutive heavy defeats. The team remained until the end of the season in 18th place. After a total of 21 lost games, the consequence was the first relegation from the Bundesliga. As a consequence of the relegation, several top performers, including goalkeeper Robert Enke, defender Patrik Andersson, and midfielder Karlheinz Pflipsen and Sebastian Deisler all left the club.

Finally, in 1999, Gladbach were relegated to 2. Bundesliga, where they would spend two seasons. Upon returning to the Bundesliga in 2001, Mönchengladbach continued to be in the bottom half of the league.

The first season in the 2. Bundesliga started the same way as the previous one ended. In the DFB Cup, the team were knocked out early after a lost penalty shootout against the regional league SC Verl. The second division season 1999–2000 ended the Borussia despite a bad first round still in fifth place in the table. Four points were missing for direct promotion.
On 1 August 2000, Borussia Mönchengladbach celebrated the 100-year anniversary of the club. As part of the celebrations, next to coach Hennes Weisweiler the following players were elected by Borussia supporters in the so-called century Elf: As goalkeeper Wolfgang Kleff, in defence Berti Vogts, Hans-Günter Bruns, Wilfried Hannes and Patrik Andersson, in midfield Rainer Bonhof, Stefan Effenberg, Herbert Wimmer, and Günter Netzer, and in attack Jupp Heynckes and Allan Simonsen. Later, large-format posters with images of the players on the north and east sides were attached to the steel exterior of the stadium in Borussia Park.

In the 2000–01 season, the team was able to celebrate as a runner-up in the Bundesliga 2 re-emergence in the Bundesliga and reached the semi-finals of the DFB Cup, but were knocked out as in the previous year against a Regionalligisten ( Union Berlin ) on penalties. Borussia won first place in the national fair play ranking in 2002 in the draw for a place in the UEFA Cup, but the lot was not drawn. Also in the season 2003–04 Borussia missed participation in the UEFA Cup. On 17 March 2004, the Borussia were eliminated by a 0–1 defeat against the then second division Alemannia Aachen in the semi-finals of the DFB Cup. A victory against the Alemannia would have been enough, because the final opponent Werder Bremen was already qualified for the UEFA Champions League due to the table position. The season was under the motto &quot;Bye Bye Bökelberg&quot;, because on 22 May 2004, the last Bundesliga match took place in Bökelbergstadion. The Borussia defeated 1860 Munich 3:1; the last goal on Bökelberg was headed by Arie van Lent. Uwe Kamps came on in the 82nd minute and came to his 457th match in the Bundesliga.

In 2004, Mönchengladbach appointed Dick Advocaat, who had guided the Netherlands national team to the semi-finals of UEFA Euro 2004 and was a successful manager at Rangers, as their new coach. However, Advocaat was unable to have much success and resigned in April of the following year. Former Mönchengladbach player and German international Horst Köppel was appointed caretaker for the remaining five fixtures of the season. Köppel had managed the club&#x27;s reserves since leaving Borussia Dortmund in June 2004. For the 2006–07 season, former Mönchengladbach player and coach Jupp Heynckes was appointed as team coach.
Borussia had taken steps to improve their financial situation with the construction of their new stadium called Borussia-Park with a permitted capacity of 59,771 spectators (limited to 54,067 for Bundesliga games and to 46,249 for international games). The club had long been hindered by playing in a much smaller and older facility (Bökelberg, capacity 34,500), and with the opening of the new stadium in 2004 can look forward to increased revenues through higher ticket sales and the ability to host lucrative international matches.

On the 31st matchday of the 2006–07 season, Borussia Mönchengladbach were relegated from the Bundesliga after Arminia Bielefeld won against Werder Bremen 3–2, while Mönchengladbach lost 1–0 at home to VfB Stuttgart. They were promoted back to the Bundesliga on the 32nd match-day of the 2007–08 season after winning the match against SV Wehen 3–0.

===2010–2017: revival===

For the 110th anniversary of the club, the club brought out a DVD on which the club&#x27;s story is told in a 110-minute film. On 28 July 2010, it was premiered in a cinema in Mönchengladbach.

In the 2010-11 DFB Cup, for the first time after five years the round of 16 was reached. In the Bundesliga, they succeeded after 16 years in getting the first victory against Bayer Leverkusen, but at the end of the preliminary round, the club were in last place.

Due to the seasonally poor athletic performance, a merger of leaders from the local economy founded the &quot;initiative Borussia&quot;, which accused the club management of mismanagement. According to the initiative, the old, encrusted structures should be dissolved in order to give Borussia a future. So the money should be invested in the sport rather than in the planned museum complex with attached hotel. At the 2011 Annual General Meeting, only 335 of the 4769 members present voted in favour of the initiative&#x27;s goals.

At the Bundesliga home game against Mainz 05, Marco Reus scored the 2500th Bundesliga goal in the 1445th game. Other Jubiläumstorschützen were Jupp Heynckes (500), Carsten Nielsen (1000), Uwe Rahn (1500) and Martin Dahlin (2000).
The first newcomer in the winter break was the free transfer of striker Mike Hanke of Hannover 96. The defence was reinforced with Håvard Nordtveit and Martin Stranzl. On 13 February 2011, Michael Frontzeck was dismissed due to continued failure as a coach. Decisive were defeats against the direct relegation competitors VfB Stuttgart and FC St. Pauli. Lucien Favre was hired as the new head coach. After the team had been in the last place in the table until the 30th match day, they achieved three consecutive wins and reached 16th place after a 1–1 draw at the last game day, which allowed one last chance to remain in the league. Borussia competed in two relegation matches against the second league team VfL Bochum and were able to prevent relegation with a 1–0 at home and a 1–1 draw in Bochum.

Under Favre, who took over in January 2011, Borussia Mönchengladbach has in recent years shown ambitions to re-establish themselves in the top regions of the Bundesliga. In the 2010–11 season, after a disastrous first half of the season, Borussia Mönchengladbach managed to narrowly avoid relegation through the post-season relegation play-offs.

The following season, 2011–12, followed this up with a strong season in which they were for much of the year in contention for the championship and eventually finished in fourth place. They missed out on qualification to the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League after losing 4–3 on aggregate to Ukrainian club Dynamo Kyiv in the playoff round. During the 2012–13 Bundesliga season, after losing some key players, notably Marco Reus who was voted player of the year in the Bundesliga in the previous season, Borussia Mönchengladbach still contended for the international places until the last match day, eventually finishing in eighth place.

In the 2013–14 Bundesliga season, they had another very successful year, achieving an excellent third-place after the first half of the season and finishing the season in sixth place, entering them into the 2014–15 Europa League competition at the play-off stage. They finished the 2014–15 Bundesliga season in third place, saving the club a place for direct qualification to the 2015–16 UEFA Champions League group stage. The club found itself in a tough group, together with Juventus, Manchester City and Sevilla, and, although they finished bottom of the group, they claimed a respectable points tally of five, claiming draws home and away against Juventus and defeating eventual Europa League winners Sevilla 4–2 at home.
After a poor start to the 2015–16 Bundesliga season, including five defeats, Favre resigned and was replaced with André Schubert as interim coach. The club&#x27;s fortunes immediately changed, as it won six-straight Bundesliga matches and eventually finishing the season in fourth position, earning qualification to the Champions League for a second successive season.

In the 2016–17 season, Borussia drew a difficult group in the Champions League, but managed to finish in third place above Celtic and qualify for the UEFA Europa League knockout phase. However, after a promising start in the Bundesliga, the club experienced a poor run of form exacerbated by injuries, and had dropped to the 14th position by the winter break. As a result, André Schubert resigned and was replaced by ex-VfL Wolfsburg manager Dieter Hecking. Hecking began with three wins in four Bundesliga matches as Borussia rose to ninth place and also earned a place in the quarter-finals of the DFB-Pokal.

===2017–present: ascent to the top half of the table===
A new record transfer was made by the club for the season. For the German international and world champion Matthias Ginter, the club transferred 17 million euros plus bonus payments to Borussia Dortmund.
In the ninth edition of the Telekom Cup, Borussia had as early as January of the same year again to be content with the fourth and last place after a defeat on penalties against Werder Bremen and against 1899 Hoffenheim. The first round of the DFB Cup 2017–18 was able to make Borussia victorious. The VfL won the West duel against Rot-Weiss Essen 2–1. In the league prelude, the &quot;Fohlenelf&quot; kept by a goal of Nico Elvedi 1–0 in the Rheinland derby against 1. FC Köln the upper hand and &quot;overwintered&quot; after a final 3–1 home win against Hamburger SV to half-time as sixth with 28 points from eight wins, four draws and five defeats. In the DFB Cup Borussia were eliminated on 20 December 2017 in the last competitive game of the year after a 0–1 defeat in the second round against Bayer Leverkusen in the Borussia-Park at home, after the &quot;Werkself&quot; had already on the 9th matchday of the Bundesliga at the same place won 5–1. The second round match failed; the decisive goal to 1–2 defeat at 1. FC Köln fell in the fifth minute of stoppage time. By contrast, the financial data in the 2017 financial year was more positive. Despite a lack of participation in international competitions, the association posted the second-best result in its history with a turnover of 179.3 million euros and a profit after tax of 6.56 million euros after the record year 2016. The 2017–18 season ended for Borussia after a 1–2 defeat at Hamburger SV left them in ninth place and thus missed, as in the previous year, the qualification for the European competitions. The game was also the last for Hamburg in the highest German league after 55 years of uninterrupted affiliation.

In July 2018, the French striker Alassane Pléa from Nice arrived for the record sum of 23 million euros. In the first round of the 2018–19 DFB-Pokal, Mönchengladbach defeated BSC Hastedt 11–1. Thus, Borussia surpassed the previous record, which had been set by the club in an 8–0 victory in the away game at 1. FC Viersen in the first round of the 1977–78 DFB-Pokal.

In the 2019–20 Bundesliga, Mönchengladbach started the season well, and was on top of the league in December 2019, after defeating Bayern Munich 2–1. However, a shaky run of results in the second half of the season meant they ultimately finished in fourth place, 17 points behind champions Bayern. Mönchengladbach thus qualified for the UEFA Champions League, and were drawn against Inter Milan, Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk. Borussia achieved their largest win in the Champions League with a 6–0 win over Shakhtar Donetsk, with Alassane Pléa scoring a hat-trick. They advanced to the knockout stage after finishing second place in Group B, but were ultimately knocked out in the round of 16 by Manchester City.

==Culture==
In addition to celebrity fans like Theo Zwanziger, Wolfgang Thierse, Sven Ottke, Kai Ebel, Mickie Krause, Matthias Opdenhövel, Peer Steinbrück and Hannelore Kraft, there are fan clubs in many countries, as far as California, South Africa and New Zealand. A known fan group of the club were &quot;Steinwegs Mamm&quot;, who provided the drum in the 1960s for the team, and Ethem Özenrenler, known by his nickname &quot;Manolo&quot;, who beat the drum in the northern curve of the Bökelberg Stadium for over 25 years since 1977.

===Friendships and rivalries===

====Friendship with Politehnica Timisoara====

====Friendship with FSV Mainz 05====
After the DFB Cup match against the Mainz 05 on 25 October 1994, a 6–4 win for Mönchengladbach, a fan friendship developed between Mainz and Borussia, which is now maintained by only a few supporters.

====Friendship with Liverpool====
On the other hand, there is a long friendship with Liverpool, which comes from the time both teams regularly met in international games. Fans of Borussia travel to Liverpool at regular intervals to watch local Reds games. Conversely, followers from Liverpool still use a visit to Mönchengladbach to symbolise the mutual fan friendship of both clubs. The fans of Mönchengladbach collected 21,000 DM for the families of the 96 dead in the stadium disaster in Sheffield (1989) and presented it to Liverpool in 1991 in Mönchengladbach. For the 110th anniversary of the club on 1 August 2010, Liverpool were the opponents in a friendly match. The match in front of 51,515 spectators in the Borussia Park Mönchengladbach was won by Borussia, 1–0.

====Rivalry with FC Köln====
By contrast, there is a strong sporting rivalry between Mönchengladbach and the regional rival 1. FC Köln. Widely considered the most severe of Mönchengladbach&#x27;s rivalries, the animosities between Mönchengladbach and Cologne had their spark in 1964, when Cologne manager Hennes Weisweiler switched allegiance in favour of Mönchengladbach. Weisweiler is a central figure in both clubs&#x27; mythologies; the mascot of Cologne is named &quot;Hennes&quot; in his honour, whereas Mönchengladbach venerates Weisweiler as the coach of its &quot;team of the century&quot;. Mönchengladbach&#x27;s stadium, Borussia-Park, is furthermore located at a road named &quot;Hennes-Weisweiler-Allee&quot; in Weisweiler&#x27;s memory.

This initial outrage on behalf of FC Köln supporters was soon met with a serious sporting rivalry: Although Cologne initially had had the athletic edge as a founding member of the Bundesliga and the league&#x27;s first champion, Mönchengladbach quickly closed the gap. Between the seasons 1969–70 and 1977–78, Mönchengladbach won five championships, Cologne won one, and Bayern Munich secured the remaining three. The 77–78 season has become remembered in both club&#x27;s collective memories: Although Mönchengladbach defeated Borussia Dortmund in the highest victory in Bundesliga history with a crushing 12–0, Cologne carried the championship with a 5–0 win over FC St. Pauli due to their slightly better goal difference (+45 versus +42 in Cologne&#x27;s favour). To add insult to injury, Cologne was back under the leadership of Hennes Weisweiler, the personified point of contention between both clubs.

Although neither club has been able to win a Bundesliga title since the 1977–78 season, the rivalry remains, with several incidents of violence between supporters of both clubs. Overall, Mönchengladbach has been more successful in matches between the two, winning 54 out of 105 duels, drawing 20 and losing 31. Notably, Mönchengladbach is more likely to win than FC Köln even in away matches (24–10–17 in Mönchengladbach&#x27;s favour). The first iteration of Borussia vs FC Köln was played on 1 January 1961 in front of a crowd of 11,000 in Oberliga West (1947–63). Cologne defeated Mönchengladbach 4–1.

====Other rivalries====
* Bayern Munich: both Mönchengladbach and Munich had not been starters in the Bundesliga – each won their right to a spot starting with the 1965–66 season. Munich finished third, Mönchengladbach 13th. Both clubs rose to dominance between the 1969–70 and 1976–77 seasons, when five championships went to Mönchengladbach and three to Munich. However, with Mönchengladbach&#x27;s decline in the 1980s and 1990s, Munich could firmly assert its dominance in both the Bundesliga and in the direct comparisons with Borussia: out of 119 matches played Munich won 58, Mönchengladbach won 29 and the two clubs drew 32. However, Mönchengladbach has remained a notable wildcard with the ability to inflict painful defeats on Munich, for example when Igor de Camargo scored the decisive goal in the 1–0 victory in the first ever game of goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and defender Jérôme Boateng at Munich on 7 August 2011. Gladbach was also able to escape Munich in 2015 with a 0–2 victory, one of the few victories over Bayern in their home stadium, as well as being a rare domestic loss for then-Bayern manager, Pep Guardiola. On 27 October 2021, Gladbach beat Bayern 5–0 in a DFB Pokal (German Cup) match, the worst Bayern loss since 1978 in any competition.
* Borussia Dortmund: while not nearly as pronounced as Dortmund&#x27;s rivalry against Schalke 04 or Mönchengladbach&#x27;s own struggle against 1. FC Köln, Dortmund and Mönchengladbach still occasionally lock horns, mostly because of the naming similarity – both are the two &quot;Borussias&quot; of the Bundesliga. The song &quot;Es gibt nur eine Borussia&quot; (&#x27;there is only one Borussia&#x27;) is popular among Mönchengladbach supporters when facing Dortmund squads. The duel between the two has been dubbed the &quot;Borussengipfel&quot;, the &quot;Borussia Summit&quot;, in the media.
===Songs===
The official club anthem is the song &quot;The Eleven of the Lower Rhine&quot;, which is sung before every home game. The song was recorded by the group BO, the band of the fan project. Next to them are the songs &quot;We are Borussia&quot; and &quot;The soul burns&quot; a permanent place in the fan scene. The anthem by Gerry &amp; the Pacemakers, &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;, which is sung by numerous clubs around Europe is frequently heard.

The goal song (), which is heard after every home game, is the refrain of Scooter&#x27;s &quot;Maria (I Like It Loud)&quot;. It is accompanied by the sonorous announcement &quot;Tor für die Borussia&quot;, by Rolf Göttel, who worked as honorary announcer of Borussia in Bökelbergstadion for decades.

===Mascot===
A first mascot was created by manager Helmut Grasshoff and was called &quot;Bumsi&quot;. The head was a Telstar-style ball with eyes and black, curly hair. The official mascot of the club since the season opener in 1998 is the foal &quot;Jünter&quot;, whose name refers to the Mönchengladbach native and longtime Borussia player Günter Netzer.

Many parts of the island have been modified by human development since the arrival of coconut plantations in the 17th century, but it remains largely white coral sand with mangrove forest at its center. Its eastern coast runs parallel to the northernmost stretch of the Belize Barrier Reef, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

A Maya community lived on the island in Pre-Columbian times, leaving behind distinctive polished red ceramics. It is widely believed that maritime trade motivated the Mayans themselves to excavate &quot;Boca Bacalar Chico&quot;, the marine channel that separates the island from the Mexican mainland, but its origins could also have been natural (e.g. a hurricane).

San Pedro Town is the largest settlement and only town on Ambergris Caye. There are also a number of small villages and resorts that serve the island&#x27;s growing tourism industry, especially ecotourism and scuba diving. Although administered as part of the Belize District, the closest point on the mainland is part of the Corozal District.

== Etymology ==
Ambergris, from the Old French &quot;ambre gris&quot; (literally &quot;gray amber&quot;), is a rare substance produced in the intestines of sperm whales, valuable historically and in some modern perfumes as a fixative. In the 17th century, whalers in the tropical Atlantic Ocean operated from many islands like Ambergris Caye, and although sperm whales are not considered residents of Belizean waters, the animals continue to pass through on a regular basis.

== Tourism ==
Tourism development of Ambergris Caye began in the early 1970s and grew considerably in the later years of the 20th century. The main attractions are the Belize Barrier Reef and its beaches. That barrier reef is the second largest in the world, after the Great Barrier Reef of Australia. The caye has a small airstrip serviced by Tropic Air and Maya Island Air, whilst Astrum Helicopters services not only to the local airstip but the various resorts as well. It can be reached by plane or helicopter from Belize City as well as by numerous fast sea ferries. Ambergris Caye can also be reached by ferry from Chetumal in Mexico.

Ambergris Caye is commonly referred to as the &quot;Isla Bonita&quot; (English translation: &#x27;The Beautiful Island&#x27;), after Madonna&#x27;s 1987 hit &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; mentioned a place called San Pedro (although Madonna has said the song does not refer to any particular place). Ambergris Caye is famous for the turquoise seascapes surrounding the island which matches the character and Caribbean charm of the destination. Because of the island&#x27;s small size, the main form of powered transportation is by golf cart.

San Pedro Day is celebrated annually on June 27.

== Gallery ==
== Secret Beach ==
The majority of Ambergris Caye is reserved for national park/wildlife preserve limiting the availability of real estate. To the north of San Pedro Town is the destination of Belize Secret Beach, one of the more popular beach destinations in Belize. The Belize Secret Beach destination on Ambergris Caye is often called &quot;San Pedro&#x27;s worst kept secret&quot;, as the Secret Beach area has yet to see substantial development, but has become an increasingly popular destination for tourists and locals, allowing the area to boast a remote atmosphere but still offer more developed amenities. Secret Beach also features cenotes, sinkholes, and caves.

== In popular culture ==
Two resorts north of San Pedro played host to the first season of Fox&#x27;s &quot;Temptation Island&quot; in 2000, aired in 2001.

<doc id="263471" wikidata="Q249183" url="?curid=263471" title="Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster">
<text>Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster ( 1278 – 22 March 1322) was an English nobleman of the first House of Lancaster of the royal Plantagenet Dynasty. He was Earl of Lancaster, Leicester, and Derby from 1296 to 1322, and Earl of Lincoln and Salisbury &quot;jure uxoris&quot; from 1311 to 1322. As one of the most powerful barons of England, Thomas was one of the leaders of the baronial opposition to his first cousin, King Edward II.

== Early life and marriage ==
Thomas was the eldest son of Edmund Crouchback and Blanche of Artois, Queen Dowager of Navarre and niece of King Louis IX of France. Crouchback was the son of King Henry III of England. Through his mother, Thomas was a half-brother of Queen Joan I of Navarre.

His marriage to Alice de Lacy was not successful. They had no children together, while he fathered, illegitimately, two sons named John and Thomas. In 1317 Alice was abducted from her manor at Canford, Dorset, by Richard de St Martin, a knight in the service of John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey. This incident caused a feud between Lancaster and Surrey; Lancaster seized two of Surrey&#x27;s castles in retaliation. King Edward then intervened, and the two earls came to an uneasy truce. Thomas continued to hold the powerful earldoms of Lincoln and Salisbury. This was due to the marriage contract the two families had agreed; upon the death of his father-in-law, Thomas would hold these earldoms in his own right, not, as would be expected, in right of his wife.

==Earl of Lancaster==

On reaching full age he became hereditary sheriff of Lancashire, but spent most of the next ten years fighting for Edward I in Scotland, leaving the shrievalty in the care of deputies. He was present at the Battle of Falkirk in 1298 as part of Edward I&#x27;s wing of the army.

He served in the coronation of his cousin, King Edward II of England, on 25 February 1308, carrying Curtana, the sword of Edward the Confessor. At the beginning of the king&#x27;s reign, Lancaster openly supported Edward, but as the conflict between the king and the nobles wore on, Lancaster&#x27;s allegiances changed. He despised the royal favourite, Piers Gaveston, who mocked him as &quot;the Fiddler&quot;, and swore revenge when Gaveston demanded that the king dismiss one of Lancaster&#x27;s retainers.

Lancaster was one of the Lords Ordainers who demanded the banishment of Gaveston and the establishment of a baronial oligarchy. His private army helped separate the king and Gaveston, and Lancaster was one of the &quot;judges&quot; who convicted Gaveston and saw him executed in 1312.

After the disaster at Bannockburn in 1314, Edward submitted to Lancaster, who in effect became ruler of England. He attempted to govern for the next four years, but was unable to keep order or prevent the Scots from raiding and retaking territory in the North. In 1318 his popularity with the barons declined and he was persuaded &quot;to accept a diminished authority.&quot;

== Death ==
The new leadership, eventually headed by Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester, and his son Hugh Despenser the Younger, proved no more popular with the baronage, and in 1321 Lancaster was again at the head of a rebellion. This time he was defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge on 16 March 1322, and taken prisoner.

Lancaster was tried by a tribunal consisting of, among others, the two Despensers; Edmund Fitzalan, 9th Earl of Arundel; and King Edward. Lancaster was not allowed to speak in his own defence, nor was he allowed to have anyone to speak for him. He was convicted of treason and sentenced to death. Because of their kinship and Lancaster&#x27;s royal blood, the king commuted the sentence to beheading, as opposed to being hanged, drawn and beheaded, and Lancaster was executed on 22 March 1322 near Pontefract Castle.

Upon his death, his titles and estates were forfeited, and the Scots, whom Lancaster gained aid from in his rebellion, mainly to weaken the English in their war, seized the opportunity to take his inheritance in the Great Raid of 1322. In 1323, his younger brother Henry successfully petitioned to take possession of the earldom of Leicester, and in 1326 or 1327 Parliament posthumously reversed Thomas&#x27;s conviction, and Henry was further permitted to take possession of the earldoms of Lancaster, Derby, Salisbury and Lincoln.

Soon after Thomas&#x27;s death, miracles were reported at his tomb at Pontefract, and he became venerated as a martyr and saint. In 1327 the Commons petitioned Edward III to ask for his canonisation, and popular veneration continued until the reformation.

On 23 March 1822, Thomas&#x27;s remains were discovered in a large stone coffin buried in a field in the parish of Ferry Fryston. In 1942 it was reported by E. J. Rudsdale that some of Thomas&#x27;s bones had been found in a box at Paskell&#x27;s auctioneers in Colchester, Essex, having been removed from Pontefract Castle in 1885.

== Titles and lands ==

From his father, Thomas inherited the earldoms of Lancaster, Leicester and a Ferrers earldom of Derby.
By his marriage to Alice de Lacy, Countess of Lincoln, daughter and heiress of Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln, he became Earl of Lincoln, Earl of Salisbury, 11th Baron of Halton and 7th Lord of Bowland upon the death of his father-in-law in 1311. Master of five earldoms, he was one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in England. Thomas was in possession of many key fortresses, including Clitheroe Castle, particularly in northern England. He was responsible for the extension of Pontefract Castle and in 1313 he began the construction of Dunstanburgh Castle, a massive fortress in Northumberland.

== Arms ==
Inherited from his father, Thomas bore the arms of the kingdom, differenced by a &quot;label France of three points (that is to say azure three fleur-de-lys or, each)&quot;.

==Genealogical table==
Thomas was closely related to both the Capetian kings of France and the Plantagenet kings of England. His contemporaries commented that &quot;as each parent was of royal stock, he was clearly of nobler descent than the other earls&quot;.

<doc id="263472" wikidata="Q197492" url="?curid=263472" title="SciPy">
<text>SciPy (pronounced &quot;sigh pie&quot;) is a free and open-source Python library used for scientific computing and technical computing.

SciPy contains modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, ODE solvers and other tasks common in science and engineering.

SciPy is also a family of conferences for users and developers of these tools: SciPy (in the United States), EuroSciPy (in Europe) and SciPy.in (in India). Enthought originated the SciPy conference in the United States and continues to sponsor many of the international conferences as well as host the SciPy website.

The SciPy library is currently distributed under the BSD license, and its development is sponsored and supported by an open community of developers. It is also supported by NumFOCUS, a community foundation for supporting reproducible and accessible science.

==Components==
The SciPy package is at the core of Python&#x27;s scientific computing capabilities. Available sub-packages include:
* cluster: hierarchical clustering, vector quantization, K-means
*constants: physical constants and conversion factors
* fft: Discrete Fourier Transform algorithms
* fftpack: Legacy interface for Discrete Fourier Transforms
* integrate: numerical integration routines
* interpolate: interpolation tools
* io: data input and output
* linalg: linear algebra routines
* misc: miscellaneous utilities (e.g. example images)
* ndimage: various functions for multi-dimensional image processing
*ODR: orthogonal distance regression classes and algorithms
* optimize: optimization algorithms including linear programming
* signal: signal processing tools
* sparse: sparse matrices and related algorithms
* spatial: algorithms for spatial structures such as k-d trees, nearest neighbors, convex hulls, etc.
* special: special functions
* stats: statistical functions
* weave: tool for writing C/C++ code as Python multiline strings (now deprecated in favor of Cython)
==Data structures==
The basic data structure used by SciPy is a multidimensional array provided by the NumPy module. NumPy provides some functions for linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation, but not with the generality of the equivalent functions in SciPy. NumPy can also be used as an efficient multidimensional container of data with arbitrary datatypes. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases. Older versions of SciPy used Numeric as an array type, which is now deprecated in favor of the newer NumPy array code.

==History==
In the 1990s, Python was extended to include an array type for numerical computing called Numeric. (This package was eventually replaced by NumPy, which was written by Travis Oliphant in 2006 as a blending of Numeric and Numarray, with Numarray itself being started in 2001.) As of 2000, there was a growing number of extension modules and increasing interest in creating a complete environment for scientific and technical computing. In 2001, Travis Oliphant, Eric Jones, and Pearu Peterson merged code they had written and called the resulting package SciPy. The newly created package provided a standard collection of common numerical operations on top of the Numeric array data structure. Shortly thereafter, Fernando Pérez released IPython, an enhanced interactive shell widely used in the technical computing community, and John Hunter released the first version of Matplotlib, the 2D plotting library for technical computing. Since then the SciPy environment has continued to grow with more packages and tools for technical computing.

== Scientific Python versus ScientificPython ==
In the scientific literature, SciPy is occasionally referred to as &quot;Scientific Python (SciPy)&quot;. This is incorrect: the official name of the project is just &quot;SciPy&quot;.

Furthermore, expanding &quot;SciPy&quot; as &quot;Scientific Python&quot; may cause confusion with &quot;ScientificPython&quot;, a project led by Konrad Hinsen of Orléans University that was active between 1995 and 2014.

&quot;Scientific Python&quot; is also used for the related ecosystem of tools.

<text>Peter Reid (born 20 June 1956) is an English football manager, pundit and former player.

A defensive midfielder in his playing days, Reid enjoyed a long and successful career. He built his reputation as one of England&#x27;s brightest midfield talents of the time at Bolton Wanderers, before signing for Everton in 1982. It was there that he enjoyed the most fruitful spell of his career, as he helped the club win domestic and European honours, including the English Football League twice. He was voted as the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year in 1985 and came fourth in the World Soccer Player of the Year award, behind Michel Platini, Preben Elkjær and Diego Maradona. He also received his first senior England call-up that year, and represented his country at the 1986 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 1988. He won 13 caps in total. Reid joined Queens Park Rangers in 1989, but moved on to Manchester City a year later to begin his managerial career.

He spent three years at Maine Road as player-manager, and guided them to two fifth-place finishes in the First Division, the first of which saw them finish above their city rivals Manchester United. He was persuaded to resume his playing career after leaving Manchester City, and briefly played for Southampton, Notts County and Bury before returning to management with Sunderland in 1995. He won promotion to the Premier League with the club on two occasions and achieved two seventh-place finishes in the top division. He combined his role at the Stadium of Light with the job as manager of the England U21 for a brief spell in 1999. His seven-year association with Sunderland ended in 2002 and he returned to management a year later, helping Leeds United avoid relegation from the Premier League. Reid left Elland Road the following season.

He was appointed manager of Coventry City in 2004 but his tenure lasted less than a year. He then worked as a pundit for the BBC at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and also worked for Sky Sports and ESPN before returning to management with Thailand in 2008. He won the T&amp;T Cup with the country before returning to England as assistant manager to Tony Pulis at Stoke City, and helped them to an eleventh-place finish in the Premier League. He then managed Plymouth Argyle, taking over in June 2010, but was sacked after just over a year at the Devon club.

==Playing career==

=== Club career ===
Reid signed professional forms with Bolton Wanderers in 1974. He first won a medal when Bolton won the championship of the Football League Second Division in 1978, but he only enjoyed two seasons of First Division football before Bolton were relegated.

The boyhood Liverpool fan transferred to rivals Everton in 1982, for £60,000 in 1982 only 12 months after a much larger fee had been mooted – a succession of injuries had cut the price.

At club level his greatest achievement was as part of the Everton team that in 1984 won the FA Cup, in 1985 and 1987 the Football League First Division and in 1985 the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. They nearly won a unique treble but lost 1–0 to Manchester United in the 1985 FA Cup final. In that game, Reid was recklessly challenged by Manchester United defender Kevin Moran who became the first player to be sent off in an FA Cup final.

He was voted PFA Footballer of the Year in 1985, the same year that he collected a Football League title and European Cup Winner&#x27;s Cup winner&#x27;s medal. Reid&#x27;s form was so good that year, he came 4th in the World Soccer player of the year award behind only Michel Platini, Preben Elkjaer and Diego Maradona.

He made 167 appearances (eight as substitute) for Everton. In 2006, Reid was awarded with the &#x27;Everton Giant&#x27; accolade.

Reid signed for Queens Park Rangers on a free transfer in February 1989, but only stayed until December, when he signed for Manchester City, then managed by former Everton manager Howard Kendall.

Following his dismissal by Manchester City, in October 1993 Reid was persuaded by Ian Branfoot to resume his playing career with Southampton who were then in the middle of a crisis: the Saints fans were calling for Branfoot to be sacked with the club having lost eight of their first nine games. Reid brought a touch of guile and stability to the Saints side; despite playing only eight games he made a major contribution to the team&#x27;s fortunes as Saints&#x27; season started to come together. He led them to some important victories, most specially over Newcastle United on 24 October 1993, a game in which Matt Le Tissier scored two goals. His final game for Saints was a 3–1 victory over Chelsea on 28 December 1993.

Branfoot was sacked a few days later (after a home defeat by Norwich City). Reid was touted as a possible replacement for Branfoot, but he stated that, as Branfoot had brought him to the club, it would only be fair that he left as well. Reid then had brief playing spells with Notts County and Bury before he retired from playing.

=== International career ===
Reid won 13 caps for England. Given his chance by the injuries to other players, he became the linchpin of the England team in the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico. In the England v Argentina quarter-final at that tournament Reid was one of the England players left behind by Diego Maradona as he burst from inside his own half to score his &#x27;Goal of the Century&#x27; second goal.

==Managerial career==
===Manchester City===
Reid&#x27;s managerial career began on 7 November 1990 at Manchester City, when he was appointed caretaker manager after the departure of Howard Kendall back to Everton. Reid was appointed player-manager on a permanent contract on 15 November.

In 1990–91, Manchester City finished fifth (one place above neighbours Manchester United) and equalled this achievement the following season. In the first season of the Premier League (1992–93), City slipped into ninth place with an increasingly stale brand of &#x27;long ball&#x27; football and Reid was sacked after a poor start to the following season.

Reid bought Keith Curle and Terry Phelan for £2.5 million each. Colin Hendry was sold to be eventually replaced by Michel Vonk. Clive Allen was also sold in December 1991.

===Sunderland===
Reid made his return to management in March 1995 with Sunderland, who were battling relegation in the First Division. He kept the club up, and the following season they were crowned champions of the division and were promoted to the Premier League. 

In 1996, a group of Sunderland fans under the name Simply Red and White released a song called &quot;Daydream Believer (Cheer Up Peter Reid)&quot; to the melody of &quot;Daydream Believer&quot;. The song peaked at number 41 in the UK Singles &amp; Album Chart. The fans recorded the song due to the fact the manager often had a dour demeanour, whilst the team was doing well, and even won promotion at the end of the season.

The team was relegated back to the First Division at the end of the 1996–97 season, after losing their last match of the campaign at Wimbledon.

Sunderland missed automatic promotion by one place in 1997–98 but reached the Division One play-off final, facing Charlton Athletic at Wembley Stadium. Reid&#x27;s side missed out on promotion after drawing 3-3 after 90 minutes, 4-4 after extra time and losing 7–6 in a penalty shoot-out in one of the most dramatic play-off finals to date. The following season Sunderland bounced back by winning the Division One title with a then record 105 League points total. They topped the First Division table from October until the end of the season and clinched promotion on 13 April 1999 with a 5–2 win over Bury.

Throughout 1999–2000, Sunderland were competing for a place in European competition but in the end missed out after finishing in seventh place, one of the highest finishes ever achieved by a Premier League team in the season after promotion. Striker Kevin Phillips was the highest league scorer in England and Europe with 30 goals in the Premier League, and therefore won the European Golden Shoe that season; he was the last Englishman to win the accolade until 2024, when Harry Kane claimed the award after his 36-goal Bundesliga campaign. Reid also had a brief spell as manager of the England under-21 team in this season. For a while in 2000–01, Sunderland were second in the league and it looked as though they would secure qualification for the UEFA Champions League, but their form dipped in the final stages of the season and again they finished seventh.

Reid&#x27;s team suffered a downturn in the 2001–02 season ending up one place above the relegation zone and with just 28 goals from 38 games – fewer than any other team in the division. In a bid to halt the decline, Reid paid a club record £6.75million for Norwegian striker Tore André Flo from Rangers but was unsuccessful. Reid was dismissed in October 2002 after nearly eight years as Sunderland manager.

===Leeds United===
Following his sacking from Sunderland, Reid was linked with the Republic of Ireland managerial position. He had even planned to apply for an Irish passport through his Drumcondra family connections. In March 2003 he was appointed caretaker manager of Leeds United after the dismissal of Terry Venables. The Elland Road club had been hit by £80 million debts after their £100 million outlay on new players in the space of five seasons had failed to land them a trophy. Reid looked to be the man to reverse the decline, especially after a 6–1 away win over Charlton Athletic and a 3–2 away win over Arsenal which ended the opposition&#x27;s title hopes. After keeping Leeds up, he was awarded the job on a permanent basis.

The club was still in a poor financial state, and Reid was forced to sell Harry Kewell and bring in cheaper signings from abroad as replacements. His new signings failed to gel and he was sacked in November 2003 after a 6–1 defeat against newly promoted Portsmouth. Although many of his signings left Leeds after the club was relegated, Kevin Blackwell, whom Reid had brought to Leeds as assistant manager, later went on to become manager in 2004.

===Coventry City===
Reid was appointed manager of First Division side Coventry City in May 2004 with the aim of getting the club promoted to the Premier League. His spell at Highfield Road lasted only eight months as he departed on 6 January 2005 with the club 20th in the Championship.

===Thailand national team===
After an absence from management of nearly four years Reid became manager of Thailand in September 2008, having been linked with the position earlier in the year. He signed a four-year contract with an aim of qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He admitted to not knowing much about Thai football, and referring to his players by squad numbers rather than their Thai names. Reid said &quot;I was surprised by the players&#x27; ability and I&#x27;m learning things about football I&#x27;d never have learnt in the Premier League. It&#x27;s great for my football education. This is pure football and I love it.&quot;

Reid&#x27;s first assignment as the new national coach of Thailand was to take part in the T&amp;T Cup in Vietnam, a three-team round-robin tournament with hosts Vietnam and North Korea. Thailand beat North Korea in the first game of the tournament and then went on to draw with Vietnam to clinch the championship. On 9 September 2009, the Thailand Football Association (FAT) announced that Reid had left his position as manager; his contract was terminated by mutual consent after a year in charge.

===Stoke City===
After Reid left the Thailand job on 10 September 2009, Reid joined Stoke City as assistant manager to Tony Pulis. Reid spent the 2009–10 season at Stoke before leaving in June 2010 in order to return to management.

===Plymouth Argyle===
On 24 June 2010, Plymouth Argyle confirmed the appointment of Reid as manager. Reid endured an unexpectedly turbulent time with the Pilgrims who had just been relegated from the Football League Championship. The club was hit with two winding-up petitions from HMRC in November, and was forced to sell star players Bradley Wright-Phillips and Craig Noone in the January transfer window. Reid himself even auctioned off his FA Cup runners up medal and paid the club&#x27;s heating bill at one point. Despite these efforts the club was docked 10 points for intention to enter administration in February 2011 and left Argyle bottom of League 1 with relegation seeming inevitable. The club&#x27;s relegation to League 2 was confirmed on 2 May 2011 following a 3–1 defeat to Southampton, with the club finishing 23rd in League One.

Reid was forced to sign an almost entirely new team over the summer of 2011, with 10 players making their debut on the opening day in a 1–1 draw with Shrewsbury Town. However the club were unable to build on the Shrewsbury result and lost their following 8 league games, all whilst the club was still stuck in financial turmoil. On 18 September, Peter Reid was sacked by acting chairman Peter Ridsdale with the club bottom of the Football League with just one point. Despite having a win rate of just 26% during his time at the club, Reid remains popular amongst Plymouth Argyle supporters because of his generosity and commitment during troubled times.

===Mumbai City FC===
On 4 September 2014, Reid was appointed manager of Mumbai City FC ahead of the inaugural Indian Super League season.

===Return to Bolton===
On 18 March 2016, it was announced that Reid had returned to his first club Bolton Wanderers in a coaching capacity to assist interim manager Jimmy Phillips. He left at the end of the season.

<doc id="263476" wikidata="Q848287" url="?curid=263476" title="Livingston, West Lothian">
<text>Livingston (, ) is the largest town in West Lothian, Scotland. Designated in 1962, it is the fourth post-war new town to be built in Scotland. Taking its name from a village of the same name incorporated into the new town, it was originally developed in the then-counties of Midlothian and West Lothian along the banks of the River Almond. It is situated approximately fifteen miles (25 km) west of Edinburgh and thirty miles (50 km) east of Glasgow, and is close to the towns of Broxburn to the north-east and Bathgate to the north-west.

The town was built around a collection of small villages, Livingston Village, Bellsquarry, and Livingston Station (now part of Deans). The town has a number of residential areas. These include Craigshill, Howden, Ladywell, Knightsridge, Deans, Dedridge, Murieston, Almondvale, Eliburn, Kirkton, and Adambrae. There are several large industrial estates in Livingston, including Houston industrial estate, Brucefield Industrial Estate, Alba Business Park, and Kirkton Campus. The locality of Livingston as defined by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS) includes Uphall Station and Pumpherston. The wider urban settlement, also defined by the GROS, further includes Mid Calder and East Calder. Other neighbouring villages include: Kirknewton, Polbeth and West Calder. The 2001 UK Census reported that the town had a population of 50,826. The 2011 UK Census showed the population of Livingston had increased to 56,269. Livingston is the second-largest settlement in the Lothians, after Edinburgh.

==History==

===Before 1962===
Livingston is first mentioned in an early 12th-century charter as &quot;Villa Levingi&quot; (Leving&#x27;s town). In 1128, David I granted the newly founded Abbey of Holyrood control of the church at Livingston and its income in a charter that was witnessed by &quot;Turstani filii Levingi&quot; (Thurstan son of Leving). He built a fortified tower (Livingston Peel) which no longer survives. The settlement that grew up around it became known as Levingstoun, Layingston, and eventually fixed at Livingston. The Leving family controlled the area until dying out in 1512. From 1512 until 1671 the tower house was occupied by the Murrays of Elibank. In 1670, the Edinburgh botanic garden was founded by Dr. Robert Sibbald and Dr. Andrew Balfour using the plant collection from the Elibank private gardens of Sir Patrick Murray, 2nd Lord Elibank, following his death in September 1671. In the late 17th century, the Peel was demolished and replaced by a house called Livingston Place. The estate eventually passed from the Murray family to the Cunningham family and it was eventually acquired by the Earl of Rosebery in 1828 and demolished in 1840. The area of the former gardens and house is now a local garden and park, named Peel park. The formal layout and planting in the park reflect the historic gardens, and a new peel mound and moat was recreated to reflect the earlier history.

The area around Livingston was historically an important shale oil area, and the world&#x27;s first oil boom occurred in West Lothian. This was based on oil extracted from shale, and by 1870 over 3 million tons of shale were being mined each year in the area around Livingston. Output declined with the discovery of liquid oil reserves around the world in the early 1900s, but shale mining only finally ceased in 1962. The &quot;bings&quot; that characterise oil shale mining in West Lothian have largely been flattened. Two shale bings nearby are scheduled monuments – Five Sisters and Greendykes.

By 1898, the main Livingston village was recorded as having several houses, a mill, a Church of Scotland church, a United Free church, a school, and a coaching inn. The oldest church, Livingston Old Kirk, in its current form, dates from 1732 and is an example of plain Presbetryrian architecture from the Georgian period. It stands on the site of a pre-Reformation church which appears to have stood on the site from . The nearby coaching inn was built in 1760 and the poet Robert Burns is said to have been a guest. The nearby Livingston Mill was also built around the same date, in 1770 although there is evidence that suggests there may have been a mill on the site since the 14th or 15th century. Around north of Livingston village, there was a railway station with a smaller settlement called Livingston Station which is now part of Deans. Livingston station was built as a settlement to serve the workforce and their families of the nearby Deans Oil Works, owned by the Pumpherston Oil Company. Livingston Station had six streets with homes, as well as a store, a small church and a works institute. The original Livingston railway station was operated by the Edinburgh and Bathgate Railway and opened on 12 November 1849. British Railways closed the station on 1 November 1948 following the ending of passenger services on the line. In the 1980s, a site was chosen for a new railway station on the line to the east of the original station and Livingston North station opened on 24 March 1986, concurrent with the re-introduction of passenger services. The Livingston Village and Livingston Station settlements were both subsequently incorporated into Livingston new town in the 20th century.

===New Town===
Under the New Towns Act of 1946, Livingston was designated as a New Town on 16 April 1962 in order to ease overcrowding in Glasgow. Livingston was the fourth new town of five in Scotland; the others were East Kilbride, Glenrothes, Cumbernauld and Irvine. Three villages (Livingston Village and Livingston Station in the old parish of Livingston and Bellsquarry in the parish of Mid Calder) and numerous farmsteads were incorporated into the Livingston new town. Published in July 1962, the first edition of the Livingston plan designated new areas for housing for up to 100,000 people, as well as areas for new industry and offices, marked by new roads, pathways, and recreational spaces, under an survey led by Professors Donald Robertson and Sir Robert Matthew. Many of the initial houses were factory-built. A subsequent edition to the plan was published in 1966 with Livingston intended as the centre of a new population area of up to 250,000 persons in the Lothians. The new town plan envisaged Livingston as a focal point for economic growth in the Lothian region, incorporating &#x27;overspill&#x27; population from Glasgow and Edinburgh. The design incorporated a vision of mixed development, connected by a new series of roads in a grid system by means of grade separated junctions and roundabouts. While the new town plan considered the car to be the principal form of transport, it also envisaged a series of core footpaths to connect communities under the Radburn design.

In order to build, manage, and promote Livingston, a quango organisation was formed, the Livingston Development Corporation (LDC). Sir David Lowe, a local large scale farmer and businessman, was appointed chairman. Following designation of the new town, the first large building begun was the Corporation&#x27;s own offices in 1963. Residential construction began in 1962 with the first homes to be built as part of the new town being constructed in Deans (to house corporation employees and construction workers). The first major development of the new town took place in Craigshill, with the first people moving into the newly built housing areas in April 1966 at Broom Walk. The construction of the areas of Howden, Ladywell, and Knightsridge began in the late 1960s and this was followed in the 1970s by the creation of Dedrige and further development of Deans. Some of the first prominent buildings in the new town built in these decades included Riverside Primary School (the first primary school built in the new town in April 1966), Livingston Fire Station (1967 by the architects Bamber &amp; Hall), the new town&#x27;s first public house (the Tower in Craigshill built in 1968), Craigshill school (the first secondary school built in the new town in 1969), and the &#x27;Centre&#x27; (Livingstons shopping centre) built in 1977. Craigshill was said to exemplify the spartan, geometric approach to new town planning, with buildings composed of the Danish style Jesperson blocks and high-density, low-rise concrete homes with Scandinavian style mono-pitch roofs.

By 1971, the town&#x27;s population had risen to 14,000. On 9 November 1979 the Livingston UFO Incident took place, when Robert Taylor, employed by the Livingston Development Corporation, is said to have encountered a UFO on Dechmont Law and the incident was subsequently investigated by Lothian and Borders Police. It is the only UFO incident that was part of a criminal investigation in the United Kingdom.

In 1984, a new railway station was built for the town on the Shotts Line called Livingston South which was shortly followed by another station Livingston North on the redeveloped Edinburgh to Bathgate Line in 1986. These stations replaced the former Livingston and Newpark stations which had closed before the construction of the town. In 1995 Livingston gained its professional football team, Livingston F.C. The first team was essentially formed from the relocation of Meadowbank Thistle F.C. from Edinburgh.

While in 1980, the LDC owned 90% of the town&#x27;s housing, by 1996 this had reduced to some 40% through sales and increasing private home ownership. The Livingston Development Corporation guided Livingston until its mandate expired on 22 March 1997 and the town was transferred to the West Lothian Council. The last major construction operation carried out by the LDC was the Almondvale Stadium. Housing development continues under West Lothian Council, through private developers such as Barratt Developments and Bellway, and under the management of housing associations such as the Almond Housing Association and the West Lothian Housing Partnership.

In September 2021, the town submitted a bid for city status in the United Kingdom as part of the Platinum Jubilee Civic Honours Competition. Although the town was not successful in being raised to city status, 2022 marked its 60th anniversary as a town.

== Geography ==

Livingston is the eighth-largest settlement and the third-largest town in Scotland. It is also the 171st largest settlement in the United Kingdom. It lies from Glasgow and from Edinburgh.

The Livingston new town was planned so that the River Almond, the namesake of the Almondvale district, runs through the town centre.

Outer Livingston districts include Wester Dechmont, Deans (including the Deans Industrial Estate), Kirkton, and Houston to the north, Craigshill to the east, Bellsquarry (including the Brucefield Industrial Estate) and Murieston to the south, and Adambrae and Kirkton Campus to the east of the town. Craigshill takes its name from the Scottish Gaelic word for the slopes of a hill.

Inner central districts in the town include Almondvale, Livingston Village, Eliburn, Howden, Ladywell, Knightsridge, and Dedridge. Ladywell takes its name from a historic well that was dedicated to Mary and was said to have been used by medieval Scottish Kings as a site for a yearly Royal touching ceremony.

The geology of Livingston is similar to that of West Lothian in general, characterised by former glacial history and composed of till. This includes areas of clay, sand, silt, and gravel, primarily along the Almond river valley environment. Parts of Livingston also have isolated areas of carboniferous sedimentary rocks (primarily in and around the Deans area of the town) which were worked and extracted for shale oil in the 19th and 20th centuries. The oldest rocks are classified as part of the Inverclyde Group (primarily located in the south-east of Livingston between Linhouse Water and Kirknewton). There are also several areas of underlying sandstone in Livingston which were used as local quarries, now since defunct, including Dedridge quarry, refilled and landscaped as a local park (Quarry Froggy Park). Bellsquarry originates from a former Burdiehouse limestone quarry and the surname of its owner, Mr Bell. The quarry was in operation by 1782 and continued until the early 20th century, when it was used as a rubbish dump before being tidied and covered.

Until the development of the new town, except for localised industry in areas such as Deans, the area was primarily agricultural, with farming focused on the alluvial soils of the Almond river. The area is now primarily an urban area although as a new town, Livingston is characterised by large areas of forested paths, public parks and open spaces. Forested areas in Livingston include Livingston Old Wood () in Eliburn, the Wilderness in Adambrae (), Bellsquarry Wood (), Kirkton Woods (), Linhouse Glen, and Calder Woods (on the boundary with East Calder).

== Economy ==

The area where Livingston now sits was historically dominated by oil shale mining, which is evident from the bings which still exist on much of the surrounding landscape. The designation of Livingston as a new town in the 1960s attracted new light industries to the area, with high technology and pharmaceutical companies moving into the town. Livingston formed a major hub in Scotland&#x27;s Silicon Glen with factories constructed in purpose-build business parks at Houston Industrial Estate and Kirkton Campus. Like most other areas, this went into a slow decline from the late 1990s with companies including Burroughs Corporation (now Unisys), Motorola and NEC closing down their factories. Several multi-national companies still have factories in the town, including Wyman Gordon who manufacture aircraft components on the Houston Industrial Estate. Other companies on the Houston Industrial Estate include Mitsubishi Electric (who have an electric air conditioning factory which produces almost 150,000 air conditioning and heat pump units every year), Paterson Arran (a food manufacturer whose bakery, the Royal Burgh Bakery is located in Livingston), and DS Smith (who have a box production plant on the estate).

From the 1970s, Kirkton Campus on the western edge of the town was developed as Scotland&#x27;s first technology science park. Developed for private businesses by the LDC, it included 300 acres of landscaped offices and factory sites along the Killandean Burn and River Almond. Former businesses included Ethicon, Boehringer Mannheim, Canon Business Machines and Seagate Micro Electronics. While these factories on the Campus have closed, it is still home to several businesses, including Sky UK who is one of the largest private sector employers in Livingston with a range of offices and their biggest UK contact centre at Kirkton Campus. Other companies at Kirkton Campus include Merck (a pharmaceutical company), Gore W L &amp; Associates (a clothes manufacturer in a triangular plan building built in 1984), Edinburgh Instruments (a molecular spectroscopy instrumentation manufacturer), SCION Instruments (a chromatography and gas detector manufacturer), Techcomp Lab Products (a manufacturer of laboratory instrumentation),JPT Foodtech, and Palletways (a distribution service which owns a hub facility).
Other large employers include Tesco (whose distribution centre for Scotland and Northern Ireland is located on the northern edge of the town), Schuh (whose head office and customer service centre is on the Deans Industrial Estate in Livingston), Shin-Etsu Europe (who have a manufacturing facility in Livingston that produces semiconductors), those in the retail sector in the shopping centres, supermarkets, and the health care sector such as NHS Scotland. The Witherby Publishing Group, established in 1740, is one of the oldest publishers in the United Kingdom and their offices and warehouse is located in Livingston at Navigation House. Valneva SE is a biotech company that has a manufacturing facility in Livingston which produces vaccines, including a vaccine against COVID-19.

The Brucefield Industrial Estate is located west of Bellsquarry and includes companies such as Diet Chef (a food manufacturer), ScoMac (a catering equipment manufacturer), and Snag Tights (a textile manufacturer based in Livingston that exports to 90 countries).

Alba Business Park is located in Livingston to the west of Adambrae and includes a technology innovation centre. Companies in the Alba Business Park include Glenmorangie, the whisky distillers, who have offices and a bottling facility that was opened in 2011. Quintiles IMS, a healthcare data provider, have a large office in the business park. The prosthetic company Össur (Touch Bionics) has a research and development facility in the park.

== Town centre ==

Livingston town centre sits on the southern edge of the Almond Valley and provides shops and services for the surrounding area. It is bounded by a ring road to the east and has been purposely planned, distinguishing it from many other town centres. Howden Park is located immediately north of the town centre and adjoins Howden House, an 18th-century house which contains an arts centre and private housing. The south western edge of the town centre is dominated by retail parks. Livingston&#x27;s town centre also contains a large number of offices. Private sector offices are also concentrated at the eastern and western edges of the town centre and along the Almondvale Boulevard. Other facilities in the town centre include: hotels, a swimming pool and local authority gym, and restaurants and pubs. Almondvale Football Stadium and West Lothian College are located at the north western edge of the town centre.

The Livingston Civic Centre was completed in June 2009 and officially opened by then-First Minister Alex Salmond on 25 November 2009. The Civic Centre is located just north of The Centre on the bank of the River Almond. It was home to the divisional headquarters of Lothian and Borders Police until the creation of Police Scotland in 2013, as well as the sheriff and justice of the peace, West Lothian Council, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, the Scottish Children&#x27;s Reporter Administration, Lothian and Borders Fire and Rescue Service, and the West Lothian Community Health and Care Partnership.

== Shopping ==
Livingston has three major shopping centres, three medium large retail parks, and clusters of small local stores located throughout the different areas. The largest shopping centres are &#x27;The Centre&#x27; (formerly named the Almondvale Shopping Centre, comprising more than of retail space) and Livingston Designer Outlet (the largest outlet mall in Scotland, formerly called the McArthurGlen Designer Outlet Centre). The combined retail spaces of central Livingston form the largest indoor shopping location in Scotland and the 10th largest in the UK.

The first phase of the Livingston&#x27;s shopping centres was completed in 1977 to facilitate the needs of the local residents and workers at The Centre, known as the &quot;Livingston Centre&quot; at that point. The first major refurbishment was completed in 1988 by Land Securities. The centre was extended by in 1996/1997, creating phase 2 of the development, bringing the size of the centre to over . It has since been renamed &quot;The Almondvale Centre&quot;. The Centre was completed in its current structure on 16 October 2008. The total development has around 155 shops and eating establishments. In early 1999, construction started on phase 3 of the development with the construction of McArthur Glen Designer Outlet Centre (reamed as the Livingston Designer Outlet in 2007). This opened in October 2000, with other work continuing into 2002. The Livingston Designer Outlet, contains a VUE multiplex cinema, a food court with many chain fast-food outlets, bars, restaurants, and cafés, as well as around 70 outlet shops. In the early 2000s, Asda constructed a new supercentre at the other end of the shopping centre in place of the old Woolco store (which had also been used as a Gateway hypermarket before Asda acquired the firm in late-1989). This Asda supercentre is the largest Asda store in Scotland.

Until 2016, there was also a large B&amp;Q in the south-west of the town centre, as well as a large Morrisons supermarket which remains open. The Homebase store closed in July 2010 and Argos moved to premises across the road. The former Homebase and Argos stores were converted into a large Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket that opened in December 2010. Also in the town centre are discount supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl, the latter of which is located beside the Almondvale Stadium.

Under the original Livingston plans, neighbourhood shopping centres were to be located at strategic points around the town and the first of these to be built was The Mall at Craigshill, which claimed to be one of the first covered shopping centres in Scotland. This was followed by the Carmondean Centre in Deans and groupings of shops in Ladywell and Murieston.

Livingston F.C., known to locals as &quot;&quot;Livi&quot; or &quot;The Lions&quot;&quot;, are the most notable football team in the town. They were formed in 1995 on the relocation of Edinburgh-based side Meadowbank Thistle. The stadium opened in November 1995, but the Livingston name had already been adopted some months earlier when the club was still playing at its former home Meadowbank Stadium in Edinburgh.

Although they were playing in the Scottish Third Division in their first season in Livingston, six years later the club was promoted to the Scottish Premier League, finished third in their first season and qualifying for the UEFA Cup. Relegation to the Scottish First Division in 2006 came after the club entered administration in 2004 as well as other financial problems. In 2009 they narrowly avoided going out of business and as a result were placed back in the Third Division.

The Lions managed to gain promotion to the Scottish Second Division the following year, and returned to the First Division after back to back league championships, on 6 August 2011. They currently compete in the second tier of Scottish Football (Scottish Championship).

=== Livingston Cricket Club ===
Livingston has a cricket club known as the Kingfishers which fields teams for juniors and seniors and has fielded professional paid players. The club plays in the East of Scotland Cricket Association and is based in the Murieston area of Livingston. The club was founded in 1981 by Dr Salem Patel and Doug Druce, playing its first match in August of that year in Armadale. The club joined the East League for the 1982 season, winning Grade D and promotion. The club played at several locations in Livingston, including Bankton Mains and at Bangour Hospital sports field. The 1st XI remained in Division 4 until winning the league in 1992. In 1994 sponsorship by the Livingston Development Corporation enabled the club to successfully negotiate the big step up to Division 2 where half of the clubs employed paid professional players. West Indian Mark Harper became the club&#x27;s first paid player and regularly set new batting records throughout the season. The creation of the National leagues in 1996 and the subsequent re-organisation of feeder leagues saw Livingston become a Division 1 club due to reconstruction of the East League. In 1999 the club finished third, their highest league position to date. This coincided with a move back into Livingston to a large new ground in the Murieston area. Being almost in the foothills of the Pentlands, rainfall is heavier and the growing season considerably shorter than most of the other grounds in the Central Belt, which causes major problems in getting the ground ready for play in April. A new pavilion, the Gerry Toms Pavilion was officially opened on 22 August 2004.

<doc id="263478" wikidata="Q3526029" url="?curid=263478" title="Jim Laker">
<text>James Charles Laker (9 February 1922 – 23 April 1986) was an English professional cricketer who played for Surrey County Cricket Club from 1946 to 1959 and represented England in 46 Test matches. He was born in Shipley, West Riding of Yorkshire, and died in Wimbledon, London.

A right-arm off break bowler, Laker is generally regarded as one of the greatest spin bowlers in cricket history. In 1956, he achieved a still-unequalled world record when he took nineteen (of a maximum twenty) wickets in a Test match at Old Trafford Cricket Ground in Manchester, enabling England to defeat Australia in what has become known as &quot;Laker&#x27;s Match&quot;. At club level, he formed a formidable spin partnership with Tony Lock, who was a left-arm orthodox spinner, and they played a key part in the success of the Surrey team through the 1950s including seven consecutive County Championship titles from 1952 to 1958. Laker batted right-handed as a useful tail-ender who scored two first-class centuries. He was considered a good fielder, especially in the gully position.

For his achievements in 1951, Laker was selected by &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; (Wisden) as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in its 1952 edition. He was selected as the &quot;New Zealand Cricket Almanack&quot; Player of the Year in 1952 after playing for Auckland in the 1951–52 season. In 1956, his Surrey benefit season realised £11,086 (£ in 2021 terms) and, at the end of that year, he was voted &quot;BBC Sports Personality of the Year&quot;, the first cricketer to win the award. He later worked for BBC Sport as a cricket commentator in its outside broadcast transmissions.

==Early life and school years==
Jim Laker was born on 9 February 1922 in Shipley, near Bradford, which was then in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He was raised by his mother Ellen Kane, a schoolteacher, and had four sisters. His father, a stonemason called Charles Laker, had deserted the family when Jim was two years old. Laker began playing cricket at a very early age. His mother was a lifelong enthusiast of the game, and, throughout his childhood, he played cricket continuously with her full encouragement. She used to make his sisters bowl to him because she was convinced he had the makings of a batsman.

In the years around 1930, Ellen was employed at Frizinghall Council School in Bradford, which Laker attended until 1932. He won a grammar school scholarship which entitled him to a free place at the Salts High School in nearby Saltaire. About that time, Ellen took up with a new partner called Bert Jordan and the family moved to Baildon, which is near Saltaire. This was a sound relationship, and Laker was able to enjoy a settled home life through his senior school years from September 1932 for seven years. He said later that he was very happy at Salts and he became a regular member of the school cricket team, playing primarily as a batsman but also as a fast bowler.

In March 1938, aged 16, Laker was invited to attend special coaching by Yorkshire County Cricket Club in their winter shed at Headingley. He recalled his mother taking him to buy new cricket gear at Herbert Sutcliffe&#x27;s shop in Leeds. He said the sacrifice she made was &quot;frightening to contemplate&quot; but she was determined to see him succeed as a cricketer. Yorkshire&#x27;s coaching sessions were run by the former county batsman Benny Wilson, who was the first to show Laker how to spin the ball and encourage him to develop the skill. Although Wilson ran the teenage coaching classes, Laker was also coached by former Yorkshire players George Hirst, Maurice Leyland, Emmott Robinson and Alfred Wormald.

Yorkshire recommended him to join Saltaire Cricket Club, who played in the Bradford League, and he made his debut for them at their Roberts Park ground against Baildon, his local club. He played for Saltaire for three seasons, from 1938 to 1940, on one occasion scoring a century. In the 1938 season, his last at school, he played for Salts HS on Saturday morning and for Saltaire CC in the afternoon. Laker still thought of himself as a batsman and his contemporary Ronnie Burnet, who became Yorkshire&#x27;s captain in the late 1950s, recalled that Laker bowled a mixed bag of &quot;fast off-cutters-cum-spinners&quot; before the Second World War. Charlie Lee, one of Laker&#x27;s Saltaire team-mates, had a similar recollection saying that &quot;Jim bowled all sorts of stuff and generally enjoyed himself without ever appearing to have the makings of a great bowler&quot;.

==Army service and move to Surrey==
Laker left school in February 1939 and obtained full-time employment at Barclays Bank in Bradford city centre, working a nine-hour day for £5 a month (£ in 2021 terms). In early 1941, now aged 19, he volunteered for active service and joined the Army. He went to Leicestershire for infantry training and was then posted to the Royal Army Ordnance Corps (RAOC), serving in Palestine and Cairo until 1945, although he was never involved in front line fighting.

While Laker had done enough at Saltaire to be well remembered there, his cricketing career really gathered pace and took off while he was with the RAOC in Egypt. Playing on coconut matting wickets in inter-service matches, he decided to develop the off spin technique he had been taught by Benny Wilson. He recalled that, &quot;to my utter amazement&quot;, he could turn the ball &quot;quite prodigiously&quot; on the matting strips. John Arlott later wrote that English cricketers in Egypt were writing home and talking about &quot;a Yorkshire lad who could bowl off spin like a master&quot;. In 1943, Laker went to Alexandria to play for the RAOC against an RAF team and took five wickets for ten runs including a hat-trick. In 1944, he played against a South African Air Force XI, scored a century and then took six wickets for ten runs. In these matches, he encountered several top-class players including Norman Yardley, Peter Smith, Bert Sutcliffe, Ron Aspinall, Dudley Nourse and Arthur McIntyre.

Laker returned to England on leave in early 1945. Soon afterwards, his mother died of a heart attack. She left him an estate worth £1,000, which was fairly substantial at the time (£ in 2021 terms). Bert Jordan had died during the war and, all his sisters having married and moved on, his northern roots were broken and he no longer had any pressing reason to return to Bradford. He was able to keep his options open when his military service ended. He had to return to Egypt but was then repatriated in summer 1945 with a year of service still to perform before demobilisation. He was posted to the War Office itself in central London and was invited by an army friend called Colin Harris to lodge with his family in Forest Hill, a couple of miles from Catford. This was meant to be a temporary arrangement but Laker ended up living with the Harris family for over five years, until he was due to get married himself.

Despite being on Yorkshire&#x27;s books, Laker&#x27;s circumstances after the end of the war led almost inevitably to his being approached by Surrey County Cricket Club. While he was resident with the Harrises at Forest Hill, he continued to play for service teams and, in March 1946, he joined Catford Cricket Club. Some impressive performances for Catford, including ten for 21 against Bromley, were noted by Andrew Kempton, Catford&#x27;s club president, who was a member of the county club. Kempton knew Andy Sandham, the former England opening batsman who was Surrey&#x27;s coach in 1946, and recommended Laker. Sandham invited Laker for a trial at The Oval. Soon afterwards, on 17 July, Laker made his first-class debut when Surrey hosted a Combined Services XI, whom they defeated by six wickets. Laker had the creditable figures of three for 78 and three for 43. He was still in the RAOC but was demobilised in August.

One of his options was a permanent career in the Regular Army, perhaps even a commission. He considered a return to banking and asked Barclays if they would reinstate him and transfer him to a London branch. They agreed but, as Fred Robinson, one of Laker&#x27;s old school friends, later told biographer Alan Hill, &quot;neither of those ventures ever really came within his considerations&quot;. As soon as Laker was demobbed, Surrey offered him a professional contract, subject to Yorkshire&#x27;s approval. Yorkshire agreed to his release and he signed for Surrey on terms of £6 a week in winter (£ in 2021 terms), augmented by match fees in summer. Laker played in two more first-class matches at the end of the 1946 season. Only seventeen months later, in January 1948, he made his Test debut for England at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados.

==First-class and international career==
===1947 season and first international tour===
Laker bowled well at county level in 1947, taking 79 wickets and topping the Surrey bowling averages. His best performances were at Portsmouth, where he dismissed Hampshire with eight for 69, and at Chelmsford, where he took seven for 94 against Essex. Near the end of the season, he was invited to play for Pelham Warner&#x27;s XI against the South of England in a Hastings Festival match. Whether he knew it or not at the time, this match was effectively a Test trial. He took eight wickets in the match, including a second innings hat-trick. In its 1948 edition, &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; (Wisden) said that the discovery of Laker was &quot;very satisfactory&quot; for Surrey. He was described as specialising in off breaks, &quot;fielding smartly&quot; in the gully and showing promise as a batsman.

Soon afterwards, he was selected by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) for their 1947–48 tour of the West Indies. He played in four Tests and, on debut, took seven for 103 in the first innings of the first Test. This tour was a disaster for MCC and the inaugural 1948 edition of &quot;Playfair Cricket Annual&quot; (Playfair) headlined it as &quot;An Ill-Starred Venture&quot;. Planning and preparation were poor and the team was badly led by Gubby Allen. Playfair said Laker was the only player who &quot;really justified his selection&quot;. Wisden said Laker &quot;excelled&quot; and was &quot;undoubtedly the find of the tour&quot;, despite problems with an abdominal injury.

===1948 season===
Playing for Surrey in 1948, Laker took 79 wickets and the team were runners-up in the County Championship behind first-time winners Glamorgan. Still inexperienced at Test level, however, he came in for some heavy punishment when he played in three Tests against the 1948 Australians, an outstanding team that was unbeaten in the whole tour. Laker took nine wickets in the three matches but at a cost of 472 runs and the very high average of 52.44 runs per wicket – in comparison, his full Test career average was an outstanding 21.24.

England&#x27;s worst performance in the 1948 series was at Headingley where they actually played well for the first four days and set Australia a seemingly impossible last day target of 404 to win. Australia, led by Don Bradman, won by seven wickets. Godfrey Evans said the England team was complacent because no one had ever achieved such a target before in Test cricket. Evans himself was a prime culprit because he missed stumping chances, including one off Laker with Bradman beaten and out of his ground. Bradman later said that it was the key moment of the Australian innings. In the match as a whole, Laker bowled 62 overs and took three wickets for 206 runs. The situation was well summarised by Playfair saying that England needed &quot;a leg-spinner or a Verity&quot; (Hedley Verity was a slow left arm orthodox bowler) but they had neither. The implication was that the pitch was not one on which an off-break bowler such as Laker could succeed. Playfair went on to criticise &quot;tactical errors, missed chances and a sad lethargy in the field&quot;.

After the Headingley match, Laker was omitted from England&#x27;s team in the final Test at The Oval, his home ground, and he was not included in the squad for the tour of South Africa in 1948–49. Despite his continuing success for Surrey, he could not afterwards find a regular place in the England team until 1956 and went on only one international tour, to the West Indies again in 1953–54, between those in 1947–48 and 1956–57.

Alan Hill recorded that, while Laker may not have enjoyed the Headingley Test, its host club were very concerned indeed that Yorkshire-born Laker had eluded their attention. Fred Trueman later recalled that the Yorkshire club president Ernest Holdsworth contacted Laker in 1948 and invited him to dinner at a London restaurant. Laker accepted but was then astonished when Holdsworth tried to persuade him to return and play for Yorkshire. Although Laker did not like the social divide in place at Surrey, he wished to stay with his adopted county and thanked Holdsworth for the offer, which he declined. Len Hutton recalled that, also in 1948, he was asked by the Yorkshire committee to make some discreet enquiries about Laker&#x27;s situation in Surrey. He reported back that Laker was content where he was and did not wish to play for Yorkshire. Hutton agreed that Yorkshire &quot;went on needing Laker badly&quot; and ruefully admitted that he &quot;tied us in all sorts of knots&quot; in Yorkshire&#x27;s matches against Surrey.

===1949 to 1950–51===
In 1949, Laker played in only one of the four Tests against New Zealand even though he took 122 wickets in the season. In this series, England chose Eric Hollies, a leg spinner, in all the matches and Laker&#x27;s only selection was in the final Test at The Oval when he replaced Les Jackson, a pace bowler, as an extra spinner for the venue. The match was drawn and Laker, bowling well, took 4/78 in New Zealand&#x27;s second innings. England had no overseas tour in the winter of 1949–50.

In 1950, Laker took eight wickets for only two runs in an innings in a Test trial at Bradford Park Avenue when playing for England against &quot;The Rest&quot;. The match, scheduled for three days, began on Wednesday, 31 May with a chill wind blowing. The wicket had been uncovered and was drying after recent rain, which meant that a spinning delivery would act unpredictably when pitched. Laker took full advantage. He set an attacking leg side field and bowled around the wicket, concentrating on line and length with minimal flight, which gave the batsmen no time to come forward to the pitch of the ball. Some balls would gain extra bite from the pitch surface and rear up while others would &quot;turn&quot; to an unexpected degree. The Rest were all out before lunch for only 27. Batting conditions improved afterwards and England went on to win by an innings inside two days. As a Test trial, the match was of no use to the selectors and it was argued afterwards that the pitch should have been covered or, failing that, the England team should have batted first. One certainty that the match ensured was that Laker would play in the first Test that summer against the West Indies. Unfortunately, Laker injured his hand when batting in the Test, which impaired his bowling. He took only one wicket in the match, which England won, and the selectors decided to leave him out of the team thereafter. Without him, England lost the series one to three.

Although Laker took 166 wickets in 1950, his highest-ever season tally, the selectors continued to ignore him when they chose their squad to tour Australia in 1950–51 and so he accepted an invitation to tour India and Ceylon with a Commonwealth XI, playing in ten matches and taking 36 wickets. The Commonwealth squad was a multi-talented group considered stronger than the England one touring Australia. It was nominally captained by Les Ames but, because of injuries, he handed over to Frank Worrell. The Commonwealth XI were undefeated in 29 matches played between 1 October and 6 March, including four unofficial &quot;tests&quot; against India and one against Ceylon. Laker had to return home in early December because of sinusitis but he enjoyed the tour. He later recalled one incident when a huge rat ran across the field and onto the pitch just as he was about to bowl. Laker stopped and was then astonished to see a kite hawk swoop down, seize the rat in its talons and fly away with it. Laker was used to pigeons on the field at The Oval and he was so surprised by this that, when he did bowl the next ball, it bounced twice and was struck to the boundary.

===1951 to 1955===
After his recovery from sinusitis, Laker got married just before the 1951 season. He took 149 wickets that season and played in two of the five Tests against South Africa. In the final Test at The Oval, he took ten wickets in the match for 119 runs and England won by four wickets.

Laker went to New Zealand in the winter of 1951–52 as a player-coach for Auckland, taking his wife with him for what was effectively an extended honeymoon. He played in four matches for Auckland, taking 24 wickets. The Lakers were in New Zealand for five months and liked it so much that they seriously considered emigrating there. Laker decided that, on balance, his cricketing future was in England and regretfully declined an offer from the Auckland Cricket Association to re-engage as player-coach in 1952–53.

In 1952, the season in which Surrey won the first of their seven consecutive County Championship titles, Laker played in four Tests against India. In 1953, he played in three Tests against Australia, including the series decider at The Oval in which England won The Ashes for the first time in twenty years. He toured the West Indies again with MCC in 1953–54, playing in seven matches including four Tests and taking 22 wickets. He played in one Test against Pakistan in 1954 but was not chosen for the 1954–55 tour of Australia. He played in one Test against South Africa in 1955.

===1956===

Laker finally secured his Test place in 1956 and took part in all five Tests against Australia. He took all ten wickets in an innings for Surrey against the Australians. This was the first time a bowler had taken all ten against the Australians since Ted Barratt in 1878. Laker took 46 wickets in the 1956 Ashes series to establish a still-unbroken record for a five-match Test series between England and Australia, but Sydney Barnes still holds the world record of 49 wickets taken in 1913–14 for England in South Africa. Laker&#x27;s effort led to him being awarded the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award in 1956, the first cricketer to win the award. Surrey won the County Championship for the fifth consecutive time in 1956. Roy Webber&#x27;s history of the competition was published soon afterwards and, in his review of the contemporary county teams, he wrote that &quot;it is difficult to imagine a better and more balanced bowling attack than that presented by Alec Bedser, Peter Loader, Stuart Surridge, Jim Laker and Tony Lock&quot;.

====&quot;Laker&#x27;s Match&quot;====
In its report of the fourth Test at Old Trafford, Wisden began by saying that &quot;this memorable game will always be known as Laker&#x27;s Match because of the remarkable performance by the Surrey off-break bowler in taking nine wickets for 37 runs in the first innings and ten wickets for 53 in the second&quot;. The match took place from Thursday, 26 to Tuesday, 31 July. England, who had won the toss and decided to bat first, won the match by an innings and 170 runs.

England batted until mid-afternoon on the Friday and amassed a total of 459, which included centuries by Peter Richardson and David Sheppard. In reply, Australia were dismissed for 84 and, following on, reached 53 for one at the close. In Australia&#x27;s first innings, England&#x27;s two pace bowlers, Trevor Bailey and Brian Statham, bowled only ten overs between them before Laker and Lock were introduced. Laker began from the Warwick Road End but did not take a wicket until he switched to the Stretford End. Before tea, when Australia were 62 for two, he dismissed opener Colin McDonald, who was caught by Lock for 32, and Neil Harvey, who was bowled without scoring. Lock took the wicket of Jim Burke, caught by Colin Cowdrey at slip, with the first ball bowled after tea and England dominated from then on. In only 37 minutes from the restart, Australia collapsed to 84 all out. Laker terminated the innings by taking the last seven wickets for only eight runs in just 22 deliveries. His figures were nine for 37 while Lock&#x27;s were one for 37.

Australia were asked to follow-on and had reached 28 for no wicket when McDonald suffered a knee injury which forced him to retire hurt. Harvey replaced him and was out first ball after hitting Laker to Cowdrey at short mid-on. Australia&#x27;s best batsman had collected a &quot;pair&quot; and, despairingly, threw his bat into the air as he departed. Burke and Ian Craig put up some resistance and were still together at the close. According to Wisden, the Australians made a protest about the pitch on Friday evening and accused the hosts, Lancashire County Cricket Club, of preparing a pitch suited to spin bowling. Lancashire strongly denied the charge. Australian captain Ian Johnson made no public comment about the issue.

It then seemed as if the match was doomed to be ruined by the weather as only 47 minutes of play were possible on the Saturday and only an hour on the Monday. During that time, Australia lost Burke to Laker and reached 84 for two with McDonald (who returned when Burke was out) and Craig batting. On Tuesday, the final day, conditions improved and play began only ten minutes late. McDonald did his best and put up a strong defence, eventually scoring 89. Craig, who made 38, stayed with him until lunch when the score was 112 for two. The morning had been cloudy and the sun began to shine as lunch was taken. This caused the ball to spin quickly and create increased problems for the batsmen. During the afternoon session, Laker took four wickets in nine overs for three runs but then Richie Benaud joined McDonald and they stayed together for 75 minutes to the tea interval. The pitch was taking prodigious spin after tea and Australia&#x27;s hopes faded when Laker dismissed McDonald with the second ball of the evening session. At 17:27, with just over an hour to go, Laker bowled to Len Maddocks and appealed for leg before wicket. Maddocks was given out and Laker had taken all ten wickets for 53 runs to give England victory.

Wisden pointed out that the rain returned on Tuesday night and, on the Wednesday, the entire first-class programme was washed out. Wisden commented that &quot;it can be seen how close was England&#x27;s time margin, and how the greatest bowling feat of all time nearly did not happen&quot;. Writing in 2005, Richie Benaud recalled that there was rain in the Old Trafford area on the final day itself but it did not fall at the venue. Benaud was so impressed by Laker that he decided to shorten his own run-up and, he said, &quot;my bowling attitude&quot;. In its match report, Playfair said that Laker &quot;had enjoyed one of the most remarkable bowling performances that has ever been seen on a cricket field&quot;. The 1957 edition of Wisden included an article by Neville Cardus that paid tribute to Laker&#x27;s performances in 1956.

Laker&#x27;s ten for 53 was the first time a bowler had taken all ten wickets in a Test innings. Only two bowlers have achieved the feat since, India&#x27;s Anil Kumble, who took ten for 74 against Pakistan in 1999, and New Zealander Ajaz Patel, who took ten for 119 against India in 2021. Including Laker himself with nine for 37 in the first innings, there have been 17 instances of a bowler taking nine wickets in a Test match innings. Laker&#x27;s match bowling figures of nineteen for 90 remain a world record in first-class cricket. The record for the most wickets taken in a Test match was previously held by England&#x27;s Sydney Barnes who took seventeen for 159 at the Old Wanderers, in Johannesburg, against South Africa in December 1913. Barnes remains the only bowler other than Laker to take seventeen in a Test match. Two common factors link Laker and Barnes. They are the only two bowlers who have taken seventeen or more wickets in a Test match and they both played for Saltaire in the Bradford League, Barnes from 1915 to 1923, Laker from 1938 to 1940. Laker is the only bowler to have taken more than eighteen wickets in a first-class match. There had been 23 previous instances of seventeen or more in a match but, since Laker&#x27;s feat, only John Davison of Canada in 2004 and Kyle Abbott of Hampshire in 2019 have taken seventeen wickets in a match.

===1956–57 to 1964===
Laker toured South Africa with MCC in 1956–57, playing in fourteen matches including all five Tests. He took fifty wickets, which was his career-best tally in an overseas season. He played in four Tests against the West Indies in 1957 and four against New Zealand in 1958.

The 1958 season was the last of Surrey&#x27;s seven consecutive County Championships but it was marred by a quarrel between Laker and the team captain Peter May, who had accused Laker of &quot;not trying&quot; in a match against Kent at Blackheath in July. Kent won the match by 29 runs. Laker bowled a total of 54 overs in the match and that immediately followed a haul of 63 overs in a match against Glamorgan at Swansea, which Surrey won. It seems that Laker&#x27;s spinning finger was definitely suffering from &quot;wear and tear&quot; at the time and this probably reduced his effectiveness. His colleagues held differing views about the matter. Peter Loader said May was completely out of order while Micky Stewart suggested that May should have been aware that &quot;Jim was knackered&quot;. Godfrey Evans, who played for Kent in the match, said that Laker was &quot;ill-supported by May&quot;. Raman Subba Row blamed May for his &quot;management style&quot; which was not at all people-oriented, unlike that of Stuart Surridge, May&#x27;s predecessor as Surrey captain, who was a &quot;people person&quot; and &quot;down to earth&quot;. On the other hand, Arthur McIntyre blamed Laker for his batting in the Kent match because he &quot;holed out&quot; and made a more general comment about Laker &quot;crying wolf&quot; over injuries to his fingers.

On England&#x27;s disastrous tour of Australia in 1958–59, Laker was one of the few players to enhance his reputation, bowling well on unhelpful pitches, but he badly damaged his spin finger and had to return home early. He played in ten matches including four Tests. The fifth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in February was his last. He was not selected by England for the series against India in 1959. Because of his damaged finger, he decided to retire from playing at the end of the season, in which Surrey surrendered the title to Yorkshire. His final match for Surrey was against Northamptonshire at The Oval in September. Surrey lost by four wickets and Laker took only one wicket.

In 1960, Laker&#x27;s ghost-written autobiography &quot;Over To Me&quot; was published. It was controversial because it contained severe criticism of May, especially about the row which followed the match against Kent at Blackheath in 1958. Hill says that the book &quot;testified primarily to Laker&#x27;s abiding dislike of the social chasm in cricket&quot; created by amateurism. Micky Stewart commented on Laker&#x27;s view that the game should not be run by the &quot;traditional Oxbridge axis&quot; by saying Laker firmly believed that ability and not background were what counted in administration of the sport, but Stewart added that Laker had no problems with Oxbridge amateurs who were capable. Official displeasure with &quot;Over To Me&quot; led to the withdrawal by Surrey of Laker&#x27;s free entry pass to facilities at The Oval. Soon afterwards, the MCC decided to support Surrey and cancelled Laker&#x27;s honorary membership. Both were eventually restored. Surrey reinstated his free entry pass in 1964 and the MCC his honorary membership in 1967.

In 1962, Laker was &quot;persuaded&quot; out of retirement by his old England team-mate Trevor Bailey and, as an amateur, he played in thirty matches for Essex. He remained a formidable bowler through 1962 and 1963, and twice won matches with ten-wicket hauls. He was less effective in the 1964 season, after which he retired for good.

===Statistical summary===
Alan Hill&#x27;s biography includes an extensive statistical appendix, compiled by Paul E. Dyson.

Laker made his first-class debut on 17 July 1946, playing for Surrey against the Combined Services XI at The Oval. His last appearance in a first-class match was on 27 February 1965, playing for the International Cavaliers XI against Barbados at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown. He played in 450 first-class matches and took a total of 1,944 wickets. His best return was ten for 53 in the 1956 Test at Old Trafford. His career average was 18.41 runs per wicket. He captured five wickets in an innings on 127 occasions and ten wickets in a match 32 times. His best season total was 166 wickets at 15.32 in 1950. His best season average was an outstanding 14.23 in 1958, the last year of Surrey&#x27;s run of seven titles, when he took 116 wickets. He first took 100 wickets in a season in 1948 and achieved the target in eleven consecutive seasons to 1958. Laker&#x27;s best overseas tally was 50 in 1956–57 on the MCC tour of South Africa. His best overseas average was 15.79 in 1951–52, taking 24 wickets, when he played for Auckland.

Although he was a tail end batsman, he scored two centuries with a highest score of 113 (in 1954) and had one score of 99 among eighteen half-centuries. His career batting total was 7,304 runs at the average of 16.60 runs per completed innings. His best season total was 828 runs at 24.35 in 1948. He usually fielded in the gully position and held 271 career catches, with a best season performance in 1954 when he held 29 in as many matches.

Laker made his Test debut for England on 21 January 1948, playing against the West Indies at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown. His last appearance in a Test match was on 18 February 1959 against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He played in 46 Tests and took 193 wickets at the average of 21.24. His best return was, as above, ten for 53. He took five wickets in an innings nine times and ten in a match three times. His best series return was 46 wickets at 9.60 against Australia in 1956. He scored 676 runs at 14.08 in Test matches, including two half-centuries with a highest score of 63 against Australia in 1948. He held a total of 12 catches.

==Issues with amateurism==
According to the former amateur player Charles Williams, Laker was a &quot;serial complainer&quot; about &quot;shamateurism&quot;. Unfortunately, however, he sometimes spoke and acted unwisely in his opposition to the amateur concept which, in any event, was abolished only three years after he retired.

In March 1958, an MCC sub-committee delivered a report on the continuance of amateurism with special emphasis on the question of broken-time payments. Soon afterwards, Laker addressed a meeting of The Cricket Society and declared that a cricketer who can&#x27;t afford to play as an amateur should either turn professional or stop playing. He described broken-time payments as &quot;poppycock&quot; because they were &quot;payments on the side&quot; that enabled amateurs to make more money than professionals; even so, he was not saying anything new as the issue pre-dated even the Grace brothers. After MCC announced their squad to tour Australia in 1958–59, Laker proposed to turn amateur for the duration of the tour and then become a professional again on his return to Surrey. His thinking was based on the possible misinformation that amateurs on the tour would be paid an allowance of £1,000 (£ in 2021 terms) to cover their expenses while the professionals were to receive a fee of £800 (£ in 2021 terms). MCC refused his request. Williams wrote that Laker ruined his case through characteristic bluntness and by not fully understanding the reasons why amateurism existed, rightly or wrongly, in the first place. Ironically, Laker did end up playing as an amateur when he came out of retirement to join Essex in 1962.

==Style and personality==
In the 1986 &quot;Barclays World of Cricket&quot;, Colin Cowdrey wrote a mini-biography of Laker, whom he praised as &quot;perhaps the best off-spin bowler the game has seen&quot;. Cowdrey described Laker as the &quot;perfect model&quot; for an aspiring slow bowler because he was tall and strong with big hands and a high action. Laker&#x27;s strength gave him the capability to undertake long spells of bowling. His varied flight of the ball was difficult for the batsman to predict and, if he was given any assistance by pitch or weather conditions, Laker could generate extra pace and spin so as to be at times &quot;almost unplayable&quot;.

John Arlott once wrote that batsmen at the non-striking end &quot;could hear the ball buzz&quot; as Laker imparted spin on to it. Gary Sobers agreed with him, saying that &quot;you could hear the ball fizz as Jim spun it&quot;. Sobers said that Laker was &quot;undoubtedly the best off-spinner I ever saw&quot; with Lance Gibbs not far behind. Sobers was especially wary of Laker&#x27;s straight ball because, unusual among spinners, it was delivered at lesser pace than his spinning deliveries and it &quot;drifted&quot; (i.e., as an outswinger).

Fred Trueman, who knew and got along with Laker very well, described him as &quot;a modest, laconic, sometimes dour guy&quot;. Like everyone else in cricket, Trueman was astounded by Laker&#x27;s world record at Old Trafford in 1956 but was more impressed by Laker&#x27;s &quot;self-effacing&quot; reaction to the achievement. As Trueman says, photographs of Laker in the next day&#x27;s newspapers show him strolling towards the pavilion, not even smiling, sweater over his shoulder, &quot;as if returning from net practice&quot;. Trueman went on to say how he &quot;shuddered to think&quot; what sort of posturing would ensue in the unlikely event that Laker&#x27;s performance should be matched by a 21st-century cricketer.

In Peter May&#x27;s autobiography, he wrote about how Arthur McIntyre kept superbly to the great Surrey bowling attack of Bedser, Loader, Laker and Lock on difficult wickets. McIntyre himself said that, of the four, he had the greatest difficulty keeping wicket to Laker who &quot;spun the ball so viciously&quot;.

In 2006, Peter Richardson considered the differences between Laker and Lock, saying that Laker was &quot;slightly cynical, difficult to connect with, laconic and moody&quot;. Richardson said that Laker and Lock did not get on together and were always competing. Their approaches to the game differed as Lock &quot;would attack&quot; while Laker just kept &quot;chipping away&quot;. Richie Benaud had also noted their different characteristics in the way they appealed for a dismissal: &quot;Laker was apologetic, Lock a demander&quot;. May, who was Laker&#x27;s Surrey captain after Stuart Surridge retired in 1956, said that the mere idea of Laker showing enthusiasm was &quot;absurd&quot;.

==Personal life and post-retirement==
Having recovered from the sinusitis he contracted in India in December 1950, Laker began to think seriously about marriage. He had courted his fiancée Lilly for some years. She was born in Vienna but, opposed to Nazism, she left Austria after the Anschluss and was in the Middle East when World War II began. She joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service in Cairo and met Laker when he was posted there with the RAOC. They worked in the same office and then met again in London at a service reunion event. They married on 27 March 1951 at the Kensington register office and spent a rain-swept honeymoon in Bournemouth before the cricket season began. Lilly survived Laker by 35 years, dying in September 2021 at the age of 102. She and their daughters Fiona and Angela helped Alan Hill with his research for Laker&#x27;s biography.

Being Austrian, Lilly did not know much about cricket. She took numerous congratulatory telephone calls after his 19-wicket feat and, when Laker arrived home, she asked him: &quot;Jim, did you do something good today?&quot;

In July 1956, only three weeks before his record-breaking performance at Old Trafford, Laker was Roy Plomley&#x27;s guest on his &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; radio programme. His musical choices included &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; by Paul Robeson, songs by Vera Lynn and Gracie Fields and classical pieces by Pietro Mascagni and Franz Schubert. His luxury choices were a piano and a cricket ball.

Laker developed an interest in broadcasting and, after he retired from playing, became a highly regarded cricket commentator for ITV from 1966 to 1968 and for BBC Television from 1968 until his death in 1986. Fellow commentator John Arlott described Laker&#x27;s commentary style as: &quot;Wry, dry, laconic, he thought about cricket with a deep intensity and a splendidly ironic point of view&quot; whilst Colin Cowdrey praised Laker&#x27;s &quot;own brand of television commentary&quot; that made him a respected figure in the medium. Ted Dexter, as a summariser, worked with commentators Laker and Richie Benaud at the BBC and later remarked on how &quot;a new style of interpretation had evolved as ball-by-ball commentary became their preserve&quot;, their trademarks being &quot;patience, accuracy and persistence&quot;. The commentary was spoofed in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; &quot;Trailer&quot; sketch in the &quot;Archaeology Today&quot; episode in 1970.

Laker was still employed by the BBC when he died at the Parkside Clinic in Wimbledon, aged 64, on 23 April 1986. The cause of death was complications from gall bladder surgery. His body was cremated at Putney Vale Crematorium and his ashes were scattered at The Oval.

<doc id="263479" wikidata="Q386246" url="?curid=263479" title="Nippon Budokan">
<text>The , often shortened to simply Budokan, is an indoor arena in Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan. It was originally built for the inaugural Olympic judo competition in the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Budokan was a popular venue for Japanese professional wrestling for a time, and it has hosted numerous other sporting events, such as the 1967 Women&#x27;s Volleyball World Championship. Most recently, the arena hosted the Olympic debut of karate in the 2020 Summer Olympics, as well as the judo competition at both the 2020 Summer Olympics and the 2020 Summer Paralympics.

While its primary purpose is to host martial arts contests, the arena has gained additional fame as one of the world&#x27;s most outstanding musical performance venues. A number of famous acts have played at the Budokan. The Beatles were the first rock group to play there, in a series of concerts held between June 30 and July 2, 1966. ABBA ended their and held their final live performance there in March 1980. Numerous acts have recorded live albums at the Budokan, including Casiopea, Joe Hisaishi, Blur, Incubus, TVXQ, Bryan Adams, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Eric Clapton, Cheap Trick, Neil Young, Dream Theater, Duran Duran, Toto, Kiss, Ozzy Osbourne, Mariah Carey, Judas Priest, Paul McCartney, Asia, Ringo Starr, Journey, Deep Purple, Masayoshi Takanaka, Hoshimachi Suisei, Michael Schenker Group and Helloween.

==Location==
The Nippon Budokan is located in Kitanomaru Park in the center of Tokyo, two minutes&#x27; walking distance from Kudanshita Subway Station, and near the Imperial Palace and Yasukuni Shrine. The 42 m (140 ft) high octagonal structure holds 14,471 people (arena seats: 2,946, 1st floor seats: 3,199, 2nd floor seats: 7,846, standee: 480). The building is modeled after Yumedono (Hall of Dreams) in Hōryū-ji in Nara.

==Venue history==
===Martial arts===


Although the Budokan also functions as a venue for big musical events, its primary purpose is for Japanese martial arts. The national championships of the different branches of major martial arts (judo, kendo, karate, aikido, etc.) are held annually at the Budokan. The Budokan has also been associated with professional wrestling&#x27;s big shows, typically from All Japan Pro Wrestling and Pro Wrestling Noah. However, due to declining audiences following the death of Mitsuharu Misawa and the retirement of Kenta Kobashi, professional wrestling has ceased running regular shows in the Budokan. During Wrestle Kingdom 12, New Japan Pro-Wrestling announced that its yearly G1 Climax tournament&#x27;s finals would be held at the Budokan.

The Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki hybrid rules fight held at the Budokan in 1976 is seen as a forerunner to mixed martial arts. K-1, Shooto, Vale Tudo Japan and Pride Fighting Championships have all held events at the arena.

===Music===

The Beatles were the first rock group to perform at the Budokan in a series of five shows held between June 30 and July 2, 1966. Their appearances were met with opposition from those who felt the appearance of a western pop group would defile the martial arts arena.

In July 1973, Japanese television recorded the Santana performance at the Budokan.

The Budokan gained worldwide fame when American artists Cheap Trick and Bob Dylan used the arena to record their performances, &quot;Cheap Trick at Budokan&quot; (1978) and &quot;Bob Dylan at Budokan&quot; (1979). The venue is popular for recording live albums because it has good acoustics, is relatively large and Japanese audiences are known for being highly appreciative when appropriate but quiet during performances. Eric Clapton described the Tokyo audience as &quot;almost overappreciative&quot; in interviews promoting &quot;Just One Night&quot; (1980), his own live album recorded at the Budokan.

American crossover thrash band Stormtroopers of Death released a live album titled &quot;Live at Budokan&quot; (1992), though the title was in jest and the album was recorded at famed New York City venue The Ritz.

The original Beatles concert is heavily bootlegged on audio and video; the first night&#x27;s concert video was officially released by Apple Records in Japan only as &quot;Beatles Concert at Budokan 1966&quot;, and excerpts are shown in &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;, while the second &quot;Anthology&quot; album included the first show&#x27;s performances of &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s A Woman&quot;. The venue is one of the stages in &quot;The Beatles: Rock Band&quot; video game. Chatmonchy currently holds the record for the largest crowd at the Budokan.

The record for the most Budokan music concerts is held by Eikichi Yazawa, 142 times as of December 19, 2017.

<doc id="263481" wikidata="Q1390688" url="?curid=263481" title="Michael Noonan (Fine Gael politician)">
<text>Michael Noonan (born 21 May 1943) is an Irish former Fine Gael politician who served as Minister for Finance from 2011 to 2017, Leader of the Opposition and Leader of Fine Gael from 2001 to 2002, Minister for Health from 1994 to 1997, Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1986 to 1987, Minister for Energy from January 1987 to March 1987 and Minister for Justice from 1982 to 1986. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1981 to 2020.

Noonan had been a member of every Fine Gael cabinet since 1982, serving in the cabinets of Garret FitzGerald, John Bruton and Enda Kenny. During these terms of office, he held the positions of Justice, Energy, Industry and Commerce, Health and Finance. When Fine Gael lost power after the 1997 general election, Noonan remained an important figure in the party when he became Opposition Spokesperson for Finance.

He succeeded John Bruton as Leader of Fine Gael and Leader of the Opposition in 2001, however, he resigned following Fine Gael&#x27;s disastrous showing at the 2002 general election. After eight years as a backbencher, during which time he served as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny appointed Noonan to his front bench in 2010, to his former portfolio of Spokesperson for Finance.

==Early life==
The son of a local school teacher, Noonan was born in Limerick in 1943, but raised in Loughill, County Limerick. He was educated at the local National School and St. Patrick&#x27;s Secondary School in Glin, before studying to be a primary school teacher at St. Patrick&#x27;s College, Drumcondra, Dublin. He subsequently completed a BA and H.Dip. in English and Economics at University College Dublin. He began to work as a secondary school teacher in Dublin. Noonan developed an interest in politics from his mother, whose family had been heavily involved in Fine Gael at the local level in Limerick, and joined the Dublin branch of the party after graduating from university. He returned to Limerick in the late 1960s, where he took up a teaching post at Crescent College. Here he continued his involvement in politics, canvassing for the Fine Gael candidate, James O&#x27;Higgins, in the Limerick East by-election in 1968, caused by the death of Donogh O&#x27;Malley.

==Political career==
===Early years: 1974–1982===
Having been involved in the local Fine Gael organisation in Limerick since the late 1960s, Noonan first held political office in 1974, when he was elected as a member of Limerick County Council. Having built up a local profile he contested the 1981 general election for the party and secured a seat in Limerick East. Upon taking his Dáil seat, Noonan became a full-time politician, giving up his teaching post and resigning his seat on Limerick County Council. Though Fine Gael formed a coalition government with the Labour Party, Noonan, as a first time TD, remained on the backbenches.

===Cabinet minister: 1982–1987===
Fine Gael lost power following the first general election in early 1982, however, Noonan subsequently joined the party&#x27;s new front bench as Spokesperson for Education. A second general election in late 1982 following the collapse of the Fianna Fáil government, saw another Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition come to power. Just eighteen months after entering the Dáil, Noonan was appointed to the highly sensitive position of Minister for Justice. After a few weeks in office, he revealed the illegal phone-tapping of journalists&#x27; phones, carried out by the previous Fianna Fáil administration that preceded it in power. That government had authorised illegal phone tapping of the journalists Geraldine Kennedy, Bruce Arnold and Vincent Browne. Seán Doherty signed warrants for the taps while serving as Minister for Justice. Noonan introduced a new Criminal Justice Bill while also bringing in reforms in the Garda Síochána, the courts and the prison service and the facing down of a difficult prison officers&#x27; dispute. He also dealt with the wording of the controversial abortion referendum in 1983. Noonan, however, also presided over the justice ministry when inmates in an overcrowded and understaffed Spike Island prison set fire to the building.

A cabinet reshuffle in 1986, saw Noonan demoted to the position of Minister for Industry and Commerce. Following the withdrawal of the Labour Party from government in 1987, Noonan also briefly took office as Minister for Energy.

===Opposition: 1987–1994===
Fine Gael lost power following the 1987 general election and was confined to the opposition benches. The new Fine Gael leader, Alan Dukes, appointed Noonan to the senior position of front bench Spokesperson for Finance and the Public Service. The party did poorly under Dukes and he was replaced by John Bruton in 1990. Noonan was retained on the new front bench, however, he was demoted to the position of Spokesperson for Transport, Energy and Communications. In 1991, he returned to local politics as a member of Limerick County Council, serving again until 1994. Noonan&#x27;s period in opposition often saw him at odds with his party leader. Not long after his demotion as Spokesperson for Finance, he announced that he would be taking &quot;positions of leadership&quot; on a wide range of important issues. This was seen as a veiled threat to John Bruton&#x27;s leadership, with Noonan positioning himself as an alternative party leader. In 1994, several Fine Gael TDs attempted to oust Bruton as party leader following poor showings in opinion polls. Noonan aligned himself with the rebels and stated that he would stand for the leadership should Bruton be defeated. The latter survived as leader and Noonan resigned from the front bench.

===Minister for Health: 1994–1997===

In 1994, the &#x27;Rainbow Coalition&#x27; was formed and Noonan became Minister for Health. The Department of Health was embroiled in a scandal at the time regarding blood products contaminated with Hepatitis C virus, caused by the negligence of the Blood Transfusion Service Board. Noonan consistently held an authoritarian line on the case of Brigid McCole and would not budge on his views, suffering as a result of the scandal. He threatened to take Bridget&#x27;s mother Ellen to the Supreme Court, when she wondered why her daughter had contracted the disease. Noonan was forced to establish the Hepatitis C Tribunal of Inquiry and to issue several apologies for his handling of the affair. Noonan remained as Minister for Health until the 1997 general election. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; said &quot;the woman involved had been infected by a negligent State agency, in the biggest health scandal since its foundation.&quot; When RTÉ broadcast a drama, &quot;No Tears&quot;, on Noonan&#x27;s treatment of Bridget McCole, Justine McCarthy wrote in the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; that Noonan &quot;compounded the perception of a heartless pedant by whingeing about the way he was depicted in the drama&#x27;s final episode, broadcast on the same night that he declined to appear on &quot;Questions &amp; Answers&quot; and when it was reported that yet another woman who was infected by the State had died from the illness.&quot;

His home was picketed by anti-abortion campaign group Youth Defence.

===Return to Opposition: 1997–2011===
====Leader of Fine Gael: 2001–2002====
Despite increasing their seats to 54, Fine Gael returned to opposition and Noonan became Opposition Spokesman for Finance following the 1997 general election. In 2001, following a series of disastrous opinion polls, Noonan and his colleague, Jim Mitchell, tabled a motion of no confidence in the leader, John Bruton. The motion was successful in ousting Bruton as leader, with Noonan becoming leader of Fine Gael and Leader of the Opposition with Mitchell becoming deputy leader. Noonan avoided requests to be interviewed on TV and radio programmes, including some on RTÉ and Today FM, ahead of the leadership election.

At the 2002 general election, Fine Gael had a disastrous result, dropping from 54 seats to 31 and several high-profile front bench member losses, including Alan Dukes, Deirdre Clune, Alan Shatter and deputy leader Jim Mitchell. Noonan resigned as Fine Gael leader on the night of the election.

====TD: 2002–2011====
He was replaced by Enda Kenny, the runner-up to Noonan in the 2001 leadership election. However, Noonan remained as a TD and was re-elected at the 2007 general election, and went on to serve on Kenny&#x27;s Front bench. He was vice-chairperson of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Constitutional Amendment and Children.

===Minister for Finance: 2011–2017===
In July 2010, Noonan was promoted to the Fine Gael Front Bench as Spokesperson for Finance. In an August 2010 interview with the Sunday Independent, Noonan said he hoped to become Minister for Finance. 
At the 2011 general election, he was re-elected as a TD for Limerick City, receiving 13,291 (30.8% 1st preference) votes. On 9 March 2011, he was appointed Minister for Finance by Taoiseach Enda Kenny.

In March 2011, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Union (EU) backed the proposed programme for government and gave the coalition the green light to make changes to the terms of the multibillion-euro bailout. After meeting officials from the IMF – including Ireland mission head Ajai Chopra – European Central Bank (ECB) and European Commission (EC), Noonan said it was agreed the terms of the rescue deal would be altered, as long as the financial targets remain the same. &quot;What was being discussed in general terms was our proposal that the conditions and the memorandum of understanding would be changed for alternative conditions which are in the programme for government,&quot; Noonan said.

In July 2011, Noonan speaking after an EU summit on 21 July said that the new deal agreed with euro zone leaders means a second bailout for Ireland is &quot;off the table&quot;. The deal will see a reduction in the interest rate on bailout loans to Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Italy. This followed a 10-hour emergency summit at which eurozone leaders agreed to provide a second international bailout worth €109 billion to Greece. The plan will be funded by eurozone countries, the proceeds of privatisations and the anticipated €12.6 billion benefit of a debt buyback programme. Noonan said a provision in the agreement meant Ireland would not have to go back to markets when the programme ended if the country had not reached its deficit target. &quot;There&#x27;s a commitment that if countries continue to fulfil the conditions of their programme, the European authorities will continue to supply them with money even when the programme concludes,&quot; he said. There would be &quot;little or no easing&quot; of budgetary conditions for this year, but there could be more positive implications in later years. &quot;I&#x27;m afraid we still have to face the music in December,&quot; he said.

In November 2011, he said the payment of more than €700 million to Anglo Irish Bank bondholders was &quot;the lesser of two evils&quot;. On 16 May 2012, Noonan caused controversy with his Greek &quot;holidays&quot; and &quot;feta cheese&quot; comment at a breakfast briefing with Bloomberg news agency. Noonan said these were the only links between Ireland and Greece. He attended the 2012 Bilderberg Conference in his capacity of Minister for Finance at Chantilly, Virginia, from 31 May-3 June 2012. On 5 December 2012, he delivered his second budget as Minister for Finance, which included a new property tax to be introduced in 2013.

In February 2013, a deal was reached with the European Central Bank (ECB) about the promissory note used to bail out the former Anglo Irish Bank. Noonan said that the government had achieved its objectives in the negotiations with the ECB and that the arrangement meant that there would be €1bn less taken from them in terms of taxes and spending cuts up to 2015. Noonan said that the government did not ask for a write down on the Anglo Irish debt during negotiations with the ECB as &quot;the ECB does not do write-downs&quot;.
On 15 October 2013, he delivered the budget for 2014.

Following improvements in Ireland&#x27;s unemployment rate and outlook for growth, the securing of the February 2013 Anglo Irish Bank promissory note deal with the European Central Bank, and Ireland&#x27;s exit from the EU/IMF/ECB bailout programme and successful return to the bond markets, Noonan was named Europe&#x27;s best Finance Minister for the previous year in January 2014 by the Financial Times-owned magazine The Banker.

When the European Central Bank raised the limit on the amount of emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) available to Greek banks by about €2 billion at the height of the country&#x27;s government-debt crisis in June 2015, Noonan joined his German counterpart Wolfgang Schäuble in arguing forcefully for limits on the amount of ELA approved by the central bank unless capital controls were introduced.

In July 2016, the Central Statistics Office announced 2015 Irish GDP growth of 26.3% and Irish GNP growth of 18.7%. The growth became known internationally by the pejorative term, leprechaun economics. Noonan attributed the figures to multinational restructuring following the closure of the double Irish tax scheme, however they were subsequently attributed to Apple in 2018 (widely suspected in 2016). Noonan came to the defense of Apple when the European Commission announced in August 2016 that it had found against Apple in its investigation of illegal State aid. Noonan led the rejection of any claim by Ireland to the EU Commission&#x27;s €13 billion fine on Apple, calling it an &quot;attack&quot; by the commission, and was supported by the main opposition party. In October 2016, Noonan introduced changes in the 2016 Finance Act to curb tax abuses of section 110 special purpose vehicles, (securitisation vehicles for IFSC firms), by US distressed debt funds in Ireland (pejoratively called vulture funds in the Irish media). Investigations into these abuses by the financial media, showed the scale and rapid gains these funds were making from NAMA&#x27;s disposal program, and that these gains were free of Irish taxes. It led to some revision as to whether Noonan had been too quick in selling State assets to distressed debt funds, and had given overly generous tax benefits and incentives.

===Retirement===
In May 2017, he announced he would be stepping down as Minister for Finance in the coming weeks when a new Taoiseach was appointed, and as a member of the Dáil at the next general election.

==Personal life==
Noonan married Florence Knightley, a native of Castlemaine, County Kerry and a primary school teacher, in 1969. They had three sons: Tim, John and Michael, and two daughters: Orla and Deirdre. In May 2010, Noonan appeared on RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;The Frontline&quot; to talk about his wife&#x27;s battle with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Florence Noonan died on 23 February 2012 of pneumonia.

<text>BNSF Railway is the largest freight railroad in the United States. One of six North American Class I railroads, BNSF has 36,000 employees, of track in 28 states, and over 8,000 locomotives. It has three transcontinental routes that provide rail connections between the western and eastern United States. BNSF trains traveled over in 2010, more than any other North American railroad.

The BNSF Railway Company is the principal operating subsidiary of parent company Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC. Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, the railroad&#x27;s parent company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., of Omaha, Nebraska. The current CEO is Kathryn Farmer.

According to corporate press releases, BNSF Railway is among the top transporters of intermodal freight in North America. It also hauls bulk cargo, including coal.

The creation of BNSF started with the formation of a holding company on September 22, 1995. This new holding company purchased the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (often called the &quot;Santa Fe&quot;) and Burlington Northern Railroad, and formally merged the railways into the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway on December 31, 1996. On January 24, 2005, the railroad&#x27;s name was officially changed to BNSF Railway Company using the initials of its original name. Warren Buffett&#x27;s Berkshire Hathaway acquired BNSF Railway in February 2010, obtaining all of its shares and taking the company private.

BNSF and its chief competitor, the Union Pacific Railroad, have a duopoly on all transcontinental freight rail lines in the Western, Midwestern and Southern United States and share trackage rights over thousands of miles of track.

==History==
BNSF&#x27;s history dates to 1849, when the Aurora Branch Railroad in Illinois and the Pacific Railroad of Missouri were formed by a group of millers who were granted a charter to build a 12-mile railroad that connected Aurora with the Galena &amp; Chicago Union Rail Road. The Aurora Branch eventually grew into the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&amp;Q), a major component of successor Burlington Northern. Part of the Pacific Railroad became the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway (Frisco).

The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) was chartered in 1859. It built one of the first transcontinental railroads in North America, linking Chicago and Southern California; major branches led to Texas, Denver, and San Francisco. The Interstate Commerce Commission denied a proposed merger with the Southern Pacific Transportation Company in the 1980s.

The Burlington Northern Railroad (BN) was created in 1970 through the consolidation of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, the Great Northern Railway, the Northern Pacific Railway and the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway. It absorbed the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway (Frisco) in 1980. Its main lines included Chicago-Seattle with branches to Texas (ex-Burlington) and Birmingham, Alabama (ex-Frisco), and access to the low-sulfur coal of Wyoming&#x27;s Powder River Basin.

The city of Burlington, Iowa is the namesake of Burlington in each of Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, Burlington Northern Railroad, and BNSF.

===BN-ATSF merger===

On June 30, 1994, BN and ATSF announced plans to merge. They were the largest and smallest (by track mileage) of the &quot;Super Seven&quot;, the seven largest of the then-twelve U.S. Class I railroads. The long-rumored announcement was delayed by a disagreement over the disposition of Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corporation, a gold mining subsidiary that ATSF agreed to sell to stockholders. This announcement began the next wave of mergers, as the &quot;Super Seven&quot; were merged down to four in the next five years. The Illinois Central Railroad and Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS), two of the five &quot;small&quot; Class Is, announced on July 19 that the former would buy the latter, but this plan was called off on October 25. The Union Pacific Railroad (UP), another major Western system, started a bidding war with BN for control of the SF on October 5. The UP gave up on January 31, 1995, paving the way for the BN-ATSF merger. Subsequently, the UP acquired the Southern Pacific Transportation Company (SP) in 1996, and Eastern U.S. systems CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern Railway split Conrail in 1999.

On February 7, 1995, BN and ATSF heads Gerald Grinstein and Robert D. Krebs announced that shareholders had approved the plan, which would save overhead costs and combine BN&#x27;s coal and ATSF&#x27;s intermodal strengths. Although the two systems complemented each other with little overlap, in contrast to the Santa Fe-Southern Pacific merger, which failed because it would have eliminated competition in many areas of the Southwest, BN and ATSF came to agreements with most other Class Is to keep them from opposing the merger. UP was satisfied with a single segment of trackage rights from Abilene, Kansas, to Superior, Nebraska, which BN and ATSF had both served. KCS gained haulage rights to several Midwest locations, including Omaha, East St. Louis, and Memphis, in exchange for BNSF getting similar access to New Orleans. SP, initially requesting far-reaching trackage rights throughout the West, soon agreed to a reduced plan, whereby SP acquired trackage rights on ATSF for intermodal and automotive traffic to Chicago, and other trackage rights on ATSF in Kansas, south to Texas, and between Colorado and Texas. In exchange, SP assigned BNSF trackage rights over the former Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad between El Paso and Topeka and haulage rights to the Mexican border at Eagle Pass, Texas. Regional Toledo, Peoria and Western Railway also obtained trackage rights over BN from Peoria to Galesburg, Illinois, a BN hub where it could interchange with SP (which had rights on BN dating from 1990). The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) approved the BNSF merger on July 20, 1995 (with final approval on August 23), less than a month before UP announced on August 3 that it would acquire SP. Parents Burlington Northern Inc. and Santa Fe Pacific Corporation were acquired on September 22, 1995, by the new Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation. The merger of the operating companies was held up by issues with unions; ATSF merged on December 31, 1996, into BN, which was renamed the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company.

===Effect of UP-SP merger===
Union Pacific&#x27;s merger with Southern Pacific further enlarged the combined BNSF network. Unlike BN and ATSF, UP and SP had significant overlap, where the end of competition between the two risked creating a monopoly for freight carriage in much of the West. UP and BNSF announced in late September 1995 that, in exchange for BNSF not opposing the merger, it would obtain ownership of of line and about of trackage rights to reach these &quot;two-to-one&quot; shippers. Significant additions included rights over SP&#x27;s Central Corridor from Denver via the Moffat Tunnel and Salt Lake City, and over Donner Pass, to the San Francisco Bay Area, with an alternate route through the Feather River Canyon along UP. The ATSF trackage in California&#x27;s Central Valley was linked to BN&#x27;s line into Oregon, through trackage rights over UP between Stockton and Keddie and acquisition of UP&#x27;s section of the &quot;Inside Gateway&quot; to the beginning of BN trackage at Bieber. In Texas, BNSF received rights in several directions from the Houston area: west over UP to San Antonio, with a branch to Waco, and continuing over SP to Eagle Pass (replacing the haulage rights they had just obtained); south over UP to Brownsville; east over SP to New Orleans (including the purchase of this line east of Lake Charles); and northeast over SP to Memphis with a branch on UP to Little Rock. Ownership of a short connection between Waxahachie and Dallas also went from UP to BNSF. UP, in return, got a few short sections of trackage rights over BNSF, mainly connecting the SP at Chemult to the UP at Bend, Oregon, and connecting the SP at Mojave, California with existing UP rights on ATSF at Barstow, California. On April 18, 1996, UP, BNSF, and the Chemical Manufacturers Association entered into an agreement giving BNSF rights over the UP line between Houston and East St. Louis, paralleling the Houston-Memphis SP line, and allowing BNSF to participate in the UP&#x27;s plan for directional running, in which each line would serve through trains in only one direction. The Surface Transportation Board, successor to the ICC, approved the UP-SP merger on July 3, and UP control of SP took effect on September 11, 1996. BNSF trackage rights operations began on the Central Corridor on October 10, and soon thereafter on other lines.

BNSF continued projects started by its predecessors, most notably BN&#x27;s work on reopening Stampede Pass. BN had closed Stampede Pass, the Northern Pacific Railway&#x27;s main line across Washington, in 1984, in favor of the ex-Great Northern Railway&#x27;s Stevens Pass. BN never abandoned the line and began rehabilitating it in early 1996, and the route reopened in early December, relieving the crowded Stevens Pass. The ex-ATSF main line, now known as the Southern Transcon, has also seen steady work to add tracks, giving BNSF more capacity on this major intermodal route.

===Attempted merger with CN===
On December 20, 1999, BNSF and the recently privatized Canadian National Railway announced plans to combine as subsidiaries of a new holding company, North American Railways, which would control about of railroad. With CN&#x27;s lines primarily in Canada and, through subsidiary Illinois Central Railroad, on a north–south corridor near BNSF&#x27;s eastern edge, the two systems had little overlap. The combination would have benefited both companies by expanding available cash for capacity improvements and allowing for longer single-system movements. Shippers and the Surface Transportation Board expressed concern and surprise about the timing, since the merger that produced BNSF had been the only one in the 1990s that did not cause severe deterioration in service. On March 17, 2000, the STB imposed a 15-month moratorium on mergers involving any two Class I railroads, citing widespread opposition not only to the merger but its effects, likely starting the final round of mergers into two big systems. BNSF and CN immediately turned to the U.S. Court of Appeals, which on July 14 ruled that the STB&#x27;s right to regulate mergers allowed a moratorium, and the two railroads called off the merger. The STB released its final rules on June 11, 2001, requiring any new application to merge two Class I railroads, with the exception of smaller Kansas City Southern Railway, to demonstrate that competition would be preserved and address effects of defensive moves by other carriers. No further Class I mergers would take place until the merger between Kansas City Southern and Canadian Pacific in April 2023, creating the Canadian Pacific Kansas City Railway.

===Acquisition by Berkshire Hathaway===
The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation was incorporated in 1993 to facilitate the merger of Burlington Northern, Incorporated, parent of the Burlington Northern Railroad, and Santa Fe Pacific Corporation, which owned the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (Santa Fe). The corporate merger was consummated on September 22, 1995, at which point shareholders of the previous companies became shareholders of BNSF and the two companies became wholly owned subsidiaries of BNSF. In December 1996, the two holding companies and two railroads were formally merged, and in January 1998 the remaining intermediate holding company was folded into the railroad.

Robert Krebs of Santa Fe Pacific was president of BNSF from the merger until 1999, chief executive from the merger until 2000, and chairman from 1997 until 2002. He was succeeded in all three positions by Matthew K. Rose.

On November 3, 2009, Berkshire Hathaway made a $26 billion offer to buy the remaining 77.4% of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation it did not already own, valuing the purchase at $34 billion. The deal, including Berkshire&#x27;s previous investment and the assumption of $10 billion in Burlington Northern debt, brings the total value to $44 billion. Consummated February 12, 2010, it is the largest acquisition in Berkshire Hathaway&#x27;s history.

The deal was structured so that the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation would merge with and into R Acquisition Company, LLC, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway. The deal closed on February 12, 2010, and at the same time, the now merged company changed its name to Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC. It remains an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway.

=== Acquisition of Montana Rail Link ===
In January 2022, BNSF agreed to purchase Montana Rail Link, a private company, for $2 billion, through an &quot;early lease termination&quot;. The return to BNSF control required the approval of the Surface Transportation Board, which was approved on March 8, 2023. The railroad had over of track, and served 100 stations. The main classification yard was in Laurel, Montana, with smaller yards in Missoula, Billings, Bozeman and Helena.

BNSF took over MRL operations on January 1, 2024. This absorbed the MRL into BNSF, integrating MRL operations, technology and personnel. All 1,200 employees were offered employment with BNSF.

==Operations==

===Markets and services===

With BNSF&#x27;s large system, it hauls many different commodities, most notably coal and grain, as well as intermodal freight.

Predecessor Burlington Northern Railroad (BN) entered Wyoming&#x27;s low-sulfur coal-rich Powder River Basin in the 1970s through construction of the Powder River Basin Joint Line with Union Pacific Railroad predecessor Chicago and North Western Transportation Company. Coal goes north in unit trains on the three-to-four-track Joint Line to Gillette or south to Orin, where older BN lines and other railroads take it in all directions to coal-burning power plants.

BNSF serves over 1,500 grain elevators, located mostly in the Midwest on former BN lines. Depending on where the markets are, this grain may move in any direction in unit trains or wait in silos for demand to rise. Most commonly, grain may move west on the Northern Transcon to the Pacific Northwest and its export terminals, or south to ports in Texas and the Gulf of Mexico.

The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway&#x27;s main contribution to BNSF was the Southern Transcon, a fast intermodal corridor connecting Southern California and Chicago. Most traffic is either trailers of trucking companies such as intermodal partner J. B. Hunt, or containers from the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. The latter begins its trip on the triple-track Alameda Corridor, shared with the Union Pacific Railroad, and then follows BNSF rails from downtown Los Angeles. Its route, the Southern Transcon, has been almost completely double-tracked, and triple-tracking has begun in areas such as Cajon Pass.

BNSF transports Boeing 737 fuselages from the Wichita, Kansas plant to Renton, Washington.

===Finances===
===Trackage===

BNSF Railway directly owns and operates track in 28 U.S. states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The railway also operates a small amount of track in Canada, including an approximate section that runs from the U.S.–Canada border to Vancouver, British Columbia, some tracks and a yard in Winnipeg, Manitoba, approximately of joint track with the Canadian National Railway, which runs south to the U.S. border at Emerson, Manitoba, and less than a kilometer of trackage at the border in Northgate, Saskatchewan.

For administrative purposes, BNSF is divided into two regions and ten operating divisions. The North Region includes the Montana, Northwest, Twin Cities, Heartland and Powder River divisions. The South Region includes the Red River, California, Chicago, Kansas and Southwest divisions. Each division is further divided into subdivisions, which represent segments of track ranging from mainlines to branch-lines. The former Texas and Gulf divisions were combined into the Red River Division, and the former Springfield and Nebraska divisions were combined into the Heartland Division, in the spring of 2016.

Not including second, third and fourth main-line trackage, yard trackage, and siding trackage, BNSF directly owns and operates over of track. When these additional tracks are counted, the length of track which the railway directly controls rises to more than .

Additionally, BNSF Railway has gained trackage rights on more than of track throughout the United States and Canada. These rights allow the BNSF to operate its own trains with its own crews on competing railroads&#x27; main tracks. BNSF locomotives also occasionally show up on competitors&#x27; tracks throughout the United States and Canada by way of leases, mileage equalizations, and other contractual arrangements.

===Yards and facilities===

BNSF operates various facilities all over the United States, plus a yard in Winnipeg, to support its transportation system. Facilities operated by the railway include yards and terminals throughout its rail network, system locomotive shops to perform locomotive service and maintenance, a centralized operations center for train dispatching and network operations monitoring in Fort Worth, and regional dispatching centers.

BNSF Railway also operates numerous transfer facilities throughout the western United States to facilitate the transfer of intermodal containers, trailers, and other freight traffic. BNSF Railway has direct control over a total of 33 intermodal hubs and 23 automotive distribution facilities.

The BNSF mechanical division operates 13 locomotive maintenance facilities that perform preventive maintenance, repairs and servicing of equipment. The largest of these facilities are located in Alliance, Nebraska and Argentine Yard in Kansas City, Kansas. The mechanical division also controls 46 additional facilities responsible for car maintenance and daily running repairs.

The BNSF system mechanical division, a subset of the mechanical division, operates two maintenance-of-way work equipment shops, responsible for performing repairs and preventive maintenance to BNSF&#x27;s track and equipment, in Brainerd, Minnesota and Galesburg, Illinois. The system mechanical division also operates the Western Fruit Express Company&#x27;s refrigerated car repair shop in Spokane, Washington.

On October 1, 2022, BNSF Railway announced plans to construct a $1.5 billion state of the art master planned rail facility in Southern California, the first such facility developed by a Class I railroad. The Barstow International Gateway, encompassing approximately 4,500 acres (1,800 ha, 7.0 sq mi), an integrated rail facility, will be located on the west side of Barstow, California. This new facility, when built, will enable more efficient rail operations from the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach to trains for transport through the Alameda Corridor onto the BNSF mainline to the new facility, and then move across the nation on the eastbound BNSF route network.

In June 2024, BNSF Railway announced plans to develop the Surprise Intermodal/Logistics Center, a regional rail-served facility near Phoenix, Arizona. The planned site is located in northwest Maricopa County and will cover 4,321 acres (1,749 ha) of land. The facility consists of three distinct, interrelated components:
*An intermodal facility on 1,770 acres (716 ha), which will provide a transfer hub for rail shipments by containers and trailers.
*A logistics park on 1,420 acres (575 ha), which will provide sites for warehouse and distribution facilities.
*A logistics center on 1,131 acres (458 ha), providing direct-rail-serviced sites for local industry.

==== Hump Yards ====

* Haslet, Texas – Alliance Yard
* Los Angeles, California – Hobart Yard
* Memphis, Tennessee
* Oakland, California – Oakland International Gateway
* Omaha, Nebraska - Gibson Yard
* Seattle, Washington – Seattle International Gateway (SIG) Intermodal Facility

===Routes===
* The Northern Transcon runs between Seattle and Chicago. The route is a combination of parts of the old Great Northern, the Northern Pacific, and the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway.
* The Southern Transcon runs between Los Angeles and Chicago. The 2006 &quot;BNSF Annual Report&quot; states: &quot;We also added about 33 miles of second main track on our main line between Chicago and Los Angeles. All but of this high-volume route were double track, as of the end of 2006. Last year, we ran 100 trains per day on this expanded main line, compared with 60 per day in 2000.&quot; Technically, it is not double tracked in mid-Kansas where two routes are used: Mulvane to Wichita to Newton to Emporia for primarily eastbound traffic; Emporia to El Dorado to Augusta to Mulvane for primarily westbound traffic. In 2008, BNSF completed nearly of a third main track through Cajon Pass in Southern California, increasing capacity on the transcontinental main route between Chicago and Los Angeles from 100 to 150 trains per day. BNSF started adding a second main track in Abo Canyon (east of Belen, New Mexico) the largest bottleneck on the Transcon with grading in 2008–2009, bridges in 2010 and signal work in late 2010 or early 2011. Approximately of rock need to be excavated, mostly by blasting. The 2008 &quot;BNSF Annual Report&quot; states: &quot;Following completion of the Abo Canyon project scheduled in 2011, our 2,200‑mile [3,540 km] Transcontinental Corridor between Southern California and Chicago will have only about 30 miles [48 km] of single track.&quot;
* The Powder River Basin supplies forty percent of the coal in the United States. The 2008 &quot;BNSF Annual Report&quot; states that the quadruple track project was completed.

===Operating divisions===
The BNSF system is divided into 13 divisions grouped into three regions. Each division includes numerous subdivisions, normally comprising a single main line and branches. A fourteenth division, Colorado, has been consolidated with the Powder River Division, except for the Casper and Cody Subdivisions, which were transferred to the Montana Division.
===Passenger train service===
BNSF directly operates the BNSF Railway Line for Metra in Chicago and the Sounder in the Puget Sound Region using BNSF-supplied crews in addition to running over its rails. Metra&#x27;s fleet includes cars originally purchased by BNSF predecessor Chicago Burlington &amp; Quincy with letterboards above the doors; some have the restored &quot;BURLINGTON&quot; lettering, while others read &quot;BNSF Railway&quot;. Other Metra cars assigned to BNSF have the BNSF &quot;swoosh&quot; logo next to the door.

The company&#x27;s network also hosts other commuter trains, including Metrolink in Southern California and the Northstar Line in Minneapolis. The line used by New Mexico Rail Runner Express was sold in 2005 to the state of New Mexico, but BNSF retained all freight rights on the line and operates freight trains as needed. Amtrak routes that use BNSF rails include the &quot;Amtrak Cascades&quot;, &quot;California Zephyr&quot;, &quot;Carl Sandburg&quot;, &quot;Coast Starlight&quot;, &quot;Empire Builder&quot;, &quot;Heartland Flyer&quot;, &quot;Illinois Zephyr&quot;, &quot;Lincoln Service&quot;, &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot;, &quot;San Joaquin&quot;, &quot;Southwest Chief&quot;, &quot;Sunset Limited&quot;, and &quot;Texas Eagle&quot;.

After the 2015 Oxnard train derailment, BNSF loaned 40 of their AC4400CWs to Metrolink while their Rotem cab cars received upgrades. These 40 units were converted to PTC. The locomotives have since been returned after the cab cars went back into service.

Although it does not have a steam program like the Union Pacific, the BNSF has allowed for the Southern Pacific 4449, St. Louis–San Francisco 1522, Santa Fe 3751, Santa Fe 2926, Spokane, Portland and Seattle 700 and Milwaukee Road 261 steam locomotives to operate excursions over their rails.

===Safety===
BNSF has received E.H. Harriman Award for safety multiple times. But a number of accidents and incidents have occurred on the railway since its inception.

As one of the leading supporters of the Operation Lifesaver program to promote safety at railway crossings and rights-of-way, BNSF Railway established a grade-crossing closure program in 2000. This program, in which BNSF works with communities and landowners to identify unnecessary or redundant crossings, has helped close more than 2,900 of BNSF&#x27;s railway crossings throughout the United States. BNSF has been the industry leader in lowering the number of grade-crossing collisions.

BNSF contracts with News Link, a small business in Lincoln, Nebraska, to publish employee newsletters focused on safety for some of the railroad&#x27;s divisions and shops. These newsletters vary in length from four to 28 pages, published ranging from monthly to quarterly.

In 2014, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ordered BNSF to pay over $526,000 to workers who had been terminated in 2010 and 2011 in contravention of provisions of the Federal Railroad Safety Act protecting whistleblowers after they revealed workplace injuries at the terminal in Havre, Montana.

In August 2016, a &quot;huge number&quot; of used hypodermic drug needles were found along a BNSF railroad bridge between the University Park and St. Johns neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon, that had become an encampment for the unhoused. According to a conductor: &quot;Pretty much see people down there at all hours of the night. We report them but nobody does anything.&quot;

In March 2024, BNSF furloughed 360 mechanical workers, a small fraction of the railroad&#x27;s 37,000 employees, but enough to elicit a condemning letter from the Transportation Trades Department labor coalition calling on the Federal Railroad Administrator to increase inspections. The unions maintain that these cuts will make it difficult for BNSF to finish needed repairs and inspections of its rolling stock. In a letter dated March 2024 sent to the FRA, the Shop Craft Unions at BNSF urged the Administration look at &quot;safety and maintenance issues&quot; in the railroad industry, presenting evidence of a 41% decrease in repair and maintenance departments since 2015. BNSF shippers complain that shipments to the northwestern U.S. have seen delays, most citing lack of enough crew as the reason. They also complained of high rates for secondary shuttle freight.

==== Safety culture assessment ====
In 2023, the FRA issued a safety culture report on BNSF. Regulators looked at ten areas of safety, including leadership, continuous learning, and how well safety is prioritized over other demands. The report said that BNSF is working toward a better safety culture but that it still needs to improve, particularly in communication and trust between management and employees.

One of the report&#x27;s findings concerned the difference between what BNSF leadership says about safety and how employees experience it. Some employees felt that safety sometimes takes a back seat to getting the job done, especially with mid-level managers. The report said that safety issues are not always handled the same way across the company, and that some employees felt that safety concerns were not addressed fairly. It also noted positive steps, like BNSF&#x27;s investment in safety training and efforts to promote ongoing learning.

The report gave several recommendations to help BNSF improve its safety culture, including better communication, building more trust between workers and management, and making sure safety is always the top priority. The FRA plans to monitor how BNSF responds to these recommendations.

===Equipment===
According to the 2007 &quot;BNSF Annual Report&quot;, at the end of 2007 the railway had more than 40,000 employees; 6,400 locomotives (8,359 as of 2018); and 85,338 freight cars (72,369 as of 2018).
* Broken down by specific kind of car, the BNSF owned:
** 36,439 covered hoppers
** 13,690 gondolas
** 11,428 open hoppers
** 10,470 flatcars
** 7,948 boxcars
** 4,196 refrigerated &quot;reefer&quot; cars
** 427 tank cars
** 416 automobile carriers
** 81 private/business cars 
** 324 &quot;other&quot; types of cars
* In addition, the railroad also owned:
** 3,253 domestic containers 
** 11,714 domestic chassis (Swap body) (?)
** 4,070 company service vehicles 
** 1,200 trailers
** 163 commuter passenger cars

At the end of 2007, the average age (from date of manufacture) was 15 years for the BNSF&#x27;s locomotive fleet and 14 years for the freight car fleet.

On January 24, 2006, BNSF announced a US$2.4 billion program of infrastructure upgrades for 2006. The upgrade program includes: double- and triple-tracking of track and a second mainline track through New Mexico&#x27;s Abo Canyon on the former ATSF transcontinental line; expanding the Lincoln, Nebraska, classification yard and double- and triple-tracking of track in Wyoming&#x27;s Powder River Basin region; expansions at eight of the railroad&#x27;s larger intermodal facilities, and extending many sidings and expanding and improving refueling facilities. In making the announcement, BNSF chairman Matthew K. Rose cited improvements in the company&#x27;s return on invested capital and expressed hope for continued improvement. In March 2008, the railroad was completing the triple-tracking of Cajon Pass in California, creating four tracks through the pass—three BNSF (former Santa Fe and newly installed) and one Union Pacific (former Southern Pacific).

==Paint schemes==

Most of BNSF&#x27;s high-horsepower road locomotives are painted in &quot;Heritage&quot; schemes – primarily based on BN predecessor Great Northern Railway&#x27;s colors of Omaha Orange and Pullman Green, with yellow striping and silver underframes. Since 2005, BNSF&#x27;s locomotives feature black instead of dark green paint.

Many locomotives retain their original paint schemes, but this is gradually changing, as these units are now either being retired, or rebuilt and repainted in the Heritage III and Heritage IV schemes, respectively.

The first locomotive to bear BNSF lettering was BN SD70MAC No. 9647, introduced in late August 1995, just as the Interstate Commerce Commission was approving the merger. VMV Enterprises in Paducah, Kentucky painted it in a one-of-a-kind commemorative scheme, combining Santa Fe&#x27;s &quot;Warbonnet&quot; with BN&#x27;s &quot;Executive&quot; colors of dark &quot;Grinstein green&quot; and cream. It was nicknamed the &quot;vomit bonnet&quot; by railfans. &quot;BNSF&quot; replaced &quot;SANTA FE&quot; on the front of the unit, and &quot;Burlington Northern Santa Fe&quot; was painted on the side. The locomotive has since been repainted into the standard Heritage III livery.
By January 1996, BNSF had begun painting locomotives originally ordered for BN and ATSF patched with “BNSF” on the front and sides. Then, in late May, the company introduced a new design on BN SD60M 9297, painted mainly in BN predecessor Great Northern Railway&#x27;s pre-1967 colors of orange and dark &quot;Pullman green,&quot; but also incorporating red and silver, and said to represent all major BN predecessors and Santa Fe. On the front was a new logo, placing &quot;Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway&quot; in the Santa Fe cross. Some of the striping details were different on each side, and employees voted for the simpler right-side design, which, with some minor changes, became the new scheme, replacing the BN colors. However, president and CEO Robert Krebs said the railroad was big enough for two designs, and Santa Fe&#x27;s &quot;Warbonnet&quot; (with &quot;BNSF&quot; instead of &quot;Santa Fe&quot; on the front) remained alongside the new Heritage I scheme.

On January 24, 2005, as part of its tenth-anniversary celebration, the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway was renamed BNSF Railway and adopted a new logo. By March, the logo had been applied to the sides and fronts of six ES44DCs, and on April 11, BNSF officially chose the design it had applied to No. 7701. The New Image scheme is also referred to as Heritage III.

Since 2006, BNSF&#x27;s locomotives designated for yard work or local trains have been painted in the Heritage IV scheme. Somewhat of a simplified form of the Heritage III scheme, Heritage IV is virtually identical to the original Heritage I scheme, with black instead of dark green, and the current BNSF logo.
== Lawsuits ==

=== Swinomish trespassing lawsuit ===
In 2015, BNSF was sued by the Swinomish Tribe in Washington state for violating the terms of a 1991 easement agreement between BNSF and the tribe that allows trains crossing the Swinomish Reservation to carry no more than 25 cars per day, with the tribe alleging that BNSF was running trains with four times as many cars as permitted under the easement agreement. In 2023, US District Court Judge Robert Lasnik ruled that BNSF &quot;willfully, consciously and knowingly exceeded the limitations on its right of access&quot; from September 2012 to May 2021 &quot;in pursuit of profits,&quot; finding that BNSF made a unilateral decision to increase the number of trains and cars crossing the reservation without the tribe&#x27;s consent. In June 2024, Lasnik ordered BNSF to pay $400 million to the tribe, after holding a four-day trial to determine how much in what Lasnik termed &quot;ill-gotten&quot; profit BNSF made by trespassing on the Swinomish Reservation from 2012 to 2021.

=== WildEarth Guardians and Western Watershed Project lawsuit===

In 2023, two wildlife protection organizations, WildEarth Guardians and the Western Watershed Project, brought legal action against BNSF for ignoring the Endangered Species Act and not attempting to diminish the number of grizzly bears allegedly killed by trains in Montana since 2008. The groups maintain the company has been responsible for the deaths of 63 bears in that time. BNSF has applied to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for a permit that would eliminate any penalty to the railroad for killing bears. According to the plaintiffs, the U.S. government never issued the permit and therefore the BNSF is liable.

<doc id="263484" wikidata="Q454271" url="?curid=263484" title="James Dillon (Fine Gael politician)">
<text>James Mathew Dillon (26 September 1902 – 10 February 1986) was an Irish Fine Gael politician who served as Leader of the Opposition and Leader of Fine Gael from 1959 to 1965 and Minister for Agriculture from 1948 to 1951 and 1954 to 1957. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1932 to 1969.

==Early and personal life==
Dillon was born at 2 North Great George&#x27;s Street, Dublin. He was the son of John Dillon, the last leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party (1918), and Elizabeth Mathew. He was educated at Mount St Benedict&#x27;s, in Gorey, County Wexford, University College Dublin and King&#x27;s Inns. He qualified as a barrister and was called to the Bar in 1931. Dillon studied business methods at Selfridges in London. After some time at Marshall Field&#x27;s in Chicago he returned to Ireland where he became manager of the family business known as Monica Duff&#x27;s in Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon.

In 1942, while on holiday in Carna, County Galway, he met Maura Phelan of Clonmel on a Friday. By the following Monday the two were engaged and six weeks after that, they married. He was 40, and she was 22 years of age.

==Political career==
In February 1932, Dillon was elected as an independent as one of the TDs for the Donegal constituency. In September 1932 he joined the National Centre Party, and after its merger with Cumann na nGaedheal, the new party of Fine Gael. Dillon played a key role in instigating the creation of Fine Gael and would become a key member of the party in later years. He remained as TD for Monaghan from 1937 to 1969. Dillon became deputy leader of Fine Gael under W. T. Cosgrave.

Dillon resigned from Fine Gael in 1942 over its stance on Irish neutrality during World War II. While Fine Gael supported the government&#x27;s decision to stay out of the war, Dillon urged the government to side with the Allies. A passionate anti-Nazi, Dillon described the Nazi creed as &quot;the devil himself with twentieth-century efficiency&quot;. His zeal against Hitler drew him the ire of the German Minister to Ireland Eduard Hempel, who denounced him as a &quot;Jew&quot; and &quot;German-hater&quot;. Even Éamon de Valera, then Taoiseach, was not spared the fierceness of Dillon&#x27;s rhetoric; when the Taoiseach ridiculed Dillon&#x27;s stark support for the Allies, noting this meant he had to adopt a Pro-British stance, Dillon defiantly retorted :
 In 1944, as the danger of allied defeat receded he was approached by Fine Gael to rejoin the party and offered the leadership, on condition he relinquished his views on neutrality, especially since they were no longer strategically important. He refused – ironically, had he accepted he might well have been taoiseach in 1948.

Dillon was one of the independents TD who was part of the first inter-party government (1948–1951), and was appointed Minister for Agriculture. As minister, Dillon was responsible for huge improvements in Irish agriculture. Money was spent on land reclamation projects in the areas of less fertile land while the overall quality of Irish agricultural produce increased.

Dillon rejoined Fine Gael in May 1952. He became Minister for Agriculture again in the second inter-party government (1954–1957). In 1959, Dillon became leader of Fine Gael, succeeding Richard Mulcahy. He became president of the party in 1960. In 1965, Fine Gael lost the general election to Seán Lemass and Fianna Fáil. The non-Fianna Fáil parties won 69 seats to Fianna Fáil&#x27;s 72. Having narrowly failed to become Taoiseach, Dillon stood down as Fine Gael leader after the election.

On Northern Ireland, while Dillon stood against Partition, he equally opposed any &quot;armed solution&quot; or militant nationalist policy, stating:

Dillon was a colourful contributor to Dáil proceedings and was noted for his high standard of oratory. He remained a TD until 1969, when he retired from politics. He died in Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon, on 10 February 1986, at the age of 83.

<doc id="263487" wikidata="Q107105677" url="?curid=263487" title="Trans fat regulation">
<text>Trans fat regulation, that aims to limit the amount of &quot;trans fat&quot; — fat containing &quot;trans&quot; fatty acids — in industrial food products, has been enacted in many countries. These regulations were motivated by numerous studies that pointed to significant negative health effects of trans fat. It is generally accepted that trans fat in the diet is a contributing factor in several diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer.

==History==

As early as 1956, there were suggestions in the scientific literature that &quot;trans&quot; fats could be a cause of the large increase in coronary artery disease but after three decades the concerns were still largely unaddressed. Instead, by the 1980s, fats of animal origin had become one of the greatest concerns of dieticians. Activists, such as Phil Sokolof, who took out full page ads in major newspapers, attacked the use of beef tallow in McDonald&#x27;s french fries and urged fast-food companies to switch to vegetable oils. The result was an almost overnight switch by most fast-food outlets to trans fats.

Studies in the early 1990s, however, brought renewed scrutiny and confirmation of the negative health impact of trans fats. In 1994, it was estimated that trans fats caused 20,000 deaths annually in the United States from heart disease.

Mandatory food labeling for &quot;trans&quot; fats was introduced in several countries. Campaigns were launched by activists to bring attention to the issue and change the practices of food manufacturers.

==International regulation==
The international trade in food is standardized in the Codex Alimentarius. Hydrogenated oils and fats come under the scope of Codex Stan 19. Non-dairy fat spreads are covered by Codex Stan 256-2007. In the Codex Alimentarius, trans fat to be labelled as such is defined as the geometrical isomers of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids having non-conjugated [interrupted by at least one methylene group (−CH2−)] carbon-carbon double bonds in the trans configuration. This definition excludes specifically the trans fats (vaccenic acid and conjugated linoleic acid) that are present especially in human milk, dairy products, and beef.

In 2018 the World Health Organization launched a plan to eliminate trans fat from the global food supply. They estimate that trans fat leads to more than 500,000 deaths from cardiovascular disease yearly.

===Argentina===
Trans fat content labeling is required starting in August 2006. Since 2010, vegetable oils and fats sold to consumers directly must contain only 2% of trans fat over total fat, and other food must contain less than 5% of their total fat. Starting on 10 December 2014, Argentina has on effect a total ban on food with trans fat, a regulation that could save the government more than US$100 million a year on healthcare.

===Australia===
The Australian federal government has indicated that it wants to pursue actively a policy to reduce trans fats from fast foods. The former federal assistant health minister, Christopher Pyne, asked fast food outlets to reduce their trans fat use. A draft plan was proposed, with a September 2007 timetable, to reduce reliance on trans fats and saturated fats.

, Australia&#x27;s food labeling laws do not require trans fats to be shown separately from the total fat content. However, margarine in Australia has been mostly free of trans fat since 1996.

===Austria===
Trans fat content limited to 4% of total fat, 2% on products that contain more than 20% fat.

===Belgium===
The Conseil Supérieur de la Santé published in 2012 a science-policy advisory report on industrially produced trans fatty acids that focuses on the general population. Its recommendation to the legislature was to prohibit more than 2 g of trans fatty acids per 100 g of fat in food products.

===Brazil===
Resolution 360 of 23 December 2003 by the Brazilian ministry of health required for the first time in the country that the amount of trans fat to be specified in labels of food products. On 31 July 2006, such labelling of trans fat contents became mandatory. In 2019 Anvisa published a new legislation to reduce the total amount of trans fat in any industrialized food sold in Brazil to a maximum of 2% by the end of 2023.

===Canada===
In a process that began in 2004, Health Canada finally banned partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs), the primary source of industrially produced trans fats in foods, in September 2018.

On 15 September 2017, Health Canada announced that trans fat will be completely banned effective on 15 September 2018. and the ban came into effect in September 2018, banning partially hydrogenated oils (the largest source of industrially produced trans fats in foods). It is now illegal for manufacturers to add partially hydrogenated oils to foods sold in or imported into Canada.

===Denmark===
In March 2003, Denmark became the first country to effectively ban artificial trans fat It limited the trans share to 2% of fats and oils destined for human consumption, a standard that partially hydrogenated oil fails. This restriction is on the &quot;ingredients&quot; rather than the final products. This regulatory approach thus made Denmark the first country in which it was possible to eat &quot;far less&quot; than 1 g of industrially produced trans fats daily, even with a diet including processed foods. One public health study concluded that Danish government&#x27;s efforts to decrease trans fat intake from 6 g to 1 g per day over 20 years is related to a 50% decrease in deaths from ischemic heart disease.

===European Union===
In 2004, the European Food Safety Authority produced a scientific opinion on trans fatty acids, surmising that &quot;higher intakes of TFA may increase risk for coronary heart disease&quot;.

From 2 April 2021 foods in the EU intended for consumers are required to contain less than 2g of industrial trans fat per 100g of fat.

=== Greece ===
Law in Greece limits content of trans fats sold in school canteens to 0.1% (Ministerial Decision Υ1γ/ΓΠ/οικ 81025/ΦΕΚ 2135/τ.Β&#x27;/29-08-2013 as modified by Ministerial Decision Υ1γ/ Γ.Π/οικ 96605/ΦΕΚ 2800 τ.Β/4-11-201).

===Iceland===
Total trans fat content was limited in 2010 to 2% of total fat content.

===Israel===
Since 2014, it is obligatory to mark food products with more than 2% (by weight) fat. The nutritional facts must contain the amount of trans fats.

=== Romania ===
On 19 August 2020, the president promulgated Law 182/2020 that limits trans fats to 2 grams per every 100 grams of fat, max. The food producers who will not conform will be fined with a sum ranging between 10,000 and 30,000 lei. It will come into force on the 1st of April 2020, and it was initiated in 2017 by Save Romania Union senator Adrian Wiener.

===Saudi Arabia===
The Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) requires importers and manufacturer to write the trans fats amounts in the nutritional facts labels of food products according to the requirements of Saudi Standard Specifications/Gulf Specifications.

Starting in 2020, Saudi Minister of Health announced the ban of trans fat in all food products due to their health risks.

===Singapore===
The Ministry of Health announced a total ban on partially-hydrogenated oils (PHOs) on 6 March 2019. The target was set to ban PHOs by June 2021, with the aim of encouraging healthy eating habits. The total ban on PHOs took effect on 1 June 2021.

===Sweden===
The parliament gave the government a mandate in 2011 to submit without delay a law prohibiting the use of industrially produced trans fats in foods, as of 2017 the law has not yet been implemented.

===Switzerland===
Switzerland followed Denmark&#x27;s trans fats ban, and implemented its own starting in April 2008.

===United Kingdom===
In October 2005, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) asked for better labelling in the UK. In the edition of 29 July 2006 of the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;, an editorial also called for better labelling. In January 2007, the British Retail Consortium announced that major UK retailers, including Asda, Boots, Co-op Food, Iceland, Marks and Spencer, Sainsbury&#x27;s, Tesco and Waitrose intended to cease adding trans fatty acids to their own products by the end of 2007.

On 13 December 2007, the Food Standards Agency issued news releases stating that voluntary measures to reduce trans fats in food had already resulted in safe levels of consumer intake.

On 15 April 2010, a &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; editorial called for trans fats to be &quot;virtually eliminated in the United Kingdom by next year&quot;.

The June 2010 National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) report &quot;Prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot; declared that 40,000 cardiovascular disease deaths in 2006 were &quot;mostly preventable&quot;. To achieve this, NICE offered 24 recommendations including product labelling, public education, protecting under–16s from marketing of unhealthy foods, promoting exercise and physically active travel, and even reforming the Common Agricultural Policy to reduce production of unhealthy foods. Fast-food outlets were mentioned as a risk factor, with (in 2007) 170 g of McDonald&#x27;s fries and 160 g nuggets containing 6 to 8 g of trans fats, conferring a substantially increased risk of coronary artery disease death. NICE made three specific recommendation for diet: (1) reduction of dietary salt to 3 g per day by 2025; (2) halving consumption of saturated fats; and (3) eliminating the use of industrially produced trans fatty acids in food. However, the recommendations were greeted unhappily by the food industry, which stated that it was already voluntarily dropping the trans fat levels to below the WHO recommendations of a maximum of 2%.

Rejecting an outright ban, the Health Secretary Andrew Lansley launched on 15 March 2012 a voluntary pledge to remove artificial trans fats by the end of the year. Asda, Pizza Hut, Burger King, Tesco, Unilever and United Biscuits are some of 73 businesses who have agreed to do so. Lansley and his special Adviser Bill Morgan formerly worked for firms with interests in the food industry and some journalists have alleged that this results in a conflict of interest. Many health professionals are not happy with the voluntary nature of the deal. Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, felt that justifying intake on the basis of average figures was unsuitable since some members of the community could considerably exceed this.

===United States===
On 11 July 2003, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a regulation requiring manufacturers to list trans fat on the Nutrition Facts panel of foods and some dietary supplements. The new labeling rule became mandatory across the board on 1 January 2006, even for companies that petitioned for extensions. However, unlike in many other countries, trans fat levels of less than 0.5 grams per serving can be listed as 0 grams trans fat on the food label. According to a study published in the Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing, without an interpretive footnote or further information on recommended daily value, many consumers do not know how to interpret the meaning of trans fat content on the Nutrition Facts panel. Without specific prior knowledge about trans fat and its negative health effects, consumers, including those at risk for heart disease, may misinterpret nutrient information provided on the panel. The FDA did not approve nutrient content claims such as &quot;trans fat free&quot; or &quot;low trans fat&quot;, as they could not determine a &quot;recommended daily value&quot;. Nevertheless, the agency is planning a consumer study to evaluate the consumer understanding of such claims and perhaps consider a regulation allowing their use on packaged foods. However, there is no requirement to list trans fats on institutional food packaging; thus bulk purchasers such as schools, hospitals, jails and cafeterias are unable to evaluate the trans fat content of commercial food items.
Critics of the plan, including FDA advisor Dr. Carlos Camargo, have expressed concern that the 0.5 gram per serving threshold is too high to refer to a food as free of trans fat. This is because a person eating many servings of a product, or eating multiple products over the course of the day may still consume a significant amount of trans fat. Despite this, the FDA estimates that by 2009, trans fat labeling will have prevented from 600 to 1,200 cases of coronary artery disease, and 250 to 500 deaths, yearly. This benefit is expected to result from consumers choosing alternative foods lower in trans fats, and manufacturers reducing the amount of trans fats in their products.

The American Medical Association supports any state and federal efforts to ban the use of artificial trans fats in U.S. restaurants and bakeries.

The American Public Health Association adopted a new policy statement regarding trans fats in 2007. These new guidelines, entitled &quot;Restricting Trans Fatty Acids in the Food Supply&quot;, recommend that the government require nutrition facts labeling of trans fats on all commercial food products. They also urge federal, state, and local governments to ban and monitor use of trans fats in restaurants. Furthermore, the APHA recommends barring the sales and availability of foods containing significant amounts of trans fat in public facilities including universities, prisons, and day care facilities etc.

In January 2007, faced with the prospect of an outright ban on the sale of their product, Crisco was reformulated to meet the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) definition of &quot;zero grams trans fats per serving&quot; (that is less than one gram per tablespoon, or up to 7% by weight; or less than 0.5 grams per serving size) by boosting the saturation and then diluting the resulting solid fat with unsaturated vegetable oils.

In 2010, according to the FDA, the average American consumed 5.8 grams of trans fat per day (2.6% of energy intake). Monoglycerides and diglycerides are not considered fats by the FDA, despite their nearly equal calorie per weight contribution during ingestion.

On 7 November 2013, the FDA issued a preliminary determination that trans fats are not &quot;generally recognized as safe&quot;, which was widely seen as a precursor to reclassifying trans fats as a &quot;food additive,&quot; meaning they could not be used in foods without specific regulatory authorization. This would have the effect of virtually eliminating trans fats from the US food supply. The ruling was formally enacted on 16 June 2015, requiring that within three years, by 18 June 2018 no food prepared in the United States is allowed to include trans fats, unless approved by the FDA.

The FDA agreed in May 2018 to give companies one more year to find other ingredients for enhancing product flavors or grease industrial baking pans, effectively banning trans fats in the United States from May 2019 onwards. Also, while new products can no longer be made with trans fats, they will give foods already on the shelves some time to cycle out of the market.

====State and local regulation====
Even before the federal ban, the state of California and several U.S. cities took action to reduce consumption of trans fats.

In 2005, Tiburon, California, became the first American city where all restaurants voluntarily cook with trans fat-free oils. In 2007, Montgomery County, Maryland, approved a ban on partially hydrogenated oils, becoming the first county in the nation to restrict trans fats.

New York City embarked on a campaign in 2005 to reduce consumption of trans fats, noting that heart disease is the primary cause of resident deaths. This has included a public education campaign and a request to restaurant owners to eliminate trans fat from their offerings voluntarily. Finding that the voluntary program was not successful, New York City&#x27;s Board of Health in 2006 solicited public comments on a proposal to ban artificial trans fats in restaurants. The board voted to ban trans fat in restaurant food on 5 December 2006. New York was the first large US city to strictly limit trans fats in restaurants. Restaurants were barred from using most frying and spreading fats containing artificial trans fats above 0.5 g per serving on 1 July 2007, and were supposed to have met the same target in all of their foods by 1 July 2008.

The Philadelphia City Council unanimously voted to enact a ban in February 2007. The ordinance does not apply to prepackaged foods sold in the city, but did require restaurants in the city to stop frying food in trans fats by 1 September 2007. The ordinance also contained a provision going into effect one year later that barred trans fat from being used as an ingredient in commercial kitchens. On 10 October 2007, the Philadelphia City Council approved the use of trans fats by small bakeries throughout the city.

Albany County of New York passed a ban on trans fats. The ban was adopted after a unanimous vote by the county legislature on 14 May 2007. The decision was made after New York City&#x27;s decision, but no plan has been put into place. Legislators received a letter from Rick J. Sampson, president and CEO of the New York State Restaurant Association, calling on them to &quot;delay any action on this issue until the full impact of the New York City ban is known.&quot;

San Francisco officially asked its restaurants to stop using trans fat in January 2008. The voluntary program will grant a city decal to restaurants that comply and apply for the decal. Legislators say the next step will be a mandatory ban.

Chicago also passed partial ban on oils and posting requirements for fast food restaurants.

Trans fat bans were also introduced in the state legislatures of Massachusetts, Maryland, and Vermont.

In March 2008, the Boston Public Health Commission&#x27;s Board of Health passed a regulation food service establishments from selling foods containing artificial trans fats at more than 0.5 grams per serving, which is similar to the New York City regulation; there are some exceptions for clearly labeled packaged foods and charitable bake sales.

In July 2008, California became the first state to ban trans fats in restaurants effective 1 January 2010; Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the bill into law. California restaurants are prohibited from using oil, shortening, and margarine containing artificial trans fats in spreads or for frying, with the exception of deep frying doughnuts. As of 1 January 2011, doughnuts and other baked goods have been prohibited from containing artificial trans fats. Packaged foods are not covered by the ban and can legally contain trans fats.

====2015–2018 federal phaseout====
In 2009, at the age of 94, University of Illinois professor Fred Kummerow, a trans fat researcher who had campaigned for decades for a federal ban on the substance, filed a petition with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking elimination of artificial trans fats from the U.S. food supply. The FDA did not act on his petition for four years, and in 2013 Kummerow filed a lawsuit against the FDA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, seeking to compel the FDA to respond to his petition and &quot;to ban partially hydrogenated oils unless a complete administrative review finds new evidence for their safety.&quot; Kummerow&#x27;s petition stated that &quot;Artificial trans fat is a poisonous and deleterious substance, and the FDA has acknowledged the danger.&quot;

Three months after the suit was filed, on 16 June 2015, the FDA moved to eliminate artificial trans fats from the U.S. food supply, giving manufacturers a deadline of three years. The FDA specifically ruled that trans fat was not generally recognized as safe and &quot;could no longer be added to food after 18 June 2018, unless a manufacturer could present convincing scientific evidence that a particular use was safe.&quot; Kummerow stated: &quot;Science won out.&quot;

The ban is believed to prevent about 90,000 premature deaths annually. The FDA estimates the ban will cost the food industry $6.2 billion over 20 years as the industry reformulates products and substitutes new ingredients for trans fat. The benefits are estimated at $140 billion over 20 years mainly from lower health care spending. Food companies can petition the FDA for approval of specific uses of partially hydrogenated oils if the companies submit data proving the oils&#x27; use is safe.

===Manufacturer response===
Palm oil, a natural oil extracted from the fruit of oil palm trees that is semi-solid at room temperature (15–25 degrees Celsius), can potentially serve as a substitute for partially hydrogenated fats in baking and processed food applications, although there is disagreement about whether replacing partially hydrogenated fats with palm oil confers any health benefits. A 2006 study supported by the National Institutes of Health and the USDA Agricultural Research Service concluded that palm oil is not a safe substitute for partially hydrogenated fats (trans fats) in the food industry, because palm oil results in adverse changes in the blood concentrations of LDL and apolipoprotein B just as trans fat does.

The J.M. Smucker Company, American manufacturer of Crisco (the original partially hydrogenated vegetable shortening), in 2004 released a new formulation made from solid saturated palm oil cut with soybean oil and sunflower oil. This blend yielded an equivalent shortening much like the prior partially hydrogenated Crisco, and was labelled zero grams of trans fat per 1 tablespoon serving (as compared with 1.5 grams per tablespoon of original Crisco). As of 24 January 2007, Smucker claims that all Crisco shortening products in the US have been reformulated to contain less than one gram of trans fat per serving while keeping saturated fat content less than butter. The separately marketed trans fat free version introduced in 2004 was discontinued.

On 22 May 2004, Unilever, the corporate descendant of Joseph Crosfield &amp; Sons (the original producer of Wilhelm Normann&#x27;s hydrogenation hardened oils) announced that they have eliminated trans fats from all their margarine products in Canada, including their flagship Becel brand.
