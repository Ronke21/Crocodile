<text>Perceptual mapping or market mapping is a diagrammatic technique used by asset marketers that attempts to visually display the perceptions of customers or potential customers. The positioning of a brand is influenced by customer perceptions rather than by those of businesses. For example, a business may feel it sells upmarket products of high quality, but if customers view the products as low quality, it is their views which will influence sales. Typically the position of a company&#x27;s product, product line, or brand is displayed relative to their competition. Perceptual maps, also known as market maps, usually have two dimensions but can be multi-dimensional or use multiple colours to add an extra variable. They can be used to identify gaps in the market and potential partners or merger targets as well as to clarify perceptual problems with a company&#x27;s product. So, if a business wants to find out where its brand is positioned in the market, it might carry out market research. This will help them to find out how the customers sees their brand in relation to others in the market. 

== Uses ==
Perceptual mapping enables companies to better understand their customers: the who, why, where, how and what of their behaviour.
If a business is perceived in a manner they find unsatisfactory, further research then identifies what can be done to change that. Perceptual mapping also allows businesses to see what consumers think of other brands, particularly their competitors. Regular uses of the maps can help track preferences, and see changes as they happen. Perceptual mapping can help define market segments, showing clusters of businesses differentiated by key aspects (such as higher class or number of restaurants). Within the clusters found in perceptual maps of entire industries, a business can classify potential partners or possible businesses to merge with, since the clustering of brands signifies the similarity in businesses, meaning they have corresponding attributes. It can also help identify gaps in a market where a new product or service could be introduced. 

Perceptual maps can also be used to help keep track of how a new product, such as a recently introduced smartphone, is being viewed in a specific market. It is important to see that the way a business is marketing its product is not only successful, but successful in a manner that aligns with the business’s overarching goal for positioning.

Some companies seem to have fallen out of favor with the public, such as Quicken Loans and VW. Perceptual mapping can help elicit the extent of the damage.

== Limitations ==

There are many limitations to perceptual mapping. The largest is the number of variables used. Traditionally, the map uses two variables and does not account for others, because these first two variables include the most variance. This assumption can hinder the reliability of results, as in some cases, it is not safe to assume that there are only two major factors influencing the decision of purchase for a consumer. For example, a graph may use quality of food and pricing, but not take into account other relevant variables such as the number of visits and locations. Also, there is often a blurred line between what a business can offer and what a consumer thinks the business can offer. This could be due to miscommunication, lack of knowledge, impact from social media, and so on. These untruths can influence the result, creating a slight bias in the statistics. Another limitation is data gathering. The data needed to form a perceptual map is usually obtained through surveys, and can be difficult to obtain. The range of behaviours that the map covers is also a constraint, as the limitation to two variables means that its application works mainly with purchase decisions made with little thought and effort, such as purchasing a beverage at a store or going to a fast food restaurant.

== Examples ==
Perceptual maps can have any number of dimensions but the most common is two dimensions. The first perceptual map below shows consumer perceptions of various automobiles on the two dimensions of sportiness/conservative and classy/affordable. This sample of consumers felt Porsche was the sportiest and classiest of the cars in the study (top right corner). They felt Plymouth was most practical and conservative (bottom left corner).

Cars that are positioned close to each other are seen as similar on the relevant dimensions by the consumer. For example, consumers see Buick, Chrysler, and Oldsmobile as similar. They are close competitors and form a competitive grouping. A company considering the introduction of a new model will look for an area on the map free from competitors. Some perceptual maps use different-sized circles to indicate the sales volume or market share of the various competing products.

Displaying consumers’ perceptions of related products is only half the story. Many perceptual maps also display consumers’ ideal points. These points reflect ideal combinations of the two dimensions as seen by a consumer. The next diagram shows a study of consumers’ ideal points in the alcohol/spirits product space. Each dot represents one respondent&#x27;s ideal combination of the two dimensions. Areas where there is a cluster of ideal points (such as A) indicate a market segment. Areas without ideal points are sometimes referred to as demand voids.

A company considering introducing a new product will look for areas with a high density of ideal points. They will also look for areas without competitive rivals. This is best done by placing both the ideal points and the competing products on the same map.

Some maps plot ideal vectors instead of ideal points. The map below displays various aspirin products as seen on the dimensions of effectiveness and gentleness. It also shows two ideal vectors. The slope of the ideal vector indicates the ratio of the two dimensions preferred by those consumers within that segment. This study indicates that there is one segment that is more concerned with effectiveness than harshness, and another segment that is more interested in gentleness than strength.

== Other types of mapping ==
=== Spidergrams ===
Spidergrams are an alternative to perceptual mapping that similarly are visual marketing tools; however, spidergrams also request customers to rate attributes.

=== Multidimensional perceptual maps ===

Traditional perceptual maps are built with two visual dimensions (X- and Y-axis). Multidimensional perceptual maps are built with more dimensions visualised as profile charts in small map regions, and then items are mapped to the regions by their similarity to the vectors that represent the region. A common technique to construct this kind of multidimensional perceptual maps is the self-organizing map. This helps pinpoint more variables, allowing for more in-depth research into what influences the consumer. This means that the perceptual map can be applied beyond low-involvement purchases, and also helps with identification of segments in a market.

=== Intuitive maps ===
Perceptual maps need not come from a detailed study. There are also intuitive maps (also called judgmental maps or consensus maps) that are created by marketers based on their understanding of their industry. These are limited by not being based on consumer data.

When detailed marketing research studies are done methodological problems can arise, but at least the information is coming directly from the consumer. An assortment of statistical procedures can be used to convert the raw data collected in a survey into a perceptual map. Preference regression will produce ideal vectors. Multi dimensional scaling will produce either ideal points or competitor positions. Factor analysis, discriminant analysis, cluster analysis and logit analysis can also be used. Some techniques are constructed from perceived differences between products, others from perceived similarities, and still others from cross price elasticity of demand data from electronic scanners.

==Modern techniques==

Marketers can reveal shoppers&#x27; collective perceptual map with increasing precision and detail by aggregating and analysing their data; this is done, for example, in the smartphone and laptop industries.

Furthermore, they can be used in non-commercial applications, such as identifying factors involved in dangerous driving.

<text>Sastrugi, or zastrugi, are features formed by the erosion of snow by wind. 
They are found in polar regions, and in snowy, wind-swept areas of temperate regions, such as frozen lakes or mountain ridges. 
Sastrugi are distinguished by upwind-facing points, resembling anvils, which move downwind as the surface erodes. 
These points usually lie along ridges parallel to the prevailing wind; they are steep on the windward side and sloping to the leeward side. Smaller irregularities of this type are known as ripples (small, ~10 mm high) or wind ridges.

Large sastrugi are troublesome to skiers and snowboarders. Traveling on the irregular surface of sastrugi can be very tiring and can risk breaking equipment; ripples and waves are often undercut, and the surface is hard and unforgiving, with constant minor topographic changes between ridge and trough.

== Etymology ==
The words &quot;sastrugi&quot; and &quot;zastrugi&quot; are Russian-language plurals; the singular is &quot;zastruga&quot;. The form &quot;sastruga&quot; started as the German-language transliteration of the Russian word заструга (plural: заструги).

A Latin-type analogical singular &quot;sastrugus&quot; is used in various writings on exploration of the South Pole, including Robert Falcon Scott&#x27;s expedition&#x27;s diaries and Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s &quot;The Heart of the Antarctic&quot;.

== Formation mechanism ==
Under the action of steady wind, free snow particles accumulate and drift like the sand grains in barchan dunes, and the resulting drifting snow shapes are also popularly referred to as &quot;barchans&quot;. Inuit of Canada call them &quot;kalutoqaniq&quot;. When winds slacken, the drifted formations consolidate via sublimation and recrystallization. Subsequent winds erode kalutoqaniq into the sculptured forms of sastrugi. Inuit call large sculpturings &quot;kaioqlaq&quot; and small ripples &quot;tumarinyiq&quot;. Further erosion may turn &quot;kaioqlaq&quot; back into drifting &quot;kalutoqaniq&quot;. An intermediate stage of erosion is &quot;mapsuk&quot;, an overhanging shape. On the windward side of a ridge, the base erodes faster than the top, producing a shape like an anvil tip pointing upwind.

== On sea ice ==

Sastrugi are more likely to form on first-year sea ice than on multiyear ice. First-year ice is smoother than multiyear ice, which allows the wind to pass uniformly over the surface without topographic obstructions. Except during the melt season, snow is dry and light in climates cold enough for sea ice, allowing the snow to be easily blown and create sastrugi parallel to the wind direction. The locations of sastrugi are fixed by March in the northern hemisphere and may be linked to the formation of melt ponds. Melt ponds are more likely to form in the depressions between sastrugi on first-year ice.

<doc id="264943" wikidata="Q743928" url="?curid=264943" title="La Femme Nikita (film)">
<text>La Femme Nikita, also called Nikita in France, is a 1990 French-language action thriller film written and directed by Luc Besson. The film stars Anne Parillaud as the title character, a criminal who is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for murdering policemen during an armed pharmacy robbery. Her government handlers fake her death and recruit her as a professional assassin. After intense training, she starts a career as a killer, where she struggles to balance her work with her personal life. She shows talent at this and her career progresses until a mission in an embassy goes awry.

Besson has said that he wrote Nikita with Parillaud, then his romantic partner, in mind. The film was considered a surprise hit. Roger Ebert called it a &quot;smart, hard-edged, psycho-romantic thriller&quot; in his review. Janet Maslin wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;&quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; combines hip violence, punk anomie, lavish settings and an old-fashioned paean to the power of love.&quot;

It was remade as &quot;Black Cat&quot; (1991) in Hong Kong, &quot;Point of No Return&quot; (1993) in Hollywood, and in Bollywood as &quot;Kartoos&quot; (1999). Two English-language television series were produced based on the film, &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; (1997–2001) and &quot;Nikita&quot; (2010–2013).

==Plot==

Nikita is a nihilistic teenage junkie and tomboy who commits her life to anarchy, drugs, and violence. One night, she participates in the robbery of a pharmacy owned by a friend&#x27;s parents. The robbery erupts into a gunfight with local police, and her accomplices are killed. Suffering severe withdrawal symptoms, she murders a police officer. Nikita is arrested, tried, and convicted of murder, and is sentenced to life in prison.

In prison, government officials fake her death, making it appear that she has committed suicide, and remove her from prison. She awakens in a nondescript room, where a well-dressed, hard-looking man named Bob tells her that, although officially dead and buried, she is in the custody of a shadowy government agency known as &quot;the Centre&quot; (possibly part of the DGSE). She is given the choice of becoming an assassin, or of occupying &quot;row 8, plot 30&quot;, her fake grave. After some resistance, she chooses the former and gradually proves to be a talented killer. She is taught computer skills, martial arts, and firearms. One of her trainers, Amande, transforms her from a degenerate drug addict to a beautiful femme fatale, more feminine, having her grow her hair, dress in short skirts and dresses with heels and pantyhose. Amande implies that she also was rescued and trained by the Centre.

Nikita&#x27;s initial mission, killing a foreign diplomat in a crowded restaurant and escaping from his well-armed bodyguards to the Centre, doubles as the final test in her training. She graduates and begins life as a sleeper agent in Paris (under the name Marie). After meeting Marco in a supermarket, the two develop an intimate relationship, although he knows nothing of her real work. Marco is curious about her past and why she has no family or other friends. Nikita invites Bob to dinner as &quot;Uncle Bob&quot;. He tells stories about &quot;Marie&quot;&#x27;s imaginary childhood and gives the couple tickets for a trip to Venice, purportedly as an engagement gift.

Nikita and Marco go on the trip. As they prepare to make love after arrival, the phone rings. She thinks it&#x27;s the room service they just ordered, but it is instructions for her next job. Her room is perfectly located for her to shoot the target. She goes to the bathroom, supposedly to take a bath, and as she prepares the rifle, Marco tries to talk to her through the door. The instructions about her target take longer than expected and she can&#x27;t answer him. She finally shoots her target but barely conceals the rifle before Marco walks in, against her wishes. Nikita is distraught that her work has caused them difficulties.

Still, her career as an assassin goes well until a document-theft mission in an embassy goes awry. Back in Paris, the Centre sends in Victor &quot;The Cleaner&quot;, a ruthless operative, to salvage the mission and destroy all the evidence of the foul-up. When another operative is killed by Victor, Nikita is assigned to take his place. They nearly complete the mission before it goes bad. Victor takes on a bunch of guards before being fatally wounded, but drives Nikita to safety before succumbing to his wounds.

Marco reveals that he has discovered Nikita&#x27;s secret life, and, concerned over how her activities are affecting her psychologically, persuades her to disappear. Upon discovering that she abandoned the Centre, Bob goes to their apartment and meets with Marco. When Bob says that Nikita is at risk because she still has the documents taken from the embassy, Marco hands them over. The two men agree that they will both miss Nikita.

==Cast==

* Anne Parillaud as Nikita
* Jean-Hugues Anglade as Marco
* Tchéky Karyo as Bob
* Jeanne Moreau as Amande
* Jean Reno as Victor &quot;The Cleaner&quot;
* Jacques Boudet as The Chemist
* Philippe Leroy as Grossman
* Jean Bouise as embassy attaché

(As this was Bouise&#x27;s last film and he had starred in previous films by this director, Besson dedicated &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; to him.)

==Production==
Besson said he wrote the script for Parillaud to star as Nikita, but purposely wrote it against type so people wouldn&#x27;t say she was playing herself. “Anne is shy, with brown glasses,” he told The Los Angeles Times. She&#x27;s “an intellectual who’d never held a weapon before. I didn’t write this part &quot;for&quot; her, but &quot;against&quot; her so people wouldn’t say she’s playing herself. When Anne read the script, she said, ‘You see me like this?’ ‘No,’ I said. ‘But you pretend to be an actress. Do it.’ ”

During the film production, Besson and Parillaud, then a couple and parents to their young daughter, Juliette, lived apart. One stayed at home with Juliette, while the other stayed in a hotel. They would switch every couple of weeks. Besson explained: “I needed to love the character of Nikita in order to shoot,” he says, “and to come back to the same girl at night and ask her to pass the salt breaks all the magic. This way, there were no fights at night that left us angry the next day. Every morning, it was such a pleasure to see her and film her.”

Based on the success of &quot;Le Grand Bleu&quot;, Gaumont agreed to finance &quot;Nikita&quot; without having seen a script. &quot;Nikita&quot; cost 39 million francs to make, and was a co-production between Besson&#x27;s company Les Films du Loup, Gaumont, and Cecchi Gori Group Tiger Cinematographica.

==Release==
&quot;Nikita&quot; premiered in Paris at the Grand Rex on 21 February 1990. On its first week in Paris, the film had 113,900 spectators. By the year 2000, the film had 828,867 spectators in Paris.

Following the premiere, the film was distributed to 15 towns in France, with Besson to promote it and have discussions with audiences after the screenings. Other cast and crew members on the tour included Éric Serra, Anne Parillaud, Jean-Hugues Anglade and occasionally Tchéky Karyo. The film had 3,787,845 spectators in France by 2000. It was the second highest-grossing film in France for 1990, but was not as popular as Besson&#x27;s previous film &quot;The Big Blue&quot; (1988).

After &quot;Nikita&quot;&#x27;s release in France, it was released in over 95 countries. Gaumont handled the sales of distribution rights separately; distribution rights were sold to Columbia Pictures and the remake rights were sold to Warner Bros. &quot;Nikita&quot; was shown in Montreal, Canada in 1990. The film was very popular in Montreal, where distributor Didier Farre noted that the film was beaten only by &quot;Bird on a Wire&quot; and &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot; in June 1990. In Britain, the film became the highest weekly box office ever for a French film, and it was also popular in the box office in Italy and Japan.

It was released in the United States in 1991. The film had a six-month theatrical run in the United States where it reached an audience of 1.15 million. It was considered a surprise hit, or &quot;a fairytale,&quot; as Besson said. By the end of the year, the film was the third highest-grossing French film production in the United States. Besson thought that the film was inappropriately promoted in the United States, saying that &quot;Nikita is an action film but was released in American art houses. &quot;The Big Blue&quot; has the same problem, released in the United States as an intellectual work, and attracting the wrong audience.&quot;

==Reception==
In France, the press reception to the film was mixed. Monthly film journals were more favourable, while the more serious journals were predominantly negative. Reviews from &quot;Le Nouvel Observateur&quot;, &quot;Libération&quot;, &quot;Le Figaro&quot; and &quot;Le Journal du Dimanche&quot; gave the film positive reviews, where they all appreciated Besson&#x27;s &quot;film noir&quot; styled film and were surprised at Parillaud&#x27;s acting in a demanding role. In contrast, the film was dismissed in reviews from &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;événement du jeudi&quot;, &quot;Le Monde&quot;, &quot;Le Parisien&quot;, and &quot;La Croix&quot;, who found the film resembled a commercial advertisement visually and psychologically had the depth of a comic strip.

Speaking of the film&#x27;s critical reception in France, Besson noted he would not talk to the press, saying he would want to &quot;count on them to help me, to help me evaluate my own work&quot;. He noted that &quot;critics should be looking towards the future, but in France, all they want to talk about is the past.&quot;

Besson further said:

I don&#x27;t have much belief in the sincerity of critics, I believe in the sincerity of someone who goes to a film, pays his ticket and comes out saying what he thinks because he has nothing to gain by doing so. The critics defend an ideology, their age, their profession, a lot of things that don&#x27;t interest me.

Paris critic Marc Esposito of &quot;Studio&quot; responded to Besson&#x27;s statements, describing Besson as someone who &quot;thinks he&#x27;s a nice guy, and everyone around him is evil. We are all guilty of not adoring Luc Besson.&quot;

The film received favourable reviews outside France. On Metacritic, the overall score from 16 critics is 65 out of 100, indicating &quot;Generally Favorable reviews&quot;. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 90% based on 48 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;A zany out-of-control thriller that gives lead Anne Parillaud a big character arc and plenty of emotional room to work in&quot;. A number of critics, including Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, positively reviewed the film.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Parillaud won the César Award for Best Actress and the David di Donatello Award for Best Foreign Actress in 1991. Marc Duret was nominated for a César Award for Most Promising Actor for his portrayal of Rico.

==Aftermath and influence==
When asked about a follow-up to &quot;Nikita&quot;, Anne Parillaud said that she was not interested in a sequel. She said: &quot;If the film was a failure, would you have had anything more to say about her? No. Of course not.&quot;

===Remake===

&quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; was remade in Hong Kong as the action film &quot;Black Cat&quot; directed by Stephen Shin in 1991.

It was remade in Hollywood as &quot;Point of No Return&quot; by John Badham in 1993. This was part of a trend in the late 1980s and early 1990s for Hollywood to remake French films. &quot;Daily Variety&quot; noted that between 1987 and 1993, Hollywood remade seventeen contemporary French films, which had been released in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. The remakes were generally initiated by the French films and, given the size of the American market, often make more money for their directors as American adaptations than they do as original films in France.

===TV series===

A Canadian TV series based on the film, titled &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot;, premiered in 1997. It was produced in Canada by Fireworks Entertainment. The developer Joel Surnow, who described himself as &quot;devotee of Besson&#x27;s film&quot;, has repeatedly said in interviews that the series is modelled explicitly after Besson&#x27;s film and not the American remake. He said that he had never seen &quot;Point of No Return&quot;.

The premiere episode of the series borrows scenes from Besson&#x27;s film, with &quot;Variety&quot; noting that it was a scene-by-scene re-creation of the kitchen restaurant scene. Several lead roles in the series parallel those of the film: Roy Dupuis plays Nikita&#x27;s trainer Michael, who was called Bob in Besson&#x27;s film, and Alberta Watson is Madeline, who is similar to the character played by Jeanne Moreau in Besson&#x27;s film.

In 2010, The CW picked up a new series, &quot;Nikita&quot;, with Maggie Q as a Nikita who has gone rogue.

<text>Ingrid Ylva ( – –1255) was a Swedish noblewoman, the wife of Magnus Minnesköld of Bjälbo and the mother of regent Birger Jarl. The exact years of her birth and death are unclear; a traditional year quoted for her death is 26 October 1252; it is also considered, though, that this was the date of her burial, and that she had actually died in 1251.

==Biography==
According to Olaus Petri, she was the daughter of Sune Sik. She was married to Magnus Minnesköld of Bjälbo, possibly as his second wife. Several of his sons, born or raised by Ingrid Ylva, would come to hold positions of power when grown: Eskil became lawspeaker in Västergötland, Karl and both became bishops of Linköping and Birger became Jarl of Sweden, and later had his son elected king.

As a widow, in –1210, she most likely managed her estates in Bjälbo as the head of the family, due to her sons being minors. She attended the church from her favourite place in the church tower, to which she had once donated a bell; according to tradition, she often lived in this tower during insecure times. In 1234, her son Birger married Princess Ingeborg Eriksdotter of Sweden, and in 1250, he became regent and father of the king. It remains unclear if Ingrid Ylva was still alive at this point, though it is believed that she was. However, she does not seem to have played any part at the royal court, and probably preferred to stay within her estates. She is said to have married again, to an unnamed man with whom she had a son, Elof Vingad Pil, while other sources claim she remained unmarried.

== Ingrid Ylva in legend ==

Ingrid Ylva is known in various legends, and possibly in her time, as a so-called white witch; she was said to be able to master magic, which she used for good purposes and for her family&#x27;s good fortune. A lot of stories were told about her magical skills. One legend said that once, when Bjälbo was subjected to a surprise attack from the enemies of the family, Ingrid Ylva rushed to the top of the church tower, and, from there, she ripped open a pillow full of feathers which spread across the land and turned into knights in armour. These magical stories were far from slander: in the 13th century, the witch trials were hundreds of years in the future, magic was not illegal and the ability to master magic was considered a great and admirable skill; there was a clear separation between white and black magic; and not even black magic was yet connected to the Devil or punishable by death, as it would become later. Her name was widely known long before her son became regent, and her alleged magical skill was highly admired.

She was widely regarded for her ability to foretell the future. Legend claims, that on her deathbed she predicted that her line would succeed to the Swedish throne, as long as her head was held high. Legend says, that because of this, her son, the regent, buried her standing upright, inside the tower with which she had had such a close relationship.

<text>Detroit Lake is a reservoir impounded by the Detroit Dam on the North Santiam River southeast of Salem, Oregon, United States.
The lake is adjacent to Oregon Route 22 near the city of Detroit.
This mesotrophic lake stores water for use by the city of Salem and other nearby communities.

==History==

Detroit Lake is situated over a historical road bed of the former Oregon Pacific Railroad. This route was built by Colonel T. Egenton Hogg as a proposed transcontinental railroad. Because of a lack of funding, the line terminated in Idanha, southeast of the lake. Idanha had rail service until the 1950s, when the track was removed for installation of the Detroit and Big Cliff reservoirs. Detroit Lake was created in 1953 after the completion of the dam. Part of the Willamette Valley Projects, the lake was intended primarily for flood control and power generation but has become one of the major recreation resources in western Oregon.

==Details==
The reservoir has a capacity of of water when full and in the summer when drawn down. Located in the North Santiam Canyon, the long lake has shoreline of when full. One swimming opportunity is at the Mongold Day-Use Area (an Oregon State Park).
Detroit Lake is stocked by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife with 125,000 catchable rainbow trout along with fingerling rainbow, kokanee and chinook salmon. 
A self-sustaining population of brown bullhead catfish resides in the lake.

Detroit Lake offers year-round fishing in still water and not in or near the rivers and streams. It is one of 32 lakes federally designated for recreation, managed by the United States Forest Service.
The lake serves many purposes including flood control, water conservation, and recreation.

There are many camping and recreation opportunities at Detroit Lake. In 2009, a new winter boat ramp was constructed, making it possible to launch a boat safely during the winter months when other ramps are on dry ground.

==Water levels==
The water level fluctuates with snow pack, precipitation, and the water consumption of Salem, and surrounding areas. At low pool, it has a surface elevation of ; at the full pool season—typically May 1 to September 1—it can raise up to a water elevation of .

In 2015 and 2016 low water levels in the reservoir impacted recreation, the operation of marinas and the economy in the Santiam Canyon.

<text>Sune Sik, (born c. 1154), was allegedly a Swedish prince. According to Olaus Petri, he would have been a younger son of King Sverker I of Sweden and father of Ingrid Ylva.
In surviving contemporary documents one &quot;Sune Sik&quot; can be found who lived much later. That Sune Sik made a donation to Vreta Abbey as late as in 1297. He might have ordered a restoration of a chapel in which he eventually was interred, and later Cistercian tradition may then have turned him into a prince. This has caused some historians to view Olaus Petri&#x27;s account of him as unreliable.

Sune Sik, as a son of King Sverker, is counted by other Swedish historians as a person of history and the man buried at Vreta (see photo). According to 18th-century Swedish Master of Philosophy Magnus Boræn, Sune was also Duke of Östergötland (at a time when the use of such a title is not known in Sweden).

<text>&quot;&quot; () is the national anthem of Ecuador. The lyrics were written in 1865 by poet Juan León Mera, under request of the Ecuadorian Senate; the music was composed by Antonio Neumane. However, it was not officially adopted by the Congress until September 29, 1948.

The anthem consists of a chorus and six verses, of which only the second verse and the chorus (before and after the verse) are actually sung. The verses are marked by a strong anti-Spanish sentiment and narrate the failed 1809 uprising against Bonapartist Spain and the 1820–1822 Ecuadorian War of Independence.

==History==
From 1830 to 1832, José Joaquín de Olmedo wrote a national anthem (chorus and four verses) as an homage to the nascent Ecuadorian state. This composition, suggested by General Juan José Flores, was not set to music and did not gain popularity. In 1833, a hymn titled &quot;Canción Ecuatoriana&quot; (), of six verses, was published in the &quot;Gaceta del Gobierno del Ecuador&quot; No. 125 of December 28. A composition date of 1830 was given, but most historians do not consider this definitive, because it was by an anonymous author. In 1838, a Canción Nacional (National Song), of a chorus and six verses, appeared included in the pamphlet Poesías by General Flores, which was published by the Government Press. In a later editions, there were changes to the third verse. Even so, for historians, it is the second Canción Nacional that is known.

In 1865, the Argentine musician Juan José Allende, in collaboration with the Ecuadorian Army, presented to the National Congress a musical project for the lyrics by José Joaquín de Olmedo, but it was not well received. In November of this year, at the express request of the president of the Senate, Nicolás Espinosa, the Ambateño poet Juan León Mera Martínez, who was then the secretary of the Senate, wrote and submitted the lyrics of the National Anthem. These lyrics were then sent, with Congressional approval, to Guayaquil, so that Antonio Neumane would set them to music. This is the hymn that would later be officialized as the definitive national anthem.

On January 16, 1866, the complete version of the lyrics by Juan León Mera were published in the Quiteño weekly &quot;El Sud Americano&quot;. In 1870, the national anthem premiered in the Plaza Grande (Plaza de la Independencia facing the Palacio de Gobierno), performed by the 2nd Battalion and the Compañía Lírica de Pablo Ferreti, directed by Antonio Neumane. The music was in the key of B flat major. The current introduction of 16 measures was composed by Domingo Brescia and Enrique Marconi in 1901. Today, the hymn is performed in the key of E major from 2001 onward.

In 1913, the Guayaquileño writer and diplomat Víctor Manuel Rendón submitted a new hymn with lyrics adapted from the music of Antonio Neumane, but ultimately the Legislature rejected the proposal.

On September 29, 1948, the National Congress declared Juan León Mera&#x27;s verses an official anthem.

==Lyrics==
As a full performance can last up to three minutes, in many instances only a sub-90 second rendition of the chorus is performed at public events like soccer games.

<text>A chief minister is an elected or appointed head of government of – in most instances – a sub-national entity, for instance an administrative subdivision or federal constituent entity. Examples include a state (and sometimes a union territory) in India; a territory of Australia; a province of Sri Lanka or Pakistan; a federal province in Nepal; an autonomous region of Philippines; or a British Overseas Territory that has attained self-governance. It is also used as the English version of the title given to the heads of governments of the Malay states without a monarchy.

The title is also used in the Crown Dependencies of the Isle of Man (since 1986), in Guernsey (since 2004), and in Jersey (since 2005).

In 2018 Sierra Leone, a presidential republic, created the role of an appointed chief minister, which is similar to a prime minister in a semi-presidential system. Before that, only Milton Margai had the same position between 1954 and 1958.

==Meaning and role==
The title has a similar construction and role as a first minister or minister-president but usually with a lower rank. The role has context within the Westminster system of government where a constitutional head of state (usually sub-national) is advised by ministers who usually head executive government departments (ministries). A chief minister is understood to be &quot;first among equals&quot;. They would be the chief adviser to the nominal head of their state, the chair of cabinet and leader of the main governing political party in the legislature.

<doc id="264967" wikidata="Q2241510" url="?curid=264967" title="Richeza of Poland, Queen of Sweden">
<text>Richeza of Poland (, ; – after 25 December 1156), a member of the House of Piast, was twice Queen of Sweden and once Princess of Minsk through her three marriages. Tradition describes her as unusually beautiful.

== Early life ==
Richeza was the daughter of Bolesław III Wrymouth, Duke of Poland, by his second wife, Salomea of Berg. The year of her birth is unknown, but is often assumed to be 1116.

==First marriage==
Bolesław III entered in an alliance with King Niels of Denmark against Wartislaw I, Duke of Pomerania (now in northwestern Poland and northeastern Germany). In order to seal this alliance, a marriage was arranged between Bolesław III&#x27;s daughter Richeza with Niels&#x27; eldest son Magnus the Strong. The wedding took place in Ribe around 1127. Richeza bore her husband two sons: Knud in 1129 and Niels in 1130.

As one of the heirs of his maternal grandfather King Inge I, Magnus claimed Sweden. He was recognized King of Götaland or parts thereof by the Geats (&quot;Götar&quot;) in c. 1129 after the death of his mother&#x27;s cousin King Inge II. Then Richeza became Queen consort of Sweden. However, Magnus&#x27; rule was not accepted by the Svear, another tribe to the north of the Geats, who vetoed him and elected Ragnvald Knaphövde as the new King. According to the chronicler Saxo Grammaticus, Ragnvald was murdered by supporters of Magnus, who then won the realm (&quot;imperium&quot;) as King of Sweden. However, there soon appeared another contender for the throne, Sverker I, who had his power base in Östergötland.

Richeza and her husband had their base in Denmark rather than Sweden. Alarmed by the popularity and Imperial support of his cousin Knud &quot;Lavard&quot;, Duke of Schleswig, both Magnus and his father King Niels acted against Knud, who was murdered by Magnus on 7 January 1131. Knud&#x27;s half-brother Erik rebelled against Niels and Magnus, but was defeated and took refuge in Norway, where he convinced the local nobility and the Holy Roman Emperor Lothair III to launch a retaliatory expedition against Niels. Meanwhile, Sverker I finally made the Swedes abandon Magnus in c. 1132, when he was busy with the civil war in Denmark; he then unified the country under his rule. Niels was defeated in the Battle of Fotevik (4 June 1134), and also lost his son Magnus who was slain during the battle. Niels escaped to Schleswig, where he was killed by the citizens (25 June 1134). Now a widow, Richeza returned to Poland, apparently leaving her two sons behind in Denmark.

==Second marriage==
Once in Poland, Duke Bolesław III arranged a new marriage for his daughter. Richeza remarried in 1134 or 1135, but the identity of her second husband is debated. Most commonly, he is assumed to be Prince Vsevolod Mstislavich of Novgorod.

Alternatively, he is identified as Volodar Glebovich, a member of the Rurikid dynasty, and a Prince of Minsk and Grodno, who at that time was in exile in the Polish court. The union would have been made in order to seal the alliance of Minsk and Poland against Denmark and the powerful Monomakh Kievan dynasty. During this marriage, Richeza gave birth to three children: two sons, Vladimir (later Prince of Minsk) and Vasilko (Prince of Logoysk or Lahojsk), and a daughter, Sophia, born ca. 1139/40.

Around 1145, the political advantages of the Polish-Minsk union began to disappear after the Monomach dynasty lost its hegemony among the Rurikid ruling branches. Likely this was the cause of the dissolution of the marriage of Richeza and Volodar. Richeza returned again to Poland, this time with her daughter Sophia, but left her two sons behind with her former husband. Volodar never remarried and died around 1186. She moved to Denmark when her son Knud or Canute V was enthroned in 1146.

==Third marriage==
In c. 1148, Queen Ulvhild Håkansdotter, Sverker I&#x27;s wife and Richeza&#x27;s old stepmother-in-law, died. Soon afterwards, the widowed King married Richeza, who arrived in Sweden with her daughter Sophia. The King likely married her with support from Richeza&#x27;s first husband&#x27;s allies in Götaland. The union produced one son, Bulizlaus or Burislev, who was named after his Polish maternal grandfather. The chronicles assign Sune Sik as the youngest son of Sverker I, possibly born by Richeza.

In 1150, Richeza&#x27;s oldest son Knud V, King of Jutland, took refuge in Sweden after he was expelled from Denmark by Sweyn III Grathe, King of Zealand. In this way, the marriage with Sverker I give Richeza the opportunity to help her son, and some historians assume that she partially married the Swedish King for this reason. One year later (1151), Knud asked for the help of Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony and Hartwig I, Archbishop of Bremen, but was defeated by Sweyn III&#x27;s forces. Only after the mediation of the King of the Germans Frederick Barbarossa during the Imperial Diet in Merseburg was there made a settlement between both parties: Knud V renounced his claim and was compensated by lands in Zealand, while Sweyn III was made king of Denmark. After this decision, both Knud V and Valdemar Knudsson (son of Knud Lavard, the enemy of his own father Magnus) rebelled against Sweyn III, who was expelled in 1154: Knud V and Valdemar became co-rulers of Denmark.

In 1156 Knud V married Helena, daughter of King Sverker I and his first wife Ulvhild; in consequence, Richeza became the step-mother-in-law of her own son. On Christmas Day of that year, Sverker I was murdered by a servant. When Knud V heard about the deed, he went to Sweden in order to console Richeza, but also to bring his half-sister Sophia of Minsk to Denmark to be married to Valdemar, to whom she had been betrothed since 1154. The marriage took place in 1157. On 9 August of that year, King Knud V was killed during a meeting with Valdemar I and Sweyn III. In 1158 Richeza&#x27;s second son Niels, probably a monk in Esrom Abbey, also died.

==Death and aftermath==

Richeza is known to have survived Sverker I&#x27;s death, although the facts of her later life and her date of death are unknown: a legend says that she remarried the stable master who took part in the assassination of Sverker I.

Burislev, Richeza&#x27;s son by Sverker I, is sometimes identified with Burislev, a rival claimant to the Swedish throne against Knut Eriksson after 1167. He acted in concert with another pretender Kol, but was defeated and eliminated, according to a much later source in 1169. He is believed either to have been slain by Knut&#x27;s men or to have fled to Denmark or Poland some time before 1173. However, medieval Swedish genealogies say that the claimants Kol and Burislev were in fact sons of Johan, a son of Sverker and Ulvhild. If so, the younger Burislev was given the prestigious name after his grandfather&#x27;s second marriage without actually being related to Bolesław III. The only thing we know about Richeza&#x27;s son Burislev is that his goods were inherited by his uterine sister Sophia of Minsk.

Richeza&#x27;s daughter Sophia of Minsk, Queen of Denmark by her first marriage to Valdemar I, give Richeza her only known legitimate grandchildren: the later kings Knud VI and Valdemar II of Denmark; Sophie (Countess of Orlamünde); Margareta and Maria, nuns at Roskilde; Ingeborg (the later repudiated Queen of France); Helena (Duchess of Brunswick-Luneburg) and Rikissa, named after her grandmother and who, like her, became Queen of Sweden.

<doc id="264969" wikidata="Q550032" url="?curid=264969" title="Brookhaven, New York">
<text>Brookhaven is a large suburban town in Suffolk County, Long Island, New York. With a population of 488,497 as of 2022, it is the second most populous town in New York (after Hempstead, in the adjacent Nassau County) and the third most populous community in the state.

The first settlement in what is now Brookhaven was known as Setauket. Founded as a group of agricultural hamlets in the mid-17th century, Brookhaven first expanded as a major center of shipbuilding in the 19th century. Its proximity to New York City facilitated the establishment of resort communities, followed by a post-war population boom. In the 2020 census record, Brookhaven contained 485,773 people.

The township is home to two renowned research centers, Stony Brook University and Brookhaven National Laboratory. Combined these two research centers are approximately 50% of the Town&#x27;s top ten employer&#x27;s employee count. Tourism is also a major part of the local economy. The largest traditional downtowns are located in Port Jefferson, a regional transportation hub for the Bridgeport &amp; Port Jefferson Ferry, and Patchogue. The area has long been serviced by the Long Island Rail Road.

== History ==
===Origins and etymology===
The primary known inhabitants were Algonquian-speaking Native Americans, of the Setauket and Unkechaug tribes. The first English settlers arrived around 1640, and in 1655, several purchased Brookhaven&#x27;s land from its tribal inhabitants. The latter founding year was recognized in 1976, when the Brookhaven Town Bicentennial Commission proposed setting the date on the seal to 1655 in line with this first deed of settlement of the town of Brookhaven at Setauket on April 14, 1655. Considering this founding year of 1655, Brookhaven is the fifth English township on Long Island following Southampton, Southold, Huntington, and East Hampton.
The first English settlement was named &quot;Setauket&quot; after the Native American tribe. The names &quot;Brookhaven&quot; and &quot;Setauket&quot; were initially used interchangeably to describe the village or the town. The verbal division between the smaller hamlet of Setauket and township of Brookhaven was not set until well into the 19th century. A point of confusion is the existence of the hamlet named Brookhaven, which was in fact named for the township in 1879. Other names used in the settlement&#x27;s first decades were &quot;Ashford&quot;, after Ashford, Kent, in England, and &quot;Cromwell Bay&quot;, for English Protestant leader Oliver Cromwell.

The original purchase from the native Setalcott tribe that took place in 1655 encompassed the land making up present-day Setauket, Stony Brook, and Port Jefferson. A second purchase was made by Richard Woodhull in 1664 expanded this tract eastward along the North Shore to additionally include all lands from the &quot;Old Mans&quot; area (Mount Sinai and Miller Place) to Wading River. Richard Woodhull was the direct heir of Eustace de Vesci, a British noble who was a signator of the Magna Charta. Another land purchase in the same year expanded Brookhaven to the South Shore of Long Island.

Brookhaven was integrated into the Province of New York following that colony&#x27;s establishment in 1664, and in 1666 Governor Richard Nicolls granted a patent for the town which confirmed title to the lands purchased. Governor Thomas Dongan issued a patent in 1686 which granted powers to the town and established a representative form of government. The town seal was authorized at this time. The central element of the town seal, the letter “D”, was designated to the Town of Brookhaven as its official cattle earmark by the Duke&#x27;s Laws of 1665. Although no records exist dating to the town seal&#x27;s original design plan, it is generally thought that the seal&#x27;s olive branch signified peace and the whaling tools signified the most lucrative business in the Town of Brookhaven at the time. The current seal is a redesign, retaining the original elements, but adding the Town of Brookhaven and its 1655 date of settlement.

===Colonial era===
Early English settlers farmed, fished, and hunted whales. Brookhaven was largely agrarian, with each hamlet being limited to a handful of families yet containing miles of land. This economy was supplemented in coastal sections with fishing. A major commercial center did not exist in Brookhaven until the early 19th century.

Brookhaven was founded primarily by English colonists that partook in the settlement of Southold, and was likewise under the jurisdiction of the theocratic New Haven Colony in the modern state of Connecticut. Brookhaven was transferred to the more secular Hartford-led Connecticut Colony in 1662. Following the English takeover of New Netherland in 1664, the new English colony of New York laid claim to Long Island and brought Brookhaven into its jurisdiction.

===American Revolutionary War===
During the early stages of the American Revolutionary War, Brookhaven and the rest of Long Island were captured by British forces, and many residents sided with the British as loyalists to the English crown. Nevertheless, Brookhaven had multiple episodes of celebrated American activity during the war. This included the actions of the Culper Spy Ring, a spy network working for George Washington that largely consisted of Brookhaveners working in occupied territory. Another episode was Benjamin Tallmadge&#x27;s successful raid from across Long Island to the British stronghold at the Manor St. George, wherein his raiding party rowed from Connecticut to Cedar Beach and marched across Long Island, culminating in the Battle of Fort St. George and burning of the defensive structure. A more minor skirmish occurred within the settlement of Setauket, where the British had repurposed the local Protestant church as a fortress. Gunshots were fired and some bullet holes remain within the walls of the adjacent Caroline Church.

===Development===
In the mid-19th century, several communities in Brookhaven prospered as shipbuilding ports. The most successful of those were the villages of Port Jefferson and Patchogue, which remain the township&#x27;s most bustling traditional downtowns. Whaling and cordwood industries also developed in Brookhaven.

Railroads reached Brookhaven in the mid-19th century, beginning in 1843 with trains reaching inland to Ronkonkoma. The earliest equivalent to the North Shore&#x27;s present-day Port Jefferson Branch began operation in 1873. The Bridgeport &amp; Port Jefferson Ferry has been operating between Port Jefferson and Bridgeport, Connecticut, since 1888 and was partly founded by legendary circus-master P.T. Barnum.

From the end of the late 19th century until the middle of the 20th, many communities along the North Shore and South Shore became successful resort towns. These hosted many urban residents from nearby New York City, including numerous celebrities of the era, during the summer months. Meanwhile, many rural sections across Brookhaven served as campgrounds for youth clubs.

During the Gilded Age, Brookhaven underwent some of the same changes that affected Long Island&#x27;s Gold Coast. Waterfront areas along the North Shore, including Belle Terre and Old Field, transformed from small fishing communities into fashionable and exclusive enclaves of the moneyed elite.

A variety of notable research occurred in Brookhaven around the turn of the 20th century. Inventor Nikola Tesla had a research center in Shoreham, which featured the large Wardenclyffe Tower. As of 2016, this site was being renovated as the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe. Guglielmo Marconi opened one of the world&#x27;s largest radio facilities, known as RCA&#x27;s &quot;Radio Central&quot;, in Rocky Point.

===Modern history===

In the post-war era, Brookhaven experienced a massive population boom. This was partly due to its proximity to New York City along the Long Island Rail Road and the highway system of Robert Moses. The township&#x27;s most internationally renowned institutions, Stony Brook University and Brookhaven National Lab, both date to the years following World War II.

During the mid-century, a number of major transformations were conducted by philanthropist Ward Melville in the &quot;Three Village&quot; area (The Setaukets, Stony Brook, and Old Field). Melville, an Old Field resident and owner of what later became CVS Corporation, used his fortune to transform Northwestern Brookhaven to his vision of an idealized New England–style region. To this end, he ordered the construction in 1939 of the Stony Brook Village Center, a picturesque commercial center set on village green in Stony Brook, with clapboard buildings designed to look as if they had colonial origins. In 1962, Ward Melville donated 400 acres of land for the relocation of now-named Stony Brook University from Oyster Bay.
Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) sits on the site of Camp Upton, a United States Army installation that was used as a training ground in World War I and World War II by thousands of soldiers including composer Irving Berlin. In 1946 ownership of the grounds was transferred for use by the new national laboratory, which began operating the following year. Brookhaven researchers have since made such diverse contributions as patenting Maglev, designing one of the first video games, detecting the first solar neutrinos, designing pollutant-eating bacteria, creating the first PET scan, and various contributions to particle physics. The laboratory contains the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the National Synchrotron Light Source. 

==Geography==
Brookhaven is located centrally on the geographic Long Island and extends from the North Shore to the South Shore. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (51.20%) is water. It is the largest town in New York in terms of total area, excluding water. However, there are four towns in the state with more land area: Arietta in Hamilton County, Long Lake in Hamilton County, Ohio in Herkimer County and Webb in Herkimer County.

Brookhaven is bounded by Long Island Sound to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the south, Riverhead to the northeast, Southampton to the southeast, Smithtown to the northwest, and Islip to the southwest.

A large part of Fire Island (accessible by a bridge at Smith Point) and the Great South Bay are in the town.

Bald Hill, a large hill in the hamlet of Farmingville, marks where the glacier which formed Long Island stopped. At the top of Bald Hill is a Vietnam veterans memorial. Telescope Hill, to the west of Bald Hill Cultural Park, is slightly taller at above sea level and the highest point in the town.

==Government and politics==

Patchogue was the town seat of Brookhaven until 1986, when it moved to Medford and then its current location near Bald Hill in Farmingville.

Brookhaven is led by a town supervisor and a six-member town council, which are all four-year term elected positions. Council members have been elected by district since a referendum in 2002.

Prior to 2002, the local Republican Party for the Town of Brookhaven nearly controlled the entirety of the town board for several decades, except for a four-year period in the mid-1970s when Democrats held a majority under Supervisor John Randolph.

This one-party domination, and a series of scandals, led to a tarnished reputation of local politics and accorded the nickname &quot;Crookhaven&quot;.

After the referendum was passed In 2002, Steve Fiore-Rosenfield became the first Democrat to be elected since the 1970s in 2003.

In 2005, Brian X. Foley, a Democratic county legislator, won the town supervisor race. Constance Kepert and Carol Bissonette were also elected to the town board. With the re-election of Fiore-Rosenfield the Democrats gained control of the Brookhaven town board for the first time since the 1970s.

In 2007, councilwoman Carol Bissonette chose not to pursue re-election, but to instead run for the open receiver of taxes seat. Her district, the sixth, was won by Republican Keith Romaine, returning the town to a 4-3 majority on the town board. The new majority opted to elect councilman Tim Mazzei as majority leader.

In 2008, Brian X. Foley was elected to the New York state senate. As per New York state law his seat was declared vacant, a special election was held on March 31, 2009, to replace him. Democrat Mark Lesko. defeated Majority Leader Mazzei to become Supervisor. In August 2012, Lesko chose to step down and join a tech company on Long Island. A special election was held on November 6, 2012, which was won by Republican county legislator Edward P. Romaine, who had previously served as county clerk. With Romaine&#x27;s victory and the subsequent victories of Daniel Losquadro in 2013 for the special election of highway superintendent, and Independence party member Donna Lent to town clerk, the Republican party and its endorsed allies won all townwide seats for the first time since former supervisor John Jay LaValle.

<doc id="264971" wikidata="Q505728" url="?curid=264971" title="National Anthem of El Salvador">
<text>The National Anthem of El Salvador () was adopted on 15 September 1879 and officially approved on 11 December 1953. The lyrics were written by General Juan José Cañas in 1856, with music composed by the Italian Juan Aberle in 1879.

The composition has been likened to &quot;William Tell Overture&quot; by critics.

== History ==
=== 1866 anthem ===
In 1866, at the initiative of doctor Francisco Dueñas, who at the time was President of the Republic, the first national anthem of El Salvador was created by Cuban doctor Tomás M. Muñoz, who wrote the lyrics, and Salvadoran musician Rafael Orozco, who composed the music. This national anthem was legally adopted through Executive Agreement of 8 October 1866, being published in the state newspaper &quot;El Constitucional&quot; No. 31, Volume 2, of 11 October 1866, to be officially released on 24 January 1867.

This anthem was sung until the overthrow of President Dueñas through a coup d&#x27;état in 1871.

=== 1879 anthem ===
Later, in 1879, at the initiative of then president Rafael Zaldívar, the current National Anthem of El Salvador would be created by Cañas and Aberle as authors of its lyrics and music, respectively.

Through the Executive Agreement of 3 June 1891, published in the Official Gazette No. 128, Volume 30, of 3 June 1891, and General Carlos Ezeta being then president, it was legally adopted, at the initiative of Ezeta, as a new national anthem known under the official name of &quot;El Salvador Libre&quot;, which was dedicated to the Salvadoran Armed Forces. The composition of the lyrics and music of this national anthem, which was previously officially released on 2 May 1891, was the responsibility of Italian artist Césare Georgi Vélez.

General Ezeta was overthrown in a coup d&#x27;état executed in 1894, and after his fall, the national anthem made by Cañas and Aberle was sung again in 1879, although it lacked official recognition. This situation was resolved by Legislative Decree No. 1231, of 13 November 1953, published in the Official Gazette No. 226, Volume 161, of 11 December 1953, through which the Legislative Assembly, at the request of the , officially recognised as the national anthem of El Salvador the anthem written and composed by Cañas and Aberle, respectively, and solemnly premiered on 15 September 1879 in the esplanade of the old National Palace of El Salvador, whose civic ceremony was attended by members of the presidential cabinet of that time.

== Regulation ==
All radio and television stations must air the national anthem in accordance to the law and should be played during &quot;Startup&quot; and &quot;Closedown&quot; of every stations.

== Lyrics ==
The National Anthem of El Salvador is made up of a chorus and three stanzas, although the last two have not been sung for many years, as a full performance can take more than four minutes to complete. However, this custom would only obtain official recognition through Legislative Decree No. 342, of 7 October 1992, published in the Official Gazette No. 223, Volume 317, of 3 December 1992, through the which the Legislative Assembly decided to reform Article 15 of the National Symbols Law, where it was established that the execution of the national anthem must begin with the chorus and end with the first verse. However, it has become very common to only sing the chorus, which is repeated, since it is the strongest musical part of the national anthem.

=== Spanish original ===
=== In Nawat ===
On 1 September 2009, during the inauguration of Civic Month in Suchitoto, Cuscatlán, the National Anthem was performed in Nawat by the Doctor Mario Calvo Marroquín School Centre Choir from Izalco, Sonsonate. The name of the national anthem in Nawat is (), meaning &quot;Song to Our Land&quot;.

<doc id="264973" wikidata="Q298039" url="?curid=264973" title="Empress Lü">
<text>Lü Zhi (241 BC – 18 August 180 BC), courtesy name E&#x27;xu (娥姁) and commonly known as Empress Lü () and formally Empress Gao of Han (), was the empress consort of Gaozu, the founding emperor of the Han dynasty. They had two known children, Liu Ying (later Emperor Hui of Han) and Princess Yuan of Lu. Lü was the first woman to assume the title Empress of China and paramount power. After Gaozu&#x27;s death, she was honoured as empress dowager and regent during the short reigns of Emperor Hui and his successors Emperor Qianshao of Han and Liu Hong (Emperor Houshao).

She played a role in the rise and foundation of her husband, Emperor Gaozu, and his dynasty, and in some of the laws and customs laid down by him. Empress Lü, even in the absence of her husband from the capital, killed two prominent generals who played an important role in Gaozu&#x27;s rise to power, namely Han Xin and Peng Yue, as a lesson for the aristocracy and other generals. In June 195 BC, with the death of Gaozu, Empress Lü became, as the widow of the late emperor and mother of the new emperor, Empress Dowager (皇太后, Huángtàihòu), and assumed a leadership role in her son&#x27;s administration. Less than a year after Emperor Hui&#x27;s accession to the throne, in 194 BC, Lü had one of the late Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s consorts whom she deeply hated, Concubine Qi, put to death in a cruel manner. She also had Concubine Qi&#x27;s son Liu Ruyi fatally poisoned. Emperor Hui was shocked by his mother&#x27;s cruelty and fell sick for a year, and thereafter no longer became involved in state affairs, and gave more power to his mother. As a result, Empress Dowager Lü held the court, listened to the government, spoke on behalf of the emperor, and did everything (臨朝聽政制, &quot;linchao tingzheng zhi&quot;). With the untimely death of her 22-year-old son, Emperor Hui, Empress Dowager Lü subsequently proclaimed his two young sons emperor (known historically as Emperor Qianshao and Emperor Houshao respectively). She gained more power than ever before, and these two young emperors had no legitimacy as emperors in history; the history of this 8-year period is considered and recognized as the reign of Empress Dowager Lü. She dominated the political scene for 15 years until her death in August 180 BC, and is often depicted as the first woman to have ruled China. While four women are noted as having been politically active before her—Fu Hao, Yi Jiang, Lady Nanzi, and Queen Dowager Xuan—Lü was the perhaps first woman to have ruled over united China.

== Family background and marriage to Liu Bang ==
Lü Zhi was born in Shanfu County (單父; present-day Shan County, Shandong) during the late Qin dynasty. Her courtesy name was Exu (). To flee from enemies, her father Lü Wen () brought their family to Pei County, settled there, and became a close friend of the county magistrate. Many influential men in town came to visit Lü Wen. Xiao He, then an assistant of the magistrate, was in charge of the seating arrangement and collection of gifts from guests at a banquet in Lü Wen&#x27;s house, and he announced, &quot;Those who do not offer more than 1,000 coins in gifts shall be seated outside the hall.&quot; Liu Bang (later Emperor Gaozu of Han), then a minor patrol officer (), went there bringing a single cent and said, &quot;I offer 10,000 coins.&quot; Lü Wen saw Liu Bang and was so impressed with him on first sight, that he immediately stood up and welcomed Liu into the hall to sit beside him. Xiao He told Lü Wen that Liu Bang was not serious, but Liu ignored him and chatted with Lü. Lü Wen said, &quot;I used to predict fortunes for many people but I&#x27;ve never seen someone so exceptional like you before.&quot; Lü Wen then offered his daughter Lü Zhi&#x27;s hand in marriage to Liu Bang and they were wed. Lü Zhi bore Liu Bang a daughter (later Princess Yuan of Lu) and a son, Liu Ying (later Emperor Hui of Han).

Liu Bang later participated in the rebellion against the Qin dynasty under the insurgent Chu kingdom, nominally-ruled by King Huai II. Lü Zhi and her two children remained with her father and family for most of the time during this period.

== Life during the Chu–Han Contention ==

In early 206 BC, after the fall of the Qin dynasty, Xiang Yu divided the former Qin Empire into the Eighteen Kingdoms. Liu Bang was named &quot;King of Han&quot; and given the lands in the remote Bashu region (in present-day Sichuan) as his domain. However, Liu Bang&#x27;s family, including Lü Zhi and her children, remained in Pei County, which was a territory of Xiang Yu&#x27;s kingdom of Western Chu.

Later that year, Liu Bang attacked and seized the Three Qins (three kingdoms covering the Guanzhong region) directly north of his own fief. Guanzhong was rightfully Liu Bang&#x27;s, according to an earlier promise by Emperor Yi of Chu (previously known as King Huai II of Chu) to appoint whoever conquered Guanzhong first (during the rebellion against the Qin dynasty) as king of that area. This marked the beginning of a four-year power struggle for supremacy over China between Liu Bang and Xiang Yu, from 206 BC to 202 BC, known as the Chu–Han Contention. Xiang Yu initially took no action against Liu Bang&#x27;s family. In the eighth lunar month, Liu Bang sent his followers, Wang Xi () and Xue Ou (), to meet Wang Ling () in Nanyang and fetch his family. However Xiang Yu mobilised troops to Yangxia () and prevented the Han forces from advancing.

In the summer of 205 BC, Liu Bang took advantage of the situation when Xiang Yu was occupied with suppressing rebellions in the Qi kingdom to attack and capture Western Chu&#x27;s capital of Pengcheng. Xiang Yu immediately withdrew from Qi and launched a counterattack, defeating Liu Bang&#x27;s forces at Suishui (). Lü Zhi and Liu Bang&#x27;s family were captured by Chu forces and held hostage. During this period of time, Lü Zhi started an illicit affair with Shen Yiji (), one of Liu Bang&#x27;s followers, who was also held captive together with her.

In the autumn of 203 BC, Liu Bang and Xiang Yu came to a temporary reconciliation, known as the Treaty of Hong Canal, which divided China into west and east under their Han and Western Chu domains respectively. As part of their agreement, Xiang Yu released Lü Zhi and Liu Bang&#x27;s family and returned them to Liu. Lü Zhi was given the title of &quot;Queen Consort of Han&quot; (). Liu Bang later renounced the truce and attacked Xiang Yu, eventually defeating the latter at the Battle of Gaixia in 202 BC and unifying China under his rule. Liu Bang proclaimed himself Emperor of China and established the Han dynasty. He instated Lü Zhi as his empress and their son Liu Ying as crown prince.

== As empress and paramount authority==
Even after Emperor Gaozu (Liu Bang)&#x27;s victory over Xiang Yu, there were still unstable areas in the empire, requiring the new government to launch military campaigns to pacify these regions thereafter. Gaozu placed Empress Lü Zhi and the crown prince Liu Ying (Lü Zhi&#x27;s son) in charge of the capital Chang&#x27;an and making key decisions in court, assisted by the chancellor Xiao He and other ministers. During this time, Lü Zhi proved herself to be a competent administrator in domestic affairs, and she quickly established strong working relationships with many of Gaozu&#x27;s officials, who admired her for her capability and feared her for her ruthlessness. After the war ended and Emperor Gaozu returned, she remained in power and she was always influential in many of the country&#x27;s affairs.

===Roles in the deaths of Han Xin and Peng Yue===
Lü Zhi is known for her roles in the deaths of Han Xin and Peng Yue, two of Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s subjects who contributed greatly to the founding of the Han dynasty, of whose military capabilities both she and her husband had been apprehensive.

In 196 BC, Gaozu left the capital Chang&#x27;an to suppress a revolt in Julu started by Chen Xi, the Marquis of Yangxia. A year before, Chen Xi met Han Xin before departing from Chang&#x27;an for Julu, and it was alleged that Han Xin was involved in the rebellion. Lü Zhi became wary of Han Xin, and after consulting the chancellor Xiao He, she had Xiao summon Han to meet her in Changle Palace. There, the empress had Han Xin taken by surprise, captured, and subsequently executed in a torturous manner. Lü Zhi also ordered Han Xin&#x27;s family and relatives to be put to death as well.

When Gaozu was putting down Chen Xi&#x27;s revolt, he requested reinforcements from Peng Yue but the latter claimed that he was ill and sent his subordinates to assist Gaozu instead. After Chen Xi&#x27;s rebellion was quelled, Gaozu heard rumours that Peng Yue was plotting against him too, and he had Peng arrested and stripped off his titles. Peng was demoted to the status of a commoner and exiled to the remote Qingyi County (青衣縣; in present-day Ya&#x27;an, Sichuan). During his journey to Qingyi, Peng Yue encountered Lü Zhi, who wanted to have him killed. He pleaded with her to spare his life and let him return to his hometown in Changyi (昌邑; present-day Jinxiang County, Shandong), and the empress pretended to agree. Peng Yue was brought to Luoyang, where he was subsequently executed on false charges of treason. Lü Zhi ordered Peng Yue&#x27;s body to be mutilated and had Peng&#x27;s clan exterminated as well.

===Dispute over the succession===
In his late years, Emperor Gaozu started favouring one of his younger consorts, Concubine Qi, who bore him a son, Liu Ruyi, who was instated as Prince of Zhao in 198 BC, displacing Lü Zhi&#x27;s son-in-law Zhang Ao (Princess Yuan of Lu&#x27;s husband). Gaozu had the intention of replacing Liu Ying with Liu Ruyi as crown prince, reasoning that the former was too &quot;soft-hearted and weak&quot; and that the latter resembled him more. Since Lü Zhi had strong rapport with many ministers, they generally opposed Gaozu&#x27;s decision but the emperor seemed bent on deposing Liu Ying. Lü Zhi became worried and she approached Zhang Liang for help, and the latter analysed that Gaozu was changing the succession on grounds of favouritism. Zhang Liang invited the &quot;Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang&quot;, a group of four reclusive wise men, to persuade Gaozu to change his decision. The four men promised to assist Liu Ying in future if he became emperor, and Gaozu was pleased to see that Liu Ying had their support. Gaozu told Concubine Qi, &quot;I wanted to replace (the crown prince). Now I see that he has the support of those four men; he is fully fledged and difficult to unseat. Empress Lü is really in charge!&quot; This marked the end of the dispute over the succession and affirmed Liu Ying&#x27;s role as crown prince.

== As empress dowager and Regent==
In June 195 BC, Emperor Gaozu died and was succeeded by Liu Ying, who became historically known as Emperor Hui of Han. Lü Zhi was honoured by Emperor Hui as empress dowager. She exerted more influence during the reign of her son than she had when she was empress, and she became the powerful and effective lead figure in his administration.

===Roles in the deaths of Concubine Qi and Liu Ruyi===
Lü Zhi did not harm most of Gaozu&#x27;s other consorts and treated them according to the rules and customs of the imperial family. For example, consorts who bore male children that were instated as princes were granted the title of &quot;Princess Dowager&quot; () in their respective sons&#x27; principalities. One exception was Concubine Qi, whom Lü Zhi greatly resented because of the dispute over the succession between Liu Ruyi (Qi&#x27;s son) and Liu Ying. Liu Ruyi, the Prince of Zhao, was away in his principality, so Lü Zhi targeted Concubine Qi. She had Qi stripped of her position, treated like a convict (head shaved, in stocks, dressed in prison garb), and forced to do hard labour in the form of milling rice.

Lü Zhi then summoned Liu Ruyi, who was around the age of 12 then, to Chang&#x27;an, intending to kill him together with his mother. However Zhou Chang (), the chancellor in Liu Ruyi&#x27;s principality, whom Lü Zhi respected because of his stern opposition to Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s proposal to make Liu Ruyi crown prince, temporarily protected Liu Ruyi from harm by responding to Lü Zhi&#x27;s order that, &quot;The Prince of Zhao is ill and unfit for travelling over long distances.&quot; Lü Zhi then ordered Zhou Chang to come to the capital, had him detained, and then summoned Liu Ruyi again. Emperor Hui tried to save Liu Ruyi by intercepting his half-brother before the latter entered Chang&#x27;an, and kept Liu Ruyi by his side most of the time. Lü Zhi refrained from carrying out her plans for several months because she feared that she might harm Emperor Hui as well.

One morning in the winter of 195–194 BC, Emperor Hui went for a hunting trip and did not bring Liu Ruyi with him because the latter refused to get out of bed. Lü Zhi&#x27;s chance arrived, so she sent an assassin to force poisoned wine down Liu Ruyi&#x27;s throat. The young prince was dead by the time Emperor Hui returned. Lü Zhi then had Concubine Qi killed in an inhumane manner: she had Qi&#x27;s hands and feet chopped off, eyes gouged out, ears burned, nose sliced off, tongue cut out, forced her to drink a potion that made her mute, and had her thrown into a latrine. She called Qi a &quot;human swine&quot; (). Several days later, Emperor Hui was taken to view the &quot;human swine&quot; and was shocked to learn that it was Concubine Qi. He cried loudly and became ill for a long time. He requested to see his mother and said, &quot;This is something done not by a human. As the empress dowager&#x27;s son, I&#x27;ll never be able to rule the empire.&quot; From then on, Emperor Hui indulged himself in carnal pleasures and ignored state affairs, leaving all of them to his mother, and this caused power to fall completely into her hands.

===Treatment of Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s other sons===
Around the winter of 195-194 BC, Liu Fei, the Prince of Qi, Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s eldest son born to Lady Cao (), visited Chang&#x27;an and he and Emperor Hui attended a banquet hosted by the empress dowager. Emperor Hui honoured Liu Fei as an older half-brother and treated the latter respectfully. Lü Zhi felt offended and secretly instructed her servants to pour a cup of poisoned wine for Liu Fei, and then toasted him. Just as Liu Fei was about to drink the wine, Emperor Hui realised his mother&#x27;s intention and grabbed Liu Fei&#x27;s cup as if he would drink from it. Lü Zhi immediately jumped up and knocked the cup out of Emperor Hui&#x27;s hand. Liu Fei then offered to give up an entire commandery from his principality to Lü Zhi&#x27;s daughter, Princess Yuan of Lu. Lü Zhi accepted the offer and allowed him to leave.

Lü Zhi also played a role in the death of another of Gaozu&#x27;s sons, Liu You, the Prince of Zhao. Liu You married Lü Zhi&#x27;s niece but was caught having an affair with another woman, so Lü Zhi&#x27;s niece reported to her aunt that Liu You was plotting a rebellion. Lü Zhi summoned Liu You to Chang&#x27;an and had him imprisoned and deprived of food. Liu You was afraid of committing suicide and eventually starved to death, in February 181 BC.

Lü Zhi then transferred another of Gaozu&#x27;s sons, Liu Hui, the Prince of Liang, to Zhao, and forced him to marry a daughter of Lü Chan. The Lü clan grabbed the authority of Zhao and oversaw Liu Hui, thus making Liu Hui feel restricted. Princess Lü had a favored concubine of Liu Hui poisoned to death. Liu Hui was distressed and committed suicide in fear in July 181 BC.

For the matters above, Lü Zhi was criticized for &quot;having murdered three princes of Zhao&quot;.

===Marriage proposal from Modu===
In 192 BC, Lü Zhi received a marriage proposal from the Xiongnu &quot;chanyu&quot; Modu, who wrote as follows in a letter meant to intimidate and mock her:
I&#x27;m a lonesome ruler born in marshes and raised in plains populated by livestock. I&#x27;ve visited your border numerous times and wanted to tour China. Your Majesty is now alone and living in solitude. Since both of us are not happy and have nothing to entertain ourselves, I&#x27;m willing to use what I possess to exchange for what you lack.
Lü Zhi was infuriated at the rude proposition, and in a heated court session, her generals advised her to rally an army and exterminate the Xiongnu immediately. As she was about to declare war, an outspoken attendant named Ji Bu pointed out that the Xiongnu army was much more powerful than the Chinese. At Ji Bu&#x27;s words, the court immediately fell into a fearful silence. Rethinking her plans, Lü Zhi rejected Modu&#x27;s proposition humbly, as follows:
Your Lordship does not forget our land and writes a letter to us, we fear. I retreat to preserve myself. I&#x27;m old and frail, I&#x27;m losing hair and teeth, and I struggle to maintain balance when I move. Your Lordship has heard wrongly, you shouldn&#x27;t defile yourself. Our people did not offend you, and should be pardoned. We&#x27;ve two imperial carriages and eight fine steeds, which we graciously offer to Your Lordship.
However, she continued implementing the &quot;heqin&quot; policy of marrying Han princesses to Xiongnu chieftains and paying tribute to the Xiongnu in exchange for peace between both sides.

===Emperor Hui&#x27;s marriage to Empress Zhang Yan===
In 191 BC, at Lü Zhi&#x27;s insistence, Emperor Hui married his niece Zhang Yan (Princess Yuan of Lu&#x27;s daughter) and made her empress. They did not have any children. It was alleged that Lü Zhi told Zhang Yan to adopt eight boys and have their mothers killed. There is uncertainty whether these children were Emperor Hui&#x27;s; the traditional view is that they were not, while modern historians believe that they were born to his concubines.

== As empress dowager: grandmother and an acting emperor==
Emperor Hui died in 188 BC and was succeeded by Emperor Qianshao, one of the children Empress Zhang adopted. Empress Dowager Lü closely monitored and controlled the imperial court and kept the whole army firmly in her hands, thus maintaining power more strongly than before. His death and the succession of an immature child left power completely and solely in the hands of Empress Dowager Lü, and as a regent, legitimized her as the first female absolute ruler in Chinese history to do so exclusively. Lü Zhi&#x27;s position as regent was first recorded in the official history of Ban Gu in the Book of Han: As grandmother of the infant emperor, Lü Zhi retained her title as Empress Dowager and never claimed the title as Grand Empress Dowager. As a result, she played the role of an emperor and de facto filled the empty throne. She addressed herself as &quot;Zhen&quot; (), a first-person pronoun reserved for use by the emperor after the Qin dynasty. Officials addressed her as &quot;Bixia, Imperial Majesty&quot; (), an honorific used when addressing the emperor directly, not &quot;Dianxia, Imperial Highness&quot; (), an honorific used when addressing the empress or empress dowager directly. The edicts (敕, chi) she issued were referred to as Sheng Zhe (聖制), which were the personal orders of the emperor. Conventional historians do not consider Emperor Qianshao a true sovereign, so he is usually omitted from the list of emperors of the Han dynasty.

Emperor Gaozu had previously decreed that no non-imperial clan members could become princes (not including the vassal kings), a rule that Lü Zhi herself had a hand in creating. In spite of this, Lü Zhi attempted to install some of her kinsmen as princes. The Right Chancellor Wang Ling () opposed her decision but the Left Chancellor Chen Ping and general Zhou Bo accepted this move. When Wang Ling rebuked Chen Ping and Zhou Bo in private for going against Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s law, they rationalized that their compliance with the empress dowager&#x27;s wishes was necessary to protect the empire and the Liu clan. Lü Zhi promoted Wang Ling to the position of Grand Tutor () but the latter claimed that he was ill and declined, so she ordered him to return to his marquisate (Wang Ling held the title of Marquis of Anguo). Lü Zhi then appointed Chen Ping as Right Chancellor and her illicit lover Shen Yiji () as Left Chancellor.

Lü Zhi then proceeded to make her kin nobles. Her first step was to install her maternal grandson Zhang Yan (張偃; Princess Yuan of Lu&#x27;s son, Empress Zhang Yan&#x27;s brother) as the Prince of Lu. Over the next few years she instated several of her nephews and grandnephews as princes and marquises. In an unprecedented move, in 184 BC, Lü Zhi also granted her younger sister Lü Xu () the title of Marquise of Lingguang, in a separate fief from that of the latter&#x27;s husband Fan Kuai.

Around 184 BC, Emperor Qianshao discovered that he was not Empress Dowager Zhang Yan&#x27;s son, and his birth mother was executed by the empress dowager. He remarked that when he grew up he would make Empress Dowager Zhang pay for his mother&#x27;s death. When Lü Zhi heard about this, she had the young emperor secretly confined in the palace and publicly announced that the emperor was seriously ill and unable to meet anyone. After some time, she told the imperial court that Emperor Qianshao was still sick and suffered from psychosis, and was thus incapable of ruling. She then proposed that the emperor be replaced. The court complied with her wish, and Emperor Qianshao was deposed and put to death. He was succeeded by his brother, Liu Yi (), who was renamed to Liu Hong (), and was also historically known as Emperor Houshao of Han. Like his predecessor Emperor Qianshao, Liu Hong is generally not regarded as a real monarch, so he is also not included in the list of emperors of the Han dynasty.

== Death ==

Lü Zhi died of illness at the age of 61 in 180 BC and was interred in Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s tomb in Changling (). Near the end of Wang Mang&#x27;s Xin dynasty (AD 9 – AD 23), Lü Zhi&#x27;s body was desecrated by Chimei rebels when they raided Gaozu&#x27;s tomb. Emperor Guangwu, who restored the Han dynasty in AD 25, posthumously replaced Lü Zhi as &quot;Empress Gao&quot; in Gaozu&#x27;s temple with another of Gaozu&#x27;s concubines, Consort Bo. Lü Zhi was enshrined in a separate temple instead.

In the aftermath of Lü Zhi&#x27;s death, her clan members were overthrown from their positions of power and massacred, in an event historically known as the Lü Clan Disturbance. The masterminds of this coup d&#x27;état included ministers who previously served Emperor Gaozu, including Chen Ping, Zhou Bo, and Guan Ying. Liu Heng, a son of Gaozu and Consort Bo, was installed on the throne as Emperor Wen of Han.

<text>Non-binary and genderqueer are umbrella terms for gender identities that are outside the male/female gender binary. Non-binary identities often fall under the transgender umbrella since non-binary people typically identify with a gender that is different from the sex assigned to them at birth, although some non-binary people do not consider themselves transgender.

Non-binary people may identify as an intermediate or separate third gender, identify with more than one gender or no gender, or have a fluctuating gender identity. Gender identity is separate from sexual or romantic orientation; non-binary people have various sexual orientations.

Being non-binary is also not the same as being intersex. Most intersex people identify as either men or women, although some identify as only non-binary, some identify as non-binary and genderfluid, while others identify as non-binary men or non-binary women.

Non-binary people as a group vary in their gender expressions, and some may reject gender identity altogether. Some non-binary people receive gender-affirming care to reduce the mental distress caused by gender dysphoria, such as gender-affirming surgery or hormone replacement therapy.

== Terms and definitions ==
The term &quot;genderqueer&quot; first appeared in queer zines of the 1980s, preceding the more widely used &quot;non-binary.&quot; It gained prominence in the 1990s through activists, such as Riki Anne Wilchins, who used it in a 1995 essay and a 1997 autobiography to describe individuals deviating from traditional gender norms. By 2002, the term had further dissemination through the anthology &quot;Genderqueer: Voices Beyond the Sexual Binary&quot;. The rise of the internet and public identification by celebrities brought the term &quot;genderqueer&quot; into mainstream awareness during the 2010s.

Genderqueer serves as both an umbrella term for non-binary identities and an adjective describing those who challenge or diverge from conventional gender distinctions, regardless of how they personally identify. It encompasses a range of expressions that transcend the binary gender categories of man and woman.

Additionally, being genderqueer is associated with gender ambiguity, and androgynous (also &quot;androgyne&quot;) often used to describe a blend of socially defined masculine and feminine traits. However, not all genderqueer individuals identify as androgynous; some may identify with traditionally masculine or feminine traits or use alternative descriptors such as &quot;masculine woman&quot; or &quot;feminine man.&quot; The term &quot;enby,&quot; derived from the acronym NB for non-binary, is also commonly used.

The term &quot;transgender&quot; often includes those who are genderqueer or non-binary, reflecting a broad spectrum of gender diversity. This inclusive usage dates back to at least 1992, with significant contributions from figures such as Leslie Feinberg and Kate Bornstein, who emphasized the shared experiences of &quot;gender outlaws.&quot; Organizations such as the Human Rights Campaign and Gender Spectrum use &quot;gender-expansive&quot; to denote a broader range of gender identities and expressions than those typically associated with the binary gender system.

== Identities ==

=== Agender ===

 individuals, also known as genderless, gender-free, non-gendered, or ungendered, have no gender at all. This group represents a spectrum of identities that diverge from conventional gender norms. According to scholar Finn Enke, not all agender individuals may self-identify as transgender. While there is no universally accepted set of pronouns for agender people, singular they is commonly used, but it is not the default. Notably, &quot;Agender&quot; and &quot;Neutrois&quot; were among the custom gender options added to Facebook in February 2014 and to OkCupid since November 2014.

=== Multigender/polygender ===
These terms describe individuals who experience more than one gender identity, either simultaneously or alternately. This category includes identities such as demigender, bigender, pangender, and genderfluid. In contrast, those who experience a singular, unchanging gender are referred to as monogender or genderstatic.

==== Bigender ====

Bigender individuals possess two distinct gender identities that can manifest simultaneously or fluctuate between masculine and feminine expressions. This differs from genderfluid identities, which may not involve fixed gender states but rather a fluid range across the gender spectrum. The American Psychological Association recognizes bigender identity as part of the broader transgender category. Surveys and studies, including a 1999 San Francisco Department of Public Health survey and a 2016 Harris poll, have documented the prevalence of bigender identification, particularly within younger generations. Trigender people shift among male, female, and third gender.

==== Demigender ====
Individuals identifying as demigender feel a partial connection to one gender while also identifying with another gender or none at all (agender). Subcategories include demi-boy or demi-man, who partially identify as male, and demi-girl, who are partly female and partly non-binary. Demiflux people experience a stable non-binary identity with varying intensities of other gender identities.

==== Pangender ====
 individuals identify with multiple or all genders, sometimes experiencing all these identities simultaneously.

==== Genderfluid ====
Genderfluid individuals do not adhere to a fixed gender identity; their genders change depending on time, place and situation, combining elements from one or more genders at different times. This identity can overlap with bigender, trigender, polygender or pangender expressions. 

=== Transfeminine or transmasculine ===

Transfeminine refers to individuals assigned male at birth who predominantly identify or express themselves as feminine. Transmasculine refers to those assigned female at birth who predominantly identify or express themselves as masculine. These terms encompass both binary and non-binary identities.

=== Two-spirit ===
Originating from a 1990 Indigenous LGBTQ gathering in Winnipeg, the term two-spirit refers to individuals within Indigenous North American communities who embody qualities or fulfill roles across traditional gender distinctions.

=== Xenogender ===
Xenogender encompasses a variety of gender identities that are defined using non-traditional concepts often drawn from natural, inanimate, or abstract sources, representing a departure from the typical human gender binary. People who identify with a xenogender may not have the words to describe their gender, so instead they compare it to something else.

=== Other identities ===
This includes identities such as maverique, aporagender, , , and genderflux, each presenting unique perspectives and experiences outside conventional gender norms.

==History==


Non-binary gender, often included within the concept of third gender, has historical roots that extend well before the modern term was established. For instance, the Public Universal Friend, who emerged in 1776, was a genderless evangelist who renounced their birth name and gendered pronouns, representing an early instance of non-binary gender expression in America.

In 1781, Jens Andersson from Norway, assigned female at birth but identifying as male, faced imprisonment and a trial after marrying a woman. When questioned, Andersson stated, &quot;Hand troer at kunde henhøre til begge Deele&quot; (&#x27;He believes he belongs to both parts&#x27;), indicating a recognition of his dual gender identity.

Judith Butler&#x27;s &quot;Gender Trouble&quot;, published in 1990, challenged the fixed male/female binary and advocated for a broader understanding of gender as a spectrum, a view Butler has expanded upon since coming out as non-binary in 2019.

The term &quot;genderqueer&quot; surfaced in the mid-1990s, notably used by activist Riki Wilchins in the newsletter &quot;In Your Face&quot; in 1995, and later in their 1997 autobiography. Wilchins contributed significantly to the discourse, particularly with the 2002 anthology &quot;GenderQueer: Voices from beyond the Sexual Binary&quot;.

Jim Sinclair, an autism-rights activist and a founder of Autism Network International, publicly embraced a gender-neutral identity in 1997, declaring a physical and social neuter status in an introduction to the Intersex Society of North America.

In Japan, the expression &quot;X-gender&quot; () has been recognized since the late 1990s, describing a non-binary identity, with notable individuals such as manga artists Yūki Kamatani and Yuu Watase identifying as such.

In 2012, the Intersex &amp; Genderqueer Recognition Project began advocating for more inclusive gender options on official documents, a milestone realized when Elisa Rae Shupe became the first person in the U.S. to obtain official documents with a non-binary gender marker.

Alberta legislator Estefan Cortes-Vargas openly identified as non-binary during a 2015 legislative session, marking a significant moment in political recognition of non-binary identities.

==Pronouns and titles==


Many non-binary people use gender-neutral pronouns with the singular &quot;they&quot;, &quot;their&quot; and &quot;them&quot; being used most commonly in English. Some non-binary individuals opt for neopronouns such as , , , , and ey. Others may use traditional gender-specific pronouns such as &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot;, switch between them, or prefer to use their name without pronouns. The title Mx. is also increasingly used as a gender-neutral honorific.

A significant 2015 study by the National Center for Transgender Equality surveyed nearly 28,000 transgender people in the United States, finding that 35% identified as non-binary or genderqueer. Among them, 84% used pronouns different from those associated with the gender on their birth certificates. The breakdown of preferred pronouns was 37% for &quot;he/him&quot;, 37% for &quot;she/her&quot;, and 29% for &quot;they/them&quot;. Additionally, 20% did not request specific pronouns be used for them, and 4% used pronouns not listed in the survey.In a 2023 Gender Census survey, 40,375 participants provided insights into how they describe their gender identity and their preferred references. The key identity labels reported were nonbinary, used by 63.1% of respondents (down 0.8% from the previous year), queer (54.8%, up 0.2%), trans (46.7%, up 8.5%), a category described simply as a person/human/[my name]/&quot;I&#x27;m just me&quot; (42.5%, newly included this year), and transgender (40.3%, up 6.4%). The survey also explored title preferences, with 40.1% preferring no title at all (up 1.5%), followed by Mx (18.7%, down 1.4%), Mr (11.5%, up 2.1%), non-gendered professional/academic titles (9.4%, up 1.0%), and Ms (5.5%, up 1.1%). Pronoun usage varied, with &quot;they/them&quot; being the most popular at 74.5% (down 1.2%), &quot;he/him&quot; at 42.5% (up 2.1%), &quot;she/her&quot; at 32.7% (no change), &quot;it/its&quot; at 19.4% (up 3.2%), and a preference for avoiding pronouns or using names as pronouns at 13.2% (up 2.1%). This data offers a comprehensive view of the diverse and evolving ways individuals within the non-binary community identify and prefer to be referred to.

==Legal recognition==
Many non-binary/genderqueer people use the gender they were given at birth to conduct everyday business, as many institutions and forms of identification—such as passports and driver&#x27;s licenses—only accept, in the sense of recorded recognition, binary gender identities. But with the increasing acceptance of non-binary gender identities and the rise in wider societal recognition, this is slowly changing, as more governments and institutions recognize and allow non-binary identities.

Multiple countries legally recognize non-binary or third gender classifications. Some non-Western societies have long recognized transgender people as a third gender, although this may not (or may only recently) include formal legal recognition. In Western societies, Australia may have been the first country to legally recognize a classification of sex outside of &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot; on legal documentation, with the recognition of Alex MacFarlane&#x27;s intersex status in 2003. The wider legal recognition of non-binary people—following the recognition of intersex people in 2003—in Australian law followed between 2010 and 2014, with legal action taken against the New South Wales Government Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages by transgender activist Norrie May-Welby to recognize Norrie&#x27;s legal gender identity as &quot;non-specific&quot;. India&#x27;s Supreme Court formally recognized transgender and non-binary people as a distinct third gender in 2014, following legal action taken by transgender activist Laxmi Narayan Tripathi. In July 2021, Argentina incorporated non-binary gender in its national ID card, becoming the first country in South America to legally recognize non-binary gender on all official documentation; non-binary people in the country will have the option to renew their ID with the letter &quot;X&quot; under gender.

While the United States does not federally recognize a non-binary gender, in 2016 Oregon became the first state to recognize a non-binary gender identity. In 2017, California passed an act allowing citizens to identify as &quot;non-binary&quot; on official documents. , eight states have passed acts that allow &quot;non-binary&quot; or &quot;X&quot; designations on certain identifying documents. One of the main arguments against the inclusion of a third gender identifier in the U.S. is that it would make law enforcement and surveillance harder, but countries that have officially recognized a third gender marker have not reported these issues. In the U.S. there are no explicit laws to protect non-binary people from discrimination, but under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it is illegal for an employer to require employees to conform to gender stereotypes, or to fire them merely for being transgender.

==Discrimination==

Various countries throughout history have criminalized transgender and non-binary gender identities.

In the U.S., 13% of respondents to the 2008 National Transgender Discrimination Survey chose &quot;a gender not listed here&quot;. The &quot;not listed here&quot; respondents were 9 percentage points more probably to report forgoing healthcare due to fear of discrimination than the general sample (36% compared to 27%). 90 percent reported experiencing anti-trans bias at work, and 43 percent reported having attempted suicide.

The reported discrimination non-binary people face includes disregard, disbelief, condescending interactions, and disrespect. Non-binary people are also often viewed as partaking in a trend and thus deemed insincere or attention-seeking. As an accumulation, erasure is often a significant form of discrimination non-binary people face.

Misgendering, intentional or not, is also a problem that many face. In the case of intentional misgendering, transphobia is a driving force. Additionally, the use of they/them pronouns is lumped into the larger, controversial, subject of safe spaces and political correctness, causing pushback and intentional misgendering by some people.

Non-binary and transgender identifying people also face discrimination in sports participation. Non-binary identifying athletes have an immediate barrier as most sports competitions are divided into men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s categories.

==Healthcare==
Nonbinary people may report significantly worse health and general wellbeing than binary transgender people, although current research demonstrates conflicting perspectives on this topic. These health disparities may be exacerbated by minority stress by breaking gender and social norms.

Healthcare professionals are often uninformed about nonbinary people&#x27;s specific health needs, sometimes requiring nonbinary patients to educate them. Some providers may believe that nonbinary people do not require transition-related treatment, while others may not understand the difference between their identity and the identities of binary transgender patients. Nonbinary patients report lower rates of respect from healthcare providers than binary transgender people.

===Transgender health care===
Some nonbinary people desire gender-affirming health care, including hormone replacement therapy or surgery. Others do not, and the ratio of those who desire care to those who do not is unclear. The factors that lead to this decision are complex and unique to each person.

Nonbinary patients seeking gender-affirming care typically begin treatment earlier than binary transgender patients.

===Mental health care===
Nonbinary people are likely to face more mental stress than binary transgender people. This can be for many reasons including worse mental health and being discouraged from using the bathroom of their choice. According to the Trevor Project, 54% of non-binary and transgender youth have considered suicide and 58% have been discouraged from using the bathroom corresponding to their gender identity.

==Symbols and observances==

Many flags have been used in non-binary and genderqueer communities to represent various identities. There are distinct non-binary and genderqueer pride flags. The genderqueer pride flag was designed in 2011 by Marilyn Roxie. Lavender represents androgyny or queerness, white represents agender identity, and green represents those whose identities which are defined outside the binary. The non-binary pride flag was created in 2014 by Kye Rowan. Yellow represents people whose gender exists outside the binary, purple represents those whose gender is a mixture of—or between—male and female, black represents people who have no gender, and white represents those who embrace many or all genders.

Genderfluid people, who fall under the genderqueer umbrella, also have their own flag. Pink represents femininity, white represents lack of gender, purple represents mixed gender or androgyny, black represents all other genders, and blue represents masculinity.

Agender people, who also sometimes identify as genderqueer, have their own flag. This flag uses black and white stripes to represent an absence of gender, and a green stripe to represent non-binary genders.

International Non-Binary People&#x27;s Day is celebrated on July 14. Other observances with non-binary participation include International Transgender Day of Visibility, observed on March 31, and International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia, observed on May 17.

==Population figures==
===Argentina===
On July 20, 2021, President Alberto Fernández signed Decreto 476/2021, mandating that the National Registry of Persons (RENAPER) allow a third gender option on all national identity cards and passports, marked as &quot;X&quot;. The measure also applies to non-citizen permanent residents who possess Argentine identity cards. The 2022 national census, carried out less than a year after the resolution was implemented, counted 8,293 (roughly 0.12%) of the country&#x27;s population identifying with the &quot;X / other&quot; gender marker.

===Brazil===
A 2021 survey published in &quot;Scientific Reports&quot; concluded that 1.19% of Brazilian adults are non-binary, but the study did not ask whether they self-identified as non-binary. Because the authors considered most Brazilians unfamiliar with North American gender terminology, more open-ended questions about gender were asked.

===Canada===
In April 2022, Statistics Canada released findings from the 2021 census, making Canada the first country to ask a core question about gender identity, and found that 41,355 Canadians aged 15 and over identified as nonbinary.

A 2019 survey of the two-spirit and LGBTQ+ population in Hamilton, Ontario, called &quot;Mapping the Void: Two-Spirit and LGBTQ+ Experiences in Hamilton&quot; showed that 19% of the 906 respondents identified as non-binary.

A 2017 survey of Canadian LGBT+ people called &quot;LGBT+ Realities Survey&quot; found that 4% of the 1,897 respondents identified as non-binary transgender and 1% identified as non-binary outside of the transgender umbrella.

===Switzerland===
A 2021 survey found that 0.4% of adults in Switzerland describe themselves as non-binary. The survey of 2,690 Swiss residents was weighted to be reflective of the entire population.

===United Kingdom===
According to the 2021 United Kingdom census, 0.06% of the population in England and Wales identified as non-binary. The proportion was highest among people aged 16 to 24 years (0.26% or 17,000).

===United States===
According to a 2021 study by the Williams Institute, an estimated 1.2 million American adults aged between 18 and 60 identify as non-binary, making up 11% of the LGBTQ population in that age bracket.

A 2020 survey by The Trevor Project found that 26% of LGBTQ youth (ages 13–24) in the U.S. identify as non-binary.

According to &quot;The Report of the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey&quot;, 35% of the nearly 28,000 transgender respondents to the anonymous online survey identified as non-binary.

<text>Flying Finn Ltd (, ) was a low cost airline, based at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport, Finland. It ceased operations in 2004.

== History ==

The airline was established in December 2002 and started operations on 16 March 2003. Its cheap air fares were based on the fact that the e-tickets were only sold through Internet and phone. The airline claimed a successful beginning, as the passengers who formerly bought bus and train tickets now bought cheaper flights.

The president of the company was Peter Sevelius. The flight captains had been employed from Finnair. It had many celebrities as shareholders, such as the rally driver Juha Kankkunen. Its competitors included Finnair, Ryanair and Soder Airlines.

In January 2004, faced with the threat of the termination of its plane lease and operating license for unpaid debts, the financially ailing airline cancelled its flights to London and went into debt restructuring. On January 27, 2004, Flying Finn ceased all flights and filed for bankruptcy. Over 20,000 passengers were left without refund.

In August 2007, there was speculation by Keskusrikospoliisi (the National Bureau of Investigation) that there are financial irregularities due to the airline accounts, leading to seven former employees being accused of breaking bankruptcy laws.

== Services ==

Flying Finn operated daily flights between Helsinki and Oulu. It also ran limited services between Helsinki and Rovaniemi, Kuopio and London Stansted.

== Fleet ==

The Flying Finn fleet consisted of 2 leased McDonnell Douglas MD-83 aircraft which originated from Finnair.

<text>&quot;The Flying Finn&quot; (, ) is a nickname given to several Finnish athletes who were noted for their speed. Originally, it was given to several Finnish middle and long-distance runners. The term was later extended to notable Finnish racing drivers.

&quot;Flying Finn&quot; is also the title of a documentary about the history of sports in Finland, and is the first English-language documentary produced in Finland.

==Running==
The nickname was first used of Hannes Kolehmainen, also known as &quot;Smiling Hannes.&quot; He took home three gold medals and broke two world records during the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. As Finnish runners started to dominate long-distance running, the nickname was passed on to all successful Finns in the sport, including multi-Olympic gold medalists Paavo Nurmi and Ville Ritola. Nurmi won three gold medals at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Belgium and five at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, where he was partnered with Ritola, who ran to four gold medals. Volmari Iso-Hollo, the winner of 3000 m steeplechase at the 1932 and 1936 Summer Olympics, was one of the best-known Finnish runners in the 1930s and also nicknamed the Flying Finn. During his tour of the United States in 1940, Taisto Mäki—who held five world records—was regularly referred to as a Flying Finn. The last Flying Finn in running was Lasse Virén, who won the 5000 m and 10,000 m events at the 1972 and 1976 Summer Olympics.

==Motorsport==
===Rallying===

The nickname was next used to describe the efforts of Finnish rally drivers in the 1960s. Timo Mäkinen, Rauno Aaltonen and Simo Lampinen were among the first drivers referenced as the Flying Finn. In 1968, Castrol released a film called &quot;The Flying Finns&quot;, it featured the 1968 1000 Lakes Rally and concentrated on documenting the duel between Mäkinen and Hannu Mikkola. The term then moved on to the next generations of Finnish rally drivers, and among others, the four-time World Rally Champions Juha Kankkunen and Tommi Mäkinen were often referred to as Flying Finns.

The first driver to carry the nickname in Formula One was Leo Kinnunen. Kinnunen had the title written on his helmet in 1970, when he won the World Sportscar Championship for Porsche. However, he could not turn his success in sports car racing into a successful F1 career in his underpowered Surtees. In the 1980s the moniker was given to Keke Rosberg, who became the first well-known Finn in the sport, winning the 1982 world championship. Following the success of later Finnish drivers, Rosberg has been described as the &quot;original Flying Finn&quot;.

After Rosberg, many Finnish Formula 1 drivers have also been called the &quot;Flying Finn&quot;, including Mika Häkkinen, who won the drivers&#x27; championship in 1998 and 1999; Mika Salo; Kimi Räikkönen, who was drivers&#x27; champion in 2007; Heikki Kovalainen; and Valtteri Bottas.

===Motorcycles===
On two wheels, the most famous Flying Finn was Jarno Saarinen, also known as &quot;The Baron&quot;, who won the 250cc road racing World Championship as privateer in 1972, and finished a close second to Giacomo Agostini in the 350cc class. Saarinen died the following year, while leading both the 250cc and 500cc championships and after competing for only three years. He remains in motorcycle sport history books for developing a new riding style, which is still predominantly in use today; body hanging off the bike with knee near the ground. During the 1970s, Finnish rider Heikki Mikkola won four motocross world championships and also became known as the &quot;Flying Finn&quot;. Mika Kallio, who finished second in the 125cc championship in 2005 and 2006, has also been nicknamed the Flying Finn. Mauno Hermunen, who has finished third in 2010 and fourth in 2011 in the world supermoto series, has also been nicknamed the Flying Finn.

==Football==
Shefki Kuqi, who played for Scottish side Hibernian F.C. was nicknamed the &quot;Flying Finn&quot;, owing to a strange but popular goal celebration, throwing himself onto the ground, with his arms outstretched and landing on his chest.

<text>Richard Arnold &quot;Groove&quot; Holmes (May 2, 1931 – June 29, 1991) was an American jazz organist who performed in the hard bop and soul jazz genre. He is best known for his 1965 recording of &quot;Misty&quot;.

==Career==
Holmes&#x27;s first album, on Pacific Jazz with guest Ben Webster, was recorded in March 1961. He recorded many albums for Pacific Jazz, Prestige, Groove Merchant, and Muse, many of them with Houston Person.

<doc id="265000" wikidata="Q612991" url="?curid=265000" title="Hilbert matrix">
<text>In linear algebra, a Hilbert matrix, introduced by , is a square matrix with entries being the unit fractions

: formula_1

For example, this is the 5 × 5 Hilbert matrix:

: formula_2

The entries can also be defined by the integral

: formula_3

that is, as a Gramian matrix for powers of &quot;x&quot;. It arises in the least squares approximation of arbitrary functions by polynomials.

The Hilbert matrices are canonical examples of ill-conditioned matrices, being notoriously difficult to use in numerical computation. For example, the 2-norm condition number of the matrix above is about 4.8.

==Historical note==

 introduced the Hilbert matrix to study the following question in approximation theory: &quot;Assume that , is a real interval. Is it then possible to find a non-zero polynomial &quot;P&quot; with integer coefficients, such that the integral

:formula_4

is smaller than any given bound &quot;ε&quot; &gt; 0, taken arbitrarily small?&quot; To answer this question, Hilbert derives an exact formula for the determinant of the Hilbert matrices and investigates their asymptotics. He concludes that the answer to his question is positive if the length of the interval is smaller than 4.

==Properties==

The Hilbert matrix is symmetric and positive definite. The Hilbert matrix is also totally positive (meaning that the determinant of every submatrix is positive).

The Hilbert matrix is an example of a Hankel matrix. It is also a specific example of a Cauchy matrix.

The determinant can be expressed in closed form, as a special case of the Cauchy determinant. The determinant of the &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; Hilbert matrix is

: formula_5

where

: formula_6

Hilbert already mentioned the curious fact that the determinant of the Hilbert matrix is the reciprocal of an integer (see sequence in the OEIS), which also follows from the identity
: formula_7

Using Stirling&#x27;s approximation of the factorial, one can establish the following asymptotic result:

: formula_8

where &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; converges to the constant formula_9 as formula_10, where &quot;A&quot; is the Glaisher–Kinkelin constant.

The inverse of the Hilbert matrix can be expressed in closed form using binomial coefficients; its entries are

: formula_11

where &quot;n&quot; is the order of the matrix. It follows that the entries of the inverse matrix are all integers, and that the signs form a checkerboard pattern, being positive on the principal diagonal. For example,

: formula_12

The condition number of the &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; Hilbert matrix grows as formula_13.

==Applications==
The method of moments applied to polynomial distributions results in a Hankel matrix, which in the special case of approximating a probability distribution on the interval [0, 1] results in a Hilbert matrix. This matrix needs to be inverted to obtain the weight parameters of the polynomial distribution approximation.

<doc id="265002" wikidata="Q2756703" url="?curid=265002" title="Septo-optic dysplasia">
<text>Septo-optic dysplasia (SOD), known also as de Morsier syndrome, is a rare congenital malformation syndrome that features a combination of the underdevelopment of the optic nerve, pituitary gland dysfunction, and absence of the septum pellucidum (a midline part of the brain).
Two or more of these features need to be present for a clinical diagnosis—only 30% of patients have all three. French-Swiss doctor Georges de Morsier first recognized the relation of a rudimentary or absent septum pellucidum with hypoplasia of the optic nerves and chiasm in 1956.

==Signs and symptoms==

The symptoms of SOD can be divided into those related to optic nerve underdevelopment, pituitary hormone abnormalities, and mid-line brain abnormalities. Symptoms may vary greatly in their severity.

===Optic nerve underdevelopment===

About one quarter of people with SOD have significant visual impairment in one or both eyes, as a result of optic nerve underdevelopment. Developmental delays are more common in children with bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia than those with unilateral optic nerve hypoplasia. Bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia is also associated with a more severe disease course.

There may be nystagmus (involuntary eye movements, often side-to-side). In cases of bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia this can usually be detected within the first three months of life. It may be followed by strabismus developing in the first year.

===Pituitary hormone abnormalities===

Underdevelopment of the pituitary gland in SOD leads to hypopituitarism, most commonly in the form of growth hormone deficiency. In severe cases panhypopituitarism may occur.

===Mid-line brain abnormalities===

In SOD, mid-line brain structures such as the corpus callosum and the septum pellucidum may fail to develop normally, leading to neurological problems such as seizures or developmental delay. Patients with seizures are more likely to show additional neurological abnormalities such as cortical dysplasia, polymicrogyria and schizencephaly. Such abnormalities are always identified when spastic quadriplegia is present.

Neurological symptoms are typically considered late onset manifestations of SOD. Common initial presentations include epilepsy, development delays and limb weakness. Intellectual abilities vary widely from normal to severe intellectual disability. Early studies indicated intellectual disability occurs in 71% of cases, cerebral palsy occurs in 57%, and behavioral problems occur in 20%, but further research has indicated that these symptoms may be less common and caused by additional neurological abnormalities.

==Causes==

SOD results from an abnormality in the development of the embryonic forebrain at 4–6 weeks of pregnancy. There is no known single cause of SOD, but it is thought that both genetic and environmental factors may be involved.

===Genetic===

Rare familial recurrence has been reported, suggesting at least one genetic form (HESX1). Five homozygous and eight heterozygous pathogenic HESX1 mutations have been discovered. Patients with homozygous mutations present with a typical SOD phenotype while those with heterozygous mutations are mildly affected. In addition to HESX1, mutations in OTX2, SOX2 and PAX6 have been implicated in SOD. SOX2 mutations in SOD patients are associated with severe bilateral ocular anomalies such as microphthalmia and anophthalmia. Additional features associated with SOX2 mutations include developmental delay, oesophageal atresia, short stature and sensorineural hearing loss. Genetic abnormalities are identified in fewer than one percent of patients.

==Diagnosis==

A diagnosis of SOD is made when at least two of the following triad are present: optic nerve underdevelopment; pituitary hormone abnormalities; and mid-line brain abnormalities. Diagnosis is usually made at birth or during childhood, and a clinical diagnosis can be confirmed by MRI scans.

==Treatment==

There is no cure for SOD. Treatment aims to manage symptoms and may require a multidisciplinary team of specialists including neurologists, ophthalmologists and endocrinologists. Hormone deficiencies may be treated with HRT but vision impairments are not usually treatable.

==Epidemiology==

A European survey put the prevalence of SOD at somewhere in the region of 1.9 to 2.5 per 100,000 live births, with the United Kingdom having a particularly high rate and with increased risk for younger mothers.

==History==

In 1941 David Reeves at the Children&#x27;s Hospital Los Angeles described an association between underdevelopment of the optic nerve with an absent septum pellucidum. Fifteen years later French doctor Georges de Morsier reported his theory that the two abnormalities were connected and coined the term septo-optic dysplasia. In 1970 American doctor William Hoyt made the connection between the three features of SOD and named the syndrome after de Morsier.

==In popular culture==
British model and television personality Katie Price&#x27;s son, Harvey, has this condition.

<text>John Cunningham Lilly (January 6, 1915 – September 30, 2001) was an American physician, neuroscientist, psychoanalyst, psychonaut, philosopher, writer, and inventor. He was a member of a group of counterculture thinkers that included Timothy Leary, Ram Dass, and Werner Erhard, all frequent visitors to the Lilly home. He often stirred controversy, especially among mainstream scientists.

Lilly conducted high-altitude research during World War II and later trained as a psychoanalyst. He gained renown in the 1950s after developing the isolation tank. He saw the tanks, in which users are isolated from almost all external stimuli, as a means to explore the nature of human consciousness. He later combined that work with his efforts to communicate with dolphins. He began studying how bottlenose dolphins vocalize, establishing centers in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and later San Francisco, to study dolphins. A decade later, he began experimenting with psychedelics, including LSD, often while floating in isolation. His work inspired two Hollywood movies, &quot;The Day of the Dolphin&quot; (1973) and &quot;Altered States&quot; (1980), as well as the videogame series &quot;Ecco the Dolphin&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Lilly was born to a wealthy family on January 6, 1915, in Saint Paul, Minnesota. His father was Richard Coyle Lilly, president of the First National Bank of St. Paul. His mother was Rachel Lenor Cunningham, whose family owned the Cunningham &amp; Haas Company, a large stockyards company in St. Paul. Lilly had an older brother, Richard Lilly Jr., and a younger brother, David Maher Lilly. A fourth child, Mary Catherine Lilly, died in infancy.

Lilly showed an interest in science at an early age. At thirteen years old, he was an avid chemistry hobbyist, supplementing his makeshift basement laboratory with chemicals given to him by a pharmacist friend. Students at his parochial Catholic grade school called him &quot;Einstein Jr.&quot; At age 14 he enrolled at St. Paul Academy (SPA), a college preparatory academy for boys, where his teachers encouraged him to pursue science further and conduct his experiments in the school laboratory after hours.

While at SPA, Lilly also further developed his interest in philosophy. He studied the works of many of the great philosophers, finding himself especially attracted to the subjective idealism of Irish theologian and philosopher George Berkeley.

Despite his father&#x27;s wish that he go to an eastern Ivy League university to become a banker, Lilly received a scholarship at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, where he studied biology. He was the president of the ski club and a member of the drama club, and lived in Blacker House. After his first year, Caltech learned that Lilly was from a wealthy family and cancelled his scholarship, forcing him to go to his father for help. Dick Lilly set up a trust fund to pay the tuition and eventually became a benefactor of the college. Lilly continued to draw on his family wealth to fund his scientific pursuits throughout his life.

In 1934, Lilly read Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World.&quot; The pharmacological control methods of Huxley&#x27;s dystopia and the links between physical chemical processes of the brain and subjective experiences of the mind helped inspire Lilly to give up his study of physics and pursue biology, eventually focusing on neurophysiology.

Lilly was engaged to Mary Crouch at the beginning of his junior year at Caltech. Months before their wedding, he took a job with a lumber company in the Northwest to soothe a bout of &quot;nervous exhaustion&quot; brought on by the pressures of academia and his upcoming marriage. During this sabbatical he was hospitalized after injuring his foot with an ax while cutting brush. His time in the trauma ward inspired him to become a doctor of medicine.

In 1937, while Lilly was looking for a good medical school, his wealthy and well-connected father arranged a meeting between Lilly and Charles Horace Mayo of the famous Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Following Mayo&#x27;s advice, Lilly applied and was accepted to Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, where he became good friends with Mayo&#x27;s son, Charles William Mayo. Lilly graduated from Caltech with a Bachelor of Science degree on June 10, 1938, and enrolled at Dartmouth the following September.

At Dartmouth, Lilly launched into the study of anatomy, performing dissections on 32 cadavers during his time there. He once stretched out an entire intestinal tract across the length of a room to determine its actual length with certainty.

During the summer after his first year at Dartmouth, Lilly returned to Pasadena to participate in an experiment with his former Caltech biochemistry professor Henry Borsook. The purpose of the experiment was to study the creation of glycocyamine, a major source of muscle power in the human body. The experiment involved putting Lilly on a completely protein-free diet while administering measured doses of glycine and arginine, the two amino acids that Borsook hypothesized were involved in the creation of glycocyamine. The experiments pushed Lilly to extreme physical and mental limits; he became increasingly weak and delirious as the weeks went on. The results of the experiment confirmed Borsook&#x27;s hypothesis and Lilly&#x27;s name was included among the authors, making it the first published research paper of his career. It was also one of the first instances of a lifelong pattern of experimenting on his own body to the point of endangering his health.

After two years at Dartmouth, Lilly decided that he wanted to pursue a career in medical research, rather than therapeutic practice as was standard for Dartmouth medical students at that time. He decided to transfer to the medical school at the University of Pennsylvania, which would provide him with better opportunities for conducting research.

At the University of Pennsylvania, Lilly met Professor H. Cuthbert Bazett, a protege of British physiologist J. B. S. Haldane. Bazett introduced Lilly to Haldane&#x27;s view that scientists should never conduct an experiment or procedure on another person that they have not first conducted on themselves, a view Lilly embraced and attempted to exemplify throughout his career. Bazett took a liking to the young, enthusiastic graduate student, and set Lilly up with his own research laboratory. While working under Bazett, Lilly created his first invention, the electrical capacitance diaphragm manometer, a device for measuring blood pressure. While designing the instrument, he received electrical engineering advice from biophysics pioneer Britton Chance. Chance also introduced Lilly to the world of computers, which was still in its infancy.

While finishing his degree at the University of Pennsylvania, Lilly enrolled in a class entitled &quot;How to Build an Atomic Bomb.&quot; He and several other students transcribed their notes from the class into a book with the same title. The director of the Manhattan Project, General Leslie Groves, attempted to suppress publication of the book, but was unable to because no classified data were used in writing the book.

Lilly graduated with a medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1942.

==Career overview==
Lilly was a physician and psychoanalyst. He made contributions in the fields of biophysics, neurophysiology, electronics, computer science, and neuroanatomy. He invented and promoted the use of an isolation tank as a means of sensory deprivation. He also attempted communication between humans and dolphins.

Lilly&#x27;s career as a scientist began doing research for universities and government. He gradually began researching less conventional topics. He published 19 books, including &quot;The Center of the Cyclone&quot;, which describes his own LSD experiences, and &quot;Man and Dolphin&quot; and &quot;The Mind of the Dolphin&quot;, which describe his work with dolphins.

In the mid-1950s, Lilly began dolphin cognition and communication research, with an intensive period of work through the late 1960s. This period brought many discoveries about dolphin anatomy and brain structure, as well as behavioral and communication observations. Originally researching at Coconut Grove, Florida, Lilly purchased a property in St. Thomas in 1960. The seaside lab was converted into a dolphin–human cohabitation house by purposely flooding part of the building.

In the 1980s Lilly directed a project that attempted to teach dolphins a computer-synthesised language. He designed a future &quot;communications laboratory&quot; that would be a floating living room where humans and dolphins could chat as equals and develop a common language. In the 1990s Lilly moved to Maui, Hawaii, where he lived most of the remainder of his life.

=== Research ===
During World War II, Lilly researched the physiology of high-altitude flying and invented instruments for measuring gas pressure. After the war, he trained in psychoanalysis at the University of Pennsylvania, where he began researching the physical structures of the brain and consciousness. In 1951 he published a paper showing how he could display patterns of brain electrical activity on a cathode ray display screen using electrodes he devised specially for insertion into a living brain. Furthermore, Lilly&#x27;s work on electrical stimulation of the nervous system gave rise to biphasic charge balanced electrical stimulation pulses (later known as &quot;Lilly&#x27;s wave&quot; or &quot;Lilly&#x27;s pulses&quot;), now an established approach to design of safe electrical stimulation in neuroprosthetics. In the 1960s he sponsored research on human–animal communication with a dolphin.

=== Development of the isolation tank ===

In 1953, Lilly began a job studying neurophysiology with the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Officers Corps. At the N.I.M.H. in 1954, with the aim of isolating a brain from external stimulation, he devised the first isolation tank, a dark soundproof tank of warm salt water in which subjects could float for long periods in sensory isolation. Lilly and a research colleague were the first subjects of this research. What had been known as perceptual isolation or sensory deprivation was reconceptualized as Restricted Environmental Stimulation Technique (R.E.S.T.).

Lilly later studied other large-brained mammals and during the late 1950s he established a facility devoted to fostering human–dolphin communication: the Communication Research Institute on St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands. During the early 1960s, Lilly and coworkers published several papers reporting that dolphins could mimic human speech patterns.

=== S.E.T.I. ===
Lilly was interested in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project. In 1961 a group of scientists including Lilly gathered at the Green Bank Observatory to discuss the possibility of using the techniques of radio astronomy to detect evidence of intelligent life outside the solar system. They called themselves &quot;The Order of the Dolphin&quot; after Lilly&#x27;s work with dolphins. They discussed the Drake equation, used to estimate the number of communicative civilizations in our galaxy.

=== Exploration of human consciousness ===
In the early 1960s, Lilly was introduced to psychedelic drugs such as LSD and began a series of experiments in which he ingested a psychedelic drug either in an isolation tank or in the company of dolphins. These events are described in his books &quot;Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer&quot;, published in 1968, and &quot;The Center of the Cyclone&quot;, published in 1972. Following advice from Ram Dass, Lilly studied Patanjali&#x27;s system of yoga (finding I. K. Taimni&#x27;s &quot;Science of Yoga&quot;, a modernized interpretation of the Sanskrit text, most suited to his goals). He also paid special attention to self-enquiry meditation advocated by Ramana Maharshi, and reformulated the principles of this exercise with reference to his human biocomputer paradigm (described in and ).

Lilly later traveled to Chile and trained with the spiritual leader Oscar Ichazo, whose attitude to metaphysical consciousness exploration Lilly characterized as &quot;empirical&quot;. Lilly wrote that he had achieved the maximum degree of satori-samādhi consciousness during his training.

Lilly&#x27;s maxim: &quot;In the province of the mind what one believes to be true, either is true or becomes true within certain limits. These limits are to be found experimentally and experientially. When so found these limits turn out to be further beliefs to be transcended. In the province of the mind there are no limits. However, in the province of the body there are definite limits not to be transcended.&quot;

===&quot;Solid State Intelligence&quot;===
Solid State Intelligence (S.S.I.) is a malevolent entity described by Lilly in his 1978 autobiography, &quot;The Scientist&quot;. According to Lilly, the network of computation-capable solid state systems (electronics) engineered by humans will eventually develop into an autonomous &quot;bioform.&quot; Since the optimal survival conditions for this bioform (low-temperature vacuum) are drastically different from those humans need (room temperature aerial atmosphere and adequate water supply), Lilly predicted a dramatic conflict between the two forms of intelligence.

===Earth Coincidence Control Office (E.C.C.O.)===
In 1974, Lilly&#x27;s research using various psychoactive drugs led him to believe in the existence of a certain hierarchical group of cosmic entities, the lowest of which he later dubbed Earth Coincidence Control Office (E.C.C.O.) in an autobiography published jointly with his wife Antonietta (often called Toni). Lilly states that &quot;[t]here exists a Cosmic Coincidence Control Center (CCCC) with a Galactic substation called Galactic Coincidence Control (GCC). Within GCC is the Solar System Control Unit (SSCU), within which is the Earth Coincidence Control Office (ECCO).&quot;

Lilly also wrote that there are nine conditions that should be followed by people who seek to experience coincidence in their own lives:

# You must know/assume/simulate our existence in E.C.C.O.
# You must be willing to accept our responsibility for control of your coincidences.
# You must exert your best capabilities for your survival programs and your own development as an advancing/advanced member of E.C.C.O.&#x27;s earthside corps of controlled coincidence workers. You are expected to use your best intelligence in this service.
# You are expected to expect the unexpected every minute, every hour of every day and of every night.
# You must be able to maintain conscious/thinking/reasoning no matter what events we arrange to happen to you. Some of these events will seem cataclysmic/catastrophic/overwhelming: remember to stay aware, no matter what happens/apparently happens to you.
# You are in our training program for life: there is no escape from it. We (not you) control the long-term coincidences; you (not we) control the shorter-term coincidences by your own efforts.
# Your major mission on earth is to discover/create that which we do to control the long-term coincidence patterns: you are being trained on Earth to do this job.
# When your mission on planet Earth is completed, you will no longer be required to remain/return there.
# Remember the motto passed to us (from G.C.C. via S.S.C.U.): &quot;Cosmic Love is absolutely Ruthless and Highly Indifferent: it teaches its lessons whether you like/dislike them or not.&quot;

==Personal life==
Lilly married Mary Crouch in 1936. In 1937, they had their first son, John Jr. Lilly. In 1943, they had their second son, Charles Lilly. In 1958, Lilly moved to the Virgin Islands.

In 1959, Lilly and Mary divorced but would remain friendly thereafter. During the same year (1959) Lilly married Elisabeth Bjerg whom he met on the islands. She was a divorced former fashion model and already had three children of her own. In 1960 the couple had Lilly&#x27;s only biological daughter, Cynthia Olivia Roslyn. In May 1968, Lilly and Elisabeth separated, and they later divorced. Elisabeth left and took their children with her.

While still living in Los Angeles, Lilly met Antonietta (Toni) Lena in February 1971. Lena already had a daughter, Nina Carozza. Lilly and Lena formed a romantic as well as a spiritual relationship which later inspired the writing of their book &quot;The Dyadic Cyclone&quot; (1974). Lilly later described Lena as his &quot;best friend, love, and wife.&quot; During the same year (1971) Lilly and his new family moved to Malibu, California, where they organized workshops with Lena. Lena died in 1986. Their daughter Nina Carozza Lilly continued living at Lilly&#x27;s house in Malibu even after Lilly had moved out in 1992.

During the subsequent years, Lilly adopted two more daughters, including Lisa Lyon.

Lilly continued living in Malibu until 1992. In 1992 he moved to the Hawaiian island of Maui where he continued his research with dolphins and whales in the wild. From there he also continued travelling to and lecturing in Japan, Europe and the United States.

==Death==
Lilly died of heart failure at age 86 in Los Angeles on September 30, 2001. His remains were cremated.

==Legacy==
His literary rights and scientific discoveries were owned by Human Software, Inc., while his philanthropic endeavors were owned by the Human Dolphin Foundation. The John C. Lilly Research Institute, Inc. continues to research topics of interest to Lilly and carry on his legacy.

==In popular culture==
Lilly&#x27;s work with dolphins and the development of the sensory deprivation tank have been referenced in movies, music and television productions. &quot;Dolphin Island: A Story of the People of the Sea&quot; is a 1963 novel by Arthur C. Clarke set in a strange and fascinating research community where a brilliant professor tries to communicate with dolphins. In the 1972 novel &quot;The Listeners&quot;, Lilly and the other scientists who were members of the &quot;Order of the Dolphin&quot; are mentioned as pioneers.

The 1967 French science fiction thriller &quot;Un animal doué de raison&quot; by Robert Merle (translated into English as &quot;The Day of the Dolphin&quot; in 1969) features a central character who is a government scientist with similar ideas to those of Lilly.

In the 1973 film based on the book, George C. Scott portrays a Lilly-esque scientist, known to the dolphins as &quot;Pa,&quot; who succeeds in teaching a dolphin to speak elementary English.

The 1980 movie &quot;Altered States&quot;, based on Paddy Chayefsky&#x27;s novel of the same name, features actor William Hurt regressing to a simian form by ingesting psychoactive substances and then experiencing the effects of prolonged occupation of a sensory deprivation chamber.

In 1985, Dale Peterson and early art game designer John O&#x27;Neill consulted Lilly for assistance in developing their Commodore 64 game &quot;The Dolphin&#x27;s Pearl&quot; (later retitled as &quot;The Dolphin&#x27;s Rune&quot;).

The video game &quot;Ecco the Dolphin&quot; (1992) also contains references to Lilly, including being named in reference to the Earth Coincidence Control Office.

American avant-garde musician Laurie Anderson released a spoken-word song about Lilly titled &quot;John Lilly&quot; on her 1995 album, &quot;The Ugly One with the Jewels&quot;.

In 2001, supergroup Oysterhead, created a song &quot;Oz is Ever Floating&quot; referencing the tanks of John C. Lilly.

On June 15, 2014, comedians Dave Anthony and Gareth Reynolds published an episode of their podcast &quot;The Dollop&quot; about Lilly, where they detail his life, research, and drug use.

In 2019, Lilly&#x27;s research was featured in the sixth season of &quot;Drunk History&quot; in the episode entitled &quot;Drugs&quot;.

==Inventions==
Besides the isolation tank, Lilly invented:

*Micrometric measurement of the melting point of drugs (Micro-melting Point Device for Drugs, 1940)
*Electric manometer (Electrical Capacitance Diaphragm Manometer, 1942)
*Nitrogen meter (Nitrogen Meter, 1943)
*Apparatus for measuring pressure variations (Variable Pressure and Mechanical Capacitor, 1947)
*Apparatus for measuring respiratory flow (Respiratory Flow Meter, 1950)
*Multi-Channel Electrical Imaging Apparatus (25 Channel Bavatron and Electro-Iconograms, 1950)

<text>Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (&quot;Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo&quot;) is a 1632 book by Galileo Galilei comparing Nicolaus Copernicus&#x27;s heliocentric system model with Ptolemy&#x27;s geocentric model. Written in Italian, it was translated into Latin as &quot;Systema cosmicum&quot; (&quot;Cosmic System&quot;) in 1635 by Matthias Bernegger. The book was dedicated to Galileo&#x27;s patron, Ferdinando II de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who received the first printed copy on February 22, 1632. It consists of four Socratic dialogues between the Copernican Salviati, the educated layman Sagredo and the geocentrist Simplicio. They discuss the findings of their &quot;mutual friend the Academician&quot; (Galileo).

In the heliocentric system, the Earth and other planets orbit the Sun, while in the Ptolemaic system, everything in the Universe circles around the Earth. The &quot;Dialogue&quot; was published in Florence under a formal license from the Inquisition. In 1633, Galileo was found to be &quot;vehemently suspect of heresy&quot; based on the book, which was then placed on the &quot;Index of Forbidden Books&quot;, from which it was not removed until 1835 (after the theories it discussed had been permitted in print in 1822). In an action that was not announced at the time, the publication of anything else he had written or ever might write was also banned in Catholic countries.

==Overview==
While writing the book, Galileo referred to it as his &quot;Dialogue on the Tides&quot;, and when the manuscript went to the Inquisition for approval, the title was &quot;Dialogue on the Ebb and Flow of the Sea&quot;. He was ordered to remove all mention of tides from the title and to change the preface because granting approval to such a title would look like approval of his theory of the tides using the motion of the Earth as proof. As a result, the formal title on the title page is &quot;Dialogue&quot;, which is followed by Galileo&#x27;s name, academic posts, and followed by a long subtitle. The name by which the work is now known was extracted by the printer from the description on the title page when permission was given to reprint it with an approved preface by a Catholic theologian in 1744. This must be kept in mind when discussing Galileo&#x27;s motives for writing the book. Although the book is presented formally as a consideration of both systems (as it needed to be in order to be published at all), there is no question that the Copernican side gets the better of the argument.

===Structure===
The book is presented as a series of discussions, over a span of four days, among two philosophers and a layman:

* Salviati argues for the Copernican position and presents some of Galileo&#x27;s views directly, calling him the &quot;Academician&quot; in honor of Galileo&#x27;s membership in the Accademia dei Lincei. He is named after Galileo&#x27;s friend Filippo Salviati (1582–1614).
* Sagredo is an intelligent layman who is initially neutral. He is named after Galileo&#x27;s friend Giovanni Francesco Sagredo (1571–1620).
* Simplicio, a dedicated follower of Ptolemy and Aristotle, presents the traditional views and the arguments against the Copernican position. He is supposedly named after Simplicius of Cilicia, a sixth-century commentator on Aristotle, but it was suspected the name was a double entendre, as the Italian for &quot;simple&quot; (as in &quot;simple minded&quot;) is &quot;semplice&quot;. Simplicio is modeled on two contemporary conservative philosophers, Lodovico delle Colombe (1565–1616?), Galileo&#x27;s opponent, and Cesare Cremonini (1550–1631), a Paduan colleague who had refused to look through the telescope. Colombe was the leader of a group of Florentine opponents of Galileo&#x27;s, which some of the latter&#x27;s friends referred to as &quot;the pigeon league&quot;.

===Content===
The discussion is not narrowly limited to astronomical topics, but ranges over much of contemporary science. Some of this is to show what Galileo considered good science, such as the discussion of William Gilbert&#x27;s work on magnetism. Other parts are important to the debate, answering erroneous arguments against the Earth&#x27;s motion.

A classic argument against Earth motion is the lack of speed sensations of the Earth surface, though it moves, by the Earth&#x27;s rotation, at about 1700 km/h at the equator. In this category there is a thought experiment in which a man is below decks on a ship and cannot tell whether the ship is docked or is moving smoothly through the water: he observes water dripping from a bottle, fish swimming in a tank, butterflies flying, and so on; and their behavior is the same whether the ship is moving or not. This is a classic exposition of the inertial frame of reference and refutes the objection that if we were moving hundreds of kilometres an hour as the Earth rotated, anything that one dropped would rapidly fall behind and drift to the west.

The bulk of Galileo&#x27;s arguments may be divided into three classes:

* Rebuttals to the objections raised by traditional philosophers; for example, the thought experiment on the ship.
* Observations that are incompatible with the Ptolemaic model: the phases of Venus, for instance, which simply could not happen, or the apparent motions of sunspots, which could only be explained in the Ptolemaic or Tychonic systems as resulting from an implausibly complicated precession of the Sun&#x27;s axis of rotation.
* Arguments showing that the elegant unified theory of the Heavens that the philosophers held, which was believed to prove that the Earth was stationary, was incorrect; for instance, the mountains of the Moon, the moons of Jupiter, and the very existence of sunspots, none of which was part of the old astronomy.

Generally, these arguments have held up well in terms of the knowledge of the next four centuries. Just how convincing they ought to have been to an impartial reader in 1632 remains a contentious issue. Galileo attempted a fourth class of argument:

* Direct physical argument for the Earth&#x27;s motion, by means of an explanation of tides.

As an account of the causation of tides or a proof of the Earth&#x27;s motion, it is a failure. The fundamental argument is internally inconsistent and actually leads to the conclusion that tides do not exist. But, Galileo was fond of the argument and devoted the &quot;Fourth Day&quot; of the discussion to it. The degree of its failure is—like nearly anything having to do with Galileo—a matter of controversy. On the one hand, the whole thing has recently been described in print as &quot;cockamamie.&quot; On the other hand, Einstein used a rather different description:

It was Galileo&#x27;s longing for a mechanical proof of the motion of the earth which misled him into formulating a wrong theory of the tides. The &quot;fascinating arguments in the last conversation&quot; would hardly have been accepted as proof by Galileo, had his temperament not got the better of him. [Emphasis added]
===Omissions===
The &quot;Dialogue&quot; does not treat the Tychonic system, which was becoming the preferred system of many astronomers at the time of publication and which was ultimately proven incorrect. The Tychonic system is a motionless Earth system but not a Ptolemaic system; it is a hybrid system of the Copernican and Ptolemaic models. Mercury and Venus orbit the Sun (as in the Copernican system) in small circles, while the Sun in turn orbits a stationary Earth; Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn orbit the Sun in much larger circles, which means they also orbit the Earth. The Tychonian system is mathematically equivalent to the Copernican system, except that the Copernican system predicts a stellar parallax, while the Tychonian system predicts none. Stellar parallax was not measurable until the 19th century, and therefore there was at the time no valid disproof of the Tychonic system on empirical grounds, nor any decisive observational evidence for the Copernican system.

Galileo never took Tycho&#x27;s system seriously, as can be seen in his correspondence, regarding it as an inadequate and physically unsatisfactory compromise. A reason for the absence of Tycho&#x27;s system (in spite of many references to Tycho and his work in the book) may be sought in Galileo&#x27;s theory of the tides, which provided the original title and organizing principle of the &quot;Dialogue&quot;. While the Copernican and Tychonic systems are equivalent geometrically, they are quite different dynamically. Galileo&#x27;s tidal theory entailed the actual, physical movement of the Earth; that is, if true, it would have provided the kind of proof that Foucault&#x27;s pendulum apparently provided two centuries later. Without reference to Galileo&#x27;s tidal theory, there would be no difference between the Copernican and Tychonic systems.

Galileo fails to discuss the possibility of non-circular orbits, although Johannes Kepler had sent him a copy of his 1609 book, &quot;Astronomia nova&quot;, in which he proposes elliptical orbits—correctly calculating that of Mars. Prince Federico Cesi&#x27;s letter to Galileo of 1612 treated the two laws of planetary motion presented in the book as common knowledge; Kepler&#x27;s third law was published in 1619. Four and a half decades after Galileo&#x27;s death, Isaac Newton published his laws of motion and gravity, from which a heliocentric system with planets in approximately elliptical orbits is deducible.

==Summary==
&quot;Preface: To the Discerning Reader&quot; refers to the ban on the &quot;Pythagorean opinion that the earth moves&quot; and says that the author &quot;takes the Copernican side with a pure mathematical hypothesis&quot;. He introduces the friends Sagredo and Salviati with whom he had had discussions as well as the peripatetic philosopher Simplicio.

===Day one=== 
Salviati starts with Aristotle&#x27;s proof of the completeness and perfection of the world (i.e. the universe) because of its three dimensions. Simplicio points out that three was favoured by the Pythagoreans whereas Salviati cannot understand why three legs are better than two or four. He suggests that the numbers were &quot;trifles which later spread among the vulgar&quot; and that their definitions, such as those of straight lines and right angles, were more useful in establishing the dimensions. Simplicio&#x27;s response was that Aristotle thought that in physical matters mathematical demonstration was not always needed.

Salviati attacks Aristotle&#x27;s definition of the heavens as incorruptible and unchanging whilst only the lunar-bound zone shows change. He points to the changes seen in the skies: the new stars of 1572 and 1604 and sunspots, seen through the new telescope. There is a discussion about Aristotle&#x27;s use of &quot;a priori&quot; arguments. Salviati suggests that Aristotle uses Aristotle’s personal experience to choose an appropriate argument to prove just as others do and that Aristotle would change his mind in the present circumstances.

Simplicio argues that sunspots could simply be small opaque objects passing in front of the Sun, but Salviati points out that some appear or disappear randomly and those at the edge are flattened, unlike separate bodies. Therefore, &quot;it is better Aristotelian philosophy to say &#x27;Heaven is alterable because my senses tell me&#x27; than &#x27;Heaven is unalterable because Aristotle was so persuaded by reasoning.&#x27;&quot; He adds &quot;we possess a much better basis for reasoning about celestial things than Aristotle did...Now we, thanks to the telescope, have brought the heavens thirty or forty times closer to us than they were to Aristotle, so that we can discern many things in them that he could not see; among other things these sunspots, which were absolutely invisible to him.&quot; Experiments with a mirror are used to show that the Moon&#x27;s surface must be opaque and not a perfect crystal sphere as Simplicio believes. He refuses to accept that mountains on the Moon cause shadows, or that reflected light from the Earth is responsible for the faint outline in a crescent moon.

Sagredo holds that he considers the Earth noble because of the changes in it whereas Simplicio says that change in the Moon or stars would be useless because they do not benefit man. Salviati points out that days on the Moon are a month long and despite the varied terrain that the telescope has disclosed, it would not sustain life. Humans acquire mathematical truths slowly and hesitantly, whereas God knows the full infinity of them intuitively. And when one looks into the marvelous things men have understood and contrived, then clearly the human mind is one of the most excellent of God&#x27;s works.

===Day two===
The second day starts by repeating that Aristotle would be changing his opinions if he saw what they were seeing. &quot;It is the followers of Aristotle who have crowned him with authority, not he who has usurped or appropriated it to himself.&quot; There is one supreme motion—that by which the Sun, Moon, planets and fixed stars appear to be moved from east to west in the space of 24 hours. This may as logically belong to the Earth alone as to the rest of the universe. Aristotle and Ptolemy, who understood this, do not argue against any other motion than this diurnal one. Motion is relative: the position of the sacks of grain on a ship can be identical at the end of the voyage despite the movement of the ship. Why should we believe that nature moves all these extremely large bodies with inconceivable velocities rather than simply moving the moderately sized Earth? If the Earth is removed from the picture, what happens to all the movement?

The movement of the skies from east to west is the opposite of all the other motions of the heavenly bodies which are from west to east; making the Earth rotate brings it into line with all the others. Although Aristotle argues that circular motions are not contraries, they could still lead to collisions. The great orbits of the planets take longer than the shorter: Saturn and Jupiter take many years, Mars two, whereas the Moon takes only a month. Jupiter&#x27;s moons take even less. This is not changed if the Earth rotates every day, but if the Earth is stationary then we suddenly find that the sphere of the fixed stars rotates in 24 hours. Given the distances, that would more reasonably be thousands of years. In addition some of these stars have to travel faster than others: if the Pole Star was precisely at the axis, then it would be entirely stationary whereas those of the equator have unimaginable speed. The solidity of this supposed sphere is incomprehensible. Make the Earth the primum mobile and the need for this extra sphere disappears.
They consider three main objections to the motion of the Earth: that a falling body would be left behind by the Earth and thus fall far to the west of its point of release; that a cannonball fired to the west would similarly fly much further than one fired to the east; and that a cannonball fired vertically would also land far to the west. Salviati shows that these do not take account of the impetus of the cannon. He also points out that attempting to prove that the Earth does not move by using vertical fall commits the logical fault of paralogism (assuming what is to be proved), because if the Earth is moving then it is only in appearance that it is falling vertically; in fact it is falling at a slant, as happens with a cannonball rising through the cannon (illustrated).

In rebutting a work which claims that a ball falling from the Moon would take six days to arrive, the odd-number rule is introduced: a body falling 1 unit in an interval would fall 3 units in the next interval, 5 units in the subsequent one, etc. This gives rise to the rule by which the distance fallen is according to the square of the time. Using this he calculates the time is really little more than 3 hours. He also points out that density of the material does not make much difference: a lead ball might only accelerate twice as fast as one of cork. In fact, a ball falling from such a height would not fall behind but ahead of the vertical because the rotational motion would be in ever-decreasing circles. What makes the Earth move is similar to whatever moves Mars or Jupiter and is the same as that which pulls the stone to Earth. Calling it gravity does not explain what it is.

===Day three===

Salviati starts by dismissing the arguments of a book against the novas he has been reading overnight. Unlike comets, these were stationary and their lack of parallax easily checked and thus could not have been in the sublunary sphere. Simplicio now gives the greatest argument against the annual motion of the Earth that if it moves then it can no longer be the center of the zodiac, the world. Aristotle gives proofs that the universe is finite bounded and spherical. Salviati points out that these disappear if he denies him the assumption that it is movable, but allows the assumption initially in order not to multiply disputes.
Salviati points out that if anything is the center, it must be the Sun not the Earth, because all the planets are closer or further away from the Earth at different times, Venus and Mars up to eight times. He encourages Simplicio to make a plan of the planets, starting with Venus and Mercury which are easily seen to rotate about the Sun. Mars must also go about the Sun (as well as the Earth) since it is never seen horned, unlike Venus now seen through the telescope; similarly with Jupiter and Saturn. Earth, which is between Mars with a period of two years and Venus with nine months, has a period of a year which may more elegantly be attributed to motion than a state of rest.

Sagredo brings up two other common objections. If the Earth rotated, the mountains would soon be in a position that one would have to descend them rather than ascend. Secondly, the motion would be so rapid that someone at the bottom of a well would have only a brief instance to glimpse a star as it traversed. Simplicio can see that the first is no different from travelling over the globe, as any who have circumnavigated but though he realizes the second is the same as if the heavens were rotating, he still does not understand it. Salviati says the first is no different from those who deny the antipodes. For the second, he encourages Simplicio to decide what fraction of the sky can be seen from down the well.

Salviati brings up another problem, which is that Mars and Venus are not as variable as the theory would suggest. He explains that the size of a star to the human eye is affected by the brightness and the sizes are not real. This is resolved by use of the telescope which also shows the crescent shape of Venus. A further objection to the movement of the Earth, the unique existence of the Moon, has been resolved by the discovery of the moons of Jupiter, which would appear like Earth&#x27;s Moon to any Jovian.
Copernicus has succeeded in reducing some of the uneven motions of Ptolemy who had to deal with motions that sometimes go fast, sometimes slow, and sometimes backwards, by means of vast epicycles. Mars, above the Sun&#x27;s sphere, often falls far below it, then soars above it. These anomalies are cured by the annual movement of the Earth. This is explained by a diagram in which the varying motion of Jupiter is shown using the Earth&#x27;s orbit.

Simplicio produces another booklet in which theological arguments are mixed with astronomic, but Salviati refuses to address the issues from Scripture. So he produces the argument that the fixed stars must be at an inconceivable distance with the smallest larger than the whole orbit of the Earth. Salviati explains that this all comes from a misrepresentation of what Copernicus said, resulting in a huge over-calculation of the size of a sixth magnitude star. But many other famous astronomers over-estimated the size of stars by ignoring the brightness factor. Not even Tycho, with his accurate instruments, set himself to measure the size of any star except the Sun and Moon. But Salviati (Galileo) was able to make a reasonable estimate simply by hanging a cord to obscure the star and measuring the distance from eye to cord.

But still many cannot believe that the fixed stars can individually be as big or bigger than the Sun. To what end are these? Salviati maintains that &quot;it is brash for our feebleness to attempt to judge the reasons for God&#x27;s actions, and to call everything in the universe vain and superfluous which does not serve us&quot;.

Has Tycho or any of his disciples tried to investigate in any way phenomena that might affirm or deny the movement of the Earth? Do any of them know how much variation is needed in the fixed stars? Simplicio objects to conceding that the distance of the fixed stars is too great for it to be detectable. Salviati points out how difficult it is even to detect the varying distances of Saturn. Many of the positions of the fixed stars are not known accurately and far better instruments than Tycho&#x27;s are needed: say using a sight with a fixed position 60 miles away.

Sagredo then asks Salviati to explain how the Copernican system explains the seasons and inequalities of night and day. This he does with the aid of a diagram showing the position of the Earth in the four seasons. He points out how much simpler it is than the Ptolemaic system. But Simplicio thinks Aristotle was wise to avoid too much geometry. He prefers Aristotle&#x27;s axiom to avoid more than one simple motion at a time.

===Day four===

They are in Sagredo&#x27;s house in Venice, where tides are an important issue, and Salviati wants to show the effect of the Earth&#x27;s movement on the tides. He first points out the three periods of the tides: &quot;daily (diurnal)&quot;, generally with intervals of 6 hours of rising and six more of falling; &quot;monthly&quot;, seemingly from the Moon, which increases or decreases these tides; and &quot;annual&quot;, leading to different sizes at the equinoxes. He considers first the daily motion. Three varieties are observed: in some places the waters rise and fall without any forward motion; in others they move towards the east and back to the west without rising or falling; in still others there is a combination of both—this happens in Venice where the waters rise on entering and fall on leaving. In the Straits of Messina there are very swift currents between Scylla and Charybdis. In the open Mediterranean the alteration of height is small but the currents are noticeable.

Simplicio counters with the peripatetic explanations, which are based on the depths of the sea, and the dominion of the Moon over the water, though this does not explain the risings when the Moon is below the horizon. But he admits it could be a miracle. When the water in Venice rises, where does it come from? There is little rise in Corfu or Dubrovnik. From the ocean through the Straits of Gibraltar? It&#x27;s much too far away and the currents are too slow. So could the movement of the container cause the disturbance? Consider the barges that bring water into Venice. When they hit an obstacle, the water rushes forward; when they speed up it will go to the back. For all this disturbance there is no need for new water and the level in the middle stays largely constant though the water there rushes backwards and forwards.

Consider a point on the Earth under the joint action of the annual and diurnal movements. At one time these are added together and 12 hours later they act against each other, so there is an alternate speeding up and slowing down. So the ocean basins are affected in the same way as the barge particularly in an east-west direction. The length of the barge makes a difference to the speed of oscillations, just as the length of a plumb bob changes its speed. The depth of water also makes a difference to the size of vibrations. The primary effect only explains tides once a day; one must look elsewhere for the six-hour change, to the oscillation periods of the water. In some places, such as the Hellespont and the Aegean the periods are briefer and variable. But a north-south sea like the Red Sea has very little tide whereas the Messina Strait carries the pent up effect of two basins.

Simplicio objects that if this accounts for the water, should it not even more be seen in the winds? Salviati suggests that the containing basins are not so effective and the air does not sustain its motion. Nevertheless, these forces are seen by the steady winds from east to west in the oceans in the tropical zone. It seems that the Moon also is taking part in the production of the daily effects, but that is repugnant to his mind. The motions of the Moon have caused great difficulty to astronomers. It&#x27;s impossible to make a full account of these things given the irregular nature of the sea basins.

<text>Preference regression is a statistical technique used by marketers to determine consumers’ preferred core benefits. It usually supplements product positioning techniques like multi dimensional scaling or factor analysis and is used to create ideal vectors on perceptual maps.

==Application==
Starting with raw data from surveys, researchers apply positioning techniques to determine important dimensions and plot the position of competing products on these dimensions. Next they regress the survey data against the dimensions. The independent variables are the data collected in the survey. The dependent variable is the preference datum. Like all regression methods, the computer fits weights to best predict data. The resultant regression line is referred to as an ideal vector because the slope of the vector is the ratio of the preferences for the two dimensions.

If all the data is used in the regression, the program will derive a single equation and hence a single ideal vector. This tends to be a blunt instrument so researchers refine the process with cluster analysis. This creates clusters that reflect market segments. Separate preference regressions are then done on the data within each segment. This provides an ideal vector for each segment.

==Alternative methods==
Self-stated importance method is an alternative method in which direct survey data is used to determine the weightings rather than statistical imputations. A third method is conjoint analysis in which an additive method is used.

<text>&quot;Jedna si jedina&quot; (&#x27;You&#x27;re the One and Only&#x27;) was the national anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1992 and 1998.

==History==
The music was taken from the old Bosnian folk song &quot;S one strane Plive&quot; (&quot;On the far bank of the Pliva river&quot; or &quot;On the other side of the Pliva river&quot;), which was reportedly inspired by the Turkish song &quot;Sivastopol Marşı&quot;. The lyrics were written by Bosnian singer Dino Merlin; that version is featured on his 1993 album, &quot;Moja Bogda Sna&quot;. It was adopted in November 1992, several months after independence in March 1992. Political leaders of dominant Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat nationalist parties objected to it, and thus a new composition, the &quot;Intermezzo&quot;, was approved and adopted by the United Nations as the country&#x27;s national anthem in 1999.
===Legacy===
&quot;Jedna si jedina&quot; is still considered to be the &quot;de facto&quot; national anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina by many Bosniaks; many Bosniaks still sing this song during performances of the Bosnian national anthem, as they believe that it should still be current as the present national anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina does not have any official lyrics.

==Lyrics==
On most occasions, only the first verse followed by the chorus were performed.

<doc id="265014" wikidata="Q7733429" url="?curid=265014" title="The Faraway Tree">
<text>The Faraway Tree is a series of popular novels for children by British author Enid Blyton. The titles in the series are &quot;The Enchanted Wood&quot; (1939), &quot;The Magic Faraway Tree&quot; (1943), &quot;The Folk of the Faraway Tree&quot; (1946) and &quot;Up the Faraway Tree&quot; (1951).

The stories take place in an enchanted wood in which a gigantic magical tree grows – the eponymous &#x27;Faraway Tree&#x27;. The tree is so tall that its topmost branches reach into the clouds and it is wide enough to contain small houses carved into its trunk. The wood and the tree are discovered by three children who move into a house nearby. They befriend many of the residents and have adventures in magical lands that visit the top of the tree.

==Books==
The first title of the main trilogy, &quot;The Enchanted Wood&quot;, was published in 1939, although the Faraway Tree and Moon-Face had already made a brief appearance in 1936 in &quot;The Yellow Fairy Book&quot;. A picture-strip book, &quot;Up the Faraway Tree&quot;, was published in 1951. Over the years, the Faraway Tree stories have been illustrated by various artists including Dorothy M. Wheeler (first editions), Rene Cloke, Janet and Anne Grahame Johnstone, and Georgina Hargreaves.

===&quot;The Enchanted Wood&quot;===

In the first novel in the series, Jo, Bessie and Fanny (edited to Joe, Beth and Frannie in revised editions) move to live near a large forest, which the locals call &quot;The Enchanted Wood&quot;. One day they go for a walk in the wood and discover it really is enchanted. They encounter a group of elves who have been robbed of important papers by a gnome. They chase the gnome and recover the papers, but the gnome himself escapes up a huge tree whose branches seem to reach into the clouds. This is the Faraway Tree.

Against the elves&#x27; advice, the children climb the Faraway Tree. They discover that it is inhabited by magical people, including Moon-Face, Silky, The Saucepan Man, Dame Washalot, Mr. Watzisname, and the Angry Pixie, whose houses are carved into the trunk. They befriend some of these people, in particular Moon-Face and Silky. At the very top of the tree they discover a ladder which leads them to a magical land which is different on each visit, because each place moves on from the top of the tree to make way for a new land. The children are free to come and go, but they must leave before the land moves on, or they will be stuck there until that same land returns to the Faraway Tree. In various chapters, one of the children gets stuck in the land.

The lands at the top are sometimes extremely unpleasant – for example, the Land of Dame Slap (altered to Dame Snap in revised editions), an aggressive school teacher; and sometimes fantastically enjoyable – notably the Land of Birthdays, the Land of Goodies, the Land of Take-What-You-Want, and the Land of Do-As-You-Please.

The first land the three children visit is the Roundabout Land, in which everything turns constantly. They encounter a pair of rabbits, who dig a hole for the children to help them escape the land when they discover that the hole back to the tree had closed up after the ground turned above it. After several more adventures, the people of the Faraway Tree need the children&#x27;s help when they are invaded by an army of Red Goblins. The last land they visit in this book is the Land of Birthdays, where the brownies and the inhabitants of the Faraway Tree celebrate Bessie&#x27;s birthday.

===&quot;The Magic Faraway Tree&quot;===
Dick (later Rick), the cousin of Jo, Bessie and Fanny, comes to stay and he joins the secret adventures in the lands of the Faraway Tree. Dick is not interested at first, but later on he becomes interested and gets into mischief. Together they venture into many new lands and have a lot of fun. For example, in the Land of Goodies, some houses are made of chocolate.

===&quot;The Folk of the Faraway Tree&quot;===
Connie, a spoilt and stuck-up girl, comes to stay for the summer with the three children while her mother is sick. At first, Connie refuses to believe in the Faraway Tree or the magical folk who live in it, even when the Angry Pixie throws ink at her and when Dame Washalot soaks her. When the children visit the lands at the top of the tree, Connie gets a few surprises. The Saucepan Man&#x27;s mother decides to live in the tree, leaving her job as a baker in Dame Slap&#x27;s land. She sets up a surprising cake shop in the tree.

===&quot;Up the Faraway Tree&quot;===
Unlike the first three books in the series, this work is not a novel, but a series of illustrations with short text underneath. The plot follows two new children, Robin and Joy, who have read &quot;The Enchanted Wood&quot; and want to join in the adventures. They go to the wood to meet Jo, Bessie and Fanny and meet some of the wood&#x27;s residents, including Silky and Moon Face.

==Characters==
The main characters are Jo, Bessie and Fanny (updated in recent revisions to Joe, Beth and Frannie), who are three siblings. Fanny is the youngest, Bessie is next in age and Jo is their big brother. They live near the Enchanted Wood and are friends of the residents of the Faraway Tree. Other characters include:

* The Angry Pixie, who lives in a house with a tiny window and has a habit of throwing cold water or any liquid at hand over people who dare to peep inside;
* The barn owl, who lives in the house next to the Angry Pixie&#x27;s. He is a friend of Silky&#x27;s;
* Silky is so named because of her long, golden hair. She is one of the regular companions of the children when they go up the Tree to other worlds. Throughout the books, Silky is referred to as both an elf and a pixie. (When the children first meet Silky, she is described as an elf: ″At that moment the yellow door opened and a small elf looked out.″ Yet in the fourth book by Blyton, Up The Faraway Tree, Silky is introduced to Robin and Joy as a pixie: ″So Joy knocked—and the door flew open, and there stood little Silky the pixie...″);
* Mr. Watzisname cannot remember his name. He sleeps and snores all the time. During a particular story at the Land of Secrets, Mr. Watzisname discovers his name, Kollamoolitumarellipawkyrollo, then forgets it almost immediately as it is so long;
* Dame Washalot, who spends her time washing her clothes and throwing the dirty wash-water down the tree. If she has no clothes to wash, she washes the dirty laundry of other people and even the leaves of the Faraway Tree;
* Moon-Face is so named for his round face that looks like the moon. His house is similarly round and is filled with curved furniture. He is the owner of the slippery-slip, a slide which starts in the middle of his house which lets you slide down to the bottom of the Faraway Tree instead of climbing down. It is used as a means of exiting the tree and has played an important part in some of the adventures, where others have sought control of the tree or their rooms;
* The Saucepan Man, who lives with Mr. Watzisname. His name stems from the fact that he is covered all over with saucepans and kettles. Sometimes, he cannot understand what his friends are saying because he is partially deaf, which is further aggravated by all the noise from the pans and kettles which he carries all the time. In the cartoon series, he looks very similar to Horace and Jasper from the 1961 Disney film &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;. The Saucepan Man also appears in another, lesser-known Blyton book, &quot;The Book of Brownies&quot; (aka &quot;Brownie Tales&quot;), helping the travellers out of one of their many bouts of trouble on their journey;
* The Saucepan Man&#x27;s mother, who lives with Dame Washalot after &quot;The Folk of the Faraway Tree&quot;. She runs a cake shop;
* Dame Slap, who runs a school for bad pixies which, in some of the adventures, the friends accidentally land in. Her name has been updated in later revisions of the book to Dame Snap.

==Updates==
In modern reprints, the names of some of the characters have been changed. Jo has been changed to Joe, the more common spelling for males, and Bessie is now Beth, the former name having fallen out of use as a nickname for Elizabeth. Fanny and Dick have been renamed Frannie and Rick because in the United Kingdom and some countries in the Commonwealth of Nations they are now more widely used as slang terms for genitalia.

The supporting character Dame Slap has also become Dame Snap, and no longer practises corporal punishment but instead reprimands her students by shouting at them.

Entire passages of the original have been rewritten to remove references to fighting. For instance, when the tree is taken over by Goblins in &quot;The Enchanted Wood&quot;, the Goblins were originally fought off, with descriptions of Mr. Watzisname &#x27;pummelling them as if he were beating carpets&#x27; and the Saucepan Man throwing his saucepans at them. These have been replaced with cursory references to &#x27;chasing&#x27;. 

Some of the changes were criticised in a review by Alison Flood.

<text>&quot;God Bless Fiji&quot; is the national anthem of Fiji. It is in called &quot;Meda Dau Doka&quot; () in Fijian and &quot;Bhagavaan Fiji ko Aasheervaad Den&quot; (भगवान फिजी को आशीर्वाद दें) in Fiji Hindi. The lyrics were written by Michael Francis Alexander Prescott (1928–2006) to the tune of the hymn &quot;Dwelling in Beulah Land&quot; by Charles Austin Miles (1911), and the music was adapted by Viliame Bale, Superintendent and Director of Music in the Royal Fiji Police Band. The anthem was adopted upon independence from the United Kingdom in 1970.

== Lyrics ==
The anthem&#x27;s English version is usually sung. The English and Fijian lyrics are not translations of each other and have very little in common.

In August 2008, the draft version of the People&#x27;s Charter for Change, Peace and Progress, a government document intended to supplement the Constitution and reconcile ethnic and linguistic divides, suggested that the national anthem should be in the country&#x27;s three main languages: Fijian, Hindi and English. The Charter later served as the basis for the 2013 Constitution of Fiji.

<text>&quot;&quot; () is the national anthem of Gabon. Written and composed by politician Georges Aleka Damas, it was adopted upon independence in 1960.

== History ==
In a speech in Port-Gentil on 15 March 1962, President Léon M&#x27;ba stated his intention to have the national anthem translated into the various Gabonese dialects &quot;so that in the remotest village in the country everyone will be able to understand its meaning.&quot;

<text>&quot;For The Gambia Our Homeland&quot; is the national anthem of the Gambia. National anthem of the Gambia, written by Virginia Julia Howe and composed by Jeremy Frederic Howe , adopted after an international competition before independence in 1965

== History ==
In the lead-up to The Gambia&#x27;s independence from the United Kingdom on 18 February 1965, a National Anthem Selection Committee was set up to accept submissions for a national anthem for the country. The Committee would ultimately receive three submissions. One submission, by Reverend John Colley Faye, although acknowledged as &quot;superb&quot; in content, was rejected for being too long, with the Committee preferring something more to the point and easy to memorise.

Mandinka musician Jali Nyama Suso was approached by the government to compose an entry. He responded that he would base his proposal on a traditional Mandinka tune dedicated to Foday Kabba Dumbuya (or Fodee Kaba Dumbuya), a Muslim reformer and warrior remembered for his conquests for Islam, and a patron of Jali Nyama&#x27;s grandfather. Jali Nyama stated that basing national anthems on odes to local historical figures had been done in nearby Guinea and Mali. Jali Nyama wrote his own Mandinka lyrics to the tune.

Jali Nyama&#x27;s proposal was recorded and sent to be heard in the Prime Minister&#x27;s office in the Cabinet, where it was liked by Prime Minister Dawda Jawara. After it was also well received by Governor-General John Paul, it was sent to be translated into English by Jeremy Frederick Howe, Chairman of the Selection Committee. Howe was a member of the Gambia Colonial Service from 1954 to 1965, an Administrative Officer in the Ministry of Local Government. Howe would ultimately be credited for the composition of the anthem, while his wife, Virginia Julia Howe, a university-trained composer, would be credited for the English translation.

<doc id="265020" wikidata="Q275453" url="?curid=265020" title="Bai people">
<text>The Bai or Pai (Bai: , ; ), are an East Asian ethnic group native to the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province, Bijie area of Guizhou Province, and Sangzhi area of Hunan Province. The Bai constitute one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by China, with a population of 2,091,543 (as of 2020).

==Names==
The Bai people hold the colour white in high esteem and call themselves &quot;Baipzix&quot; (&#x27;, Baizi, 白子), &quot;Bai&#x27;ho&quot; (&#x27;, Baihuo, 白伙), &quot;Bai yinl&quot; (&quot;&quot;, Baini, 白尼), or &quot;Miep jiax&quot;. &quot;Bai&quot; means &quot;white&quot; in Chinese. Because of their strong preference for white, in 1956 the Chinese authorities named this ethnic group the Bai nationality.

The Bai were previously named the Minjia (民家) by the Chinese from the 14th century to 1949.

===Modern identity===
The Bai people are one of the most sinicized minorities in China. Although the Bai are technically one of China&#x27;s 56 official ethnic groups, it is difficult to qualify them as a distinct ethnic minority. As early as the 1940s, some rejected their non-Chinese origin and preferred to identify themselves solely as Chinese. The Bai ethnic label was not widely used or known until 1958. Today, the Bai people accept minority status for pragmatic reasons; however, they are culturally nearly indistinguishable from Han Chinese.

==Location==
The Bai predominantly reside in Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, as well as in Gucheng District and Yulong County of Lijiang City, Nanhua County of Chuxiong Prefecture, Xishan District, Wuhua District, and Anning City (Taiping Town) of Kunming City, Lushui County of Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, Longyang District of Baoshan City, Fengqing County of Lincang City, and portions of Zhenxiong County of Zhaotong City.

The Bai also constitute a hereditary ethnic group in Guizhou, Hunan, and Hubei Provinces, specifically in Bijie City, Liuzhi Special District, and Shucheng County within Liupanshui City in Guizhou; Sangzhi County in Zhangjiajie City in Hunan; and Hefeng County in Enshi Prefecture in Hubei.

==History==

The origin of the Bai people has been heavily debated over the past century, though those debates mainly focus on the groups of people who were assimilated. According to archaeological excavations around Lake Erhai, the Bai people may have originated in the area around the lake. The earliest human site, discovered in the early 20th century, was called the paleolithic Malong relics of Mt. Cangshan (苍山马龙遗址), dated circa 4000 BP. The late sites include Haimenkou of Jianchuan (剑川海门口, 3000 BP), Baiyangcun of Binchuan (宾川白羊村, 3500 BP), and Dabona of Xiangyun (祥云大波那, 2350 BP).

The Bai are mentioned in Tang dynasty texts as the &#x27;Bo (or Bai) People&#x27;. Assuming the Bo transcription is correct, the earliest mention of the Bai was in the third century BCE in a text called &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu (Spring and Autumn Annals of Master Lü Buwei).&quot; They were mentioned again in Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; in the first century BCE.

The Bai were one of the tribes that helped establish Nanzhao (649–902). In 937, the Dali Kingdom was founded by Duan Siping, a Bai man whose family had played a major role in the Nanzhao Kingdom, advocated for the &quot;relief of corvée&quot; () and joined 37 tribes in eastern Yunnan to instigate a rebellion. The Dali Kingdom persisted for about 300 years (937-1253), facilitating the Bai&#x27;s establishment of internal cohesion centered around the Erhai Lake.

In 1253, the Mongols led by Kublai Khan conquered the Dali Kingdom. The Yuan dynasty established Yunnan Province, created administrative districts in the Erhai region, and retained the Duan Family, the former rulers of Dali, to oversee the region.

In 1381, the Ming dynasty army defeated the Yuan forces, deposed the former ruler of Dali, instituted Dali Prefecture, and subsequently migrated to the Dali region to cultivate the land.

==Language==

As of 2004, only Bai people who lived in the mountains spoke Bai as their only language, but some Han Chinese in Dali also spoke Bai due to local influence. Among modern Bai people, Chinese is usually used for popular media such as radio, television, and news, while Bai is relegated to folk-arts related activities. No book in the Bai language has been published as of 2005.

The origins of the language have been obscured by many years of intensive Chinese influence. Several theories have been proposed, including categorizing it as a sister language of Chinese, a separate group within the Sino-Tibetan family, or in a category more related to the Thai language or Hmong language. Superficially, the Bai lexicon and grammar are closer to Chinese languages, but they also share common vocabulary items with the Lolo-Burmese languages.

According to the &quot;Manshu&quot; (Book of Barbarians) by Fan Chuo (9th century), the &quot;Baiman&quot;&#x27;s pronunciation of Chinese was the most accurate out of all the tribes in the area. Scriptures from Nanzhao unearthed in 1950s show that they were written in the Bai language (similar to Chữ Nôm and the Old Zhuang script) but it does not seem Nanzhao ever attempted to standardize or popularize the script. The same was true for its successor, the Dali Kingdom. During the Ming dynasty, the government began offering state examinations in Yunnan, which solidified Classical Chinese as the official language.

==Religion==

The habits of the Bai people in the Dali region closely resemble those of conventional Han Chinese culture. They are profoundly impacted by Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism.

=== Buddhism ===
Most Bai people adhere to a form of Buddhism known as Azhaliism.

Historically, the Dali Kingdom was the first Buddhist nation in Yunnan, excluding the Tibetan people in northwestern Yunnan. Buddhism was brought to the Bai people as early as the 8th century. The Bai people once practiced Mahayana Tantric Buddhism. After Wu Sangui&#x27;s Three Clans Rebellion, it was decisively quelled by the Qing Dynasty. Subsequently, the Buddhist beliefs of the Bai people were coercively supplanted by Chinese Hinayana Buddhism. Furthermore, the Bai people exhibit a strong interest in transcribing Buddhist scriptures. Notable locations such as the Thousand Search Pagoda at Chongsheng Temple, Fengyi North Tangtian Fazang Temple, the Three Pagodas of Chongsheng Temple, and the Fotu Temple have yielded various Buddhist texts, including the &quot;Diamond Sutra&quot;, &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, and &quot;Large Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras&quot;, among others.

=== Benzhuism ===
Although most Bai people adhere to Azhaliism, a form of Buddhism that traces its history back to the Nanzhao Kingdom, they also practice a native religion called Benzhuism: the worship of &quot;ngel zex&quot; (), local gods and ancestors. Ngel zex could be any hero in history—the prince of the Nanzhao regime, a hero of folklore or even a tiger (for instance, Laojun Jingdi is a tiger).

=== Christianity===
George Clarke, who arrived in 1881, was the first Protestant missionary to the Bai population. Few Bai individuals adhere to the Christian faith; yet, Christian churches exist in Dali.

=== Islam ===
There are a few villages in Yunnan where residents are Muslims, but speak Bai as their first language. These people are officially classified by Chinese authorities as belonging to the Hui nationality and call themselves &quot;Bai Hui&quot; (&quot;Bai-speaking Muslims&quot;). They usually say that their ancestors were Hui people, who came to Yunnan as followers of the Mongolian army in the 14th century.

==Culture==
===Gender===
Gender roles were relatively equal in Bai society and women were not considered inferior to men. Having only daughters and no sons was not considered a tragedy.

===Agriculture===

Most Bai are agriculturalists. They cultivate many crops like rice, wheat, rapeseed, sugar, millet, cotton, cane, corn, and tobacco. However, some Bai also engage in fishing and selling local handicrafts to tourists. Most Bai were subsistence rice farmers, but they also cultivated wheat, vegetables, and fruits. Unlike the Han and most other Chinese minority groups, the Bai ate cheese and made it from either cow or goat milk. The leftover whey from the process of cheese-making was fed to pigs. Those who lived around Erhai Lake fished.

Bai fishermen have trained cormorants to fish since the 9th century. Lower water quality and high costs of cormorant training have resulted in recent disuse of the practice, though cormorant fishing is still done by local fishers today for tourists.

=== Cuisine ===

The Bai people enjoy sour, cold and spicy flavours and excel in preparing delicacies such as cured gammon, bowfish (&quot;Zacco taliensis&quot;), river snails sauce, fried termite mushrooms (&quot;Termitomyces&quot;) and pork liver. The Bai people of Dali and surrounding regions enjoy a distinctive dish known as &quot;raw meat&quot; or &quot;raw skin,&quot; which consists of pork that is roasted to a medium doneness, then sliced or shredded, and served with ginger, green onions, vinegar, and chilli peppers to entertain guests.

Additionally, there are white wines produced from glutinous rice, &quot;snow plums&quot; crafted from stewed plums and sugar from Cang Mountain, as well as Dengchuan&#x27;s distinctive &quot;milk fan&quot; and &quot;milk cake&quot;, all of which are exceptionally flavourful.

===Bai tie-dye ===

Bai tie-dye () is extensively utilised in Bai apparel, everyday items, traditional folklore, religious ceremonies, and national celebrations. The primary stages of tie-dyeing consist of flower tying and dyeing, with the essential techniques being the twisting and tying approach along with the dyeing process. The essence of the technique is in the dying method and the proficiency in dyeing. The primary instruments for tie-dyeing include the dyeing jar, dyeing stick, sun rack, and stone mill.

Zhoucheng, Dali () offers a diverse array of tie-dye items, featuring over 1,000 distinct patterns characterised by a broad spectrum of themes and profound meanings.

===Clothing===

The Bai people, as their name would suggest, favor white clothes and decorations. Women generally wear white dresses, sleeveless jackets of red, blue, or black, embroidered belts, loose trousers, embroidered shoes of white cloth, and jewelry made of gold or silver. Women in Dali traditionally wear a white coat trimmed with a black or purple collar, loose blue trousers, embroidered shoes, silver bracelets, and earrings. Unmarried women wear a single pigtail on the top of their head, while married women roll their hair. The men wear white jackets, black-collared coats, and dark loose shorts. Their headwear and costume reflect the Bai symbols: the snow, the moon, the flower, and the wind.

Many Bai women style their hair in a long braid wrapped in a headcloth. This style is called &quot;the phoenix bows its head&quot;.

===Arts===
The Bai have a traditional form of theater called &quot;Chuichuiqiang&quot;. However, this local tradition is endangered, as is traditional Bai culture in general.

==Festivals==

===Raosanlin and Horse-racing===

The three major Bai festivals are called the Raosanlin (Walking Around Three Souls). The most important one is the Third Month Fair, held annually at the foot of Mount Cang in Dali between the fifteenth and twentieth days of the third lunar month. Originally, it was a religious activity to rally and pay homage, but it gradually evolved into a fair that included performances of traditional sports and dance as well as the trade of merchandise from different regions. The second festival is the Shibaoshan Song Festival, and the third is the Torch Festival, held on the 25th day of the sixth lunar month to wish health and a good harvest. On that evening, the countryside is decorated with banners with auspicious words written upon them. Villagers then light torches in front of their gates and walk around the fields while holding yet more torches in order to catch pests.

Horse racing is a customary practice of the Bai people, conducted not only during the Third Month Fair but also at the Mule-and-Horse Meeting in Jianchuan in July, the Fish Pone Meeting in Eryuan and Dengchuan in August, and in several villages. The origins of Bai horse racing date back over a millennium to the Tang Dynasty, coinciding with the introduction of Buddhism to Nanzhao. The Guanyin Temple Fair, conducted at the base of Cang Mountain in March of the lunar calendar, has progressively transformed into the Third Month Fair and associated commercial activities. Initially, the market primarily focused on the exchange of medical herbs and cattle. To further their business, horse sellers arranged horse-riding competitions at the market to showcase the strength and speed of the horses. Horse racing has consequently become a significant aspect of Third Month Fair. Annually, during the festival, the Bai and other ethnic groups, like the Tibetans and Nakhi, convene from across the globe in ceremonial clothing with their horses to engage in horse-racing.

===Tea ceremony===
The Bai tea ceremony, San Dao Cha 三道茶 (Three Course Tea), is most popular among the Bai in the Dali area and is a common sight at festivals and marriages. It is both a cultural ceremony and a method of honouring a guest. The ceremony is often described in Mandarin as &#x27;Yiku, Ertian, sanhuiwei&#x27; 一苦二甜三回味 (First is bitter, Second is sweet, Third brings reflection (aftertaste)).

The first tea course starts with baking the tea leaves in a clay pot over a small flame, shaking the leaves often while they bake. When they turn slightly brown and give off a distinct fragrance, heated water is added to the pot. The water should immediately begin bubbling. When the bubbling ceases, a small amount of bitterly fragrant, concentrated tea remains. Due to the sound the hot water makes when it enters the clay pot, the first course tea was, in previous times, also known as Lei Xiang Cha 雷响茶 (Sound of Thunder Tea).

The second course is sweet tea. Pieces of walnut kernel and roasted rushan (乳扇, lit. &quot;milk fan&quot;), a dried cheese specific to the Dali region, are put into a tea cup with brown sugar and other ingredients. Boiling water is added and the tea is then offered to the guest. This tea is sweet without being oily, so the guest can easily drink it.

The third tea is made by mixing honey, Sichuan pepper, slices of ginger, and cassia together in a china cup with hot Cangshan Xue green tea. The product is a tea that is sweet, coarse and spicy all at once. This Dali specialty has a noticeable aftertaste, which meant it was known as Hui Wei Cha 回味茶 (Reflection Tea).

The 18 procedures of the tea ceremony are governed by strict etiquette, which follows the principles of etiquette, honesty, and beauty. As such, the tea ceremony is considered by some to perfectly embody the hospitable Bai people&#x27;s current customs.

==Architecture==

The Bai people have developed and preserved three distinctive architectural styles that reflect their unique traditions and craftsmanship. These styles include the &quot;one house with two cottages,&quot; &quot;three rooms and one wall screening,&quot; and &quot;four houses and five courtyards.&quot; Each of these architectural designs showcases not only the structural layout but also the intricate decorative elements that are characteristic of Bai architecture. The Bai homes, with their white walls, hexagonal tile patterns, colorful paintings, and elaborate decorations like carved wooden doors, exemplify the attention to detail and artistic flair that define Bai architectural aesthetics.

The village of Xizhou is known for its preservation of Qing Dynasty-era Bai homes, with some of these structures repurposed into museums. The Three Pagodas of Chongsheng Temple, dating back to the period between 823 and 840 AD, are recognized as significant architectural landmarks attributed to the Bai people. The central pagoda, standing at a height surpassing 70 meters in Dali, ranks among the tallest structures of similar kind in China, highlighting the architectural achievements associated with the Bai community.

<doc id="265023" wikidata="Q525325" url="?curid=265023" title="Battle of Dyrrhachium (48 BC)">
<text>The Battle of Dyrrachium (or Dyrrhachium) took place from April to late July 48 BC near the city of Dyrrachium, modern day Durrës in what is now Albania. It was fought between Gaius Julius Caesar and an army led by Gnaeus Pompey during Caesar&#x27;s civil war.

Caesar attempted to capture the vital Pompeian logistics hub of Dyrrachium but was unsuccessful after Pompey occupied it and the surrounding heights. In response, Caesar besieged Pompey&#x27;s camp and constructed a circumvallation thereof, until, after months of skirmishes, Pompey was able to break through Caesar&#x27;s fortified lines, forcing Caesar to make a strategic retreat into Thessaly.

After the battle, Pompey pursued Caesar into Thessaly and then towards Pharsalus, where the decisive battle of Caesar&#x27;s Greek campaign would be fought.

== Background ==
Starting in 49 BC, Julius Caesar had crossed the Rubicon and started a civil war in the Roman Republic. Starting in January with a lightning advance against the Pompeian and senatorial forces in Italy, Pompey withdrew across the Adriatic for Rome&#x27;s eastern provinces. Following Caesar&#x27;s defeat of Pompey&#x27;s legates in Spain, Caesar turned east and crossed the Adriatic in January 48 BC.

As Pompey raised troops in the east, Caesar needed to strike quickly: he moved some his troops across the Adriatic but was intercepted, stranding him with seven legions in Greece while the rest of his army remained in Brundisium under Mark Antony. Seeking supplies, Caesar attempted to seize Dyrrachium – a major Pompeian supply hub – but withdrew when Pompey arrived in the city first. In early April, Antony and his reinforcements were able to join Caesar&#x27;s manoeuvres against Pompey outside Dyrrachium.

== Siege ==
Caesar first attempted to offer battle with Pompey, but was rebuffed, with Pompey seeking to wear down Caesar&#x27;s forces with hunger; in response, Caesar attempted again to capture Dyrrachium, which remained logistically vital.

At Dyrrachium, Pompey held a strong defensive position; his back was guarded by the sea, and at his front there were hills that commanded the immediate area. There, Pompey established his camp on the top of a rocky outcrop called Petra overlooking a natural harbour from which he could be resupplied by sea. Caesar&#x27;s camp, however, was on high ground inland, which forced his troops to rely on forage. Caesar started a circumvallation: to prevent Pompey from getting fodder for his animals, to render his cavalry ineffective and thus protect his own foraging parties, and to reduce Pompey&#x27;s standing in the eyes of the foreigners and his own men by putting him on the defensive and making him openly refuse battle. In response, Pompey also started construction of a fortified line facing Caesar. On completion, the interior Pompeian line stretched some fifteen Roman miles with twenty-four forts, while Caesar&#x27;s exterior line stretched some 17 miles.

While Caesar lacked for food during the winter – reckoning by natural seasons rather than the out-of-sync Roman calendar – he cut off the streams sustaining the Pompeian water supply; the supply situation led to outbreaks of camp disease as well. As Caesar continued his fortified encirclement, hoping to force Pompey either to withdraw by sea, break out, or watch his army wither away, skirmishes and raids against the fortified lines continued. 

Pompey decided to try and lure Caesar away from the fortifications by means of a false message that some of the inhabitants of Dyrrachium were prepared to betray the town to him, and meanwhile launch a three-pronged attack against forts in the centre of the siege-line. At two of these forts one cohort under Lucius Minucius Basilus and three cohorts under Gaius Volcatius Tullus put up stiff resistance against five of Pompey&#x27;s legions until they were relieved by a force of two legions from the main camp under Publius Cornelius Sulla. The Pompeians became cut off on a hill-top between the two lines for five days before Pompey could withdraw them. Caesar reckoned the Pompeian losses at two thousand.

It was difficult, however, for Caesar&#x27;s forces to hold a longer line than his numerically superior enemy, leading him to deploy aggressively before, but out of range of, the enemy walls: Pompey was forced similarly to respond with a similar force concentration.

==Battle==

When two Gallic chieftain auxiliaries defected from Caesar to Pompey with their retinues, Pompey discovered a weakness in the southernmost sector of Caesar&#x27;s lines and prepared for a major attack to break through Caesar&#x27;s fortified lines. The initial attack was successful, and the position only held when Antony brought up twelve cohorts, followed by further reserves led by Caesar personally. While the Ninth&#x27;s fort held, Pompey built a camp in the area and also secured lines of communication into the hinterland.

After Pompey&#x27;s forces occupied a relatively exposed fortified encampment that had previously been abandoned by the Caesarians, Caesar launched an attack against it. The attack, plagued by confused directions, was a costly failure for Caesar, sending his men into a hasty retreat with losses of some 960 men and more than 32 officers. While Pompey held the field, he ordered a halt. Caesar remarked on that decision saying, &quot;[Pompey&#x27;s forces] would have won today, if only they were commanded by a winner&quot;. 

In the aftermath, Titus Labienus, a trusted lieutenant of Caesar&#x27;s during the Gallic wars who had deserted to Pompey at the start of the civil war, had the Caesarian prisoners executed before the enemy lines. 

==Aftermath==

Tactically, Caesar&#x27;s position was substantially weakened: Pompey had captured one of the ends of his fortified line and Caesar would not be able to construct an even longer line to encircle Pompey&#x27;s extended fortifications. In response, Caesar withdrew to Apollonia under cover of darkness, leaving two legions to deceive the Pompeians into thinking they were still present. When this was discovered, Pompey sent cavalry in pursuit, but they were held off in a skirmish with Caesar&#x27;s rear-guard.

By this time it was summer and Caesar made way for areas not yet visited by foraging parties, meaning that they would be able to support more prolonged operations. After being denied entrance to Gomphi by its city magistrates, who did not want to aid a leader seemingly likely to lose the war, Caesar had his men sack the city as a successful example of ruthlessness.

In a broader sense, the Pompeians elated at the victory, being the first time in the civil war that Caesar had suffered a non-trivial defeat. Men like Domitius Ahenobarbus urged Pompey to bring Caesar to decisive battle and crush him; others urged a return to Rome and Italy to retake the capital. Pompey remained steadfast in believing that committing to a pitched battle was both unwise and unnecessary, deciding on strategic patience to wait for reinforcements from Syria and to exploit Caesar&#x27;s weak supply lines. The elation of victory turned into overconfidence and mutual suspicion, putting significant pressure on Pompey to provoke a final encounter with the enemy. Beginning to place too much trust in his forces and under the influence of overconfident officers, he chose to engage Caesar in Thessaly shortly after being reinforced from Syria.

<doc id="265027" wikidata="Q273260" url="?curid=265027" title="God Bless Our Homeland Ghana">
<text>&quot;God Bless Our Homeland Ghana&quot; is the national anthem of Ghana; it was adopted in 1957 when Ghana declared its independence from the United Kingdom.

==History==
The music for the national anthem was originally composed by Philip Gbeho and sung to lyrics written by Emmanuel Pappoe-Thompson. However the words were revised by a literary committee in the Office of the then head of state, Kwame Nkrumah. Michael Kwame Gbordzoe has made claims to the current lyrics being used saying that it was written by him after the overthrow of President Nkrumah. A competition was held and Kwame Gbordzoe, who was then a student at Bishop Herman College, presented the current lyrics which were chosen to replace &quot;Lift High The Flag Of Ghana&quot; which had been officially adopted after independence and used as Ghana&#x27;s national anthem during Nkrumah&#x27;s presidency.

== Lyrics ==
=== Current lyrics ===
The current lyrics of the &quot;God Bless Our Homeland Ghana&quot; national anthem that has been in use since the 1970s were written by Michael Kwame Gbordzoe while a student within the framework of a national competition, and is accompanied by Ghana&#x27;s national pledge.

Thus, the official current lyrics of &quot;God Bless Our Homeland Ghana&quot; are as follows:

Thus, although Philip Gbeho’s composition is still being used, the current lyrics beginning &quot;God Bless our Homeland Ghana&quot; do not originate from him.

Michael Kwame Gbordzoe, who became a scientist by profession, has drawn the attention of the Ghana Government to the fact that although his lyrics have been adopted for the country’s national anthem since the 1970s, there has so far been no official Ghana Government recognition for his work, which may be attributed to the abrupt changes in regimes in Ghana in the past.

Messages were sent to various Ghanaian government agencies, and was also discussed on air at the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation (GBC), Uniiq FM programme &quot;PTGlive&quot;, on 9 March 2008.

===National Pledge of Ghana===
The National Pledge of Ghana is recited immediately after &quot;God Bless Our Homeland Ghana&quot;.

<doc id="265028" wikidata="Q1211840" url="?curid=265028" title="The Books of Magic">
<text>The Books of Magic is the title of a four-issue English-language comic book mini-series written by Neil Gaiman, published by DC Comics, and later an ongoing series under the imprint Vertigo. Since its original publication, the mini-series has also been published in a single-volume collection under the Vertigo imprint with an introduction by author Roger Zelazny. It tells the story of a young boy who has the potential to become the world&#x27;s greatest magician.

==Miniseries==
&quot;The Books of Magic&quot; began life when DC Comics decided to highlight some of their mystical characters across the range. They initially approached writer J. M. DeMatteis to script a prose book with illustrations from Jon J Muth, Kent Williams, Dave McKean and others, but when it reached the stage of confirming the artists&#x27; involvement, the suggested artists all declined to be involved. At that stage, DeMatteis also decided to step back, and DC instead approached popular writer Neil Gaiman and asked him to come up with a four-issue prestige-format series &quot;about our magic characters&quot;. Drawing on a childhood spent working his way through the children&#x27;s section in his local library and a childhood love of magic and fantasy stories such as T. H. White&#x27;s &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;, Gaiman created an everyman character of a twelve-year-old boy, called Timothy Hunter, who would need to be given an extensive tour of the DC magical universe before being able to decide if he should embrace or reject his destiny as the world&#x27;s greatest magician.

Gaiman used the four issues to formally split the structure of the story and allow for a different artist to draw each issue:
* In &quot;Book I: The Invisible Labyrinth&quot; (artwork by John Bolton), Tim is introduced to the history of the DC Universe by the Phantom Stranger.
* In &quot;Book II: The Shadow World&quot; (artwork by Scott Hampton), he is taken around the present world by John Constantine.
* In &quot;Book III: The Land of Summer&#x27;s Twilight&quot; (artwork by Charles Vess) he visits Faerie, Gemworld, Skartaris, King Arthur&#x27;s Camelot, Hell, and the other mystical realms with Doctor Occult.
* In &quot;Book IV: The Road to Nowhere&quot; (artwork by Paul Johnson) he travels to a possible future of the universe with Mister E.

This structure allowed Gaiman great scope to include various magical characters from across DC&#x27;s ranges, as well as reintroducing characters that weren&#x27;t currently in print. In his introduction to the collected edition, author Roger Zelazny also noted that the structure bore some similarity to the key story points of the mythic structure identified by Joseph Campbell&#x27;s &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; - although he did allow that this might come from Gaiman&#x27;s intimate knowledge of the same source material rather than a deliberate attempt to follow Campbell&#x27;s guidelines. When the book was initially released over 1990/91, it proved very popular and led Vertigo Executive Editor Karen Berger to make it a regular ongoing series under editor Stuart Moore.

==Ongoing series==
Tim Hunter made the ultimate choice to pursue magic in the &quot;Mister E&quot; miniseries by K. W. Jeter when he was forced to use magic to prevent Mister E from killing him. He was aided in this decision by The Phantom Stranger, Doctor Fate, and Zatanna.

Berger struggled to find a writer suitable for the project, however, with writers like Dick Foreman struggling to handle the character of Tim. Berger eventually approached John Ney Rieber after having seen some of his work, convinced that he would be able to meet the challenge of developing Tim into a fully rounded character. Rieber was asked to come up with a story outline for the proposed series, but these were rejected by Berger and DC. Still convinced that Rieber was the writer for the job, however, Berger asked him to persevere: he tried &quot;several times to come up with something different, but it still didn&#x27;t thrill anyone&quot;. At one point, Rieber himself tried to withdraw from the project, but Berger was still convinced that he could do it, and when the Vertigo &quot;The Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot; event was being planned, she asked him to write one of the chapters to reintroduce Tim to the DC universe.

The &quot;Arcana: The Books of Magic Annual&quot; was the sixth part of &quot;The Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot; series, with artwork by Peter Gross. It introduced several characters created by Rieber that would be developed in the later ongoing series, such as Tim&#x27;s biological father Tamlin, as well as starting off some of the ongoing book&#x27;s storylines. The annual saw Neil Gaiman&#x27;s first credit as &quot;creative consultant&quot; for &quot;The Books of Magic&quot;, a position which DC Comics paid him to carry out despite the fact that even when he did make comments on the script, he was told that it was too late for anything to be changed.

By the time the series launched, the name had returned to &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; and a regular rotating team of artists Gross, Gary Amaro and Peter Snejbjerg was put in place to provide artwork for alternating storylines. In early 1997, Rieber announced to Peter Gross that he was going to leave the comic. Gross attributed this to Rieber&#x27;s growing dislike of the comic&#x27;s central character, which Rieber seemingly confirmed in his &quot;Afterward&quot; for his final issue, saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve found it difficult to like Tim now and then. Of course he gets on my nerves. He&#x27;s a lot like someone I spent years learning not to be&quot;. Rieber&#x27;s last issue was issue #50, coincidentally the point at which original co-creator Neil Gaiman decided that the time was right to stop &quot;taking DC&#x27;s $200 an issue and not doing anything&quot; and resigned as creative consultant on the book.

With Rieber leaving, the series editor Stuart Moore championed Gross to take over scripting duties because &quot;I knew he could do it. He&#x27;s got a great sense of story and character&quot;. Gross initially wrote a short memo detailing where he thought the series should go, hoping that it might influence the editors&#x27; choice of writer. Gross was then asked if he could expand his ideas into an actual story, and he plotted a six issue story that he thought might be used as a &quot;filler&quot; until a new writer could be found. DC encouraged him to think bigger until, by the time he started writing his first issue, he had plotted out a 23-issue-long story for the book. This soon expanded into plots for Gross&#x27; entire 25-issue run, despite Gross initially being nervous that his writing efforts would be unfavorably compared to those of Gaiman and Rieber by the series&#x27; fans.

As well as writing, Gross continued to provide artwork for the book, juggling this with a separate career teaching a class in Comic Illustration at Minneapolis College of Art and Design. Despite this, he still attempted to write full scripts for each issue, saying: &quot;I like working that way so I can kind of forget about it before I sit down to draw. So when I draw it, I can think of it as something I didn’t write almost&quot;. This sometimes caused difficulties for Gross, and guest artists were used frequently to help lighten the load - and on one occasion, Peter Hogan was brought in to write a filler issue that gave Gross more time to catch up.

From the beginning of Gross&#x27; run, there were tentative plans for the comic to rest after it reached its 75th issue. Such a break would be used to allow the character of Tim Hunter to grow up a little before resuming his story - Gross had ideas for this later run to explore the character&#x27;s relationship with the women in his life, through his relationship with his late mother. However, when the 75th issue was reached, Gross decided to move away from the book, and instead DC announced that Dylan Horrocks would continue Tim&#x27;s story in a five-issue mini-series called &quot;Names of Magic&quot; after a short break symbolizing Tim&#x27;s readiness to face his destiny. A new mini-series was followed by a new ongoing monthly series, which was eventually presented as &quot;&quot;.

==Storylines==

===Neil Gaiman===
The original mini-series concentrated on Timothy Hunter&#x27;s introduction to the world of magic by the Trenchcoat Brigade (the Phantom Stranger, Doctor Occult, Mister E, and John Constantine), who are aware that the boy has the potential to be the world&#x27;s greatest magician but that his allegiance to good or evil is undecided. Equally, he could turn from the world of magic completely and be lost to either side. The Trenchcoat Brigade see it as their duty to resolve the uncertainty around Tim&#x27;s fate one way or another.

They take him from the birth of the universe all the way through to its eventual death, ostensibly teaching him about the possibilities - and the price - of wielding magic before he decides whether to embrace his destiny. Along the way, Tim meets some of the DCU&#x27;s more prominent magicians and fantasy characters, such as Merlin, Zatara, Doctor Fate, The Spectre, Madame Xanadu, Doctor Thirteen, Zatanna, Dream, John Constantine, Cain and Abel, Destiny, and Death, whilst his allies try to protect him from the machinations of the Cult of the Cold Flame. Following his misadventures, Tim decides that the price is too high, only to find that everything he has learnt from his supposed mentors has made it impossible for him to turn away from magic.

===John Ney Rieber===
====Finding Tim&#x27;s parents====
As John Ney Rieber began the ongoing series, he used the stories to focus on telling Tim&#x27;s story: he summed up his run later by saying &quot;&quot;The Books of Magic&quot; aren&#x27;t about Cool. They&#x27;re about Tim&quot;. His first storyline, &quot;Bindings&quot;, for example ostensibly showed Tim discovering that since the realm of Faerie had cut itself off from Tim&#x27;s world (the Mundane world) it was withering and dying - something that Titania hid from her people by using powerful glamours, but that Tim managed to permanently cure by &quot;opening&quot; the realm again to the Earth. However, this story was merely the backdrop to a more personal story for Tim, as he discovered that the Falconer Tamlin (who kidnapped Tim during the events of the &quot;Arcana: The Books of Magic Annual&quot;) was actually his true father, and that the Faerie Queen Titania might be his mother: this revelation first appeared in a gaming guide to the DC Universe, possibly misinterpreting a scene in the original miniseries where Titania refers to Tim as &quot;my son&quot;.

&quot;Bindings&quot; also brings Tim into conflict with a Manticore, who attempts to convince Tim of the non-existence of magic before hunting and killing him. Tim revives and releases a unicorn that has been similarly hunted, and destroys the Manticore - but not before he is poisoned by it. The boy nearly dies, until his father Tamlin performs a magic ritual which allows him to die in Tim&#x27;s place. The boy recovers and returns to Earth with Titania&#x27;s curses in his ears, having to come to terms with the revelation that the people he thought of as his parents - a mother who died in a car crash caused by his one-armed, grieving father - might be no relation to him at all.

Partly the Faerie storyline in &quot;Bindings&quot; was written to appease DC&#x27;s desire for a &quot;big&quot; story to launch the new series with: Rieber&#x27;s original starting point was to be the &quot;Summonings&quot; storyline instead, introducing Tim&#x27;s first girlfriend Molly O&#x27;Reilly and demonstrating the writer&#x27;s desire that the stories should be about &quot;a realm that has never been mapped by the Royal Geographic Society and never will be. People who&#x27;ve lost touch with the place call it &#x27;Adolescence&#x27;&quot;.

Rieber&#x27;s run also contained several stories about the need to stay connected with the world that they live in. Several of his characters, including Tim, seek to avoid their problems in the real world by escaping into fantasy, but Rieber later explained that &quot;wishing never solves anything in the Books. Have you noticed? At best, it gets you into trouble. About the only thing you can do in the Books that&#x27;s more dangerous than wishing is surrendering to fantasies that others have constructed&quot;. The first of these characters living in another&#x27;s fantasy is introduced in &quot;The Hidden School&quot;: playing on the suggestion in the original miniseries that Tim could grow to be a force for good or for evil, Rieber introduces a future version of the magician - Sir Timothy Hunter - who has tortured multiple versions of Molly all his life after coming under the sway of the demon Barbatos. Sir Timothy is under the mistaken impression that he is Barbatos&#x27; master and that he lives in grand luxury, when in truth Barbatos is manipulating him for his own ends and Sir Timothy lives in a cardboard box in a back alley.

Sir Timothy and Barbatos return to Tim&#x27;s time from 2012 because Tim is the last boy in the multiverse who could possibly grow up to be Sir Timothy, and they intend to ensure that he does. Their plans are thwarted without Tim even being aware of them, as he has a guardian angel called Araquel who is chained between Heaven and Hell for having had a daughter called Nikki with Khara. Khara defeats Sir Timothy on Tim&#x27;s behalf. The intervention doesn&#x27;t mean that Tim is safe, however, as he has come to the attention of the last member of the Cult of the Cold Flame, a magician called Martyn.
Martyn attempts to seduce Tim into becoming his servant using a succubus called Leah, using magic to make Tim&#x27;s father spontaneously combust so that the boy is alone and vulnerable. Tim is saved once from Leah by the arrival of Molly, as the succubus is touched by the genuine love between the two... but in his grief and anger, Tim manages to push Molly away and cause Leah to think he is &quot;just like all other men&quot; and needs punishing. Tim&#x27;s salvation from Martyn comes in an unlikely form when Sir Timothy and Barbatos kill the magician to protect their own interests in the boy. This leaves Leah without a master, a position that she attempts to make Tim fill before the young magician proves his worth by setting her free. She leaves England to see where her new freedom - and Martyn&#x27;s car - will take her.

The next story arc followed on almost directly from the &quot;Arcana Annual&quot;, bringing back two of the children of Free Country: Daniel, the chimney sweep, and Marya, the girl who was sent to bring Tim to Free Country but decided to stay in the real world after she did. Marya has become friends with Molly, and gets invited on her and Tim&#x27;s first date - but panics Tim when she tells Molly that her boyfriend is a magician, causing him to accidentally freeze them both with magic. He eventually manages to unfreeze them again, but fall prey to a monster of black, choking soot.

The monster is Daniel, expelled from Free Country and transformed by the Victorian era cyborg the Reverend Slagingham. Slagingham is collecting an army of down-and-outs, capturing their souls in magical contraptions: one of his minions, Gwendolyn, even manages to trick the Faerie King Auberon into surrendering his soul, leaving Titania&#x27;s husband her helpless servant. The Reverend falls foul to Tim thanks to the intervention of one of his childhood imaginary friends made real, Awn the Blink, who has an amazing knack for fixing broken things. Daniel, meanwhile, gives up his attack when Marya rejects his affections. All that remains is for Tim to help return Auberon&#x27;s soul to his body and return him, changed by his experiences, to his wife&#x27;s side. For his trouble, Auberon tells Tim that Titania cannot possibly be his mother, since the boy has &quot;not a drop&quot; of Faerie blood in him. This is something never resolved in &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; themselves, and Auberon&#x27;s observation proves nothing since &quot;The Books of Faerie&quot; series tells that Titania, herself, is actually human and not fairie.

====Relationships and tattoos====
Gwendolyn decides to stay and look after Tim while his father makes a miraculous recovery at the hands of the strange Mister Vasuki, eventually returning home after sharing a taxi with a young mother and her son Cyril.

Tim learns that he is an &quot;Opener&quot; and has unconsciously been making his fantasies real all his life—whether they be simple imaginary friends or entire worlds—Tim introduces Molly to some more of his imaginary friends made real, Tanger and Crimple, who live in a tree on some wasteland near Tim&#x27;s house. The wasteland opens out into an entire magical world created unconsciously by Tim&#x27;s childhood fantasies, but as Molly is exploring it with Crimple she ends up being kidnapped and taken to Hell.

Tanger and Tim head into Hell to rescue Molly and Crimple, who are being held by the strict governess Miss Vuall - the trainer of the multiple Mollies who are Sir Timothy Hunter&#x27;s docile and dutiful companions. Sir Timothy, however, no longer needs the girls, as he has succeeded in releasing himself from Barbatos&#x27; control - only to be persuaded by a gang of dragons to become one of them because of his sadness and self-hatred. Molly and Crimple best Miss Vuall, and as Tim arrives the two children&#x27;s love puts the finishing touches to her corner of Hell. Barbatos drags the children and the dragon Sir Timothy into another layer of Hell, where he attempts to salvage victory from defeat by trapping the two children in a fairy tale world where brave knights kill dragons.

Meeting the real Molly again, Sir Timothy is overcome with guilt and tells her his life story in the hope that she can prevent her Tim from becoming him. Tim, meanwhile, manages to see through all of Barbatos&#x27; attempts to trick him, and eventually brings the fairy tale world crashing down around their ears. Sir Timothy dies protecting Molly from the destruction unleashed by Tim, and the two children are reunited. As they return home, they leave Barbatos trapped in the ruins of the world he created, although he does briefly escape again.
Following Molly and Tim&#x27;s disappearance, both find themselves grounded and banned from seeing each other. Molly manages to sneak out and ends up around a camp-fire discussing Tim with Marya and a mysterious tattooist who says she wants to help. The tattooist demonstrates her experience of both men and magic when Marya is again threatened by the arrival of Daniel: she removes the black soot that has transformed him, and changes him into the animal his soul most suits - a slow-witted but loyal puppy, that Marya happily adopts. Molly tells her companions about Sir Timothy Hunter, unaware that Tim has transformed himself into a cat and is listening in. The tattooist is aware, however: she traps Tim in his cat body long enough to take him to her home and thoroughly examine his soul, intending to do the same to him that she did with Daniel.

She has to change her plan when she is shocked to discover that Tim has no &quot;inner animal&quot; and that he is just a normal, healthy teenage boy. Instead, she offers to give him a tattoo that will stop him from ever hurting Molly: Tim agrees, and gains a moth/scorpion hybrid across his chest that stings him whenever he gets angry or performs magic. Soon after, Gwen decides it is time to move on when Tim&#x27;s father begins a tentative relationship with Holly, the woman from the taxi. Almost immediately, Holly&#x27;s son Cyril becomes a target of a demon&#x27;s malign interest, and rescuing him helps Tim to decide that his presence is putting those he loves at risk. He runs away.

====On the road====
Molly, meanwhile, has been sent to visit her grandmother, a formidable old woman with a touch of second sight. Whilst up on Leanen Hill at her grandmother&#x27;s suggestion, Molly learns that Tim has run away and resolves to find him again. She attempts to attract a fairy in the hope that they will grant her wish, but when she succeeds in drawing the Amadan to her, she accidentally challenges him to a contest to see who is the greatest fool. With the contest due to take place in Faerie, Molly is transported from the real world and left to fend for herself until it can be arranged. Knowing something of the Fair Folk from her grandmother, Molly knows that if she eats Faerie food she will never be able to return home: touching the ground would wither her and eating real food would starve her, so she would be forced to stay in Faerie. Instead, she attempts to grow her own real food, her efforts attracting the attention of the Faeries, and her stubbornness attracting the ire of Titania: the Queen tricks Molly into eating Faerie food by making her crops grow overnight. The trick backfires, though, as Molly&#x27;s anger transforms her into &quot;the burning girl&quot;, who cuts a swathe of destruction across Faerie with a horse named Prince.

Tim, meanwhile, is living rough on the streets when he is taken in by a homeless magician who knew his father. The magician provides the proper environment for Tim to let his tattoo come alive and leave him: it separates into its scorpion and moth parts and fights, with the moth destroying the scorpion. Tim is about to accept the moth back onto his heart when the magician distracts him, but the tattoo still manages to return to his arm. Following his experience, Tim decides that what he needs is a mentor to teach him about magic and sets off for America to find Zatanna.

At Los Angeles airport, he meets the succubus Leah who has moved to the city to become a model. She convinces Tim to travel with her, and accompanies him out into the desert on a camping trip. In the night, Leah disguises herself as Molly and tries to sleep with Tim: he sees through the deception but tells her that if she had come to him as herself, he wasn&#x27;t sure what he would have done. Tim kisses Leah, and the two continue where they left off. In the morning, the two become trapped in the world of a dying mermaid and Leah has to take the mermaid&#x27;s place to save Tim. Tim wakes in the real world and continues on his journey, without realizing what has happened to Leah.

Tim continues his travels across America, until he somehow ends up trapped on an island on the outskirts of Faerie. He manages to escape the island with the help of Huon the Small, the first King of Faerie. Huon and Tim travel into the heart of Faerie.

Molly and Prince have been joined by Titania&#x27;s otherwise loyal flitling Yarrow, and have decimated the kingdom. Worse, Molly manages to unenchant Prince to reveal that he is in fact Titania&#x27;s son and the heir to the throne: Prince has spent most of his life in Hell, given to the lords there in payment of a tithe originally agreed by Huon. In truth, Faerie is not a kingdom of its own, but part of Hell that Lucifer offered to the Fair Folk when they first left the Mundane World. Lucifer&#x27;s will and belief created the realm. In revealing Prince&#x27;s true nature - which Titania had attempted to hide to stop the Lords of Hell discovering that he had escaped home - Molly brings the armies of Hell to Faerie, demanding reparation or battle.
In the midst of all this, the fair folk have lost their own will, belief and reason for being in the Fairie. Without such belief, the realm and all who are in it start becoming undone by something known as &quot;the Leveler&quot;. Battle is temporarily averted when the Lords of Hell learn of the Leveller&#x27;s presence and seek to escape. The flitling Yarrow saves Fairie: her belief and loyalty cause it to be recreated in reality as exactly what it seemed to be - happy, natural and carefree - and with no tithe now owed to Hell. There is much celebration and as Tim and Molly are reunited, Titania tempers her curse as best she can: Molly&#x27;s feet will no longer touch the ground and she will always have Faerie food to eat, so she can return to the mundane world with Tim.

Returning to Tim doesn&#x27;t make Molly as happy as she hoped: instead of returning to London, Tim takes them to join Zatanna on tour and learn magic from her. His obsession with magic causes Tim to ignore everything else, including Molly&#x27;s growing sadness and even the fact that her feet don&#x27;t touch the floor. Zatanna tries to teach Tim to open his eyes, but in the end has no choice but to help Molly. As Molly learns of Tim&#x27;s night with Leah - sad that he didn&#x27;t think enough of her to tell her the truth - she breaks up with him, using a charm given to her by Zatanna to return home to her family. Tim reacts badly to Molly leaving, creating a whole world that he could mope in while toying with its natives&#x27; lives, until the demon Khara finds him. At first, she berates him for his inability to connect to the real world - until she spots his moth tattoo and realizes that it is preventing him from being able to connect so that he never has anyone close to him to get hurt. She encourages him to &quot;open&quot; himself and let the world in, which removes the tattoo and eventually leads Tim to decide that his magic belongs to the world and not him. He releases it into the universe and resolves that he will have nothing more to do with it.

====Angels and visitations====
Although Tim thinks he is finished with magic, magic is not finished with him. Returning home with the fallen angel Araquel — who had previously been tricked in to breaking his chains by Barbatos — Tim finds that the armies of Heaven and Hell are fighting each other to a standstill in the mortal world. The prize they are fighting for is the magic that Tim released into the world, which would give them the power to recreate the world to their own design.
Tim&#x27;s family find themselves caught in the crossfire of the battle when his father&#x27;s wedding to Holly is interrupted by the groom transforming into a ravenous beast with a taste for angel-flesh. It transpires that Mister Vasuki, the surgeon who miraculously restored Mr Hunter to health after the fire, is in truth a demon hoping to force Tim to work for him. In retaliation, two angels elevate Tim&#x27;s soon-to-be stepbrother Cyril to sainthood, and provide him with a foursome of living action-figures with dangerous powers. Araquel becomes their victim, turned into chocolate and smashed to pieces on the ground. Tim uses Awn the Blink and Reverend Slaggingham to trap all the angels and demons. In his anger, Tim throws an ice-cream at the leader of the angelic forces, only for her to merge with the leader of the demonic forces and reveal herself as Shivering Jemmy of the Shallow Brigade. She calls an end to the conflict having achieved her objective: to have &quot;thrown in the face&quot; ice cream.

Tim&#x27;s new family try to settle back to normality, with Cyril and Tim&#x27;s father returned to normal and his new stepmother blaming everybody&#x27;s amnesia on too much wine at the reception. Tim is just enjoying his new freedom from magic when he finds the box that Leah used to live in: picking it up, he finds himself sucked inside it and trapped inside a small square of ground in a vast forest. He spends a lifetime there, talking to a tree that grew from a seed that fell inside his patch of ground. When a fire starts to destroy the forest, Tim&#x27;s anger puts him back in touch with his magic as he tries desperately to save his one tree, but then finds himself returned outside the box, not a second older than the moment he was first trapped inside it.

Waiting for him is Leah, who trapped him in the box in the hope of teaching him an important lesson about his magic. But the lesson hasn&#x27;t been learned in the way that she hoped, because of Tim&#x27;s focus on the small scale: it wasn&#x27;t the destruction of the forest that prompted him to reconnect with his magic, but the threat to the single tree. Exasperatingly, Leah cannot even decide if Tim is wholly wrong in thinking that way. Instead, she leaves Tim with the important reminder that he might try to throw away his magic, but he will never wholly succeed: it is a part of him, and always will be.

===Peter Gross===
Peter Gross explained in his 25 issue run on the book as being the story of Tim&#x27;s &quot;boy time&quot;, commenting that previously the book had often presented benevolent female characters but had been less successful at their benevolent male counterparts. His story was partly designed, then, to show Tim accepting his male side and learning how to be a boy - one of Gross&#x27; reasons for not using the character of Molly during his run. He did comment that if he had stayed on the book, Gross&#x27; next story would have shown Tim similarly exploring his feminine side and would therefore have reintroduced some of the established female characters such as Molly or Gwen.

He announced his run as going &quot;in another direction&quot; and not trying &quot;to duplicate John&#x27;s success&quot;. Consequently, his first issue laid down the background to his run, introducing Tim&#x27;s &quot;Other&quot; (an alternate version of Tim created subconsciously when Tim was a child) and establishing that this Other was hunting through all the worlds Tim had unconsciously created during his life, trying to find the original and steal the original&#x27;s power. Gross also showed a conscious break from exploring issues of Tim&#x27;s parentage, having Titania announce that she would &quot;never aid [Tim] again&quot; after he refused to accept a precious - and potentially life-saving - gift from her. Molly, too, was to be less important to Gross&#x27; run — Tim is first warned to stay away from her by her protective brothers and then Molly herself decides to have nothing more to do with him after meeting his Other and mistaking him for Tim, thinking that he has broken his promise to never speak to demons and is well on the way to becoming Sir Timothy. Gross responded to &quot;nearly everyone&quot; asking if Molly was going to return by explaining that when he was asked to take over, John Ney Rieber had specifically asked for her not to stay in the comic and although this request was later withdrawn Gross thought it fitted the story he had plotted and made Tim more central to his own comic if she wasn&#x27;t used. .. There was a spin-off ongoing series planned for her but was abandoned with the death of Vertigo Editor Lou Stathis. Molly would return in the series &quot;Books of Magic&quot; during war times.

Gross&#x27; first story arc, then, dealt with Tim settling into Bardsley school and meeting Thomas Currie, a man who had traveled through various worlds searching for the true Tim to either prepare him to defeat his Other or kill him to prevent the Other stealing his power. Currie took advantage of the disappearance of a teacher at Bardsley so that he could take his place and interact with Tim, but this only caused problems for both as Tim&#x27;s stepbrother Cyril saw the teacher die whilst potholing under the school and used the status he gained from controlling the other boys&#x27; access to the body to turn the school against the new teacher and Tim, although his influence only lasted until Tim and Currie removed the body and the teacher resigned. Tim makes a deal with Cyril to stay away from Bardsley in exchange for his stepbrother not telling Bill and Holly what Tim is really doing - getting private lessons in magic from Mr Currie to help him face his Other. However, Tim is unaware that his Other has already arrived in the true world, causing a traffic accident that injures his father and Cyril and kills his stepmother, Holly.

This causes Currie to go onto a war footing: he kills Tim&#x27;s father whilst he recovers in hospital to give Tim the emotional trauma he needs to subconsciously create another alternate world, and then manipulates the outburst of magic so that instead of a new world, Currie&#x27;s version of Tim is recreated. The teacher then drains Tim&#x27;s magic and hides it in a prearranged place: the true Tim leaves the world to learn how to control his magic and defeat his Other, whilst Currie and his alternate Tim remain to die in battle with the hope of convincing the Other that he has killed the true Tim. When the Other was convinced that he was triumphant, he used his power to open all the gateways between the worlds — allowing Tim to escape to the Inn Between the Worlds using his mother&#x27;s glamor stone to disguise himself as a girl called Mary but also freeing the Wild Hunt, the god-killing band trapped for two-thousand years by a compact of rulers from Heaven, Faerie, Hell and other realms.
Living as Mary and working at the Inn, Tim becomes best friends with a girl called Joh - a relationship complicated when she sees him as Tim and falls in love with him, forcing Tim to admit the truth. The two are forced to flee, when the Wild Hunt are manipulated by a disguised Auberon into hunting Tim and destroying the Inn, a fate which Tim avoids only by challenging and defeating the leader of the Hunt. He then returns to Earth to reclaim his magic and defeat the Other to reverse the damage done in opening all the gates between the worlds.

In order to defeat the Other, Tim needs the help of the demon Barbatos - help which he can only obtain by selling a memory to the demon and sealing his fate as Sir Timothy Hunter. Tim faces up to his responsibilities, and sacrifices his future: Barbatos takes the memory of Tim&#x27;s creation of his Other, making it impossible for the Other to exist separately from Tim and the many separate pieces of Tim are reunited for the first time in his life. Tim&#x27;s soul is immediately forfeit to Barbatos, and he becomes his slave but sets in place the chain of events that eventually leads to the demon being defeated and trapped in the Dreaming. The final issue showed Barbatos released forty years later and allowed to return to hell. Once free, the demon discovered the true nature of Tim&#x27;s apparent defeat: the boy had hidden his soul inside the memory Barbatos took and once inside the demon it slept, slowly taking complete control of Barbatos&#x27; body until Tim owned it completely, remodeling it with his magic to resemble his own at the age of fourteen. The final image of the issue, and &quot;The Books of Magic&quot;, showed Tim whole and complete, finally grown-up and ready to face whatever challenges the future held with &quot;no more whining&quot;.

===Annuals===
In addition to the mini-series and the ongoing series, Vertigo also produced four &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; annuals. The first, &quot;Arcana: The Books of Magic Annual&quot;, reintroduced Tim Hunter and launched the ongoing series. The second, actually titled &quot;The Books of Magic Annual&quot; #1 due to the change in name from &quot;Arcana&quot;, told the story of Tim&#x27;s encounter with a minor god&#x27;s daughter who was one of Tamlin&#x27;s cast-off conquests. Both these annuals were later included in the collected editions of &quot;The Books of Faerie&quot; and &quot;The Books of Faerie: Auberon&#x27;s Tale&quot; respectively.

The third Annual is set during Tim&#x27;s time in America, and sees him saving a child abuse victim from similar abuse at the hands of the Minotaur, transported to modern day America to hide in a nightclub called The Labyrinth. The final annual was the only one not to be written in its entirety by John Ney Reiber, coming part way into Peter Gross&#x27; run on the ongoing series. Gross used the annual to give some background to Tim&#x27;s Other, showing his realization of the existence of other worlds and development into the ruthless character seen in the monthly series. The bulk of the annual was written by Gross, with contributions from John Ney Reiber and Mark Waid. Neither of these annuals have been republished in collected editions.

===&quot;Vertigo Rave&quot;===
An exclusive &quot;Books of Magic&quot; story, titled &quot;The Lot&quot; and written by Ney Rieber, appeared in &quot;Vertigo Rave&quot; #1, published in the fall of 1994.

===&quot;The Books of Faerie&quot;===
There were also three spin-off mini-series set in the Faerie realm, entitled &quot;The Books of Faerie&quot;. The first two volumes dealt with the rise to power of Titania and Auberon respectively, whilst the third documents the misadventures of Molly O&#x27;Reilly as she tried to come to terms with the curse placed upon her by Titania during the &quot;Girl in the Box&quot; storyline. There were also plans to create an ongoing &quot;The Books of Faerie&quot; series starring Molly O&#x27;Reilly, but these were eventually abandoned.

===&quot;Hellblazer&quot;/&quot;The Books of Magic&quot;===
In December 1997, a two-issue crossover with &quot;Hellblazer&quot; was published, with a script from the then current &quot;Hellblazer&quot; writer Paul Jenkins from a story written in collaboration with John Ney Rieber. The artwork was by artist Paul Lee.

The two issues showed Tim Hunter coming into possession of a time capsule that had been made by John Constantine as a child. The capsule contained all of Constantine&#x27;s childhood innocence, placed there in one of his first acts of magic to rid himself of the perceived weakness. Tim attempts to return the box to its original owner, but Constantine wants nothing to do with it, until it falls into the hands of a demon called Kobal (&quot;Master of the Infernal Theatre&quot;).

Tim and Constantine end up journeying to Hell — specifically Constantine&#x27;s own Hell, described as much more dangerous than the fluffy monster Hell that Tim visited in the &quot;Reckonings&quot; storyline — where the younger magician manages to trick the demon into returning the box.

===&quot;Winter&#x27;s Edge&quot;===
Vertigo published a number of winter specials under the title &quot;Winter&#x27;s Edge&quot;, featuring short stories based on their current properties and featuring stories to preview upcoming series and one-shots. &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; featured in all three issues of &quot;Winter&#x27;s Edge&quot;, with issue #1 containing &quot;Thanks for Nothing&quot; by John Ney Rieber and issues #2 and #3 featuring stories written Peter Gross. Issue #2 featured a story called &quot;We Three Things&quot;, and issue #3 featured the Dead Boy Detectives in a tale set during Tim&#x27;s time at one of the Inns Between the Worlds.

===&quot;A Day, a Night and a Dream&quot;===
As well as an abandoned &quot;The Books of Faerie&quot; ongoing series, Vertigo planned a prestige-format one shot called &quot;The Books of Magic: A Day, a Night and a Dream&quot;. The comic was to be written by Peter Gross and illustrated by Charles Vess, set during Tim&#x27;s stay at one of the Inns Between the Worlds. The issue was intended to be an introduction to the ongoing series and the wider world of Vertigo, but was eventually incorporated into the main comic&#x27;s storyline instead.

===&quot;The Names of Magic&quot;===
The depiction of Tim Hunter&#x27;s life continued in a five-issue mini-series called &quot;The Names of Magic&quot;, in which Tim learnt his true name (Timothy Hunter; Tamar, son of Tamlin; the Opener; the Merlin; Magic) and was accepted into the school of magic, known simply as White School, which exists across the Multiverse of Worlds in DC.

===&quot;Hunter: The Age of Magic&quot;===
Another ongoing series called &quot;Hunter: The Age of Magic&quot; (25 issues) followed shortly after the end of this series. It ran from September 2001 to September 2003, and told of his graduation and what happened to him afterwards.

===&quot;Books of Magick: Life During Wartime&quot;===
Another series, &quot;Books of Magick: Life During Wartime&quot; began in July 2004 and lasted fifteen issues. This series depicts two Earths, both of which have a strong connection to an alternate version of Tim Hunter. On one of these worlds a war is going on between humans (known as the Bred) and the races of the Faerie (known as the Born). The world is ruled by the Born, but there is a resistance made up of both Born and Bred that features versions of Zatanna and John Constantine among others. The second world is one made by Tim Hunter as a place of safety where he can hide from his enemies.

==Collected editions==
===Paperback===
The series have been collected into a number of trade paperbacks.
Issues #51-75 of the ongoing &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; series remain uncollected in trade paperbacks.

Issues #1-5 of the &quot;Books of Magick: Life During Wartime&quot; series (with Dean Ormston) have been collected into a trade paperback (March 2005, ).

===Hardcover===
==Adaptations==
===Novels===
In 2003, HarperCollins began publishing a series of &quot;Books of Magic&quot; young adult novels under the Eos imprint, adapted from the comics series, by Carla Jablonski. Each novel featured cover art by Christopher Moeller:

* &quot;The Books of Magic 1: The Invitation&quot;, May 2003, 
* &quot;The Books of Magic 2: Bindings&quot;, May 2003, 
* &quot;The Books of Magic 3: The Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot;, August 2003, 
* &quot;The Books of Magic 4: Consequences&quot;, January 2004, 
* &quot;The Books of Magic 5: Lost Places&quot;, May 2004, 
* &quot;The Books of Magic 6: Reckonings&quot;, October 2004, 

The first book is based on the original miniseries. The subsequent books are based on story arcs in the second series; except &quot;The Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot;, which is based on the Vertigo crossover event of the same name.

===Films===
A film version of &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; has been in development hell for many years. It was originally optioned &quot;by Warner Bros. some years before the first &quot;Harry Potter&quot; book was published&quot; (a series which has been frequently compared to this series (see &quot;Harry Potter&quot; influences and analogues)), with Neil Gaiman signing on as executive producer in 1998. After several years of drafting and redrafting, the script moved so far from the original concept that Gaiman and Paul Levitz advised the filmmakers that any audience seeing it expecting a film based on the comic would be disappointed, and decided to develop the movie themselves. They worked with screenwriter Matt Greenberg, who had written early drafts of the original script, to come up with some closer to the original story. As yet, no adaption has been filmed or scheduled for release.

==References in other media==
A section of Paul Cornell&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off novel &quot;Happy Endings&quot; features Death in a brief cameo, quoting her dialogue from the original &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; mini-series. The section was written by author Neil Penswick, as part of a chapter written in tandem by the authors of the previous 49 novels.

The faerie market in Gaiman&#x27;s novel &quot;Stardust&quot; has many similarities to the one presented in the original miniseries. This may not be surprising as it&#x27;s simply a case of Gaiman borrowing a portion of one work to use in the other.

The faerie market also makes references to amongst other things &quot;My Neighbour Totoro&quot;, &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot;, Rupert Bear, and a possible future Sir Timothy Hunter, which can be seen directly to the right of Tim Hunter when he first arrives at the market.

In 2012, Timothy Hunter and the Books of Magic make a return in The New 52 series &quot;Justice League Dark&quot; where a reluctant Tim, having given up his magic, is reunited with John Constantine and Madame Xanadu to stop an old nemesis of Constantine&#x27;s from getting his hands on the books.

==Reception==
Maryanne Booth reviewed &quot;The Books of Magic: Summonings&quot; for &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine, rating it a 9 out of 10 overall. Booth comments that &quot;although this is the third installment of the series, it&#x27;s thankfully not essential to have already read the rest of the collection. Fortunately for those without masses of time on their hands, this graphic novel stands alone as a more than enjoyable read and comes highly recommended&quot;.

<doc id="265030" wikidata="Q217160" url="?curid=265030" title="Kenny Rogers">
<text>Kenneth Ray Rogers (August 21, 1938 – March 20, 2020) was an American singer and songwriter. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2013. Rogers was particularly popular with country audiences but also charted more than 120 hit singles across various genres, topping the country and pop album charts for more than 200 individual weeks in the United States alone. He sold more than 100 million records worldwide during his lifetime, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. His fame and career spanned multiple genres: jazz, folk, pop, rock, and country. He remade his career and was one of the most successful cross-over artists of all time.

In the late 1950s, Rogers began his recording career with the Houston-based group the Scholars, who first released &quot;The Poor Little Doggie&quot;. After some solo releases, including 1958&#x27;s &quot;That Crazy Feeling&quot;, Rogers then joined a group with the jazz singer Bobby Doyle. In 1966, he became a member of the folk ensemble the New Christy Minstrels, playing double bass and bass guitar as well as singing. In 1967, he and several members of the New Christy Minstrels left to found the group the First Edition, with whom he scored his first major hit, &quot;Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)&quot;, a psychedelic rock song which peaked at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. As Rogers took an increased leadership role in the First Edition following the success of 1969&#x27;s &quot;Ruby, Don&#x27;t Take Your Love to Town&quot;, the band gradually changed styles to a more country feel. The band broke up in 1975–76, and Rogers embarked on a long and successful solo career, which included several successful collaborations, including duets with singers Dottie West, Dolly Parton, and Sheena Easton, and a songwriting partnership with Lionel Richie. His signature song, 1978&#x27;s &quot;The Gambler&quot;, was a crossover hit that won him a Grammy Award in 1980 and was selected in 2018 for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress. He developed the Gambler persona into a character for a successful series of television films starting with 1980&#x27;s Emmy-nominated &quot;Kenny Rogers as The Gambler&quot;.

Rogers&#x27;s albums &quot;The Gambler&quot; and &quot;Kenny&quot; were featured in the About.com poll of &quot;The 200 Most Influential Country Albums Ever&quot;. He was voted the &quot;Favorite Singer of All Time&quot; in a 1986 poll by readers of both &quot;USA Today&quot; and &quot;People&quot;. He received numerous awards, such as the AMAs, Grammys, ACMs, and CMAs, as well as a lifetime achievement award for a career spanning six decades in 2003. Later success included the 2006 album release &quot;Water &amp; Bridges&quot;, an across-the-board hit that entered the top five in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Albums sales charts, also charting in the top 15 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The first single from the album, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Unlove You&quot;, was also a sizable chart hit. Remaining a popular entertainer around the world, he continued to tour regularly until his retirement in 2017.

Rogers had acting roles in movies and television shows, including the title roles in &quot;Kenny Rogers as The Gambler&quot;, the MacShayne series for &quot;The NBC Mystery Movie&quot;, and the 1982 feature film &quot;Six Pack&quot;. He was a co-founder of the restaurant chain Kenny Rogers Roasters in collaboration with former KFC CEO John Y. Brown Jr. Although the stores closed in the United States, they are still a fixture in Asia.

==Early life==
Kenneth Ray Rogers was born the fourth of eight children on August 21, 1938, at St Joseph&#x27;s Infirmary in Houston, Texas. His parents were Lucille Lois Rogers, a nurse&#x27;s assistant, and Edward Floyd Rogers, a carpenter. Rogers was said to be of Irish and Native American ancestry. Rogers attended Wharton Elementary School, George Washington Junior High School, and graduated from Jefferson Davis High School (now Northside High School) in 1956.

In 1949, Rogers won a talent show at the Texan Theatre. He served as a busboy at the Rice Hotel and swept floors at a hat store for $9 a week. He later attended the University of Houston.

In 1986, on &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot;, Rogers told the audience that he was the first person in his family &quot;as far back as we know&quot; to graduate from high school. We were broke. We lived in a federal housing project. I think the most money my father ever made was $75 a week. There were times as a child that, I don&#x27;t think I was ever really hungry – I always had food to eat – but there&#x27;s no question that our family were nutritionally-deprived at times. We&#x27;d eat peanut butter sandwiches, cause that&#x27;s all there was. Quite honestly, when you&#x27;re a kid, you don&#x27;t know any better, you think that&#x27;s how everyone eats.

==Career==
=== Early career ===
In a recording career dating back to the 1950s, Rogers moved from teenage rock and roll through psychedelic rock to become a country-pop crossover artist of the 1970s and 1980s. He had a minor solo hit in 1957 called &quot;That Crazy Feeling&quot;. After sales slowed down, Rogers joined a jazz group called the Bobby Doyle Three, who were frequently hired by clubs due to their fan following. The group recorded for Columbia Records. They disbanded in 1965, and a 1966 jazzy rock single Rogers recorded for Mercury Records, called &quot;Here&#x27;s That Rainy Day&quot;, failed. Rogers also worked as a producer, writer and session musician for other performers, including country artists Mickey Gilley and Eddy Arnold. In 1966, he joined the New Christy Minstrels as a singer and double bass player.

Feeling that the Minstrels were not offering the success they wanted, Rogers and fellow members Mike Settle, Terry Williams, and Thelma Camacho left the group. They formed the First Edition in 1967 (later renamed &quot;Kenny Rogers and the First Edition&quot;). They were later joined by Kin Vassy. They chalked up a string of hits on both the pop and country charts, including &quot;Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)&quot; (Rogers doing lead vocals and bass—and famously used in the dream sequence of the Coen brothers&#x27; &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;), &quot;But You Know I Love You&quot;, &quot;Ruby, Don&#x27;t Take Your Love to Town&quot;, &quot;Tell It All, Brother&quot;, &quot;Reuben James&quot;, and &quot;Something&#x27;s Burning&quot;.

When the First Edition disbanded in 1976, Rogers launched his solo career. He soon developed a more middle-of-the-road sound that sold to both pop and country audiences. He charted more than 60 top 40 hit singles (including two number ones—&quot;Lady&quot; and &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot;). His music has been featured in top-selling movie soundtracks, such as &quot;Convoy&quot;, &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;, and &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;.

===Solo career and duets with other artists===
The First Edition broke up in 1975, which was a rough time for the recently divorced Rogers. That year, he was the face of a national commercial advertising the &quot;Quick Pickin&#x27; Fun Strummin&#x27; Home Guitar Course.&quot; But in 1976, Rogers signed a solo deal with United Artists. Producer Larry Butler and Rogers began a partnership that would last four years.

Rogers&#x27;s first outing for his new label was &quot;Love Lifted Me&quot;. The album charted and two singles, &quot;Love Lifted Me&quot; and &quot;While the Feeling&#x27;s Good&quot;, were minor hits. The song &quot;Runaway Girl&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Trackdown&quot; (1976). Later in 1976, Rogers issued his second album, the self-titled &quot;Kenny Rogers&quot;, whose first single, &quot;Laura (What&#x27;s He Got That I Ain&#x27;t Got)&quot;, was another solo hit.

The single &quot;Lucille&quot; (1977) was a major hit, reaching number one on the pop charts in 12 countries, selling over five million copies, and firmly establishing Rogers&#x27;s post-First Edition career. On the strength of &quot;Lucille&quot;, the album &quot;Kenny Rogers&quot; reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Album Chart. More success was to follow, including the multi-platinum selling album &quot;The Gambler&quot; and another international Number 1 single, &quot;Coward of the County&quot;, taken from the equally successful album, &quot;Kenny&quot;. In 1980, the Rogers/Butler partnership came to an end, though they would occasionally reunite: in 1987 on the album &quot;I Prefer the Moonlight&quot; and again in 1993 on the album &quot;If Only My Heart Had a Voice&quot;.

In the late 1970s, Rogers teamed up with close friend and Country Music legend Dottie West for a series of albums and duets. Together the duo won two gold records (one of which later went platinum), two CMA Awards, an ACM nomination, two Grammy nominations and 1 Music City News Award for their two hit albums &quot;Every Time Two Fools Collide&quot; (No. 1) and &quot;Classics&quot; (No. 3), selling out stadiums and arenas while on tour for several years, as well as appearing on several network television specials which showcased them. Their hits together &quot;Every Time Two Fools Collide&quot; (No. 1), &quot;Anyone Who Isn&#x27;t Me Tonight&quot; (No. 2), &quot;What Are We Doin&#x27; in Love&quot; (No. 1), &quot;All I Ever Need Is You&quot; (No. 1) and &quot;Till I Can Make It On My Own&quot; (No. 3) all became Country standards. Of West, Rogers stated in a 1995 TNN interview: &quot;She, more than anybody else I ever worked with, sang with such emotion that you actually believed what she sang. A lot of people sing words, Dottie West sang emotions.&quot; In a 1978 press release for their album &quot;Every Time Two Fools Collide&quot;, Rogers credited West with further establishing and cementing his career with Country Music audiences. In the same release, West credited him with taking her career to new audiences. Rogers was with West only hours before she died at age 58 after sustaining injuries in a 1991 car accident, as discussed in his 2012 biography &quot;Luck Or Something Like It&quot;. In 1995 he starred as himself, alongside Michele Lee as West, in the CBS biographical film &quot;Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story&quot;.

In 1980, a selection he recorded as a duet with Kim Carnes, &quot;Don&#x27;t Fall in Love with a Dreamer&quot;, became a hit. Earlier that year, he sang a duet of &quot;You and Me&quot; with Lynda Carter in her television music special &quot;Lynda Carter Special&quot; (Rogers originally recorded this with Dottie West for the Every Time Two Fools Collide album). Later in 1980 came his partnership with Lionel Richie, who wrote and produced Rogers&#x27;s No. 1 hit &quot;Lady&quot;. Richie went on to produce Rogers&#x27;s 1981 album &quot;Share Your Love,&quot; a chart topper and commercial favorite featuring hits such as &quot;I Don&#x27;t Need You&quot; (Pop No. 3), &quot;Through the Years&quot; (Pop No. 13), and &quot;Share Your Love with Me&quot; (Pop No. 14). His first Christmas album was also released that same year. Rogers would return the favor by singing backing vocals on Richie&#x27;s top 5 hit &quot;My Love&quot;. In 1982, Rogers released the album &quot;Love Will Turn You Around.&quot; The album&#x27;s the title track reached No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and topped the country and AC charts. It was the theme song of Rogers&#x27;s 1982 film &quot;Six Pack&quot;. Shortly afterwards, he started working with producer David Foster in 1983, recording the smash Top 10 hit Bob Seger cover &quot;We&#x27;ve Got Tonight&quot;, a duet with Sheena Easton. Also a number 1 single on the Country charts in the United States, it reached the Top 30 on the British charts.

In 1981, Rogers bought the old ABC Dunhill building and built one of the most popular and state-of-the-art recording studios in Los Angeles, which he named Lion Share Studios. The song &quot;We Are the World&quot; was recorded there and at A&amp;M Studios.

Rogers went on to work with Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees who produced his 1983 hit album &quot;Eyes That See in the Dark&quot;, featuring the title track and yet another No. 1 hit &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot;, a duet with Dolly Parton. Gibb, along with his brothers, Robin and Maurice, originally wrote the song for Diana Ross in an R&amp;B style, only later to change it for Rogers&#x27;s album.

&quot;Islands in the Stream&quot;, Rogers&#x27;s duet with Dolly Parton, was the first single to be released from &quot;Eyes That See in the Dark&quot; in the United States, and it quickly went to No. 1 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (it would prove to be the last country single to reach No. 1 on that chart until &quot;Amazed&quot; by Lonestar did so in 2000), as well as topping &quot;Billboard&quot;″s country and adult contemporary singles charts; it was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipping two million copies in the United States. Rogers would reunite with Parton in 1984 for a holiday album, &quot;Once Upon a Christmas&quot;, and the TV special &quot;Kenny &amp; Dolly: A Christmas to Remember&quot; (which resulted in a popular video of &quot;Christmas Without You&quot;), as well as a 1985 duet &quot;Real Love&quot;, which also topped the U.S. country singles chart. The two would continue to collaborate on occasional projects through subsequent years, including a 2013 duet single &quot;You Can&#x27;t Make Old Friends&quot;.

Despite the success of &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot;, however, RCA Records insisted on releasing &quot;Eyes&quot;″ title track as the first UK single, and the song stalled at a disappointing No. 61 there, although it did stay in the top 100 for several weeks. (When it was eventually released in the United States, it was more successful, charting high on the Adult Contemporary chart and making the country top 30.) &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot; was issued as a follow-up single in Britain and sold well, making No. 7. The album itself reached No. 1 on the country charts on both sides of the Atlantic and enjoyed multi-million sales. &quot;Buried Treasure&quot;, &quot;This Woman&quot; and &quot;Evening Star&quot;/&quot;Midsummer Nights&quot; were also all successful singles from the album.

Shortly after came the album &quot;What About Me?&quot;, a hit whose title track—a trio performance with James Ingram and Kim Carnes—was nominated for a Grammy Award; the single &quot;Crazy&quot; (not to be confused with the Willie Nelson-penned Patsy Cline hit), co-written with Richard Marx, topped the country charts. David Foster was to work again with Rogers in his 1985 album &quot;The Heart of the Matter,&quot; although this time Foster was playing backing music rather than producing, a role given to George Martin. This album was another success, going to No. 1, with the title track making to the top ten category in the singles charts.

The next few years saw Rogers scoring several top country hits on a regular basis, including &quot;Twenty Years Ago&quot;, &quot;Morning Desire&quot;, &quot;Tomb of the Unknown Love&quot;, among others. On January 28, 1985, Rogers was one of the 45 artists who recorded the worldwide charity song &quot;We Are the World&quot; to support hunger victims in Africa. The following year he played at Giants Stadium.

In 1988, Rogers won a Grammy Award for &quot;Best Country Collaboration with Vocals&quot; with Ronnie Milsap—&quot;Make No Mistake, She&#x27;s Mine&quot;. In the 1990s, Rogers continued to chart with singles such as &quot;The Factory&quot; and &quot;Crazy In Love&quot;, another selection that Kim Carnes provided him with, &quot;If You Want To Find Love&quot;, and &quot;The Greatest&quot;. His second Christmas album, titled &quot;Christmas in America,&quot; was released in 1989 for Reprise Records. From 1991 to 1994, Rogers hosted &quot;The Real West&quot; on A&amp;E, and on The History Channel since 1995 (Reruns only on The History Channel). He visited Miller&#x27;s during this time period. From 1992 to 1995, Rogers co-owned and headlined Branson, Missouri&#x27;s 4,000 seat Grand Palace Theatre. In 1994, Rogers released his &quot;dream&quot; album titled &quot;Timepiece&quot; on Atlantic Records. It consisted of 1930s/1940s jazz standards, the type of music he had performed in his early days with the Bobby Doyle Three in Houston.

In 1996, Rogers released an album &quot;Vote For Love&quot; where the public requested their favorite love songs and Rogers performed the songs. (Several of his own hits were in the final version.) The album was the first for the TV shopping channel QVC&#x27;s record label, onQ Music. The album, sold exclusively by QVC, was a huge success and was later issued in stores under a variety of different titles. It reached No. 1 in the UK country charts under the title &quot;Love Songs&quot; (a title also used for various compilations) and also crossed over into the mainstream charts.

In 1999, Rogers scored with the single &quot;The Greatest&quot;, a song about life from a child&#x27;s point of view (looked at through a baseball game) The song reached the top 40 of &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Country singles chart and was a Country Music Television Number One video. It was on Rogers&#x27;s album &quot;She Rides Wild Horses&quot; the following year (itself a top 10 success). Also in 1999, Rogers produced a song, &quot;We&#x27;ve Got It All&quot;, specifically for the series finale of the ABC show &quot;Home Improvement.&quot;

===2000–2015===

In the 21st century (and at age 61), Rogers was back at No. 1 for the first time in more than a decade with the 2000 single &quot;Buy Me a Rose&quot;. In doing so, he broke a 26-year-old record held by Hank Snow (who, in April 1974, was aged 59 when he scored with &quot;Hello Love&quot;). Rogers held the record until 2003, when then 70-year-old Willie Nelson became the oldest artist to have a No. 1 on the country charts with his duet with Toby Keith, &quot;Beer for My Horses&quot;.

Although Rogers did not record new albums for a couple of years, he continued to have success in many countries with more greatest hits packages. In 2004 &quot;42 Ultimate Hits&quot;, which was the first hits collection to span his days with the First Edition to the present, reached Number 6 on the American country charts and went gold. It also featured two new songs, &quot;My World Is Over&quot; with Whitney Duncan and &quot;We Are the Same&quot;. &quot;My World Is Over&quot; was released as a single and was a minor hit. In 2005, &quot;The Very Best of Kenny Rogers&quot;, a double album, sold well in Europe. It was the first new solo Rogers hits album to reach the United Kingdom for over a decade, despite many compilations there that were not true hits packages.

Rogers also signed with Capitol Records and had more success with the TV advertised release &quot;21 Number Ones&quot; in January 2006. Although this CD did contain 21 chart-toppers as the title claims (recorded between 1976 and the present day), this was not a complete collection of Rogers&#x27;s No. 1 singles, omitting such singles as &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; and &quot;What About Me?&quot;

Capitol followed &quot;21 Number Ones&quot; with Rogers&#x27;s new studio album, &quot;Water &amp; Bridges&quot;, in March 2006 on the Capitol Nashville Records label. The first single from the album was &quot;I Can&#x27;t Unlove You&quot;, which peaked at No. 17 on the country charts, after spending over 6 months on the hit list, more than 50 years after he formed his first group and 38 years after his first major hit as leader of the First Edition; the song remains in recurrent airplay on some radio stations today. &quot;I Can&#x27;t Unlove You&quot; was followed up with the second single from the album, &quot;The Last Ten Years (Superman)&quot;, in September 2006. The third single, &quot;Calling Me&quot;, which features Don Henley, became popular in early 2007, and was nominated for a Grammy Award at the 2007 Grammy Awards. Also in 2007, the 1977 &quot;Kenny Rogers&quot; album was re-issued as a double CD, also featuring the 1979 &quot;Kenny&quot; album and this once again put Rogers&#x27;s name into the sales charts worldwide. The following year, another compilation album (&quot;A Love Song Collection&quot;) also charted.

On August 26, 2008, Rogers released &quot;50 Years&quot; exclusively at Cracker Barrel stores. The album included some of Rogers&#x27;s greatest hits, plus three new songs. The release is designed to celebrate Rogers&#x27;s 50th year in the music business. In 2007, the England national rugby union team adopted Rogers song &quot;The Gambler&quot; as their unofficial 2007 Rugby World Cup anthem, after hearing prop Matt Stevens playing it in the team hotel. Before the semi-final against France and the final against South Africa, Rogers sent video messages of support to the team in light of them choosing his song.
In 2008, Rogers toured with his Christmas Show. He split the show up, making the first half his &quot;best of&quot; and the second half his Christmas songs. In 2009, Rogers embarked on his 50th Anniversary Tour.

On April 10, 2010, a TV special was taped, &quot;Kenny Rogers: The First 50 Years&quot;. Dolly Parton and Lionel Richie were among those set to perform with Rogers during a show celebrating his contribution to country, blues and pop music. It took place at the MGM Grand in Foxwoods. The TV special was Executive Produced by Gabriel Gornell and Colleen Seldin and aired on GAC in North America and BBC worldwide.

On June 10, 2012, Rogers appeared on stage with the musical group Phish to perform his hit song &quot;The Gambler&quot; at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival. Also in 2012, Rogers re-recorded the hit song &quot;Lady&quot;, a duet with its songwriter Lionel Richie, on Richie&#x27;s album &quot;Tuskegee&quot;. The pair also performed the song live at the 2012 ACM concert, &quot;Lionel Richie &amp; Friends&quot;.

On April 10, 2013, the CMA announced that Rogers would be a 2013 inductee into the Country Music Hall of Fame, along with Cowboy Jack Clement and Bobby Bare. In June 2013, he performed at the Glastonbury Festival in England in the Sunday afternoon &#x27;Legends&#x27; slot.

In 2013, Rogers recorded a new album with the name &quot;You Can&#x27;t Make Old Friends&quot;. This album included the title track, a new duet with Dolly Parton, which was his first single released in six years.

Rogers recorded 65 albums and sold over 165 million records.

===Retirement===
In 2015, Rogers announced his farewell tour, titled &quot;The Gambler&#x27;s Last Deal&quot;. He stated his intention to retire from touring at its completion, although he was considering the possibility of recording another studio album. In announcing the tour, Rogers indicated at the time that his final tour appearance would be on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show. Concert dates were scheduled through 2018 and included visits to the United States, Australia, Scotland, Ireland, England, The Netherlands and Switzerland. On April 5, 2018, it was announced that Rogers canceled his remaining tour as advised by doctors due to a series of health challenges.

Rogers&#x27;s final concert in Nashville took place on October 25, 2017, at the Bridgestone Arena where he was joined by an array of guest artists including Linda Davis, Elle King, Little Big Town, Lionel Richie, Billy Currington, Lee Greenwood, The Flaming Lips, The Oak Ridge Boys, Justin Moore, Travis Tritt, the Judds, Kris Kristofferson, Alison Krauss, Chris Stapleton, Lady Antebellum, Idina Menzel, Crystal Gayle, Reba McEntire and Jamey Johnson. The concert also included a special appearance by long-time friend Dolly Parton, who serenaded Rogers with her signature &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; and performed &quot;You Can&#x27;t Make Old Friends&quot; and &quot;Islands in the Stream&quot; with Rogers for the final time.

===Bloodline===
Although Rogers used many session musicians to play instruments on his recordings, he was backed on tours by the group Bloodline since 1976. The group originally started as a three-piece. In &quot;The Journey&quot; (a 2006 documentary about his career) Rogers said he did not understand singers who changed their touring band every year, and that he stuck with Bloodline as they already &quot;know the songs&quot;. Members of Bloodline have included Steve Glassmeyer, Chuck Jacobs, Randy Dorman, Gene Golden, Bobby Daniels, Rick Harper, Edgar Struble, Lynn Hammann, Warren Hartman, Gene Sisk, Brian Franklin, Mike Zimmerman and Amber Randall.

==Acting and other ventures==
Rogers also had success as an actor. His 1982 movie &quot;Six Pack&quot;, in which he played a race-car driver, took in more than $20 million at the United States box office, while made-for-TV movies such as &quot;The Gambler&quot; series, &quot;Christmas in America&quot;, and &quot;Coward of the County&quot; (based on hit songs of his) topped ratings lists. He also served as host and narrator for the A&amp;E historical series &quot;The Real West&quot;.

Rogers said that photography was once his obsession, before it morphed into a passion. He authored the photo books &quot;Kenny Rogers&#x27; America&quot; (1986) and &quot;Your Friends and Mine&quot; (1987).
As an entrepreneur, he collaborated with former Kentucky Fried Chicken CEO John Y. Brown Jr. in 1991 to start up the restaurant chain Kenny Rogers Roasters. The chicken and ribs chain, which is similar to Boston Market, featured in an episode of the NBC sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot; called &quot;The Chicken Roaster&quot;. Season four of the TV series &quot;Fresh Off the Boat&quot; depicts the chain as owning a share of Louis Huang&#x27;s Cattleman&#x27;s Ranch restaurant and then filing for bankruptcy. Rogers is shown from the back but played by Jeff Pomerantz in the episode &quot;Let Me Go, Bro&quot;.

Rogers put his name to the Gambler Chassis Co., a sprint car racing manufacturer started by C. K. Spurlock in Hendersonville, Tennessee. The company used the name from Rogers&#x27;s hit song &quot;The Gambler&quot;. During the 1980s and 1990s, Gambler was one of the fastest and widely used Sprintcars, with such drivers as Steve Kinser, Sammy Swindell and Doug Wolfgang driving the cars to victory in the World of Outlaws and the famous Knoxville Nationals. Gambler sprintcars were also successful in Australia, with drivers such as Garry Rush and Steve Brazier using Gamblers to win multiple Australian Sprintcar Championships. Rush also used a Gambler chassis to win the unofficial 1987 World Sprintcar Championship at the Claremont Speedway in Perth, Western Australia.

In October 2012, Rogers released the book &quot;Luck or Something Like it: A Memoir&quot; about his ups and downs in his musical career.

In 2014, Rogers appeared as himself in a GEICO commercial, singing part of his song &quot;The Gambler&quot; &quot;a cappella&quot; while acting as the dealer in a card game.

==Personal life==
At Beaver Dam Farms, a former estate in Colbert, Georgia, Rogers kept a pet goat named Smitty. He originally acquired the animal from a friend in 2008. According to Rogers, the goat was &quot;(his) center&quot;, providing a calming influence after long and stressful touring schedules.

===Marriages===
Rogers was married five times and had five children. His first marriage was to Janice Gordon on May 15, 1958; they divorced in April 1960 with one child, Carole Lynne. He married his second wife, Jean, in October 1960 and divorced her in 1963. His third marriage was to Margo Anderson in October 1963; they divorced in 1975, with one child. He married his fourth wife, actress Marianne Gordon, on October 1, 1977, and they divorced in 1993, with one son, Christopher. His fifth marriage was to Wanda Miller on June 1, 1997. They had twin sons and were married for 22 years until his death.

===Health decline and death===

Rogers&#x27;s seven-decade career wound down in 2017, as he encountered health problems that included a diagnosis of bladder cancer. On March 20, 2020, Rogers died at the age of 81, while under hospice care at his home in Sandy Springs, Georgia. He was interred in Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta.

<text>Aristotelis &quot;Telly&quot; Savalas (January 21, 1922 – January 22, 1994) was a Greek-American actor. Noted for his bald head and deep, resonant voice, he is perhaps best known for portraying Lt. Theo Kojak on the crime drama series &quot;Kojak&quot; (1973–1978) and James Bond archvillain Ernst Stavro Blofeld in the film &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (1969).

Savalas&#x27; other films include &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; (1962), &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965), &quot;Genghis Khan&quot; (1965), &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot; (1965), &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; (1967), &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot; (1970), &quot;Horror Express&quot; (1972), &quot;Lisa and the Devil&quot; (1974), &quot;Escape to Athena&quot; (1979), &quot;Border Cop&quot; (1980) and &quot;Mind Twister&quot; (1993). For &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot;, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor.

Savalas released a cover of the Bread song &quot;If&quot;, which became a UK number-one single in 1975.

==Early life==
Aristotelis Savalas () was born in Garden City, New York, on January 21, 1922, the second of five children born to Greek parents Christina (née Kapsalis), an artist who was a native of Sparta, and Nick Savalas, a restaurant owner. His paternal grandparents came from Ierakas. Savalas and his brother, Gus, sold newspapers and polished shoes to help support the family. Savalas initially spoke only Greek when he entered grade school, but later learned English. He attended Cobbett Junior High School in Lynn, Massachusetts. He won a spelling bee there in 1934; due to an oversight, he did not receive his prize until 1991, when the school principal and the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; awarded it to him.

Savalas graduated from Sewanhaka High School in Floral Park, New York, in 1940. A renowned swimmer, he worked as a beach lifeguard after graduation from high school. On one occasion, though, he was unsuccessful in saving a father from drowning; as he attempted resuscitation, the man&#x27;s two children stood nearby crying for their father to wake up. This affected Savalas so much that he spent the rest of his life promoting water safety, and later made all six of his children take swimming lessons.

===Military service===
Savalas was drafted into the United States Army in 1941. Savalas served in Company C, 12th Medical Training Battalion, 4th Medical Training Regiment at Camp Pickett, Virginia from 1941 to 1943. He was discharged from the Army with the rank of corporal in 1943 after being severely injured in a car accident. Savalas spent more than a year recuperating in hospital with a broken pelvis, sprained ankle and concussion. He then attended the Armed Forces Institute, where he studied radio and television production.

Savalas received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology from Columbia&#x27;s School of General Studies in 1946 and started working on a master&#x27;s degree while preparing for medical school.

==Career==
===Early roles===
After the war, he worked for the U.S. State Department as host of the &quot;Your Voice of America&quot; series, then at ABC News. In 1950, Savalas hosted a radio show called &quot;The Coffeehouse in New York City&quot;.

Savalas began as an executive director and then as senior director of the news special events at ABC. He then became an executive producer for the &quot;Gillette Cavalcade of Sports&quot;, where he gave Howard Cosell his first job in television. Before his acting career took off, Savalas directed Scott Vincent and Howard Cosell in &quot;Report to New York&quot;, WABC-TV&#x27;s first regularly scheduled news program in fall 1959.

Savalas did not consider acting as a career until asked if he could recommend an actor who could do a European accent. He did, but as the friend in question could not go, Savalas himself went to cover for his friend and ended up being cast on &quot;And Bring Home a Baby&quot;, an episode of &quot;Armstrong Circle Theatre&quot; in January 1958. He appeared on two more episodes of the series in 1959 and 1960, one, acting alongside a young Sydney Pollack. He was also in a version of &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot;.

He quickly became much in demand as a guest star on TV shows, appearing in &quot;Sunday Showcase&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Dow Hour of Great Mysteries&quot; (an adaptation of &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot;), &quot;Naked City&quot; (alongside Claude Rains), &quot;The Witness&quot; (playing Lucky Luciano in one episode and Al Capone in another), &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, and &quot;The Aquanauts.&quot; He was a regular on the short-lived NBC series &quot;Acapulco&quot; (1961) with Ralph Taeger and James Coburn.

Savalas made his film debut in &quot;Mad Dog Coll&quot; (1961), playing a cop. His work had impressed fellow actor Burt Lancaster, who arranged for Savalas to be cast in the John Frankenheimer-directed &quot;The Young Savages&quot; (also 1961 and again playing a cop). Pollack worked on the film as an acting coach.

In one of his most acclaimed performances, Savalas reunited with Lancaster and Frankenheimer for &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; (1962), where he was nominated for the Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor. The same year, he appeared as a private detective in &quot;Cape Fear&quot; (directed by J. Lee Thompson with whom Savalas would work in future films), and &quot;The Interns&quot;, reprising his role from the latter film in &quot;The New Interns&quot; (1964).

Savalas also guest-starred in a number of TV series during the decade including &quot;The New Breed&quot;, &quot;The Detectives&quot;, &quot;Ben Casey&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (the episode &quot;Living Doll&quot;), &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, and &quot;Arrest and Trial&quot; among others.

===Baldness and stardom===
He continued in supporting roles in films such as &quot;The Man from the Diners&#x27; Club&quot;, &quot;Love Is a Ball&quot;, and &quot;Johnny Cool&quot; (all 1963). Already at a late stage of male pattern baldness, he shaved his head to play Pontius Pilate in &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965) and kept his head shaven for the rest of his life. He reunited with J. Lee Thompson in &quot;John Goldfarb, Please Come Home!&quot; (1965), and was one of many names in &quot;Genghis Khan&quot; (also 1965).

He was part of an all-star cast in &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; (1967), playing Archer Maggott (the worst of the dozen), in a role Jack Palance turned down. He reunited with Burt Lancaster and Sydney Pollack in the Western &quot;The Scalphunters&quot; (1968), and also featured in the comedy &quot;Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell&quot; (also 1968)—noted as one of his favorite roles—and the all-star action movie &quot;Mackenna&#x27;s Gold&quot; (1969), his third film for J. Lee Thompson. Savalas attributed his success to &quot;his complete ability to be himself.&quot;

Savalas&#x27; first leading role in film was in the British crime comedy &quot;Crooks and Coronets&quot; (1969). The same year, he appeared in the James Bond movie &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, playing Ernst Stavro Blofeld. He continued to appear in films during the 1970s including &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot; (1970) (with Clint Eastwood); &quot;Clay Pigeon&quot; (1971); and several European features such as &quot;Violent City&quot; (1970) (with Charles Bronson); &quot;A Town Called Bastard&quot; (1971); &quot;Horror Express&quot; (with Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee); &quot;A Reason to Live, a Reason to Die&quot;; the title role in &quot;Pancho Villa&quot; (all 1972); and &quot;Redneck&quot; (1973). He reunited with Christopher Lee in the 1976 thriller &quot;Killer Force&quot;, and also appeared in Peter Hyams&#x27; &quot;Capricorn One&quot; (1978).

&quot;I had worked my way up to star billing&quot;, he later said, &quot;when the bottom dropped out of the movie business. I could have stayed in Europe and made Italian movies, but I discovered the big difference between an Italian and American movie is that in the American movie, you get paid.&quot;

===&quot;Kojak&quot;===
Savalas first played Lt. Theophilus &quot;Theo&quot; Kojak in the TV movie &quot;The Marcus–Nelson Murders&quot; (CBS, 1973), which was based on the real-life Career Girls murder case.

Kojak was a bald New York City detective with a fondness for lollipops and whose tagline was &quot;Who loves ya, baby?&quot; (He also liked to say, &quot;Everybody should have a little Greek in them.&quot;) Although the lollipop gimmick was added to indulge his sweet tooth, Savalas also smoked heavily onscreen—cigarettes, cigarillos, and cigars—throughout the first season&#x27;s episodes. The lollipops had apparently given him three cavities, and were part of an (unsuccessful) effort by Kojak (and Savalas himself) to curb his smoking. Critic Clive James explained the lead actor&#x27;s appeal as Kojak: &quot;Telly Savalas can make bad slang sound like good slang and good slang sound like lyric poetry. It isn&#x27;t what he is, so much as the way he talks, that gets you tuning in.&quot;

David Shipman later wrote: &quot;Kojak was sympathetic to outcasts and ruthless with social predators. The show maintained a high quality to the end, mixing tension with some laughs and always anxious to tackle civic issues, one of its &quot;raisons d&#x27;etre&quot; in the first place. It was required viewing in Britain every Saturday evening for eight years. To almost everyone everywhere, Kojak means Savalas and vice versa, but to Savalas himself, the series was merely an interval, albeit a long one, in a distinguished career.&quot;

&quot;Kojak&quot; aired on CBS for five seasons from October 24, 1973, until March 18, 1978, with 118 episodes produced. The role won Savalas an Emmy and two Golden Globes for Best Actor in a Drama Series. Co-stars on the show included Savalas&#x27; younger brother George as Detective Stavros, a sensitive, wild-haired, quiet, comedic foil to Kojak&#x27;s street-wise humor in an otherwise dark dramatic series, Kevin Dobson as Kojak&#x27;s trusted young partner, Det. Bobby Crocker, whose on-screen chemistry with Savalas was a success story of 1970s television, and Dan Frazer as Captain Frank McNeil.

Due to a decline in ratings, the series was cancelled by CBS in 1978. Savalas and Frazer were the only actors to appear in all 118 episodes. Savalas was unhappy about the show&#x27;s demise but got the chance to reprise the Kojak persona in several television movies, starting in 1985. The first film, subtitled &quot;The Belarus File&quot; and broadcast in February 1985, reunited Savalas with several of his co-stars from the series: younger brother George, Dan Frazer, Mark Russell (Det. Saperstein) and Vince Conti (Det. Rizzo); this marked those actors&#x27; final appearances in the &quot;Kojak&quot; franchise.

A further six &quot;Kojak&quot; TV movies were produced, titled &quot;&quot; (1987), &quot;Ariana&quot;, &quot;Fatal Flaw&quot; (both 1989), &quot;Flowers for Matty&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Always Something&quot;—with Kevin Dobson reprising his role of Bobby Crocker, now an assistant district attorney—and &quot;None So Blind&quot; (all 1990).

===Later work===
Savalas wrote, directed, and starred in the 1977 independent thriller &quot;Beyond Reason&quot;, but the film was not released in cinemas; it was made available only on home media in 1985. Savalas was part of an all-star cast in the movies &quot;Escape to Athena&quot;, &quot;Beyond the Poseidon Adventure&quot; (both 1979), and &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot; (1984), and continued to appear in a number of film and television guest roles during the 1980s, including &quot;Border Cop&quot; (1980) and &quot;Faceless&quot; (1988), the series &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; (1981), and two episodes each of &quot;The Love Boat&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Equalizer&quot; (1987); the latter series was produced by James McAdams, who had also produced &quot;Kojak.&quot;

Savalas was the lead actor in the TV movie &quot;Hellinger&#x27;s Law&quot; (1981), which was originally planned as a pilot for a series, but ultimately never materialized.

In 1992, he appeared in three episodes of the TV series &quot;The Commish&quot; (his son-in-law was one of the producers). This was Savalas&#x27; final television role. He appeared in two further feature films before his death, &quot;Mind Twister&quot; (1993) and the posthumous release &quot;Backfire!&quot; (1995).

===Other achievements===
With the $1,000,000 he was paid for &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; in 1969, Savalas bought The Bridge House, in Ferndown, Dorset, England. A couple of relatives ran it for him as a hotel.

As a singer, Savalas had some chart success. His spoken word version of Bread&#x27;s &quot;If&quot;, produced by Snuff Garrett, reached number one in both the UK and Ireland in March 1975, but just number 88 in Canada, and his follow-up, a version of &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot; peaked at No. 47 in the UK. In February 1981, his version of Don Williams&#x27; &quot;Some Broken Hearts Never Mend&quot; topped the charts in Switzerland. He worked with composer and producer John Cacavas on many albums, including &quot;Telly&quot; (1974) (which peaked at No. 12 in the UK and No. 49 in Australia) and &quot;Who Loves Ya, Baby&quot; (1976).

In the late 1970s, Savalas narrated three UK travelogues titled &quot;Telly Savalas Looks at Portsmouth&quot;, &quot;Telly Savalas Looks at Aberdeen&quot;, and &quot;Telly Savalas Looks at Birmingham&quot;. They were produced by Harold Baim and were examples of quota quickies, which were then part of a requirement that cinemas in the United Kingdom show a set percentage of British-produced films. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Savalas appeared in commercials for the Players&#x27; Club Gold Card. In 1982, along with Bob Hope and Linda Evans, he participated in the &quot;world premiere&quot; television ad introducing Diet Coke to Americans. On October 28, 1987, Savalas hosted &quot;Return to the Titanic Live&quot;, a two-hour television special broadcast from Cité des Sciences et de l&#x27;Industrie in Paris, which was widely criticized as being insensitive and for making light of the tragic sinking soon after its wreck was discovered. He also hosted the 1989 video &quot;UFOs and Channeling.&quot;

He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1983. In 1999, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked him number 18 on its 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time list.

==Personal life==
Savalas was married three times. In 1948, after his father&#x27;s death from bladder cancer, Savalas married his college sweetheart, Katherine Nicolaides. Their daughter Christina, named after his mother, was born in 1950. In 1957, Katherine filed for divorce. She urged him to move back to his mother&#x27;s house during that same year. While Savalas was going broke, he founded the Garden City Theater Center in his native Garden City. While working there, he met Marilyn Gardner, a theater teacher. They married in 1960. Marilyn gave birth to their daughter, Penelope, in 1961. A second daughter, Candace, was born in 1963. They divorced in 1974, after a long separation.

In January 1969, while working on the movie &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, Savalas met Sally Adams (billed as Dani Sheridan, one of Blofeld&#x27;s &quot;Angels of Death&quot;), an actress 24 years his junior, whose daughter from a previous relationship is Nicollette Sheridan. Savalas later moved in with Sally, who gave birth to their son Nicholas Savalas on February 24, 1973. Although Savalas and Sally Adams never legally married, she went by the name Sally Savalas. They stopped living together in December 1978; she filed a palimony lawsuit against him in 1980, demanding support not only for herself and their son, but also for Nicollette.

In 1977, during the last season of &quot;Kojak&quot;, Savalas met Julie Hovland, a travel agent from Minnesota. They were married from 1984 until his death and had two children: Christian, an entrepreneur, singer, and songwriter, and Ariana, an actress and singer/songwriter. Savalas was close friends with actor John Aniston, and was godfather to his daughter Jennifer, a successful TV and film actress.

Savalas held a degree in psychology and was a world-class poker player who finished 21st at the main event in the 1992 World Series of Poker. He was also a motorcycle racer and lifeguard. His other hobbies and interests included golfing, swimming, reading romantic books, watching football, traveling, collecting luxury cars and gambling. He loved horse racing and bought a racehorse with film director and producer Howard W. Koch. Naming the horse Telly&#x27;s Pop, it won several races in 1975, including the Norfolk Stakes and Del Mar Futurity.

In his capacity as producer for &quot;Kojak&quot;, he gave many stars their first break, as Burt Lancaster had done for him. He was considered by those who knew him to be a generous, graceful, compassionate man. He was also a strong contributor to his Greek Orthodox roots through the Saint Sophia and Saint Nicholas cathedrals in Los Angeles and was the sponsor of bringing electricity in the 1970s to his ancestral home, Ierakas.

Savalas had a minor physical handicap in that his left index finger was deformed. This deformed digit was often indicated on screen; the &quot;Kojak&quot; episode &quot;Conspiracy of Fear&quot; in which a close-up of Savalas holding his chin in his hand clearly shows the permanently bent finger.

As a philanthropist and philhellene, Savalas supported many Hellenic causes and made friends in major cities around the world. In Chicago, he often met with Illinois state senators Steven G. Nash and Samuel C. Maragos.

In 1993, Savalas appeared on an Australian TV show, &quot;The Extraordinary&quot;, with a paranormal tale about a hitchhiking mystery that he could not explain.

Along with his brother, Savalas was a Freemason.

In the 1980s, Savalas began to lose close relatives. His brother George Savalas, who played Stavros in the original series, died in 1985 of leukemia at age 60. His mother died in 1988. In late 1989, Savalas was diagnosed with transitional-cell cancer of the bladder.

==Death==
Savalas died on January 22, 1994, of complications of prostate and bladder cancer at the Sheraton-Universal Hotel in Universal City, California, at the age of 72. He had lived at the Sheraton in Universal City for 20 years, becoming such a fixture at the hotel bar that it was renamed Telly&#x27;s. 

Savalas was interred at the George Washington section of Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles, California. The funeral, held in the Saint Sophia Greek Orthodox Church, was attended by his third wife, Julie, and his brother Gus. His first two wives, Katherine and Marilyn, also attended with their own children. The mourners included Angie Dickinson, Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Sorbo, Frank Sinatra, Don Rickles, and several of Savalas&#x27;s &quot;Kojak&quot; co-stars including Kevin Dobson and Dan Frazer.

<text>Space Jam is a 1996 American live-action/animated sports comedy film directed by Joe Pytka and written by Leo Benvenuti, Steve Rudnick, Timothy Harris, and Herschel Weingrod. The film stars basketball player Michael Jordan as himself; the live-action cast also includes Wayne Knight and Theresa Randle, as well as cameos by Bill Murray and several NBA players, while Billy West, Dee Bradley Baker, Kath Soucie and Danny DeVito headline the voice cast. The film follows Jordan as he is brought out of retirement by the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters to help them win a basketball match against invading aliens intent on enslaving them as amusement park attractions.

&quot;Space Jam&quot; was the first film to be produced by Warner Bros. Feature Animation and was released theatrically in the United States on November 15, 1996, by Warner Bros. under its Family Entertainment label. Critics were divided over its premise of combining Jordan and his profession with the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters, while praising the technical achievements of its intertwining of live-action and animation. It was a commercial success, grossing over $250 million worldwide to become the highest-grossing basketball film of all time until 2022, as well the tenth-highest-grossing film of 1996.

A standalone sequel, &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;, was released in 2021, with LeBron James in the lead role. The sequel failed to match the commercial success of the first film and received generally negative reviews.

== Plot ==

In 1973, a young Michael Jordan tells his father, James, about his dreams of playing in the NBA. Twenty years later, following James’ death, Jordan retires from basketball to pursue a career in baseball.

In outer space, amusement park Moron Mountain is in decline. Its proprietor, Mr. Swackhammer, learns of the Looney Tunes from the Nerdlucks, his quintet of alien minions, and orders them to abduct the Tunes to serve as attractions. The Nerdlucks enter the Tunes&#x27; universe hidden in the center of the Earth and hold them hostage before Bugs Bunny convinces them to allow the Tunes to defend themselves. The Tunes take advantage of the Nerdlucks&#x27; small stature and challenge them to a basketball game. After seeing a documentary about basketball, the Nerdlucks infiltrate various NBA games, stealing the talents of Charles Barkley, Shawn Bradley, Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson, and Muggsy Bogues. They use these talents to transform into hulking and adept versions of themselves known as the &quot;Monstars&quot;.

Deciding they need help, the Looney Tunes pull Jordan into their universe as he golfs with Bill Murray, Larry Bird, and Jordan&#x27;s assistant, Stan Podolak, where Bugs explains their situation to Jordan. However, Jordan is initially reluctant to help, but later agrees after a confrontation with the Monstars, and forms the &quot;Tune Squad” with the Tunes; they are joined by Lola Bunny, with whom Bugs is enamored. To prepare himself, Jordan sends Bugs and Daffy Duck to his house in the live-action world to obtain his basketball gear. Jordan&#x27;s children aid them and agree to keep the game a secret, while Stan, searching for Jordan, notices Bugs and Daffy, follows them to their world, and joins the team. Meanwhile, the incapacity of the five players results in a nationwide panic that culminates in the season&#x27;s suspension. The players unsuccessfully try to restore their skills through various methods.

The game between the Tune Squad and the Monstars commences, with Swackhammer arriving to observe. The Monstars dominate the first half, lowering the Tune Squad&#x27;s morale. During halftime, Stan surreptitiously learns how the Monstars obtained their talent and informs the Tune Squad. Disguising a bottle of water as &quot;secret stuff&quot;, Bugs and Jordan motivate the Tune Squad, who improve in the second half using their cartoon antics. During a time-out, Jordan raises the stakes with Swackhammer: if the Tune Squad wins, the Monstars must relinquish their stolen talent, and if the Monstars win, Jordan will spend the rest of his life being Moron Mountain&#x27;s newest attraction. On Swackhammer&#x27;s command, the Monstars play more aggressively, injuring most of the Tune Squad.

With only ten seconds left in the game, the Tune Squad is down by one point and one player, with only Jordan, Bugs, Lola, and Daffy still able to play. Murray unexpectedly arrives and joins the team. In the final seconds, Jordan gains the ball with Murray&#x27;s assistance but is pulled back by the Monstars. On Bugs&#x27; advice, Jordan uses cartoon physics to extend his arm and achieve a slam dunk, winning the game with a buzzer beater. After Swackhammer scolds the Monstars for their failure, Jordan helps them realize that they only served him because they were once smaller. Having had enough of their boss&#x27;s behavior towards them, the Monstars insert Swackhammer inside a missile that sends him to the moon. After relinquishing their stolen talent, the Nerdlucks decide to join the Tunes, while Jordan and Stan return to Earth and return the talent to the five players, whose remarks convince Jordan to return to the NBA.

==Production==
===Development===

In 1992 and 1993, two Super Bowl Nike ads, &quot;Hare Jordan&quot; and &quot;Aerospace Jordan&quot; respectively, aired on television and featured Michael Jordan with the character Bugs Bunny. Wieden+Kennedy creative director Jim Riswold conceived the &quot;Hare Jordan&quot; campaign following the popularity of advertisements where Jordan played with Mars Blackmon (played by Spike Lee), a character from &quot;She&#x27;s Gotta Have It&quot; (1986); he chose Bugs Bunny for his next campaign because the character was his &quot;childhood hero&quot;. Directed by Joe Pytka, &quot;Hare Jordan&quot; took six months and a $1 million budget to make. It was hindered by reluctance from Warner Bros. to allow Nike to modernize Bugs&#x27; character; however, the commercial success of both ads &quot;was a nice bit of research for Warner Bros. to understand that the Bugs character still had relevance and to tie it in with Michael&quot;, explained Pytka. This led to the company green-lighting a film featuring Jordan and Bugs, which came out of a plane meeting between a Nike executive and producer Ivan Reitman. Jordan was offered movie deals previously, but his manager, David Falk, turned them all down because he felt the basketball icon could only act as himself.

The project was closed when Jordan retired from basketball in 1993, only to be reopened in 1995 when Jordan returned as a basketball player. Falk pitched the idea to several major studios, without a story or script written. One of them was Warner Bros., which tried to create more &quot;adult, sophisticated material&quot; that deviated from the formula set by Disney in the animated film market. After Warner Bros. initially rejected Falk&#x27;s pitch, he called the consumer products division leader, Dan Romanelli, reacting in surprise the studio would turn down a project having potential of high-selling merchandise.

Pytka was informed about the project only months before the start of principal photography; in addition to being hired as director, he also revised the script, including writing a scene where Jordan hits a home run after he returns to Earth that was filmed, but ultimately never used. Spike Lee was also interested in helping Pytka with the screenplay, but Warner Bros. blocked him from the project out of dissatisfaction from how he funded &quot;Malcolm X&quot; (1992).

=== Casting ===
According to Pytka, it was difficult to get most actors involved with &quot;Space Jam&quot; due to its odd premise: &quot;I mean, they&#x27;re going to work with an animated character and an athlete — are you serious? They just didn&#x27;t want to do it.&quot; Before Wayne Knight was cast as Stan, his initial choices were Michael J. Fox and Chevy Chase, whom he had worked with on Doritos commercials; Warner Bros. rejected both actors. Jason Alexander also turned down the role. The easiest actors to obtain were the NBA players, except for Gheorghe Mureșan. Bill Murray&#x27;s appearance was present in the script from the beginning, but the filmmakers were unable to book him until filming started; there are rumors that Jordan begged Murray to be in the film.

Reitman, serious about the voice actors for the established &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters being far better than their original voice actor, Mel Blanc, and not just replications, was very involved in the voice casting. Joe Alaskey, one of Blanc&#x27;s successors since the latter&#x27;s death, was put by Reitman through a set of auditions, which lasted for months until Alaskey grew tired of auditioning and backed out from the project. Billy West learned of &quot;Space Jam&quot; through Reitman on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, who was producing Stern&#x27;s film &quot;Private Parts&quot; (1997). Reitman was impressed by West&#x27;s voice talent and asked him if he could audition for &quot;Space Jam&quot;. West accepted, and after doing an audition, he landed the roles of Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. The casting directors originally planned several voice cameos; however, that did not work out, and Danny DeVito ended up being the only celebrity voice actor in the film, which was for Mr. Swackhammer, who was originally planned to be played by Jack Palance. Swackhammer was also planned to be a live-action character until the very final days of development, with Dennis Hopper possibly playing the role due to his friendship with Pytka.

=== Scale ===
The Classic Animation faction of Warner Bros., which animated the commercials and was located in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, was originally planned to be the only company responsible for &quot;Space Jam&quot;. However, after only a week, the animation work was so complicated that Warner Bros. contacted more studios, including reassigning the Feature Animation division in Glendale from working on &quot;Quest for Camelot&quot; (1998) to &quot;Space Jam&quot;. Ten of Classic Animation&#x27;s members, including the production&#x27;s animation director Tony Cervone, were taken out of the faction to become involved all throughout production, and development artists were reassigned to animating jobs, including supervising animator Bruce Woodside, who had little faith in the project: &quot;Like so many other animators, I adore the classic Warner Bros. characters, but I really had little hope that tying them to the massive anchor of an apparently doomed marketing scheme could actually give them a successful second life in features&quot;.

After Cervone was hired as animation director, Jerry Rees contacted Bruce W. Smith about being another animation director on the film; Rees was fired by the time Smith joined, and Pytka hired Smith to direct the animation sequences alongside Cervone. Before January 1996, when animation production was put into overdrive, none of the animators&#x27; drafts or concepts for how the film should look met with Reitman&#x27;s approval; Bill Perkins joined that month as animation art director, and when first arriving at the Sherman Oaks division, &quot;we only had around eight months to do about 52 minutes of animation&quot; and &quot;it was just kind of a little skeleton crew.&quot; Cervone highlighted Reitman&#x27;s role as supervisor: &quot;It started off as a string of gags with no structure, and he helped a lot with that.&quot; The drafting process involved the animators and artists using the original cartoons as references. Ultimately, they went with Bob Clampett&#x27;s style of animation due to being wilder than Chuck Jones&#x27; style.

Production of &quot;Space Jam&quot; totaled around 19 months, with filming taking up ten of them; this was half the time of any other film of its kind according to Smith. The animation was done at a very
quick pace by more than 700 workers from 18 studios in London, Canada, California and Ohio, starting January 1996 by the recently joined producers Ron Tippe and Allison Abbate. In trying to track the huge amount work done at the 18 studios, Tippe hung stills of all the shots throughout the Feature Animation faction&#x27;s hallways, with completed ones marked in red.

Features about the film&#x27;s production, including one from the official website, emphasized its state-of-the art computer technology when it came to its live-action/animation hybrid; &quot;this film could have not been made two years ago,&quot; claimed Cervone in 1996. Due to its mixture of various art mediums as well as the &quot;broad sense of humor and entertainment&quot; unique to the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, Smith considered &quot;Space Jam&quot; an important part of diversifying the animation industry. &quot;Space Jam&quot; broke the record for amount of composited shots in a featured film, &quot;roughly 1,043&quot; according to Tippe, as well as a record number of FX shots, with around 1,100 in a single 90-minute film; &quot;Independence Day&quot; (1996), released the same year, had 700 FX shots within two hours of screen time. Tippe claimed the film would have, at most, &quot;multiple characters, multiple levels of effects and, in some cases, up to 70 elements&quot; in one shot.

=== Filming ===
&quot;Space Jam&quot; was one of the first-ever productions to be shot on a virtual studio. Jordan filmed in a 360-degree green screen room with motion trackers; around him were green-suited
NBA players and improv actors from the Groundlings Theatre and School serving as placement identifiers for the animated characters, with a CGI background replica of a real-life setting chroma-keyed in. Although Bill Murray initially came in only to work on the golf course scene, he then wanted to be in the climactic basketball game after Pytka showed him the process of how he directed the live-action/animation scenes.

Concept drawings and discussions between the animators and Pytka about how the animation would be incorporated into the live-action shots took place on set during shooting, and re-writes to the script would be done daily. As an experienced commercial and music video director working on a sports film, Pytka took on fast, unlimited camera movements and Dutch angles; this made integrating the characters into the shots challenging for the animators. To connect the real and animated worlds together, blue-screen shots of miniatures by Vision Crew Unlimited were used; these include a Christo-inspired interpretation of The Forum arena for exterior shots, city rooftops for a transition scene with a wide skyline view of Chicago serving as the chroma-keyed background, and space ship parts initially produced by Boss Film Studios for a Philip Morris advertisement.

===Music===

The soundtrack sold enough albums to be certified as 6-times Platinum. The song &quot;I Believe I Can Fly&quot; by musical artist R. Kelly earned him three Grammy Awards. Other tracks included a cover of Steve Miller Band&#x27;s &quot;Fly Like an Eagle&quot; (by Seal), &quot;Hit &#x27;Em High (The Monstars&#x27; Anthem)&quot; (by B-Real, Busta Rhymes, Coolio, LL Cool J, and Method Man), &quot;Basketball Jones&quot; (by Barry White &amp; Chris Rock), &quot;Pump up the Jam&quot; (by Technotronic), &quot;I Turn to You&quot; (by All-4-One) and &quot;For You I Will&quot; (by Monica). The film&#x27;s title song was performed by the Quad City DJ&#x27;s.

==Animation and design==

===Technology===
&quot;Space Jam&quot; was one of the earliest animated productions to use digital technology. 2D animation and backgrounds were first done on paper with pencil at the Sherman Oaks studio before being scanned into Silicon Graphics Image files through Cambridge Animation Systems&#x27; software Animo and were then sent to Cinesite via a File Transfer Protocol, for its team to touch upon, digitally color, and composite into shots in Photoshop before being sent back to Sherman Oaks. Unlike previous projects that used the Cineon digital film system, Cinesite used the quicker Inferno and Flame systems for &quot;Space Jam&quot;. The film&#x27;s Holly render farm consisted of 16 central processing units, four gigabytes of shared memory, and took up one million dollars of the film&#x27;s budget, &quot;on top of which the deskside boxes had 256 megabytes of RAM to splurge on whatever scene you needed to create and render,&quot; explained Privett.

Cinesite had begun developing proprietary software for motion tracking when working on &quot;Under Siege 2: Dark Territory&quot; (1995), which involved most of its shots incorporating a digital background; this made the company prepared for &quot;Space Jam&quot;, which consists of a bunch of moving camera shots with 3D backgrounds to be added. The CGI backgrounds moved around with the motion trackers via Cinesite&#x27;s proprietary software Ball Buster, which identified the markers through algorithm. To avoid mistakes in the visuals as much as possible, Cinesite artists worked on the film by frame instead of viewing each shot as a whole; those, such as Jonathan Privett were dissatisfied with the method, primarily because it put them under much pressure: &quot;We much preferred the good old fashioned run-at-24-fps, just-as-the-viewer-sees-it approach.&quot;

===Backgrounds===
The design of the stadium was heavily dictated by that of the film&#x27;s many characters, and it was such a long process that it went through 94 revisions, explained Cinesite digital effects supervisor Carlos Arguello: &quot;Tasmanian Devil was brown so we couldn&#x27;t have a wooden brown upper level, and there were so many colorful characters, and Michael Jordan and everybody had to look good in all the scenes.&quot;

For scenes that take place in the stadium, shortcuts were made. For crane shots of the crowd of 15,000 people in the final basketball sequence, it was created with live-action extras, cloned animated crowd members, and a few computer-generated characters walking around the aisles in the stadium. When these shots involved camera movements, a few 2D extras were animated to reflect the angle of the camera, but much lighting was added to distract from the crowd, thus minimizing this work. The reflections of the floor on the gym were also &quot;fake[d]&quot; as raytracing would&#x27;ve meant rendering it for four days per a few frames.

===Characters===
Abbate suggested the hurried workflow of the animators bled into the character animation, resulting in a quick-witted style the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoons are most known for.

Although the animators had to work with almost 100 characters, they were the most focused on Bugs and Daffy not only because they were principal characters, but also because they were the most recognizable Warner Bros. characters to general audiences. Sculpting was incorporated the most on Bugs and Lola, including in &quot;beauty shots&quot; or sequences where Bugs and Lola are together. Perkins conceived the idea of the villains being secondary colors, as the main Looney Tunes were either primary colors, black, or brown.

There was extensive experimentation with motion blur with the 2D characters, particularly Tweety; as Simon Eves explained, &quot;The workflow was that an artist would track some specific points on the sequence of 2D character-on-black that came from the animation house, and I think it was able to take a basic roto shape as well, and then it would generate an interpolated motion vector field which could be applied as a variable directional blur. The field would deform based on the relative motion of the tracking points on the camera, to produce more accurate blur as the character deformed.&quot;

==Release==

Warner Bros. released &quot;Space Jam&quot; through its Family Entertainment division on November 15, 1996.

===Home media===
Warner Home Video released the film on VHS, DVD, and LaserDisc on March 11, 1997. The VHS tape was reprinted and re-released through Warner Home Video&#x27;s catalog promotions: &quot;The Warner Bros. 75th Anniversary Celebration&quot; (1998), &quot;Century Collection&quot; (1999), &quot;Century 2000&quot; (2000) and &quot;Warner Spotlight&quot; (2001). The film was re-released on DVD on July 25, 2000. On October 28, 2003, the film was once again re-released as a 2-disc, special-edition DVD including newly made extras such as a commentary track, a featurette, production notes, and an hour of previously released &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; shorts and a TV special.

On November 6, 2007, &quot;Space Jam&quot; was featured as one of four films in Warner Home Video&#x27;s 4-Film Favorites: Family Comedies collection DVD (the other three being &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;—which was released seven years after &quot;Space Jam&quot;—&quot;Osmosis Jones&quot; and &quot;Funky Monkey&quot;). On February 8, 2011, the first disc of the previous 2-disc edition was released by itself in a film-only edition DVD and on October 4, the film was released for the first time in widescreen HD on Blu-ray which, save for the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; shorts, ported over all the extras from the 2003 2-disc edition DVD.

A double DVD release, paired with &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;, was released on June 7, 2016. On November 15, 2016, Warner Bros. released another &quot;Space Jam&quot; Blu-ray to commemorate the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary.

On July 6, 2021, the film arrived on Ultra HD Blu-ray to celebrate the 25th anniversary and the release of &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;.

===Other media===
&quot;Space Jam&quot; later expanded into a media franchise which includes comics, video games and merchandise. The &quot;Space Jam&quot; franchise is estimated to have generated in total revenue. This includes a wide variety of merchandise, such as Air Jordans, Bugs Bunny shirts, Happy Meals, Mugsy Bogues jerseys, and Tweety gowns.

The film was adapted into a graphic novel published by DC Comics through their imprint &quot;Warner Bros. Family Entertainment Reading&quot; that published the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, &quot;Animaniacs&quot; and &quot;Pinky &amp; The Brain&quot; monthly comic books. The special issue was written by David Cody Weiss and drawn by Leonardo Batic.

A licensed pinball game by Sega, a video game for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn and MS-DOS by Acclaim, and a handheld LCD game by Tiger Electronics were released based on the film.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Space Jam&quot; grossed $90.5 million in the United States, and in other territories, for a worldwide total of $250.2 million.

Domestically, it debuted to $27.5 million from 2,650 theaters, topping the box office. The film then made $16.2 million in its sophomore weekend but it dropped to second place behind &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; and $13.6 million in its third place behind &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; and &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot;.

In China, the film was released in 1997 and grossed .

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Space Jam&quot; holds an approval rating of 44% based on 87 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;While it&#x27;s no slam dunk, &quot;Space Jam&quot;″s silly, Looney Toons-laden slapstick and vivid animation will leave younger viewers satisfied – though accompanying adults may be more annoyed than entertained.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 59 out of 100 based on 22 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; and &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; both gave &quot;Space Jam&quot; a thumbs up, although Siskel&#x27;s praise was more reserved. In his review, Ebert gave the film three-and a-half stars and noted, &quot;&quot;Space Jam&quot; is a happy marriage of good ideas—three films for the price of one, giving us a comic treatment of the career adventures of Michael Jordan, crossed with a Looney Tunes cartoon and some showbiz warfare. ... the result is delightful, a family movie in the best sense (which means the adults will enjoy it, too).&quot; Siskel focused much of his praise on Jordan&#x27;s performance, saying, &quot;He wisely accepted as a first movie a script that builds nicely on his genial personality in an assortment of TV ads. The sound bites are just a little longer.&quot; Leonard Maltin also gave the film a positive review (three stars), stating that &quot;Jordan is very engaging, the vintage characters perform admirably ... and the computer-generated special effects are a collective knockout.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; praised the film for its humor as well as the Looney Tunes&#x27; antics and Jordan&#x27;s acting.

Although Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized the film&#x27;s animation, she later went on to say that the film is a &quot;fond tribute to [the Looney Tunes characters&#x27;] past.&quot; Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; complained about some aspects of the movie, stating, &quot;...we don&#x27;t get the co-stars&#x27; best stuff. Michael doesn&#x27;t soar enough. The Looney Tunes don&#x27;t pulverize us the way they did when Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng or Bob Clampett were in charge.&quot; Yet overall, he also liked the film, giving it 3 stars and saying: &quot;Is it cute? Yes. Is it a crowd-pleaser? Yup. Is it classic? Nope. (Though it could have been.)&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot; gave the movie only two stars, calling it a &quot;cynical attempt to cash in on the popularity of Warner Bros. cartoon characters and basketball player Michael Jordan, inspired by a Nike commercial.&quot; Margaret A. McGurk of &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; gave the film stars out of four writing, &quot;Technical spectacle amounts to nothing without a good story.&quot;

Veteran &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; director Chuck Jones was critical of the film and its premise, opining that Bugs Bunny would not have enlisted help from others in resolving a conflict.

==Legacy==
===Cultural influence===
The Monstars make a cameo in the &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot; episode &quot;Star Warners&quot;. Jordan, who was a spokesman for MCI Communications before the film was made, would appear with the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters (as his &quot;&quot;Space Jam&quot; buddies&quot;) in several MCI commercials for several years after the film was released before MCI merged with WorldCom and subsequently Verizon Communications. Bugs had previously appeared with Jordan as &quot;Hare Jordan&quot; in Nike ads for the Air Jordan VII and Air Jordan VIII. In the next theatrical Looney Tunes film, &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;, Jordan appears in archive footage from this film as one of the disguises of Mr. Chairman (Steve Martin). In 2013, Yahoo! Screen released a parody of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;30 for 30&quot; about the game shown in the film. The short dates the game as taking place on November 17, 1995, although Jordan&#x27;s real-life return to basketball when it occurred on March 18. In April 2019, the website SBNation ran a mockumentary April Fools Day episode of its popular Rewinder series on Jordan&#x27;s climactic shot. The Nerdlucks appeared in the &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; original film &quot;Teen Titans Go! See Space Jam&quot; which aired on Cartoon Network on June 20, 2021, and was released on digital on July 27, 2021.

The film&#x27;s official website spacejam.com, created in 1996 alongside promotion of the film, remained unchanged but active for 25 years prior to the release of the film&#x27;s sequel, an unusual aspect to film promotion websites. The site was one of the earliest film promotion websites, and included a number of unrefined web design facets, such as heavy use of animated GIFs. While the site&#x27;s content had been moved under Warner Bros.&#x27;s site around 2003, the site&#x27;s design gained a resurgence of interest around 2010 as an historical artifact of the early days of the web, and Warner Bros. returned the site to the spacejam.com address in response. Following the release of &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot; first trailer in April 2021, the website was updated for promotion of the new film, though the 1996 content remained available as a separate landing page.

A television film crossover with &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot;, &quot;Teen Titans Go! See Space Jam&quot;, aired on Cartoon Network in June 2021. The film features the Teen Titans meeting the Nerdlucks and providing humorous commentary over the original film. The movie&#x27;s length is slightly abridged, omitting the opening credits and several scenes that do not feature the Looney Tunes, and the soundtrack is replaced by an original score.

==Sequel==

A sequel to &quot;Space Jam&quot; was planned as early as 1996. As development began, &quot;Space Jam 2&quot; was going to involve a new basketball competition with Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes against a new alien villain named Berserk-O!. Artist Bob Camp was tasked with designing Berserk-O! and his henchmen. Joe Pytka would have returned to direct while Cervone and his creative partner Spike Brandt signed on to direct the animation sequences. However, Jordan did not agree to star in a sequel, and Warner Bros. eventually cancelled plans for &quot;Space Jam 2&quot;.

Several potential sequels, including &quot;Spy Jam&quot; with Jackie Chan that would end up becoming the basis for &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;, &quot;Race Jam&quot; with Jeff Gordon, &quot;Golf Jam&quot; with Tiger Woods, and &quot;Skate Jam&quot; with Tony Hawk were all discussed but never came to be.

In February 2014, Warner Bros. officially announced development of a sequel that will star LeBron James. In July 2015, James and his film studio, SpringHill Entertainment, signed a deal with Warner Bros. for television, film and digital content after receiving positive reviews for his role in &quot;Trainwreck.&quot; By 2016, Justin Lin signed onto the project as director, and co-screenwriter with Andrew Dodge and Alfredo Botello. By August 2018, Lin left the project, and Terence Nance was hired to direct the film. In September 2018, Ryan Coogler was announced as a producer for the film. Filming would take place in California and within a 30-mile radius of Los Angeles. Prior to production, the film received $21.8 million in tax credits as a result of a new tax incentive program from the state.

In February 2019, after releasing the official logo with a promotional poster, &quot;Space Jam 2&quot; was announced to be scheduled for release on July 16, 2021. Principal photography began on June 25, 2019. On March 4, 2021, it was confirmed that the sequel would also feature various characters in the Warner Bros. film and television archive.

Jordan was reportedly set to make a cameo in &quot;Space Jam 2&quot;, as the makers teased the fans in June 2021 that &quot;Jordan will appear in the film, but not in the way you would expect it.&quot; In fact, as shown in the film, he appeared in various pictures from his career and the &quot;Space Jam&quot; film. In a scene, Sylvester claimed to have found Jordan, but he actually found actor Michael B. Jordan, who thus made the cameo expected to be made by the former Bulls star.

After the release of &quot;Space Jam 2&quot;, a third film was in talks by director Malcolm D. Lee with Dwayne Johnson involved as the lead, transitioning on the sports genre from basketball to professional wrestling.

<text>Athos C.&quot;Ace&quot;Brigode (January 5, 1893 – February 3, 1960) was a United States dance band leader who enjoyed his greatest popularity in the 1920s.

Ace Brigode was born in Illinois. He entered show business as a member of a touring minstrel show. His band began playing professionally in early 1921 as &quot;Ace Brigode &amp; His 10 Virginians&quot;; a bit later they were renamed &quot;Ace Brigode &amp; His 14 Virginians&quot;; this name stuck although the band varied between having 9 to 19 members over the years. The band played in the moderately jazz-influenced peppy dance band style called &quot;Collegiate Hot&quot; that to many people exemplifies the music of the &quot;Roaring Twenties&quot;. The most noted musician who played with Brigode was trombonist Abe Lincoln.

Brigode hosted the &quot;White Rose Gasoline Show&quot; on radio, featuring his band. The band also made gramophone records for various record labels, including OKeh, Edison, Cameo and Pathé Records; their biggest hit was a 1925 version of &quot;Yes Sir, That&#x27;s My Baby&quot; for Columbia Records. The band&#x27;s theme song was &quot;Carry Me Back to Old Virginny&quot;. Dwight Eisenhower was among the band&#x27;s fans.

Brigode himself played violin and clarinet, but mostly acted as master of ceremonies. The band toured widely around the United States. Brigode kept the band current with newer style arrangements into the early swing music era, before disbanding the group in 1946.

After this Ace Brigode worked as promotions manager for Cleveland, Ohio&#x27;s Chippewa Lake Park, and also did television commercial voice work. Brigode refused to book rock and roll performers into the park because of his dislike for the musical genre. He was survived by his wife, Theresa, sons Robert and Richard, and a daughter, Mrs. James Knott.

<text>A propellant (or propellent) is a mass that is expelled or expanded in such a way as to create a thrust or another motive force in accordance with Newton&#x27;s third law of motion, and &quot;propel&quot; a vehicle, projectile, or fluid payload. In vehicles, the engine that expels the propellant is called a reaction engine. Although technically a propellant is the reaction mass used to create thrust, the term &quot;propellant&quot; is often used to describe a substance which contains both the reaction mass and the fuel that holds the energy used to accelerate the reaction mass. For example, the term &quot;propellant&quot; is often used in chemical rocket design to describe a combined fuel/propellant, although the propellants should not be confused with the fuel that is used by an engine to produce the energy that expels the propellant. Even though the byproducts of substances used as fuel are also often used as a reaction mass to create the thrust, such as with a chemical rocket engine, propellant and fuel are two distinct concepts.

Vehicles can use propellants to move by ejecting a propellant backwards which creates an opposite force that moves the vehicle forward. Projectiles can use propellants that are expanding gases which provide the motive force to set the projectile in motion. Aerosol cans use propellants which are fluids that are compressed so that when the propellant is allowed to escape by releasing a valve, the energy stored by the compression moves the propellant out of the can and that propellant forces the aerosol payload out along with the propellant. Compressed fluid may also be used as a simple vehicle propellant, with the potential energy that is stored in the compressed fluid used to expel the fluid as the propellant. The energy stored in the fluid was added to the system when the fluid was compressed, such as compressed air. The energy applied to the pump or thermal system that is used to compress the air is stored until it is released by allowing the propellant to escape. Compressed fluid may also be used only as energy storage along with some other substance as the propellant, such as with a water rocket, where the energy stored in the compressed air is the fuel and the water is the propellant.

In electrically powered spacecraft, electricity is used to accelerate the propellant. An electrostatic force may be used to expel positive ions, or the Lorentz force may be used to expel negative ions and electrons as the propellant. Electrothermal engines use the electromagnetic force to heat low molecular weight gases (e.g. hydrogen, helium, ammonia) into a plasma and expel the plasma as propellant. In the case of a resistojet rocket engine, the compressed propellant is simply heated using resistive heating as it is expelled to create more thrust.

In chemical rockets and aircraft, fuels are used to produce an energetic gas that can be directed through a nozzle, thereby producing thrust. In rockets, the burning of rocket fuel produces an exhaust, and the exhausted material is usually expelled as a propellant under pressure through a nozzle. The exhaust material may be a gas, liquid, plasma, or a solid. In powered aircraft without propellers such as jets, the propellant is usually the product of the burning of fuel with atmospheric oxygen so that the resulting propellant product has more mass than the fuel carried on the vehicle.

Proposed photon rockets would use the relativistic momentum of photons to create thrust. Even though photons do not have mass, they can still act as a propellant because they move at relativistic speed, i.e., the speed of light. In this case Newton&#x27;s third Law of Motion is inadequate to model the physics involved and relativistic physics must be used.

In chemical rockets, chemical reactions are used to produce energy which creates movement of a fluid which is used to expel the products of that chemical reaction (and sometimes other substances) as propellants. For example, in a simple hydrogen/oxygen engine, hydrogen is burned (oxidized) to create and the energy from the chemical reaction is used to expel the water (steam) to provide thrust. Often in chemical rocket engines, a higher molecular mass substance is included in the fuel to provide more reaction mass.

Rocket propellant may be expelled through an expansion nozzle as a cold gas, that is, without energetic mixing and combustion, to provide small changes in velocity to spacecraft by the use of cold gas thrusters, usually as maneuvering thrusters.

To attain a useful density for storage, most propellants are stored as either a solid or a liquid.

==Vehicle propellants==
A rocket propellant is a mass that is expelled from a vehicle, such as a rocket, in such a way as to create a thrust in accordance with Newton&#x27;s third law of motion, and &quot;propel&quot; the vehicle forward. The engine that expels the propellant is called a reaction engine. Although the term &quot;propellant&quot; is often used in chemical rocket design to describe a combined fuel/propellant, propellants should not be confused with the fuel that is used by an engine to produce the energy that expels the propellant. Even though the byproducts of substances used as fuel are also often used as a reaction mass to create the thrust, such as with a chemical rocket engine, propellant and fuel are two distinct concepts.

In electrically powered spacecraft, electricity is used to accelerate the propellant. An electrostatic force may be used to expel positive ions, or the Lorentz force may be used to expel negative ions and electrons as the propellant. Electrothermal engines use the electromagnetic force to heat low molecular weight gases (e.g. hydrogen, helium, ammonia) into a plasma and expel the plasma as propellant.

In powered aircraft without propellers such as jets, the propellant is usually the product of the burning of fuel with atmospheric oxygen so that the resulting propellant product has more mass than the fuel carried on the vehicle.

The propellant or fuel may also simply be a compressed fluid, with the potential energy that is stored in the compressed fluid used to expel the fluid as the propellant. The energy stored in the fluid was added to the system when the fluid was compressed, such as compressed air. The energy applied to the pump or thermal system that is used to compress the air is stored until it is released by allowing the propellant to escape.

To attain a useful density for storage, most propellants are stored as either a solid or a liquid.

Propellants may be energized by chemical reactions to expel solid, liquid or gas. Electrical energy may be used to expel gases, plasmas, ions, solids or liquids. Photons may be used to provide thrust via relativistic momentum.

===Chemically powered===
====Solid propellant====

* Composite propellants made from a solid oxidizer such as ammonium perchlorate or ammonium nitrate, a synthetic rubber such as HTPB, PBAN, or Polyurethane (or energetic polymers such as polyglycidyl nitrate or polyvinyl nitrate for extra energy), optional high-explosive fuels (again, for extra energy) such as RDX or nitroglycerin, and usually a powdered metal fuel such as aluminum.
* Some amateur propellants use potassium nitrate, combined with sugar, epoxy, or other fuels and binder compounds.
* Potassium perchlorate has been used as an oxidizer, paired with asphalt, epoxy, and other binders.

Propellants that explode in operation are of little practical use currently, although there have been experiments with Pulse Detonation Engines. Also the newly synthesized bishomocubane based compounds are under consideration in the research stage as both solid and liquid propellants of the future.

=====Grain=====
Solid fuel/propellants are used in forms called grains. A grain is any individual particle of fuel/propellant regardless of the size or shape. The shape and size of a grain determines the burn time, amount of gas, and rate of produced energy from the burning of the fuel and, as a consequence, thrust vs time profile.

There are three types of burns that can be achieved with different grains.
; Progressive burn: Usually a grain with multiple perforations or a star cut in the center providing a lot of surface area.
; Degressive burn: Usually a solid grain in the shape of a cylinder or sphere.
; Neutral burn: Usually a single perforation; as outside surface decreases the inside surface increases at the same rate.

=====Composition=====
There are four different types of solid fuel/propellant compositions:
; Single-based fuel/propellant: A single based fuel/propellant has nitrocellulose as its chief explosives ingredient. Stabilizers and other additives are used to control the chemical stability and enhance its properties.
; Double-based fuel/propellant: Double-based fuel/propellants consist of nitrocellulose with nitroglycerin or other liquid organic nitrate explosives added. Stabilizers and other additives are also used. Nitroglycerin reduces smoke and increases the energy output. Double-based fuel/propellants are used in small arms, cannons, mortars and rockets.
; Triple-based fuel/propellant: Triple-based fuel/propellants consist of nitrocellulose, nitroguanidine, nitroglycerin or other liquid organic nitrate explosives. Triple-based fuel/propellants are used in cannons.
; Composite: Composites do not utilize nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin, nitroguanidine or any other organic nitrate as the primary constituent. Composites usually consist of a fuel such as metallic aluminum, a combustible binder such as synthetic rubber or HTPB, and an oxidizer such as ammonium perchlorate. Composite fuel/propellants are used in large rocket motors. In some applications, such as the US SLBM Trident II missile, nitroglycerin is added to the aluminum and ammonium perchlorate composite as an energetic plasticizer.

====Liquid propellant====

In rockets, three main liquid bipropellant combinations are used: cryogenic oxygen and hydrogen, cryogenic oxygen and a hydrocarbon, and storable propellants.
; Cryogenic oxygen-hydrogen combination system: Used in upper stages and sometimes in booster stages of space launch systems. This is a nontoxic combination. This gives high specific impulse and is ideal for high-velocity missions.
; Cryogenic oxygen-hydrocarbon propellant system: Used for many booster stages of space launch vehicles as well as a smaller number of second stages. This combination of fuel/oxidizer has high density and hence allows for a more compact booster design.
; Storable propellant combinations: Used in almost all bipropellant low-thrust, auxiliary or reaction control rocket engines, as well as in some in large rocket engines for first and second stages of ballistic missiles. They are instant-starting and suitable for long-term storage.

Propellant combinations used for liquid propellant rockets include:
* Liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen
* Liquid oxygen and kerosene or RP-1
* Liquid oxygen and ethanol
* Liquid oxygen and methane
* Hydrogen peroxide and mentioned above alcohol or RP-1
* Red fuming nitric acid (RFNA) and kerosene or RP-1
* RFNA and Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH)
* Dinitrogen tetroxide and UDMH, MMH, and/or hydrazine

Common monopropellant used for liquid rocket engines include:
* Hydrogen peroxide
* Hydrazine
* Red fuming nitric acid (RFNA)

===Electrically powered===
Electrically powered reactive engines use a variety of usually ionized propellants, including atomic ions, plasma, electrons, or small droplets or solid particles as propellant.

====Electrostatic====

If the acceleration is caused mainly by the Coulomb force (i.e. application of a static electric field in the direction of the acceleration) the device is considered electrostatic. The types of electrostatic drives and their propellants:
* Gridded ion thruster – using positive ions as the propellant, accelerated by an electrically charged grid
** NASA Solar Technology Application Readiness (NSTAR) – positive ions accelerated using high-voltage electrodes
** HiPEP – using positive ions as the propellant, created using microwaves
** Radiofrequency ion thruster – generalization of HiPEP
* Hall-effect thruster, including its subtypes Stationary Plasma Thruster (SPT) and Thruster with Anode Layer (TAL) – use the Hall effect to orient electrons to create positive ions for propellant
* Colloid ion thruster – electrostatic acceleration of droplets of liquid salt as the propellant
* Field-emission electric propulsion – using electrodes to accelerate ionized liquid metal as a propellant
* Nano-particle field extraction thruster – using charged cylindrical carbon nanotubes as propellant

====Electrothermal====
These are engines that use electromagnetic fields to generate a plasma which is used as the propellant. They use a nozzle to direct the energized propellant. The nozzle itself may be composed simply of a magnetic field. Low molecular weight gases (e.g. hydrogen, helium, ammonia) are preferred propellants for this kind of system.
* Resistojet – using a usually inert compressed propellant that is energized by simple resistive heating
* Arcjet – uses (usually) hydrazine or ammonia as a propellant which is energized with an electrical arc
* Microwave – a type of Radiofrequency ion thruster
* Variable specific impulse magnetoplasma rocket (VASIMR) – using microwave-generated plasma as the propellant and magnetic field to direct its expulsion

====Electromagnetic====

Electromagnetic thrusters use ions as the propellant, which are accelerated by the Lorentz force or by magnetic fields, either of which is generated by electricity:
* Electrodeless plasma thruster – a complex system that uses cold plasma as a propellant that is accelerated by ponderomotive force
* Magnetoplasmadynamic thruster – propellants include xenon, neon, argon, hydrogen, hydrazine, or lithium; expelled using the Lorentz force
* Pulsed inductive thruster – because this reactive engine uses a radial magnetic field, it acts on both positive and negative particles and so it may use a wide range of gases as a propellant including water, hydrazine, ammonia, argon, xenon and many others
* Pulsed plasma thruster – uses a Teflon plasma as a propellant, which is created by an electrical arc and expelled using the Lorentz force
* Helicon Double Layer Thruster – a plasma propellant is generated and excited from a gas using a helicon induced by high frequency band radiowaves which form a magnetic nozzle in a cylinder

===Nuclear===
Nuclear reactions may be used to produce the energy for the expulsion of the propellants. Many types of nuclear reactors have been used/proposed to produce electricity for electrical propulsion as outlined above. Nuclear pulse propulsion uses a series of nuclear explosions to create large amounts of energy to expel the products of the nuclear reaction as the propellant. Nuclear thermal rockets use the heat of a nuclear reaction to heat a propellant. Usually the propellant is hydrogen because the force is a function of the energy irrespective of the mass of the propellant, so the lightest propellant (hydrogen) produces the greatest specific impulse.

===Photonic===

A photonic reactive engine uses photons as the propellant and their discrete relativistic energy to produce thrust.

==Compressed fluid propellants==
&quot;Compressed fluid&quot; or &quot;compressed gas&quot; propellants are pressurized physically, by a compressor, rather than by a chemical reaction. The pressures and energy densities that can be achieved, while insufficient for high-performance rocketry and firearms, are adequate for most applications, in which case compressed fluids offer a simpler, safer, and more practical source of propellant pressure.

A compressed fluid propellant may simply be a pressurized gas, or a substance which is a gas at atmospheric pressure, but stored under pressure as a liquid.

===Compressed gas propellants===
In applications in which a large quantity of propellant is used, such as pressure washing and airbrushing, air may be pressurized by a compressor and used immediately. Additionally, a hand pump to compress air can be used for its simplicity in low-tech applications such as atomizers, plant misters and water rockets. The simplest examples of such a system are squeeze bottles for such liquids as ketchup and shampoo.

However, compressed gases are impractical as stored propellants if they do not liquify inside the storage container, because very high pressures are required in order to store any significant quantity of gas, and high-pressure gas cylinders and pressure regulators are expensive and heavy.

===Liquified gas propellants===
====Principle====
Liquefied gas propellants are gases at atmospheric pressure, but become liquid at a modest pressure. This pressure is high enough to provide useful propulsion of the payload (e.g. aerosol paint, deodorant, lubricant), but is low enough to be stored in an inexpensive metal can, and to not pose a safety hazard in case the can is ruptured.

The mixture of liquid and gaseous propellant inside the can maintains a constant pressure, called the liquid&#x27;s vapor pressure. As the payload is depleted, the propellant vaporizes to fill the internal volume of the can. Liquids are typically 500-1000x denser than their corresponding gases at atmospheric pressure; even at the higher pressure inside the can, only a small fraction of its volume needs to be propellant in order to eject the payload and replace it with vapor.

Vaporizing the liquid propellant to gas requires some energy, the enthalpy of vaporization, which cools the system. This is usually insignificant, although it can sometimes be an unwanted effect of heavy usage (as the system cools, the vapor pressure of the propellant drops). However, in the case of a freeze spray, this cooling contributes to the desired effect (although freeze sprays may also contain other components, such as chloroethane, with a lower vapor pressure but higher enthalpy of vaporization than the propellant).

====Propellant compounds====
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were once often used as propellants, but since the Montreal Protocol came into force in 1989, they have been replaced in nearly every country due to the negative effects CFCs have on Earth&#x27;s ozone layer. The most common replacements of CFCs are mixtures of volatile hydrocarbons, typically propane, n-butane and isobutane. Dimethyl ether (DME) and methyl ethyl ether are also used. All these have the disadvantage of being flammable. Nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide are also used as propellants to deliver foodstuffs (for example, whipped cream and cooking spray). Medicinal aerosols such as asthma inhalers use hydrofluoroalkanes (HFA): either HFA 134a (1,1,1,2,-tetrafluoroethane) or HFA 227 (1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane) or combinations of the two. More recently, liquid hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) propellants have become more widely adopted in aerosol systems due to their relatively low vapor pressure, low global warming potential (GWP), and nonflammability.

====Payloads====
The practicality of liquified gas propellants allows for a broad variety of payloads. Aerosol sprays, in which a liquid is ejected as a spray, include paints, lubricants, degreasers, and protective coatings; deodorants and other personal care products; cooking oils. Some liquid payloads are not sprayed due to lower propellant pressure and/or viscous payload, as with whipped cream and shaving cream or shaving gel. Low-power guns, such as BB guns, paintball guns, and airsoft guns, have solid projectile payloads. Uniquely, in the case of a gas duster (&quot;canned air&quot;), the only payload is the velocity of the propellant vapor itself.

<text>Gremory (also &quot;Gremory&quot;, &quot;Gamori&quot;, &quot;Gaeneron&quot;, &quot;Gemon&quot;, &quot;Gemyem&quot;) is a demon listed in demonological grimoires.

== Description ==
Gremory is described in demonological works such as the Munich Manual of Demonic Magic
 the &quot;Liber Officiorum Spirituum&quot; the &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot;, the &quot;Lesser Key of Solomon&quot;, the &quot;Dictionnaire Infernal&quot;, as appearing in the form of a beautiful woman (though as with all Goetic demons referred to using the masculine pronouns &quot;he&quot; and &quot;his&quot;) wearing a duchess&#x27;s crown and riding a camel, ascribed with the power of revealing hidden treasures and answering questions about the past, present, and future. The Munich Manual, &quot;Pseudomonarchia&quot;, &quot;Lesser Key&quot;, and &quot;Dictionnaire&quot; further give Gremory the power of procuring love from women (although the &quot;Liber Officiorum Spirituum&quot; describes her as &quot;a companion of the love of women, and especially of maidens&quot;), while the &quot;Pseudomonarchia&quot; and the &quot;Lesser Key&quot; note that the duchess&#x27;s crown is (somehow) worn on Gremory&#x27;s waist. Stephen Skinner and David Rankine, in their edition of &quot;The Goetia of Dr Rudd&quot;, suggest that this was a mistranslation of the Latin &quot;cingitur&quot; which should have been translated &quot;encircling her head&quot;.

Gremory is mentioned in a manuscript labelled Fasciculus Rerum Geomanticarum.

== Legions and standing ==

In the &quot;Pseudomonarchia&quot;, &quot;Lesser Key&quot;, and &quot;Dictionnaire&quot;, Gremory is ranked as a duke ruling 26 legions of spirits, but (still a duke) ruling 27 in the Munich Manual of Demonic Magic and ruling 5 or 42 legions as either a duke, prince, or captain, in the &quot;Liber Officiorium Spirituum&quot;.

According to Rudd, Gremory is opposed by the Shemhamphorasch angel Poiel.

==In popular culture==
*In manga and anime High School DxD, Gremory is one of the 72 Devil Noble Families of the Ars Goetia. The progenitor of the Gremory Clan, Runeas is regarded as the original Gremory Devil depicted in grimoires, legends and Bible spawned by the Mother of Devils Lilith. The main female protagonist, Rias Gremory is a member of the Gremory family and the love interest of the main protagonist Issei Hyodo.
*In the video game Fire Emblem: Three Houses, Gremory is a master rank class that specializes in healing and dark magic.
*In the Castlevania video game successor &quot;&quot; and its 8-bit spinoffs, one of the main antagonists is named Gremory, a demon associated with the moon.
*In the manga Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans – Gekko, the ASW-G-56, 20.5 meters tall Gundam Gremory was piloted by a female pilot called Deira Nadira, a side character in the manga. A Gundam Frame owned by the Nadira family, one of the prestigious families that assisted Gjallarhorn&#x27;s Seven Stars. The Gundam Gremory&#x27;s most notably feature is that its upper body, including the movable hood that covers its head. It wields an anchor-shaped weapon named the Battle Anchor, but one of its blades was damaged during the Calamity War.

<text>In demonology, Ose (Pronounced /ˈɒze/), is a Great President of Hell, ruling three legions of demons (thirty to other authors, and &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot; gives no number of legions). He makes men wise in all liberal sciences and gives true answers concerning divine and secret things; he also brings insanity to any person the conjurer wishes, making them believe that they are king and wearing a crown, or a Pope. However, his spells only last 1 hour at a time.

Additionally, Ose has the ability to transform people into animals. The victims of the curse will be unaware that they were turned into animals.

Ose is depicted as a leopard that after a while changes into a man.

== Etymology ==
His name seems to derive from Latin &#x27;&#x27;, mouth, language, bone, or &#x27;osor&#x27;, that who abhors.

&quot;Other spellings&quot;: &quot;Osé, Oze, Oso, Voso.&quot;

<text>The partition of India in 1947 was the division of British India into two independent dominion states, the Union of India and Dominion of Pakistan. The Union of India is today the Republic of India and the Dominion of Pakistan, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, and the People&#x27;s Republic of Bangladesh. The partition involved the division of two provinces, Bengal and the Punjab, based on district-wise Hindu or Muslim majorities. It also involved the division of the British Indian Army, the Royal Indian Navy, the Indian Civil Service, the railways, and the central treasury, between the two new dominions. The partition was set forth in the Indian Independence Act 1947 and resulted in the dissolution of the British Raj, or Crown rule in India. The two self-governing countries of India and Pakistan legally came into existence at midnight on 14–15 August 1947.

The partition displaced between 12 and 20 million people along religious lines, creating overwhelming refugee crises in the newly constituted dominions; there was large-scale violence, with estimates of loss of life accompanying or preceding the partition disputed and varying between several hundred thousand and two million. The violent nature of the partition created an atmosphere of hostility and suspicion between India and Pakistan that plagues their relationship to the present.

The term &quot;partition of India&quot; does not cover the secession of Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971, nor the earlier separations of Burma (now Myanmar) and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) from the administration of British India. The term also does not cover the political integration of princely states into the two new dominions, nor the disputes of annexation or division arising in the princely states of Hyderabad, Junagadh, and Jammu and Kashmir, though violence along religious lines did break out in some princely states at the time of the partition. It does not cover the incorporation of the enclaves of French India into India during the period 1947–1954, nor the annexation of Goa and other districts of Portuguese India by India in 1961. Other contemporaneous political entities in the region in 1947, such as Sikkim, Bhutan, Nepal, and the Maldives, were unaffected by the partition.

==Background==
===Pre-World War II (1905–1938)===

====Partition of Bengal: 1905====


In 1905, during his second term as viceroy of India, Lord Curzon divided the Bengal Presidency—the largest administrative subdivision in British India—into the Muslim-majority province of Eastern Bengal and Assam and the Hindu-majority province of Bengal (present-day Indian states of West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, and Odisha). Curzon&#x27;s act, the partition of Bengal—which had been contemplated by various colonial administrations since the time of Lord William Bentinck, though never acted upon—was to transform nationalist politics as nothing else before it.

The Hindu elite of Bengal, many of whom owned land that was leased out to Muslim peasants in East Bengal, protested strongly. The large Bengali-Hindu middle-class (the &quot;Bhadralok&quot;), upset at the prospect of Bengalis being outnumbered in the new Bengal province by Biharis and Oriyas, felt that Curzon&#x27;s act was punishment for their political assertiveness. The pervasive protests against Curzon&#x27;s decision predominantly took the form of the &quot;Swadeshi&quot; (&#x27;buy Indian&#x27;) campaign, involving a boycott of British goods. Sporadically, but flagrantly, the protesters also took to political violence, which involved attacks on civilians. The violence was ineffective, as most planned attacks were either prevented by the British or failed. The rallying cry for both types of protest was the slogan &quot;Bande Mataram&quot; (Bengali, ), the title of a song by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, which invoked a mother goddess, who stood variously for Bengal, India, and the Hindu goddess Kali. The unrest spread from Calcutta to the surrounding regions of Bengal when Calcutta&#x27;s English-educated students returned home to their villages and towns. The religious stirrings of the slogan and the political outrage over the partition were combined as young men, in such groups as Jugantar, took to bombing public buildings, staging armed robberies, and assassinating British officials. Since Calcutta was the imperial capital, both the outrage and the slogan soon became known nationally.

The overwhelming, predominantly-Hindu protest against the partition of Bengal, along with the fear of reforms favouring the Hindu majority, led the Muslim elite of India in 1906 to the new viceroy Lord Minto, asking for separate electorates for Muslims. In conjunction, they demanded representation in proportion to their share of the total population, reflecting both their status as former rulers and their record of cooperating with the British. This would result in the founding of the All-India Muslim League in Dacca in December 1906. Although Curzon by now had returned to England following his resignation over a dispute with his military chief, Lord Kitchener, the League was in favor of his partition plan. The Muslim elite&#x27;s position, which was reflected in the League&#x27;s position, had crystallized gradually over the previous three decades, beginning with the 1871 Census of British India, which had first estimated the populations in regions of Muslim majority. For his part, Curzon&#x27;s desire to court the Muslims of East Bengal had arisen from British anxieties ever since the 1871 census, and in light of the history of Muslims fighting them in the 1857 Rebellion and the Second Anglo-Afghan War.

In the three decades since the 1871 census, Muslim leaders across North India had intermittently experienced public animosity from some of the new Hindu political and social groups. The Arya Samaj, for example, had not only supported the cow protection movement in their agitation, but also—distraught at the census&#x27; Muslim numbers—organized &quot;reconversion&quot; events for the purpose of welcoming Muslims back to the Hindu fold. In the United Provinces, Muslims became anxious in the late-19th century as Hindu political representation increased, and Hindus were politically mobilized in the Hindi–Urdu controversy and the anti-cow-killing riots of 1893. In 1905, Muslim fears grew when Tilak and Lajpat Rai attempted to rise to leadership positions in the Congress, and the Congress itself rallied around the symbolism of Kali. It was not lost on many Muslims, for example, that the &quot;bande mataram&quot; rallying cry had first appeared in the novel &quot;Anandmath&quot; in which Hindus had battled their Muslim oppressors. Lastly, the Muslim elite, including Nawab of Dacca, Khwaja Salimullah, who hosted the League&#x27;s first meeting in his mansion in Shahbag, were aware that a new province with a Muslim majority would directly benefit Muslims aspiring to political power.

====World War I, Lucknow Pact: 1914–1918====


World War I would prove to be a watershed in the imperial relationship between Britain and India. 1.4 million Indian and British soldiers of the British Indian Army would take part in the war, and their participation would have a wider cultural fallout: news of Indian soldiers fighting and dying with British soldiers, as well as soldiers from dominions like Canada and Australia, would travel to distant corners of the world both in newsprint and by the new medium of the radio. India&#x27;s international profile would thereby rise and would continue to rise during the 1920s. It was to lead, among other things, to India, under its name, becoming a founding member of the League of Nations in 1920 and participating, under the name, &quot;Les Indes Anglaises&quot; (British India), in the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp. Back in India, especially among the leaders of the Indian National Congress, it would lead to calls for greater self-government for Indians.

The 1916 Lucknow Session of the Congress was also the venue of an unanticipated mutual effort by the Congress and the Muslim League, the occasion for which was provided by the wartime partnership between Germany and Turkey. Since the Ottoman Sultan, also held guardianship of the Islamic holy sites of Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem, and, since the British and their allies were now in conflict with the Ottoman Empire, doubts began to increase among some Indian Muslims about the &quot;religious neutrality&quot; of the British, doubts that had already surfaced as a result of the reunification of Bengal in 1911, a decision that was seen as ill-disposed to Muslims. In the Lucknow Pact, the League joined the Congress in the proposal for greater self-government that was campaigned for by Tilak and his supporters; in return, the Congress accepted separate electorates for Muslims in the provincial legislatures as well as the Imperial Legislative Council. In 1916, the Muslim League had anywhere between 500 and 800 members and did not yet have its wider following among Indian Muslims of later years; in the League itself, the pact did not have unanimous backing, having largely been negotiated by a group of &quot;Young Party&quot; Muslims from the United Provinces (UP), most prominently, the brothers Mohammad and Shaukat Ali, who had embraced the Pan-Islamic cause. It gained the support of a young lawyer from Bombay, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who later rose to leadership roles in the League and the Indian independence movement. In later years, as the full ramifications of the pact unfolded, it was seen as benefiting the Muslim minority elites of provinces like UP and Bihar more than the Muslim majorities of Punjab and Bengal. At the time, the &quot;Lucknow Pact&quot; was an important milestone in nationalistic agitation and was seen so by the British.

====Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms: 1919====
Secretary of State for India Montagu and Viceroy Lord Chelmsford presented a report in July 1918 after a long fact-finding trip through India the previous winter. After more discussion by the government and parliament in Britain, and another tour by the Franchise and Functions Committee to identify who among the Indian population could vote in future elections, the Government of India Act of 1919 (also known as the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms) was passed in December 1919. The new Act enlarged both the provincial and Imperial legislative councils and repealed the Government of India&#x27;s recourse to the &quot;official majority&quot; in unfavourable votes. Although departments like defence, foreign affairs, criminal law, communications, and income-tax were retained by the viceroy and the central government in New Delhi, other departments like public health, education, land-revenue, local self-government were transferred to the provinces. The provinces themselves were now to be administered under a new dyarchical system, whereby some areas like education, agriculture, infrastructure development, and local self-government became the preserve of Indian ministers and legislatures, and ultimately the Indian electorates, while others like irrigation, land-revenue, police, prisons, and control of media remained within the purview of the British governor and his executive council. The new Act also made it easier for Indians to be admitted into the civil service and the army officer corps.

A greater number of Indians were now enfranchised, although, for voting at the national level, they constituted only 10% of the total adult male population, many of whom were still illiterate. In the provincial legislatures, the British continued to exercise some control by setting aside seats for special interests they considered cooperative or useful. In particular, rural candidates, generally sympathetic to British rule and less confrontational, were assigned more seats than their urban counterparts. Seats were also reserved for non-Brahmins, landowners, businessmen, and college graduates. The principle of &quot;communal representation&quot;, an integral part of the Minto–Morley Reforms, and more recently of the Congress-Muslim League Lucknow Pact, was reaffirmed, with seats being reserved for Muslims, Sikhs, Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians, and domiciled Europeans, in both provincial and imperial legislative councils. The Montagu–Chelmsford reforms offered Indians the most significant opportunity yet for exercising legislative power, especially at the provincial level, though restricted by the still limited number of eligible voters, by the small budgets available to provincial legislatures, and by the presence of rural and special interest seats that were seen as instruments of British control.

====Introduction of the two-nation theory: 1920s====
The &quot;two-nation theory&quot; is the assertion, based on the former Indian Muslim ruling class&#x27; sense of being culturally and historically distinct, that Indian Hindus and Muslims are two distinct nations. It argued that religion resulted in cultural and social differences between Muslims and Hindus. While some professional Muslim Indian politicians used it to secure or safeguard a large share of political spoils for the Indian Muslims with the withdrawal of British rule, others believed the main political objective was the preservation of the cultural entity of Muslim India. The two-nation theory was a founding principle of the Pakistan Movement (i.e., the ideology of Pakistan as a Muslim nation-state in South Asia), and the partition of India in 1947.

Theodore Beck, who played a major role in founding of the All-India Muslim League in 1906, was supportive of two-nation theory. Another British official supportive of the theory includes Theodore Morison. Both Beck and Morison believed that parliamentary system of majority rule would be disadvantageous for the Muslims.

Arya Samaj leader Lala Lajpat Rai laid out his own version of two-nation theory in 1924 to form &quot;a clear partition of India into a Muslim India and a non-Muslim India&quot;. Lala believed in partition in response to the riots against Hindus in Kohat, North-West Frontier Province which diminished his faith in Hindu-Muslim unity.

Hindu Mahasabha leader Vinayak Damodar Savarkar&#x27;s Hindutva ideology had embryonic form of a two-nation theory since the 1920s. Savarkar in 1937 during the 19th session of the Hindu Mahasabha in Ahmedabad supported two-nation theory, stating that &quot;there are two nations in the main: the Hindus and the Muslims, in India&quot;.

Muhammad Ali Jinnah undertook the ideology that religion is the determining factor in defining the nationality of Indian Muslims in 1940. He termed it as the awakening of Muslims for the creation of Pakistan. However, Jinnah opposed Partition of Punjab and Bengal, and advocated for the integration of all Punjab and Bengal into Pakistan without the displacement of any of its inhabitants, whether they were Sikhs or Hindus. The theory is also a source of inspiration to several Hindu nationalist organizations, with causes as varied as the redefinition of Indian Muslims as non-Indian foreigners and second-class citizens in India, the expulsion of all Muslims from India, the establishment of a legally Hindu state in India, prohibition of conversions to Islam, and the promotion of conversions or reconversions of Indian Muslims to Hinduism.

There are varying interpretations of the two-nation theory, based on whether the two postulated nationalities can coexist in one territory or not, with radically different implications. One interpretation argued for sovereign autonomy, including the right to secede, for Muslim-majority areas of the Indian subcontinent, but without any transfer of populations (i.e., Hindus and Muslims would continue to live together). A different interpretation contends that Hindus and Muslims constitute &quot;two distinct and frequently antagonistic ways of life and that therefore they cannot coexist in one nation.&quot; In this version, a transfer of populations (i.e., the total removal of Hindus from Muslim-majority areas and the total removal of Muslims from Hindu-majority areas) was a desirable step towards a complete separation of two incompatible nations that &quot;cannot coexist in a harmonious relationship.&quot;

Opposition to the theory has come from two sources. The first is the concept of a single Indian nation, of which Hindus and Muslims are two intertwined communities. This is a founding principle of the modern, officially secular Republic of India. Even after the formation of Pakistan, debates on whether Muslims and Hindus are distinct nationalities or not continued in that country as well. The second source of opposition is the concept that while Indians are not one nation, neither are the Muslims or Hindus of the subcontinent, and it is instead the relatively homogeneous provincial units of the subcontinent which are true nations and deserving of sovereignty; the Baloch have presented this view, along with the Sindhi and Pashtun sub-nationalities of Pakistan and the Assamese and Punjabi sub-nationalities of India.

====Muslim homeland, provincial elections: 1930–1938====


In 1933, Choudhry Rahmat Ali had produced a pamphlet, entitled &quot;Now or Never&quot;, in which the term &quot;Pakistan&quot;, &#x27;land of the pure&#x27;, comprising the Punjab, North West Frontier Province (Afghania), Kashmir, Sindh, and Balochistan, was coined for the first time. It did not attract political attention and, a little later, a Muslim delegation to the Parliamentary Committee on Indian Constitutional Reforms gave short shrift to the idea of Pakistan, calling it &quot;chimerical and impracticable&quot;.

In 1932, British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald accepted Ambedkar&#x27;s demand for the &quot;Depressed Classes&quot; to have separate representation in the central and provincial legislatures. The Muslim League favoured this &quot;communal award&quot; as it had the potential to weaken the Hindu caste leadership. Mahatma Gandhi, who was seen as a leading advocate for Dalit rights, went on a fast to persuade the British to repeal these separate electorates. Ambedkar had to back down when it seemed Gandhi&#x27;s life was threatened.

Two years later, the &quot;Government of India Act 1935&quot; introduced provincial autonomy, increasing the number of voters in India to 35 million. More significantly, law and order issues were for the first time devolved from British authority to provincial governments headed by Indians. This increased Muslim anxieties about eventual Hindu domination. In the 1937 Indian provincial elections, the Muslim League turned out its best performance in Muslim-minority provinces such as the United Provinces, where it won 29 of the 64 reserved Muslim seats. In the Muslim-majority regions of the Punjab and Bengal regional parties outperformed the League. In Punjab, the Unionist Party of Sikandar Hayat Khan, won the elections and formed a government, with the support of the Indian National Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal, which lasted five years. In Bengal, the League had to share power in a coalition headed by A. K. Fazlul Huq, the leader of the Krishak Praja Party.

The Congress, on the other hand, with 716 wins in the total of 1585 provincial assemblies seats, was able to form governments in 7 out of the 11 provinces of British India. In its manifesto, Congress maintained that religious issues were of lesser importance to the masses than economic and social issues. The election revealed that it had contested just 58 out of the total 482 Muslim seats, and of these, it won in only 26. In UP, where the Congress won, it offered to share power with the League on condition that the League stops functioning as a representative only of Muslims, which the League refused. This proved to be a mistake as it alienated Congress further from the Muslim masses. Besides, the new UP provincial administration promulgated cow protection and the use of Hindi. The Muslim elite in UP was further alienated, when they saw chaotic scenes of the new Congress Raj, in which rural people who sometimes turned up in large numbers in government buildings, were indistinguishable from the administrators and the law enforcement personnel.

The Muslim League conducted its investigation into the conditions of Muslims under Congress-governed provinces. The findings of such investigations increased fear among the Muslim masses of future Hindu domination. The view that Muslims would be unfairly treated in an independent India dominated by the Congress was now a part of the public discourse of Muslims.

===During and post-World War II (1939–1947)===
With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Lord Linlithgow, Viceroy of India, declared war on India&#x27;s behalf without consulting Indian leaders, leading the Congress provincial ministries to resign in protest. By contrast the Muslim League, which functioned under state patronage, organized &quot;Deliverance Day&quot; celebrations (from Congress dominance) and supported Britain in the war effort. When Linlithgow met with nationalist leaders, he gave the same status to Jinnah as he did to Gandhi, and, a month later, described the Congress as a &quot;Hindu organization&quot;.

In March 1940, in the League&#x27;s annual three-day session in Lahore, Jinnah gave a two-hour speech in English, in which were laid out the arguments of the two-nation theory, stating, in the words of historians Talbot and Singh, that &quot;Muslims and Hindus...were irreconcilably opposed monolithic religious communities and as such, no settlement could be imposed that did not satisfy the aspirations of the former.&quot; On the last day of its session, the League passed what came to be known as the Lahore Resolution, sometimes also &quot;Pakistan Resolution&quot;, demanding that &quot;the areas in which the Muslims are numerically in the majority as in the north-western and eastern zones of India should be grouped to constitute independent states in which the constituent units shall be autonomous and sovereign.&quot; Though it had been founded more than three decades earlier, the League would gather support among South Asian Muslims only during the Second World War.

====August Offer, Cripps Mission: 1940–1942====
In August 1940, Lord Linlithgow proposed that India be granted dominion status after the war. Having not taken the Pakistan idea seriously, Linlithgow supposed that what Jinnah wanted was a non-federal arrangement without Hindu domination. To allay Muslim fears of Hindu domination, the &quot;August Offer&quot; was accompanied by the promise that a future constitution would consider the views of minorities. Neither the Congress nor the Muslim League were satisfied with the offer, and both rejected it in September. The Congress once again started a program of civil disobedience.

In March 1942, with the Japanese fast moving up the Malayan Peninsula after the Fall of Singapore, and with the Americans supporting independence for India, Winston Churchill, then Britain&#x27;s prime minister, sent Sir Stafford Cripps, leader of the House of Commons, with an offer of dominion status to India at the end of the war in return for the Congress&#x27;s support for the war effort. Not wishing to lose the support of the allies they had already secured—the Muslim League, Unionists of Punjab, and the princes—Cripps&#x27;s offer included a clause stating that no part of the British Indian Empire would be forced to join the post-war dominion. The League rejected the offer, seeing this clause as insufficient in meeting the principle of Pakistan. As a result of that proviso, the proposals were also rejected by the Congress, which, since its founding as a polite group of lawyers in 1885, saw itself as the representative of all Indians of all faiths. After the arrival in 1920 of Gandhi, the pre-eminent strategist of Indian nationalism, the Congress had been transformed into a mass nationalist movement of millions.

====Quit India Resolution: August 1942====
In August 1942, Congress launched the Quit India Resolution, asking for drastic constitutional changes which the British saw as the most serious threat to their rule since the Indian rebellion of 1857. With their resources and attention already spread thin by a global war, the nervous British immediately jailed the Congress leaders and kept them in jail until August 1945, whereas the Muslim League was now free for the next three years to spread its message. Consequently, the Muslim League&#x27;s ranks surged during the war, with Jinnah himself admitting, &quot;The war which nobody welcomed proved to be a blessing in disguise.&quot; Although there were other important national Muslim politicians such as Congress leader Abul Kalam Azad, and influential regional Muslim politicians such as A. K. Fazlul Huq of the leftist Krishak Praja Party in Bengal, Sikander Hyat Khan of the landlord-dominated Punjab Unionist Party, and Abd al-Ghaffar Khan of the pro-Congress Khudai Khidmatgar (popularly, &quot;red shirts&quot;) in the North West Frontier Province, the British were to increasingly see the League as the main representative of Muslim India. The Muslim League&#x27;s demand for Pakistan pitted it against the British and Congress.

====Labour victory in the UK election, decision to decolonize: 1945====
The 1945 United Kingdom general election was won by the Labour Party. A government headed by Clement Attlee, with Stafford Cripps and Lord Pethick-Lawrence in the Cabinet, was sworn in. Many in the new government, including Attlee, had a long history of supporting the decolonization of India. The government&#x27;s exchequer had been exhausted by the Second World War and the British public did not appear to be enthusiastic about costly distant involvements. Late in 1945, the British government decided to end British Raj in India, and in early 1947 Britain announced its intention of transferring power no later than June 1948. Attlee wrote later in a memoir that he moved quickly to restart the self-rule process because he expected colonial rule in Asia to meet renewed opposition after the war from both nationalist movements and the United States, while his exchequer feared that post-war Britain could no longer afford to garrison an expansive empire.

====Indian provincial elections: 1946====
Labour Prime Minister Clement Attlee had been deeply interested in Indian independence since the 1920s, being surrounded by Labour statesmen who were affiliated with Krishna Menon and the India League, and for years had supported it. He now took charge of the government position and gave the issue the highest priority. A Cabinet Mission was sent to India led by the Secretary of State for India, Lord Pethick Lawrence, which also included Sir Stafford Cripps, who had visited India four years before. The objective of the mission was to arrange for an orderly transfer to independence. In February 1946, mutinies broke out in the armed services, starting with RAF servicemen frustrated with their slow repatriation to Britain. These mutinies failed to turn into revolutions as the mutineers surrendered after the Congress and the Muslim League convinced the mutineers that they won&#x27;t get victimised.

In early 1946, new elections were held in India. This coincided with the infamous trial of three senior officers—Shah Nawaz Khan, Prem Sahgal, and Gurubaksh Singh Dhillon—of Subhas Chandra Bose&#x27;s defeated Indian National Army (INA) who stood accused of treason. Now as the trials began, the Congress leadership, although having never supported the INA, chose to defend the accused officers and successfully rescued the INA members.

British rule had lost its legitimacy for most Hindus, and conclusive proof of this came in the form of the 1946 elections with the Congress winning 91 percent of the vote among non-Muslim constituencies, thereby gaining a majority in the Central Legislature and forming governments in eight provinces, and becoming the legitimate successor to the British government for most Hindus. If the British intended to stay in India the acquiescence of politically active Indians to British rule would have been in doubt after these election results, although many rural Indians may still have acquiesced to British rule at this time. The Muslim League won the majority of the Muslim vote as well as most reserved Muslim seats in the provincial assemblies, and it also secured all the Muslim seats in the Central Assembly.
====Cabinet Mission: July 1946====
Recovering from its performance in the 1937 elections, the Muslim League was finally able to make good on the claim that it and Jinnah alone represented India&#x27;s Muslims and Jinnah quickly interpreted this vote as a popular demand for a separate homeland. Tensions heightened while the Muslim League was unable to form ministries outside the two provinces of Sind and Bengal, with the Congress forming a ministry in the NWFP and the key Punjab province coming under a coalition ministry of the Congress, Sikhs and Unionists.

The British, while not approving of a separate Muslim homeland, appreciated the simplicity of a single voice to speak on behalf of India&#x27;s Muslims. Britain had wanted India and its army to remain united to keep India in its system of &#x27;imperial defense&#x27;. With India&#x27;s two political parties unable to agree, Britain devised the &quot;Cabinet Mission Plan&quot;. Through this mission, Britain hoped to preserve the united India which they and the Congress desired, while concurrently securing the essence of Jinnah&#x27;s demand for a Pakistan through &#x27;groupings.&#x27; The Cabinet mission scheme encapsulated a federal arrangement consisting of three groups of provinces. Two of these groupings would consist of predominantly Muslim provinces, while the third grouping would be made up of the predominantly Hindu regions. The provinces would be autonomous, but the centre would retain control over the defence, foreign affairs, and communications. Though the proposals did not offer independent Pakistan, the Muslim League accepted the proposals. Even though the unity of India would have been preserved, the Congress leaders, especially Nehru, believed it would leave the Center weak. On 10 July 1946, Nehru gave a &quot;provocative speech,&quot; rejected the idea of grouping the provinces and &quot;effectively torpedoed&quot; both the Cabinet mission plan and the prospect of a United India.

====Direct Action Day: August 1946====
After the Cabinet Mission broke down, in July 1946, Jinnah held a press conference at his home in Bombay. He proclaimed that the Muslim League was &quot;preparing to launch a struggle&quot; and that they &quot;have chalked out a plan&quot;. He said that if the Muslims were not granted a separate Pakistan then they would launch &quot;direct action&quot;. When asked to be specific, Jinnah retorted: &quot;Go to the Congress and ask them their plans. When they take you into their confidence I will take you into mine. Why do you expect me alone to sit with folded hands? I also am going to make trouble.&quot;

The next day, Jinnah announced 16 August 1946 would be &quot;Direct Action Day&quot; and warned Congress, &quot;We do not want war. If you want war we accept your offer unhesitatingly. We will either have a divided India or a destroyed India.&quot;

On that morning, armed Muslim gangs gathered at the Ochterlony Monument in Calcutta to hear Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, the League&#x27;s Chief Minister of Bengal, who, in the words of historian Yasmin Khan, &quot;if he did not explicitly incite violence certainly gave the crowd the impression that they could act with impunity, that neither the police nor the military would be called out and that the ministry would turn a blind eye to any action they unleashed in the city.&quot; That very evening, in Calcutta, Hindus were attacked by returning Muslim celebrants, who carried pamphlets distributed earlier which showed a clear connection between violence and the demand for Pakistan, and directly implicated the celebration of Direct Action Day with the outbreak of the cycle of violence that would later be called the &quot;Great Calcutta Killing of August 1946&quot;. The next day, Hindus struck back, and the violence continued for three days in which approximately 4,000 people died (according to official accounts), both Hindus and Muslims. Although India had outbreaks of religious violence between Hindus and Muslims before, the Calcutta killings were the first to display elements of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;. Violence was not confined to the public sphere, but homes were entered and destroyed, and women and children were attacked. Although the Government of India and the Congress were both shaken by the course of events, in September, a Congress-led interim government was installed, with Jawaharlal Nehru as united India&#x27;s prime minister.

The communal violence spread to Bihar (where Hindus attacked Muslims), to Noakhali in Bengal (where Muslims targeted Hindus), to Garhmukteshwar in the United Provinces (where Hindus attacked Muslims), and on to Rawalpindi in March 1947 in which Hindus and Sikhs were attacked or driven out by Muslims.

====Plan for partition: 1946–1947====
In London, the president of the India League, V. K. Krishna Menon, nominated Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma as the only suitable viceregal candidate in clandestine meetings with Sir Stafford Cripps and Clement Attlee. Prime Minister Attlee subsequently appointed Lord Louis Mountbatten as India&#x27;s last viceroy, giving him the task to oversee British India&#x27;s independence by 30 June 1948, with the instruction to avoid partition and preserve a united India, but with adaptable authority to ensure a British withdrawal with minimal setbacks. Mountbatten hoped to revive the Cabinet Mission scheme for a federal arrangement for India. But despite his initial keenness for preserving the centre, the tense communal situation caused him to conclude that partition had become necessary for a quicker transfer of power.

====Proposal of the &quot;Indian Independence Act&quot;====
When Lord Mountbatten formally proposed the plan on 3 June 1947, Patel gave his approval and lobbied Nehru and other Congress leaders to accept the proposal. Knowing Gandhi&#x27;s deep anguish regarding proposals of partition, Patel engaged him in private meetings discussions over the perceived practical unworkability of any Congress-League coalition, the rising violence, and the threat of civil war. At the All India Congress Committee meeting called to vote on the proposal, Patel said:I fully appreciate the fears of our brothers from [the Muslim-majority areas]. Nobody likes the division of India, and my heart is heavy. But the choice is between one division and many divisions. We must face facts. We cannot give way to emotionalism and sentimentality. The Working Committee has not acted out of fear. But I am afraid of one thing, that all our toil and hard work of these many years might go waste or prove unfruitful. My nine months in office have completely disillusioned me regarding the supposed merits of the Cabinet Mission Plan. Except for a few honourable exceptions, Muslim officials from the top down to the chaprasis (peons or servants) are working for the League. The communal veto given to the League in the Mission Plan would have blocked India&#x27;s progress at every stage. Whether we like it or not, de facto Pakistan already exists in the Punjab and Bengal. Under the circumstances, I would prefer a de jure Pakistan, which may make the League more responsible. Freedom is coming. We have 75 to 80 percent of India, which we can make strong with our genius. The League can develop the rest of the country.Following Gandhi&#x27;s denial and Congress&#x27; approval of the plan, Patel, Rajendra Prasad, C. Rajagopalachari represented Congress on the Partition Council, with Jinnah, Liaqat Ali Khan and Abdur Rab Nishtar representing the Muslim League. Late in 1946, the Labour government in Britain, its exchequer exhausted by the recently concluded World War II, decided to end British rule of India, with power being transferred no later than June 1948. With the British army unprepared for the potential for increased violence, the new viceroy, Louis Mountbatten, advanced the date, allowing less than six months for a mutually agreed plan for independence.

====Radcliffe Line====

In June 1947, the nationalist leaders, including Nehru, Valllabh Bhai Patel and J B Kripalini on behalf of the Congress, Jinnah, Liaqat Ali Khan, and Abdul Rab Nishtar representing the Muslim League, and Master Tara Singh representing the Sikhs, agreed to a partition of the country in stark opposition to Gandhi&#x27;s opposition to partition. The predominantly Hindu and Sikh areas were assigned to the new India and predominantly Muslim areas to the new nation of Pakistan; the plan included a partition of the Muslim-majority provinces of Punjab and Bengal. The communal violence that accompanied the publication of the Radcliffe Line, the line of partition, was even more horrific. Describing the violence that accompanied the partition of India, historians Ian Talbot and Gurharpal Singh wrote:There are numerous eyewitness accounts of the maiming and mutilation of victims. The catalogue of horrors includes the disemboweling of pregnant women, the slamming of babies&#x27; heads against brick walls, the cutting off of the victim&#x27;s limbs and genitalia, and the displaying of heads and corpses. While previous communal riots had been deadly, the scale and level of brutality during the Partition massacres were unprecedented. Although some scholars question the use of the term &#x27;genocide&#x27; concerning the partition massacres, much of the violence was manifested with genocidal tendencies. It was designed to cleanse an existing generation and prevent its future reproduction.&quot;

====Independence: August 1947====
Mountbatten administered the independence oath to Jinnah on the 14th, before leaving for India where the oath was scheduled on the midnight of the 15th. On 14 August 1947, the new Dominion of Pakistan came into being, with Muhammad Ali Jinnah sworn in as its first Governor-General in Karachi. The following day, 15 August 1947, India, now Dominion of India, became an independent country, with official ceremonies taking place in New Delhi, Jawaharlal Nehru assuming the office of prime minister. Mountbatten remained in New Delhi for 10 months, serving as the first governor-general of an independent India until June 1948. Gandhi remained in Bengal to work with the new refugees from the partitioned subcontinent.

==Geographic partition, 1947==

===Mountbatten Plan===

At a press conference on 3 June 1947, Lord Mountbatten announced the date of independence – 14 August 1947 – and also outlined the actual division of British India between the two new dominions in what became known as the &quot;Mountbatten Plan&quot; or the &quot;3 June Plan&quot;. The plan&#x27;s main points were:
* Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims in Punjab and Bengal legislative assemblies would meet and vote for partition. If a simple majority of either group wanted partition, then these provinces would be divided.
* Sind and Baluchistan were to make their own decision.
* The fate of North-West Frontier Province and Sylhet district of Assam was to be decided by a referendum.
* The separate independence of Bengal was ruled out.
* A boundary commission to be set up in case of partition.

The Indian political leaders had accepted the Plan on 2 June. It could not deal with the question of the princely states, which were not British possessions, but on 3 June Mountbatten advised them against remaining independent and urged them to join one of the two new Dominions.

The Muslim League&#x27;s demands for a separate country were thus conceded. The Congress&#x27;s position on unity was also taken into account while making Pakistan as small as possible. Mountbatten&#x27;s formula was to divide India and, at the same time, retain maximum possible unity. Abul Kalam Azad expressed concern over the likelihood of violent riots, to which Mountbatten replied:At least on this question I shall give you complete assurance. I shall see to it that there is no bloodshed and riot. I am a soldier and not a civilian. Once the partition is accepted in principle, I shall issue orders to see that there are no communal disturbances anywhere in the country. If there should be the slightest agitation, I shall adopt the sternest measures to nip the trouble in the bud. Jagmohan has stated that this and what followed showed a &quot;glaring failure of the government machinery.&quot;

On 3 June 1947, the partition plan was accepted by the Congress Working Committee. &quot;Boloji&quot; states that in Punjab, there were no riots, but there was communal tension, while Gandhi was reportedly isolated by Nehru and Patel and observed &quot;maun vrat&quot; (day of silence). Mountbatten visited Gandhi and said he hoped that he would not oppose the partition, to which Gandhi wrote the reply: &quot;Have I ever opposed you?&quot;
Within British India, the border between India and Pakistan (the Radcliffe Line) was determined by a British Government-commissioned report prepared under the chairmanship of a London barrister, Sir Cyril Radcliffe. Pakistan came into being with two non-contiguous areas, East Pakistan (today Bangladesh) and West Pakistan, separated geographically by India. India was formed out of the majority Hindu regions of British India, and Pakistan from the majority Muslim areas.

On 18 July 1947, the British Parliament passed the Indian Independence Act that finalized the arrangements for partition and abandoned British suzerainty over the princely states, of which there were several hundred, leaving them free to choose whether to accede to one of the new dominions or to remain independent outside both. The Government of India Act 1935 was adapted to provide a legal framework for the new dominions.

Following its creation as a new country in August 1947, Pakistan applied for membership of the United Nations and was accepted by the General Assembly on 30 September 1947. The Dominion of India continued to have the existing seat as India had been a founding member of the United Nations since 1945.

===Punjab Boundary Commission===

The Punjab—the region of the five rivers east of Indus: Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej—consists of inter-fluvial &quot;doabs&quot; (&#x27;two rivers&#x27;), or tracts of land lying between two confluent rivers (see map on the right):
* the &quot;Sindh-Sagar&quot; doab (between Indus and Jhelum);
* the &quot;Jech&quot; doab (Jhelum/Chenab);
* the &quot;Rechna&quot; doab (Chenab/Ravi);
* the &quot;Bari&quot; doab (Ravi/Beas); and
* the &quot;Bist&quot; doab (Beas/Sutlej).

In early 1947, in the months leading up to the deliberations of the Punjab Boundary Commission, the main disputed areas appeared to be in the Bari and Bist doabs. Some areas in the Rechna doab were claimed by the Congress and Sikhs. In the Bari doab, the districts of Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Lahore, and Montgomery were all disputed. All districts (other than Amritsar, which was 46.5% Muslim) had Muslim majorities; albeit, in Gurdaspur, the Muslim majority, at 51.1%, was slender. At a smaller area-scale, only three &quot;tehsils&quot; (sub-units of a district) in the Bari doab had non-Muslim majorities: Pathankot, in the extreme north of Gurdaspur, which was not in dispute; and Amritsar and Tarn Taran in Amritsar district. Nonetheless, there were four Muslim-majority tehsils east of Beas-Sutlej, in two of which Muslims outnumbered Hindus and Sikhs together.

Before the Boundary Commission began formal hearings, governments were set up for the East and the West Punjab regions. Their territories were provisionally divided by &quot;notional division&quot; based on simple district majorities. In both the Punjab and Bengal, the Boundary Commission consisted of two Muslim and two non-Muslim judges with Sir Cyril Radcliffe as a common chairman. The mission of the Punjab commission was worded generally as: &quot;To demarcate the boundaries of the two parts of Punjab, based on ascertaining the contiguous majority areas of Muslims and non-Muslims. In doing so, it will take into account other factors.&quot; Each side (the Muslims and the Congress/Sikhs) presented its claim through counsel with no liberty to bargain. The judges, too, had no mandate to compromise, and on all major issues they &quot;divided two and two, leaving Sir Cyril Radcliffe the invidious task of making the actual decisions.&quot;

==Independence, migration, and displacement==
Mass migration occurred between the two newly formed states in the months immediately following the partition. There was no conception that population transfers would be necessary because of the partitioning. Religious minorities were expected to stay put in the states they found themselves residing. An exception was made for Punjab, where the transfer of populations was organized because of the communal violence affecting the province; this did not apply to other provinces.

The population of undivided India in 1947 was about 390 million. Following the partition, there were perhaps 330 million people in India, 30 million in West Pakistan, and 30 million people in East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh). Once the boundaries were established, about 14.5 million people crossed the borders to what they hoped was the relative safety of religious majority. The 1951 Census of Pakistan identified the number of displaced persons in Pakistan at 7,226,600, presumably all Muslims who had entered Pakistan from India; the 1951 Census of India counted 7,295,870 displaced persons, apparently all Hindus and Sikhs who had moved to India from Pakistan immediately after the partition.

During Partition, a full population exchange was a contentious issue that received differing opinions among Indian leaders. B.R. Ambedkar and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel supported the idea of a complete population exchange between India and Pakistan. This meant that all the 42 million Muslims in India would move to Pakistan, while all the 19 million Hindus, Sikhs and other minorities in West and East Pakistan would migrate to India. Their rationale was rooted in ensuring lasting communal peace by eliminating the possibility of future inter-religious conflicts and reducing the risk of large-scale violence. Ambedkar had argued in his writings, including Thoughts on Linguistic States, that such a population exchange, though harsh, was a practical solution to the communal problem that had led to Partition. Similarly, Patel, the Iron Man of India, believed that the lingering presence of hostile minorities could lead to future instability. They saw the success of the earlier population exchange between Greece and Turkey after the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) as a precedent. However, this proposal was rejected by Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi, who strongly opposed the idea of compulsory population exchange. Nehru and Gandhi upheld the vision of a secular India where communities could coexist peacefully regardless of religion. They believed that a forced population transfer would cause immense suffering and disrupt the social fabric. Gandhi, in particular, had faith in Hindu-Muslim unity and insisted that Muslims who chose to stay in India should be welcomed as equal citizens. As a result, the full population exchange did not occur. While a partial migration took place, with around 14 million people crossing borders amidst horrific violence, millions remained on both sides. This decision had profound consequences. India retained its Muslim population, which grew to become a significant minority, while Pakistan’s Hindu and Sikh populations dwindled drastically over the decades due to migration and persecution. The absence of a full exchange has led to enduring communal tensions and periodic conflicts over the years, with proponents arguing that such an exchange might have prevented these issues.

==Regions affected by partition==
The newly formed governments had not anticipated, and were completely unequipped for, a two-way migration of such staggering magnitude. Massive violence and slaughter occurred on both sides of the new India–Pakistan border.

On 13 January 1948, Mahatma Gandhi started his fast with the goal of stopping the violence. Over 100 religious leaders gathered at Birla House and accepted the conditions of Gandhi. Thousands of Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs gathered outside Birla house to uphold peace and unity. Representatives of organisations including Hindu Mahasabha, Jamait-ul-Ulema, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), visited Birla house to pledge communal harmony and the end of violence. Maulana Azad, Jawaharlal Nehru and Pakistan&#x27;s High Commissioner to India Zahid Hussain also made their visit. By 18 January, Gandhi agreed to break his fast. This fast is credited for putting an end to communal violence.

While estimates of the number of deaths vary greatly, ranging from 200,000 to 2,000,000, most of the scholars accept approximately 1 million died in the partition violence. The worst case of violence among all regions is concluded to have taken place in Punjab.

===Punjab===
The Partition of India split the former British province of Punjab between the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan. The mostly Muslim western part of the province became Pakistan&#x27;s Punjab province; the mostly Hindu and Sikh eastern part became India&#x27;s East Punjab state (later divided into the new states of Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh). Many Hindus and Sikhs lived in the west, and many Muslims lived in the east, and the fears of all such minorities were so great that the partition saw many people displaced and much inter-communal violence. Some have described the violence in Punjab as a retributive genocide. Total migration across Punjab during the partition is estimated at 12 million people; around 6.5 million Muslims moved into West Punjab, and 4.7 million Hindus and Sikhs moved into East Punjab.

Virtually no Muslim survived in East Punjab (except in Malerkotla and Nuh) and virtually no Hindu or Sikh survived in West Punjab (except in Rahim Yar Khan and Bahawalpur).

Lawrence James observed that &quot;Sir Francis Mudie, the governor of West Punjab, estimated that 500,000 Muslims died trying to enter his province, while the British High Commissioner in Karachi put the full total at 800,000. This makes nonsense of the claim by Mountbatten and his partisans that only 200,000 were killed&quot;: [James 1998: 636].

During this period, many alleged that Sikh leader Tara Singh was endorsing the killing of Muslims. On 3 March 1947, at Lahore, Singh, along with about 500 Sikhs, declared from a dais &quot;Death to Pakistan.&quot; According to political scientist Ishtiaq Ahmed:

On March 3, radical Sikh leader Master Tara Singh famously flashed his kirpan (sword) outside the Punjab Assembly, calling for the destruction of the Pakistan idea prompting violent response by the Muslims mainly against Sikhs but also Hindus, in the Muslim-majority districts of northern Punjab. Yet, at the end of that year, more Muslims had been killed in East Punjab than Hindus and Sikhs together in West Punjab.

Nehru wrote to Gandhi on 22 August that, up to that point, twice as many Muslims had been killed in East Punjab than Hindus and Sikhs in West Punjab.

===Bengal===

The province of Bengal was divided into the two separate entities of West Bengal, awarded to the Dominion of India, and East Bengal, awarded to the Dominion of Pakistan. East Bengal was renamed East Pakistan in 1955, and later became the independent nation of Bangladesh after the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971.

The districts of Murshidabad and Malda, located on the right bank of the Ganges, were given to India despite having Muslim majorities. The Hindu-majority Khulna District, located on the mouths of the Ganges and surrounded by Muslim-majority districts, were given to Pakistan, as were the eastern-most Chittagong Hill Tracts.

Thousands of Hindus, located in the districts of East Bengal, which were awarded to Pakistan, found themselves being attacked, and this religious persecution forced hundreds of thousands of Hindus from East Bengal to seek refuge in India. The massive influx of Hindu refugees into Calcutta affected the demographics of the city. Many Muslims left the city for East Pakistan, and the refugee families occupied some of their homes and properties.

Total migration across Bengal during the partition is estimated at 3.3 million: 2.6 million Hindus moved from East Pakistan to India and 0.7 million Muslims moved from India to East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).

====Chittagong Hill Tracts====
The sparsely populated Chittagong Hill Tracts were a special case. Located on the eastern limits of Bengal, it provided the Muslim-majority Chittagong with a hinterland. Despite the Tracts&#x27; 98.5% Buddhist majority in 1947 the territory was given to Pakistan.

===Sindh===
There was no mass violence in Sindh as there was in Punjab and Bengal.
At the time of partition, the majority of Sindh&#x27;s prosperous upper and middle class was Hindu. The Hindus were mostly concentrated in cities and formed the majority of the population in cities including Hyderabad, Karachi, Shikarpur, and Sukkur. During the initial months after partition, only some Hindus migrated. In late 1947, the situation began to change. Large numbers of Muslims refugees from India started arriving in Sindh and began to live in crowded refugee camps.

On 6 December 1947, communal violence broke out in Ajmer in India, precipitated by an argument between
some Sindhi Hindu refugees and local Muslims in the Dargah Bazaar. Violence in Ajmer again broke out in the middle of December with stabbings, looting and arson resulting in mostly Muslim casualties. Many Muslims fled across the Thar Desert to Sindh in Pakistan. This sparked further anti-Hindu riots in Hyderabad, Sindh. On 6 January anti-Hindu riots broke out in Karachi, leading to an estimate of 1100 casualties. The arrival of Sindhi Hindu refugees in North Gujarat&#x27;s town of Godhra in March 1948 again sparked riots there which led to more emigration of Muslims from Godhra to Pakistan. These events triggered the large scale exodus of Hindus.
An estimated 1.2 – 1.4 million Hindus migrated to India primarily by ship or train.

Despite the migration, a significant Sindhi Hindu population still resides in Pakistan&#x27;s Sindh province, where they number at around 2.3 million as per Pakistan&#x27;s 1998 census. Some districts in Sindh had a Hindu majority like Tharparkar District, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar and Badin.
Due to the religious persecution of Hindus in Pakistan, Hindus from Sindh are still migrating to India.

===Gujarat===
It experienced large refugee migrations.
An estimated 642,000 Muslims migrated to Pakistan, of which 75% went to Karachi largely due to business interests. The 1951 Census registered a drop of the Muslim population in the state from 13% in 1941 to 7% in 1951.

The number of incoming refugees was also quite large, with over a million people migrating to Gujarat.
These Hindu refugees were largely Sindhi and Gujarati.

===Delhi===

For centuries Delhi had been the capital of the Mughal Empire from Babur to the successors of Aurangzeb and previous Turkic Muslim rulers of North India. The series of Islamic rulers keeping Delhi as a stronghold of their empires left a vast array of Islamic architecture in Delhi, and a strong Islamic culture permeated the city. In 1911, when the British Raj shifted their colonial capital from Calcutta to Delhi, the nature of the city began changing. The core of the city was called &#x27;Lutyens&#x27; Delhi,&#x27; named after the British architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, and was designed to service the needs of the small but growing population of the British elite. Nevertheless, the 1941 census listed Delhi&#x27;s population as being 33.2% Muslim.

As refugees began pouring into Delhi in 1947, the city was ill-equipped to deal with the influx of refugees. Refugees &quot;spread themselves out wherever they could. They thronged into camps ... colleges, temples, &quot;gurudwaras&quot;, &quot;dharmshalas&quot;, military barracks, and gardens.&quot; By 1950, the government began allowing squatters to construct houses in certain portions of the city. As a result, neighbourhoods such as Lajpat Nagar and Patel Nagar sprang into existence, which carry a distinct Punjabi character to this day. As thousands of Hindu and Sikh refugees from West Punjab and North-West Frontier Province fled to the city, upheavals ensued as communal pogroms rocked the historical stronghold of Indo-Islamic culture and politics. A Pakistani diplomat in Delhi, Hussain, alleged that the Indian government was intent on eliminating Delhi&#x27;s Muslim population or was indifferent to their fate. He reported that army troops openly gunned down innocent Muslims. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru estimated 1,000 casualties in the city. Other sources put the casualty rate 20 times higher. Gyanendra Pandey&#x27;s 2010 account of the violence in Delhi puts the figure of Muslim casualties in Delhi at between 20,000 and 25,000.

Tens of thousands of Muslims were driven to refugee camps regardless of their political affiliations, and numerous historical sites in Delhi such as the Purana Qila, Idgah, and Nizamuddin were transformed into refugee camps. In fact, many Hindu and Sikh refugees eventually occupied the abandoned houses of Delhi&#x27;s Muslim inhabitants.

At the culmination of the tensions, total migration in Delhi during the partition is estimated at 830,000 people; around 330,000 Muslims had migrated to Pakistan and around 500,000 Hindus and Sikhs migrated from Pakistan to Delhi. The 1951 Census registered a drop of the Muslim population in the city from 33.2% in 1941 to 5.7% in 1951.

===Princely states===
In several cases, rulers of princely states were involved in communal violence or did not do enough to stop in time. Some rulers were away from their states for the summer, such as those of the Sikh states. Some believe that the rulers were whisked away by communal ministers in large part to avoid responsibility for the soon-to-come ethnic cleansing. In Bhawalpur and Patiala, upon the return of their ruler to the state, there was a marked decrease in violence, and the rulers consequently stood against the cleansing. The Nawab of Bahawalpur was away in Europe and returned on 1 October, shortening his trip. A bitter Hassan Suhrawardy would write to Mahatma Gandhi:

With the exceptions of Jind and Kapurthala, the violence was well organised in the Sikh states, with logistics provided by local government. In Patiala and Faridkot, the Maharajas responded to the call of Master Tara Singh to cleanse India of Muslims. The Maharaja of Patiala was offered the headship of a future united Sikh state that would rise from the &quot;ashes of a Punjab civil war.&quot; The Maharaja of Faridkot, Harinder Singh, is reported to have listened to stories of the massacres with great interest going so far as to ask for &quot;juicy details&quot; of the carnage. The Maharaja of Bharatpur State personally witnessed the cleansing of Muslim Meos at Khumbar and Deeg. When reproached by Muslims for his actions, Brijendra Singh retorted by saying: &quot;Why come to me? Go to Jinnah.&quot;

In Alwar and Bahawalpur communal sentiments extended to higher echelons of government, and the prime ministers of these States were said to have been involved in planning and directly overseeing the cleansing. In Bikaner, by contrast, the organisation occurred at much lower levels.

====Alwar and Bharatpur====
In Alwar and Bharatpur, princely states of Rajputana (modern-day Rajasthan), there were bloody confrontations between the dominant, Hindu land-holding community and the Muslim cultivating community. Well-organised bands of Hindu Jats, Ahirs and Gurjars, started attacking Muslim Meos in April 1947. By June, more than fifty Muslim villages had been destroyed. The Muslim League was outraged and demanded that the Viceroy provide Muslim troops. Accusations emerged in June of the involvement of Indian State Forces from Alwar and Bharatpur in the destruction of Muslim villages both inside their states and in British India.

In the wake of unprecedented violent attacks unleashed against them in 1947, 100,000 Muslim Meos from Alwar and Bharatpur were forced to flee their homes, and an estimated 30,000 are said to have been massacred. On 17 November, a column of 80,000 Meo refugees went to Pakistan. However, 10,000 stopped travelling due to the risks.

====Jammu and Kashmir====
In September–November 1947 in the Jammu region of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, a large number of Muslims were killed, and others driven away to West Punjab. The impetus for this violence was partly due to the &quot;harrowing stories of Muslim atrocities&quot;, brought by Hindu and Sikh refugees arriving to Jammu from West Punjab since March 1947. The killings were carried out by extremist Hindus and Sikhs, aided and abetted by the forces of the Jammu and Kashmir State, headed by the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir Hari Singh. Observers state that Hari Singh aimed to alter the demographics of the region by eliminating the Muslim population and ensure a Hindu majority. This was followed by a massacre of Hindus and Sikhs starting in November 1947, in Rajouri and Mirpur by Pashtun tribal militias and Pakistani soldiers. Women were raped and sexually assaulted. Many of those killed, raped and injured had come to these areas to escape massacres in West Punjab, which had become part of Pakistan.

==Resettlement of refugees: 1947–1951==

===Resettlement in India===
According to the 1951 Census of India, 2% of India&#x27;s population were refugees (1.3% from West Pakistan and 0.7% from East Pakistan).

The majority of Hindu and Sikh Punjabi refugees from West Punjab were settled in Delhi and East Punjab (including Haryana and Himachal Pradesh). Delhi received the largest number of refugees for a single city, with the population of Delhi showing an increase from under 1 million (917,939) in the Census of India, 1941, to a little less than 2 million (1,744,072) in the 1951 Census, despite a large number of Muslims leaving Delhi in 1947 to go to Pakistan whether voluntarily or by coercion. The incoming refugees were housed in various historical and military locations such as the Purana Qila, Red Fort, and military barracks in Kingsway Camp (around the present Delhi University). The latter became the site of one of the largest refugee camps in northern India, with more than 35,000 refugees at any given time besides Kurukshetra camp near Panipat. The campsites were later converted into permanent housing through extensive building projects undertaken by the Government of India from 1948 onwards. Many housing colonies in Delhi came up around this period, like Lajpat Nagar, Rajinder Nagar, Nizamuddin East, Punjabi Bagh, Rehgar Pura, Jangpura, and Kingsway Camp. Several schemes such as the provision of education, employment opportunities, and easy loans to start businesses were provided for the refugees at the all-India level. Many Punjabi Hindu refugees were also settled in Cities of Western and Central Uttar Pradesh. A Colony consisting largely of Sikhs and Punjabi Hindus was also founded in Central Mumbai&#x27;s Sion Koliwada region, and named Guru Tegh Bahadur Nagar.

Hindus fleeing from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) were settled across Eastern, Central and Northeastern India, many ending up in neighbouring Indian states such as West Bengal, Assam, and Tripura. Substantial number of refugees were also settled in Madhya Pradesh (incl. Chhattisgarh) Bihar (incl. Jharkhand), Odisha and Andaman islands (where Bengalis today form the largest linguistic group)

Sindhi Hindus settled predominantly in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan. Substantial numbers, however, were also settled in Madhya Pradesh, A few also settled in Delhi. A new township was established for Sindhi Hindu refugees in Maharashtra. The Governor-General of India, Sir Rajagopalachari, laid the foundation for this township and named it Ulhasnagar (&#x27;city of joy&#x27;).

Substantial communities of Hindu Gujarati and Marathi Refugees who had lived in the cities of Sindh and Southern Punjab were also resettled in the cities of modern-day Gujarat and Maharashtra.

A small community of Pashtun Hindus from Loralai, Balochistan was also settled in Jaipur. Today they number around 1,000.

====Refugee camps====
The list below shows the number of relief camps in districts of Punjab and their population up to December 1948.
===Resettlement in Pakistan===
The 1951 Census of Pakistan recorded that the most significant number of Muslim refugees came from the East Punjab and nearby Rajputana states (Alwar and Bharatpur). They numbered 5,783,100 and constituted 80.1% of Pakistan&#x27;s total refugee population. This was the effect of the retributive ethnic cleansing on both sides of the Punjab where the Muslim population of East Punjab was forcibly expelled like the Hindu/Sikh population in West Punjab.

Migration from other regions of India were as follows: Bihar, West Bengal, and Orissa, 700,300 or 9.8%; UP and Delhi 464,200 or 6.4%; Gujarat and Bombay, 160,400 or 2.2%; Bhopal and Hyderabad 95,200 or 1.2%; and Madras and Mysore 18,000 or 0.2%.

So far as their settlement in Pakistan is concerned, 97.4% of the refugees from East Punjab and its contiguous areas went to West Punjab; 95.9% from Bihar, West Bengal and Orissa to the erstwhile East Pakistan; 95.5% from UP and Delhi to West Pakistan, mainly in Karachi Division of Sindh; 97.2% from Bhopal and Hyderabad to West Pakistan, mainly Karachi; and 98.9% from Bombay and Gujarat to West Pakistan, largely to Karachi; and 98.9% from Madras and Mysore went to West Pakistan, mainly Karachi.

West Punjab received the largest number of refugees (73.1%), mainly from East Punjab and its contiguous areas. Sindh received the second largest number of refugees, 16.1% of the total migrants, while the Karachi division of Sindh received 8.5% of the total migrant population. East Bengal received the third-largest number of refugees, 699,100, who constituted 9.7% of the total Muslim refugee population in Pakistan. 66.7% of the refugees in East Bengal originated from West Bengal, 14.5% from Bihar and 11.8% from Assam.

NWFP and Baluchistan received the lowest number of migrants. NWFP received 51,100 migrants (0.7% of the migrant population) while Baluchistan received 28,000 (0.4% of the migrant population).

The government undertook a census of refugees in West Punjab in 1948, which displayed their place of origin in India.

====Data====



== Missing people ==
A study of the total population inflows and outflows in the districts of Punjab, using the data provided by the 1931 and 1951 Census has led to an estimate of 1.3 million missing Muslims who left western India but did not reach Pakistan. The corresponding number of missing Hindus/Sikhs along the western border is estimated to be approximately 0.8 million. This puts the total of missing people, due to partition-related migration along the Punjab border, to around 2.2 million.
Another study of the demographic consequences of partition in the Punjab region using the 1931, 1941 and 1951 censuses concluded that between 2.3 and 3.2 million people went missing in the Punjab.

==Rehabilitation of women==
Both sides promised each other that they would try to restore women abducted and raped during the riots. The Indian government claimed that 33,000 Hindu and Sikh women were abducted, and the Pakistani government claimed that 50,000 Muslim women were abducted during riots. By 1949, there were legal claims that 12,000 women had been recovered in India and 6,000 in Pakistan. By 1954, there were 20,728 Muslim women recovered from India, and 9,032 Hindu and Sikh women recovered from Pakistan. Most of the Hindu and Sikh women refused to go back to India, fearing that their families would never accept them, a fear mirrored by Muslim women.

Some scholars have noted some &#x27;positive&#x27; effects of partition on women in both Bengal and Punjab. In Bengal, it had some emancipatory effects on refugee women from East Bengal, who took up jobs to help their families, entered the public space and participated in political movements. The disintegration of traditional family structures could have increased the space for the agency of women. Many women also actively participated in the communist movement that later took place in West Bengal of India. Regarding Indian Punjab, one scholar has noted, &quot;Partition narrowed the physical spaces and enlarged the social spaces available to women, thereby affecting the practice of purda or seclusion, modified the impact of caste and regional culture on marriage arrangements and widened the channels of educational mobility and employment for girls and women.&quot;

==Post-partition migration==

===Pakistan===
Due to persecution of Muslims in India, even after the 1951 Census, many Muslim families from India continued migrating to Pakistan throughout the 1950s and the early 1960s. According to historian Omar Khalidi, the Indian Muslim migration to West Pakistan between December 1947 and December 1971 was from Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala. The next stage of migration was between 1973 and the 1990s, and the primary destination for these migrants was Karachi and other urban centres in Sindh.

In 1959, the International Labour Organization (ILO) published a report stating that from 1951 to 1956, a total of 650,000 Muslims from India relocated to West Pakistan. However, Visaria (1969) raised doubts about the authenticity of the claims about Indian Muslim migration to Pakistan, since the 1961 Census of Pakistan did not corroborate these figures. However, the 1961 Census of Pakistan did incorporate a statement suggesting that there had been a migration of 800,000 people from India to Pakistan throughout the previous decade. Of those who left for Pakistan, most never came back.

Indian Muslim migration to Pakistan declined drastically in the 1970s, a trend noticed by the Pakistani authorities. In June 1995, Pakistan&#x27;s interior minister, Naseerullah Babar, informed the National Assembly that between the period of 1973–1994, as many as 800,000 visitors came from India on valid travel documents. Of these only 3,393 stayed. In a related trend, intermarriages between Indian and Pakistani Muslims have declined sharply. According to a November 1995 statement of Riaz Khokhar, the Pakistani High Commissioner in New Delhi, the number of cross-border marriages has dropped from 40,000 a year in the 1950s and 1960s to barely 300 annually.

In the aftermath of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, 3,500 Muslim families migrated from the Indian part of the Thar Desert to the Pakistani section of the Thar Desert. 400 families were settled in Nagar after the 1965 war and an additional 3000 settled in the Chachro taluka in Sindh province of West Pakistan. The government of Pakistan provided each family with 12 acres of land. According to government records, this land totalled 42,000 acres.

The 1951 census in Pakistan recorded 671,000 refugees in East Pakistan, the majority of which came from West Bengal. The rest were from Bihar. According to the ILO in the period 1951–1956, half a million Indian Muslims migrated to East Pakistan. By 1961 the numbers reached 850,000. In the aftermath of the riots in Ranchi and Jamshedpur, Biharis continued to migrate to East Pakistan well into the late sixties and added up to around a million. Crude estimates suggest that about 1.5 million Muslims migrated from West Bengal and Bihar to East Bengal in the two decades after partition.

===India===
Due to religious persecution in Pakistan, Hindus continue to flee to India. Most of them tend to settle in the state of Rajasthan in India. According to data of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, just around 1,000 Hindu families fled to India in 2013. In May 2014, a member of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, revealed in the National Assembly of Pakistan that around 5,000 Hindus are migrating from Pakistan to India every year. Since India is not a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention, it refuses to recognise Pakistani Hindu migrants as refugees.

The population in the Tharparkar district in the Sindh province of West Pakistan was 80% Hindu and 20% Muslim at the time of independence in 1947. During the Indo-Pakistani Wars of 1965 and 1971, an estimated 1,500 Hindu families fled to India, which led to a massive demographic shift in the district. During these same wars, 23,300 Hindu families also migrated to Jammu Division from Azad Kashmir and West Punjab.

The migration of Hindus from East Pakistan to India continued unabated after partition. The 1951 census in India recorded that 2.5 million refugees arrived from East Pakistan, of which 2.1 million migrated to West Bengal while the rest migrated to Assam, Tripura, and other states. These refugees arrived in waves and did not come solely at partition. By 1973, their number reached over 6 million. The following data displays the major waves of refugees from East Pakistan and the incidents which precipitated the migrations:

====Post-partition migration to India from East Pakistan====
In 1978, India gave citizenship to 55,000 Pakistani Hindus. By the time of the 1998 Census of Pakistan, Muslims made up 64.4% of the population and Hindus 35.6% of the population in Tharparkar.
Around 70,000 Hindus migrated to India due to increased persecution in the aftermath of the riots and mob attacks in response to Demolition of the Babri Masjid.

==Perspectives==

The partition was a highly controversial arrangement, and remains a cause of much tension on the Indian subcontinent today. According to American scholar Allen McGrath, many British leaders including the British Viceroy, Mountbatten, were unhappy over the partition of India. Louis Mountbatten had not only been accused of rushing the process through but also is alleged to have influenced the Radcliffe Line in India&#x27;s favour. The commission took longer to decide on a final boundary than on the partition itself. Thus the two nations were granted their independence even before there was a defined boundary between them. The boundary line was revealed on 17 August, two days after the partition. This implied that the boundary location was delayed in order to complete the British withdrawal from India so that the British cannot be burdened by the partition.

Some critics allege that British haste led to increased cruelties during the partition. Because independence was declared &quot;prior&quot; to the actual partition, it was up to the new governments of India and Pakistan to keep public order. No large population movements were contemplated; the plan called for safeguards for minorities on both sides of the new border. It was a task at which both states failed. There was a complete breakdown of law and order; many died in riots, massacre, or just from the hardships of their flight to safety. What ensued was one of the largest population movements in recorded history. According to Richard Symonds, at the lowest estimate, half a million people perished and twelve million became homeless.

However, many argue that the British were forced to expedite the partition by events on the ground. Once in office, Mountbatten quickly became aware that if Britain were to avoid involvement in a civil war, which seemed increasingly likely, there was no alternative to partition and a hasty exit from India. Law and order had broken down many times before partition, with much bloodshed on both sides. A massive civil war was looming by the time Mountbatten became Viceroy. After the Second World War, Britain had limited resources, perhaps insufficient to the task of keeping order. Another viewpoint is that while Mountbatten may have been too hasty, he had no real options left and achieved the best he could under difficult circumstances. The historian Lawrence James concurs that in 1947 Mountbatten was left with no option but to cut and run. The alternative seemed to be involved in a potentially bloody civil war from which it would be difficult to get out.

When the 2017 film Viceroy&#x27;s House was being made, pertaining to Partition, Britain&#x27;s then-Prince Charles, who is a great-nephew of Mountbatten, recommended the book &quot;The Shadow of the Great Game: The Untold Story of India&#x27;s Partition&quot; to the filmmaker. The book argues that Mountbatten had been used by the British establishment, which had long sought Partition to maintain a strategic base in northwestern South Asia that could guard British interests in the Middle East and check Soviet advances (see also Great Game#On India).

Venkat Dhulipala rejects the idea that the British divide and rule policy was responsible for partition and elaborates on the perspective that Pakistan was popularly imagined as a sovereign Islamic state or a &#x27;New Medina&#x27;, as a potential successor to the defunct Turkish caliphate and as a leader and protector of the entire Islamic world. Islamic scholars debated over creating Pakistan and its potential to become a true Islamic state. The majority of Barelvis supported the creation of Pakistan and believed that any co-operation with Hindus would be counterproductive. Most Deobandis, who were led by Maulana Husain Ahmad Madani, were opposed to the creation of Pakistan and the two-nation theory. According to them Muslims and Hindus could be a part of a single nation.

In their authoritative study of the partition, Ian Talbot and Gurharpal Singh have said that the partition was not the inevitable end of the so-called British &#x27;divide and rule policy&#x27; nor was it the inevitable end of Hindu-Muslim differences.

A cross-border student initiative, &quot;The History Project&quot;, was launched in 2014 to explore the differences in perception of the events leading up to the partition. The project resulted in a book that explains both interpretations of the shared history in Pakistan and India.

==Documentation efforts, oral history and legacy==
In 2010, a Berkeley, California and Delhi, India-based non-profit organization, The 1947 Partition Archive, began documenting oral histories from those who lived through the partition and consolidated the interviews into an archive. As of June 2021, nearly 9,700 interviews are preserved from 18 countries and are being released in collaboration with five university libraries in India and Pakistan, including Ashoka University, Habib University, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Guru Nanak Dev University and Delhi University in collaboration with Tata Trusts.

In August 2017, The Arts and Cultural Heritage Trust (TAACHT) of United Kingdom set up what they describe as &quot;the world&#x27;s first Partition Museum&quot; at Town Hall in Amritsar, Punjab. The Museum, which is open from Tuesday to Sunday, offers multimedia exhibits and documents that describe both the political process that led to partition and carried it forward, and video and written narratives offered by survivors of the events.

A 2019 book by Kavita Puri, &quot;Partition Voices: Untold British Stories&quot;, based on the BBC Radio 4 documentary series of the same name, includes interviews with about two dozen people who witnessed partition and subsequently migrated to Britain.

On 14 August 2021, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced &quot;Partition Horrors Remembrance Day&quot; to remind the nation of the sufferings of the Indians during the partition. This move was criticised by the Congress with Jairam Ramesh saying that the day has been conceptualised with biased intent and its aim is to use traumatic events as &quot;fodder&quot; for Modi&#x27;s current political fights.

===Artistic depictions of the partition===
The partition of India and the associated bloody riots inspired many in India and Pakistan to create literary, cinematic, and artistic depictions of this event. While some creations depicted the massacres during the refugee migration, others concentrated on the aftermath of the partition and the difficulties faced by the refugees in both sides of the border. Works of fiction, films, and art that relate to the events of partition continue to be made to the present day.

====Literature====
Literature describing the human cost of independence and partition includes, among others:
* &quot;Terhi Lakir&quot; (The Crooked Line; 1943) by Ismat Chughtai
* &quot;Subh-e-Azadi&quot; (&#x27;Freedom&#x27;s Dawn&#x27;; 1947), Urdu poem by Faiz Ahmad Faiz
* &quot;Toba Tek Singh&quot; (1955), short story by Saadat Hassan Manto
* &quot;Train to Pakistan&quot; (1956) by Khushwant Singh
* &quot;A Bend in the Ganges&quot; (1965) by Manohar Malgonkar
* &quot;Tamas&quot; (1974) by Bhisham Sahni
* &quot;AZADI&quot; (1975) by Chaman Nahal, originally written in English and winner of the 1977 Sahitya Akedemi Award in India
* &quot;Ice-Candy Man&quot; (1988) by Bapsi Sidhwa
* What the Body Remembers (1999) by Shauna Singh Baldwin
* &quot;Forgotten Atrocities&quot; (2012), memoir by Bal K. Gupta

Salman Rushdie&#x27;s novel &quot;Midnight&#x27;s Children&quot; (1980), which won the Booker Prize and The Best of the Booker, wove its narrative based on the children born with magical abilities on midnight between 14 and 15 August 1947. &quot;Freedom at Midnight&quot; (1975) is a non-fiction work by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre that chronicled the events surrounding the first Independence Day celebrations in 1947.

The novel &quot;Lost Generations&quot; (2013) by Manjit Sachdeva describes the March 1947 massacre in rural areas of Rawalpindi by the Muslim League, followed by massacres on both sides of the new border in August 1947 seen through the eyes of an escaping Sikh family, their settlement and partial rehabilitation in Delhi, and ending in ruin (including death), for the second time in 1984, at the hands of mobs after a Sikh assassinated the prime minister.

====Film====
The partition has been a frequent topic in film. Early films relating to the circumstances of the independence, partition and the aftermath include:
* &quot;Lahore&quot; (1948)
* &quot;Chinnamul&quot; (1950, directed by Nemai Ghosh; Bengali)
* &quot;Nastik&quot; (1954)
* &quot;Chhalia&quot; (1960)
* &quot;Bhowani Junction&quot; (1956, directed by George Cukor)
* &quot;Dharmputra&quot; (1961)
* Ritwik Ghatak&#x27;s Bengali trilogy: &quot;Meghe Dhaka Tara&quot; (1960), &quot;Komal Gandhar&quot; (1961), and &quot;Subarnarekha&quot; (1962)
* &quot;Garm Hava&quot; (1973)
* &quot;Tamas&quot; (1987)
* &quot;Partition&quot; (1987)

From the late 1990s onwards, more films on the theme of partition were made, including several mainstream ones, such as:
* &quot;Earth&quot; (1998)
* &quot;Train to Pakistan&quot; (1998; based on the aforementioned book)
* &quot;Hey Ram&quot; (2000)
* &quot;&quot; (2001)
* &quot;Khamosh Pani&quot; (2003)
* &quot;Pinjar&quot; (2003)
* &quot;Partition&quot; (2007)
* &quot;Madrasapattinam&quot; (2010)
* &quot;Begum Jaan&quot; (2017)
* &quot;Viceroy&#x27;s House&quot; (2017)
* &quot;Sarhad&quot; (2019)
* &quot;Gandhi Godse – Ek Yudh&quot; (2023)

The biographical films &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982), &quot;Jinnah&quot; (1998), &quot;Sardar&quot; (1993), and &quot;Bhaag Milkha Bhaag&quot; (2013) also feature independence and partition as significant events in their screenplay. 
* The Pakistani drama &quot;Dastaan&quot;, based on the novel &quot;Bano&quot;, highlights the plight of Muslim girls who were abducted and raped during partition.
* The 2013 Google India &quot;Reunion&quot; advertisement, which is about the partition, has had a strong impact in India and Pakistan, leading to hope for the easing of travel restrictions between the two countries. The advertisement went viral and was viewed more than 1.6 million times before officially debuting on television on 15 November 2013. 
* The partition is also depicted in the historical sports drama film &quot;Gold&quot; (2018), based on events which impacted the Indian national field hockey team at the time.
* &quot;Demons of the Punjab&quot;, a 2018 episode of British sci-fi show &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, depicts the events of the partition from the perspective of a family torn apart by their religious differences.
* The Disney+ television series &quot;Ms. Marvel&quot; (2022) depicts a fictional version of the partition, from the perspective of a Muslim family fleeing to Pakistan.

====Art====
The early members of the Bombay Progressive Artist&#x27;s Group cited the partition as a key reason for its founding in December 1947. Those members included F. N. Souza, M. F. Husain, S. H. Raza, S. K. Bakre, H. A. Gade, and K. H. Ara, who went on to become some of the most important and influential Indian artists of the 20th century.

Contemporary Indian artists that have made significant artworks about the partition are Nalini Malani, Anjolie Ela Menon, Satish Gujral, Nilima Sheikh, Arpita Singh, Krishen Khanna, Pran Nath Mago, S. L. Parasher, Arpana Caur, Tayeba Begum Lipi, Mahbubur Rahman, Promotesh D Pulak, and Pritika Chowdhry.

Project Dastaan is a peace-building initiative that reconnects displaced refugees of the partition in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh with their childhood communities and villages through virtual reality digital experiences.

Artist Bindu Mehra has made digital films depicting lived memories of the partition, including &quot;The Inaccessible Narrative.&quot;

<text>A salt marsh, saltmarsh or salting, also known as a coastal salt marsh or a tidal marsh, is a coastal ecosystem in the upper coastal intertidal zone between land and open saltwater or brackish water that is regularly flooded by the tides. It is dominated by dense stands of salt-tolerant plants such as herbs, grasses, or low shrubs. These plants are terrestrial in origin and are essential to the stability of the salt marsh in trapping and binding sediments. Salt marshes play a large role in the aquatic food web and the delivery of nutrients to coastal waters. They also support terrestrial animals and provide coastal protection.

Salt marshes have historically been endangered by poorly implemented coastal management practices, with land reclaimed for human uses or polluted by upstream agriculture or other industrial coastal uses. Additionally, sea level rise caused by climate change is endangering other marshes, through erosion and submersion of otherwise tidal marshes. However, recent acknowledgment by both environmentalists and larger society for the importance of saltwater marshes for biodiversity, ecological productivity and other ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration, have led to an increase in salt marsh restoration and management since the 1980s.

==Basic information ==

Salt marshes occur on low-energy shorelines in temperate and high-latitudes which can be stable, emerging, or submerging depending if the sedimentation is greater, equal to, or lower than relative sea level rise (subsidence rate plus sea level change), respectively. Commonly these shorelines consist of mud or sand flats (known also as tidal flats or abbreviated to mudflats) which are nourished with sediment from inflowing rivers and streams. These typically include sheltered environments such as embankments, estuaries and the leeward side of barrier islands and spits. In the tropics and sub-tropics they are replaced by mangroves; an area that differs from a salt marsh in that instead of herbaceous plants, they are dominated by salt-tolerant trees.

Most salt marshes have a low topography with low elevations but a vast wide area, making them hugely popular for human populations.
Salt marshes are located among different landforms based on their physical and geomorphological settings. Such marsh landforms include deltaic marshes, estuarine, back-barrier, open coast, embayments and drowned-valley marshes. Deltaic marshes are associated with large rivers where many occur in Southern Europe such as the Camargue, France in the Rhône delta or the Ebro delta in Spain. They are also extensive within the rivers of the Mississippi River Delta in the United States. In New Zealand, most salt marshes occur at the head of estuaries in areas where there is little wave action and high sedimentation. Such marshes are located in Awhitu Regional Park in Auckland, the Manawatū Estuary, and the Avon Heathcote Estuary / Ihutai in Christchurch. Back-barrier marshes are sensitive to the reshaping of barriers in the landward side of which they have been formed. They are common along much of the eastern coast of the United States and the Frisian Islands. Large, shallow coastal embayments can hold salt marshes with examples including Morecambe Bay and Portsmouth in Britain and the Bay of Fundy in North America.

Salt marshes are sometimes included in lagoons, and the difference is not very marked; the Venetian Lagoon in Italy, for example, is made up of these sorts of animals and or living organisms belonging to this ecosystem. They have a big impact on the biodiversity of the area. Salt marsh ecology involves complex food webs which include primary producers (vascular plants, macroalgae, diatoms, epiphytes, and phytoplankton), primary consumers (zooplankton, macrozoa, molluscs, insects), and secondary consumers.

The low physical energy and high grasses provide a refuge for animals. Many marine fish use salt marshes as nursery grounds for their young before they move to open waters. Birds may raise their young among the high grasses, because the marsh provides both sanctuary from predators and abundant food sources which include fish trapped in pools, insects, shellfish, and worms.

== Worldwide occurrence ==
Saltmarshes across 99 countries (essentially worldwide) were mapped by Mcowen et al. 2017. A total of 5,495,089 hectares of mapped saltmarsh across 43 countries and territories are represented in a Geographic Information Systems polygon shapefile. This estimate is at the relatively low end of previous estimates (2.2–40 Mha). A later study conservatively estimated global saltmarsh extent as 90,800 km2 (9,080,000 hectares). The most extensive saltmarshes worldwide are found outside the tropics, notably including the low-lying, ice-free coasts, bays and estuaries of the North Atlantic which are well represented in their global polygon dataset.

==Formation==
The formation begins as tidal flats gain elevation relative to sea level by sediment accretion, and subsequently the rate and duration of tidal flooding decreases so that vegetation can colonize on the exposed surface. The arrival of propagules of pioneer species such as seeds or rhizome portions are combined with the development of suitable conditions for their germination and establishment in the process of colonisation. When rivers and streams arrive at the low gradient of the tidal flats, the discharge rate reduces and suspended sediment settles onto the tidal flat surface, helped by the backwater effect of the rising tide. Mats of filamentous blue-green algae can fix silt and clay sized sediment particles to their sticky sheaths on contact which can also increase the erosion resistance of the sediments. This assists the process of sediment accretion to allow colonising species (e.g., Salicornia spp.) to grow. These species retain sediment washed in from the rising tide around their stems and leaves and form low muddy mounds which eventually coalesce to form depositional terraces, whose upward growth is aided by a sub-surface root network which binds the sediment. Once vegetation is established on depositional terraces further sediment trapping and accretion can allow rapid upward growth of the marsh surface such that there is an associated rapid decrease in the depth and duration of tidal flooding. As a result, competitive species that prefer higher elevations relative to sea level can inhabit the area and often a succession of plant communities develops.

==Tidal flooding and vegetation zonation==

Coastal salt marshes can be distinguished from terrestrial habitats by the daily tidal flow that occurs and continuously floods the area. It is an important process in delivering sediments, nutrients and plant water supply to the marsh. At higher elevations in the upper marsh zone, there is much less tidal inflow, resulting in lower salinity levels. Soil salinity in the lower marsh zone is fairly constant due to everyday annual tidal flow. However, in the upper marsh, variability in salinity is shown as a result of less frequent flooding and climate variations. Rainfall can reduce salinity and evapotranspiration can increase levels during dry periods. As a result, there are microhabitats populated by different species of flora and fauna dependent on their physiological abilities. The flora of a salt marsh is differentiated into levels according to the plants&#x27; individual tolerance of salinity and water table levels. Vegetation found at the water must be able to survive high salt concentrations, periodical submersion, and a certain amount of water movement, while plants further inland in the marsh can sometimes experience dry, low-nutrient conditions. It has been found that the upper marsh zones limit species through competition and the lack of habitat protection, while lower marsh zones are determined through the ability of plants to tolerate physiological stresses such as salinity, water submergence and low oxygen levels.

The New England salt marsh is subject to strong tidal influences and shows distinct patterns of zonation. In low marsh areas with high tidal flooding, a monoculture of the smooth cordgrass, &quot;Spartina alterniflora&quot; dominate, then heading landwards, zones of the salt hay, &quot;Spartina patens&quot;, black rush, &quot;Juncus gerardii&quot; and the shrub &quot;Iva frutescens&quot; are seen respectively. These species all have different tolerances that make the different zones along the marsh best suited for each individual.

Plant species diversity is relatively low, since the flora must be tolerant of salt, complete or partial submersion, and anoxic mud substrate. The most common salt marsh plants are glassworts (&quot;Salicornia&quot; spp.) and the cordgrass (&quot;Spartina&quot; spp.), which have worldwide distribution. They are often the first plants to take hold in a mudflat and begin its ecological succession into a salt marsh. Their shoots lift the main flow of the tide above the mud surface while their roots spread into the substrate and stabilize the sticky mud and carry oxygen into it so that other plants can establish themselves as well. Plants such as sea lavenders (&quot;Limonium&quot; spp.), plantains (&quot;Plantago&quot; spp.), and varied sedges and rushes grow once the mud has been vegetated by the pioneer species.

Salt marshes are quite photosynthetically active and are extremely productive habitats. They serve as depositories for a large amount of organic matter and are full of decomposition, which feeds a broad food chain of organisms from bacteria to mammals. Many of the halophytic plants such as cordgrass are not grazed at all by higher animals but die off and decompose to become food for micro-organisms, which in turn become food for fish and birds.

==Sediment trapping, accretion, and the role of tidal creeks==
The factors and processes that influence the rate and spatial distribution of sediment accretion within the salt marsh are numerous. Sediment deposition can occur when marsh species provide a surface for the sediment to adhere to, followed by deposition onto the marsh surface when the sediment flakes off at low tide. The amount of sediment adhering to salt marsh species is dependent on the type of marsh species, the proximity of the species to the sediment supply, the amount of plant biomass, and the elevation of the species. For example, in a study of the Eastern Chongming Island and Jiuduansha Island tidal marshes at the mouth of the Yangtze River, China, the amount of sediment adhering to the species &quot;Spartina alterniflora&quot;, &quot;Phragmites australis&quot;, and &quot;Scirpus mariqueter&quot; decreased with distance from the highest levels of suspended sediment concentrations (found at the marsh edge bordering tidal creeks or the mudflats); decreased with those species at the highest elevations, which experienced the lowest frequency and depth of tidal inundations; and increased with increasing plant biomass. &quot;Spartina alterniflora&quot;, which had the most sediment adhering to it, may contribute &gt;10% of the total marsh surface sediment accretion by this process.

Salt marsh species also facilitate sediment accretion by decreasing current velocities and encouraging sediment to settle out of suspension. Current velocities can be reduced as the stems of tall marsh species induce hydraulic drag, with the effect of minimising re-suspension of sediment and encouraging deposition. Measured concentrations of suspended sediment in the water column have been shown to decrease from the open water or tidal creeks adjacent to the marsh edge, to the marsh interior, probably as a result of direct settling to the marsh surface by the influence of the marsh canopy.

Inundation and sediment deposition on the marsh surface is also assisted by tidal creeks which are a common feature of salt marshes. Their typically dendritic and meandering forms provide avenues for the tide to rise and flood the marsh surface, as well as to drain water, and they may facilitate higher amounts of sediment deposition than salt marsh bordering open ocean. Sediment deposition is correlated with sediment size: coarser sediments will deposit at higher elevations (closer to the creek) than finer sediments (further from the creek). Sediment size is also often correlated with particular trace metals, and thus tidal creeks can affect metal distributions and concentrations in salt marshes, in turn affecting the biota. Salt marshes do not however require tidal creeks to facilitate sediment flux over their surface although salt marshes with this morphology seem to be rarely studied.

The elevation of marsh species is important; those species at lower elevations experience longer and more frequent tidal floods and therefore have the opportunity for more sediment deposition to occur. Species at higher elevations can benefit from a greater chance of inundation at the highest tides when increased water depths and marsh surface flows can penetrate into the marsh interior.

==Human impacts==
The coast is a highly attractive natural feature to humans through its beauty, resources, and accessibility. As of 2002, over half of the world&#x27;s population was estimated to being living within 60 km of the coastal shoreline, making coastlines highly vulnerable to human impacts from daily activities that put pressure on these surrounding natural environments. In the past, salt marshes were perceived as coastal &#x27;wastelands,&#x27; causing considerable loss and change of these ecosystems through land reclamation for agriculture, urban development, salt production and recreation. The indirect effects of human activities such as nitrogen loading also play a major role in the salt marsh area. Salt marshes can suffer from dieback in the high marsh and die-off in the low marsh. A study published in 2022 estimates that 22% of saltmarsh loss from 1999–2019 was due to direct human drivers, defined as observable activities occurring at the location of the detected change, such as conversion to aquaculture, agriculture, coastal development, or other physical structures. Additionally, 30% of saltmarsh gain over this same time period were also due to direct drivers, such as restoration activities or coastal modifications to promote tidal exchange.

===Land reclamation===
Reclamation of land for agriculture by converting marshland to upland was historically a common practice. Dikes were often built to allow for this shift in land change and to provide flood protection further inland. In recent times intertidal flats have also been reclaimed. For centuries, livestock such as sheep and cattle grazed on the highly fertile salt marsh land. Land reclamation for agriculture has resulted in many changes such as shifts in vegetation structure, sedimentation, salinity, water flow, biodiversity loss and high nutrient inputs. There have been many attempts made to eradicate these problems for example, in New Zealand, the cordgrass &quot;Spartina anglica&quot; was introduced from England into the Manawatū River mouth in 1913 to try and reclaim the estuary land for farming. A shift in structure from bare tidal flat to pastureland resulted from increased sedimentation and the cordgrass extended out into other estuaries around New Zealand. Native plants and animals struggled to survive as non-natives out competed them. Efforts are now being made to remove these cordgrass species, as the damages are slowly being recognized.

In the Blyth estuary in Suffolk in eastern England, the mid-estuary reclamations (Angel and Bulcamp marshes) that were abandoned in the 1940s have been replaced by tidal flats with compacted soils from agricultural use overlain with a thin veneer of mud. Little vegetation colonisation has occurred in the last 60–75 years and has been attributed to a combination of surface elevations too low for pioneer species to develop, and poor drainage from the compacted agricultural soils acting as an aquiclude. Terrestrial soils of this nature need to adjust from fresh to saline interstitial water by a change in the chemistry and the structure of the soil, accompanied with fresh deposition of estuarine sediment, before salt marsh vegetation can establish. The vegetation structure, species richness, and plant community composition of salt marshes naturally regenerated on reclaimed agricultural land can be compared to adjacent reference salt marshes to assess the success of marsh regeneration.

===Upstream agriculture===
Cultivation of land upstream from the salt marsh can introduce increased silt inputs and raise the rate of primary sediment accretion on the tidal flats, so that pioneer species can spread further onto the flats and grow rapidly upwards out of the level of tidal inundation. As a result, marsh surfaces in this regime may have an extensive cliff at their seaward edge. At the Plum Island estuary, Massachusetts (U.S.), stratigraphic cores revealed that during the 18th and 19th century the marsh prograded over subtidal and mudflat environments to increase in area from 6 km2 to 9 km2 after European settlers deforested the land upstream and increased the rate of sediment supply.

===Urban development and nitrogen loading===

The conversion of marshland to upland for agriculture has in the past century been overshadowed by conversion for urban development. Coastal cities worldwide have encroached onto former salt marshes and in the U.S. the growth of cities looked to salt marshes for waste disposal sites. Estuarine pollution from organic, inorganic, and toxic substances from urban development or industrialisation is a worldwide problem and the sediment in salt marshes may entrain this pollution with toxic effects on floral and faunal species. Urban development of salt marshes has slowed since about 1970 owing to growing awareness by environmental groups that they provide beneficial ecosystem services. They are highly productive ecosystems, and when net productivity is measured in g m−2 yr−1 they are equalled only by tropical rainforests. Additionally, they can help reduce wave erosion on sea walls designed to protect low-lying areas of land from wave erosion.

De-naturalisation of the landward boundaries of salt marshes from urban or industrial encroachment can have negative effects. In the Avon-Heathcote estuary/Ihutai, New Zealand, species abundance and the physical properties of the surrounding margins were strongly linked, and the majority of salt marsh was found to be living along areas with natural margins in the Avon / Ōtākaro and Ōpāwaho / Heathcote river outlets; conversely, artificial margins contained little marsh vegetation and restricted landward retreat. The remaining marshes surrounding these urban areas are also under immense pressure from the human population as human-induced nitrogen enrichment enters these habitats. Nitrogen loading through human-use indirectly affects salt marshes causing shifts in vegetation structure and the invasion of non-native species.

Human impacts such as sewage, urban run-off, agricultural and industrial wastes are running into the marshes from nearby sources. Salt marshes are nitrogen limited and with an increasing level of nutrients entering the system from anthropogenic effects, the plant species associated with salt marshes are being restructured through change in competition. For example, the New England salt marsh is experiencing a shift in vegetation structure where &quot;S. alterniflora&quot; is spreading from the lower marsh where it predominately resides up into the upper marsh zone. Additionally, in the same marshes, the reed &quot;Phragmites australis&quot; has been invading the area expanding to lower marshes and becoming a dominant species. &quot;P. australis&quot; is an aggressive halophyte that can invade disturbed areas in large numbers outcompeting native plants. This loss in biodiversity is not only seen in flora assemblages but also in many animals such as insects and birds as their habitat and food resources are altered.

===Sea level rise===
Due to the melting of Arctic sea ice and thermal expansion of the oceans, as a result of global warming, sea levels have begun to rise. As with all coastlines, this rise in water levels is predicted to negatively affect salt marshes, by flooding and eroding them. The sea level rise causes more open water zones within the salt marsh. These zones cause erosion along their edges, further eroding the marsh into open water until the whole marsh disintegrates.

While salt marshes are susceptible to threats concerning sea level rise, they are also an extremely dynamic coastal ecosystem. Salt marshes may in fact have the capability to keep pace with a rising sea level, by 2100, mean sea level could see increases between 0.6m to 1.1m. Marshes are susceptible to both erosion and accretion, which play a role in a what is called a bio-geomorphic feedback. Salt marsh vegetation captures sediment to stay in the system which in turn allows for the plants to grow better and thus the plants are better at trapping sediment and accumulate more organic matter. This positive feedback loop potentially allows for salt marsh bed level rates to keep pace with rising sea level rates. However, this feedback is also dependent on other factors like productivity of the vegetation, sediment supply, land subsidence, biomass accumulation, and magnitude and frequency of storms. In a study published by Ü. S. N. Best in 2018, they found that bioaccumulation was the number one factor in a salt marsh&#x27;s ability to keep up with SLR rates. The salt marsh&#x27;s resilience depends upon its increase in bed level rate being greater than that of sea levels&#x27; increasing rate, otherwise the marsh will be overtaken and drowned.

Biomass accumulation can be measured in the form of above-ground organic biomass accumulation, and below-ground inorganic accumulation by means of sediment trapping and sediment settling from suspension. Salt marsh vegetation helps to increase sediment settling because it slows current velocities, disrupts turbulent eddies, and helps to dissipate wave energy. Marsh plant species are known for their tolerance to increased salt exposure due to the common inundation of marshlands. These types of plants are called halophytes. Halophytes are a crucial part of salt marsh biodiversity and their potential to adjust to elevated sea levels. With elevated sea levels, salt marsh vegetation would likely be more exposed to more frequent inundation rates and it must be adaptable or tolerant to the consequential increased salinity levels and anaerobic conditions. There is a common elevation (above the sea level) limit for these plants to survive, where anywhere below the optimal line would lead to anoxic soils due to constant submergence and too high above this line would mean harmful soil salinity levels due to the high rate of evapotranspiration as a result of decreased submergence.
Along with the vertical accretion of sediment and biomass, the accommodation space for marsh land growth must also be considered. Accommodation space is the land available for additional sediments to accumulate and marsh vegetation to colonize laterally. This lateral accommodation space is often limited by anthropogenic structures such as coastal roads, sea walls and other forms of development of coastal lands. A study by Lisa M. Schile, published in 2014, found that across a range of sea level rise rates, marshlands with high plant productivity were resistant against sea level rises but all reached a pinnacle point where accommodation space was necessary for continued survival. The presence of accommodation space allows for new mid/high habitats to form, and for marshes to escape complete inundation.

===Mosquito control===
Earlier in the 20th century, it was believed that draining salt marshes would help reduce mosquito populations, such as &quot;Aedes taeniorhynchus&quot;, the black salt marsh mosquito. In many locations, particularly in the northeastern United States, residents and local and state agencies dug straight-lined ditches deep into the marsh flats. The end result, however, was a depletion of killifish habitat. The killifish is a mosquito predator, so the loss of habitat actually led to higher mosquito populations, and adversely affected wading birds that preyed on the killifish. These ditches can still be seen, despite some efforts to refill the ditches.

==Crab herbivory and bioturbation==

Increased nitrogen uptake by marsh species into their leaves can prompt greater rates of length-specific leaf growth, and increase the herbivory rates of crabs. The burrowing crab &quot;Neohelice granulata&quot; frequents SW Atlantic salt marshes where high density populations can be found among populations of the marsh species &quot;Spartina densiflora&quot; and &quot;Sarcocornia perennis&quot;. In Mar Chiquita lagoon, north of Mar del Plata, Argentina, &quot;Neohelice granulata&quot; herbivory increased as a likely response to the increased nutrient value of the leaves of fertilised &quot;Spartina densiflora&quot; plots, compared to non-fertilised plots. Regardless of whether the plots were fertilised or not, grazing by &quot;Neohelice granulata&quot; also reduced the length specific leaf growth rates of the leaves in summer, while increasing their length-specific senescence rates. This may have been assisted by the increased fungal effectiveness on the wounds left by the crabs.

The salt marshes of Cape Cod, Massachusetts (US), are experiencing creek bank die-offs of &quot;Spartina&quot; spp. (cordgrass) that has been attributed to herbivory by the crab &quot;Sesarma reticulatum&quot;. At 12 surveyed Cape Cod salt marsh sites, 10% – 90% of creek banks experienced die-off of cordgrass in association with a highly denuded substrate and high density of crab burrows. Populations of &quot;Sesarma reticulatum&quot; are increasing, possibly as a result of the degradation of the coastal food web in the region. The bare areas left by the intense grazing of cordgrass by &quot;Sesarma reticulatum&quot; at Cape Cod are suitable for occupation by another burrowing crab, &quot;Uca pugnax&quot;, which are not known to consume live macrophytes. The intense bioturbation of salt marsh sediments from this crab&#x27;s burrowing activity has been shown to dramatically reduce the success of &quot;Spartina alterniflora&quot; and &quot;Suaeda maritima&quot; seed germination and established seedling survival, either by burial or exposure of seeds, or uprooting or burial of established seedlings. However, bioturbation by crabs may also have a positive effect. In New Zealand, the tunnelling mud crab &quot;Helice crassa&quot; has been given the stately name of an &#x27;ecosystem engineer&#x27; for its ability to construct new habitats and alter the access of nutrients to other species. Their burrows provide an avenue for the transport of dissolved oxygen in the burrow water through the oxic sediment of the burrow walls and into the surrounding anoxic sediment, which creates the perfect habitat for special nitrogen cycling bacteria. These nitrate reducing (denitrifying) bacteria quickly consume the dissolved oxygen entering into the burrow walls to create the oxic mud layer that is thinner than that at the mud surface. This allows a more direct diffusion path for the export of nitrogen (in the form of gaseous nitrogen (N2)) into the flushing tidal water.

==Microbial life in salt marshes==
The variable salinity, climate, nutrient levels and anaerobic conditions of salt marshes provide strong selective pressures on the microorganisms inhabiting them. In salt marshes, microbes play the main role in nutrient cycling and biogeochemical processing. To date, the microbial community of salt marshes has not been found to change drastically due to human impacts, but the research is still ongoing. Because of the major role of microbes in these environments, it is critical to understand the different processes performed and different microbial players present in salt marshes. Salt marshes provide habitat for chemo(litho)autotrophs, heterotrophs, and photoautotrophs alike. These organisms contribute diverse environmental services such as sulfate reduction, nitrification, decomposition and rhizosphere interactions.

=== Chemo(litho)autotrophs in salt marshes ===
Chemoautotrophs, also known as chemolithoautotrophs, are organisms capable of creating their own energy, from the use of inorganic molecules, and are able to thrive in harsh environments, such as deep sea vents or salt marshes, due to not depending upon external organic carbon sources for their growth and survival. Some Chemoautotrophic bacterial microorganisms found in salt marshes include Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, both classes including sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB), and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) which play crucial roles in nutrient cycling and ecosystem functioning.

==== Abundance and diversity of sulfate-reducing chemolithoautotrophs ====
Bacterial chemolithoautotrophs in salt marshes include sulfate-reducing bacteria. In these ecosystems, up to 50% of sedimentary remineralization can be attributed to sulfate reduction. The dominant class of sulfate-reducing bacteria in salt marshes tends to be Deltaproteobacteria. Some examples of deltaproteobacteria that are found in salt marshes are species of genera &quot;Desulfobulbus&quot;, &quot;Desulfuromonas&quot;, and &quot;Desulfovibrio&quot;.

The abundance and diversity of chemolithoautotrophs in salt marshes is largely determined by the composition of plant species in the salt marsh ecosystem. Each type of salt-marsh plant has varying lengths of growing seasons, varying photosynthetic rates, and they all lose varying amounts of organic matter to the ocean, resulting in varying carbon-inputs to the ecosystem. The results from an experiment that was done in a salt marsh in the Yangtze estuary in China, suggested that both the species richness and total abundance of sulfate-reducing bacterial communities increased when a new plant, &quot;S. alterniflora&quot;, with a higher C-input to the ecosystem was introduced. Although chemolithotrophs produce their own carbon, they still depend on the C-input from salt marshes because of the indirect impact it has on the amount of viable electron donors, such as reduced sulfur compounds. The concentration of reduced sulfur compounds, as well as other possible electron donors, increases with more organic-matter decomposition (by other organisms). Therefore if the ecosystem contains more decomposing organic matter, as with plants with high photosynthetic and littering rates, there will be more electron donors available to the bacteria, and thus more sulfate reduction is possible. As a result, the abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria increases. The high-photosynthetic-rate, high-litter-rate salt marsh plant, &quot;S. alterniflora,&quot; was discovered to withstand high sulfur concentrations in the soil, which would normally be somewhat toxic to plants.

The abundance of chemolithoautotrophs in salt marshes also varies temporally as a result of being somewhat dependent on the organic C-input from plants in the ecosystem. Since plants grow most throughout the summer, and usually begin to lose biomass around fall during their late stage, the highest input of decomposing organic matter is in the fall. Thus seasonally, the abundance of chemolithotrophs in salt marshes is highest in autumn.

==== Why are sulfate-reducing bacteria in salt marshes? ====
Salt marshes are the ideal environment for sulfate-reducing bacteria. The sulfate-reducing bacteria tend to live in anoxic conditions, such as in salt marshes, because they require reduced compounds to produce their energy. Since there is a high sedimentation rate and a high amount of organic matter, the conditions of the sediment are usually dependably anoxic. However, the conditions all across the salt marsh (above the sediment) are not completely anoxic, which means the organisms living here must have some level of tolerance to oxygen. Many of the chemolithoautotrophs living outside or at the surface of the sediment also exhibit this characteristic.

==== Significance of sulfate-reducing bacteria ====
Sulfate-reducing bacteria play a significant role in nutrient recycling and in reducing nitrate pollution levels. Since humans have been adding disproportionate amounts of nitrates to coastal waters, salt marshes are one of the ecosystems where nitrate pollution remains an issue. The enrichment of nitrates in the water increases denitrification, as well as microbial decomposition and primary productivity. Sulfate-reducing and oxidizing bacteria, however, play a role in removing the excess nitrates from the water to prevent eutrophication. Since the sulfate-reducing bacteria is in the water and sediment, reduced sulfur molecules are usually in abundance. These reduced sulfates then react with excess nitrate in the water, reducing nitrate and oxidizing the reduced sulfur. As a result of human nitrate enrichment, it is predicted that sulfur-oxidizing bacteria which also reduce nitrates will increase in relative abundance to sulfur-reducing bacteria.

====Abundance and significance of chemolithoautotroph nitrifiers within salt marshes====
Within salt marshes, chemolithoautotrophic nitrifying bacteria are also frequently identified, including Betaproteobacteria ammonia oxidizers such as &quot;Nitrosomonas&quot; and &quot;Nitrosospira&quot;. Although ammonia-oxidizing Archaea (AOA) are found to be more prevalent than ammonium-oxidizing Bacteria (AOB) within salt marsh environments, predominantly from the Crenarchaeota group, AOB play a critical role within the salt marsh environment too. Increases in marsh salinity tend to favor AOB, while higher oxygen levels and lower carbon-to-nitrogen ratios favor AOA. These AOB are important in catalyzing the rate-limiting step within the nitrification process, by using ammonium monooxygenase (AMO), produced from &quot;amoA&quot;, to convert ammonium (NH4+) into nitrite (NO2-). Specifically, within the class of Betaproteobacteria, &quot;Nitrosomonas aestuarii,&quot; &quot;Nitrosomonas marina,&quot; and &quot;Nitrosospira ureae&quot; are highly prevalent within the salt marsh environment; similarly, within the class of Gammaproteobacteria, &quot;Nitrosococcus&quot; spp. are key AOB in the marshes.

The abundance of these chemolithoautotrophs varies along the salinity gradients present within salt marshes: &quot;Nitrosomonas&quot; are more prevalent within lower salinity or freshwater regions, while &quot;Nitrosospira&quot; are found to dominate in higher saline environments. In addition, the abundance of fixed-nitrogen in these environments critically influences the distribution of the betaproteobacteria within the salt marsh: &quot;Nitrosomonas&quot; are more found to be in greater abundance within high N and C environments, whereas &quot;Nitrosospira&quot; are found to be more abundant in lower N and C regions. Further, factors such as temperature, pH, net primary productivity, and regions of anoxia may limit nitrification, and thus critically influence nitrifier distribution.

The role of nitrification by AOB in salt marshes critically links ammonia, produced from the mineralization of organic nitrogen compounds, to the process of nitrogen oxidation. Further, nitrogen oxidation is important for the downstream removal of nitrates into nitrogen gas, catalyzed by denitrifiers, from the marsh environment. Hence, AOB play an indirect role in nitrogen removal into the atmosphere.  

=== Photoautotrophic bacteria ===
The bacterial photoautotroph community of salt marshes primarily consists of cyanobacteria, purple bacteria, and green sulfur bacteria.

==== Cyanobacteria in salt marshes ====
Cyanobacteria are important nitrogen fixers in salt marshes, and provide nitrogen to organisms like diatoms and microalgae.

==== Purple bacteria ====
Oxygen inhibits photosynthesis in purple bacteria, which makes estuaries a favorable habitat for them due to the low oxygen content and high levels of light present, optimizing their photosynthesis. In anoxic environments, like salt marshes, many microbes have to use sulfate as an electron acceptor during cellular respiration instead of oxygen, producing lots of hydrogen sulfide as a byproduct. While hydrogen sulfide is toxic to most organisms, purple bacteria require it to grow and will metabolize it to either sulfate or sulfur, and by doing so allowing other organisms to inhabit the toxic environment. Purple bacteria can be further classified as either purple sulphur bacteria, or purple non-sulfur bacteria. Purple sulphur bacteria are more tolerant to sulfide and store the sulfur they create intracellularly, while purple non-sulfur bacteria excrete any sulfur they produce.

==== Green bacteria ====
Green sulfur bacteria (&quot;Chlorobiaceae&quot;) are photoautotrophic bacteria that utilize sulfide and thiosulfate for their growth, producing sulfate in the process. They are very adapted to photosynthesizing in low light environments with bacteriochlorophyll pigments a, c, d, and e, to help them absorb wavelengths of light that other organisms cannot. When co-existing with purple bacteria, they often occupy lower depths as they are less tolerant to oxygen, but more photosynthetically adept.

=== Rhizosphere microbes ===

==== Fungi ====
Some mycorrhizal fungi, like arbuscular mycorrhiza are widely associated with salt marsh plants and may even help plants grow in salt marsh soil rich in heavy metals by reducing their uptake into the plant, although the exact mechanism has yet to be determined.

==== Bacteria ====
Examining 16S ribosomal DNA found in Yangtze River Estuary, the most common bacteria in the rhizosphere were Proteobacteria such as Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and Epsilonproteobacteria. One such widespread species had a similar ribotype to the animal pathogen S. marcescens, and may be beneficial for plants as the bacteria can break down chitin into available carbon and nitrogen for plants to use. Actinobacteria have also been found in plant rhizosphere in costal salt marshes and help plants grow through helping plants absorb more nutrients and secreting antimicrobial compounds. In Jiangsu, China, Actinobacteria from the suborders Pseudonocardineae, Corynebacterineae, Propionibacterineae, Streptomycineae, Micromonosporineae, Streptosporangineae and Micrococcineae were cultured and isolated from rhizosphere soil.

===Microbial decomposition activity within salt marshes===

Another key process among microbial salt marshes is microbial decomposition activity. Nutrient cycling in salt marshes is highly promoted by the resident community of bacteria and fungi involved in remineralizing organic matter. Studies on the decomposition of a salt marsh cordgrass, &quot;Spartina alterniflora&quot;, have shown that fungal colonization begins the degradation process, which is then finished by the bacterial community. The carbon from &quot;Spartina&quot; &quot;alterniflora&quot; is made accessible to the salt marsh food web largely through these bacterial communities which are then consumed by bacterivores. Bacteria are responsible for the degradation of up to 88% of lignocellulotic material in salt marshes. However, fungal populations have been found to dominate over bacterial populations in winter months.

The fungi that make up the decomposition community in salt marshes come from the phylum ascomycota, the two most prevalent species being &quot;Phaeosphaeria spartinicola&quot; and &quot;Mycosphaerella&quot; sp. strain 2. In terms of bacteria, the alphaproteobacteria class is the most prevalent class within the salt marsh environment involved in decomposition activity. The propagation of &quot;Phaeosphaeria spartinicola&quot; is through ascospores that are released when the host plant is wetted by high tides or rain.

==Restoration and management==

The perception of bay salt marshes as a coastal &#x27;wasteland&#x27; has since changed, acknowledging that they are one of the most biologically productive habitats on earth, rivalling tropical rainforests. Salt marshes are ecologically important, providing habitats for native migratory fish and acting as sheltered feeding and nursery grounds. They are now protected by legislation in many countries to prevent the loss of these ecologically important habitats. In the United States and Europe, they are now accorded a high level of protection by the Clean Water Act and the Habitats Directive respectively. With the impacts of this habitats and their importance now realised, a growing interest in restoring salt marshes through managed retreat or the reclamation of land has been established. However, many Asian countries such as China still need to recognise the value of marshlands. With their ever-growing populations and intense development along the coast, the value of salt marshes tends to be ignored and the land continues to be reclaimed.

Bakker et al. (1997) suggests two options available for restoring salt marshes. The first is to abandon all human interference and leave the salt marsh to complete its natural development. These types of restoration projects are often unsuccessful as vegetation tends to struggle to revert to its original structure and the natural tidal cycles are shifted due to land changes. The second option suggested by Bakker et al. (1997) is to restore the destroyed habitat into its natural state either at the original site or as a replacement at a different site. Under natural conditions, recovery can take 2–10 years or even longer depending on the nature and degree of the disturbance and the relative maturity of the marsh involved. Marshes in their pioneer stages of development will recover more rapidly than mature marshes as they are often first to colonize the land. It is important to note that restoration can often be sped up through the replanting of native vegetation.

This last approach is often the most practiced and generally more successful than allowing the area to naturally recover on its own. The salt marshes in the state of Connecticut in the United States have long been an area lost to fill and dredging. As of 1969, the Tidal Wetland Act was introduced that ceased this practice, but despite the introduction of the act, the system was still degrading due to alterations in tidal flow. One area in Connecticut is the marshes on Barn Island. These marshes were diked then impounded with salt and brackish marsh during 1946–1966. As a result, the marsh shifted to a freshwater state and became dominated by the invasive species &quot;P. australis&quot;, &quot;Typha angustifolia&quot; and &quot;T. latifolia&quot; that have little ecological connection to the area.

By 1980, a restoration programme was put in place that has now been running for over 20 years. This programme has aimed to reconnect the marshes by returning tidal flow along with the ecological functions and characteristics of the marshes back to their original state. In the case of Barn Island, reduction of the invasive species has been initiated, re-establishing the tidal-marsh vegetation along with animal species such as fish and insects. This example highlights that considerable time and effort is needed to effectively restore salt marsh systems. The timescale for salt marsh recovery is dependent on the development stage of the marsh, type and extent of the disturbance, geographical location and the environmental and physiological stress factors to the marsh-associated flora and fauna.

Although much effort has gone into restoring salt marshes worldwide, further research is needed. There are many setbacks and problems associated with marsh restoration that require careful long-term monitoring. Information on all components of the salt marsh ecosystem should be understood and monitored from sedimentation, nutrient, and tidal influences, to behaviour patterns and tolerances of both flora and fauna species. Once a better understanding of these processes is acquired, and not just locally, but over a global scale, then more sound and practical management and restoration efforts can be implemented to preserve these valuable marshes and restore them to their original state.

While humans are situated along coastlines, there will always be the possibility of human-induced disturbances despite the number of restoration efforts we plan to implement. Dredging, pipelines for offshore petroleum resources, highway construction, accidental toxic spills or just plain carelessness are examples that will for some time now and into the future be the major influences of salt marsh degradation.

In addition to restoring and managing salt marsh systems based on scientific principles, the opportunity should be taken to educate public audiences of their importance biologically and their purpose as serving as a natural buffer for flood protection. Because salt marshes are often located next to urban areas, they are likely to receive more visitors than remote wetlands. By physically seeing the marsh, people are more likely to take notice and be more aware of the environment around them. An example of public involvement occurred at the Famosa Slough State Marine Conservation Area in San Diego, where a &quot;friends&quot; group worked for over a decade in trying to prevent the area from being developed. Eventually, the site was bought by the city and the group worked together to restore the area. The project involved removing of invasive species and replanting with native ones, along with public talks to other locals, frequent bird walks and clean-up events.

==Research methods==
There is a diverse range and combination of methodologies employed to understand the hydrological dynamics in salt marshes and their ability to trap and accrete sediment. Sediment traps are often used to measure rates of marsh surface accretion when short term deployments (e.g. less than one month) are required. These circular traps consist of pre-weighed filters that are anchored to the marsh surface, then dried in a laboratory and re-weighed to determine the total deposited sediment.

For longer term studies (e.g. more than one year) researchers may prefer to measure sediment accretion with marker horizon plots. Marker horizons consist of a mineral such as feldspar that is buried at a known depth within wetland substrates to record the increase in overlying substrate over long time periods. In order to gauge the amount of sediment suspended in the water column, manual or automated samples of tidal water can be poured through pre-weighed filters in a laboratory then dried to determine the amount of sediment per volume of water.

Another method for estimating suspended sediment concentrations is by measuring the turbidity of the water using optical backscatter probes, which can be calibrated against water samples containing a known suspended sediment concentration to establish a regression relationship between the two. Marsh surface elevations may be measured with a stadia rod and transit, electronic theodolite, Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning System, laser level or electronic distance meter (total station). Hydrological dynamics include water depth, measured automatically with a pressure transducer, or with a marked wooden stake, and water velocity, often using electromagnetic current meters.

<doc id="265064" wikidata="Q7643228" url="?curid=265064" title="Supercritical water oxidation">
<text>Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) is a process that occurs in water at temperatures and pressures above a mixture&#x27;s thermodynamic critical point. Under these conditions water becomes a fluid with unique properties that can be used to advantage in the destruction of recalcitrant and hazardous wastes such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Supercritical water has a density between that of water vapor and liquid at standard conditions, and exhibits high gas-like diffusion rates along with high liquid-like collision rates. In addition, the behavior of water as a solvent is altered (in comparison to that of subcritical liquid water) - it behaves much less like a polar solvent. As a result, the solubility behavior is &quot;reversed&quot; so that oxygen, and organics such as chlorinated hydrocarbons become soluble in the water, allowing single-phase reaction of aqueous waste with a dissolved oxidizer. The reversed solubility also causes salts to precipitate out of solution, meaning they can be treated using conventional methods for solid-waste residuals. Efficient oxidation reactions occur at low temperature (400-650 °C) with reduced NOx production.

SCWO can be classified as green chemistry or as a clean technology. The elevated pressures and temperatures required for SCWO are routinely encountered in industrial applications such as petroleum refining and chemical synthesis.

A unique addition (mostly of academic interest) to the world of supercritical water (SCW) oxidation is generating high-pressure flames inside the SCW medium. The pioneer works on high-pressure supercritical water flames were carried out by professor EU Franck at the German University of Karlsruhe in the late 80s. The works were mainly aimed at anticipating conditions which would cause spontaneous generation of non-desirable flames in the flameless SCW oxidation process. These flames would cause instabilities to the system and its components. ETH Zurich pursued the investigation of hydrothermal flames in continuously operated reactors. The rising needs for waste treatment and destruction methods motivated a Japanese Group in the Ebara Corporation to explore SCW flames as an environmental tool. Research on hydrothermal flames has also begun at NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio.

== Basic research ==
Basic research on supercritical water oxidation was undertaken in the 1990s at Sandia National Laboratory&#x27;s Combustion Research Facility (CRF), in Livermore, CA. Originally proposed as a hazardous waste destruction technology in response to the Kyoto protocol, multiple waste streams were studied by Steven F. Rice and Russ Hanush, and hydrothermal (supercritical water) flames were investigated by Richard R. Steeper and Jason D. Aiken. Among the waste streams studied were military dyes and pyrotechnics, methanol, and isopropyl alcohol. Hydrogen peroxide was used as an oxidizing agent, and Eric Croiset was tasked with detailed measurements of the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide at supercritical water conditions.

In mid-1992, Thomas G. McGuinness, PE invented what is now known as the &quot;transpiring-wall SCWO reactor&quot; (TWR) while seconded to Los Alamos National Laboratory on behalf of Summit Research Corporation. McGuinness subsequently received the first US patent for a TWR in early 1995. The TWR was designed to mitigate problems of salt/solids deposition, corrosion and thermal limitations occurring in other SCWO reactor designs (eg. tubular &amp; vat-type reactors) at the time. The upper part of the vertical reactor incorporates a permeable liner through which a clean fluid permeates to help prevent salts and other solids from accumulating at the inner surface of the liner. The liner also insulates the outer pressure containment vessel from high temperatures within the reaction zone. The liner can be manufactured from a variety of materials resistant to corrosion and high reaction temperatures. The bottom end of the TWR incorporates a &quot;quench cooler&quot; for cooling the reaction byproducts while neutralizing any components that might form acids during transition to subcritical temperature. Proof-of-concept and performance advantages of the TWR for a variety of feedstocks was demonstrated by Eckhard Dinjus and Johannes Abeln at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FZK), via direct comparison between a TWR and an adjacent tubular reactor.

Major engineering challenges were associated with the deposition of salts and chemical corrosion in these supercritical water reactors. Anthony Lajeunesse led the team investigating these issues. To address these issues Lajeunesse designed a transpiring wall reactor which introduced a pressure differential through the walls of an inner sleeve filled with pores to continuously rinse the inner walls of the reactor with fresh water. Russ Hanush was charged with the construction and operation of the supercritical fluids reactor (SFR) used for these studies. Among its design intricacies were the Inconel 625 alloy necessary for operation at such extreme temperatures and pressures, and the design of the high-pressure, high-temperature optical cells used for photometric access to the reacting flows which incorporated 24 carat gold pressure seals and sapphire windows.

==Commercial applications==

Several companies in the United States are now working to commercialize supercritical reactors to destroy hazardous wastes. Widespread commercial application of SCWO technology requires a reactor design capable of resisting fouling and corrosion under supercritical conditions. 

In Japan a number of commercial SCWO applications exist, among them one unit for treatment of halogenated waste built by Organo. In Korea two commercial size units have been built by Hanwha. 

In Europe, Chematur Engineering AB of Sweden commercialized the SCWO technology for treatment of spent chemical catalysts to recover the precious metal, the AquaCat process. The unit has been built for Johnson Matthey in the UK. It is the only commercial SCWO unit in Europe and with its capacity of 3000l/h it is the largest SCWO unit in the world. Chematur&#x27;s Super Critical Fluids technology was acquired by SCFI Group (Cork, Ireland) who are actively commercializing the Aqua Critox SCWO process for treatment of sludge, e.g. de-inking sludge and sewage sludge. Many long duration trials on these applications have been made and thanks to the high destruction efficiency of 99.9%+ the solid residue after the SCWO process is well suited for recycling – in the case of de-inking sludge as paper filler and in the case of sewage sludge as phosphorus and coagulant. SCFI Group operate a 250l/h Aqua Critox demonstration plant in Cork, Ireland.

AquaNova Technologies, Inc. https://aquanovatech.com is actively commercializing their 2nd-generation transpiring-wall SCWO reactor (&quot;TWR&quot;) with a focus on waste treatment and renewable energy applications. AquaNova&#x27;s patent-pending TWR-SCWO technology is projected to treat a broad variety of wastes, including PFAS, while generating electric power with improved system thermal efficiency. AquaNova&#x27;s paradigm-changing technology is designed to operate at supercritical and sub-critical pressures, and at higher reaction temperatures than traditional SCWO technology. AquaNova is targeting larger-scale industrial applications. AquaNova Technologies was founded by Tom McGuinness, PE, who is the original inventor of the transpiring-wall reactor (TWR) under US patent 5,384,051.

374Water Inc. is a company offering commercial SCWO systems that convert organic wastes to clean water, energy and minerals. It is spun out after more than seven years of research and development funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to Prof. Deshusses laboratory based at Duke University. The founders of 374Water, Prof. Marc Deshusses and Kobe Nagar, possess the waste processing reactor patent relevant to SCWO. 374Water is actively commercializing its AirSCWO systems for the treatment of biosolids and wastewater sludges, organic chemical wastes, and PFAS wastes including unspent Aqueous Film Forming Foams (AFFFs), rinsates or spent resins and adsorption media. The first commercial sale was announced in February 2022. 

Aquarden Technologies (Skaevinge, Denmark) provides modular SCWO plants for the destruction of hazardous pollutants such as PFAS, pesticides, and other problematic hydrocarbons in industrial wastestreams. Aquarden is also providing remediation of hazardous energetic wastes and chemical warfare agents with SCWO, where a full-scale SCWO system has been operating for some years in France for the Defense Industry.

<text>Mexicali (; ) is the capital city of the Mexican state of Baja California. The city, which is the seat of the Mexicali Municipality, has a population of 689,775, according to the 2010 census, while the Calexico–Mexicali metropolitan area is home to 1,000,000 inhabitants on both sides of the Mexico–United States border. Mexicali is a regional economic and cultural hub for the border region of The Californias.

Mexicali was founded at the turn of the 20th century, when the region&#x27;s agricultural economy experienced a period of boom. The city rapidly expanded throughout the 20th century, owing to the proliferation of maquiladoras in the city, making the Mexicali economy more interconnected with businesses from across the border. Today, Mexicali is a major manufacturing center and an emerging tourist destination.

== History ==

The Spaniards arrived in the area after crossing the Sonoran Desert&#x27;s &quot;Camino del Diablo&quot; or Devil&#x27;s Road. This led to the evangelization of the area by Catholic missionaries and also to the reduction of native populations in the region. Nowadays, indigenous Cocopah people still inhabit a small government-protected corner of the Colorado River delta near the junction of the Hardy and the Colorado. The Cocopah mostly work on agricultural ejidos or fishing.

The early European presence in this area was limited to Anza&#x27;s and subsequent Spanish expeditions across the Colorado Desert and subsequent travelers on the Sonora Road opened by them. Also the presence of the Jesuits who attempted to establish a mission in what is now Fort Yuma. They left after a revolt by the Yuma in 1781. After this, the Spanish had little to do with the northeastern corner of the Baja California Peninsula, perceiving it as an untamable, flood-prone desert delta. Later in the 1820s, the Mexican authorities reopened the Sonoran Road and restored peaceful relations with the Yuma People.

===19th century===
In the mid-19th century, a geologist working for the Southern Pacific Railroad came to the delta area, discovering what the native Yumans had known for centuries: that the thick river sediment deposits made the area prime farming land. These sediments extended far to the west of the river itself, accumulating in a shallow basin below the Sierra de Cucapá. However, from this time period until the 1880s, the area was almost completely unpopulated, mostly due to its harsh climate. In 1888, the federal government granted a large part of northern Baja California state, including Mexicali, to Guillermo Andrade, with the purpose of colonizing the area on the recently created border with the United States. However, around 1900, the only area with any real population, aside from the Cocopah, were concentrated in Los Algodones, to the east of Mexicali.

===20th century===
In 1900, the U.S.-based California Development Company received permission from the government of Díaz to cut a canal through the delta&#x27;s Arroyo Alamo, to link the dry basin with the Colorado River. To attract farmers to the area, the developers named it the &quot;Imperial Valley&quot;. In 1903, the first 500 farmers arrived; by late 1904, 405 km2 (100,000 acres) of valley were irrigated, with 10,000 people settled on the land harvesting cotton, fruits, and vegetables. The concentration of small housing units that straddled the border was called Calexico on the U.S. side and Mexicali on the Mexican side. Led by &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; publisher Harry Chandler, one company controlled 800,000 hectares of land in northern Baja California by 1905, and began to build the irrigation system for the Valley. However, instead of using Mexican labor to dig the ditches, Chandler brought in thousands of Chinese laborers. Mexicali became culturally Chinese influenced.

The Mexican side was named Mexicali (a portmanteau composed of &quot;Mexico&quot; and &quot;California&quot;) by Coronel Agustín Sanguinéz. Initially the area belonged to the municipality of Ensenada. The town of Mexicali was officially created on 14 March 1903 when Manuel Vizcarra was named as the town&#x27;s first authority and Assistant Judge (&quot;juez auxiliar&quot;). On January 29, 1911, Mexicali was briefly &quot;liberated&quot; by the Liberal Party of Mexico during the Mexican Revolution. Mayor Baltazar Aviléz declared the municipality of Mexicali on November 4, 1914, and called for elections to creation of the first ayuntamiento or municipality, which was then headed by Francisco L. Montejano.

In the 20th century, the Colorado Riverland Company, a U.S.-based company, was dedicated to renting Mexican land to farmers; however, these farmers were almost always foreigners, such as Chinese, East Indians and Japanese. Mexicans were employed only as seasonal laborers. This situation led to the agrarian conflict known as the &quot;&quot; (Assault on the Lands) in 1937. in which Mexican land was taken by Mexicans.

Agricultural production continued to increase during the 20th century. Cotton became the most important crop and helped develop the textile industry. In the early 1950s, the Mexicali Valley became the biggest cotton-producing zone in the country and in the 1960s, production reached more than half a million parcels a year. 

The first factories appeared in the 1960s with the end of the Bracero program. A 1988 study found 100 factories in the city, including 10 electronics manufacturers, 25 auto parts manufacturers, 27 textile plants and nine plastics companies. Most maquiladoras are run by US companies, followed by Mexican, South Korean, and Japanese companies.

===21st century===
Today Mexicali is an important center for maquiladora (assembly plant) production in the automotive, aerospace, telecommunications, metallurgical, and health items as well as manufacturing and exporting products to various countries.

The 2010 Baja California earthquake occurred on Easter Sunday about south-southeast of Mexicali. This very large magnitude 7.2 earthquake occurred at 15:40:40 local time (UTC−8) according to the U.S. Geological Survey. With a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (&quot;Very strong&quot;), it was felt in northern Baja California near the United States–Mexico border, and was also felt in western cities such as Tijuana, San Diego, Los Angeles and parts of Arizona.

==Geography==

The Mexicali Valley is one of the largest and most fertile valleys in Mexico. Over fifty different crops are grown in the valley, which is similar in production to the Imperial Valley. National and international industries have invested in Mexicali and surrounding cities to take advantage of its tax-free status given to industry. The Mexicali Valley is a primary source of water for the region, which is the largest irrigation district in Mexico.

A study by Instituto Mexicano de la Competitividad has listed Mexicali as Mexico&#x27;s most polluted air of large cities, with a PM10 rating of 137 for the year 2010. It is thought that the reason is lack of pavement (dust) and lack of wind, especially in summer. The city is grappling with huge amounts of trash &quot;from old appliances, to electronic waste and used tires, some of which comes from the United States.&quot; Mexican government agencies in the border region have not made pollution a priority, and weak enforcement of environmental standards is considered a reason that multinationals locate factories there, along with low wages. In general, maquiladoras are supposed to return any toxic waste to its country of origin, but in some cases it can be handled in Mexico.

===Ecology===
Despite its arid desert location, Mexicali is watered through a system of aquifers in the valley. Under a 1944 water treaty, the city is &quot;guaranteed an annual quantity of [of water] to be delivered&quot; from the Colorado River. However, a proposed concrete lining in the United States on the All-American Canal would cut off billions of leaked gallons of water, which is used to irrigate onions, alfalfa, asparagus, squash and other crops in Mexicali.

The nearby Cerro Prieto volcano is adjacent to the Cerro Prieto Geothermal Power Station, which creates high volumes of pollutants including mercury. As of 2014, the government are creating a zone of exclusion, due to the alarming amount of pollutants and contamination that has permeated throughout miles around the geothermal plant of Cerro Prieto.

===Climate===
Because of its low annual precipitation, Mexicali has a hot arid climate (&quot;BWh&quot;), featuring long, extremely hot summers and mild to warm winters. Under the criteria for the Köppen climate classification, Mexicali maintains desert weather temperatures every year, receiving only of precipitation annually over 16 precipitation days on average. On December 12, 1932, the city experienced snowfall. Rainfall usually occurs in the winter months of December, January and February. Summer rainfall in the city is infrequent, although in some years thunderstorms and the remnants of tropical storms and hurricanes passing over Baja California from the Pacific can sometimes drop heavy rainfall (most likely in August and September). A notable example was Hurricane Kathleen in 1976, which dropped several inches of rain in the area. During winter time, Mexicali is affected by the snow storms that pass by the town of La Rumorosa located in the Sierra de Juárez, about 45 minutes west of the city, causing a decrease in temperature that lasts from two days to one week. July is the hottest month with a mean at and an average high at , while January is the coolest month with a mean at and an average low at .

On 28 July 1995, the Mexicali area recorded a temperature of , which is the highest temperature ever recorded in Mexico. 

==Demographics==
As of 2020, the city of Mexicali had a population of 854,186.

The city itself had a 2005 census population of 653,046, whereas the municipality&#x27;s population was 895,962. It is the 13th largest municipality in Mexico as of the Census 2005 with population estimates exceeding one million alone. 

The population is constantly growing due to the number of maquiladoras in the area, lack of urban planning, and migrational aspects, like seasonal labor and the constant in-and-out flow of immigrants to the U.S. or into Mexico.

==Economy==
Mexicali&#x27;s economy has been historically based on agricultural products, and they remain a large sector of the economy. However, its economy has gradually gone from being agricultural to include industry, mainly maquiladoras—duty-free factories in which parts from the United States are imported, assembled, and then returned to the United States as finished products. Currently, the Mexicali Valley still is one of Mexico&#x27;s most productive agricultural regions, mostly producing wheat, cotton and vegetables. The city is one of Mexico&#x27;s most important exporters of asparagus, broccoli, carrots, green onions, lettuce, peas, peppers, radishes and tomatoes to the world. 
In its beginnings Mexicali was an important center for cotton production for export, until synthetic fabrics reduced the worldwide demand for the fiber. Currently, horticulture is the most successful agricultural activity with scallion (green onion), and asparagus being among the most important crops. Cotton and wheat are still grown, but low government price guarantees and subsidies make wheat farmer protests an annual event. There is an annual agri-business fair, which if unfunded by the government, would have been dead a decade ago, named AGROBAJA, Agrobaja in March of every year, drawing people by the thousands, from all over Mexico and before the crisis, from the United States.

The current prospects for economic growth in Mexicali rely on in-bond and assembly plants (maquiladoras), which come due to low wages and loose worker right laws, include companies like, Selther, Daewoo Electronics, Mitsubishi, Honeywell, Paccar, Vitro, Skyworks Solutions, CareFusion, Bosch, Price Pfister, Gulfstream, United Technologies Corporation, Kenworth, Kwikset and Collins Aerospace. Mexicali is also home to many food processing plants such as Nestlé, Jumex, Bimbo, Coca-Cola, Kellogg&#x27;s, and Sabritas. In December 2018 there were 180 in all, employing 70,000 people.

Mexicali became the national center for the aerospace industry in Mexico when Rockwell Collins established an operation there in 1966. Rockwell Collins is the oldest company under the maquiladora program nationwide.

===Silicon Border===
Silicon Border is an empty development supposedly tailored to the specific needs of high-technology manufacturing and is situated in the outskirts of Mexicali, along the western border of the U.S. and Mexico. The aim of the empty manufacturing park, which began in 2004, was to transform Mexicali into the world&#x27;s next semiconductor manufacturing center, if the world economy was fine. The Mexican federal and Baja California state governments have given away $2 million of public money to private hands, without a referendum for the design of the project and the laying of a few streets and lamp posts that can be seen on the premises as the only work done. Neither authorities nor the private frontmen of the project have given the public any account on what the public money was spent on. Former president Vicente Fox offered ten years of a tax rate as low as 3% to foreign-owned factories.

The premises sit empty as of October 2022.

===Tourism===

Mexicali also relies on tourism as a medium to generate revenue, and visitors cross by foot or by car from Calexico, United States, every day. Tourists are mainly attracted to local taco stands, restaurants, pharmacies, bars and dance clubs. Near the border, in walking distance, there are many shops and stalls selling Mexican curios and souvenirs. Arizona and Nevada residents look for medical and dental services in Mexicali, since they tend to be less expensive than in the United States. Pharmacies sell some drugs without a prescription and at much lower cost than in the US, but some medications still require a doctor&#x27;s prescription, although several accessible doctor offices are located near the border as well.

Mexico&#x27;s drinking age is 18 years old (vs. 21 in the United States) which makes it a common weekend destination for many high school and college students from Southern California.

Mexicali hosts Baja Prog, one of the world&#x27;s most important events in progressive rock.

Mexicali hosts four main shopping malls, the most visited being Plaza La Cachanilla, located a mile away from the US border. The mall hosts a variety of shops, which sell a wide array of items, ranging from cheap Mexican curios to expensive imports. The Plaza La Cachanilla also represents a common place for people to socialize, especially during summer days when the weather reaches high temperatures, many families come and spend the day inside the air-conditioned mall.

For recreation, Mexicali has bath halls, bowling alleys, traditional cantinas, car clubs, strip clubs, movie theaters, museums, a zoo, a convention center, supermarkets, and fast food restaurants for every choice of food.

Galerias del Valle, holds a WalMart Supercenter, a twelve-screen Cinepolis movie theater, two casinos, a food court, and a large array of stores that sell many items needed for daily living. It is located on Boulevard Lázaro Cárdenas at Calle 11.

==Education==
According to a previous census conducted by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) in 2008, the number of students who have graduated from Mexicali&#x27;s public and private schools are as follows:

Pre-scholar students: 18,648&lt;br&gt;Primary school students: 17,272&lt;br&gt;Secondary school students: 12,337&lt;br&gt;Technical education students: 531&lt;br&gt;Baccalaureate students: 6,152

Some public universities in the city include Autonomous University of Baja California, Mexicali, Universidad Politécnica de Baja California and the Mexicali Institute of Technology. Private universities include Centro de Enseñanza Técnica y Superior, University of the Valley of Mexico and Xochicalco University.

==Culture==

The residents of Mexicali (&quot;Mexicalenses&quot;) call themselves &quot;Cachanillas&quot; (due to a local plant, the cachanilla, used by the Cucapah tribe to build shacks) and are from culturally diverse backgrounds. It is among the most ethnically diverse cities in Mexico, with people from various Native American, European, African, East Asian, and Middle Eastern origins.

There is a very popular song called &quot;&quot; also known as &quot;El Cachanilla&quot; that identifies people from Mexicali. This song was originally recorded in 1963 by the ranchero singer Caín Corpus and written by the famous mexican composer .
In 2004, there were 8 theaters in the city: Teatro del Estado, Teatro de Casa de Cultura de Mexicali. Idem, Teatro del CREA, Teatro Universitario de Mexicali, Teatro al Aire Libre de Rectoría, Teatro del Seguro Social, and Centro Estatal de las Artes.

Mexicali also has the Baja Prog festival, a series of progressive rock concerts that take place during four consecutive days in springtime. It is hosted by CAST, a progressive rock band from Mexicali.

===La Chinesca===

The city claimed to have the largest per capita concentration of residents of Chinese origin in Mexico, around 5,000 until 2012 when the Tijuana La Mesa District surpassed that number at 15,000 Chinese immigrants. The Chinese immigrants came to the area as laborers for the Colorado River Land Company, an American enterprise which designed and built an extensive irrigation system in the Valley of Mexicali. Some immigrants came from the United States, often fleeing anti-Chinese policies there, while others sailed directly from China. Thousands of Chinese were lured to the area by the promise of high wages, but that never materialized.

Since 2000, new migrants from China to Mexicali come from many of the same areas as before 1960, with perhaps 90% from Guangdong or Hong Kong.

==Sports==

Mexicali has many sites visited by people from across the country, as well as by visitors from the U.S. and Canada, such as the bullfighting arena, Plaza Calafia, where one or two bullfights are held yearly. Mexicali also has a professional 18-hole golf course, Club Campestre, where both national and international championships have taken place.

The city&#x27;s professional basketball team is Soles de Mexicali of the Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional (LNBP). Soles lifted the national trophy as the 2006–07, 2014–15, 2017–18, and 2019–20 LNBP Champions. Their stadium, the Auditorio del Estado, is located in Ciudad Deportiva de Mexicali. The &quot;Bomberos de Mexicali&quot; were founded in 2010 and participated in the Pacific Coast Basketball Circuit, CIBACOPA. Another defunct franchise, Calor de Mexicali (Mexicali Heat), participated in the 2007 edition of the league. They played their home games at the Gimnasio de Mexicali located on Avenida Reforma. Mexicali was also home to a 2006 American Basketball Association franchise, the Centinelas de Mexicali (The Sentinels).

Ciudad Deportiva houses a football stadium where Mexicali Fútbol Club in the Mexican Second Division and &quot;Cachanillas de Mexicali&quot;, a Mexican Third Division team plays. The home of the Pioneros del Valle, also a Mexican third division football team, is located in the Mexicali Valley.

In addition, Ciudad Deportiva is the location of Farmacias Sta Maria formally known as Estadio B&#x27;Air, where the Águilas de Mexicali play, competing in winter baseball&#x27;s Mexican Pacific League (LMP). The Centinelas de Mexicali are a professional team which plays in the North Sonora League, the main development league for the LMP. Young Mexicali baseball players have played in the Little League World Series five times; first in 1985, with the Félix Arce Little League representing the United States West region, and then in 2005, 2007, 2011 and 2015 the Seguro Social Little League representing Mexicali.

==Transportation==

Mexicali is located at a Junction of major interstates and federal highways. These include Interstate 8, leading from San Diego to the Arizona Sun Corridor where the cities of Phoenix and Tucson dominate, Federal Highway 2, which leads east to San Luis Río Colorado and west to Tijuana, and Federal Highway 5 connecting San Felipe with Mexicali. Other roads lead southwest to Ensenada or north to the Imperial Valley.

The road system in the city of Mexicali and its conurbation is very complex. Over the urban area long boulevards are traversed from one end of which most are 6 lanes with a median of 2 lanes. The backbone of the city is the Lazaro Cardenas Boulevard extending from east to west. Other important boulevards include: Adolfo Lopez Mateos, Benito Juárez, Anáhuac, Justo Sierra, Venustiano Carranza, Manuel Gómez Morin, Francisco L. Montejano, Cetys, Héctor Terán Terán, Independencia and Heroico Colegio Militar, among others. There are two corridors within the city: New River Ecological Corridor, which is guided in the ancient New River bed, and the Palaco Industrial Corridor, this crosses the southern Industrial zone of Mexicali. There is also the beltway, located in the east of the city, connecting the Lazaro Cardenas Blvd. with Islas Agrarias Blvd. and the road to Colonia Abasolo, and this in turn with the Airport Road.

===Airport===

The city is linked to other Mexican cities by Mexicali International Airport, which serves the city and the surrounding towns.

<doc id="265070" wikidata="Q2986212" url="?curid=265070" title="Commentaries on the Laws of England">
<text>The Commentaries on the Laws of England (commonly, but informally known as Blackstone&#x27;s Commentaries) are an influential 18th-century treatise on the common law of England by Sir William Blackstone, originally published by the Clarendon Press at Oxford between 1765 and 1769. The work is divided into four volumes, on the rights of persons, the rights of things, of private wrongs and of public wrongs.

The &quot;Commentaries&quot; were long regarded as the leading work on the development of English law and played a role in the development of the American legal system. They were in fact the first methodical treatise on the common law suitable for a lay readership since at least the Middle Ages. The common law of England has relied on precedent more than statute and codifications and has been far less amenable than the civil law, developed from the Roman law, to the needs of a treatise. The &quot;Commentaries&quot; were influential largely because they were in fact readable, and because they met a need. As such, they were used in the training of American and British lawyers long after the death of Blackstone.

The &quot;Commentaries&quot; are often quoted as the definitive pre-Revolutionary source of common law by United States courts. Opinions of the Supreme Court of the United States quote from Blackstone&#x27;s work whenever they wish to engage in historical discussion that goes back that far, or farther (for example, when discussing the intent of the Framers of the Constitution). The book was famously used as the key in Benedict Arnold&#x27;s Arnold cipher, which he used to communicate secretly with his conspirator John André during their plot to betray the Continental Army during the American Revolution.

==Publication history==

In 1765 Blackstone announced his resignation from the Vinerian Chair, effective after his 1766 lectures. These were divided into two 14-lecture series, on &quot;private wrongs&quot; and &quot;public wrongs&quot; delivered between 12 February and 24 April. At this point Blackstone had published nothing new since &quot;A Treatise on the Law of Descents in Fee Simple&quot; in 1759. The decision to resign was most likely due to the increasing demands of his legal practice and the reduced profit from the lectures, which, after peaking at £340 in 1762, dropped to £239 a year later and to £203 for the final round of lectures in 1765–66.

In response, Blackstone decided to publish a new book – &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot;. The first volume was published in November 1765, bringing the author £1,600; the full work would eventually bring in over £14,000. Owen Ruffhead described Volume I as &quot;masterly&quot;, noting that &quot;Mr Blackstone is perhaps the first who has treated the body of the law in a liberal, elegant and constitutional manner. A vein of good sense and moderation runs through every page&quot;. Every copy was sold within six months, and the second and third volumes, published in October 1766 and June 1768, received a similar reception. The fourth and final volume appeared in 1769, dealing with criminal law. With the financial success of the &quot;Commentaries&quot;, Blackstone moved in 1768 from his London property in Carey Fields to No. 55 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields. Neighbours included the Sardinian ambassador, Sir Walter Rawlinson, Lord Northington, John Morton and the Third Earl of Abingdon, making it an appropriate house for a &quot;great and able Lawyer&quot;.

Blackstone&#x27;s treatise was republished in 1770, 1773, 1774, 1775, 1778 and in a posthumous edition in 1783. Reprints of the first edition, intended for practical use rather than antiquary interest, were published until the 1870s in England and Wales, and a working version by Henry John Stephen, first published in 1841, was reprinted until after the Second World War. The first American edition was produced in 1772; prior to this, over 1,000 copies had already been sold in the Thirteen Colonies.

==Contents==
===The Rights of Persons===
The Rights of Persons is the first volume in the four part series that is the Commentaries. Divided into 18 chapters, it is largely concerned with the rights of individuals; the rights of Parliament; the rights and title of the ; the royal family; the councils belonging to the King; kingly duties; the royal prerogative; the King&#x27;s revenue; subordinate magistrates; the people (aliens, denizens, and natives); the rights of the clergy; the civil state; the military and maritime states; the relationship between master and servant (in modern-day terminology, employer and employee), husband and wife, parent and child, guardian and ward; and finally corporates.

===The Rights of Things===
The Rights of Things, Blackstone&#x27;s longest volume, deals with property. The vast majority of the text is devoted to real property, this being the most valuable sort in the feudal law upon which the English law of land was founded. Property in chattels was already beginning to overshadow property in land, but its law lacked the complex feudal background of the common law of land, and was not dealt with nearly as extensively by Blackstone.

===Of Private Wrongs===
Of Private Wrongs dealt with torts as they existed in Blackstone&#x27;s time. The various methods of trial that existed at civil law were also dealt with in this volume, as were the jurisdictions of the several courts, from the lowest to the highest. Almost as an afterthought, Blackstone also adds a brief chapter on equity, the parallel legal system that existed in English law at the time, seeking to address wrongs that the common law did not handle.

===Of Public Wrongs===
Of Public Wrongs is Blackstone&#x27;s treatise on criminal law. Here, Blackstone the apologist takes centre stage; he seeks to explain how the criminal laws of England were just and merciful, despite becoming later known as the Bloody Code for their severity. He does however accept that &quot;It is a melancholy truth, that among the variety of actions which men are daily liable to commit, no less than an hundred and sixty have been declared by Act of Parliament to be felonious without benefit of clergy; or, in other words, to be worthy of instant death&quot;. Blackstone frequently resorted to assuring his reader that the laws as written were not always enforced, and that the King&#x27;s power of pardon could be exercised to correct any hardships or injustices.

==Legacy==
Blackstone for the first time made the common law readable and understandable by non-lawyers. At first, his &quot;Commentaries&quot; were hotly contested, some seeing in them an evil or covert attempt to reduce or codify the common law which was anathema to common law purists.

For decades, a study of the &quot;Commentaries&quot; was required reading for all first year law students. Lord Avonmore said of Blackstone: &quot;He it was who first gave to the law the air of a science. He found it a skeleton and clothed it with life, colour and complexion. He embraced the cold statue and by his touch, it grew into youth, health and beauty.&quot; Jeremy Bentham, who had been a critic of the &quot;Commentaries&quot; when they were first published, credits Blackstone with having &quot;taught jurisprudence to speak the language of the scholar and the gentleman; put a polish upon that rugged science, cleansed her from the dust and cobwebs of the office and, if he has not enriched her with that precision which is drawn only from the sterling treasury of the sciences, has decked her out to advantage from the toilet of classical erudition, enlivened her with metaphors and allusions and sent her abroad in some measure to instruct.&quot;

While there is much valuable historical information in the &quot;Commentaries&quot;, later historians have tended to be somewhat critical of the uses Blackstone made of history. the easy and contradictory assurance that England&#x27;s current political settlement represented the optimal state of rational and just government, while claiming simultaneously that this optimal state was an ideal that had always existed in the past, despite the many struggles in England&#x27;s history between overreaching kings and wayward parliaments.

But Blackstone&#x27;s chief contribution was to create a succinct, readable, and above all &quot;handy&quot; epitome of the common law tradition. While &quot;useful&quot; in England, Blackstone&#x27;s text answered an urgent need in the developing United States and Canada. In the United States, the common law tradition was being spread into frontier areas, but it was not feasible for lawyers and judges to carry around the large libraries that contained the common law precedents. The four volumes of Blackstone put the gist of that tradition in portable form. (A modern paperback printing of the four volumes total about 1500 pages.) They were required reading for most lawyers in the Colonies, and for many, they were the only reading. 

Two decades after their publication, Blackstone&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries&quot; were the focus of a mocking polemic by Jeremy Bentham, called &quot;Fragment on Government&quot;. This dissection of Blackstone&#x27;s first book made Bentham&#x27;s name notorious, though it was originally published anonymously.

In 1841–1845, Henry John Stephen published &quot;New Commentaries on the Laws of England (Partly Founded on Blackstone)&quot;, whose structure was modelled on Blackstone&#x27;s work and which liberally quoted from it; much of Blackstone&#x27;s text remained as late as 1914 in the 16th edition of &quot;Stephen&#x27;s Commentaries&quot;; in 1922 under Edward Jenks most of the text was rewritten but the structure was realigned more closely to Blackstone&#x27;s original.
