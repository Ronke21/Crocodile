<text>Ion Constantin Brătianu (; June 2, 1821 – May 16, 1891) was one of the major political figures of 19th-century Romania. He was the son of Dincă Brătianu and the younger brother of Dimitrie, as well as the father of Ionel, Dinu, and Vintilă Brătianu. He also was the grandfather of poet Ion Pillat.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born to wealthy boyars based in Pitești, the main town of Argeș region in the Principality of Wallachia, he entered the Wallachian Army in 1838, and in 1841 started studying in Paris. Returning to his native land, Brătianu took part, with his friend C. A. Rosetti and other young politicians including his brother, in the 1848 Wallachian Revolution, and acted as police prefect in the provisional government formed that year.

The restoration of Russian and Ottoman authority shortly afterwards drove him into exile. He took refuge in Paris and endeavoured to influence French opinion in favor of the proposed union and autonomy of the Romanian Danubian Principalities. In 1854, however, he was sentenced to a fine and three months&#x27; imprisonment for sedition and later confined in a lunatic asylum; in 1856, he returned to Wallachia with his brother – afterwards one of his foremost political opponents.

===Under Cuza and in the opposition===

As a member of the National Party or &quot;Partida Naţională&quot;, he was in favor of the union of the Danubian Principalities, Wallachia&#x27;s and Moldavia. In 1875, during the reign of Alexander Ioan Cuza (r. 1859–1866), Brătianu founded the National Liberal Party (PNL), which became a major political formation until the Communist takeover and again after the 1989 overthrow of their regime. Opposition to the land reform united the emerging Liberals and Conservatives against the &quot;Domnitor&quot; (ruling prince) and his inner circle. Both parties comprised mainly landowners who allied to block legislation in the Chamber, causing Cuza to impose an authoritarian government in May 1864. The two-party alliance, remembered as &quot;the monstrous coalition&quot;, opted for the removal of Cuza. Brătianu took part in the deposition of 1866 and in the subsequent election of Prince Carol of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, under whom he held several ministerial appointments throughout the next four years.

Nonetheless, his very sinuous relationship with the new Prince was the source of several crisis situations. Notably, Brătianu would point to the benefits of a Republican project (which Rosetti and his left wing of the Liberal Party had never ceased advocating). Thus, when the experimental Republic of Ploiești was created in 1870 around a Liberal group, Ion Brătianu was arrested as the inspirational figure, but was soon released.

In 1871, the Liberals organized protests in favor of France – just defeated in the Franco-Prussian War – and implicitly against the German Empire, the Conservatives, and Prince Carol himself. The weight of the moment showed the weaknesses of the Liberals, as well as Carol&#x27;s resolution: the Prince called on Lascăr Catargiu to form a stable and reliable government. The change in tactics forced the Liberals to form their loose tendency as a real party in 1875. Alongside several liberal tenets, the new formation took a further step towards advocating protectionism and persecution of Jewish Romanians (see History of the Jews in Romania). In 1876, aided by C. A. Rosetti, Brătianu formed a Liberal cabinet, which remained in power until 1888; this marked his coming to terms with Carol.

===Prominence===

The government took steps at taking the country out of its Ottoman vassalage; however, it differed from Conservatives in that they saw the main threat posed to Romania in Austria-Hungary. Liberals were of the generation that had truly brought Romanians in Transylvania to the country&#x27;s attention; on the other hand, Catargiu had signed an agreement with the Austrian Monarchy that awarded it commercial privilege in Romania – while quieting its suspicion towards Romanian irredentism. Brătianu&#x27;s government did not disturb this climate after the Russian alliance proved unsatisfactory, and the two parties resorted to assisting Romanian cultural ventures in Transylvania (until World War I).

He aligned the country with Russia as soon as the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 began, which included a campaign against Ottoman strongholds south of the Danube known in Romania as the Romanian War of Independence. While Romania did emancipate itself from Ottoman tutelage, Brătianu, who remained as the head of a second cabinet in 1878-79, had to accommodate a prolonged Russian occupation, and the Congress of Berlin saw Russia seizing Southern Bessarabia, the only part of Bessarabia still under Romanian control (Romania was awarded Northern Dobruja in return). After the war, the Principality of Bulgaria appeared and began a search for a prince. According to Nikolay Pavlovich Ignatyev, Brătianu supported the election of Prince Carol I as monarch of Bulgaria. Ignatyev said the intention of the Romanian officials was to establish a personal union with Bulgaria. In 1881, Romania proclaimed itself a Kingdom.

The Congress also pressured the Liberals to discard the discrimination policies, and the government agreed to allow Jews and Dobrujan Muslims to apply for citizenship (with a 10-year probation), but continued forbidding foreign-born people or non-citizens from owning land. However, he had anti-Semitic views, publishing a lot of discriminatory laws, being responsible for the exile of various Jewish Romanian intellectuals. The most famous Jewish intellectual exiled by Brătianu was Moses Gaster, at the initiative of Dimitrie A. Sturdza.

The Brătianu government introduced most modern reforms in the administrative, educational, economical, and military fields. It celebrated its main success in 1883, when the Liberals managed to have the 1866 Constitution of Romania amended – enlarging the number of electors and establishing a third electoral college, one that gave some representation to peasants and the urban employees. The move was not radical, and it served to obtain the Liberals political ascendancy: the very first elections under the new law brought them an overwhelming majority.

In 1886, after a meeting with Carol I and the Bulgarian prince Alexander of Battenberg, Brătianu informed the Bulgarian diplomat Grigor Nachovich that Alexander had requested a Balkan confederation under the leadership of Carol I. This turned out to be a misunderstanding.

After 1883 Brătianu acted as sole leader of the party, owing to a quarrel with Rosetti, his friend and political ally for nearly forty years. His long tenure of office, without parallel in Romanian history, rendered Brătianu extremely unpopular, and at its close his impeachment appeared inevitable. But any proceedings taken against the minister would have involved charges against the king, who was largely responsible for his policy, and the impeachment was averted by a vote of parliament in February 1890.

===Other activities===
Besides being the leading statesman of Romania during the critical years 1876–1888, Brătianu attained some eminence as a writer. His French language political pamphlets, &quot;Mémoire sur l&#x27;empire d&#x27;Autriche dans la question d&#x27;Orient&quot; (&quot;Account of the Austrian Empire in the Oriental Issue&quot;, 1855), &quot;Réflexions sur la situation&quot; (&quot;Musings on the Situation&quot;, 1856), &quot;Mémoire sur la situation de la Moldavie depuis le traité de Paris&quot; (&quot;Account on Moldavia&#x27;s Situation After the Treaty of Paris&quot;, 1857), and &quot;La Question religieuse en Roumanie&quot; (&quot;The Religious Issue in Romania&quot;, 1866), were all published in Paris.

<doc id="264036" wikidata="Q60291" url="?curid=264036" title="Peter Kürten">
<text>Peter Kürten (; 26 May 1883 – 2 July 1931) was a German serial killer, known as The Vampire of Düsseldorf and the Düsseldorf Monster, who committed a series of murders and sexual assaults between February and November 1929 in the city of Düsseldorf. In the years before these assaults and murders, Kürten had amassed a lengthy criminal record for offences including arson and attempted murder. He also confessed to the 1913 murder of a nine-year-old girl in Mülheim am Rhein and the attempted murder of a 17-year-old girl in Düsseldorf.

Described by as &quot;the king of the sexual perverts&quot;, Kürten was found guilty of nine counts of murder and seven counts of attempted murder for which he was sentenced to death by beheading in April 1931. He was executed via guillotine in July 1931, at age 48.

Kürten became known as the &quot;Vampire of Düsseldorf&quot; because he occasionally made attempts to drink the blood from his victims&#x27; wounds; and the &quot;Düsseldorf Monster&quot; both because the majority of his murders were committed in and around the city of Düsseldorf, and due to the savagery he inflicted upon his victims&#x27; bodies.

==Early life==
===Childhood===
Peter Kürten was born into a poverty-stricken, abusive family in Mülheim am Rhein on 26 May 1883, the oldest of thirteen children (two of whom died at an early age). Kürten&#x27;s parents were both alcoholics who lived in a one-bedroom apartment, and Kürten&#x27;s father frequently beat his wife and children, particularly when he was drunk. When intoxicated, Kürten&#x27;s father often forced his wife and children to assemble before him before ordering his wife to strip naked and have sex with him as his children watched. He was jailed for eighteen months in 1897 for repeatedly raping his eldest daughter, who was aged 13. Shortly thereafter, Kürten&#x27;s mother obtained a separation order, and later remarried and relocated to Düsseldorf.

In 1888, Kürten attempted to drown one of his playmates. Four years later, he befriended a local dog-catcher who lived in the same building as his family and began accompanying him on his rounds. This individual often tortured and killed the animals he caught, and Kürten soon became an active and willing participant in torturing the animals.

Being the eldest surviving son, Kürten was the target of much of his father&#x27;s physical abuse and frequently refused to return home from school as a result. Although he was a good student, he later recollected his academic performance suffered due to the extensive physical violence he endured. From an early age, Kürten often ran away from home for periods of time ranging from days to weeks. Much of the time Kürten spent on the streets was in the company of petty criminals and social misfits. Via these acquaintances, Kürten was introduced to various forms of petty crime, which he initially committed as a means of feeding and clothing himself when living on the streets.

Kürten later claimed to have committed his first murders at the age of nine, when he pushed a school friend whom he knew was unable to swim off a log raft. When a second boy attempted to save the drowning youngster, Kürten held his head under the water, so that both boys drowned. Both deaths were ruled by authorities as being accidental.

===Adolescence===
At the age of 13, Kürten formed a relationship with a girl his age and, although she allowed Kürten to undress and fondle her, she would resist any attempts he made to engage in intercourse. To relieve his sexual urges, Kürten resorted to acts of bestiality with sheep, pigs and goats in local stables, but later claimed he obtained his greatest sense of elation if he stabbed the animals just before achieving orgasm. Thus, he began stabbing and slashing animals with increasing frequency to achieve orgasms, although he was adamant this behaviour ended when he was observed stabbing a pig. He also attempted to rape the same sister his father had earlier molested.

In 1897, Kürten left school. At his father&#x27;s insistence, he obtained employment as an apprentice moulder. This apprenticeship lasted for two years before Kürten stole all the money he could find in his household, plus approximately 300 gold marks from his employer, and ran away from home. He relocated to Koblenz, where he began a brief relationship with a prostitute two years his senior who, he claimed, willingly submitted to every form of sexual perversion he demanded of her. He was apprehended four weeks later and charged with both breaking and entering and theft, and subsequently sentenced to one month&#x27;s imprisonment. He was released from prison in August 1899 and reverted to a life of petty crime.

==First attempted murder==

Kürten claimed to have committed his first murder in adulthood in November 1899. In his 1930 confessions to investigators, he claimed to have &quot;picked up an 18-year-old girl at the Alleestraße&quot; and persuaded her to accompany him to the Hofgarten. There, he claimed to have engaged in sex with the girl before strangling her into unconsciousness with his bare hands before leaving the scene, believing her to be dead.

No contemporaneous records exist to corroborate Kürten&#x27;s claims. If this attack did take place, the victim likely survived this assault. Nonetheless, Kürten later stated that, via committing this act, he had proven to himself that the greatest heights of sexual ecstasy could only be achieved in this manner.

===First convictions===
Shortly thereafter, in 1900, Kürten was arrested for fraud. He would be rearrested later the same year on the same charge, although on this second occasion, charges pertaining to his 1899 Düsseldorf thefts, plus the attempted murder of a girl with a firearm, were added to the indictment. Consequently, Kürten was sentenced to four years&#x27; imprisonment in October 1900. He served this sentence in Derendorf, a borough of Düsseldorf.

Released in the summer of 1904, Kürten was drafted into the Imperial German Army; he was deployed to the city of Metz in Lorraine to serve in the 98th Infantry Regiment, although he soon deserted. That autumn, Kürten began committing acts of arson, which he would discreetly watch from a distance as emergency services attempted to extinguish the fires. The majority of these fires were in barns and haylofts, and Kürten would admit to police he had committed around twenty-four acts of arson upon his arrest that New Year&#x27;s Eve. He also freely admitted these fires had been committed both for his sexual excitement and in the hope of burning sleeping tramps alive.

As a result of his desertion, Kürten was tried by the military court and convicted of desertion in addition to multiple counts of arson, robbery and attempted robbery (the latter charges pertaining to acts he had also committed that year), and was subsequently imprisoned from 1905 to 1913. He served his sentence in Münster, with much of his time spent in solitary confinement for repeated instances of insubordination. He would later claim to investigators and psychologists this period of incarceration was that in which he first encountered severe forms of discipline, and as such, the erotic fantasies he had earlier developed while incarcerated in Derendorf expanded to include graphic fantasies of his striking out at society and killing masses of people; these fantasies became ever more paramount and overbearing in his mind, and Kürten later claimed that he derived the &quot;sort of pleasures from these visions that other people would get from thinking about a naked woman&quot;, adding that he occasionally spontaneously ejaculated while preoccupied with such thoughts.
==Murders==

===First murder===

The first murder Kürten definitively committed occurred on 25 May 1913. During the course of a burglary at a tavern in Mülheim am Rhein, he encountered a nine-year-old girl named Christine Klein asleep in her bed. Kürten strangled the child, then slashed her twice across the throat with a pocket knife, ejaculating as he heard the blood dripping from her wounds onto the floor by her bed and on his hand.

The following day, Kürten specifically returned to Köln to drink in a tavern located directly opposite that in which he had murdered Klein, so that he could listen to the locals&#x27; reactions to the child&#x27;s murder. He later recollected to investigators that he derived an extreme sense of gratification from the general disgust, repulsion, and outrage he had heard in the patrons&#x27; conversations. Moreover, in the weeks following Klein&#x27;s funeral, Kürten occasionally travelled to Mülheim am Rhein to visit the child&#x27;s grave, adding that when he handled the soil covering the grave, he spontaneously ejaculated.

Two months later—again in the course of committing a burglary with the aid of a skeleton key—Kürten broke into a home in Düsseldorf. Discovering a 17-year-old girl named Gertrud Franken asleep in her bed, Kürten manually strangled the girl, ejaculating at the sight of blood spouting from her mouth, before leaving the crime scene. Kürten managed to escape from the scene of this attempted murder and the earlier murder of Klein undetected.

===Imprisonment and release===
Just days after the attempted murder of Franken, on 14 July, Kürten was arrested for a series of arson attacks and burglaries. He was sentenced to six years imprisonment, although his repeated instances of insubordination, while imprisoned, saw his incarceration extended by a further two years. Kürten served this sentence in a military prison in the town of Brieg (then part of the German Empire).

Released in April 1921, Kürten relocated to Altenburg, where he initially lived with his sister. Through his sister, Kürten became acquainted with a woman three years his senior named Auguste Scharf, a sweet shop proprietor and former prostitute who had previously been convicted of shooting her fiancé to death, and to whom Kürten initially posed as a former prisoner of war. Two years later, Kürten and Scharf married, and although the couple regularly engaged in sex, Kürten later admitted he could consummate his marriage only by fantasising about committing violence against another individual, and that, after their wedding night, he engaged in intercourse with his wife only at her invitation. 

For the first time in his life, Kürten obtained regular employment, also becoming an active trades union official, although, with the exception of his wife, he formed no close friendships. In 1925, he returned with Scharf to Düsseldorf, where he soon began affairs with a servant girl named Tiede and a housemaid named Mech. Both women were frequently subjected to partial strangulation when they submitted to intercourse, with Tiede once being informed by Kürten, &quot;That&#x27;s what love means.&quot; When his wife discovered his infidelity, Tiede reported Kürten to police, claiming he had seduced her; Mech alleged Kürten had raped her. The more serious charge was later dropped, although Tiede&#x27;s allegations were pursued, thus earning Kürten an eight-month prison sentence for attempted seduction and threatening behaviour. Kürten served six months of this sentence, with his early release being upon the condition he left Düsseldorf. He later successfully appealed the ruling that he relocate from the city.

==1929==
On 3 February 1929, Kürten stalked a middle-aged woman named Apollonia Kühn. Waiting until Kühn was shielded from the view of potential witnesses by bushes, Kürten pounced upon her, grabbing her by the lapels of her coat and shouting the words, &quot;No row! Don&#x27;t scream!&quot; before dragging her into nearby undergrowth, where he proceeded to stab her 24 times with a sharpened pair of scissors. Although many of the blows were inflicted so deeply that the scissors struck her bones, Kühn survived her injuries.
On 8 February, Kürten strangled a nine-year-old girl named Rosa Ohliger into unconsciousness before stabbing her in the stomach, temple, genitals and heart with a pair of scissors, spontaneously ejaculating as he knifed the child. He then inserted his semen into her vagina with his fingers. Kürten then made a rudimentary effort to hide Ohliger&#x27;s body by dragging it beneath a hedge before returning to the scene with a bottle of kerosene several hours later and setting the child&#x27;s body alight, achieving an orgasm at the sight of the flames. Ohliger&#x27;s body was found beneath a hedge the following day. 

Five days later, on 13 February, Kürten murdered a 45-year-old mechanic named Rudolf Scheer in the suburb of Flingen Nord, stabbing him twenty times, particularly about the head, back and eyes. Following the discovery of Scheer&#x27;s body, Kürten returned to the scene of the murder to converse with police, falsely informing one detective he had heard about the murder via telephone.

Despite the differences in age and sex of these three victims, the fact that all three crimes had been committed in the Flingern district of Düsseldorf at dusk, that each victim had received a multitude of stab wounds likely inflicted in rapid succession and invariably involving at least one wound to the temple, plus the absence of a common motive such as robbery, led investigators to conclude the same perpetrator had committed all three attacks. Furthermore, the seemingly random selection of these victims led criminologists to remark as to the abnormal nature of the perpetrator.

Although Kürten did attempt to strangle four women between March and July 1929, one of whom he claimed to have thrown into the Rhine River, he is not known to have killed any further victims until 11 August when he raped, strangled, then repeatedly stabbed a young woman named Maria Hahn. Kürten had first encountered Hahn—whom he described as &quot;a girl looking for marriage&quot;—on 8 August, and had arranged to take her on a date to the Neandertal district of Düsseldorf the following Sunday. After several hours in Hahn&#x27;s company, Kürten lured her into a meadow in order that he could kill her; he later admitted Hahn had repeatedly pleaded with him to spare her life as he alternately strangled her, stabbed her in the chest and head, or sat astride her body, waiting for her to die. Hahn died approximately one hour after Kürten had begun attacking her. Fearful his wife might connect the bloodstains she had noted on his clothes with Hahn&#x27;s murder, Kürten later buried her body in a cornfield, only to return to her body several weeks later with the intention of nailing her decomposing remains to a tree in a mock crucifixion to shock and disgust the public; however, Hahn&#x27;s remains proved too heavy for Kürten to complete this act, and he simply returned her corpse to her grave before embracing and caressing the decomposing body as he lay beneath her remains. He then reburied Hahn&#x27;s body. According to Kürten&#x27;s later confession, both before and after he had attempted to impale Hahn&#x27;s corpse to a tree, he &quot;went to the grave many times and kept improving on it; and every time I thought of what was lying there and was filled with satisfaction.&quot;

Three months after Kürten had murdered Hahn, he posted an anonymous letter to the police in which he confessed to the murder, adding that her remains had been buried in a field. In this letter, Kürten also drew a crude map describing the location of the remains. This letter would prove sufficiently detailed to enable investigators to locate Hahn&#x27;s remains on 15 November.

Following the Hahn murder, Kürten changed his choice of weapon from scissors to a knife in an apparent effort to convince police more than one perpetrator was responsible for the unfolding crime spree. In the early morning of 21 August, he randomly stabbed an 18-year-old girl, a 30-year-old man, and a 37-year-old woman in separate attacks. All three were seriously wounded, and all stated to police their assailant had not spoken a word to them before he had attacked them. Three days later, at a fairground in the suburb of Flehe, Kürten observed two foster sisters (aged 5 and 14) walking from the fairground, through adjoining allotments, en route to their home. Sending the older girl, Luise Lenzen, on an errand to purchase cigarettes for him upon the promise of being given 20 pfennig, Kürten lifted the younger child, Gertrude Hamacher, off the ground by her neck and strangled her into unconsciousness before cutting her throat and discarding her body in a patch of runner beans. When Lenzen returned to the scene, Kürten partially strangled her before stabbing her about the torso, with one wound piercing her aorta. He also bit and twice cut her throat before sucking blood from the wounds. Neither girl had been sexually assaulted, and the fact only Lenzen&#x27;s footprints were found within seven meters of her body suggests she may have attempted to flee from her attacker before collapsing. 

The following day, Kürten accosted a 27-year-old housemaid named Gertrude Schulte, whom he openly asked to engage in sex with him. Upon being rebuffed, Kürten shouted, &quot;Well, die then!&quot; before repeatedly stabbing the woman in the head, neck, shoulder, and back. Schulte survived her injuries, although she was unable to provide investigators with a clear description of her assailant, beyond assuming his age to be around 40.

Kürten attempted to murder two further victims—one by strangulation; another by stabbing—in September, before opting to predominantly use a hammer in his murders.

===Hammer attacks===

On the evening of 30 September, Kürten encountered a 31-year-old servant girl named Ida Reuter at Düsseldorf station. He successfully persuaded Reuter to accompany him to a café, and then for a walk through the local Hofgarten close to the Rhine River. At this location, he repeatedly struck her about the head with a hammer both before and after he had raped her. At one stage in this assault, Reuter regained consciousness and began pleading with Kürten to spare her life. In response, Kürten simply &quot;gave her other hammer blows on the head and misused her&quot;.

Eleven days later, on 11 October, he encountered a 22-year-old servant girl named Elizabeth Dörrier outside a theatre. As had been the case with Reuter, Dörrier agreed to accompany Kürten for a drink at a café before the pair took a train to Grafenberg, to walk alongside the Kleine Düssel river. Here she was struck once across her right temple with a hammer, then raped. Kürten struck her repeatedly about the head and both temples with his hammer and left her for dead. Dörrier was found in a coma at 6:30 a.m. the following morning; she died from her injuries the following day. On 25 October, Kürten attacked two women with a hammer; both survived, although in the second instance, this may have been because Kürten&#x27;s hammer broke in the attack.

On 7 November 1929, Kürten encountered a 5-year-old girl named Gertrude Albermann in the Flingern district of Düsseldorf; he persuaded the child to accompany him to a section of deserted allotments, where he seized her by the throat and strangled her, stabbing her once in the left temple with a pair of scissors as per his modus operandi. When Albermann &quot;collapsed to the ground without a sound&quot;, Kürten stabbed the child 34 further times in the temple and chest before placing her body in a pile of nettles close to a factory wall.

==Investigation==
By the late summer of 1929, the murders committed by the individual the press had dubbed &quot;The Vampire of Düsseldorf&quot; were receiving considerable national and international attention. Due to the sheer savagery of the murders, the diverse backgrounds of the victims, and the differing methods in which they had been assaulted and/or murdered, both the police and the press theorized the spate of assaults and murders were the work of more than one perpetrator. By the end of 1929, Düsseldorf police had received more than 13,000 letters from the public. With assistance from surrounding police forces, each lead was painstakingly pursued. As a result of this collective investigation into the killings, more than 9,000 individuals were interviewed, 2,650 other clues painstakingly pursued and a list of 900,000 different names were compiled upon an official potential suspect list.

===Correspondence===
Two days after the murder of Gertrude Albermann, a local communist newspaper received a map revealing the location of the grave of Maria Hahn. In this drawing, Kürten also revealed precisely where he had left Albermann&#x27;s body (which had been found earlier that day), describing the exact position of her corpse, which he stated could be found face-down among bricks and rubble. An analysis of the handwriting revealed the author was the same individual who had anonymously informed police in a letter dated 14 October that he had killed Hahn and buried her body &quot;at the edge of the woods&quot;. Each of the three letters Kürten had thus far sent to newspapers and police describing his exploits and threatening further assaults and murders were examined by a graphologist, who confirmed the same individual had written each letter, thus leading Ernst Gennat, chief inspector of the Berlin Police, to conclude that one man was responsible for most or all of the spate of assaults and murders.

===1930===
The murder of Gertrude Albermann proved to be Kürten&#x27;s final fatal attack, although he did engage in a spate of non-fatal hammer attacks and attempted strangulations between February and May 1930, maiming ten victims in these assaults. All the victims survived and many were able to describe their attacker to the police.

On 14 May 1930, an unknown man approached a 20-year-old woman named Maria Budlick at Düsseldorf station. Discovering Budlick had travelled to Düsseldorf from Köln in search of lodgings and employment, he offered to direct her towards a local hostel. Budlick agreed to follow the man, although she became apprehensive when he attempted to lead her through a scarcely populated park. The pair began to argue, whereupon another man approached the two, asking whether Budlick was being pestered by her companion. When Budlick nodded, the man with whom she had been arguing simply walked away. The identity of the man who reportedly came to Budlick&#x27;s aid was Peter Kürten.

Kürten invited the distressed young woman to his apartment on Mettmanner Straße to eat and drink before Budlick—correctly deducing the underlying motive for Kürten&#x27;s hospitality—stated she was uninterested in engaging in sex with him. Kürten calmly agreed and offered to lead Budlick to a hotel, although he instead lured her into the Grafenburg Woods, where he seized her by the throat and attempted to strangle her as he raped her. When Budlick began to scream, Kürten released his grasp on her throat, before allowing her to leave.

Budlick did not report this assault to police, but described her ordeal in a letter to a friend, although she addressed the letter incorrectly. As such, the letter was opened at the post office by a clerk on 19 May. Upon reading the contents of the letter, this clerk forwarded the letter to the Düsseldorf police. This letter was read by Chief Inspector Gennat, who assumed there was a slim chance Budlick&#x27;s assailant might be the Düsseldorf murderer. Gennat interviewed Budlick, who recounted her ordeal, further divulging one of the reasons Kürten had spared her was because she had falsely informed him she could not remember his address. She agreed to lead the police to Kürten&#x27;s home, on Mettmanner Straße. When the landlady of the property let Budlick into the room of 71 Mettmanner Straße, Budlick confirmed to Gennat that this was the address of her assailant. The landlady confirmed to the chief inspector the tenant&#x27;s name was Peter Kürten.

==Arrest and confession==

Although Kürten was not at home when Budlick and Gennat searched his property, he spotted the pair in the communal hallway and promptly left. Knowing that his identity was now known to the police and suspecting they may also have connected him to the crimes committed by the Vampire of Düsseldorf, Kürten confessed to his wife he had raped Budlick and that because of his previous convictions, he may receive fifteen years penal labour. With his wife&#x27;s consent, he found lodgings in the Adlerstraße district of Düsseldorf, and did not return to his own home until 23 May. Upon returning home, Kürten confessed to his wife he was the Vampire of Düsseldorf. He urged his wife to collect the substantial reward offered for his capture. Auguste Kürten contacted the police the following day. In the information provided to detectives, Kürten&#x27;s wife explained that although she had known her husband had been repeatedly imprisoned in the past, she was unaware of his culpability in any murders. She then added that her husband had confessed to her his culpability in the Düsseldorf murders and that he was willing to likewise confess to the police. Furthermore, he was to meet her outside St. Rochus church later that day. That afternoon, Kürten was arrested at gunpoint.

Kürten freely admitted his guilt in all the crimes police had attributed to the Vampire of Düsseldorf, and further confessed he had committed the unsolved murder of Christine Klein and the attempted murder of Gertrud Franken in 1913. In total, Kürten admitted to 68 crimes including nine murders and 31 attempted murders. He made no attempt to excuse his crimes but justified them on the basis of what he saw as the injustices he had endured throughout his life. Nonetheless, he was adamant he had not tortured any of his child victims. Kürten also admitted to both investigators and psychiatrists that the sight of his victim&#x27;s blood was, on many occasions, sufficient to bring him to orgasm, and that, on occasion, if he experienced ejaculation in the act of strangling a woman, he would immediately become apologetic to his victim, proclaiming, &quot;That&#x27;s what love is all about&quot;. He further claimed to have drunk the blood from the throat of one victim, from the temple of another, and to have licked the blood from a third victim&#x27;s hands. In the Hahn murder, he had drunk so much blood from the neck wound that he had vomited. Kürten also admitted to having decapitated a swan in the spring of 1930 in order that he could drink the blood from the animal&#x27;s neck, achieving ejaculation in the process.

===Psychological study===
As Kürten awaited his trial, then later as he awaited his execution, he was extensively interviewed by Karl Berg. In these interviews, Kürten stated to Berg that his primary motive in committing any form of criminal activity was one of sexual pleasure, and that he had begun to associate sexual excitement with violent acts and the sight of blood via indulging in both day-dreams and masturbation fantasies — particularly when he had been isolated from human contact. The majority of his assaults and murders had been committed when his wife had been working evenings, and the number of stab or bludgeoning wounds Kürten inflicted upon each victim had varied depending upon the length of time it had taken him to achieve an orgasm. Furthermore, the sight of his victim&#x27;s blood had been integral to his sexual stimulation. Kürten further elaborated to Berg that once he had committed an attack or murder, the feeling of tension he experienced before the commission of the crime would be superseded by one of relief.

In reference to the choice of weapon used in his attacks, Kürten stressed that although he had changed his method of attack to deceive investigators into believing they were seeking more than one perpetrator, the weapon he used was inconsequential to his ultimate objective of seeing his victim&#x27;s blood. Elaborating, Kürten stated: &quot;Whether I took a knife or a pair of scissors or a hammer in order to see blood was a matter of indifference to me or mere chance. Often after the hammer blows the bleeding victims moved and struggled, just as they did when they were throttled.&quot; Kürten further confided that although he had occasionally penetrated his female victims, he had only done so to feign the act of coitus as a motive for his crimes. He also confessed that many of his later strangulation victims had only survived his attacks because he had achieved an orgasm in the early throes of the assault.

However, Kürten contradicted these claims by proclaiming to both Berg and legal examiners that his primary motive in all his criminal activities was to both &quot;strike back at [an] oppressive society&quot; for what he considered the injustice of his being repeatedly incarcerated throughout his life, and as a form of revenge for the neglect and abuse he had endured as a child. These desires had fomented in his mind throughout the long periods he had been in solitary confinement for various forms of insubordination, and Kürten explained that he deliberately broke minor prison rules as a means of guaranteeing that he would be sentenced to solitary confinement in order that he could indulge in these psychosexual fantasies. To Berg and the legal examiners, Kürten did not deny that he had sexually molested his female victims, or to have stroked or digitally penetrated their genitals as he stabbed, slashed, strangled or bludgeoned their bodies, although throughout his trial Kürten consistently claimed the sexual assault of his victims was not his primary motive.

Both Berg and other psychologists concluded Kürten was not insane, was fully able to control his actions, and appreciated the criminality of his conduct. Each ruled Kürten was legally sane and competent to stand trial.

==Trial==

On 13 April 1931, Kürten stood trial in Düsseldorf. He was charged with nine counts of murder and seven of attempted murder, and was tried before Presiding Judge Rose. Kürten pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to each of the charges. Aside from when delivering testimony, Kürten would spend the duration of his trial surrounded by a heavily guarded shoulder-high iron cage specifically constructed to protect him from attack by the enraged relatives of his victims, and his feet were shackled whenever he was inside this cage.

Proceedings began with the prosecution formally reciting each of the charges against Kürten before they recited the formal confession he had provided to police following his arrest. When then asked by the presiding judge to describe why he had continued to commit acts of arson throughout 1929 and 1930, Kürten explained: &quot;When my desire for injuring people awoke, the love of setting fire to things awoke as well. The sight of the flames excited me, but above all, it was the excitement of the attempts to extinguish the fire and the agitation of those who saw their property being destroyed.&quot;
Having first claimed that his initial confession had been simply to allow his wife to recoup the reward money offered for the capture of the Düsseldorf Vampire, several days into his trial, Kürten instructed his defence attorney that he wished to change his plea to one of guilty. Addressing the court, Kürten proclaimed: &quot;I have no remorse. As to whether recollection of my deeds makes me feel ashamed, I will tell you [that] thinking back to all the details is not at all unpleasant. I rather enjoy it.&quot; Further pressed as to whether he considered himself to possess a conscience, Kürten stated he did not. Nonetheless, when pressed as to his motivation in confessing, Kürten reiterated: &quot;Why don&#x27;t you understand that I am fond of my wife, and that I am still fond of her? I have done many wrongs; have been unfaithful over and over again. My wife has never done any wrong. Even when she heard of the many prison sentences I have served, she said: &#x27;I won&#x27;t let you down, otherwise you&#x27;ll be lost altogether.&#x27; I wanted to fix for my wife a carefree old age.&quot;

To counteract Kürten&#x27;s insanity defence, the prosecution introduced five eminent doctors and psychiatrists to testify; each testified that Kürten was legally sane and had been in control of his actions and impulses at all times. Typical of the testimony delivered by these experts was that of , who testified as to Kürten&#x27;s motivation in his crimes being the desire to achieve the sexual gratification he demanded, and that this satisfaction could only be achieved by acts of brutality, violence and Kürten&#x27;s knowledge of the pain and misery his actions caused to others. Berg testified that Kürten&#x27;s motive in committing murder and attempted murder was 90 per cent sadism, and 10 per cent revenge relating to his perceived sense of injustice for both the neglect and abuse he had endured both as a child and the discipline he endured while incarcerated. Moreover, Berg stated that despite Kürten&#x27;s admission to having embraced and digitally penetrated the corpse of Maria Hahn, and to have spontaneously ejaculated while holding the soil covering the coffin of Christine Klein, his conclusion was that Kürten was not a necrophiliac.

Further evidence of Kürten&#x27;s awareness was referenced by the premeditated nature of his crimes; his ability to abandon an attack if he sensed a risk of being disturbed; and his acute memory of both his crimes and their chronological detail. Also disclosed in the first week of the trial were the deaths of the two boys whom Kürten had confessed to drowning at the age of nine, with the prosecution suggesting these deaths indicated Kürten had displayed a homicidal propensity dating much earlier than 1913. However, this view was disputed by medical witnesses, who suggested that although indicative of inherent depravity, these two deaths should not be compared to Kürten&#x27;s later murders as to a child, the death of a friend can be seen as nothing more than an inconsequential passing.

Upon cross-examination, Kürten&#x27;s defence attorney, Alex Wehner, did challenge these experts&#x27; conclusions, arguing the sheer range of perversions his client had engaged in was tantamount to insanity. However, each doctor and psychiatrist remained adamant as to Kürten being legally sane and responsible for his actions.

In a further attempt to discredit the validity of many of the charges recited at the opening stages of the trial, Wehner also questioned whether the occasional physical inaccuracies of the crimes described in his client&#x27;s confession equated to Kürten having fabricated at least some of the crimes, thus supporting his contention Kürten possessed a diseased mind. In response, Berg conceded that sections of Kürten&#x27;s confessions were false, but argued that the knowledge he possessed of the murder scenes and the wounds inflicted upon the victims left him in no doubt as to his guilt, and that the minor embellishments in his confessions could be attributed to Kürten&#x27;s narcissistic personality.

===Conviction===
The trial lasted ten days. On 22 April, the jury retired to consider their verdict. They deliberated for under two hours before reaching their verdict: Kürten was found guilty and sentenced to death on nine counts of murder. He was also found guilty of seven counts of attempted murder. Kürten displayed no emotion as the sentence was passed, although in his final address to the court, he stated that he now saw his crimes as being &quot;so ghastly that [he did] not want to make any sort of excuse for them&quot;.

Kürten did not lodge an appeal of his conviction, although he submitted a petition for pardon to the Minister of Justice, who was a known opponent of capital punishment. The petition was formally rejected on 1 July. Kürten remained composed upon receipt of this news, and asked for permission to see his confessor, to write letters of apology to the relatives of his victims, and a final farewell letter to his wife. All of these requests were granted.

==Execution==
On the evening of 1 July 1931, Kürten received his last meal. He ordered Wiener schnitzel, a bottle of white wine, and fried potatoes. Kürten ate the entire meal before requesting a second helping. The prison staff decided to grant his request.

At 06:00 on 2 July, Kürten was beheaded via guillotine in the grounds of Klingelputz Prison, Cologne. His executioner was Carl Gröpler. He walked unassisted to the guillotine, flanked by the prison psychiatrist and a priest.

Shortly before his head was placed on the guillotine, Kürten turned to the prison psychiatrist and asked the question: &quot;Tell me... after my head is chopped off, will I still be able to hear, at least for a moment, the sound of my own blood gushing from the stump of my neck? That would be the pleasure to end all pleasures.&quot; When asked whether he had any last words to say, Kürten simply smiled and replied, &quot;No&quot;.

==Aftermath==
Following Kürten&#x27;s 1931 execution, his head was bisected and mummified; the brain was removed and subjected to forensic analysis in an attempt to explain his personality and behaviour. The examinations of Kürten&#x27;s brain revealed no abnormalities. The autopsy conducted upon Kürten&#x27;s body revealed that, aside from his having an enlarged thymus gland, Kürten had not been suffering any physical abnormality.

The interviews Kürten granted to Karl Berg in 1930 and 1931 were the first psychological study of a sexual serial killer. The interviews formed the basis of Berg&#x27;s book, &quot;The Sadist.&quot;

Shortly after the Second World War, Kürten&#x27;s head was taken to the United States. It is currently on display at the Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not! museum in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin.

* &quot;Normal: The Düsseldorf Ripper&quot; is a play focusing on the case of Peter Kürten. Scripted by Anthony Neilson, the play was first performed at Edinburgh&#x27;s Pleasance Theatre in August 1991. &quot;Normal: The Düsseldorf Ripper&quot; has since become the inspiration for one film.

===Television===
* The BBC commissioned a documentary on the murders committed by Peter Kürten. This documentary, &quot;Profiles of the Criminal Mind&quot;, largely focuses on the forensic profiling of Kürten&#x27;s crimes, and was first broadcast in 2001.

<text>Pittas are a family, Pittidae, of passerine birds found in Asia, Australasia and Africa. There are 44 species of pittas, all similar in general appearance and habits. The pittas are Old World suboscines, and their closest relatives among other birds are in the genera &quot;Smithornis &quot; and &quot;Calyptomena&quot;. Initially placed in a single genus, as of 2009 they have been split into three genera: &quot;Pitta&quot;, &quot;Erythropitta&quot; and &quot;Hydrornis&quot;. Pittas are medium-sized by passerine standards, at in length, and stocky, with strong, longish legs and long feet. They have very short tails and stout, slightly decurved bills. Many have brightly coloured plumage.

Most pitta species are tropical; a few species can be found in temperate climates. They are mostly found in forests, but some live in scrub and mangroves. They are highly terrestrial and mostly solitary, and usually forage on wet forest floors in areas with good ground cover. They eat earthworms, snails, insects and similar invertebrate prey, as well as small vertebrates. Pittas are monogamous and females lay up to six eggs in a large domed nest in a tree or shrub, or sometimes on the ground. Both parents care for the young. Four species of pittas are fully migratory, and several more are partially so, though their migrations are poorly understood.

Four species of pitta are listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature; a further nine species are listed as vulnerable and several more are near-threatened. The main threat to pittas is habitat loss in the form of rapid deforestation, but they are also targeted by the cage-bird trade. They are popular with birdwatchers because of their bright plumage and the difficulty in seeing them.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The first pitta to be described scientifically was the Indian pitta, which was described and illustrated by George Edwards in 1764. Carl Linnaeus included the species in his revised 12th edition (1766–1768) of the &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; based on Edwards&#x27; descriptions and illustrations as well as other accounts, placing it with the Corvidae as &quot;Corvus brachyurus&quot;. Ten years later Statius Müller moved it and three other pittas to the thrush family Turdidae and the genus &quot;Turdus&quot;, due to similarities of morphology and behaviour. In 1816 Louis Pierre Vieillot moved it to the new genus &quot;Pitta&quot;. The name is derived from the word &quot;pitta&quot; in the Telugu language of South India meaning &quot;small bird&quot;.

The family&#x27;s closest relatives have for a long time been assumed to be the other suboscine birds (suborder Tyranni), and particularly the Old World suboscines; the broadbills, asities and the New World sapayoa. These arboreal relatives were formerly treated as two families, and are now either combined into a single taxon or split into four. A 2006 study confirmed that these were indeed the closest relatives of the pittas. The clade they form, the Eurylaimides, is one of the two infraorders of suboscines, which is one of three suborders of the passerine birds. With regards to their relationship within the Eurylaimides, another 2006 study placed the pittas as a sister clade to two clades of broadbills and asities. This same study postulated an Asian origin for the Eurylaimides and therefore the pittas.

Two DNA studies, from 2015 and 2016, came to a different conclusion, finding that the Eurylaimides were divided into two clades and that the pittas formed a clade with the broadbills of the genera &quot;Smithornis &quot; and &quot;Calyptomena&quot;, with the remaining broadbills and asities in the other clade. The 2016 study also disputed the earlier claims about the origin of the group, and concluded that the most likely ancestral home of the pittas and the Eurylaimides was Africa (the sapayoa having diverged before the core clades had reached Africa). The study found that the pittas diverged from the &quot;Smithornis&quot; and &quot;Calyptomena&quot; broadbills 24 to 30 million years ago, during the Oligocene. The pittas diverged and spread through Asia before the oscines (suborder Passeri) reached the Old World from Australia.

The number of pitta genera has varied considerably since Vieillot, ranging from one to as many as nine. In his 1863 work &quot;A Monograph of the Pittidae&quot;, Daniel Elliot split the pittas into two genera, &quot;Pitta&quot; for the species with comparatively long tails and (the now abandoned) &quot;Brachyurus&quot; for the shorter-tailed species. Barely two decades later, in 1880/81, John Gould split the family into nine genera, in which he also included the lesser melampitta (in the genus &quot;Melampitta&quot;) of New Guinea, where it was kept until 1931 when Ernst Mayr demonstrated that it had the syrinx of an oscine bird. Philip Sclater&#x27;s &quot;Catalogue of the Birds of the British Museum&quot; (1888) brought the number back down to four – &quot;Anthocincla&quot;, &quot;Pitta&quot;, &quot;Eucichla&quot;, and &quot;Coracopitta&quot;. Elliot&#x27;s 1895 &quot;Monograph of the Pittidae&quot; included three genera split into subgenera &quot;Anthocincla&quot;, &quot;Pitta&quot; (subgenera &quot;Calopitta&quot;, &quot;Leucopitta&quot;, &quot;Gigantipitta&quot;, &quot;Hydrornis&quot;, &quot;Coloburis&quot;, &quot;Cervinipitta&quot;, &quot;Purpureipitta&quot;, &quot;Phaenicocichla&quot;, &quot;Monilipitta&quot;, &quot;Erythropitta&quot;, &quot;Cyanopitta&quot;, &quot;Galeripitta&quot;, &quot;Pulchripitta&quot;, &quot;Iridipitta&quot;), and &quot;Eucichla&quot; (subgenera &quot;Ornatipitta&quot;, &quot;Insignipitta&quot;).
Modern treatments of taxa within the family vary as well. A 1975 checklist included six genera, whereas the 2003 volume of the &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot;, which covered the family, placed all the pittas in a single genus. Writing in 1998, Johannes Erritzoe stated that most contemporary authors considered the family to contain a single genus. Before 2006 the family was not well studied using modern anatomical or phylogenetic techniques; two studies, in 1987 and 1990, each used only four species, and comparisons amongst the family as a whole had relied mostly on external features and appearances.

A 2006 study of the nuclear DNA of the pittas was the first to examine most representatives of the family, and found evidence of three major clades of pitta. Based on the study the pittas were split into three genera. The first clade, using the genus name &quot;Erythropitta&quot;, included six species that had previously been considered closely related based on external features. They are all generally small species with small tails, extensive amounts of crimson or red on the underparts, and greenish or blueish backs. The second genus, &quot;Hydrornis&quot;, includes variable Asian species. These species are unified morphologically in exhibiting sexual dimorphism in their plumage, as well as in possessing cryptic juvenile plumage (in all the species thus-far studied). This genus includes the eared pitta, which had often been placed into its own genus, &quot;Anthocincla&quot;, on account of its apparently primitive characteristics. The third genus, &quot;Pitta&quot;, is the most widespread. Most species in this genus have green upperparts with a blue wing-patch, dark upperparts and cinnamon-buff underparts. This clade contains all the migratory pitta species, and it is thought that many of the pitta species from islands are derived from migratory species. This division of the pittas into three genera has been adopted by the International Ornithological Congress&#x27; (IOC) &quot;Birds of the World: Recommended English Names&quot;, the &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot;&#x27;s HBW Alive checklist, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (which follows the HBW Alive checklist).

As with genera, there has been considerable variation in the number of accepted pitta species. The checklists of Sclater and Elliot at the end of the 19th century contained 48 and 47 species respectively. More recent checklists have had fewer than this, one from 1975 listing just 24 species. Since the 1990s, the figure has been between 30 and 32 species; the 2003 &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot; recognised 30. One species not recognised by the handbook is the black-crowned pitta, which it treated as a subspecies of either the garnet pitta or the graceful pitta. Since the publication of the handbook, further splits to pitta species have been made; in 2010 the banded pitta was split into three species, one endemic to Java and Bali, one endemic to Borneo and one found in Sumatra and the Thai-Malay Peninsula. A 2013 study found that the red-bellied pitta, a widespread species found from Sulawesi to Australia, was actually a species complex. The study divided it into 17 new species; some authorities have recognised fewer, for example the IOC have recognised only 10.

==Description==
The pittas are small to medium-sized passerines, ranging in size from the blue-banded pitta at to the giant pitta, which can be up to in length. In weight they range from . Pittas are stout-bodied birds with long, strong tarsi (lower leg bones) and long feet. The colour of the legs and feet can vary dramatically even within a species. This may be a characteristic used by females in judging the quality of a prospective mate. The wings have ten primaries that are generally rounded and short; those of the four migratory species are more pointed. There are nine secondaries with the tenth being vestigial. Anatomically, pittas have large temporal fossae in the skull unlike typical perching birds. The syrinx is tracheo-bronchial and lacks a pessulus or intrinsic muscles. Pittas are behaviourally reluctant to fly, but are capable and even strong fliers. The tails range from being short to very short, and are composed of twelve feathers.

Unlike most other forest-floor bird species, the plumage of pittas is often bright and colourful. Only one species, the eared pitta, has entirely cryptic colours in the adults of both sexes. In the same genus, &quot;Hydrornis&quot;, are three further species with drabber than average plumage, the blue-naped pitta, blue-rumped pitta and rusty-naped pitta. Like the other &quot;Hydrornis&quot; pittas they are sexually dimorphic in their plumage, the females tending towards being drabber and more cryptic than the males. In general the sexes in the family tend to be very similar if not identical. Across most of the family the brighter colours tend to be on the undersides, with patches or areas of bright colours on the rump, wings and uppertail coverts being concealable. Being able to conceal bright colours from above is important as most predators approach from above; four species have brighter upperparts.

==Distribution and habitat==
The pittas are generally birds of tropical forests, semi-forests and scrub. Most species need forests with much cover, a rich understory, and leaf litter for feeding, and they are often found near waterways as well. Some species inhabit swamps and bamboo forests, and the mangrove pitta, as its name suggests, is a mangrove specialist. Several species are lowland forest specialists. For example, the rainbow pitta is not found above . Other species may occur at much higher elevations, including, for example, the rusty-naped pitta, which has been found up to . The altitudinal preferences varies in the fairy pitta across its range, it can be found up to in Taiwan but stays at lower altitudes in Japan. As well as natural habitats, pittas may use human-altered spaces. For example, migrating blue-winged pittas and hooded pittas use parks and urban gardens in Singapore.

The greatest diversity of pittas is found in South-east Asia. Of the three genera, the large genus &quot;Pitta&quot; is the most widespread. The two species found in Africa, the African pitta and green-breasted pitta, are from this clade, as is the most northerly species (the fairy pitta) and the most southerly (the noisy pitta, &quot;Pitta versicolor&quot;). The most remote insular endemics are in this group as well, including the black-faced pitta, which is endemic to the Solomon Islands. The pittas of the clade &quot;Erythropitta&quot; are mostly found in Asia. with one species, the Papuan pitta, reaching the north of Australia. The &quot;Hydrornis&quot; pittas are exclusively Asian. Some pittas have large distributions, like the hooded pitta, which ranges from Nepal to New Guinea, while others have much smaller ones, like the superb pitta, which is endemic to the tiny island of Manus in the Admiralty Islands.

The movements of pittas are poorly known and notoriously difficult to study. Bird ringing studies have not shed much light on this. One study in the Philippines ringed 2000 red-bellied pittas but only recaptured ten birds, and only one of these recaptures was more than two months after the initial capture. Only four species of pitta are fully or mostly migratory, all in the genus &quot;Pitta&quot;: the Indian pitta, the African pitta, the fairy pitta and the blue-winged pitta. As well as these four, the northern subspecies of the hooded pitta is a full migrant. Other species make smaller or more local, and poorly understood, movements across small parts of their range, including the noisy pitta of Australia. The migration of pittas is apparently nocturnal, and pittas migrate in small loose flocks that use the same resting and foraging sites each year.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Sociality and calls===


Pittas are diurnal, requiring light to find their often cryptic prey. They are nevertheless often found in darker areas and are highly secretive, though they will respond to imitations of their calls. They are generally found as single birds, even young birds not associating with their parents unless they are being fed. The only exception to their solitary lifestyle is small groups that have been observed forming during migration.

The pittas are strongly territorial, with territories varying in size from in the African pitta to in the rainbow pitta. They have also been found to be highly aggressive in captivity, attacking other species and even their own; such behaviour has not been observed in the wild. Pittas will perform territory-defence displays on the edges of their territories; fights between rivals have only been recorded once. One such territorial display is given by the rainbow pitta, which holds its legs straight and bows to a rival on the edge of its territory, while making a purring call. Displays like this are paired with calls made out of sight of potential rivals; these territorial calls are frequent and can account for up to 12% of a bird&#x27;s daylight activity. Migratory species will defend non-breeding feeding territories as well as their breeding ones.

The vocalisations of pittas are best described as calls, as they are generally short, mono or disyllabic, and often fluting or whirring. They are made by both sexes and throughout the year. One species, the black-and-crimson pitta, was also described making a mechanical noise (sonation) in 2013. The sonation, a clapping sound, was made in flight and is hypothesised to be made by the wings.

===Diet and feeding===
Earthworms form the major part of the diet of pittas, followed by snails. Earthworms can become seasonally unavailable in dry conditions when the worms move deeper into the soil, and pittas also take a wide range of other invertebrate prey, including many insects groups such as termites, ants, beetles, true bugs, and lepidopterans. Freshwater crabs, centipedes, millipedes, and spiders are also taken. Some species, such as the fairy pitta and rainbow pitta, have been recorded feeding on small vertebrate prey. This including skinks, frogs, snakes and, in the case of the fairy pitta, shrews. There are also records of some pittas taking plant food, such as the &quot;Carpentaria&quot; palm fruits or maize seeds.

Pittas feed in a thrush-like fashion, moving aside leaves with a sweeping motion of the bill. They have also been observed to probe the moist soil with their bills to locate earthworms. They have a keen sense of smell, and it has been suggested that they are able to locate earthworms this way. This suggestion was supported by a study which found that the Indian pitta has the largest olfactory bulb of 25 passerines examined. Eight species have been recorded using stones as anvils on which to smash open snails to eat, and the rainbow pitta has been observed using the root of a tree to do so.

===Breeding===
Like most birds, pittas are monogamous breeders, and defend breeding territories. Most species are seasonal breeders, timing their breeding to occur at the onset of the rainy season. An exception to this is the superb pitta, which breeds almost year-round, as the island of Manus on which it breeds remains wet all year. The courtship behaviours of the family are poorly known, but the elaborate dance of the African pitta includes jumping into the air with a puffed-out breast and parachuting back down to the perch.

Pittas build a rudimentary nest that is a dome with a side entrance. The structure of the nest is consistent across the whole family. The nest is as large as a rugby ball, and is usually well-camouflaged amongst vines or vegetation of some kind. The nest&#x27;s appearance is also difficult to distinguish from a heap of leaves pushed together by the wind; a few species create a &quot;doormat&quot; of sticks (sometimes decorated with mammal dung) by the entrance. The nests can either be placed on the ground or in trees. Some species always nest in trees, like both African species, others nest only on the ground, and others show considerable variation. Both sexes help to build the nest, but the male does most of the work. It takes around two to eight days to build a new nest; this probably varies depending on the experience of the birds involved. A new nest is constructed for each nesting attempt, and work on building a nest for a second brood may start while the chicks from the first brood are still being fed.

The clutch size varies by species. Typically three to five eggs are laid, but two is typical for the garnet pitta, whereas six is more common for the blue-winged pitta and the Indian pitta. It is thought that species with higher levels of predation tend to have smaller clutches, as smaller clutches involve fewer provisioning trips that might alert a predator to the presence of a nest, and smaller clutches are easier to replace if lost. Clutch size may vary within a species depending on latitude. A study of noisy pittas found that birds in the tropics had smaller clutch sizes than those in more temperate environments. The eggs of pittas are slightly pointed at one end, and generally smooth (the deeply pitted eggs of the superb pitta being the exception to this). The size of eggs varies by species, smaller-sized species laying smaller eggs. There is also some variation in egg size within a species in species with large ranges. For example, the eggs of noisy pittas are smaller closer to the tropics. Eggs are typically white or creamy, and usually slightly glossy.

Both parents incubate the clutch, the period between laying and hatching being between 14 and 18 days (14 to 16 being more typical). The chicks usually hatch asynchronously, over several days, but in some species the hatching is synchronous. On hatching the Gurney&#x27;s pitta parents are reported to consume the eggshells. This behaviour ensures that the calcium used to create the eggs is not lost. It is unknown if other species do this, but it is a common behaviour among birds. As with the incubation, both parents are involved in rearing the chicks. The chicks of pittas are entirely altricial, hatching both naked and blind, and dependent upon their parents for warmth, food and nest sanitation. Young chicks are brooded continuously, the female brooding alone in some species and sharing responsibilities with the male in others. The males and females make regular feeding trips to the chicks; one study of Gurney&#x27;s pittas found a pair made 2300 feeding visits to the nest, traveling an estimated over the nestling stage. Earthworms are important food items for many species, and the dominant item in the nestling diet of some. 73% of the parental visits of fairy pittas, 63% of rainbow pitta&#x27;s, up to 79% of Gurney&#x27;s pitta&#x27;s visits involved bringing earthworms. Parents can and do carry more than one item in their bills during visits; in a study of breeding fairy pittas, as many as six items were observed being brought in a single visit; less than four was more typical. When the chicks are small, prey may be broken up before being fed to the chicks, and larger prey items like skinks and snakes are only fed to chicks who are old enough to manage them.

==Relationship with humans==
The brilliant plumage of many pittas has resulted in considerable interest in pittas from people living within their range, scientists, aviculturists and birdwatchers, and has led to the colloquial name jewel-thrushes. Such is their attractiveness that, in Borneo, even the body of a dead pitta can be a favoured toy for local children. They have proven difficult to maintain and breed in captivity, requiring large amounts of space, humidity and sufficient vegetation of the right kind. Pittas are a very popular group of birds with birdwatchers, due to the dazzling plumage of many species and the relative difficulty of seeing these retiring birds in dark forests. Their desirability as birdwatching targets was the subject of the book &quot;The Jewel Hunter&quot; (2013), in which the writer Chris Goodie recounted his attempt to see every species of pitta.

===Status and conservation===
Pittas are generally forest birds and, as such, are vulnerable to habitat loss caused by rapid deforestation. They can also be difficult birds to survey and are easily overlooked. Four species are assessed to be endangered, and a further nine are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN. Eight species are listed as near-threatened, and one, the Louisiade pitta, is too poorly known to be assessed and is listed as data deficient.

The Gurney&#x27;s pitta was not seen for 34 years between 1952 and 1986, before a small population was discovered in southern Thailand. This small population declined after its rediscovery, and, by 2000, it had reached a low of 10 pairs, and was listed as critically endangered. In 2003, the species was found in Burma for the first time since 1914, and in large numbers, between nine and thirty five thousand pairs. The species was considerably less threatened than thought, but it is still of considerable conservation concern, as deforestation of the habitat in Burma continues. The rapid rate of deforestation in Borneo has pushed the blue-headed pitta, considered common and secure as recently as 1996, into the list of species considered vulnerable.

Pittas have been targeted by poachers for the illegal wild-bird trade. They are not targeted because of their song, as many songbirds are, and may simply be captured as bycatch from collecting other species, and because of their attractive plumage. According to some trappers, they also may end up being eaten for food. On Manus, locals report that predation by snakes, including the brown tree snake, is responsible for the rarity of the endangered superb pitta, but the snake, the introduction of which is responsible for several extinctions of island birds across the Pacific, is native to the island, and is therefore likely a natural threat.

==Species of pitta==

There are 44 species of pitta in three genera according to the International Ornithological Congress&#x27; (IOC) &quot;Birds of the World: Recommended English Names&quot;.

<text>Acid jazz (also known as club jazz, psychedelic jazz, or groove jazz) is a music genre that combines elements of funk, soul, and hip hop, as well as jazz and disco. Acid jazz originated in clubs in London during the 1980s with the rare groove movement and spread to the United States, Western Europe, Latin America and Japan. Acts included The Brand New Heavies, Incognito, James Taylor Quartet, Us3, and Jamiroquai from the UK, and Guru, Buckshot LeFonque and Digable Planets from the U.S. The rise of electronic club music in the middle to late 1990s led to a decline in interest, and in the twenty-first century, acid jazz became indistinct as a genre. Many acts that might have been defined as acid jazz are seen as jazz-funk, or nu jazz.

==Characteristics==
=== Etymology ===
The genre&#x27;s name was likely coined by Gilles Peterson, and the label was started by Bangs, Eddie Piller, and Gilles. The name refers to the acid house genre, which was popular in UK clubs in the 1980s. However, DJs Femi Williams and Marco Nelson from Young Disciples claimed in a recently unearthed 1992 TV interview that they coined the term because they had a club with acid playing downstairs and jazz upstairs, so they thought it would be amusing to name the upstairs room &quot;The Acid Jazz Room&quot;. The veracity of this claim predating Peterson&#x27;s is dubious, as the interview in question took place five years after the Acid Jazz label was created, and Young Disciples were first active three years after the formation of the label.

=== Evolution ===
Acid jazz consisted of two related movements. The first was based on records by disc jockeys and music producers who added percussion and electronic dance beats to jazz tracks from the 1960s and 1970s. The second movement included groups who were influenced by these recordings and who emphasized a groove. Acid jazz borrowed from jazz, funk, and hip-hop. Because it relies heavily on percussion and live performance, it is sometimes associated with jazz, but its emphasis on groove aligns it more with funk, hip hop, and dance music. The style is characterized by danceable grooves and long, repetitive compositions. Acid jazz bands usually include horns, a rhythm section (bass guitar, drum set and additional percussion), a vocalist who may sing or rap, and a DJ.

==History==
=== Origin ===
Acid jazz has its origins in the 1950s, 1960s, when psychedelic styles were being incorporated into other musical genres, jazz being one of these. Acid jazz became popular in London clubs during the 1980s when disc jockeys associated with the rare groove movement played obscure jazz records. Their interests were in the fringe of jazz fusion, jazz funk, and the soul jazz of 1960s. Particularly significant were records from the Blue Note catalogue. These DJs included Gilles Peterson, who had residencies at several London clubs in the 1980s. Peterson began in a small pirate radio station and then moved to the larger Kiss-FM. In 1988 with producer Eddie Piller he formed the label Acid Jazz Records. The first release from the company was the compilation &quot;Totally Wired&quot;, which contained obscure jazz funk tracks from the 1970s with updated new tracks.

In 1990 Peterson left to start the label Talkin&#x27; Loud at Phonogram. The company signed Galliano, Young Disciples, and Urban Species. Another British record label, Fourth and Broadway Records, was formed in 1990 and began a compilation series with the title &quot;The Rebirth of Cool&quot;. The label&#x27;s roster included Pharoah Sanders, Stereo MCs, MC Solaar, and Courtney Pine.

In 1991 acid jazz broke into the mainstream with the success of Brand New Heavies. After one self-titled album (1990) with Acid Jazz Records, the group signed with FFRR Records and had the hit singles &quot;Never Stop&quot; and &quot;Dream Come True&quot;. Other bands included Incognito and Us3, whose &quot;Cantaloop (Flip Fantasia)&quot; (1993) was the biggest hit in the genre. Also successful was Jamiroquai, an early act for Acid Jazz Records that signed with Sony, which released &quot;Travelling Without Moving&quot; (1996) and the hit single &quot;Virtual Insanity&quot;. Other live acts included Stereo MCs and the James Taylor Quartet. The mainstream success of acid jazz was followed by many compilations which left the public confused about the genre.

===Acid jazz in the US===

Acid jazz spread to the United States in the early 1990s. It reached New York City in 1990 when British promoter Maurice Bernstein and his South African partner Jonathan Rudnick opened Groove Academy as a party at the Giant Step club in the basement of the Metropolis Café in Union Square. Groove Academy turned into a record label and media company. Acid jazz musicians in New York City included Brooklyn Funk Essentials, DJ Smash, and Jerome Van Rossum. In San Francisco acid jazz was released by Ubiquity Records, by Solsonics in Los Angeles, and The Greyboy Allstars in San Diego.

A Tribe Called Quest borrowed from jazz for their album &quot;The Low End Theory&quot; (1991). Under the name Buckshot LeFonque, Branford Marsalis and Digable Planets won a Grammy Award for the 1993 single &quot;Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like Dat)&quot;.

Formed in New York in 1990, Groove Collective produced their self-titled debut in 1993. The rapper Guru released a series of albums recorded with jazz musicians as the &quot;Jazzmatazz&quot; series.

Stemming from Chicago in 1993, Liquid Soul achieved a national profile in 1996 when their self-titled debut LP was re-released by Ark21. In 2000 their album &quot;Here&#x27;s the Deal&quot; was nominated in the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Album category.

===Around the world===
Acid jazz soon gained an international following, including in Japan, Germany, Brazil and Eastern Europe. From Japan, United Future Organization gained an international reputation, signing an American record deal in 1994. Other acts from Japan included Mondo Grosso, and Gota Yashiki Skalpel came from Poland.

===Decline===
The rise of electronic club music in the mid- to late-1990s led to a decline in interest in acid jazz among the record buying public, although the genre continued to have a reduced worldwide following. In the twenty-first century the movement became so intertwined with other forms that it became indistinct as a genre and many acts that might have been defined as acid jazz are now seen as jazz funk, neo soul or jazz rap.

&quot;Q&quot; magazine stated &quot;Acid jazz was the most significant jazz form to emerge out of the British music scene&quot;. One major legacy of the genre is its influence on the jam band movement, with acid jazz proving a suitable medium for extended improvisation for acts such as Medeski, Martin and Wood and The Greyboy Allstars.

<text>&quot;McJob&quot; is a slang term for a low-paying, low-prestige dead-end job that requires few skills and offers very little chance of advancement. The term &quot;McJob&quot; comes from the name of the fast-food restaurant McDonald&#x27;s, but is used to describe any low-status jobregardless of employerwhere little training is required, staff turnover is high, and workers&#x27; activities are tightly regulated by managers.

==History==

&quot;McJob&quot; was in use at least as early as 1986 — it appears in an article by sociologist Amitai Etzioni — and the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines it as &quot;[a]n unstimulating, low-paid job with few prospects, esp. one created by the expansion of the service sector.&quot; Lack of job security is common.

The term was popularized by Douglas Coupland&#x27;s 1991 novel &quot;Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture&quot;, which described a &quot;McJob&quot; as a &quot;low-pay, low-prestige, low-dignity, low benefit, no-future job in the service sector. Frequently considered a satisfying career choice by people who have never held one.&quot;

In the face of objections from McDonald&#x27;s, the term &quot;McJob&quot; was added to &quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Collegiate Dictionary&quot; in 2003. In an open letter to Merriam-Webster, McDonald&#x27;s CEO, James Cantalupo denounced the definition as a &quot;slap in the face&quot; to all restaurant employees, and stated that &quot;a more appropriate definition of a &#x27;McJob&#x27; might be &#x27;teaches responsibility&#x27;&quot;. Merriam-Webster responded that &quot;[they stood] by the accuracy and appropriateness of [their] definition.&quot;

On 20 March 2007, the BBC reported that the UK arm of McDonald&#x27;s planned a public petition to have the OED&#x27;s definition of &quot;McJob&quot; changed. Lorraine Homer from McDonald&#x27;s stated that the company feels the definition is &quot;out of date and inaccurate&quot;. McDonald&#x27;s UK CEO, Peter Beresford, described the term as &quot;demeaning to the hard work and dedication displayed by the 67,000 McDonald&#x27;s employees throughout the UK&quot;. The company would prefer the definition to be rewritten to &quot;reflect a job that is stimulating, rewarding ... and offers skills that last a lifetime&quot;.

These comments run counter to the principle that dictionaries simply record linguistic usage rather than judge it, and that dropping the entry for &quot;McJob&quot; would be a precedent for bowdlerising definitions of other derogatory terms. McDonald&#x27;s attempted to get all of its workers to sign the petition but many refused on the grounds that the current definition is accurate despite the company&#x27;s complaint.

During the aforementioned arguments that broke out when Merriam-Webster included &quot;McJob&quot; in its new edition, McDonald&#x27;s officials implied the company might bring a lawsuit against the dictionary based on this trademark issue, but never did so. McDonald&#x27;s disputes that its jobs are poor, because the company has been nominated for employee awards that are created by employers. However, this was contradicted in the outcome of the UK McLibel court case, in which the judges ruled that it was fair to say that McDonald&#x27;s employees worldwide &quot;do badly in terms of pay and conditions&quot;.

The term &quot;McJOBS&quot; was registered as a trademark by McDonald&#x27;s in 1984 as a name and image for &quot;training handicapped persons as restaurant employees&quot;. The trademark lapsed in February 1992, and was declared canceled by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Following the October 1992 publication of &quot;Generation X&quot; in paperback, McDonald&#x27;s restored the trademark.

==Accuracy of the term==
There are often wide variations in how workers are actually treated depending on the local franchise owner. Some employees start out in entry-level McJobs and later become assistant managers or managers, continuing to work at the same franchise for many years; however this is the exception rather than the norm. McDonald&#x27;s advertises that its former CEO, Jim Skinner, began working at the company as a regular restaurant employee, and that 20 of its top 50 managers began work as regular crew members.

According to Jim Cantalupo, former CEO of McDonald&#x27;s, the perception of fast-food work being boring and mindless is inaccurate, and over 1,000 of the people who now own McDonald&#x27;s franchises began behind the counter. Because McDonald&#x27;s has over 400,000 employees and high turnover, Cantalupo&#x27;s contention has been criticized as being invalid, working to highlight the exception rather than the rule.

In 2006, McDonald&#x27;s undertook an advertising campaign in the United Kingdom to challenge the perceptions of the &quot;McJob&quot;. The campaign, developed by Barkers Advertising and supported by research conducted by Adrian Furnham, professor of psychology at University College London, highlighted the benefits of working for the organization, stating that they were &quot;Not bad for a McJob&quot;. The advertisements ran at London&#x27;s Piccadilly Circus.

<doc id="264047" wikidata="Q2850490" url="?curid=264047" title="Anna Elizabeth Dickinson">
<text>Anna Elizabeth Dickinson (October 28, 1842 – October 22, 1932) was an American orator and lecturer. An advocate for the abolition of slavery and for women&#x27;s rights, Dickinson was the first woman to give a political address before the United States Congress. A gifted speaker at a very young age, she aided the Republican Party in the hard-fought 1863 elections and significantly influenced the distribution of political power in the Union just prior to the Civil War. Dickinson was the first white woman on record to summit Colorado&#x27;s Longs Peak, Lincoln Peak, and Elbert Peak (on a mule), and she was the second to summit Pike&#x27;s Peak.

==Early life==
Dickinson was born on October 28, 1842, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Quakers and abolitionists, John and Mary Edmundson Dickinson. Her Edmundson and Dickinson ancestors immigrated to the United States from England and with other Quakers settled at Tred Avon, or Third Haven, near Easton, Maryland, in about the 1660s. She had three older brothers—John, Edwin, and Samuel—and an older sister, Susan.

Dickinson&#x27;s father died in 1844 when she was two years old after giving a speech against slavery. Left in poverty, Mary opened a school in their home and took in boarders to support the family. Dickinson was educated at Friends Select School of Philadelphia and for a short time, until age 15, at Westtown School. A hardworking student, she spent any money she earned on books, having acquired an interest in literary classics from her mother. At the age of 14, she converted to the Methodist Church, and remained active in the church throughout her life.

==Career==
===Early years===

&quot;The Liberator&quot;, a newspaper owned by abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, published an essay on February 22, 1856, about the abuse received by an abolitionist schoolteacher in Kentucky. She was not yet 14.

She went to work at the age of 15, about 1857, as a copyist. In 1859 and 1860, she was a teacher in Berks County, Pennsylvania, 
during which time she lived with the John and Elizabeth Longstreth family in Bristol, Pennsylvania. In May 1861, she obtained a clerkship for the United States Mint; she was one of the mint&#x27;s first female employees. Dickinson was removed in December of that year for saying that General George McClellan&#x27;s poor performance at Battle of Ball&#x27;s Bluff amounted to treason at a public meeting.

===Lecturer===
 Unlike other Americans, Quakers encouraged women to speak in public. She toured the country on behalf of the Sanitary Commission. Encouraged to speak by Lucretia Mott and Dr. Hannah Longshore, she gave impassioned speeches on abolition, reconstruction, women&#x27;s rights, and temperance. Her success led the way for future women speakers.

She spoke publicly first in 1857 when she addressed a man who derided women at a Progressive Friends meeting. After that, she spoke regularly about temperance and abolition. In 1860, she spoke in Philadelphia at the Friends of Progress meeting at Clarkson Hall about &quot;The Rights and Wrongs of Women&quot; and then she addressed the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society in the fall of that year. She gave her first major speech, a two-hour discussion of &quot;The Rights and Wrongs of Women&quot;, on February 27, 1861, in Philadelphia. Lucretia Mott, who delivered abolitionist speeches for decades in Quaker meetinghouses, provided leadership to sell 800 tickets for the Concert Hall event. Mott arranged for a lecture tour, sponsored by the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, for the 19-year-old, who quickly became a popular speaker. The series of speeches helped lead the Emancipation movement.
Having heard her speak, Garrison arranged for her to speak in 1862 in the Palmer Fraternity Course of lectures at the Boston Music Hall. Named &quot;The Girl Orator&quot; by Garrison, she spoke about &quot;The National Crisis&quot;. She visited hospitals and camps during the war to speak to the soldiers. In 1862, she visited soldiers wounded in the war, and then gave a lecture about &quot;Hospital Life&quot; in New England.

During the 1863 United States Senate elections, with the deepening of the Civil War, Dickinson campaigned for several pro-Union Republican candidates in New York, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and Connecticut to audiences that included people who did not support the war. She spoke eloquently and powerfully in support of the Radical Republicans&#x27; anti-slavery platform and for the preservation of the Union. She spoke to coal miners in Pennsylvania soon after draft riots in the area and converted men who had not previously supported abolition. Dickinson was named the &quot;Civil War&#x27;s Joan of Arc&quot; for her promotion of the Union. She was ardent in her condemnation of the Copperheads and other Democrats. She was interviewed in 1863 by Whitelaw Reid, who was a supporter and often wrote about her speaking engagements in the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;.

When she spoke at Cooper Institute in New York City, more than 5,000 people attended the event. It was reported that she &quot;could hold her audience spellbound for as much as two hours. She gave the impression of being under some magical control.&quot; She earned a standing ovation in 1864 for an impassioned speech on the floor of the United States House of Representatives. In attendance were President Abraham Lincoln and civic and military leaders. Invited by Republican leaders, she was the first woman to speak to Congress.

After the Civil War, she remained one of the nation&#x27;s most celebrated lyceum speakers for nearly a decade. She made as much as $20,000 () a year, making a speech every other day on average, and gave most of her earnings away to charity, friends, and relatives. She also maintained a townhouse in Philadelphia, with expensive personal possessions, for her mother and sister.

She spoke about reconstruction, African-Americans&#x27; rights, women&#x27;s right and other issues, like venereal disease in &quot;Between Us Be Truth&quot;, and polygamy in her speech &quot;Whited Sepulchers&quot; in Utah. Although she called for women&#x27;s rights, she was not a speaker for the suffrage movement. Some of her well-received post-war lectures include &quot;For Yourself&quot; and &quot;Platform and Stage&quot; and she frequently spoke about Joan of Arc.


As audiences preferred to be entertained rather than lectured on serious subjects, and after she campaigned for Horace Greeley, a Democratic presidential candidate in 1872, her career as a lecturer declined. In 1873, she and her manager, James Redpath, disagreed and parted company. By 1875, she was unable to support herself by speaking engagements alone. She gave a speech for Republicans for the 1888 presidential election in many states, during which she called Grover Cleveland the &quot;hangman of Buffalo&quot; and vigorously waved a bloody shirt. Due to the performance, they stopped booking her for speaking engagements. Newspapers questioned her sanity. The Republicans filed a breach of contract suit in 1891 and she was never hired by the party again.

=== Mountaineering ===
As her popularity as a lecturer waned, she was invited to Colorado by Ralph Meeker. She arrived in Colorado in 1873. Over the course of three weeks she climbed Pikes Peak, Mount Lincoln, Grays Peak, and Mount Elbert, often using horses or mules. She joined the Hayden survey for a climb of Longs Peak. Dickinson had hoped the publicity would revive her career. Boulder County News reported the at the time scandalous detail that Dickinson had worn trousers for the ascent. Dickinson was the first white woman on record to summit Colorado&#x27;s Gray&#x27;s Peak, Lincoln Peak, and Elbert Peak (on a mule), and she was the second to summit Pike&#x27;s Peak. She was the third white woman on record to climb Colorado’s Longs Peak, in 1873, and was certainly the first well-known woman to do so.

===Author and actress===
As another means of support, she began writing. She published the novel &quot;What Answer?&quot; (1868), that tackled negative viewpoints about interracial marriage. It is considered her most radical work. She argued for technical training for workers, better treatment of prisoners, assistance for the poor, and compulsory education for all children in &quot;A Paying Investment, a Plea for Education&quot; (1876). Dickinson wrote &quot;A Ragged Register of People, Places and Opinions&quot; in 1879.

Her plays included &quot;The Crown of Thorns&quot; (1876), in which she played the role of Anne Boleyn and the play and her acting was unfavorably received in New York. She appeared in the title role of &quot;Mary Tudor&quot; (1878). Her plays included &quot;Aurelian&quot; (1878) and &quot;An American Girl&quot; (1880), which was successfully acted by Fanny Davenport. She performed as Hamlet on Broadway, but she did not have critical success as an actress.

==Personal life==

She was a friend of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Quaker lecturers Lucretia Mott and Susan B. Anthony. In her letters, Anthony sometimes addressed Dickinson as &quot;Chickie Dickie&quot;. Benjamin F. Butler, a Civil War general and a politician, pursued her romantically. He remained her friend, a legal advisor, and source of money over many years. Unpublished correspondence from a woman named Ida appears to show at least one intimate episode with another woman during her life, referencing Dickinson &quot;tempting [Ida] to kiss her sweet mouth,&quot; which historian Lillian Faderman included in her history of lesbian life in America.

In 1870, she was the wage-earner and head of the household of her mother, older sister Susan, and a servant. In 1883, she moved to West Pittston, Pennsylvania, to live with her sister. Over the next years, her health began to fail as she aged and due to many years of poverty. On May 12, 1889, her 95-year-old mother Mary died in West Pittston, Pennsylvania. She was said to have been an invalid for years and cared for by her daughters, writer Susan and lecturer Anna. Mary&#x27;s only living son, Rev. John Dickinson, was a professor of Geology at the University of California at the time.
Dickinson began to exhibit signs of paranoia in 1891 and she was committed against her will to a mental hospital, the Danville State Hospital for the Insane, by her sister Susan Dickinson. She was transferred to a private hospital in Goshen, New York, under the care of Dr. Seward and with support of her friends, due at least in part to newspapers having reported false information about her care. Dickinson, who was taken to Danville in February 1891, stayed at the Interpines sanitarium and was giving lectures by late August that year. She filed suits against the newspapers who claimed she was insane and the people who had her committed. After protracted legal battles, she won the case of illegal kidnapping and three libel suits in 1898. She lost many supporters and friends due to her antagonistic behavior.

Sometime after she was released from Danville, she lived in Goshen, New York, with George and Sallie Ackley, and continued to do so for more than forty years. Dickinson and Sallie Ackley were lovers, according to correspondence between Dickinson and Sallie Ackley and interviews with George Ackley and his sisters. George also said she was a heavy drinker.

When Sallie died, she left $7,000 to Dickinson, with the understanding that upon her death, the remainder would be left to George. Dickinson died in 1932 of cerebral apoplexy. Since she did not leave a will, the remaining $6,000 inheritance went to her distant cousin, rather than to George. Dickinson is buried at Slate Hill Cemetery in Goshen, near George and Sallie&#x27;s headstone.

<text>John Paul Stapp (July 11, 1910 – November 13, 1999) was an American career U.S. Air Force officer, flight surgeon, physician, biophysicist, and pioneer in studying the effects of acceleration forces on humans. He was a colleague and contemporary of Chuck Yeager, and became known as &quot;the fastest man on earth&quot;. His work on Project Manhigh pioneered many developments for the US space program.

==Early years==
Born in Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, Stapp was the eldest of four sons of Reverend Charles Franklin Stapp and Mrs. Mary Louise Shannon, Baptist missionaries. He studied in Texas at Brownwood High School in Brownwood and San Marcos Baptist Academy in San Marcos.

In 1931, Stapp received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Baylor University in Waco, an MA from Baylor in 1932, a PhD in Biophysics from the University of Texas at Austin in 1940, and an MD from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, in 1944. He interned for one year at St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital in Duluth, Minnesota. Stapp was later awarded an honorary Doctor of Science from Baylor University.

==Military career==
Stapp entered the U.S. Army Air Forces on 5 October 1944 as a physician and qualified as a flight surgeon. On 10 August 1946, he was assigned to the Aero Medical Laboratory at Wright Field as a project officer and medical consultant in the Biophysics Branch and transferred to the U.S. Air Force when it became an independent service in September 1947. His first assignment included a series of flights testing various oxygen systems in unpressurized aircraft at 40,000 ft (12.2 km). One of the major problems with high-altitude flight was the danger of &quot;the bends&quot; or decompression sickness. Stapp&#x27;s work resolved that problem as well as many others, which allowed the next generation of high-altitude aircraft and the HALO insertion techniques. He was assigned to the deceleration project in March 1947.

In 1967, the Air Force loaned Stapp to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to conduct auto-safety research. He retired from the U.S. Air Force in 1970 with the rank of Colonel.

== Work on effects of acceleration ==
As early as 1945, service personnel realized the need for a comprehensive and controlled series of studies into the effects of deceleration on the human body. This led to fundamental concepts that could be applied to better safeguard aircraft occupants during a crash. The initial phase of the program, as set up by the Aero Medical Laboratory of the Wright Air Development Center, was to develop equipment and instrumentation. This was so aircraft crashes might be simulated, and to study the strength factors of seats and harnesses. Human tolerance to the deceleration encountered in simulated aircraft crashes could also be simulated.

The first run on the rocket sled took place on 30 April 1947 with ballast. The sled ran off the tracks. The first human run took place the following December. Instrumentation on all the early runs was in the developmental stage, and it was not until August 1948 that it was adequate to begin recording. By August 1948, sixteen human runs had completed, all in the backward-facing position. Forward-facing runs started in August 1949. Most of the earlier tests ran to compare the standard Air Force harnesses with a series of modified harnesses. This was to determine which type gave the best protection to the pilot.

By June 8, 1951, 74 human runs had been made on the decelerator, 19 with the subjects in the backward position, and 55 in the forward position. Stapp, one of the most frequent volunteers on the runs, sustained a fracture of his right wrist during the runs on two separate occasions, also broke ribs, lost fillings from his teeth and developed bleeding into his retinas that caused temporary vision loss; in one run he survived forces up to 38 g.

Stapp&#x27;s research on the decelerator had profound implications for both civilian and military aviation. For instance, the backward-facing seat concept, which was known before, was given great impetus by the crash research program. It proved beyond a doubt that this position was the safest for aircraft passengers and required little harness support, and that a human can withstand much greater deceleration than in the forward position. As a result, many Military Air Transport Service (MATS) aircraft in USAF and carrier on-board delivery aircraft in USN were equipped or retrofitted with this type of seat. Commercial airlines were made aware of these findings, but still use forward-facing seats. The British Royal Air Force also installed it on many of their military transport aircraft.

As a result of Stapp&#x27;s findings, the acceleration requirement for fighter seats was increased considerably up to 32 g (310 m/s²). His work showed that a pilot could walk away from crashes when properly protected by harnesses if the seat does not break loose.

The &quot;side saddle&quot; or sideways-facing harness was also developed by Stapp. The new triangular-shaped harness gave vastly increased protection to fully equipped paratroopers. It was made of nylon mesh webbing, fit snugly over the shoulder facing the forward part of the aircraft. It protected the wearer from the force of crash impacts, takeoffs and landing bumps. It withstood a crash force of approximately of force and was developed to replace the old-fashioned lap belts, which gave inadequate protection to their wearers.

By riding the decelerator sled, in his 29th and last ride at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, Stapp demonstrated that a human can withstand at least 46.2 g (in the forward position, with adequate harnessing). This is the highest known acceleration voluntarily encountered by a human, set on December 10, 1954. Stapp reached a speed of , which broke the land speed record and made him the fastest man on Earth. Stapp believed that the tolerance of humans to acceleration had not yet been reached in tests. He believed it is much greater than thought possible. He said &quot;I felt a sensation in the eyes, somewhat like the extraction of a molar without anesthetic,&quot; but his survival without any permanent injuries supported the development of further safety technologies including the ejection seat.

Also developed by Stapp as an added safety measure was an improved version of the currently used shoulder strap and lap belt. The new high-strength harness withstood 45.4 g (445 m/s²), compared to the 17 g (167 m/s²), which was the limit that could be tolerated with the old combination. Basically, the new pilot harness added an inverted &quot;V&quot; strap crossing the pilot&#x27;s thighs added to the standard lap belt and shoulder straps. The leg and shoulder straps and the lap belt all fastened together at one point, and pressure was distributed evenly over the stronger body surfaces, rather than on the solar plexus, as was the case with the old harness.

== Wind-blast experiments ==
Stapp also participated in wind-blast experiments, in which he flew in jet aircraft at high speeds to determine whether or not it was safe for a pilot to remain with his aircraft if the canopy should accidentally blow off. Stapp stayed with his aircraft at a speed of with the canopy removed, and suffered no injurious effects from the wind blasts. Among these experiments was one of the first high-altitude skydives, executed by Stapp himself. He also supervised research programs in the field of human factors in escape from aircraft.

== Stapp&#x27;s law ==
Stapp was an inveterate collector of aphorisms and adages, kept a logbook of such, and the practice spread to his entire working group. He published a collection of these in 1992. Stapp is credited with being the popularizer, as well as the author of the final form of the principle known as Murphy&#x27;s law, &quot;Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.&quot;

Stapp is credited with creating &quot;Stapp&#x27;s Law&quot; (or &quot;Stapp&#x27;s Ironic Paradox&quot;) during his work on the project. It states: &quot;The universal aptitude for ineptitude makes any human accomplishment an incredible miracle.&quot;

==Awards==

In 1957, he was presented with the Gorgas Medal from the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States (AMSUS).

In 1973 Stapp was awarded the Franklin Institute&#x27;s Elliott Cresson Medal.

In 1979 Stapp was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame. The New Mexico Museum of Space History, which houses the International Space Hall of Fame, includes a John P. Stapp Air &amp; Space Park which holds Sonic Wind No. 1, a rocket sled ridden by Stapp.

In 1985, Stapp was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame for his work in aviation safety.

In 1991, Stapp was awarded the National Medal of Technology, &quot;for his research on the effects of mechanical force on living tissues leading to safety developments in crash protection technology&quot;.

In 2012, 13 years after his death, Stapp was awarded the Air Force Space and Missile Pioneers award. The award recognizes individuals for their significant role in the history of Air Force space and missile programs.

==Later life==
In the years before his death, Stapp was president of the New Mexico Research Institute, headquartered in Alamogordo, New Mexico, as well as chairman of the annual Stapp Car Crash Conference. This event meets to study car crashes and determine ways to make cars safer. In addition, Stapp was honorary chairman of the Stapp Foundation, which is underwritten by General Motors and provides scholarships for automotive engineering students.

Stapp died peacefully at his home in Alamogordo at the age of 89.

<doc id="264051" wikidata="Q2920631" url="?curid=264051" title="History of computing hardware (1960s–present)">
<text>The history of computing hardware starting at 1960 is marked by the conversion from vacuum tube to solid-state devices such as transistors and then integrated circuit (IC) chips. Around 1953 to 1959, discrete transistors started being considered sufficiently reliable and economical that they made further vacuum tube computers uncompetitive. Metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) large-scale integration (LSI) technology subsequently led to the development of semiconductor memory in the mid-to-late 1960s and then the microprocessor in the early 1970s. This led to primary computer memory moving away from magnetic-core memory devices to solid-state static and dynamic semiconductor memory, which greatly reduced the cost, size, and power consumption of computers. These advances led to the miniaturized personal computer (PC) in the 1970s, starting with home computers and desktop computers, followed by laptops and then mobile computers over the next several decades.

== Second generation ==

For the purposes of this article, the term &quot;second generation&quot; refers to computers using discrete transistors, even when the vendors referred to them as &quot;third-generation&quot;. By 1960 transistorized computers were replacing vacuum tube computers, offering lower cost, higher speeds, and reduced power consumption. The marketplace was dominated by &quot;IBM and the seven dwarfs&quot;:

* IBM
* The BUNCH
** Burroughs
** UNIVAC
** NCR
** Control Data Corporation (CDC)
** Honeywell
* General Electric
* RCA.

Some examples of 1960s second generation computers from those vendors are:

* the IBM 1401, the IBM 7090/7094, and the IBM System/360;
* the Burroughs 5000 series;
* the UNIVAC 1107;
* the NCR 315;
* the CDC 1604 and the CDC 3000 series;
* the Honeywell 200, Honeywell 400, and Honeywell 800;
* the GE-400 series and the GE-600 series;
* the RCA 301, 3301, 501, and the Spectra 70 series.

However, some smaller companies made significant contributions. Also, towards the end of the second generation Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) was a serious contender in the small and medium machine marketplace.

Meanwhile, second-generation computers were also being developed in the USSR as, e.g., the Razdan family of general-purpose digital computers created at the Yerevan Computer Research and Development Institute.

The second-generation computer architectures initially varied; they included character-based decimal computers, sign-magnitude decimal computers with a 10-digit word, sign-magnitude binary computers, and ones&#x27; complement binary computers, although Philco, RCA, and Honeywell, for example, had some computers that were character-based binary computers and Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and Philco, for example, had two&#x27;s complement computers. With the advent of the IBM System/360, two&#x27;s complement became the norm for new product lines.

The most common word sizes for binary mainframes were 36 and 48 bits, although entry-level and midrange machines used smaller words, e.g., 12 bits, 18 bits, 24 bits, 30 bits. All but the smallest machines had asynchronous I/O channels and interrupts. Typically binary computers with word size up to 36 bits had one instruction per word, binary computers with 48 bits per word had two instructions per word and the CDC 60-bit machines could have two, three, or four instructions per word, depending on the instruction mix; the Burroughs B5000, B6500/B7500 and B8500 lines are notable exceptions to this.

First-generation computers with data channels (I/O channels) had a basic DMA interface to the channel cable. The second generation saw both simpler, e.g., channels on the CDC 6000 series had no DMA, and more sophisticated designs, e.g., the 7909 on the IBM 7090 had limited computational, conditional branching and interrupt system.

By 1960, magnetic core was the dominant memory technology, although there were still some new machines using drums and delay lines during the 1960s.

Magnetic thin film and rod memory were used on some second-generation machines, but advances in core technology meant they remained niche players until semiconductor memory displaced both core and thin film.

In the first generation, word-oriented computers typically had a single accumulator and an extension, referred to as, e.g., Upper and Lower Accumulator, Accumulator and Multiplier-Quotient (MQ) register. In the second generation, it became common for computers to have multiple addressable accumulators. On some computers, e.g., PDP-6, the same registers served as accumulators and index registers, making them an early example of general-purpose registers.

In the second generation there was considerable development of new address modes, including truncated addressing on, e.g., the Philco TRANSAC S-2000, the UNIVAC III, and automatic index register incrementing on, e.g., the RCA 601, UNIVAC 1107, and the GE-600 series. Although index registers were introduced in the first generation under the name &quot;B-line&quot;, their use became much more common in the second generation. Similarly, indirect addressing became more common in the second generation, either in conjunction with index registers or instead of them. While first-generation computers typically had a small number of index registers or none, several lines of second-generation computers had large numbers of index registers, e.g., Atlas, Bendix G-20, IBM 7070.

The first generation had pioneered the use of special facilities for calling subroutines, e.g., TSX on the IBM 709. In the second generation, such facilities were ubiquitous; some examples are:
; Automatically record the next sequential instruction (NSI) in a register for all or most successful branch instructions
: The Jump Address (JA) Register on the Philco TRANSAC S-2000
: The Sequence History (SH) and Cosequence History (CSH) registers on the Honeywell 800
: The B register on an IBM 1401 with the indexing feature
; Automatically record the NSI at a standard memory location following all or most successful branches
: Store P (STP) locations on RCA 301, 3301 and 501
: STICC on the RCA 601 is relative to the lower bound register
; Call instructions that save the NSI in the first word of the subroutine
: Return Jump (RJ) on the UNIVAC 1107
: Return Jump (RJ) on CDC 3600 and CDC 6000 series
: Jump to Subroutine (JSR) on the DEC PDP-6 and PDP-10
; Call instructions that save the NSI in an implicit or explicit register
: Branch and Load Location in Index Word (BLX) on the IBM 7070
: Transfer and Set indeX (TSX) on the IBM 7090
: Jump and Save PC (JSP) on the DEC PDP-6 and PDP-10
: Transfer and Set Xn (TSXn) on the GE-600 series
: Branch and Link (BAL) on the IBM System/360
; Call instructions that use an index register as a stack pointer and push return information onto the stack
:Push jump (PUSHJ) on the DEC PDP-6
; Implicit call with return information pushed onto the stack
:Program descriptors on the Burroughs B5000 line
: Program descriptors on the Burroughs B6500 line
The second generation saw the introduction of features intended to support multiprogramming and multiprocessor configurations, including master/slave (supervisor/problem) mode, storage protection keys, limit registers, protection associated with address translation, and atomic instructions.

=== Supercomputers ===

Second generation supercomputers were substantially faster than most contemporary mainframes. Some of the technologies developed in order to achieve the desired performance are now used in commodity computers.

== Third generation ==

The mass increase in the use of computers accelerated with &quot;Third Generation&quot; computers starting around 1966 in the commercial market. These generally relied on early (sub-1000 transistor) integrated circuit technology. The third generation ends with the microprocessor-based fourth generation.

In 1958, Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments invented the hybrid integrated circuit (hybrid IC), which had external wire connections, making it difficult to mass-produce. In 1959, Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor invented the monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip. It was made of silicon, whereas Kilby&#x27;s chip was made of germanium. The basis for Noyce&#x27;s monolithic IC was Fairchild&#x27;s planar process, which allowed integrated circuits to be laid out using the same principles as those of printed circuits. The planar process was developed by Noyce&#x27;s colleague Jean Hoerni in early 1959, based on the silicon surface passivation and thermal oxidation processes developed by Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derrick in 1955 and 1957.

Computers using IC chips began to appear in the early 1960s. For example, the 1961 Semiconductor Network Computer (Molecular Electronic Computer, Mol-E-Com), the first monolithic integrated circuit general purpose computer (built for demonstration purposes, programmed to simulate a desk calculator) was built by Texas Instruments for the US Air Force.

Some of their early uses were in embedded systems, notably used by NASA for the Apollo Guidance Computer, by the military in the LGM-30 Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile, the Honeywell ALERT airborne computer, and in the Central Air Data Computer used for flight control in the US Navy&#x27;s F-14A Tomcat fighter jet.

An early commercial use was the 1965 SDS 92. IBM first used ICs in computers for the logic of the System/360 Model 85 shipped in 1969 and then made extensive use of ICs in its System/370 which began shipment in 1971.

The integrated circuit enabled the development of much smaller computers. The minicomputer was a significant innovation in the 1960s and 1970s. It brought computing power to more people, not only through more convenient physical size but also through broadening the computer vendor field. Digital Equipment Corporation became the number two computer company behind IBM with their popular PDP and VAX computer systems. Smaller, affordable hardware also brought about the development of important new operating systems such as Unix.

In November 1966, Hewlett-Packard introduced the 2116A minicomputer, one of the first commercial 16-bit computers. It used CTμL (Complementary Transistor MicroLogic) in integrated circuits from Fairchild Semiconductor. Hewlett-Packard followed this with similar 16-bit computers, such as the 2115A in 1967, the 2114A in 1968, and others.

In 1969, Data General introduced the Nova and shipped a total of 50,000 at $8,000 each. The popularity of 16-bit computers, such as the Hewlett-Packard 21xx series and the Data General Nova, led the way toward word lengths that were multiples of the 8-bit byte. The Nova was first to employ medium-scale integration (MSI) circuits from Fairchild Semiconductor, with subsequent models using large-scale integrated (LSI) circuits. Also notable was that the entire central processor was contained on one 15-inch printed circuit board.

Large mainframe computers used ICs to increase storage and processing abilities. The 1965 IBM System/360 mainframe computer family are sometimes called third-generation computers; however, their logic consisted primarily of SLT hybrid circuits, which contained discrete transistors and diodes interconnected on a substrate with printed wires and printed passive components; the S/360 M85 and M91 did use ICs for some of their circuits. IBM&#x27;s 1971 System/370 used ICs for their logic, and later models used semiconductor memory.

By 1971, the ILLIAC IV supercomputer was the fastest computer in the world, using about a quarter-million small-scale ECL logic gate integrated circuits to make up sixty-four parallel data processors.

Third-generation computers were offered well into the 1990s; for example the IBM ES9000 9X2 announced April 1994 used 5,960 ECL chips to make a 10-way processor. Other third-generation computers offered in the 1990s included the DEC VAX 9000 (1989), built from ECL gate arrays and custom chips, and the Cray T90 (1995).

== Fourth generation ==
Third-generation minicomputers were essentially scaled-down versions of mainframe computers, designed to perform similar tasks but on a smaller and more accessible scale. In contrast, the fourth generation&#x27;s origins are fundamentally different, as it is based on the microprocessor—a computer processor integrated onto a single large-scale integration (LSI) MOS integrated circuit chip.

Microprocessor-based computers were originally very limited in their computational ability and speed and were in no way an attempt to downsize the minicomputer. They were addressing an entirely different market.

Processing power and storage capacities have grown beyond all recognition since the 1970s, but the underlying technology has remained basically the same of large-scale integration (LSI) or very-large-scale integration (VLSI) microchips, so it is widely regarded that most of today&#x27;s computers still belong to the fourth generation.

=== Microprocessors ===

The microprocessor has origins in the MOS integrated circuit (MOS IC) chip. The MOS IC was fabricated by Fred Heiman and Steven Hofstein at RCA in 1962. Due to rapid MOSFET scaling, MOS IC chips rapidly increased in complexity at a rate predicted by Moore&#x27;s law, leading to large-scale integration (LSI) with hundreds of transistors on a single MOS chip by the late 1960s. The application of MOS LSI chips to computing was the basis for the first microprocessors, as engineers began recognizing that a complete computer processor could be contained on a single MOS LSI chip.

The earliest multi-chip microprocessors were the Four-Phase Systems AL1 in 1969 and Garrett AiResearch MP944 in 1970, each using several MOS LSI chips. On November 15, 1971, Intel released the world&#x27;s first single-chip microprocessor, the 4004, on a single MOS LSI chip. Its development was led by Federico Faggin, using silicon-gate MOS technology, along with Ted Hoff, Stanley Mazor and Masatoshi Shima. It was developed for a Japanese calculator company called Busicom as an alternative to hardwired circuitry, but computers were developed around it, with much of their processing abilities provided by one small microprocessor chip. The dynamic RAM (DRAM) chip was based on the MOS DRAM memory cell developed by Robert Dennard of IBM, offering kilobits of memory on one chip. Intel coupled the RAM chip with the microprocessor, allowing fourth generation computers to be smaller and faster than prior computers. The 4004 was only capable of 60,000 instructions per second, but its successors brought ever-growing speed and power to computers, including the Intel 8008, 8080 (used in many computers using the CP/M operating system), and the 8086/8088 family. (The IBM personal computer (PC) and compatibles use processors that are still backward-compatible with the 8086.) Other producers also made microprocessors which were widely used in microcomputers.

The following table shows a timeline of significant microprocessor development.

=== Supercomputers ===
The powerful supercomputers of the era were at the other end of the computing spectrum from the microcomputers, and they also used integrated circuit technology. In 1976, the Cray-1 was developed by Seymour Cray, who had left Control Data in 1972 to form his own company. This machine was the first supercomputer to make vector processing practical. It had a characteristic horseshoe shape to speed processing by shortening circuit paths. Vector processing uses one instruction to perform the same operation on many arguments; it has been a fundamental supercomputer processing method ever since. The Cray-1 could calculate 150 million floating-point operations per second (150 megaflops). 85 were shipped at a price of $5 million each. The Cray-1 had a CPU that was mostly constructed of SSI and MSI ECL ICs.

== Mainframes and minicomputers ==

Computers were generally large, costly systems owned by large institutions before the introduction of the microprocessor in the early 1970s—corporations, universities, government agencies, and the like. Users were experienced specialists who did not usually interact with the machine itself, but instead prepared tasks for the computer on off-line equipment, such as card punches. A number of assignments for the computer would be gathered up and processed in batch mode. After the jobs had completed, users could collect the output printouts and punched cards. In some organizations, it could take hours or days between submitting a job to the computing center and receiving the output.

A more interactive form of computer use developed commercially by the middle 1960s. In a time-sharing system, multiple teleprinter and display terminals let many people share the use of one mainframe computer processor, with the operating system assigning time slices to each user&#x27;s jobs. This was common in business applications and in science and engineering.

A different model of computer use was foreshadowed by the way in which early, pre-commercial, experimental computers were used, where one user had exclusive use of a processor. Some of the first computers that might be called &quot;personal&quot; were early minicomputers such as the LINC and PDP-8, and later on VAX and larger minicomputers from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), Data General, Prime Computer, and others. They originated as peripheral processors for mainframe computers, taking on some routine tasks and freeing the processor for computation.

By today&#x27;s standards, they were physically large (about the size of a refrigerator) and costly (typically tens of thousands of US dollars), and thus were rarely purchased by individuals. However, they were much smaller, less expensive, and generally simpler to operate than the mainframe computers of the time, and thus affordable by individual laboratories and research projects. Minicomputers largely freed these organizations from the batch processing and bureaucracy of a commercial or university computing center.

In addition, minicomputers were more interactive than mainframes, and soon had their own operating systems. The minicomputer Xerox Alto (1973) was a landmark step in the development of personal computers, because of its graphical user interface, bit-mapped high-resolution screen, large internal and external memory storage, mouse, and special software.

== Microcomputers ==
=== Microprocessor and cost reduction ===
In the minicomputer ancestors of the modern personal computer, processing was carried out by circuits with large numbers of components arranged on multiple large printed circuit boards. Minicomputers were consequently physically large and expensive to produce compared with later microprocessor systems. After the &quot;computer-on-a-chip&quot; was commercialized, the cost to produce a computer system dropped dramatically. The arithmetic, logic, and control functions that previously occupied several costly circuit boards were now available in one integrated circuit which was very expensive to design but cheap to produce in large quantities. Concurrently, advances in developing solid state memory eliminated the bulky, costly, and power-hungry magnetic-core memory used in prior generations of computers.

=== Micral N ===
In France, the company R2E (Réalisations et Etudes Electroniques) formed by five former engineers of the Intertechnique company, André Truong Trong Thi and François Gernelle introduced in February 1973 a microcomputer, the Micral N based on the Intel 8008.
Originally, the computer had been designed by Gernelle, Lacombe, Beckmann and Benchitrite for the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique to automate hygrometric measurements. The Micral N cost a fifth of the price of a PDP-8, about 8500FF ($1300).
The clock of the Intel 8008 was set at 500 kHz, the memory was 16 kilobytes.
A bus, called Pluribus was introduced and allowed connection of up to 14 boards.
Different boards for digital I/O, analog I/O, memory, floppy disk were available from R2E.

=== Altair 8800 and IMSAI 8080 ===
The development of the single-chip microprocessor was an enormous catalyst to the popularization of cheap, easy to use, and truly personal computers. The Altair 8800, introduced in a &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; magazine article in the January 1975 issue, at the time set a new low price point for a computer, bringing computer ownership to an admittedly select market in the 1970s. This was followed by the IMSAI 8080 computer, with similar abilities and limitations. The Altair and IMSAI were essentially scaled-down minicomputers and were incomplete: to connect a keyboard or teleprinter to them required heavy, expensive &quot;peripherals&quot;. These machines both featured a front panel with switches and lights, which communicated with the operator in binary. To program the machine after switching it on the bootstrap loader program had to be entered, without error, in binary, then a paper tape containing a BASIC interpreter loaded from a paper-tape reader. Keying the loader required setting a bank of eight switches up or down and pressing the &quot;load&quot; button, once for each byte of the program, which was typically hundreds of bytes long. The computer could run BASIC programs once the interpreter had been loaded.
The MITS Altair, the first commercially successful microprocessor kit, was featured on the cover of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; magazine in January 1975. It was the world&#x27;s first mass-produced personal computer kit, as well as the first computer to use an Intel 8080 processor. It was a commercial success with 10,000 Altairs being shipped. The Altair also inspired the software development efforts of Paul Allen and his high school friend Bill Gates who developed a BASIC interpreter for the Altair, and then formed Microsoft.

The MITS Altair 8800 effectively created a new industry of microcomputers and computer kits, with many others following, such as a wave of small business computers in the late 1970s based on the Intel 8080, Zilog Z80 and Intel 8085 microprocessor chips. Most ran the CP/M-80 operating system developed by Gary Kildall at Digital Research. CP/M-80 was the first popular microcomputer operating system to be used by many different hardware vendors, and many software packages were written for it, such as WordStar and dBase II.

Many hobbyists during the mid-1970s designed their own systems, with various degrees of success, and sometimes banded together to ease the job. Out of these house meetings, the Homebrew Computer Club developed, where hobbyists met to talk about what they had done, exchange schematics and software, and demonstrate their systems. Many people built or assembled their own computers as per published designs. For example, many thousands of people built the Galaksija home computer later in the early 1980s.

The Altair was influential. It came before Apple Computer, as well as Microsoft which produced and sold the Altair BASIC programming language interpreter, Microsoft&#x27;s first product. The second generation of microcomputers, those that appeared in the late 1970s, sparked by the unexpected demand for the kit computers at the electronic hobbyist clubs, were usually known as home computers. For business use these systems were less capable and in some ways less versatile than the large business computers of the day. They were designed for fun and educational purposes, not so much for practical use. And although you could use some simple office/productivity applications on them, they were generally used by computer enthusiasts for learning to program and for running computer games, for which the personal computers of the period were less suitable and much too expensive. For the more technical hobbyists home computers were also used for electronically interfacing to external devices, such as controlling model railroads, and other general hobbyist pursuits.

===Microcomputer emerges===

The advent of the microprocessor and solid-state memory made home computing affordable. Early hobby microcomputer systems such as the Altair 8800 and Apple I introduced around 1975 marked the release of low-cost 8-bit processor chips, which had sufficient computing power to be of interest to hobby and experimental users. By 1977 pre-assembled systems such as the Apple II, Commodore PET, and TRS-80 (later dubbed the &quot;1977 Trinity&quot; by &quot;Byte&quot; Magazine) began the era of mass-market home computers; much less effort was required to obtain an operating computer, and applications such as games, word processing, and spreadsheets began to proliferate. Distinct from computers used in homes, small business systems were typically based on CP/M, until IBM introduced the IBM PC, which was quickly adopted. The PC was heavily cloned, leading to mass production and consequent cost reduction throughout the 1980s. This expanded the PC&#x27;s presence in homes, replacing the home computer category during the 1990s and leading to the current monoculture of architecturally identical personal computers.

<text>Raymond Albert Kroc (October 5, 1902 – January 14, 1984) was an American businessman, widely regarded as the &quot;Founder of McDonald&#x27;s&quot; for his role in turning the singular hamburger stand into the most successful global fast food corporation by revenue. He purchased McDonald&#x27;s from the McDonald Brothers in 1961, after several years as their franchising agent, and served as its CEO from 1967 to 1973.

Kroc was born in Oak Park, Illinois, and worked a variety of jobs, including as a paper cup salesman and a musician, before eventually becoming a milkshake mixer salesman. In 1954, he visited a hamburger restaurant in San Bernardino, California, owned by Richard and Maurice McDonald. Kroc was impressed with the efficiency and speed of the restaurant&#x27;s operations, and he convinced the brothers to allow him to franchise the concept.

Under Kroc&#x27;s leadership, McDonald&#x27;s grew rapidly due to Kroc&#x27;s focus on aggressive expansion, opening new restaurants across the United States and eventually internationally. Kroc became the owner of McDonald&#x27;s Corporation in 1961 and was credited as its founder. After retiring from McDonald&#x27;s, he owned the Major League Baseball team San Diego Padres from 1974 until his death in 1984.

==Early life==
Raymond Albert Kroc was born on October 5, 1902, in Oak Park, Illinois, near Chicago, to Czech-American parents, Rose Mary [&quot;née&quot; Hrach] (1881–1959) and Alois &quot;Louis&quot; Kroc (1879–1937). Alois was born in Horní Stupno, part of Břasy near Rokycany. Rose&#x27;s father Vojtěch was from Ševětín and her maternal grandfather Josef Kotilínek was from Bořice. After emigrating to America, Alois made a fortune speculating on land during the 1920s, only to lose everything with the stock market crash in 1929.

At the age of 15, Kroc made the decision to leave high school, contrary to his parents&#x27; wishes. Following the United States&#x27; entry into World War I, he lied about his age in order to enlist with the American Red Cross as an ambulance driver. However, his service was short-lived, as the war concluded shortly after his enlistment. During the 1920s and throughout the Great Depression, Kroc worked a variety of jobs, including a paper-cup salesman, a Florida real estate agent, and a pianist in multiple bands.

==McDonald&#x27;s==

After World War II, Kroc found employment as a milkshake mixer salesman for the foodservice equipment manufacturer Prince Castle. When Prince Castle mixers sales plummeted because of competition from lower-priced Hamilton Beach products, Kroc was intrigued by Richard and Maurice McDonald, who had purchased eight of his mixers for their restaurant in San Bernardino, California. Kroc visited the brothers in 1954 to see why they were making so many milkshakes.

After finalizing a franchise agreement with the McDonald brothers, Kroc sent a letter to Walt Disney. They had met as ambulance attendant trainees in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, during World War I. Kroc wrote, &quot;I have very recently taken over the national franchise of the McDonald&#x27;s system. I would like to inquire if there may be an opportunity for a McDonald&#x27;s in your Disney Development.&quot; According to one account, Disney agreed but with a stipulation to increase the price of fries from ten cents to fifteen cents, allowing himself the profit. Kroc refused to gouge his loyal customers, leaving Disneyland to open without a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant. Writer Eric Schlosser, writing in his book &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot;, believes that this is a doctored retelling of the transaction by some McDonald&#x27;s marketing executives. The proposal was likely returned without approval.

Kroc has been credited with making a number of innovative changes in the food-service franchise model. Chief among them was the sale of only single-store franchises instead of selling larger, territorial franchises which was common in the industry at the time. Kroc recognized that the sale of exclusive licenses for large markets was the quickest way for a franchisor to make money, but he also saw in the practice a loss in the franchisor&#x27;s ability to exert control over the course and direction of a chain&#x27;s development. Above all else, and in keeping with contractual obligations with the McDonald brothers, Kroc wanted uniformity in service and quality among all of the McDonald&#x27;s locations. Without the ability to influence franchisees, Kroc knew that it would be difficult to achieve that goal. By granting a franchisee the right to only one store location at a time, Kroc retained for the franchise some measure of control over the franchisee, or at least those desiring to someday own the rights to another store.

Kroc became frustrated with the McDonald brothers&#x27; desire to maintain a small number of restaurants. The brothers also consistently told Kroc he could not make changes to things such as the original blueprint, but despite Kroc&#x27;s pleas, the brothers never sent any formal letters that legally allowed the changes in the chain. In 1961, he bought the company for $2.7 million, the figure that the brothers gave him when pressed for an amount. Kroc went &quot;ballistic&quot; over hearing the amount and asked if he could pay it incrementally, but the brothers refused. Obtaining the funds for the buyout was difficult due to existing debt from expansion. However, Harry Sonneborn, whom Kroc referred to as his &quot;financial wizard&quot;, was able to raise the required funds.

At the closing, Kroc became annoyed that the brothers would not transfer to him the real estate and rights to the original San Bernardino location. The brothers had told Kroc they were giving the operation, property and all, to the founding employees. In his anger, Kroc later opened a new McDonald&#x27;s restaurant near the original McDonald&#x27;s, which had been renamed the Big M because the brothers had neglected to retain rights to the name. Kroc felt that no one would want to eat at a restaurant called &quot;Kroc&#x27;s&quot; and therefore was adamant about obtaining the rights to &quot;McDonald&#x27;s&quot;. 

After Kroc opened the nearby McDonald&#x27;s, the Big M eventually closed. It is alleged that as part of the buyout Kroc promised, based on a handshake agreement, to continue the annual 1% royalty of the original agreement, but there is no evidence of this beyond a claim by a nephew of the McDonald brothers. Neither of the brothers publicly expressed disappointment over the deal. Speaking to someone about the buyout, Richard McDonald reportedly said that he had no regrets.

Kroc maintained the assembly line &quot;Speedee Service System&quot; for hamburger preparation that was introduced by the McDonald brothers in 1948. He standardized operations, ensuring every burger would taste the same in every restaurant. He set strict rules for franchisees on how the food was to be made, portion sizes, cooking methods and times, and packaging. Kroc also rejected cost-cutting measures like using soybean filler in the hamburger patties. These strict rules also were applied to customer service standards with such mandates that money be refunded to clients whose orders were not correct or to customers who had to wait more than five minutes for their food.

By the time of Kroc&#x27;s death in 1984, McDonald&#x27;s had 7,500 outlets in the United States and in 31 other countries and territories. The total system-wide sales of its restaurants were more than $8 billion in 1983, and his personal fortune amounted to some $600 million.

==Baseball==
Kroc retired from running McDonald&#x27;s in 1973. While he was looking for new challenges, he decided to return to baseball, which was his lifelong favorite sport. One day, while sitting in his yacht in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, he read in the newspaper that the San Diego Padres were for sale. The team had been conditionally sold to Joseph Danzansky, a Washington, D.C. grocery-chain owner, who planned to move the Padres to Washington. However, the sale was tied up in lawsuits when Kroc purchased the team for $12 million, keeping the team in San Diego. In Kroc&#x27;s first year of ownership in 1974, the Padres lost 102 games yet drew over one million in attendance, the standard of box office success in the major leagues during that era. Their previous highest attendance figure was 644,772 in 1972. The &quot;San Diego Union&quot; said Kroc was &quot;above all, a fan of his team&quot;.

On April 9, 1974, while the Padres were on the brink of losing a 9–5 decision to the Houston Astros in the season opener at San Diego Stadium, Kroc took the public address microphone in front of 39,083 fans. &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen such stupid ballplaying in my life,&quot; he said. The crowd cheered in approval. In 1979, Kroc&#x27;s public interest in future free agent players Graig Nettles and Joe Morgan drew a $100,000 fine from Commissioner Bowie Kuhn. Frustrated with the team, he handed over operations of the team to his stepson-in-law, Ballard Smith. &quot;There&#x27;s more future in hamburgers than baseball,&quot; Kroc said.

After his death, the Padres in 1984 wore a special patch with Kroc&#x27;s initials: RAK. They won the NL pennant that year against his hometown team Chicago Cubs and played in the 1984 World Series, which they lost to the Detroit Tigers. Kroc was inducted posthumously as part of the inaugural class of the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame in 1999.

==Personal life==
The Kroc Foundation supported research, treatment and education about various medical conditions, such as alcoholism, diabetes, arthritis and multiple sclerosis. It is best known for establishing the Ronald McDonald House, a nonprofit organization that provides free housing for parents close to medical facilities where their children are receiving treatment.

In 1973, Kroc received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

A lifelong Republican, Kroc believed firmly in self-reliance and staunchly opposed government welfare and the New Deal. Kroc donated $255,000 to Richard Nixon&#x27;s reelection campaign in 1972, and he was controversially accused by some, notably Senator Harrison Williams, of making the donation to influence Nixon to veto a minimum wage bill making its way through Congress.

Kroc&#x27;s first two marriages to Ethel Fleming (1922–1961) and Jane Dobbins Green (1963–1968) ended in divorce. Kroc and Fleming met in 1919, married in 1922, and then moved to Chicago, Illinois. Their daughter Marilyn was born in 1924. He married his third wife, Joan Smith (née Mansfield) in 1969. Joan Kroc was a philanthropist who significantly increased her charitable contributions after Ray Kroc&#x27;s death. She donated to a variety of causes that interested her, such as the promotion of peace and preventing nuclear proliferation. Upon her death in 2003, her remaining $2.7 billion estate was distributed among a number of nonprofit organizations, including $1.5 billion donation to The Salvation Army to build 26 Kroc Centers, along with a $200 million donation to National Public Radio as she believed deeply in the power of public radio. In addition to that, she also donated to community centers serving socially deprived neighborhoods throughout the country.

In 1980, following a stroke, Kroc entered an alcohol rehabilitation facility. He died four years later of heart failure at a hospital in San Diego on January 14, 1984, at the age of 81. He was buried at the El Camino Memorial Park in Sorrento Valley, San Diego.

==In popular culture==
Kroc&#x27;s acquisition of the McDonald&#x27;s franchise as well as his &quot;Kroc-style&quot; business tactics are the subject of Mark Knopfler&#x27;s 2004 song &quot;Boom, Like That&quot;.

Kroc co-authored the book &quot;Grinding It Out&quot;, first published in 1977 and reissued in 2016; it served as the basis for a biographical movie about Kroc.

Michael Keaton portrayed Kroc in the 2016 John Lee Hancock film &quot;The Founder&quot;. The film&#x27;s depiction of Kroc&#x27;s franchise development, nationwide expansion, and ultimate acquisition of McDonald&#x27;s, offered a critical view of his treatment of the founding McDonald brothers.

Kroc is featured in the documentary series &quot;The Food That Built America&quot; on the History channel.

Kroc is featured in Tim Harford&#x27;s BBC World Service radio show &quot;50 Things That Made the Modern Economy&quot; in the episode, &quot;Fast food franchise&quot;, which depicts the boom that his franchisee model provided for the fast food industry.

Kroc was critical of workers sitting or leaning while at work. In the 1960s, Kroc used the catchphrase &quot;If you’ve got time to lean, you’ve got time to clean.&quot; According to &quot;Jacobin&quot; writer Alex N. Press, the catchphrase has become popular with managers.

<doc id="264061" wikidata="Q489" url="?curid=264061" title="Bill Maher">
<text>William Maher ( ; born January 20, 1956) is an American comedian, writer, producer, political commentator, actor, and television host. He is popularly known for the HBO political talk show &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot; (2003–present) and the similar late-night show called &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; (1993–2002), originally on Comedy Central and later on ABC. In 2022, Maher started the podcast &quot;Club Random&quot;.

Maher is best known for his political satire and sociopolitical commentary. He targets many topics including religion, political correctness, and the mass media. His critical views of religion were the basis for his 2008 documentary film &quot;Religulous&quot;. He is a supporter of animal rights, having served on the board of PETA since 1997, and is an advisory board member of Project Reason. Maher supports the legalization of cannabis, serving on the advisory board of NORML.

In 2005, Maher ranked at No. 38 on Comedy Central&#x27;s 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all time. He received a Hollywood Walk of Fame star in 2010. Maher has earned 41 Primetime Emmy Award nominations and a win for his work as executive producer for &quot;Vice&quot; in 2014. He has also received nominations for two Grammy Awards and a Tony Award.

==Early life and education==
Maher was born in New York City. His father, William Aloysius Maher Jr., was a network news editor and radio announcer, and his mother, Julie Maher (née Berman), was a nurse. He was raised in his Irish-American father&#x27;s Roman Catholic religion. Until his early teens, he was unaware that his mother, whose family was from Hungary, was Jewish. Owing to his disagreement with the Catholic Church&#x27;s doctrine about birth control, Maher&#x27;s father stopped taking Maher and his sister to Catholic Mass when Maher was thirteen.

Maher was raised in River Vale, New Jersey, and graduated from Pascack Hills High School in Montvale in 1974. He then attended Cornell University, where he double-majored in English and history, and graduated in 1978. Maher has said, &quot;Selling pot allowed me to get through college and make enough money to start off in comedy.&quot;

==Career==
===Early career===
Maher began his career as a comedian and actor. He was host of the New York City comedy club Catch a Rising Star in 1979. Maher began appearing on Johnny Carson&#x27;s and David Letterman&#x27;s shows in 1982. He made limited television appearances including on &quot;Sara&quot; (1985), &quot;Max Headroom&quot; (1987), &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; (1989, 1990), and &quot;Charlie Hoover&quot; (1991). His feature film debut was in &quot;D.C. Cab&quot; (1983). He later appeared in &quot;Ratboy&quot; (1986), &quot;House II: The Second Story&quot; (1987), &quot;Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death&quot; (1988), &quot;Newhart&quot; (1988), hosted the talk show &quot;Midnight Hour&quot; on CBS (1990) and &quot;Pizza Man&quot; (1991).

===Television career===
====&quot;Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher&quot;====

Maher assumed the host role on &quot;Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher&quot;, a late-night political talk show that ran on Comedy Central from 1993 to 1997 and on ABC from 1997 to 2002. The show regularly began with a topical monologue by Maher preceding the introduction of four guests, usually a diverse group of individuals, such as show business, popular culture, political pundits, political consultants, authors, and occasionally news figures. The group would discuss topical issues selected by Maher, who also participated in the discussions. Jerry Seinfeld, a regular guest on the show, stated that &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; reminded him of talk shows from the 1950s and &#x27;60s &quot;when guests interacted with each other as much as with the host&quot;.

&quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; won an array of awards, including an Emmy Award for Outstanding Technical Direction, two CableACE awards for Best Talk Show Series, and a Genesis Award for Best Television Talk Show. Maher earned numerous award nominations for his producing, writing, and hosting of &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;, including ten Emmy nominations, two TV Guide nominations, and two Writers Guild nominations. ABC decided against renewing Maher&#x27;s contract for &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; in 2002, after he made a controversial on-air remark six days after the September 11 attacks. He agreed with his guest, conservative pundit Dinesh D&#x27;Souza, that the 9/11 terrorists did not act in a cowardly manner (in rebuttal to President Bush&#x27;s statement calling them cowards). Maher said, &quot;We have been the cowards. Lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away. That&#x27;s cowardly. Staying in the airplane when it hits the building. Say what you want about it. Not cowardly. You&#x27;re right.&quot; Maher later clarified that his comment was not anti-military in any way whatsoever, referencing his well-documented longstanding support for the American military. After receiving complaints, FedEx and Sears pulled their advertisements from the show, costing the show significant revenue.

Maher&#x27;s remarks after 9/11 were not the first time he had sparked controversy on &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;. In the same year, he expressed his deep regrets and apologized after being widely criticized for comparing his dogs to mentally disabled children. The show was canceled on June 16, 2002; the Sinclair Broadcast Group had dropped the show from its ABC-affiliated stations several months earlier. On June 22, 2002, six days after the cancellation of &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;, Maher received the Los Angeles Press Club president&#x27;s award (for &quot;championing free speech&quot;). Maher was on the board of judges for the 2002 PEN/Newman&#x27;s Own First Amendment Award, which included writer Vanessa Leggett, imprisoned for 168 days for protecting sources and research notes.

====&quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;====

In 2003, Maher became the host, co-producer, and co-writer of &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;, a weekly hour-long political comedy talk show on the cable television network HBO. In 2016, HBO renewed &quot;Real Time&quot; through 2018, for its 15th and 16th seasons. During an interview, Maher told Terry Gross (on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Fresh Air&quot;) that he much prefers having serious and well-informed guests on his program, as opposed to the random celebrities that fleshed out his roundtable discussions on &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;.

As with his previous show, &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;, Maher begins &quot;Real Time&quot; with a comic opening monologue based upon current events and other topical issues. He proceeds to a one-on-one interview with a guest, either in-studio or via satellite. Following the interview, Maher sits with two or three panelists—usually consisting of pundits, authors, activists, actors, politicians, and journalists—for a discussion of the week&#x27;s events.

&quot;Real Time&quot; has earned widespread praise. It has been nominated for more than ten Primetime Emmy Awards and six Writer&#x27;s Guild awards. In 2007, Maher and his co-producers were awarded the Television Producer of the Year Award in Variety Television by the Producers Guild of America. Maher holds the record for the most Emmy nominations without a win, having been nominated on 22 occasions and not winning once. Eleven of the nominations were for &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;, while nine were for &quot;Real Time&quot;. The other two were nominations for two of his HBO comedy specials: &quot;I&#x27;m Swiss&quot; and &quot;Bill Maher: The Decider&quot;.

===Political commentator===
Maher is a frequent commentator on various cable news networks, including CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, and HLN. Maher has regularly appeared on CNN&#x27;s &quot;The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer&quot; and has also been a frequent guest on MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Hardball with Chris Matthews&quot;, &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot;, and &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;. Maher has also appeared as a guest on HLN&#x27;s &quot;The Joy Behar Show&quot;. He wrote the foreword for the 2002 book, &quot;Spin This!: All the Ways We Don&#x27;t Tell the Truth&quot; by show host Bill Press.

Maher hosted the January 13, 2006, edition of &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, on which he was a frequent guest. Maher appeared as a special guest on the June 29, 2010, edition of the show, on which CNN anchor Larry King announced his retirement. Maher co-emceed the final show of &quot;Larry King Live&quot; on December 16, 2010, with Ryan Seacrest.

===Other work===
In 2004, Maher appeared on stage as Satan in The Steve Allen Theater production of &quot;Hollywood Hell House&quot;, a spoof of Christian-run hell houses. The show was a faithful reproduction of an evangelistic scare-experience written by Reverend Keenan Roberts to terrify teenagers into declaring themselves Christians. &quot;Our faith is that putting this up as itself, it will hoist itself on its own petard, that it&#x27;s comical just as it is,&quot; explained producer Maggie Rowe. The show featured a rotating cast of over 160 celebrities, including Andy Richter (Jesus), Richard Belzer, Dave Thomas, Traci Lords, Craig Bierko, Sarah Silverman, and Julia Sweeney. Maher and director Larry Charles teamed up to make the movie &quot;Religulous&quot;, described by trade publication &quot;Variety&quot; as a documentary &quot;that spoofs religious extremism across the world&quot;. It was released on October 3, 2008.

In 2013, Maher became one of the executive producers for the HBO newsmagazine series &quot;Vice&quot;. Also in 2013, Maher appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and offered to pay $5 million to a charity if Donald Trump would produce his birth certificate to prove that Trump&#x27;s mother had not mated with an orangutan. Maher said this in response to Trump having previously challenged President Barack Obama to produce his birth certificate, and having offered $5 million payable to a charity of Obama&#x27;s choice if Obama would produce his college applications, transcripts, and passport records.

In response to Maher&#x27;s offer, Trump produced his birth certificate, and then Trump launched a lawsuit after Maher was not forthcoming, claiming that Maher&#x27;s $5 million offer was legally binding. &quot;I don&#x27;t think he was joking&quot;, Trump said. &quot;He said it with venom.&quot; Trump withdrew his lawsuit against the comedian after eight weeks.

On May 13, 2016, Maher and his friend Michael Moore announced on YouTube that they are going to make a movie called &quot;The Kings of Atheism&quot;.

On March 21, 2022, Maher launched a podcast titled &quot;Club Random&quot;, a series hosting one-on-one interviews with guests, recorded in his bar at home, where he discusses everything except politics. Guests have included Quentin Tarantino, Jimmy Kimmel, Bella Thorne, Judd Apatow, Mike Tyson, Killer Mike, and William Shatner. In February 2024, Maher revealed that he decided not to release a two-hour interview with Kanye West recorded for &quot;Club Random&quot; because of the rapper&#x27;s recent antisemitic comments. In March 2024, Maher announced that he was starting a podcast network with Chris Casey and Chuck LaBella called Club Random Studios. On March 15, 2024, it was revealed that Maher ended his affiliation with the CAA talent agency after being snubbed from Bryan Lourd&#x27;s private Oscar party. In May 2024, Maher told Jerry Seinfeld on the &quot;Club Random&quot; podcast that &quot;after this year, I&#x27;m going to stop doing [stand-up]&quot;.

On July 19, 2024, it was confirmed that Maher would now be represented in all areas of entertainment by WME.

==Political views==

Maher often eschews political labels, referring to himself as &quot;practical&quot;; however, he has generally held moderately liberal views over the years. Maher stands against political correctness. In his words, &quot;The difference is that liberals protect people, and P.C. people protect feelings.&quot; In the past, he has also described himself as a libertarian, and has also referred to himself &quot;as a progressive, as a sane person&quot;. In a 2012 panel discussion with Salman Rushdie, Maher counted himself, Rushdie, and others such as Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris as &quot;9/11 liberals&quot;, noting that they differentiate themselves from many mainstream liberals in saying that not all religions are alike and that they are not bigoted in criticizing a particular religion. He said in a later interview: &quot;It&#x27;s ridiculous to label criticism of a religion as a phobia of a religion. I&#x27;m going to criticize any person or group that violates liberal principles...&quot;

Maher favors the ending of corporate welfare and federal funding of non-profits; he also favors the legalization of gambling, prostitution, and cannabis. Maher also supports the death penalty. Maher describes himself as an environmentalist, and he has spoken in favor of the Kyoto treaty on global warming on his show &quot;Real Time&quot;. He often criticizes industry figures involved in environmental pollution. He is a board member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. The comedian has noted the paradox of people claiming they distrusted &quot;elite&quot; politicians while at the same time wanting elite doctors to treat them and elite lawyers to represent them in court.

=== Candidates and endorsements ===
Maher considers himself to be at odds with both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Maher announced his support for U.S. Senator Barack Obama (D-IL). Although Maher welcomed Obama&#x27;s electoral victory, he soon became critical of the new president for not acting more boldly on health care reform and other progressive issues. On February 23, 2012, after his &quot;Crazy Stupid Politics&quot; special streamed on Yahoo! Screen, Maher announced that he was contributing $1 million to Priorities USA, the Obama SuperPAC. Maher has voted for Bob Dole and Ralph Nader.

In the lead-up to the 2014 midterm elections, Maher conducted a &quot;Flip a District&quot; contest on his HBO show. His audience was asked to select one &quot;terrible, entrenched&quot; member of Congress in a close election race—&quot;the loserest loser of all&quot;—to remove from office. Maher aimed to help oust that representative by shining a &quot;national spotlight&quot; on the politician during segments of his show and stand-up comedy appearances in that member&#x27;s district during the Fall election. Maher ultimately selected Republican Representative John Kline from Minnesota&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, but he failed to prevent him from winning against his Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party opponent Mike Obermueller.

In the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Maher initially endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders on February 5, 2016. Maher later announced his support for Hillary Clinton after Clinton won the nomination from the Democratic Party primary elections in June 2016. In October 2016, Maher criticized WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange for publishing leaks from the DNC&#x27;s emails, saying: &quot;I really feel like he&#x27;s lost his way a little, and he hates Hillary.&quot; On March 31, 2017, following her defeat, Maher responded on air to suggestions Clinton was ready to end her low profile and speak out: &quot;Hillary, stay in the woods. Okay. You had your shot. You fucked it up. You&#x27;re Bill Buckner. We had the World Series, and you let the grounder go through your legs. Let someone else have the chance.&quot; In August 2019, Maher said an economic recession would be &quot;worth it&quot; if Donald Trump did not get re-elected in 2020. He said: &quot;We have survived many recessions. We can&#x27;t survive another Donald Trump term.&quot;

Over the course of 20 different editions of &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot; broadcast between April 13, 2018, and August 7, 2020, and in several press interviews, Maher predicted that Trump would refuse to concede any loss in the 2020 United States presidential election, dedicating a &#x27;New Rules&#x27; end segment to the subject on January 25, 2020. Maher highlighted Trump&#x27;s own public references to Maher&#x27;s assertions that Trump was &quot;not going to leave&quot;, and quoted Trump&#x27;s March 14, 2019, assertion, &quot;I have the support of the police, the military, the bikers [for Trump]&quot; and &quot;the tough people&quot;, citing this as evidence that Trump would seek to remain in office by force. Maher predicted there would be violence by armed Trump supporters attempting to keep Trump in power and criticized Democratic Party politicians for not taking the threat seriously:&quot;So my question to all Democratic candidates is: what&#x27;s the plan? If you win, and the next day he claims he&#x27;s voiding the election because of irregularities he&#x27;s hearing about, what do you do? What do you do when the crowd that was in Virginia this week, 22,000 strong, marches on Washington? This is a scary moment. And when I&#x27;ve asked Democrats, &#x27;What do we do if he doesn&#x27;t go?&#x27;, their answer is always some variation of &#x27;We have to win big!&#x27;... First of all, NO! No, we don&#x27;t have to win by a landslide! Jesus, fucking Democrats! I am so sick of Democrats volunteering to play by two different sets of rules. That&#x27;s the new paradigm? Republicans can win by one vote, but we&#x27;re not legitimate unless it&#x27;s a landslide? Fuck. And two, do you really think it would matter if it was? That they would suddenly get rational about math and facts? They believe Hillary ran a pedophile ring out of a pizza parlor!&quot;Maher later said in an August 15, 2020, interview with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; that &quot;we&#x27;ve baked it into the cake that he&#x27;s not going to leave.&quot; In the September 25, 2020, edition of &quot;Real Time&quot;, Maher criticized the framing of a &quot;New York Times&quot; story by Michael Crowley headlined &quot;Trump Won&#x27;t Commit to Peaceful Transfer of Power&quot;, which ran on page 15 of the print edition of the paper. Maher asserted, &quot;I got no help from the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;Washington Post&quot;, [or] CNN&quot;, adding that the media &quot;should have amplified&quot; the severity of Trump&#x27;s threats that he would refuse to concede or commit to a peaceful transition of power.

In January 2022, Maher declined to run in the 2024 United States presidential election following speculation by Dana Perino that he might be called on to do so. In July 2024, he called on Joe Biden to decline the Democratic party&#x27;s nomination in order to have an open convention at the Democratic Convention; Maher expressed his support for Gavin Newsom to replace Biden as the party&#x27;s nominee.

=== National security ===
On June 7, 2013, Maher expressed on his show limited support for the NSA&#x27;s PRISM intelligence data collection from private phone calls and the Internet, saying that the threat of terrorists obtaining and using nuclear weapons was the tipping point for him. While he stated that he trusted the Obama administration to employ the program responsibly, he described the NSA&#x27;s access to private data as a &quot;slippery slope&quot;, and worried about whether other politicians would be as responsible.

Since the 9/11 attacks, he has endorsed certain uses of profiling at airports, saying, &quot;Places like Israel, where they have faced terrorism for a long time, of course understand that profiling is part of all detective work. It&#x27;s part of all police work. If they stop calling it profiling and start calling it high-intelligence screening or something, people would go, it&#x27;s about time.&quot;

Maher opposed Trump&#x27;s Executive Order 13769, which banned entry into the US of citizens from five majority-Muslim countries, and has hosted multiple guests, including Sam Harris and Jim Jefferies, on his show who have also opposed the order. In 2022, Maher criticized the Biden administration&#x27;s Disinformation Governance Board and agreed with the comparison that the board was similar to the Ministry of Truth from George Orwell&#x27;s dystopian novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

=== Foreign policy ===
Maher favors having a strong military, but has said he is disenchanted with the size of the American military and defense spending. In 2015, Maher criticized Barack Obama&#x27;s visit to Saudi Arabia, a close U.S. ally, saying: &quot;Stop respecting their medieval bullshit under the guise of, &#x27;It&#x27;s their culture. Maher opposed the Iraq War from the beginning and has summarised his opinion by saying that the United States and the world have had to pay too high a price for the war.

On the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Maher says he is &quot;more on the side of the Israelis&quot; and does not consider both sides equally guilty. He acknowledges that &quot;Palestinians do have gripes&quot;, and he has been critical of U.S. financial aid to Israel, saying &quot;they don&#x27;t need our money, they can handle it themselves.&quot; Maher claims that most Israelis prefer a two-state solution and oppose the hard-line stance of their government, which he describes as having been taken over by their version of the Tea Party. However, Maher has defended Israel&#x27;s military actions against Palestinians amid criticism over civilian deaths and disproportionate casualty count between Israelis and Palestinians during the 2014 Gaza war. He argues that Israel is still showing restraint, and he finds it ironic that the same people who were incredulous over how the Jews in World War II were led &quot;to their slaughter&quot; cannot understand why they are defending themselves now. Maher faced online backlash for tweeting at the start of the war, &quot;Dealing w/ Hamas is like dealing w/ a crazy woman who&#x27;s trying to kill u - u can only hold her wrists so long before you have to slap her&quot;.

In August 2019, Maher denounced the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s predicated on this notion ... I think it&#x27;s very shallow thinking that the Jews in Israel are mostly white and Palestinians are mostly brown, so they must be innocent and correct and the Jews must be wrong.&quot; He responded to Rep. Rashida Tlaib&#x27;s call to boycott his talk show: &quot;Some people have one move only: boycott. Cancel. Make-go-away. But here&#x27;s the thing, the house voted 318 to 17 to condemn the #BDS movement, including 93% of Dems. Does Tlaib want to boycott 93% of her own party?&quot;. Condemning the October 7 attacks by Hamas militants on Israel, Maher spoke about it as Israel&#x27;s 9/11, and took serious issue with people who seemed to applaud these attacks; however, he cautioned Israel not to &quot;lose the moral high ground&quot; in the 2023 Israel-Hamas war. Maher expressed disappointment with former President Barack Obama over his comments on the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, saying that &quot;there is a big difference between collateral damage and what Hamas did.&quot;

In April 2020, Maher criticized those who equated using the term &quot;Wuhan virus&quot; with racism, stating, &quot;Scientists...have been naming diseases after the places they came from for a very long time. Zika is from the Zika Forest, Ebola from the Ebola River, hantavirus the Hantan River. There&#x27;s the West Nile virus and Guinea worm and Rocky Mountain spotted fever and, of course, the Spanish flu.&quot; He added: &quot;This has nothing to do with Asian Americans, and it has everything to do with China.&quot; In March 2021, Maher criticized China&#x27;s treatment of Uyghur minority in Xinjiang. He said the United States has &quot;lost&quot; to China in the &quot;battle for the 21st century.&quot; According to Maher, China is dominating the world while the United States is wasting time in a &quot;never-ending woke competition.&quot;

=== Race ===
In June 2017, Maher came under criticism for saying in an off-the-cuff joke &quot;I&#x27;m a house nigger&quot; in response to guest Senator Ben Sasse offering Maher to work on the fields in his home state on &quot;Real Time&quot;. This led to calls being made by people to HBO to fire him. Following the episode, HBO sent a statement to media outlets, calling Maher&#x27;s remarks &quot;inexcusable and tasteless&quot;, and said the cable network would remove that segment from future airings of the show. Maher also issued a statement apologizing for the remarks, saying in part, &quot;I regret the word I used in the banter of a live moment. The word was offensive, and I regret saying it and am very sorry&quot;. Maher apologized on his show and had a discussion with Michael Eric Dyson, Ice Cube, and Symone Sanders about the controversy.

In 2021, Maher opposed the NFL&#x27;s decision to play the &quot;Black national anthem&quot; before games, considering it a form of segregation. Instead, he argued for one national anthem and rejected separate ceremonies and dorms based on race, which drew some criticism. In 2022, Maher criticized the Democratic Party for &quot;checking boxes&quot; in regard to candidates of different identity groups, including race. He stated that Democrats prioritize diversity over merit. Maher has also spoken out against critical race theory but supports teaching the history of racism.

=== Immigration ===
In November 2015, Maher expressed opposition to the United States accepting Syrian refugees. Maher argued that they have different values which are at odds with American values due to some refugees may be coming from places which are governed by Sharia law or want to be. Maher cited cases in the UK where Muslim immigrants had carried out female genital mutilation and honor killings. In 2021, after the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, Maher urged America to take in Afghan refugees. Maher has criticized Donald Trump&#x27;s opposition to immigration, including his proposed border wall, and accused him of hypocrisy, having himself married two immigrants. Maher has also accused Republicans of hypocrisy for opposing immigration and praising their immigrant parents, saying &quot;You can&#x27;t spend the first half of a debate bitching about how immigrants are ruining the country and the second half on the uplifting stories of your immigrant parents.&quot; Maher has criticized Democrats&#x27; approach to immigration and has praised Canada&#x27;s system, saying &quot;Canada is much more to the right on immigration. You have to have a skill. That&#x27;s mostly what it&#x27;s based on. Ours is mostly based on family.&quot;

=== Gun rights and hunting rights ===
Maher endorsed a 2014 Maine referendum to ban the use of bait, traps and dogs to hunt bears in Maine. He specifically criticized the use of bait, referring to its use as &quot;nothing but an execution&quot;. Maher is a gun owner, and explained in his February 12, 2013, appearance on the late-night TV talk show &quot;Conan&quot; that he owns guns for personal home protection. However, he does not identify himself as a &quot;proud&quot; gun owner, commenting that being a proud gun owner is akin to &quot;saying I&#x27;m a &#x27;proud remote control owner. Maher has stated that statistics showing that gun owners are more likely to harm a member of their household are caused by irresponsible gun owners, and believes that tragedies such as school shootings will not lead to a fundamental change in gun laws because both Democrats and Republicans favor guns. Maher has also questioned the need to own large arsenals of guns. He believes the Second Amendment is &quot;bullshit&quot; and said that bipartisan background check legislation proposed by Pat Toomey and Joe Manchin was &quot;so marginal&quot;. In 2022, Maher blamed mass shooting in part due to Hollywood romanticization of gun violence in movies. However Maher has said that despite him not liking guns he is glad that they exist saying it &quot;levels the playing field&quot;.

==Socio-religious views==
===Religion===
Maher is highly critical of religion and views it as highly destructive. He has been described, or self-identified, variously as an agnostic, atheist, and apatheist, while objecting to having his views defined by a single label. In his 2008 feature film &quot;Religulous&quot;, he refers to himself as agnostic. He has rejected being grouped with explicit atheists, saying in 2002, &quot;I&#x27;m not an atheist. There&#x27;s a really big difference between an atheist and someone who just doesn&#x27;t believe in religion. Religion to me is a bureaucracy between man and God that I don&#x27;t need, but I&#x27;m not an atheist, no.&quot;

Maher has occasionally referred to himself as an apatheist, saying in 2011 &quot;I don&#x27;t know what happens when you die, and I don&#x27;t care.&quot; When discussing his apatheism and his views on the existence of God, he said on a scale from 1 to 7 (7 being &quot;absolutely certain there is no god&quot;), he was only at 6.9, like Richard Dawkins, &quot;because we just don&#x27;t know ... but we just don&#x27;t think about it.&quot; He added, &quot;There&#x27;s atheist and there&#x27;s agnostic, and I&#x27;m okay with us not splitting the difference on those; if you are just not a super-religious person, you are on my team.&quot; Several months later on a 2012 episode of his HBO show, Maher declared that &quot;idiots must stop claiming that atheism is a religion ... believe it or not, I don&#x27;t really enjoy talking about religion all the time. In fact, not only is atheism not a religion, it&#x27;s not even my hobby, and that&#x27;s the best thing about being an atheist. It requires so little of your time.&quot; He has reiterated his stance during other interviews, rejecting both the certitude of the existence, as well as the certitude of nonexistence of deities, concluding, &quot;I&#x27;m saying that doubt is the only appropriate response for human beings.&quot;

While critical of all organized religions, saying &quot;they&#x27;re all stupid and dangerous&quot;, Maher says all religions are not alike, and has drawn comparisons and contrasts between them. He has said, &quot;By any standard, Mormonism is more ridiculous than any other religion.&quot; He has referred to tenets of Judaism as &quot;insane&quot; and &quot;funny&quot;, and has said that Buddhism includes some crazy things like &quot;reincarnation&quot;. He has described Christianity and Islam as more &quot;warlike&quot;, and has asserted that, like historic Christianity, present-day Islam needs to undergo its own reformation and enlightenment.

In defense of his criticism of Islam, Sharia law and Muslim culture, Maher says he &quot;believes in the values that Western people believe in which a lot of the Muslim world does not. Like separation of church and state. Like equality of the sexes. Like respect for minorities, free elections, free speech, freedom to gather. These things are not just different from cultures that don&#x27;t have them... It&#x27;s better ... I would like to keep those values here.&quot; In 2017, Maher agreed with the author Sam Harris that &quot;the left has allied itself with Islamists&quot;, and that the liberals had failed to stand up to Islamic extremism.

Citing studies and poll results by Pew Research Center, the World Economic Forum and others, Maher says the human rights violations and &quot;illiberal ideas&quot; found in Islam are not extremist views held by a small minority but are supported by a majority of citizens in Muslim countries. Maher has criticized liberals as hypocritical for defending these core liberal values and ideals only at home, while not condemning the oppression of these values and groups in Muslim culture. Regarding the more recent publicity generated by his stance in the ongoing debate, Maher says he thinks people are finally paying closer attention to a conversation that they need to have. &quot;I&#x27;m just shining a light on the reality of the situation. I don&#x27;t even understand why this is so controversial.&quot;

Maher received the 2009 Richard Dawkins Award from Atheist Alliance International. He was an advisory board member of author Sam Harris&#x27;s Project Reason, a foundation that promotes scientific knowledge and secular values within society. In 2023, while still being critical of religion, Maher discussed some of his spiritual queries and interests with long-time friend and new age guru, Deepak Chopra.

===Health care===
Maher supports the establishment of a Medicare-for-All universal single-payer health care system, and has consistently agreed with the proposal since 2011. Maher has stated that the American Medical Association is a powerful lobbying group and was one of the primary reasons why the United States had failed to enact health care reform in the decades prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act. On the topic of getting the Affordable Care Act passed, in 2009 Maher stated that Obama should forget about trying to get 60 votes for it because &quot;he only needs 51&quot;: &quot;Forget getting the sixty votes or sixty percent—sixty percent of people don&#x27;t believe in evolution in this country—he just needs to drag them to it, like I said, they&#x27;re stupid; get health care done, with or without them.&quot; On Fox News in a televised debate with Bill O&#x27;Reilly, Maher said that &quot;if Jesus was in charge of the country we&#x27;d probably have health care for everybody.&quot;

Maher has expressed the view that a lot of illness was the result of poor diet and lack of exercise, and that medicine was often not the most appropriate way of addressing illness. In an episode of his show about the 2008 presidential candidates&#x27; health plans, Maher stated that poor nutrition was a primary cause of illness, and that &quot;the answer isn&#x27;t another pill.&quot; He also has said: &quot;If you believe you need to take all the pills the pharmaceutical industry says you do, then you&#x27;re already on drugs!&quot; He has expressed his distaste for the pharmaceutical and health care industries in general, arguing that they made their money out of treating people who are made sick by consuming unhealthy food that corporations push on the public. Maher maintains that mass consumption of high-fructose corn syrup is a contributor to the rise in frequency of obesity in the United States.

In a discussion with Michael Moore about the film &quot;Sicko&quot;, Maher said, &quot;The human body is pretty amazing; it doesn&#x27;t get sick, usually, for no reason. I mean, there&#x27;s some genetic stuff that can get to you, but, basically, people are sick in this country because they&#x27;re poisoned. The environment is a poisoning factor, but also, we gotta say, they poison themselves. They eat shit. People eat shit, and that&#x27;s, to my way of thinking, about 90 percent of why people are sick, is because they eat shit.&quot; Tara Parker-Pope and former Senator (R-TN) Bill Frist, a physician, have called Maher&#x27;s criticism of the H1N1 flu vaccinations unscientific. Infectious diseases expert Paul Offit wrote that misinformation about vaccines from celebrities like Maher has put children at unnecessary risk.

Surgical Oncologist David Gorski criticized Maher&#x27;s claims about vaccines several times on ScienceBlogs, and deemed it inappropriate that Maher received the Richard Dawkins Award. Skeptics, including magician and popular science writer Martin Gardner, neurologist Steven Novella, and magician Jamy Ian Swiss have also strongly rebuked Maher, characterizing him as anti-science, uninformed and potentially endangering the health of fans who take his &quot;non-medical&quot; advice. Maher responded to the criticism, saying, &quot;What I&#x27;ve read about what they think I&#x27;m saying is not what I&#x27;ve said. I&#x27;m not a germ theory denier. I believe vaccinations can work. Polio is a good example. Do I think in certain situations that inoculating Third World children against malaria or diphtheria, or whatever, is right? Of course. In a situation like that, the benefits outweigh costs. But to me living in Los Angeles? To get a flu shot? No.&quot; In 2019, Gorski again criticized Maher for his HBO interview with the doctor Jay Gordon and Maher&#x27;s claims about vaccines (in particular, the influenza vaccine), including the speculation about a link between vaccines and autism, which is debunked according to consensus science. In January 2021, Maher promoted the COVID-19 lab leak theory. On April 16, 2021, Maher called media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic &quot;panic porn&quot; and added that &quot;When all of our sources for medical information have an agenda to spin us, yeah, you wind up with a badly misinformed population, including on the left.&quot;

===Cannabis legalization===
Maher, who has a California medical marijuana card, openly and publicly uses cannabis, and has been a visible supporter of cannabis law reform. Maher is a member of the advisory boards for both the NORML and Marijuana Policy Project, organizations that support regulated legalization of cannabis. He sold cannabis while in college at Cornell and credits it for making his college and the beginning of his career as a comic possible. In 2015, Maher called on then President Barack Obama to pardon people incarcerated for marijuana offenses and later praised President Joe Biden for pardoning citizens convicted of marijuana offenses. He has been called &quot;one of the brightest torches for sensible marijuana policy&quot; and &quot;a contemporary cannabis statesman&quot;.

=== Conspiracy theories ===
Maher has been a critic of 9/11 conspiracy theories. On October 19, 2007, Maher confronted several 9/11 truthers and had them ejected from his show audience after they interrupted the live show numerous times by calling out from the audience. The incident drew significant media attention and praise from Fox News talk show host and frequent critic John Gibson. Maher has spoken out against QAnon and the conspiracy theories they have promoted. Maher has criticized the decision to ban conspiracy theorist Alex Jones from Twitter saying &quot;I don&#x27;t like Alex Jones, but Alex Jones gets to speak. Everybody gets to speak.&quot;&quot;&quot;

=== Gender and sexuality ===
Maher has been critical of the #MeToo movement, describing it in February 2018 as McCarthyism. He has supported Chris Matthews against allegations of sexual harassment in 2020. He has also downplayed the sexual harassment allegations against former senator Al Franken including rejecting the idea that Franken was a &quot;sexual predator&quot; and has suggested that the allegations against Franken were political.

Maher supports same-sex marriage. He has referred to arguments against same-sex marriage as &quot;bankrupt&quot;. In May 2022, on why more people are identifying as LGBT, Maher said &quot;Yes, part of the rise in LGBT numbers is from people feeling free enough to tell it to a pollster, and that&#x27;s all good, but some of it is [because] it&#x27;s trendy&quot;. Maher also referred to puberty blockers and other transgender health care for trans youth as &quot;literally experimenting on children&quot;. GLAAD criticized Maher for these statements and referred to him as transphobic, citing articles from organizations such as the World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics that state gender-affirming care is medically appropriate.

Maher has also criticized the Democratic Party&#x27;s approach to sex education on multiple occasions. In March 2022, Maher rebuked liberals for their opposition to the Florida Parental Rights in Education Act and defended Republicans for pushing the bill.

=== 2023 Writers Guild of America strike ===
Maher criticized the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike on his &quot;Club Random&quot; podcast. Speaking to comedian Jim Gaffigan in September 2023, has stated, &quot;they kind of believe that you&#x27;re owed a living as a writer, and you&#x27;re not&quot;. He went on to say that &quot;They&#x27;re asking for a lot of things that are, like, kooky.&quot; In an interview with TMZ, Maher stated he supported the strike and added that the writers have &quot;legitimate gripes&quot; with the studios. However, Maher clarified his problems with the strike noting &quot;there are some things that [the writers] are demanding I don&#x27;t agree with.&quot; In particular, Maher criticized the WGA proposal of having a mandate to have a particular set number of writers on each show. He stated, &quot;They want to micromanage the creative process in a way that I think is antithetical to anybody that is an artist. They want to tell people how many people, what kind of people you can have working on your show, writing on your show&quot;. Maher stated his wish to have Governor Gavin Newsom help end the strike.

On September 13, 2023, Maher released a statement on Twitter announcing his plans to restart a version of his HBO show. He wrote in part:
Maher&#x27;s announcement, as well as the continuation of &quot;The Drew Barrymore Show&quot; and &quot;The View&quot;, led to protests. The Writers Guild of America released a statement describing Maher&#x27;s decision as &quot;disappointing&quot;, adding, &quot;It is difficult to imagine how &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot; can go forward without a violation of WGA strike rules taking place. WGA will be picketing this show.&quot; Early the next week, Maher said he would wait a few days to see what the next round of negotiations might produce.

==Awards and nominations==
Maher has received 41 Primetime Emmy Award nominations winning for Outstanding Informational Series or Special for &quot;Vice&quot; in 2015. He also received two Grammy Award nominations and various Producers Guild of America Award and Writers Guild of America Award nominations. In 2003 he was nominated at the 57th Tony Awards for the Tony Award for Best Special Theatrical Event for &quot;Bill Maher: Victory Begins at Home&quot;. In 2016 &quot;Vice&quot; was nominated for the Peabody Award their segment on Student debt. Maher was honored by &quot;High Times&quot; as &quot;Top Pot Comic in 2006&quot; and &quot;Real Time&quot; won a Stony Award in 2006 for &quot;Best Cable News Show&quot;. &quot;High Times&quot; later designated him as &quot;Stoner of the Year&quot;.

==Personal life==
Maher has never married. Regarding marriage, Maher is quoted on his website as saying, &quot;I&#x27;m the last of my guy friends to have never gotten married, and their wives—they don&#x27;t want them playing with me. I&#x27;m like the escaped slave—I bring news of freedom.&quot; Maher has said his influences include Lenny Bruce, Woody Allen, Steve Allen, Johnny Carson, Robert Klein, and George Carlin. Comedians who have said they were influenced by Maher include Chris Rock.

In 2003, he began dating flight attendant Coco Johnsen. In November 2004, at the end of their 17-month relationship, Johnsen sued Maher for US$9 million for &quot;pain and suffering&quot; for alleged &quot;insulting, humiliating and degrading racial comments.&quot; Her suit stated that Maher promised to marry her and father her children, support her financially and buy a house in Beverly Hills. Johnsen&#x27;s suit also alleged that she quit her job as a flight attendant and occasional model to be with him. Maher&#x27;s lawyers in their response, filed on November 23, 2004, in Los Angeles County Superior Court said Maher is a &quot;confirmed bachelor, and a very public one at that&quot; who &quot;never promised to marry [Johnsen] or to have children with her.&quot; Maher&#x27;s filing stated that, after the relationship had ended, Johnsen &quot;launched a campaign to embarrass, humiliate, and extort ridiculous sums of money from Bill Maher.&quot; Johnsen&#x27;s lawsuit was dismissed on May 2, 2005.

In 2005, Maher began dating Karrine Steffans, author and former hip hop model. When commentators suggested there was a pattern to his dating because both his girlfriend and former girlfriend were black, Maher said, &quot;People say I&#x27;m into black women. Robert De Niro is into black women. I&#x27;m just into women who are real, and they happen to be black.&quot; From 2009 to 2011, Maher dated former adjunct professor, science educator, and current &quot;Skeptics&#x27; Guide to the Universe&quot; co-host Cara Santa Maria. Since 2014, Maher has dated Canadian singer Anjulie Persaud. In 2012, Maher purchased a minority ownership interest in the New York Mets.

<text>Kombucha (also tea mushroom, tea fungus, or Manchurian mushroom when referring to the culture; Latin name &quot;Medusomyces gisevii&quot;) is a fermented, lightly effervescent, sweetened black tea drink. Sometimes the beverage is called kombucha tea to distinguish it from the culture of bacteria and yeast. Juice, spices, fruit, or other flavorings are often added.

Kombucha is thought to have originated in China, where the drink is traditional. By the early 20th century it spread to Russia, then other parts of Eastern Europe and Germany. Kombucha is now homebrewed globally, and also bottled and sold commercially. The global kombucha market was worth approximately billion .
Kombucha is produced by symbiotic fermentation of sugared tea using a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY) commonly called a &quot;mother&quot; or &quot;mushroom&quot;. The microbial populations in a SCOBY vary. The yeast component generally includes &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, along with other species; the bacterial component almost always includes &quot;Gluconacetobacter xylinus&quot; to oxidize yeast-produced alcohols to acetic acid (and other acids). Although the SCOBY is commonly called &quot;tea fungus&quot; or &quot;mushroom&quot;, it is actually &quot;a symbiotic growth of acetic acid bacteria and osmophilic yeast species in a zoogleal mat &quot;. The living bacteria are said to be probiotic, one of the reasons for the popularity of the drink.
Numerous health benefits have been claimed to correlate with drinking kombucha; there is little evidence to support any of these claims. The beverage has caused rare serious adverse effects, possibly arising from contamination during home preparation. It is not recommended for therapeutic purposes.

== History ==
Kombucha likely originated in the Bohai Sea region of China. It spread to Russia before reaching Europe and gained popularity in the United States in the early 21st century. With an alcohol content under 0.5%, it is not federally regulated in the U.S.

Prior to 2015, some commercially available kombucha brands were found to contain alcohol content exceeding this threshold, sparking the development of new testing methods. With rising popularity in developed countries in the early 21st century, kombucha sales increased after it was marketed as an alternative to beer and other alcoholic drinks in restaurants and pubs.

According to the market research firm Grand View Research, kombucha had a global market size of billion , and this is expected to grow to billion by 2030.

==Etymology and terminology==

The etymology of &quot;kombucha&quot; is uncertain, but it is believed to be a misapplied loanword from Japanese. English speakers may have confused the Japanese word &quot;konbucha&quot; with , popularized around 1975.

In Japanese, the term refers to a kelp tea made with &quot;konbu&quot; (an edible kelp from the family Laminariaceae) and is a completely different beverage from the fermented tea usually associated with &quot;kombucha&quot; elsewhere in the world.

&quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; suggests kombucha in English arose from misapplication of Japanese words like &quot;konbucha&quot;, &quot;kobucha&quot; &#x27;tea made from kelp&#x27;, &quot;konbu&quot;, from &quot;kobu&quot; &#x27;kelp&#x27;, + cha &#x27;tea&#x27;. &quot;The American Heritage Dictionary&quot; notes the term might have originated from the belief that the gelatinous film of kombucha resembled seaweed.

The first known use in the English language of the word to describe &quot;a gelatinous mass of symbiotic bacteria (as &quot;Acetobacter xylinum&quot;) and yeasts (as of the genera &quot;Brettanomyces&quot; and &quot;Saccharomyces&quot;) grown to produce a fermented beverage held to confer health benefits&quot; was in 1944.

==Composition and properties==

===Biological===
A kombucha culture is a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY), similar to mother of vinegar, containing one or more species each of bacteria and yeasts, which form a zoogleal mat known as a &quot;mother&quot;. There is a broad spectrum of yeast species spanning several genera reported to be present in kombucha cultures, including species of &quot;Zygosaccharomyces&quot;, &quot;Candida, Kloeckera/Hanseniaspora&quot;, &quot;Torulaspora&quot;, &quot;Pichia&quot;, &quot;Brettanomyces/Dekkera&quot;, &quot;Saccharomyces&quot;, &quot;Lachancea&quot;, &quot;Saccharomycoides&quot;, &quot;Schizosaccharomyces&quot;, &quot;Kluyveromyces, Starmera, Eremothecium, Merimbla, Sugiyamaella.&quot;

The bacterial component of kombucha comprises several species, almost always including the acetic acid bacteria &quot;Komagataeibacter xylinus&quot; (formerly &quot;Gluconacetobacter xylinus&quot;), which ferments alcohols produced by the yeasts into acetic and other acids, increasing the acidity and limiting ethanol content. The population of bacteria and yeasts found to produce acetic acid has been reported to increase for the first 4 days of fermentation, decreasing thereafter. &quot;K. xylinus&quot; produces bacterial cellulose, and is reportedly responsible for most or all of the physical structure of the &quot;mother&quot;, which may have been selectively encouraged over time for firmer (denser) and more robust cultures by brewers. The highest diversity of kombucha bacteria was found to be on the 7th day of fermentation with the diversity being less in the SCOBY. Acetobacteraceae dominate 88 percent of the bacterial community of the SCOBY. The acetic acid bacteria in kombucha are aerobic, meaning that they require oxygen for their growth and activity. Hence, the bacteria initially migrate and assemble at the air interface, followed by the excretion of bacterial cellulose after about 2 days.

The mixed, presumably mutualistic culture has been further described as being lichenous, in accord with the reported presence of the known lichenous natural product usnic acid, though as of 2015, no report appears indicating the standard cyanobacterial species of lichens in association with kombucha fungal components.

===Chemical composition===
Kombucha is made by adding the kombucha culture into a broth of sugared tea. The sugar serves as a nutrient for the SCOBY that allows for bacterial growth in the tea. Sucrose is converted, biochemically, into fructose and glucose, and these into gluconic acid and acetic acid. In addition, kombucha contains enzymes and amino acids, polyphenols, and various other organic acids which vary between preparations.

Other specific components include ethanol (see below), glucuronic acid, glycerol, lactic acid, and usnic acid (a hepatotoxin, see above).

The alcohol content of kombucha is usually less than 0.5%, but increases with extended fermentation times. The concentration of alcohol specifically ethanol increases initially but then begins to decrease when acetic acid bacteria use it to produce acetic acid. Over-fermentation generates high amounts of acids similar to vinegar. The pH of the drink is typically about 3.5.

===Nutritional content===
Kombucha tea is 95% water and contains 4% carbohydrates and several B vitamins, such as thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin B6.

== Production ==

Kombucha can be prepared at home or commercially. It is made by dissolving sugar in non-chlorinated boiling water. Tea leaves are then steeped in the hot sugar water and discarded. The sweetened tea is cooled and the SCOBY culture is added. The mixture is then poured into a sterilized beaker along with previously fermented kombucha tea to lower the pH. This technique is known as &quot;backslopping&quot;. The container is covered with a paper towel or breathable fabric to prevent insects, such as fruit flies, from contaminating the kombucha.

The tea is left to ferment for a period of up to 10 to 14 days at room temperature (18 °C to 26 °C). A new &quot;daughter&quot; SCOBY will form on the surface of the tea to the diameter of the container. After fermentation is completed, the SCOBY is removed and stored along with a small amount of the newly fermented tea. The remaining kombucha is strained and bottled for a secondary ferment for a few days or stored at a temperature of 4 °C.
Commercially bottled kombucha became available in the late 1990s. In 2010, elevated alcohol levels were found in many bottled kombucha products, leading retailers including Whole Foods to pull the drinks from store shelves temporarily. In response, kombucha suppliers reformulated their products to have lower alcohol levels.

By 2014, US sales of bottled kombucha were $400 million, $350 million of which was by Millennium Products, Inc. which sells GT&#x27;s Kombucha. In 2014, several companies that make and sell kombucha formed a trade organization, Kombucha Brewers International. In 2016, PepsiCo purchased kombucha maker KeVita for approximately $200 million. In the US, sales of kombucha and other fermented drinks rose by 37 percent in 2017. Beer companies like Full Sail Brewing Company and Molson Coors Beverage Company produce kombucha by themselves or via subsidiaries.

As of 2021, the drink had some popularity in India&#x27;s National Capital Region, partly due to its success in the west.

=== Hard kombucha ===
Some commercial kombucha producers sell what they call &quot;hard kombucha&quot; with an alcohol content of over 5 percent.

== Health claims ==

Kombucha is promoted with many claims for health benefits, from alleviating hemorrhoids to combating cancer. Although people may drink kombucha for such supposed health effects (attributed first to the protective impact of tea itself, and to fermentation products including glucuronic acid, acetic acid, polyphenols, phenols, and B-complex vitamins such as folic acid ), there is no clinical proof that it provides any benefit. In a 2003 review, physician Edzard Ernst characterized kombucha as an &quot;extreme example&quot; of an unconventional remedy because of the disparity between implausible, wide-ranging health claims and the potential risks of the product. It concluded that the proposed, unsubstantiated therapeutic claims did not outweigh known risks, and that kombucha should not be recommended for therapeutic use, being in a class of &quot;remedies that only seem to benefit those who sell them&quot;.

===Adverse effects===
Reports of adverse effects related to kombucha consumption are rare, but may be underreported, according to a 2003 review. The American Cancer Society said in 2009 that &quot;serious side effects and occasional deaths have been associated with drinking Kombucha tea.&quot; Because kombucha is a commonly homemade fermentation, caution should be taken because pathogenic microorganisms can contaminate the tea during preparation.

Adverse effects associated with kombucha consumption may include severe hepatic (liver) and renal (kidney) toxicity as well as metabolic acidosis.

Some adverse health effects may arise from the acidity of the tea causing acidosis, and brewers are cautioned to avoid over-fermentation. Other adverse effects may be a result of bacterial or fungal contamination during the brewing process. Some studies have found the hepatotoxin usnic acid in kombucha, although it is not known whether the cases of liver damage are due to usnic acid or to some other toxin.

Drinking kombucha can be harmful for people with preexisting ailments. Due to its microbial sourcing and possible non-sterile packaging, kombucha is not recommended for people with poor immune function, women who are pregnant or nursing, or children under 4 years old: It may compromise immune responses or stomach acidity in these susceptible populations. There are certain drugs that one should not take with kombucha because of the small percentage of alcohol content.

A 2019 review enumerated numerous potential health risks (including hyponatremia, lactic acidosis, toxic hepatitis, etc.), but said &quot;kombucha is not considered harmful if about 4 oz [120 mL] per day is consumed by healthy individuals; potential risks are associated with a low pH brew leaching heavy metals from containers, excessive consumption of highly acidic kombucha, or consumption by individuals with pre-existing health conditions.&quot;

===Caffeine===
Kombucha contains a small amount of caffeine.

== Other uses ==
Kombucha culture, when dried, becomes a leather-like textile known as a microbial cellulose that can be molded onto forms to create seamless clothing. Using different broth media such as coffee, black tea, and green tea to grow the kombucha culture results in different textile colors, although the textile can also be dyed using other plant-based dyes. Different growth media and dyes also change the textile&#x27;s feel and texture. Additionally, the SCOBY itself can be dried and eaten as a sweet or savory snack.

<doc id="264064" wikidata="Q1482551" url="?curid=264064" title="Het Parool">
<text>Het Parool () is an Amsterdam-based daily newspaper. It was first published on 10 February 1941 as a resistance paper during the German occupation of the Netherlands (1940–1945). In English, its name means &quot;The Password&quot; or &quot;The Motto&quot;.

== History ==
=== Second World War ===
The paper was preceded by a stenciled newsletter which was started in May 1940 by Frans Goedhart. In late 1940, Wim van Norden joined the group of producers of the newsletter; Van Norden would later serve as director of the newspaper between 1945 and 1979. Jaap Nunes Vaz also became involved with the newspaper. In 1944, the paper, albeit illegal and vigorously persecuted, reached a circulation of approximately 100,000, and it was distributed by the Dutch resistance. Other important contributors were Simon Carmiggelt and Max Nord, who lived with Van Norden and their families on the Reguliersgracht, in the headquarters of the paper, which was never discovered by the German occupiers.

Numerous staff were apprehended and killed by the Germans and their Dutch collaborators. Alphons Meeuwis who distributed the paper was arrested in 1941 and sent to various camps. Nunes Vaz was arrested by the Gestapo on 25 October 1942 and sent to Sobibor concentration camp.

=== Postwar ===
After the war, &quot;Het Parool&quot; quickly became one of the largest newspapers in the Netherlands, partly because much of the population appreciated it for being the most prolific resistance paper and partly because newspapers that had collaborated with the German occupier were banned from publication.

Apart from its main publication, &quot;Het Parool&quot; published magazines and local newspapers in the Netherlands. A string of locally-based newspapers appeared alongside &quot;Het Parool&quot;, including &quot;Het Rotterdamsch Parool&quot; (1947–1971), &quot;Nieuw Utrechtsch Dagblad&quot;, &quot;Haagsch Dagblad&quot;, and &quot;Het Flevoparool&quot; (1982–1988). These local publications were all discontinued in the late sixties, early seventies, or (in the case of &quot;Het Flevoparool&quot;) eighties.

Readership reached its peak in the mid-1960s with a subscription of over 400,000, making it the second-biggest newspaper in the Netherlands at that time. In the latter part of the 1960s, the newspaper, under conservative editor in chief Herman Sandberg, vehemently supported the Vietnam War, which alienated a substantial part of &quot;Het Parool&quot;&#x27;s majority liberal and left-wing readership. This started a steady decline in subscriptions and circulation, which persisted for almost four decades.

=== Perscombinatie and PCM ===
In 1968 &quot;Het Parool&quot; started the publishing company Perscombinatie (&quot;English&quot;: Press Combination) with competitor &quot;De Volkskrant&quot;, mainly to join investment in new printing presses. In 1973 &quot;Trouw&quot;, also a former resistance paper, joined the corporation.

At the start of Perscombinatie, &quot;Het Parool&quot; was the leading paper, but due to its declining circulation, &quot;De Volkskrant&quot; took over the prime role within the company starting in the early eighties, although the owner of the &quot;Het Parool&quot;, Stichting Het Parool (&quot;English&quot;: The Parool Foundation) remained the majority shareholder, with 57 % of the shares of Perscombinatie. After Stichting Het Parool merged with book publisher Meulenhoff, the two formed Perscombinatie and Meulenhoff &amp; Company (PCM).

=== Termination and restart ===
In the 1990s, &quot;Het Parool&quot; started turning a loss, due to stiff competition and a lack of investment by PCM. The paper tried several different programs to counter this (including a move toward being a local Amsterdam newspaper in 1997), but these showed few results. In 2002, PCM announced termination of the paper, citing substantial losses and declining readership.

But instead, majority shareholder Stichting Het Parool opted for a management bailout of the newspaper, in effect terminating its ownership of PCM in return for the rights to publish &quot;Het Parool&quot;. The bailout took effect on 1 January 2003. PCM was subsequently acquired by British-based investment group Apax Partners, which led to substantial debts and significant problems for the company.

=== De Persgroep and DPG Media ===
To strengthen this new ownership base, De Persgroep, the biggest newspaper publisher in Belgium, was asked to take a substantial minority share in the setup, alongside minority participation by both staff and readers. As a stand-alone newspaper, &quot;Het Parool&quot; remained national, yet with a focus on its Amsterdam home base.

In the new configuration, and after a collective layoff of 43 staff, &quot;Het Parool&quot; returned to profit within a year. On 30 March 2003 &quot;Het Parool&quot; became the first newspaper in the Netherlands to switch from broadsheet to tabloid format. 

For Belgium-based De Persgroep, &quot;Het Parool&quot; served as a first foothold in the Netherlands, leading to the acquisition of a majority of the struggling PCM in 2009. In 2011, &quot;Het Parool&quot; was re-absorbed by PCM, which was renamed De Persgroep Nederland. Former Stichting Het Parool management began to run the company, closely re-establishing the Perscombinatie-situation of the 1970s.

In February 2012, &quot;Het Parool&quot; acquired Amsterdam-based commercial television station AT5 with public broadcaster AVRO and regional TV station RTV Noord-Holland to form a new multimedia corporation, which will also include online activities of both Parool and AT5, within De Persgroep.

== Organization and subscription ==
 &quot;Het Parool&quot; had a staff of 73, who are based at the City desk, Arts and Media, Sports, Foreign, and Business desks. The paper consists of a news section and a daily, themed magazine called &quot;PS&quot;. On weekends, a glossy, &quot;PS van de Week&quot;, is published alongside the newspaper. The current editor in chief is Kamilla Leupen. 

Its daily circulation, through subscription, was 64,403 in 2013.

== Layout and typeface ==
&quot;Het Parool&quot; was restyled twice by Mario Garcia: in 2004 (when it became a tabloid), and in 2008.

<text>William Joseph Norton (2 November 1900 – 4 December 1963) was an Irish Labour Party politician who served as Tánaiste from 1948 to 1951 and from 1954 to 1957, Leader of the Labour Party from 1932 to 1960, Minister for Social Welfare from 1948 to 1951 and Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1954 to 1957. He was a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1926 to 1927 and from 1932 to 1961.

Norton was born in Dublin in 1900. He joined the postal service in 1916. By 1920, he was a prominent member of the Irish Postal Union and the wider trade union movement in Ireland. From 1924 to 1957, he served as Secretary of the Post Office Workers&#x27; Union.
He was elected as a Labour Party TD for Dublin County at a by-election in 1926, but was defeated at the June 1927 general election. On constitutional matters, Norton opposed the introduction into force of the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936 which continued a role for the British King after the King was removed from the Constitution of Ireland. In Norton’s view, the association with the British King should have ended when Edward VIII “voluntarily relinquished his objectionable role here”.

In Professor Tom Garvin&#x27;s review of the 1950s &#x27;News from a New Republic&#x27;, he comes in for praise as a moderniser. Garvin places him with a cross party group including Gerard Sweetman and Daniel Morrissey of Fine Gael as well as Seán Lemass of Fianna Fáil who were pushing a modernising agenda. He represented Kildare from 1932 until his death in 1963.

In 1932, he became leader of the Labour Party. In the First Inter-Party Government from 1948 to 1951, Norton became Tánaiste and Minister for Social Welfare. In the Second Inter-Party Government from 1954 to 1957, Norton served as Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce.

William Norton died in Dublin in 1963. His son Patrick Norton served as a TD for Kildare from 1965 to 1969.

<doc id="264070" wikidata="Q855941" url="?curid=264070" title="Restorationism">
<text>Restorationism, also known as Restitutionism or Christian primitivism, is a religious perspective according to which the early beliefs and practices of the followers of Jesus were either lost or adulterated after his death and required a &quot;restoration&quot;. It is a view that often &quot;seeks to correct faults or deficiencies, in other branches of Christianity, by appealing to the primitive church as normative model&quot;.

Efforts to restore an earlier, purer form of Christianity are frequently a response to denominationalism. As Rubel Shelly put it, &quot;the motive behind all restoration movements is to tear down the walls of separation by a return to the practice of the original, essential and universal features of the Christian religion.&quot; Different groups have tried to implement the restorationist vision in a variety of ways; for instance, some have focused on the structure and practice of the church, others on the ethical life of the church, and others on the direct experience of the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer. The relative importance given to the restoration ideal, and the extent to which the full restoration of the early church is believed to have been achieved, also varies among groups.

More narrowly, the term &quot;Restorationism&quot; is used as a descriptive term for unrelated Restorationist groups which were formed during the eras of the Great Awakenings, such as the Christadelphians (Greek: &#x27;Brothers of Christ&#x27;), Swedenborgians (i.e., The New Church), Irvingians (the largest of which is the New Apostolic Church), Latter Day Saints (i.e., Mormonism), Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses (from the tetragrammaton for God), (Spanish: &#x27;the Light of the World&#x27;), and (Tagalog: &#x27;Church of Christ&#x27;). In this sense, Restorationism has been regarded as one of the six taxonomic groupings of Christianity: the Church of the East, Oriental Orthodoxy, Eastern Orthodoxy, Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, and Restorationism. These Restorationist groups share a belief that historic Christianity lost the true faith during the Great Apostasy and that the Church needed to be restored.

The term has been used in reference to the Stone–Campbell Movement in the United States, and has been also used by more recent groups, describing their goal to re-establish Christianity in its original form, such as some anti-denominational Charismatic Restorationists, which arose in the 1970s in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.

==Uses of the term==
The terms &quot;restorationism&quot;, &quot;restorationist&quot; and &quot;restoration&quot; are used in several senses within Christianity. &quot;Restorationism&quot; in the sense of &quot;Christian primitivism&quot; refers to the attempt to correct perceived shortcomings of the current church by using the primitive church as a model to reconstruct early Christianity, and has also been described as &quot;practicing church the way it is perceived to have been done in the New Testament&quot;. 

Restorationism is called &quot;apostolic&quot; as representing the form of Christianity that the Twelve Apostles followed. These themes arise early in church history, first appearing in the works of Iranaeus, and appeared in some movements during the Middle Ages. It was expressed to varying degrees in the theology of the Protestant Reformation, and Protestantism has been described as &quot;a form of Christian restorationism, though some of its forms – for example the Churches of Christ or the Baptists – are more restorationist than others&quot;. 

A number of historical movements within Christianity may be described as &quot;restoration movements&quot;, including the Glasites in Scotland and England, the independent church led by James Haldane and Robert Haldane in Scotland, the American Restoration Movement, the Landmark Baptists and the Mormons. A variety of more contemporary movements have also been described as &quot;restorationist&quot;. Restorationism has been described as a basic component of some Pentecostal movements such as the Assemblies of God. The terms &quot;Restorationism movement&quot; and &quot;Restorationist movement&quot; have also been applied to the British New Church Movement.

Capitalized, the term is also used as a synonym for the American Restoration Movement. The term &quot;restorationism&quot; can also include the belief that the Jewish people must be restored to the promised land in fulfillment of biblical prophecy before the Second Coming of Christ. &quot;Christian restorationism&quot; is generally used to describe the 19th century movement based on this belief, though the term &quot;Christian Zionism&quot; is more commonly used to describe later forms. &quot;Restorationism&quot; is also used to describe a form of postmillennialism developed during the later half of the 20th century, which was influential among a number of charismatic groups and the British new church movement.

The term &quot;primitive&quot;, in contrast with other uses, refers to a basis in scholarship and research into the actual writings of the church fathers and other historical documents. Since written documents for the underground first-century church are sparse, the primitive church passed down its knowledge verbally. Elements of the primitive Christianity movement reject the patristic tradition of the prolific extrabiblical 2nd- and 3rd-century redaction of this knowledge (the Ante-Nicene Fathers), and instead attempt to reconstruct primitive church practices as they might have existed in the Apostolic Age. To do this, they revive practices found in the Old Testament. The term &quot;apostolic&quot; refers to a nonmainstream, often literal, apostolic succession or historical lineage tracing back to the Apostles and the Great Commission. These restorationist threads are sometimes regarded critically as being Judaizers in the Ebionite tradition.

==Historical models==
The restoration ideal has been interpreted and applied in a variety of ways. Four general historical models can be identified based on the aspect of early Christianity that the individuals and groups involved were attempting to restore. These are:
*Ecclesiastical Primitivism;
*Ethical Primitivism;
*Experiential Primitivism; and
*Gospel Primitivism.

Ecclesiastical primitivism focuses on restoring the ecclesiastical practices of the early church. Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin and the Puritans all advocated ecclesiastical primitivism. The strongest advocate of ecclesiastical primitivism in the United States was Alexander Campbell.

Ethical primitivism focuses on restoring the ethical norms and commitment to discipleship of the early church. The Anabaptists, Barton W. Stone and the Holiness Movement are examples of this form of restorationism. The movement often requires observance of universal commandments, such as a biblical Sabbath as given to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and the Hebrew calendar to define years, seasons, weeks, and days. Circumcision, animal sacrifices, and ceremonial requirements, as practiced in Judaism, are distinguished from the Ten Commandments, Noahide laws and High Sabbaths as given to, and in effect for, all humanity. The Sermon on the Mount and particularly the Expounding of the Law warn against antinomianism, the rejection of biblical teachings concerning observance of the Law.

Experiential primitivism focuses on restoring the direct communication with God and the experience of the Holy Spirit seen in the early church. Examples include the Latter Day Saint movement of Joseph Smith and Pentecostalism.

Gospel primitivism may be best seen in the theology of Martin Luther. Luther was not, in the strictest sense, a restorationist because he saw human effort to restore the church as works righteousness and was sharply critical of other Reformation leaders who were attempting to do so. On the other hand, he was convinced that the gospel message had been obscured by the Roman Catholic Church of the time. He also rejected church traditions he considered contrary to Scripture and insisted on scripture as the sole authority for the church.

These models are not mutually exclusive, but overlap; for example, the Pentecostal movement sees a clear link between ethical primitivism and experiential primitivism.

==Middle Ages==

Beginning in about 1470 a succession of Popes focused on the acquisition of money, their role in Italian politics as rulers of the papal states and power politics within the college of cardinals. Restorationism at the time was centered on movements that wanted to renew the church, such as the Lollards, the Brethren of the Common Life, the Hussites, and Girolamo Savonarola&#x27;s reforms in Florence.

While these pre-reformation movements did presage and sometimes discussed a break with Rome and papal authority, they also provoked restorationist movements within the church, such as the councils of Constance and Basle, which were held in the first half of the 15th century.

Preachers at the time regularly harangued delegates to these conferences regarding simony, venality, lack of chastity and celibacy, and the holding of multiple benefices. The lack of success of the restorationist movements led, arguably, to the Protestant Reformation.

==Protestant Reformation==

The Protestant Reformation came about through an impulse to repair the Church and return it to what the reformers saw as its original biblical structure, belief, and practice, and was motivated by a sense that &quot;the medieval church had allowed its traditions to clutter the way to God with fees and human regulations and thus to subvert the gospel of Christ.&quot; At the heart of the Reformation was an emphasis on the principle of &quot;scripture alone&quot; (sola scriptura). 

As a result, the authority of church tradition, which had taken practical precedence over scripture, was rejected. The Reformation was not a monolithic movement, but consisted of at least three identifiable sub-currents. One was centered in Germany, one was centered in Switzerland, and the third was centered in England. While these movements shared some common concerns, each had its own particular emphasis.

The Lutheran approach can be described as one of &quot;reformation,&quot; seeking &quot;to reform and purify the historic, institutional church while at the same time preserving as much of the tradition as possible.&quot; The Lutheran Churches traditionally sees themselves as the &quot;main trunk of the historical Christian Tree&quot; founded by Christ and the Apostles, holding that during the Reformation, at the Council of Trent, the Church of Rome fell away. As such, the Augsburg Confession, the Lutheran confession of faith, teaches that &quot;the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church&quot;. When the Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, they explained &quot;that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils&quot;.

In contrast, the Reformed approach can be described as one of &quot;restoration,&quot; seeking &quot;to restore the essence and form of the primitive church based on biblical precedent and example; tradition received scant respect.&quot; While Luther focused on the question &quot;How can we find forgiveness of sins?&quot;, the early Reformed theologians turned to the Bible for patterns that could be used to replace traditional forms and practices. Heinrich Bullinger and Martin Bucer in particular emphasized the restoration of biblical patterns. John Calvin reflected an intermediate position between that of Luther and Reformed theologians such as Zwingli, stressing biblical precedents for church governance, but as a tool to more effectively proclaim the gospel rather than as ends in themselves.

Luther opposed efforts to restore &quot;biblical forms and structures,&quot; because he saw human efforts to restore the church as works righteousness. He did seek the &quot;marks of the true church,&quot; but was concerned that by focusing on forms and patterns could lead to the belief that by &quot;restoring outward forms alone one has restored the essence.&quot; Thus, Luther believed that restoring the gospel was the first step in renewing the church, rather than restoring biblical forms and patterns. In this sense, Luther can be described as a gospel restorationist, even though his approach was very different from that of other restorationists.

Protestant groups have generally accepted history as having some &quot;jurisdiction&quot; in Christian faith and life; the question has been the extent of that jurisdiction. A commitment to history and primitivism are not mutually exclusive; while some groups attempt to give full jurisdiction to the primitive church, for others the apostolic &quot;first times&quot; are given only partial jurisdiction.

===Church of England and Caroline Divines===

Perhaps the most primitivist minded of the Protestant Reformation era were a group of scholars within the Church of England known as the Caroline Divines, who flourished in the 1600s during the reigns of Charles I and Charles II. They regularly appealed to the Primitive Church as the basis for their reforms. Unlike many other Christian Primitivists, the Church of the England and the Caroline Divines did not subject Scriptural interpretation to individual human reason, but rather to the hermeneutical consensus of the Church Fathers, holding to the doctrine of Prima Scriptura as opposed to Sola Scriptura. They did not hold to the separatist ecclesiology of many primitivist groups, but rather saw themselves as working within the historic established church to return it to its foundation in Scripture and the patristic tradition. Among the Caroline Divines were men like Archbishop William Laud, Bishop Jeremy Taylor, Deacon Nicholas Ferrar and the Little Gidding Community and others.

==First Great Awakening==
Methodism

Methodism began in the 1700s as a Christian Primitivist movement within the Church of England. John Wesley and his brother Charles, the founders of the movement, were high church Anglican priests in the vein of the Caroline Divines, who had a deep respect for the Primitive Church, which they generally defined as the Church before the Council Of Nicea. Unlike many other Christian Primitivists, the Wesleys and the early Methodists did not subject Scriptural interpretation to individual human reason, but rather to the hermeneutical consensus of the Ante-Nicene Fathers, holding to a view of authority more akin to Prima Scriptura rather than Sola Scriptura. 

They did not hold to the separatist ecclesiology of many primitivist groups, but rather saw themselves as working within the historic established church to return it to its foundation in Scripture and the tradition of the pre-Nicene Church. John Wesley very regularly asserted Methodism&#x27;s commitment to the Primitive Church, saying, &quot;From a child I was taught to love and reverence the Scripture, the oracles of God; and, next to these, to esteem the primitive Fathers, the writers of the first three centuries. Next after the primitive church, I esteemed our own, the Church of England, as the most Scriptural national Church in the world.&quot; 

And, &quot;Methodism, so called, is the old religion, the religion of the Bible, the religion of the primitive Church, the religion of the Church of England.&quot; On his epitaph is written, &quot;This GREAT LIGHT arose (By the Singular providence of GOD) To enlighten THESE NATIONS, And to revive, enforce, and defend, The Pure Apostolical DOCTRINES and PRACTICES of THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH…&quot;

=== Separate Baptists ===

During the First Great Awakening, a movement developed among the Baptists known as Separate Baptists. Two themes of this movement were the rejection of creeds and &quot;freedom in the Spirit.&quot; The Separate Baptists saw scripture as the &quot;perfect rule&quot; for the church. While they turned to the Bible for a structural pattern for the church, they did not insist on complete agreement on the details of that pattern. This group originated in New England, but was especially strong in the South where the emphasis on a biblical pattern for the church grew stronger. 

In the last half of the 18th century it spread to the western frontier of Kentucky and Tennessee, where the Stone and Campbell movements would later take root. The development of the Separate Baptists in the southern frontier helped prepare the ground for the Restoration Movement, as the membership of both the Stone and Campbell groups drew heavily from among the ranks of the Separate Baptists. 

Separate Baptist restorationism also contributed to the development of the Landmark Baptists in the same area at about the same time as the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement. Under the leadership of James Robinson Graves, this group looked for a precise blueprint for the primitive church, believing that any deviation from that blueprint would keep one from being part of the true church.

==Groups arising in the era of the Second Great Awakening==
The ideal of restoring a &quot;primitive&quot; form of Christianity grew in popularity in the United States after the American Revolution. This desire to restore a purer form of Christianity played a role in the development of many groups during this period, known as the Second Great Awakening, including the Mormons, Baptists and Shakers. Several factors made the restoration sentiment particularly appealing during this time period.
*To immigrants in the early 19th century, the land in America seemed pristine, edenic and undefiled - &quot;the perfect place to recover pure, uncorrupted and original Christianity&quot; - and the tradition-bound European churches seemed out of place in this new setting.
*The new American democracy seemed equally fresh and pure, a restoration of the kind of just government that God intended.
*Many believed that the new nation would usher in a new millennial age.
*Independence from the traditional churches of Europe was appealing to many Americans who were enjoying a new political independence.
*A primitive faith based on the Bible alone promised a way to sidestep the competing claims of all the many denominations available and find assurance of being right without the security of an established national church.

Camp meetings fueled the Second Great Awakening, which served as an &quot;organizing process&quot; that created &quot;a religious and educational infrastructure&quot; across the trans-Appalachian frontier that encompassed social networks, a religious journalism that provided mass communication, and church related colleges.

===American Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement===
The American Restoration Movement aimed to restore the church and sought &quot;the unification of all Christians in a single body patterned after the church of the New Testament.&quot; While the Restoration Movement developed from several independent efforts to go back to apostolic Christianity, two groups that independently developed similar approaches to the Christian faith were particularly important to its development. The first, led by Barton W. Stone began at Cane Ridge, Bourbon County, Kentucky and called themselves simply &quot;Christians&quot;. The second began in western Pennsylvania and Virginia, now West Virginia, and was led by Thomas Campbell and his son, Alexander Campbell. They used the name &quot;Disciples of Christ&quot;.
The Campbell movement was characterized by a &quot;systematic and rational reconstruction&quot; of the early church, in contrast to the Stone movement which was characterized by radical freedom and lack of dogma. Despite their differences, the two movements agreed on several critical issues. Both saw restoring apostolic Christianity as a means of hastening the millennium. Both also saw restoring the early church as a route to Christian freedom. Both believed that unity among Christians could be achieved by using apostolic Christianity as a model. 

They were united, among other things, in the belief that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; that Christians should celebrate the Lord&#x27;s Supper on the first day of each week; and that baptism of adult believers by immersion in water is a necessary condition for salvation. Because the founders wanted to abandon all denominational labels, they used the biblical names for the followers of Jesus that they found in the Bible. The commitment of both movements to restoring the early church and to uniting Christians was enough to motivate a union between many in the two movements.

With the merger, there was the challenge of what to call the new movement. Clearly, finding a biblical, non-sectarian name was important. Stone wanted to continue to use the name &quot;Christians.&quot; Alexander Campbell insisted upon &quot;Disciples of Christ&quot;. As a result, both names were used.
The Restoration Movement began during, and was greatly influenced by, the Second Great Awakening. While the Campbells resisted what they saw as the spiritual manipulation of the camp meetings, the Southern phase of the Awakening &quot;was an important matrix of Barton Stone&#x27;s reform movement&quot; and shaped the evangelistic techniques used by both Stone and the Campbells.

The Restoration Movement has seen several divisions, resulting in multiple separate groups. Three modern groups originating in the U.S. claim the Stone-Campbell movement as their roots: Churches of Christ, Christian churches and churches of Christ, and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Some see divisions in the movement as the result of the tension between the goals of restoration and ecumenism, with the churches of Christ and the Christian churches and churches of Christ resolving the tension by stressing restoration while the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) resolved the tension by stressing ecumenism. Non-U.S. churches associated with this movement include the Churches of Christ in Australia and the Evangelical Christian Church in Canada.

===Christadelphians===
John Thomas (April 12, 1805 – March 5, 1871), was a devout convert to the Restoration Movement after a shipwreck at sea on his emigration to America brought to focus his inadequate understanding of the Bible, and what would happen to him at death. This awareness caused him to devote his life to the study of the Bible and he promoted interpretations of it which were at variance with the mainstream Christian views the Restoration Movement held. In particular he questioned the nature of man. 

He held a number of debates with one of the leaders of the movement, Alexander Campbell, on these topics but eventually agreed to stop because he found the practice bestowed no further practical merits to his personal beliefs and it had the potential to create division. He later determined that salvation was dependent upon having the theology he had developed for baptism to be effective for salvation and published an &quot;Confession and Abjuration&quot; of his previous position on March 3, 1847. He was also rebaptised.

Following his abjuration and rebaptism he went to England on a preaching tour in June 1848 including Reformation Movement churches, Although his abjuration and his disfellowship in America were reported in the British churches magazines certain churches in the movement still allowed him to present his views. Thomas also gained a hearing in Unitarian and Adventist churches through his promotion of the concept of &quot;independence of thought&quot; with regards to interpreting the Bible.

Through a process of creed setting and division the Christadelphian movement emerged with a distinctive set of doctrines incorporating Adventism, anti-trinitarianism, the belief that God is a &quot;substantial and corporeal&quot; being, objection to military service, a lay-membership with full participation by all members, and other doctrines consistent with the spirit of the Restorationist movement. One consequence of objection to military service was the adoption of the name Christadelphians to distinguish this small community of believers and to be granted exemption from military service in the American Civil War.

===Swedenborgians===

The New Church was founded on the basis of the theology of Emanuel Swedenborg. As such, it is often known as the Swedenborgian Church. The New Church&#x27;s view of God is that &quot;Jesus is God incarnate, not (as certain interpretations of the traditional Christian trinity contend) an emanation of the Godhead.&quot; The New Church propounds the doctrine of Correspondence, which teaches that &quot;Every word or fact of the Bible corresponded to a spiritual truth or mystical truth.&quot; Additionally, The New Church teaches that &quot;Objects in the physical world have spiritual correspondences.&quot;

===Irvingians===
The Catholic Apostolic Church (Irvingian Church) was founded according to the theology of Edward Irving (1792–1834), who taught that &quot;God could work miracles in His Church as easily now as two thousand years ago.&quot; Belonging to the Restorationist branch of Christianity, the Irvingian Churches teach that they &quot;exercise the charismata of the Apostolic age&quot;. The church was organised in 1835 with the fourfold ministry of &quot;apostles, prophets, evangelists, and pastors.&quot; 

As a result of schism within the Catholic Apostolic Church, other Irvingian Christian denominations emerged, including the Old Apostolic Church, New Apostolic Church, Reformed Old Apostolic Church and United Apostolic Church; of these, the New Apostolic Church is the largest Irvingian Christian denomination today, with 16 million members. Irvingianism, possessing elaborate liturgies, teaches three sacraments: Baptism, Holy Communion and Holy Sealing.

===Latter Day Saint movement===

Adherents to the Latter Day Saint movement believe that founder Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, chosen to restore the primitive, apostolic church established by Jesus. Like other restorationist groups, members believe that the church and priesthood established by Jesus were withdrawn from the Earth after the end of the apostolic age and before the First Council of Nicaea in 325.

Unlike other reformers, who based their movements on their own interpretations of the Bible, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery held that they were visited by John the Baptist to receive the Aaronic Priesthood. This restoration authorized members to receive revelation from God in order to restore the original apostolic organization lost after the events of the New Testament. According to Allen and Hughes, &quot;[n]o group used the language of &#x27;restoration&#x27; more consistently and more effectively than did the [Latter Day Saints] ... early Mormons seemed obsessed with restoring the ancient church of God.&quot;

According to Smith, God appeared to him in 1820, instructing him that the creeds of the churches of the day were corrupted. In addition to restoring the primitive church, Smith claimed to receive new and ongoing revelations. In 1830, he published &quot;The Book of Mormon&quot;, with him and witnesses declaring to be a translation through divine means from the Golden Plates he obtained from an angel. 

The largest and most well known church in the Latter Day Saint movement is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), followed by Community of Christ (formerly RLDS), and dozens of other denominations. Members of the LDS Church believe that, in addition to Smith being the first prophet appointed by Jesus in the &quot;latter days&quot;, every subsequent apostle and church president also serves in the capacity of prophet, seer and revelator.

Some among the Churches of Christ have attributed the restorationist character of the Latter Day Saints movement to the influence of Sidney Rigdon, who was associated with the Campbell movement in Ohio but left it and became a close friend of Joseph Smith. Neither the Mormons nor the early Restoration Movement leaders invented the idea of &quot;restoration&quot;; it was a popular theme of the time that had developed independently of both, and Mormonism and the Restoration Movement represent different expressions of that common theme. 

The two groups had very different approaches to the restoration ideal. The Campbell movement combined it with Enlightenment rationalism, &quot;precluding emotionalism, spiritualism, or any other phenomena that could not be sustained by rational appeals to the biblical text.&quot; The Latter Day Saints combined it with &quot;the spirit of nineteenth-century Romanticism&quot; and, as a result, &quot;never sought to recover the forms and structures of the ancient church as ends in themselves&quot; but &quot;sought to restore the golden age, recorded in both Old Testament and New Testament, when God broke into human history and communed directly with humankind.&quot; Mormons gave priority to current revelation. Primitive observances of &quot;appointed times&quot; like Sabbath were secondary to continuing revelation, similarly to the progressive revelation held by some non-restorationist Christian theologians.

The &quot;Great Apostasy&quot;, or loss of the original church Jesus established, has been cited with historical evidence of changes in Christian doctrine over time, scriptures prophesying of a coming apostasy before the last days (particularly , and ) and corruption within the early churches that led to the necessity of the Protestant Reformation, which is seen as an important step towards the development of protected freedoms and speech required for a full restoration to be possible.

===Adventism===

Adventism is a Christian eschatological belief that looks for the imminent Second Coming of Jesus to inaugurate the Kingdom of God. This view involves the belief that Jesus will return to receive those who have died in Christ and those who are awaiting his return, and that they must be ready when he returns. Adventists are considered to be both restorationists and conservative Protestants.

====Millerism and Seventh-day Sabbatarianism====
The Millerites were the most well-known family of the Adventist movements. They emphasized apocalyptic teachings anticipating the end of the world, and did not look for the unity of Christendom but busied themselves in preparation for Christ&#x27;s return. Millerites sought to restore a prophetic immediacy and uncompromising biblicism that they believed had once existed but had long been rejected by mainstream Protestant and Catholic churches. From the Millerites descended the Seventh-day Adventists and the Advent Christian Church.

====Seventh-day Adventists====
The Seventh-day Adventist Church grew out of the Adventist movement, in particular the Millerites. The Seventh-day Adventist Church is the largest of several Adventist groups which arose from the Millerite movement of the 1840s in upstate New York, a phase of the Second Great Awakening. Important to the Seventh-day Adventist movement is a belief in progressive revelation, teaching that the Christian life and testimony is intended to be typified by the Spirit of Prophecy, as explained in the writings of Ellen G. White.

Much of the theology of the Seventh-day Adventist Church corresponds to Protestant Christian teachings such as the Trinity and the infallibility of Scripture. Distinctive teachings include the unconscious state of the dead and the doctrine of an investigative judgment. The church is also known for its emphasis on diet and health, its holistic understanding of the person, its promotion of religious liberty, and its conservative principles and lifestyle.

====Worldwide Church of God====
The Worldwide Church of God arose from the Seventh Day churches. The personal ministry of Herbert W. Armstrong became the Radio Church of God, which became the Worldwide Church of God. It later splintered into many other churches and groups when the Worldwide Church of God disassociated itself with the Restoration movements and made major attempts to join the Protestant branch of Christianity. The largest of these groups, the Living Church of God and the United Church of God, continue in the tradition of the Worldwide Church of God as it was under the leadership of Herbert W. Armstrong.

====Advent Christian Church====

The Advent Christian Church is unaffiliated with Seventh-day Adventism, but considers itself the second &quot;of six Christian denominations that grew out of the ministry of William Miller&quot;. As a &quot;first-day&quot; body of Adventist Christians established by &quot;The Advent Christian General Conference&quot; in 1860, the church&#x27;s beliefs include &quot;conditional immortality&quot; and a form of &quot;soul sleep&quot;.

Advent Christians such as George Storrs and Jonas Wendell influenced the Bible Student movement.

==Other groups originating in the nineteenth century==
===Bible Students===
In the 1870s, a Bible study group led by Charles Taze Russell formed into what was eventually called the Bible Student movement. Russell&#x27;s congregations did not consider him to be the founder of a new religion, but that he helped in restoring true Christianity from the apostasy that Jesus and the Apostle Paul foretold. They believed that other Churches departed in a Great Apostasy from the original faith on major points, and that the original faith could be restored through a generally literal interpretation of the Bible and a sincere commitment to follow its teachings. They focused on several key doctrinal points that they considered a return to &quot;primitive Christianity&quot;, derived from their interpretation of the Bible, including active proselytization; strict neutrality in political affairs; abstinence from warfare; a belief in the imminent manifestation of the Kingdom of God (or World to Come) on Earth, and a rejection of trinitarianism, the immortality of the soul, and the definition of Hell as a place of eternal torment.

====Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses====
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses emerged as a distinct religious organization, maintaining control of Russell&#x27;s Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society and other corporations. They continued to develop doctrines that they considered to be an improved restoration of first century Christianity, including increased emphasis on the use of &quot;Jehovah&quot; as God&#x27;s personal name.

===Plymouth Brethren===
The Plymouth Brethren is a conservative, Evangelical, restorationist movement whose origin can be traced to Dublin, Ireland, in 1827. The title, &quot;The Brethren&quot;, is one that many of their number are comfortable with, in that the Bible designates all believers as &quot;brethren&quot;. The first English assembly was in Plymouth in 1831, where the movement became well known and assemblies diffused throughout Europe and beyond. 

It was organised primarily by George Wigram, Benjamin Wills Newton and John Nelson Darby. The movement soon spread throughout the UK. By 1845, the first English assembly in Plymouth had over 1,000 souls in fellowship.

They became known as &quot;the brethren from Plymouth&quot;, and were soon simply called &quot;Plymouth Brethren&quot;. By 1848, divergence of practice and belief led to the development of two separate branches. The rift was caused primarily by a difference of opinions between John Nelson Darby and Benjamin Wills Newton in regards to eschatology. Despite more divisions, assemblies are still often generalized into two main categories: &quot;Open Brethren&quot; and &quot;Exclusive Brethren&quot;. John Duncan criticized the Brethren movement saying &quot;To end sectarianism, the Plymouth Brethren began by making a new sect, and that sect, of all sects, the most sectarian&quot;.

==20th-century and contemporary groups==

===Oneness Pentecostalism===

Pentecostalism began primarily as a restoration movement that focused on the &quot;experiential&quot; aspect of the early church. The early pioneers of the Pentecostal movement sought to restore the work and power of the Holy Spirit to the church, which they felt had been lost early on after the Apostolic Age. Oneness Pentecostals, in particular, continue to have a lot of restorationist themes present in their movement. Many Oneness Pentecostals see their movement as being a restoration of the Apostolic Church, which is why many of them refer to themselves as &quot;apostolic&quot; or to their movement as the &quot;Apostolic Pentecostal&quot; movement.

====British New Church Movement====
During the charismatic movement of the 1960s and 1970s, which focused on the transformation of the individual, some leaders formed what has become known as the Charismatic Restorationist Movement. These leaders, of whom Arthur Wallis, David Lillie and Cecil Cousen were at the forefront, focused on the nature of the church and shared a distinctive view that authentic church order was being restored to the whole church. This authentic church order centred on what is referred to as the &quot;fivefold ministries&quot;, as listed in Ephesians 4:11: Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Teachers and Pastors. 

Although the Charismatic Movement brought the Pentecostal gifts to the denominational churches, these restorationists considered denominationalism unbiblical, and shared a conviction that God would cause the church to be directly organized and empowered by the holy spirit. The movement has thousands of adherents worldwide, and notable church networks include Newfrontiers led by Terry Virgo, Salt and Light Ministries International led by Barney Coombs, and the Ichthus Christian Fellowship led by Faith and Roger Forster.

====Shepherding movement====
The British leaders of charismatic restorationism mutually recognised a parallel movement in the United States, centered on the Fort Lauderdale Five; Derek Prince, Don Basham, Bob Mumford, Charles Simpson and Ern Baxter. This movement became known as the Shepherding movement and was the subject of significant controversy in the mid-1970s. The movement left a significant legacy through its influence on contemporary ministries International Churches of Christ, Maranatha Campus Ministries and Great Commission International.

====Apostolic-Prophetic Movement====
More recently another form of charismatic restorationism with a similar recognition of the apostolic office has emerged in the form of the Apostolic-Prophetic Movement, centered on the Kansas City Prophets. Leading proponents of the movement include C. Peter Wagner, Rick Joyner, Mike Bickle and Lou Engle.

===Church of God (Restoration)===

The Church of God (Restoration) is a Christian denomination that was founded in the 1980s by Daniel (Danny) Layne. In a booklet written by Layne in the early 1980s, he claimed to be an ex-heroin addict who spent years dealing drugs and living a life of crime and sin on the streets of San Francisco. Layne was originally raised in the Church of God (Anderson), where his father was a minister. Layne began preaching in the Church of God (Guthrie, OK) after his conversion.

One tenet of this group is that they are ordained by both prophecy and divine command to restore the church of God as it was in the Book of Acts. Most of Daniel Layne&#x27;s beliefs concerning the book of Revelation originated from some ministers who had left the Church of God (Anderson) reformation movement thirty or so years earlier. This teaching is upheld by the official eschatology, which is a form of church historicism. This Church of God (Restoration) teaches that the 7th Trumpet in the book of the Revelation began to sound around the year 1980 when Daniel Layne was saved, alleging that there was a general discontent among many of its current adherents that were in various Churches of God at that time. A variation of this &quot;Seventh Seal message&quot; had been taught in other Churches of God for approximately 50 years prior to this point.

===Iglesia ni Cristo===

&quot;Iglesia ni Cristo&quot; began in the Philippines and was incorporated by Felix Y. Manalo on July 27, 1914. The church professes to be the reestablishment of the original church founded by Jesus Christ and teaches that the original church was apostatized. It does not teach the doctrine of the Trinity or the divinity of Jesus. &quot;Iglesia ni Cristo&quot; does not subscribe to the term &quot;Restoration&quot; or claim to be a part of the &quot;Restoration Movement&quot;.

=== La Luz del Mundo ===

&quot;La Luz del Mundo&quot; (full name: &quot;Iglesia del Dios Vivo, Columna y Apoyo de la Verdad, La Luz del Mundo&quot;) was founded in Mexico on 6 April 1926 by Eusebio Joaquín González (14 August 1896 – 9 June 1964), who claimed that God called him to be an apostle of Jesus Christ and renamed him Aarón. Joaquín claimed that he was commissioned to restore the primitive Christian church of the first century CE. The church, headquartered in Guadalajara, Mexico, asserts that all other forms of Christianity are corruptions that arose after the last of the original apostles died, and rejects traditional Christian doctrines such as trinitarianism, original sin, veneration of saints, and the divinity of Jesus. 

It continues to claim that it is the restoration of primitive Christianity and that its leaders, including Aarón Joaquín, his son, Samuel Joaquín Flores (1937 – 2014), and his grandson, Naasón Joaquín García (born 1969), who is the church&#x27;s international director, are apostles responsible for the restoration, without whom it would be impossible for people to truly believe in Jesus and be saved.

=== Apostolic Catholic Church (Philippines) ===

The Apostolic Catholic Church started as a mainstream Catholic lay organization that was founded in Hermosa Bataan in the early 1970s by Maria Virginia P. Leonzon Vda. De Teruel. In 1991, the organisation and the Roman Catholic Church had a schism; due to varying issues, it formally separated itself from the Roman Catholic Church, when John Florentine Teruel was consecrated as a patriarch and registered the church as a Protestant and Independent Catholic denomination. The Church describes itself as a Conservative Church which aims to bring back Ancient Catholic Church traditions removed by previous councils and Popes.

===Local churches===
The local churches are a Christian movement influenced by the teachings of J.N. Darby, Watchman Nee and Witness Lee and associated with the Living Stream Ministry publishing house. Its members see themselves as separate from other Christian groups, denominations, and movements, part of what they sometimes call &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Recovery&quot;. One of the defining features of the local churches is their adherence to the principle that all Christians in a city or locality are automatically members of the one church in that locality. Another defining feature is the lack of an official organization or official name for the movement. Those in the local churches believe that to take a name would divide them from other believers. Thus, they often say they meet with &quot;the church in [city name]&quot; with the understanding that they are not the only church but belong to the same church as every believer in their city.

===Jesuism===

Jesuism is the personal philosophy encompassing the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth and commitment or adherence to those teachings. Jesuism is distinct from and sometimes opposed to mainstream Christianity, the organized religion based on the Christian Bible. In particular, Jesuism is distinguished from the writings attributed to the Apostle Paul and from modern Church doctrine. Jesuism is not necessarily critical of the Christian Bible or Church doctrine, but rather it does not affirm their authority over the teachings of Jesus. As a philosophy, Jesuism is characterized as naturalistic and rationalist, rejecting the conflict between faith and science.

===World Mission Society Church Of God===

World Mission Society Church of God is a non-denominational Christian movement founded by Ahn Sahng-Hong in 1964. The church claims to be a restoration of the original Church of God and has teachings differing from other Christian denominations. After Ahn Sahng-hong died in February 1985, a group of people in Church of God Jesus Witnesses including the man Kim Joo-cheol and the woman Zahng Gil-jah wanted to re-introduce the concept of a &quot;spiritual mother&quot;. In March 1985, they moved from Busan to Seoul. At a meeting in Seoul in June 1985, they discussed how to call Zahng Gil-jah, and established a church called Witnesses of Ahn Sahng-hong Church of God which is led by Kim Joo-cheol and Zahng Gil-jah. Two major new doctrines were codified:

Ahn Sahng-hong should be regarded as Jesus Christ who had already come, should be titled Christ Ahn Sahng-hong, and pursuant to a traditional trinitarian view of Christian hypostasis Ahn was consequently also The Holy Spirit, God the Father, and thus God.
Zahng Gil-jah should be regarded as God the Mother, a female image of God, be titled Heavenly Mother, or simply Mother, and together with Ahn Sahng-hong be regarded as God.

<doc id="264085" wikidata="Q1214667" url="?curid=264085" title="Great Disappointment">
<text>The Great Disappointment in the Millerite movement was the reaction that followed Baptist preacher William Miller&#x27;s proclamation that Jesus Christ would return to the Earth by 1844, which he called the Second Advent. His study of the Daniel 8 prophecy during the Second Great Awakening led him to conclude that Daniel&#x27;s &quot;cleansing of the sanctuary&quot; was cleansing the world from sin when Christ would come, and he and many others prepared. When Jesus did not appear by October 22, 1844, Miller and his followers were disappointed.

These events paved the way for the Adventists who formed the Seventh-day Adventist Church. They contended that what had happened on October 22 was not Jesus&#x27;s return, as Miller had thought, but the start of Jesus&#x27;s final work of atonement, the cleansing in the heavenly sanctuary, leading up to the Second Coming.

==Miller&#x27;s apocalyptic claims==

Between 1831 and 1844, on the basis of his study of the Bible, and particularly the prophecy of Daniel 8:14—&quot;Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed&quot;—William Miller, a rural New York farmer and Baptist lay preacher, predicted and preached the return of Jesus Christ to the earth. Miller&#x27;s teachings form the theological foundation of Seventh-day Adventism. Four topics were especially important:

# Miller&#x27;s use of the Bible;
# his eschatology;
# his perspective on the first and second angel&#x27;s messages of Revelation 14; and;
# the seven-month movement that ended with the &quot;Great Disappointment&quot;.

===Miller&#x27;s use of the Bible===
Miller&#x27;s approach was thorough and methodical, intensive and extensive. His central principle for interpreting the Bible was that &quot;all scripture is necessary&quot; and that no part should be bypassed. To understand a doctrine, Miller said one needed to &quot;bring all scriptures together on the subject you wish to know; then let every word have its proper influence, and if you can form your theory without a contradiction you cannot be in error.&quot; He held that the Bible should be its own expositor. By comparing scripture with scripture a person could unlock the meaning of the Bible. In that way the Bible became a person&#x27;s authority, whereas if a creed of other individuals or their writings served as the basis of authority, then that external authority became central rather than the teaching of the Bible itself. Miller&#x27;s guidelines concerning the interpretation of Bible prophecy was built upon the same concepts set forth in his general rules. The Bible, so far as Miller and his followers were concerned, was the supreme authority in all matters of faith and doctrine.

===Second Advent===
The Millerite movement was primarily concerned with the return of Jesus, literally, visually, in the clouds of heaven. The French Revolution was one of several factors that caused many Bible students around the world who shared Miller&#x27;s concerns to delve into the time prophecies of Daniel using the historicist methodology of interpretation. They concluded, to their satisfaction, that the end of the 1,260-&quot;day&quot; prophecy of Daniel 7:25 in 1798 started the era of &quot;time of the end&quot;. They next considered the 2,300 &quot;days&quot; of Daniel 8:14.


There were three things that Miller determined about this text:
# that the 2,300 symbolic days represented 2,300 real years, as evidenced in Ezekiel 4:6 and Numbers 14:34;
# that the sanctuary represents the earth or church; and
# by referring to 2 Peter 3:7, that the 2,300 years ended with the burning of the earth at the Second Advent.

Miller tied the 2,300-day vision to the Prophecy of Seventy Weeks in Daniel 9 where a beginning date is given. He concluded that the 70 weeks (or 70 sevens, or 490 days) were the first 490 years of the 2,300 years. The 490 years were to begin with the command to rebuild and restore Jerusalem. The Bible records four decrees concerning Jerusalem after the Babylonian captivity:

# 536 BC: Decree by Cyrus to rebuild the temple.
# 519 BC: Decree by Darius I to finish the temple.
# 457 BC: Decree by Artaxerxes I of Persia.
# 444 BC: Decree by Artaxerxes to Nehemiah to finish the wall at Jerusalem.

The decree by Artaxerxes empowered Ezra to ordain laws and to set up magistrates and judges for the restored Jewish state. It also gave him unlimited funds to rebuild whatever he wanted at Jerusalem.

Miller concluded that 457 BC was the beginning of the 2,300-day (or -year) prophecy, which meant that it would end about 1843–1844 (457 BC + 2300 years = 1843 AD). And so, too, the Second Advent would happen about that time.

Miller assumed that the &quot;cleansing of the sanctuary&quot; represented purification of the earth by fire at Christ&#x27;s Second Coming. Using an interpretive principle known as the day-year principle, Miller, along with others, interpreted a prophetic &quot;day&quot; to read not as a 24-hour period, but rather a calendar year. Miller became convinced that the 2,300-day period started in 457 BC, the date of the decree to rebuild Jerusalem by Artaxerxes I of Persia. His interpretation led Miller to believeand predict, despite urging of his supportersthat Christ would return in &quot;about 1843&quot;. Miller narrowed the time period to sometime in the Jewish year 5604, stating: &quot;My principles in brief, are, that Jesus Christ will come again to this earth, cleanse, purify, and take possession of the same, with all the saints, sometime between March 21, 1843, and March 21, 1844.&quot; March 21, 1844, passed without incident, but the majority of Millerites maintained their faith.

After further discussion and study, Miller briefly adopted a new date—April 18, 1844—one based on the Karaite Jewish calendar (as opposed to the Rabbinic calendar). Like the previous date, April 18 passed without Christ&#x27;s return. In the &quot;Advent Herald&quot; of April 24, Joshua Himes wrote that all the &quot;expected and published time&quot; had passed and admitted that they had been &quot;mistaken in the precise time of the termination of the prophetic period&quot;. Josiah Litch surmised that the Adventists were probably &quot;only in error relative to the event which marked its close&quot;. Miller published a letter &quot;To Second Advent Believers,&quot; writing, &quot;I confess my error, and acknowledge my disappointment; yet I still believe that the day of the Lord is near, even at the door.&quot;

In August 1844, at a camp meeting in Exeter, New Hampshire, Samuel S. Snow presented a new interpretation, which became known as the &quot;seventh-month message&quot; or the &quot;true midnight cry&quot;. In a complex discussion based on scriptural typology, Snow presented his conclusion (still based on the 2,300-day prophecy in Daniel 8:14) that Christ would return on &quot;the tenth day of the seventh month of the present year, 1844&quot;. Using the calendar of the Karaite Jews, he determined this date to be October 22, 1844. This &quot;seventh-month message&quot; &quot;spread with a rapidity unparalleled in the Millerites experience&quot; amongst the general population.

==October 22, 1844==
October 22 passed without incident, resulting in feelings of disappointment among many Millerites. Henry Emmons, a Millerite, later wrote,

==Repercussions==
The Millerites had to deal with their own shattered expectations, as well as considerable criticism and even violence from the public. Many followers had given up their possessions in expectation of Christ&#x27;s return. On November 18, 1844, Miller wrote to Himes about his experiences:

There were also the instances of violence: a Millerite church was burned in Ithaca, New York, and two were vandalized in Dansville and Scottsville. In Loraine, Illinois, a mob attacked the Millerite congregation with clubs and knives, while a group in Toronto was tarred and feathered. Shots were fired at another Canadian group meeting in a private house.

Both Millerite leaders and followers were left generally bewildered and disillusioned. Responses varied: some continued to look daily for Christ&#x27;s return, while others predicted different dates—among them April, July, and October 1845. Some theorized that the world had entered the seventh millennium—the &quot;Great Sabbath&quot;, and that therefore, the saved should not work. Others acted as children, basing their belief on Jesus&#x27; words in Mark 10:15: &quot;Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.&quot; Millerite J. D. Pickands used Revelation 14:14–16 to teach that Christ was now sitting on a white cloud and must be prayed down. It has been speculated that the majority simply gave up their beliefs and attempted to rebuild their lives. Some members rejoined their previous denominations. A substantial number joined the Shakers.

By mid-1845, doctrinal lines among the various Millerite groups began to solidify, and the groups emphasized their differences, in a process George R. Knight terms &quot;sect building&quot;. During this time, there were three main Millerite groups—in addition to those who had simply given up their beliefs.

The first major division of the Millerite groups who retained a belief in Christ&#x27;s Second Advent were those who focused on the &quot;shut-door&quot; belief. Popularized by Joseph Turner, this belief was based on a key Millerite passage, Matthew 25:1–13; the Parable of the Ten Virgins.

The shut door mentioned in Matthew 25:11–12 was interpreted as the close of probation. As Knight explains, &quot;After the door was shut, there would be no additional salvation. The wise virgins (true believers) would be in the kingdom, while the foolish virgins and all others would be on the outside.&quot;

The widespread acceptance of the shut-door belief lost ground as doubts were raised about the significance of the October 22, 1844, date—if nothing happened on that date, then there could be no shut door. The opposition to these shut-door beliefs was led by Himes and make up the second post-1844 group. This faction soon gained the upper hand, even converting Miller to their point of view. Their influence was enhanced by the staging of the Albany Conference. The Advent Christian Church has its roots in this post-Great Disappointment group.

The third major post-disappointment Millerite group also claimed, like the Hale- and Turner-led group, that the October 22 date was correct. Rather than Christ having returned invisibly, however, they concluded that the event that took place on October 22, 1844, was quite different. The theology of this third group appears to have had its beginnings as early as October 23, 1844—the day after the Great Disappointment. On that day, during a prayer session with a group of Advent believers, Hiram Edson became convinced that &quot;light would be given&quot; and their &quot;disappointment explained&quot;.

Edson&#x27;s experience led him into an extended study on the topic with O. R. L. Crosier and F. B. Hahn. They came to the conclusion that Miller&#x27;s assumption that the sanctuary represented the earth was in error. &quot;The sanctuary to be cleansed in Daniel 8:14 was not the earth or the church, but the sanctuary in heaven.&quot; Therefore, the October 22 date marked not the Second Coming of Christ, but rather a heavenly event. Out of this third group arose the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and this interpretation of the Great Disappointment forms the basis for the Seventh-day Adventist doctrine of the pre-Advent Divine Investigative Judgement. Their interpretations were published in early 1845 in the &quot;Day Dawn&quot;.

==Connection to the Baháʼí Faith==
Members of the Baháʼí Faith believe that Miller&#x27;s interpretation of signs and dates of the coming of Jesus were, for the most part, correct. They believe that the fulfillment of biblical prophecies of the coming of Christ came through a forerunner of their own religion, the Báb, who declared that he was the &quot;Promised One&quot; on May 23, 1844, and began openly teaching in Persia in October 1844. Several Baháʼí books and pamphlets make mention of the Millerites, the prophecies used by Miller and the Great Disappointment, most notably Baháʼí follower William Sears&#x27; &quot;Thief in the Night&quot;.

It was noted that the year AD 1844 was also the Year AH 1260. Sears tied Daniel&#x27;s prophecies in with the Book of Revelation in the New Testament in support of Baháʼí teaching, interpreting the year 1260 as the &quot;times, time and half a time&quot; of Daniel 7:25 (3 and 1/2 years = 42 months = 1,260 days). Using the same day-year principle as did William Miller, Sears decoded these texts into the year AH 1260, or 1844.

It is believed by Baháʼís that if William Miller had known the year 1844 was also the year AH 1260, then he may have considered that there were other signs to look for. The Baháʼí interpretation of chapters 11 and 12 of the Book of Revelation, together with the predictions of Daniel, were explained by &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, to Laura Clifford Barney and published in 1908 in Chapters 10, 11 and 13 of &quot;Some Answered Questions&quot;. The explanation provided in Chapter 10 draws on the same biblical verses that William Miller used, and comes to the same conclusion about the year in which to expect the &#x27;cleansing of the sanctuary&#x27; which was interpreted by &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá to be the &#x27;dawn&#x27; of a new &#x27;Revelation&#x27; – AD 1844.

==Other views==
The Great Disappointment is viewed by some scholars as an example of the psychological phenomenon of cognitive dissonance. The theory was proposed by Leon Festinger to describe the formation of new beliefs and increased proselytizing in order to reduce the tension, or dissonance, that results from failed prophecies. According to the theory, believers experienced tension following the failure of Jesus&#x27;s reappearance in 1844, which led to a variety of new explanations. The various solutions form a part of the teachings of the different groups that outlived the disappointment.

<text>John Davies of Hereford (c. 1565 – July 1618) was a writing-master and an Anglo-Welsh poet. He referred to himself as &quot;John Davies of Hereford&quot; (after the city where he was born) in order to distinguish himself from others of the same name, particularly the contemporary poet Sir John Davies (1569–1626).

Davies wrote very copiously on theological and philosophical themes, some of which brought proto-scientific ideas into the public arena. He also wrote many epigrams on his contemporaries which have some historical interest. John Davies died in London.

Davies was a friend of Edmund Ashfield, and wrote in an epigram that he nearly accompanied Ashfield on his journey to Scotland in 1599.

These rare editions were compiled by Reverend Alexander Balloch Grosart (1827–1899) into a two-volume edition privately printed in one hundred copies in 1875 and 1878 at the Edinburgh University Press by Thomas and Archibald Constable as part of the &quot;Chertsey Worthies&#x27; library&quot; subscription series. &quot;The complete works of John Davies of Hereford (15??-1618)&quot; was &quot;for the first time collected and edited: with memorial introduction, notes and illustrations, glossarial index, and portrait and facsimile, &amp;c.&quot; Grosart indicated for several of the poems that there was only one extant copy known.

===A Lover&#x27;s Complaint===

In a 2007 monograph, &quot;Shakespeare, &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Complaint,&quot; and John Davies of Hereford&quot;, Brian Vickers attributes to Davies the poem &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Complaint&quot;, which was published by Thomas Thorpe with &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnets&quot; in 1609. This attribution goes against scholarly consensus, and in particular studies by Kenneth Muir, Eliot Slater and MacDonald P. Jackson, but is based on both a detailed demonstration of the non-Shakespearean nature of the poem and a list of numerous verbal parallels—such as &#x27;What brest so cold that is not warmed heare&#x27; and &#x27;What heart&#x27;s so cold that is not set on fire&#x27;—between the &quot;Complaint&quot; and the known works of Davies. On Vickers&#x27;s attribution it was omitted from the 2007 &quot;RSC Shakespeare Complete Works&quot;, a decision Jackson called a mistake in his &quot;RES&quot; review of Vickers&#x27;s book, arguing, among other reservations, that &quot;Evidence that, in poems undoubtedly his, Davies exhibits an intimacy with Shakespeare&#x27;s works equal to that of the author of &#x27;A Lover&#x27;s Complaint&#x27; is very meagre.&quot;

<doc id="264089" wikidata="Q3930958" url="?curid=264089" title="Reading Rainbow">
<text>Reading Rainbow is an American educational children&#x27;s television series that originally aired on PBS and afterward PBS Kids from July 11, 1983 to November 10, 2006, with reruns continuing to air until August 28, 2009. 155 30-minute episodes were produced over 23 seasons. Before its official premiere, the show aired for test audiences in the Nebraska and Buffalo, New York markets (their PBS member stations, the Nebraska ETV [now Nebraska Public Media] and WNED-TV, respectively, were co-producers of the show).

The purpose of the show was to encourage a love of books and reading among children. In 2012, an iPad and Kindle Fire educational interactive book reading and video field trip application was launched bearing the name of the program.

The public television series garnered over 200 broadcast awards, including a Peabody Award and 26 Emmy Awards, 10 of which were in the &quot;Outstanding Children&#x27;s Series&quot; category. The concept of a reading series for children originated with Twila Liggett, PhD who in partnership with Cecily Truett Lancit and Larry Lancit, at Lancit Media Productions in New York created the television series. The original team also included Lynne Brenner Ganek, Ellen Schecter, and host LeVar Burton. The show&#x27;s title was conceived by an unknown intern at WNED.

Each episode centered on a topic from a featured children&#x27;s book that was explored through a number of on-location segments or stories. The show also recommended books for children to look for when they went to the library.

After the show&#x27;s cancellation on November 10, 2006, reruns aired until August 28, 2009, when it was removed from the schedule. At the time, it was the third-longest running children&#x27;s series in PBS history, after &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;. It was the first PBS children&#x27;s show to be broadcast in stereo sound. On June 20, 2012, the Reading Rainbow App was released for the iPad and, within 36 hours, became the #1 most-downloaded educational app in the iTunes App Store. Developed by LeVar Burton and his company, RRKIDZ, the app allows children to read unlimited books, explore video field trips starring Burton, and earn rewards for reading. On the week of July 11, 2013, &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; celebrated its 30th anniversary.

In May 2014, a Kickstarter campaign was launched to raise funds to make the app available online and for Android, game consoles, smartphones, and other streaming devices along with creating a classroom version with the subscription fee waived for up to 13,000 disadvantaged classrooms. The effort met its initial fundraising goal of $1,000,000 in 11 hours, and ended a few days later at $5,408,916 from 105,857 backers. This campaign led to the launch of &quot;Skybrary by Reading Rainbow&quot;, a web-based expansion of the Reading Rainbow app experience.

Due to a legal dispute, licensing of the &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; brand was revoked from RRKidz in October 2017, and all its platforms (including Skybrary) were rebranded to &quot;LeVar Burton Kids&quot;.

An interactive revival titled &quot;Reading Rainbow Live&quot; debuted on Looped in March 2022.

==Overview==
===Format===
&quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; was hosted by actor and executive producer LeVar Burton, who was then known for his role in &quot;Roots&quot;. The show was produced first by Lancit Media Entertainment (1983–2001), and later On-Screen Entertainment (2002–2006). Every episode featured a different children&#x27;s picture book, often narrated by a celebrity. The featured story&#x27;s illustrations were scanned by the camera in a technique known as &quot;iconographic animation&quot; of each page shown in succession, although on certain occasions the shots would be animated.

After the featured story, Burton visited many places relating to the episode&#x27;s theme, often featuring interviews with guests. A notable example is the season 6 premiere episode, which featured the book &quot;The Bionic Bunny Show&quot; by Marc Brown and his wife Laurene, and included a behind-the-scenes look at the TV series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, in which Burton was a main cast member.

The last segment of each show, called Book Reviews, began with Burton&#x27;s introductory catchphrase, &quot;But you don&#x27;t have to take my word for it,&quot; and featured children giving capsule reviews of books they liked. At the end of almost every episode, Burton signed off by telling the audience &quot;I&#x27;ll see you next time&quot;, with a review of the books featured in that episode beginning in season 2.

The series&#x27; pilot, which was created and produced in 1981 and aired as the show&#x27;s 8th episode in 1983, featured the book &quot;Gila Monsters Meet You at the Airport&quot; by Marjorie Weinman Sharmat and was narrated by Doug Parvin. Producer Larry Lancit&#x27;s daughters, Shaune and Caitlin, were often featured in the series, notably as the children thanking the sponsors at the beginning and end of the show.

===Theme song and opening sequence===
The show&#x27;s theme song was written by Steve Horelick, Dennis Neil Kleinman, and Janet Weir; the former also served as the series&#x27; music director and composer for all 155 episodes and received an Emmy nomination in 2007 for his work on the series. Over the show&#x27;s 23-year run, it went through three different versions of the theme song. The original theme (used from 1983 to 1999) was performed by Tina Fabrique and featured one of the first uses of the Buchla synthesizer in a TV theme song. The original opening sequence, which consisted of an animated butterfly transforming the surroundings of young children reading books into animated fantasy lands, was used until January 1, 1999. The introductory animation was produced by Ovation Films, Inc. and designed and animated by Bill Davis. Some episodes (from 1983 through 1999) had the end credits having the full version of the 1983-1999 theme song (sung by the same singer—Tina Fabrique) --with some episodes (with the said song) repeating two or three times.

On January 4, 1999, episodes began using a new live-action opening sequence and featured CGI in a new space-themed world, with a new arrangement of the original song by Steve Horelick and performed by Johnny Kemp. A third intro was used starting on May 8, 2000, with a rerecorded version and the original lyrics performed by R&amp;B artist Chaka Khan. This opening sequence is mostly the same as the second one, but features footage of Burton in place of some of the animated elements.

===Later years===
Original production of the series was to have ended after April 4, 2005, with the show continuing to air in reruns, but Burton said on February 7, 2006, that five new episodes of the show would be shot the same year despite the continuing financial issues of PBS. The show aired its final original episode on November 10, 2006, and continued to air reruns until August 28, 2009.

Not only was PBS unable to secure enough funds to cover the costs associated with renewing broadcast rights and continuing reruns, the show&#x27;s core philosophy was challenged as well. &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; prominently featured published books throughout each episode, and licensing those books to be read aloud on the air was costly—an expensive move that producing station WNED decided not to make. Prior to the cancellation, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the U.S. Department of Education provided funds for the production of &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; and a number of other PBS children&#x27;s series throughout the early 2000s. The &quot;Ready to Learn&quot; grant was designed for television programming that encourage early childhood learning and development. However, under the No Child Left Behind Act, this grant was focused much more narrowly toward programs that teach literacy skills, phonics, and spelling after 2005. Since &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; was originally developed upon fostering a love of reading books, and not necessarily developing reading skills, the funding was redirected toward other programs, and led to the launch of new skills-based programming, like 
&quot;Super Why!&quot;, &quot;WordWorld&quot;, and a reboot of &quot;The Electric Company&quot;.

In spring 2024, reruns of the show began airing on the free streaming channel PBS Retro and toward the end 2024 on a free streaming channel on Amazon Prime Video, where it has also been available on demand and through the PBS Kids subscription service.

==Reboot==
===Announcement and early developments (2010–2014)===
Former executive producer LeVar Burton announced on his Twitter feed on March 19, 2010, that &quot;Reading Rainbow 2.0 is in the works.&quot; In 2011, WNED, the PBS affiliate in Buffalo, New York that owns the Reading Rainbow brand, licensed rights to the brand to Burton and his company, RRKidz. On March 4, 2012, he announced that it was the &quot;last day of shooting before launch!&quot;

On June 13, 2012, in a special presentation at Apple Inc&#x27;s annual World Wide Developers Conference, Burton and his business partner, Mark Wolfe, introduced the new &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; iPad App. It became available in Apple&#x27;s iTunes Store on June 20, 2012, and within 36 hours was the #1 educational app. In January 2014, the Reading Rainbow App surpassed 10M books read and video field trips watched by children in 18 months.

===Kickstarter revival campaign and aftermath (2014–22)===
On May 28, 2014, LeVar Burton started a Kickstarter fund to revive the show and materials. In under 12 hours the show had reached its $1 million goal. The new goal was to create an educational version for schools to use, free of cost to those schools in need, and help America get back to high literacy rates. They are also going to create a website for students to use to assist them with learning how to read. The following day, May 29, 2014, they reached $2million (double their goal) at 1:15 pm. PST. The campaign raised $5,408,916 on Kickstarter with another $1million from &quot;Family Guy&quot; creator/animator Seth MacFarlane and $70,000 raised via direct contributions. The grand total was $6,478,916.

With 105,857 backers, the campaign holds Kickstarter&#x27;s record for most backers and is the 8th highest amount raised on Kickstarter (as of June 1, 2015).

The first product of the Kickstarter campaign was &quot;Skybrary by Reading Rainbow&quot;. Launched in May 2015, it was a web based subscription service that duplicated the Reading Rainbow app experience. In addition to narrating many of the books, Burton hosted video fieldtrips which connected kids to real world experiences at places like NASA HQ and Niagara Falls.

In March 2016, RRKidz launched a new online educational service called &quot;Reading Rainbow Skybrary for Schools&quot;, which followed the same mission of the television series, while expanding to integrate into classroom curriculums.

In August 2017, WNED filed a wide-ranging lawsuit against Burton and RRKidz that demanded Burton&#x27;s company hand over administrative access to other websites and social media accounts. The lawsuit also sought to enjoin Burton from using the &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; catchphrase, &quot;But you don&#x27;t have to take my word for it,&quot; on his podcast.

In October 2017, WNED and RRKidz settled out of court. While the exact terms were confidential, the result was that RRKidz was no longer a licensee of the &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; brand. RRKidz was rebranded &quot;LeVar Burton Kids&quot; and its services (including Skybrary) removed references to Reading Rainbow. In addition, Burton was allowed to continue using the &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; catchphrase. Visiting the official &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; website provided a page that stated &quot;Recent legal disputes between WNED and LeVar Burton/RRKIDZ have been resolved and RRKIDZ no longer licenses the &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; brand from WNED. WNED is currently working on the next chapter of &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; and will continue its mission of fostering education for a new generation.&quot;

WNED announced in November 2018 that research and development had begun on a new &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; program thanks to a $200,000 grant from The John R. Oishei Foundation.

Skybrary was acquired by Reading is Fundamental in March 2019.

In December 2021, it was announced that the show would be revived as &quot;Reading Rainbow Live&quot;, an interactive version featuring multiple hosts, dubbed &quot;The Rainbows&quot;. The series debuted on Looped on March 6, 2022.

It was renamed to the &quot;PBS Kids Writers Contest&quot; in 2014.

==History==

===London Airport, 1929–1942===

In January 1927 the City of London selected a site for an airfield at Lambeth, Ontario near ; the adjacent section of Wonderland Road to the east between Southdale and Exeter was named Airport Road up through 1989 when the town of Westminster was established and all rural roads were named by the town. A group of local businessmen acquired the site in 1928 and by 3 May 1929 an airport license was issued to London Airport Ltd. The London Flying Club was formed in 1928 and became a tenant of the new airport. The airfield was used for flying instruction, private aviation, and for air mail. By 1933 it had become too small for some commercial aircraft.

The London Flying Club continued to use the Lambeth airfield until 7 August 1942.

===London City Airport, 1940–1945===

In 1935 the city decided to replace the original London Airport. Site surveys and consultations took place and on 9 September 1939, at the start of World War II, work began on a new airport located near Crumlin. The city leased the new airport to the Government of Canada, Department of Transport on 24 January 1940 for the duration of the war.

Runways 14-32 and 05-23 were paved and ready for use by July 1940 and the Royal Canadian Air Force established RCAF Station Crumlin on part of the airport. This air station was host to No. 3 Elementary Flying Training School (EFTS) and No. 4 Air Observer School (AOS), both part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan.

The airport remained under civilian management and was used for civil and military aviation during the war years. The licence for London City Airport was issued on 6 May 1941. Improvements made during this time include:

* main terminal building (civilian) opened in July 1942
* Trans-Canada Airlines began serve to the airport in July 1942.
* runway 08-26 added in 1943.

British Commonwealth Air Training Plan operations ended on 31 December 1944 with the closure of No. 4 Air Observer School.

The Royal Air Force Transport Command, No. 45 Group established the Mosquito Preparation and Despatching Unit at London on 10 January 1945. This detachment had twenty three members and test flew De Havilland Mosquitos built in Toronto before they were flown overseas.

After the war the airport remained under the control of the Department of Transport.

====Aerodrome information====
In approximately 1942 the aerodrome was listed at with a Var. 5 degrees W and elevation of . Two runways were listed as follows:


===Postwar RCAF operations 1945–1961===
After World War II RCAF reserve or &quot;auxiliary&quot; squadrons were given the task of defending Canada&#x27;s major cities. 420 Squadron reformed as City of London 420 (Fighter) Auxiliary Squadron at the airport in September 1948. Initially equipped with Harvard aircraft, the squadron upgraded to Mustangs in 1952 and Canadair CT-133 jets in 1954. The squadron disbanded in 1957. Air Defence Command reformed 2420 Aircraft Control and Warning (Auxiliary) Squadron at London on 1 July 1956. 2420 trained Fighter Control operators and disbanded on 31 May 1961.

RCAF Station London opened in 1950 to support a NATO Induction and Training Centre, later moved to Centralia. The station closed on 30 September 1958.

As a tribute to this period, a Canadair CT-133 aircraft in former Royal Canadian Air Force livery is mounted in front of the main terminal building.

===Capital improvements since 1950===

The airport has been continuously improved since World War II as navigation and air traffic control systems evolved, and as commercial aircraft became larger and larger. These improvements include:

* 1950, installation of the Instrument Landing System (ILS) on runway 14-32
* 1955, runway 14-32 lengthened to 6,000 feet to accommodate the Vickers Viscount

<text>Dorothy Day, OblSB (November 8, 1897 – November 29, 1980) was an American journalist, social activist and anarchist who, after a bohemian youth, became a Catholic without abandoning her social activism. She was perhaps the best-known political radical among American Catholics.

Day&#x27;s conversion is described in her 1952 autobiography, &quot;The Long Loneliness&quot;. Day was also an active journalist, and described her social activism in her writings. In 1917 she was imprisoned as a member of suffragist Alice Paul&#x27;s nonviolent Silent Sentinels. In the 1930s, Day worked closely with fellow activist Peter Maurin to establish the Catholic Worker Movement, a pacifist movement that combines direct aid for the poor and homeless with nonviolent direct action on their behalf. She practiced civil disobedience, which led to additional arrests in 1955, 1957, and in 1973 at age 75. 

As part of the Catholic Worker Movement, Day co-founded the &quot;Catholic Worker&quot; newspaper in 1933, and served as its editor from 1933 until her death in 1980. In this newspaper, Day advocated the Catholic economic theory of distributism, which she considered a third way between capitalism and socialism. Pope Benedict XVI used her conversion story as an example of how to &quot;journey towards faith… in a secularized environment.&quot; In an address before the United States Congress, Pope Francis included her in a list of four exemplary Americans who &quot;buil[t] a better future&quot;. 

The Catholic Church has opened the cause for Day&#x27;s possible canonization, which was accepted by the Holy See. For that reason, the Church refers to her with the title Servant of God.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Dorothy May Day was born on November 8, 1897 in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. She was born into a family described by one biographer as &quot;solid, patriotic, and middle class&quot;. Her father, John Day, was a Tennessee native of Irish heritage, while her mother, Grace Satterlee, a native of upstate New York, was of English ancestry. Her parents were married in an Episcopal church in Greenwich Village. She had three brothers (including Donald S. Day) and a sister and was the third oldest child. In 1904, her father, a sportswriter devoted to horse racing, took a position with a newspaper in San Francisco. The family lived in Oakland, California, until the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 destroyed the newspaper&#x27;s facilities, and her father lost his job. From the spontaneous response to the earthquake&#x27;s devastation, the self-sacrifice of neighbors in a time of crisis, Day drew a lesson about individual action and the Christian community. The family relocated to Chicago.

Day&#x27;s parents were nominal Christians who rarely attended church. As a young child, she showed a marked religious streak, reading the Bible frequently. When she was ten, she started to attend the Church of Our Saviour, an Episcopal church in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago, after its rector convinced her mother to let Day&#x27;s brothers join the church choir. She was taken with the liturgy and its music. She studied the catechism and was baptized and confirmed in that church in 1911.

Day was an avid reader in her teens, particularly fond of Upton Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle&quot;. She worked from one book to another, noting Jack London&#x27;s mention of Herbert Spencer in &quot;Martin Eden&quot;, and then from Spencer to Darwin and Huxley. She learned about anarchy and extreme poverty from Peter Kropotkin, who promoted the belief that only cooperation and mutual aid could create a truly free society. She also enjoyed Russian literature while in university studies, especially Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Gorky. Day read a lot of socially conscious work, which gave her a background for her future; it helped bolster her support for and involvement in social activism. Day graduated from Robert Waller High School in 1914.

In 1914, Day attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign on a scholarship. She was a reluctant scholar. Her reading was chiefly in a Christian radical social direction. She avoided campus social life, and supported herself rather than rely on money from her father, buying all her clothing and shoes from discount stores. She left the university after two years, and moved to New York City.

===Social activism===
She settled on the Lower East Side of New York and worked on the staff of several Socialist publications, including &quot;The Liberator&quot;, &quot;The Masses&quot;, and &quot;The Call&quot;. She &quot;smilingly explained to impatient socialists that she was &#x27;a pacifist even in the class war.&#x27;&quot; Years later, Day described how she was pulled in different directions: &quot;I was only eighteen, so I wavered between my allegiance to Socialism, Syndicalism (of the Industrial Workers of the World – I.W.W.) and Anarchism. When I read Tolstoy I was an Anarchist. My allegiance to &quot;The Call&quot; kept me a Socialist, although a left-wing one, and my Americanism inclined me to the I.W.W. movement.&quot;

She celebrated the February Revolution in Russia in 1917, the overthrow of the monarchy and establishment of a reformist government. In November 1917, she was arrested for picketing at the White House on behalf of women&#x27;s suffrage as part of a campaign called the Silent Sentinels organized by Alice Paul and the National Woman&#x27;s Party. Sentenced to 30 days in jail, she served 15 days before being released, ten of them on a hunger strike.

Day spent several months in Greenwich Village, where she became close to Eugene O&#x27;Neill, whom she later credited with having produced &quot;an intensification of the religious sense that was in me.&quot; She had a love affair of several years with Mike Gold, a radical writer who later became a prominent Communist. Later she credited Gold with being &quot;indirect involved&quot; in the beginning of the Catholic Worker Movement. Day maintained friendships with such prominent American Communists as Anna Louise Strong and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn who became the head of the Communist Party USA.

Initially, Day lived a bohemian life. In 1920, after ending an unhappy love affair with Lionel Moise, and after having an abortion that was &quot;the great tragedy of her life&quot;, she married Berkeley Tobey in a civil ceremony. She spent the better part of a year with him in Europe, removed from politics, focusing on art and literature, and writing a semi-autobiographical novel, &quot;The Eleventh Virgin&quot; (1924), based on her affair with Moise. In its &quot;Epilogue&quot;, she tried to draw lessons about the status of women from her experience: &quot;I thought I was a free and emancipated young woman and found out I wasn&#x27;t at all. …Freedom is just a modernity gown, a new trapping that we women affect to capture the man we want.&quot; She ended her marriage to Tobey upon their return to the United States.

Day later called &quot;The Eleventh Virgin&quot; a &quot;very bad book&quot;. The sale of the movie rights to the novel gave her $2,500, and she bought a beach cottage as a writing retreat on Staten Island, New York. Soon she found a new lover, Forster Batterham, an activist and biologist, who joined her there on weekends. She lived there from 1925 to 1929, entertaining friends and enjoying a romantic relationship that foundered when she took passionately to motherhood and religion.

Day, who had thought herself sterile following her abortion, was delighted to find she was pregnant in mid-1925, while Batterham dreaded fatherhood. While she visited her mother in Florida, separating from Batterham for several months, she intensified her exploration of Catholicism. When she returned to Staten Island, Batterham found her increasing devotion, attendance at Mass, and religious reading incomprehensible. Soon after the birth of their daughter Tamar Teresa, on March 4, 1926, Day encountered a local Sister of Charity, Aloysia Mary Mulhern, and with her help educated herself in the Catholic faith and had her baby baptized in July 1927. Batterham refused to attend the ceremony. His relationship with Day became increasingly unbearable, as her desire for marriage in the Church confronted his antipathy to organized religion, Catholicism most of all. After one last fight in late December, Day refused to allow him to return. On December 28, she underwent conditional baptism in the Catholic Church with Sister Aloysia as her godparent, at the Church of Our Lady Help of Christians.

In the summer of 1929, to put Batterham behind her, Day accepted a job writing film dialogue for Pathé Motion Pictures and moved to Los Angeles with Tamar. A few months later, following the 1929 stock market crash, her contract was not renewed. She returned to New York via a sojourn in Mexico and a family visit in Florida. Day supported herself as a journalist, writing a gardening column for the local paper, the &quot;Staten Island Advance&quot;, and feature articles and book reviews for several Catholic publications, including &quot;Commonweal&quot;.

In 1932, inspired by conversations with Mike Gold&#x27;s brother George, a leader of the upcoming Hunger March in Washington D.C., she traveled to Washington to report on the march for Commonweal. Her experience there motivated her decision to take a greater role in social activism and Catholicism. During the hunger strikes in D.C. in December 1932, she wrote of being filled with pride watching the marchers, but she could not do much with her conversion. She comments in her autobiography: &quot;I could write, I could protest, to arouse the conscience, but where was the Catholic leadership in the gathering of bands of men and women together, for the actual works of mercy that the comrades had always made part of their technique in reaching the workers?&quot; Later, she visited the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in northeast D.C. to offer a prayer to find a way to use her gifts and talents to help her fellow workers and the poor.

===Catholic Worker Movement===
In 1932, Day met Peter Maurin, the man she always credited as the founder of the movement with which she is identified. Maurin, a French immigrant and something of a vagabond, had entered the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools in his native France, before emigrating, first to Canada, then to the United States.

Despite his lack of formal education, Maurin was a man of deep intellect and decidedly strong views. He had a vision of social justice and its connection with the poor, which was partly inspired by St. Francis of Assisi. He had a vision of action based on sharing ideas and subsequent action by the poor themselves. Maurin was deeply versed in the writings of the Church Fathers and the papal documents on social matters that had been issued by Pope Leo XIII and his successors. Maurin provided Day with the grounding in Catholic theology of the need for social action they both felt.

Years later Day described how Maurin also broadened her knowledge by bringing &quot;a digest of the writings of Kropotkin one day, calling my attention especially to &quot;Fields, Factories, and Workshops&quot;. Day observed: &quot;I was familiar with Kropotkin only through his &quot;Memoirs of a Revolutionist&quot;, which had originally run serially in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;. She wrote: &quot;Oh, far day of American freedom, when Karl Marx could write for the morning &quot;Tribune&quot; in New York, and Kropotkin could not only be published in the &quot;Atlantic&quot;, but be received as a guest into the homes of New England Unitarians, and in Jane Addams&#x27; Hull House in Chicago!&quot; Maurin drew Day&#x27;s attention to French models and literature.

The Catholic Worker Movement started when the &quot;Catholic Worker&quot; appeared on May 1, 1933, priced at one cent, and published continuously since then. It was aimed at those suffering the most in the depths of the Great Depression, &quot;those who think there is no hope for the future,&quot; and announced to them that &quot;the Catholic Church has a social program. ...There are men of God who are working not only for their spiritual but for their material welfare.&quot; It accepted no advertising and did not pay its staff. Publication of the first issue was supported in part by a $1 donation from Sister Peter Claver, for whom a Catholic Worker house was later named.

Like many newspapers of the day, including those for which Day had been writing, it was an unapologetic example of advocacy journalism. It provided coverage of strikes and explored working conditions, especially women and African American workers, and explained papal teaching on social issues. Its viewpoint was partisan and stories were designed to move its readers to take action locally, for example, by patronizing laundries recommended by the Laundry Workers&#x27; Union. Its advocacy of federal child labor laws put it at odds with the American Church hierarchy from its first issue. Still, Day censored some of Maurin&#x27;s attacks on the Church hierarchy and tried to have a collection of the paper&#x27;s issues presented to Pope Pius XI in 1935.

The paper&#x27;s principal competitor in distribution and ideology was the Communist &quot;Daily Worker&quot;. Day opposed its atheism, its advocacy of &quot;class hatred&quot; and violent revolution, and its opposition to private property. The first issue of the &quot;Catholic Worker&quot; asked: &quot;Is it not possible to be radical and not atheist?&quot; and celebrated its distribution in Union Square on May Day as a direct challenge to the Communists. Day defended government relief programs like the Civilian Conservation Corps that the Communists ridiculed. The &quot;Daily Worker&quot; responded by mocking the &quot;Catholic Worker&quot; for its charity work and expressing sympathy for landlords when calling evictions morally wrong. In this fight, the Church hierarchy backed Day&#x27;s movement and &quot;Commonweal&quot;, a Catholic journal that expressed a wide range of viewpoints, said that Day&#x27;s background positioned her well for her mission: &quot;There are few laymen in this country who are so completely conversant with Communist propaganda and its exponents.&quot; During this time, she became friends with many Catholic authors, including John C. Cort and Harry Sylvester. Sylvester dedicated his fourth novel, &quot;Moon Gaffney&quot;, to Day and Cort.

Over several decades, the &quot;Catholic Worker&quot; attracted such writers and editors as Michael Harrington, Ammon Hennacy, Thomas Merton, and Daniel Berrigan. From the publishing enterprise came a &quot;house of hospitality&quot;, a shelter that provided food and clothing to the poor of the Lower East Side and then a series of farms for communal living. The movement quickly spread to other cities in the United States and to Canada and the United Kingdom. More than 30 independent but affiliated Catholic Worker communities had been founded by 1941.

In 1935, the &quot;Catholic Worker&quot; began publishing articles that articulated a rigorous and uncompromising pacifist position, breaking with the traditional Catholic doctrine of just war theory. The next year, the two sides that fought the Spanish Civil War roughly approximated two of Day&#x27;s allegiances, with the Church allied with Franco fighting radicals of many stripes, the &quot;Catholic&quot; and the &quot;worker&quot; at war with one another. Day refused to follow the Catholic hierarchy in support of Franco against the Republican forces, which were atheist and anticlerical in spirit, led by anarchists and communists (that is, the Republican forces were). She acknowledged the martyrdom of priests and nuns in Spain and said she expected the age of revolution she was living in to require more martyrs: 

The paper&#x27;s circulation fell as many Catholic churches, schools, and hospitals that had previously served as its distribution points withdrew support. Circulation fell from 150,000 to 30,000.

In 1938, she published an account of the transformation of her political activism into religiously motivated activism in &quot;From Union Square to Rome&quot;. She recounted her life story selectively, without providing the details of her early years of &quot;grievous mortal sin&quot; when her life was &quot;pathetic, little, and mean.&quot; She presented it as an answer to communist relatives and friends who have asked: &quot;How could you become a Catholic?&quot;:

The Cardinal&#x27;s Literature Committee of the New York Archdiocese recommended it to Catholic readers.

===Continued activism===
In the early 1940s, she affiliated with the Benedictines, in 1955 professing as an oblate of St. Procopius Abbey, in Lisle, Illinois. This gave her a spiritual practice and connection that sustained her throughout the rest of her life. She was briefly a postulant in the Fraternity of Jesus Caritas, which was inspired by the example of Charles de Foucauld. Day felt unwelcome there and disagreed with how meetings were run. When she withdrew as a candidate for the Fraternity, she wrote to a friend: &quot;I just wanted to let you know that I feel even closer to it all, tho it is not possible for me to be a recognized &#x27;Little Sister,&#x27; or formally a part of it.&quot;

Day reaffirmed her pacifism following the U.S. declaration of war in 1941 and urged noncooperation in a speech that day: &quot;We must make a start. We must renounce war as an instrument of policy. ...Even as I speak to you, I may be guilty of what some men call treason. But we must reject war. ...You young men should refuse to take up arms. Young women tear down the patriotic posters. And all of you – young and old put away your flags.&quot; Her January 1942 column was headlined &quot;We Continue Our Christian Pacifist Stand&quot;. She wrote:

The circulation of the &quot;Catholic Worker&quot;, following its losses during the Spanish Civil War, had risen to 75,000, but now plummeted again. The closing of many of the movement&#x27;s houses around the country, as staff left to join the war effort, showed that Day&#x27;s pacifism had limited appeal even within the Catholic Worker community.

On January 13, 1949, unions representing workers at cemeteries managed by the Archdiocese of New York went on strike. After several weeks, Cardinal Francis Spellman used lay brothers from the local Maryknoll seminary and then diocesan seminarians under his supervision to break the strike by digging graves. He called the union action &quot;Communist-inspired&quot;. Employees of the &quot;Catholic Worker&quot; joined the strikers&#x27; picket line, and Day wrote Spellman, telling him he was &quot;misinformed&quot; about the workers and their demands, defending their right to unionize and their &quot;dignity as men&quot;, which she deemed far more critical than any dispute about wages. She begged him to take the first steps to resolve the conflict: &quot;Go to them, conciliate them. It is easier for the great to give in than the poor.&quot;

Spellman stood fast until the strike ended on March 11, when the union members accepted the Archdiocese&#x27;s original offer of a 48-hour 6-day work week. Day wrote in the &quot;Catholic Worker&quot; in April: &quot;A Cardinal, ill-advised, exercised so overwhelming a show of force against the union of poor working men. There is a temptation of the devil to that most awful of all wars, the war between the clergy and the laity.&quot; Years later, she explained her stance vis-à-vis Spellman: &quot;[H]e is our chief priest and confessor; he is our spiritual leader – of all of us who live here in New York. But he is not our ruler.&quot;

On March 3, 1951, the Archdiocese ordered Day to cease publication or remove the word &quot;Catholic&quot; from her publication name. She replied with a respectful letter that asserted as much right to publish the &quot;Catholic Worker&quot; as the Catholic War Veterans had to their name and their own opinions independent of those of the Archdiocese. The Archdiocese took no action, and later, Day speculated that perhaps church officials did not want members of the Catholic Worker Movement holding prayer vigils for him to relent: &quot;We were ready to go to St. Patrick&#x27;s, fill up the Church, stand outside it in prayerful meditation. We were ready to take advantage of America&#x27;s freedoms so that we could say what we thought and do what we believed to be the right thing to do.&quot;

Her autobiography, &quot;The Long Loneliness&quot;, was published in 1952 with illustrations by the Quaker Fritz Eichenberg. &quot;The New York Times&quot; summarized it a few years later:
On June 15, 1955, Day joined a group of pacifists in refusing to participate in civil defense drills scheduled that day. Some of them challenged the constitutionality of the law under which they were charged, but Day and six others believed that their refusal was not a legal dispute but one of philosophy. Day said she was doing &quot;public penance&quot; for the United States&#x27; first use of an atom bomb. They pleaded guilty on September 28, 1955, but the judge refused to send them to jail, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not making any martyrs.&quot; She did the same in each of the next five years. In 1958, instead of taking shelter, she joined a group picketing the offices of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. After some years, the sentences were suspended; on another occasion, however, she did serve thirty days in jail.

In 1956, along with David Dellinger and A. J. Muste, two veteran allies in the pacifist movement, she helped found &quot;Liberation&quot; magazine.

In 1960, she praised Fidel Castro&#x27;s &quot;promise of social justice&quot;. She said: &quot;Far better to revolt violently than to do nothing about the poor destitute.&quot; Several months later, Day traveled to Cuba and reported her experiences in a four-part series in the &quot;Catholic Worker&quot;. In the first of these, she wrote: &quot;I am most of all interested in the religious life of the people and so must not be on the side of a regime that favors the extirpation of religion. On the other hand, when that regime is bending all its efforts to make a good life for the people, a naturally good life (on which grace can build) one cannot help but be in favor of the measures taken.&quot;

Day hoped that the Second Vatican Council would endorse nonviolence as a fundamental tenet of Catholic life and denounce nuclear arms, both their use in warfare and the &quot;idea of arms being used as deterrents, to establish a balance of terror.&quot; She lobbied bishops in Rome and joined with other women in a ten-day fast. She was pleased when the Council in &quot;Gaudium et spes&quot; (1965), its statement on &quot;the Church in the Modern World&quot;, said that nuclear warfare was incompatible with traditional Catholic just war theory: &quot;Every act of war directed to the indiscriminate destruction of whole cities or vast areas with their inhabitants is a crime against God and man, which merits firm and unequivocal condemnation.&quot;

Day&#x27;s account of the Catholic Worker Movement, &quot;Loaves and Fishes&quot;, was published in 1963.Despite her anti-establishment sympathies, Day&#x27;s judgment of the 60s counterculture was nuanced. She enjoyed it when Abbie Hoffman told her she was the original hippie, accepting it as a form of tribute to her detachment from materialism. Simultaneously, she disapproved of many who called themselves hippies. She described some she encountered in 1969 in Minnesota: &quot;They are marrying young – 17 and 18, and taking to the woods up by the Canadian border and building houses for themselves – becoming pioneers again.&quot; But she recognized in them the self-indulgence of middle-class affluence, people who had &quot;not known suffering&quot; and lived without principles. She imagined how soldiers returning from Vietnam would want to kill them. Still, she thought what the &quot;flower-people&quot; deserved was &quot;prayer and penance&quot;. Day struggled as a leader with influence but without direct authority over the Catholic Worker houses, even the Tivoli Catholic Worker Farm that she visited regularly. She recorded her frustration in her diary: &quot;I have no power to control smoking of pot, for instance, or sexual promiscuity, or solitary sins.&quot;

In 1966, Spellman visited U.S. troops in Vietnam at Christmas, where he was reported as saying: &quot;This war in Vietnam is… a war for civilization.&quot; Day authored a response in the January 1967 issue of the &quot;Catholic Worker&quot; that avoided direct criticism but cataloged all the war zones Spellman had visited over the years: &quot;It is not just Vietnam, it is South Africa, it is Nigeria, the Congo, Indonesia, all of Latin America.&quot; Visiting was &quot;a brave thing to do&quot;, she wrote, and asked: &quot;But oh, God, what are all these Americans doing all over the world so far from our own shores?&quot;

In 1970, at the height of American participation in the Vietnam War, she described Ho Chi Minh as &quot;a man of vision, as a patriot, a rebel against foreign invaders&quot; while telling a story of a holiday gathering with relatives where one needs &quot;to find points of agreement and concordance, if possible, rather than the painful differences, religious and political.&quot;

===Later years===
In 1971, Day was awarded the Pacem in Terris Award of the Interracial Council of the Catholic Diocese of Davenport, Iowa. The University of Notre Dame awarded her its Laetare Medal in 1972. And Franciscan University of Steubenville awarded her, alongside Mother Teresa, its Poverello Medal in 1976.

Despite suffering from poor health, Day visited India, where she met Mother Teresa and saw her work. In 1971, Day visited Poland, the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Romania as part of a group of peace activists, with the financial support of Corliss Lamont, whom she described as a &quot;&#x27;pinko&#x27; millionaire who lived modestly and helped the Communist Party USA.&quot; She met with three members of the Writers&#x27; Union and defended Alexander Solzhenitsyn against charges that he had betrayed his country. Day informed her readers that:

Day visited the Kremlin. She reported: &quot;I was moved to see the names of the Americans, Ruthenberg and Bill Haywood, on the Kremlin Wall in Roman letters, and the name of Jack Reed (with whom I worked on the old &quot;Masses&quot;), in characters in a flower-covered grave.&quot; Ruthenberg was C. E. Ruthenberg, founder of the Communist Party USA. Bill Haywood was a key figure in the IWW. Jack Reed was the journalist better known as John Reed, author of &quot;Ten Days That Shook the World&quot;.

In 1972, the Jesuit magazine &quot;America&quot; marked her 75th birthday by devoting an entire issue to Day and the Catholic Worker Movement. The editors wrote: &quot;By now if one had to choose a single individual to symbolize the best in the aspiration and action of the American Catholic community during the last forty years, that one person would certainly be Dorothy Day.&quot;

Day had supported the work of Cesar Chavez in organizing California farm laborers from the beginning of his campaign in the mid-1960s. She admired him for being motivated by religious inspiration and committed to nonviolence. In the summer of 1973, she joined Chavez in his campaign for farm laborers in the fields of California. She was arrested with other protesters for defying an injunction against picketing and spent ten days in jail.

In 1974, Boston&#x27;s Paulist Center Community named her the first recipient of their Isaac Hecker Award, given to a person or group &quot;committed to building a more just and peaceful world.&quot;

Day made her last public appearance at the Eucharistic Congress held on August 6, 1976, in Philadelphia at a service honoring the U.S. Armed Forces on the United States Bicentennial. She spoke about reconciliation and penance and criticized the organizers for failing to recognize that for peace activists, August 6 is the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, an inappropriate day to honor the military.

===Death===
Day suffered a heart attack and died on November 29, 1980, at Maryhouse, 55 East 3rd Street in Manhattan. Cardinal Terence Cooke greeted her funeral procession at the Church of the Nativity, the local parish church. Day was buried in the Cemetery of the Resurrection on Staten Island just a few blocks from the beachside cottage where she first became interested in Catholicism. Her gravestone is inscribed with the words &quot;Deo gratias&quot;. Day&#x27;s daughter Tamar was with her mother when she died. Tamar and her father joined the funeral procession and attended a later memorial Mass the cardinal celebrated at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. Day and Batterham had remained lifelong friends.

==Beliefs==
===Charity and poverty===
Day struggled to write about poverty most of her life. She admired America&#x27;s efforts to take responsibility through the government, but ultimately felt that charitable works were personal decisions that needed the warmth of an individual.

Day also denounced sins against the poor. She said that &quot;depriving the laborer&quot; was a deadly sin, using similar language to the Epistle of James in the Bible. She also said that advertising men were sinners (&quot;woe to that generation&quot;) because they made the poor &quot;willing to sell [their] liberty and honor&quot; to satisfy &quot;paltry desires&quot;.

===Social Security opposition===
Day was opposed to Social Security. In the &quot;Catholic Worker,&quot; February 1945, she wrote:
===All men are brothers===
In the &quot;Catholic Worker&quot; in May 1951, Day wrote that Marx, Lenin, and Mao Tse-Tung &quot;were animated by the love of brother and this we must believe though their ends meant the seizure of power, and the building of mighty armies, the compulsion of concentration camps, the forced labor and torture and killing of tens of thousands, even millions.&quot; She used them as examples because she insisted that the belief that &quot;all men are brothers&quot; required the Catholic to find the humanity in everyone without exception. She explained that she understood the jarring impact of such an assertion: 
In 1970, Day emulated Maurin when she wrote:
====Sympathy and identification with anarchists====
Day encountered anarchism while studying in the university. She read &quot;The Bomb&quot; by Frank Harris, a fictionalized biography of one of the Haymarket anarchists. She discussed anarchy and extreme poverty with Peter Kropotkin. After moving to New York, Day studied the anarchism of Emma Goldman and attended the Anarchists Ball at Webster Hall. Day was saddened by the executions of the anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti in 1927. She wrote that when they died, &quot;All the nation mourned.&quot; As a Catholic, she felt a sense of solidarity with them, specifically &quot;the very sense of solidarity which made me gradually understand the doctrine of the Mystical Body of Christ whereby we are all members of one another.&quot;

Discussing the term &quot;anarchism&quot;, she wrote: &quot;We ourselves have never hesitated to use the word. Some prefer personalism. But Peter Maurin came to me with Kropotkin in one pocket and St. Francis in the other!&quot; Day&#x27;s anarchist, distributist economic views are similar to the anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon&#x27;s mutualist economic theory, by whom she was influenced. The influence of anarchists, such as Proudhon and Peter Kropotkin, also led her to label herself an anarchist. Dorothy states: &quot;An anarchist then as I am now, I have never used the vote that the women won by their demonstrations before the White House during that period.&quot;

Day explained that anarchists accepted her as someone who shared the values of their movement &quot;because I have been behind bars in police stations, houses of detention, jails and prison farms, ...eleven times, and have refused to pay Federal income taxes and have never voted&quot;, but were puzzled by what they saw as her &quot;faith in the monolithic, authoritarian Church.&quot; She reversed the viewpoint and ignored their professions of atheism. She wrote: &quot;I, in turn, can see Christ in them even though they deny Him because they are giving themselves to working for a better social order for the wretched of the earth.&quot;

====Sympathy with communists====
In the first years of the &quot;Catholic Worker&quot;, Day provided a clear statement of how her individualism contrasted with communism:
 She also stated: &quot;To labor is to pray – that is the central point of the Christian doctrine of work. Hence it is that while both Communism and Christianity are moved by &#x27;compassion for the multitude,&#x27; the object of communism is to make the poor richer, but the object of Christianity is to make the rich poor and the poor holy.&quot;
In November 1949, in the course of explaining why she had protested the recent denial of bail to several Communists, she wrote: &quot;[L]et it be remembered that I speak as an ex-Communist and one who has not testified before Congressional Committees, nor written works on the Communist conspiracy. I can say with warmth that I loved the [communist] people I worked with and learned much from them. They helped me to find God in His poor, in His abandoned ones, as I had not found Him in Christian churches.&quot; She identified points on which she agreed with the communists: &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot; and the &quot;withering away of the State&quot;. Others she added with qualifications: &quot;the communal aspect of property as stressed by the early Christians.&quot; And she identified differences: &quot;we disagree over and over again with the means chosen to reach their ends.&quot; She agreed that &quot;Class war is a fact, and one does not need to advocate it,&quot; but posed the question of how to respond:
Regarding Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba, she wrote in July 1961: &quot;We are on the side of the revolution. We believe there must be new concepts of property, which is proper to man, and that the new concept is not so new. There is a Christian communism and a Christian capitalism. …We believe in farming communes and cooperatives and will be happy to see how they work out in Cuba. …God bless Castro and all those who are seeing Christ in the poor. God bless all those who are seeking the brotherhood of man because in loving their brothers, they love God even though they deny Him.&quot; It was only in December 1961, after the Bay of Pigs Invasion in April of that year, that Castro, who had repeatedly repudiated communism in the past, openly declared that his movement was not simply socialist, but communist.

===Catholic Church property===
Bill Kauffman of &quot;The American Conservative&quot; wrote in 2011 of Day: &quot;She understood that if small is not always beautiful, at least it is always human.&quot;

Day&#x27;s belief in smallness also applied to the property of others, including the Catholic Church, as when she wrote: &quot;Fortunately, the Papal States were wrested from the Church in the last century, but there is still the problem of investment of papal funds. It is always a cheering thought to me that if we have goodwill and are still unable to find remedies for the economic abuses of our time, in our family, our parish, and the mighty church as a whole, God will take matters in hand and do the job for us. When I saw the Garibaldi mountains in British Columbia… I said a prayer for his soul and blessed him for being the instrument of so mighty a work of God. May God use us!&quot;

Jesuit priest Daniel Lyons &quot;called Day &#x27;an apostle of pious oversimplification.&#x27; He said that the &quot;Catholic Worker&quot; &#x27;often distorted beyond recognition&#x27; the position of the Popes&quot;.

===Catholic orthodoxy===
Day wrote in one of her memoirs: &quot;I had a conversation with John Spivak, the Communist writer, a few years ago, and he said to me, &quot;How can you believe? How can you believe in the Immaculate Conception, in the Virgin birth, in the Resurrection?&quot; I could only say that I believe in the Roman Catholic Church and all she teaches. I have accepted Her authority with my whole heart. At the same time, I want to point out to you that we are taught to pray for final perseverance. We are taught that faith is a gift, and sometimes I wonder why some have it, and some do not. I feel my own unworthiness and can never be grateful enough to God for His gift of faith.&quot;

Day&#x27;s commitment to Church discipline is illustrated by an encounter with Fr. Daniel Berrigan, S.J., while on a Catholic Worker farm in New York. Berrigan was about to celebrate Mass for the community vested only in a stole. Day insisted that he put on the proper vestments before he began. When Berrigan complained about the law regarding liturgical vesture, Day responded, &quot;On this farm, we obey the laws of the Church.&quot; He relented and celebrated the Mass fully vested.

===The laity===
In response to press coverage in 1964 of an ongoing dispute between Cardinal James McIntyre of Los Angeles and some of his priests, who criticized him for a lack of leadership on civil rights, Day authored an essay on the laity&#x27;s responsibility to act independently of the church hierarchy. When the &quot;Catholic Worker&quot; during World War II, she wrote, took a pacifist stance, &quot;Bishop McIntyre merely commented… &#x27;We never studied these things much in the seminary&#x27;… adding doubtfully, &#x27;There is the necessity of course to inform one&#x27;s conscience.&#x27;&quot; For that attitude, Day added, &quot;our shepherds are to be reproached, that they have not fed their sheep these strong meats… capable of overcoming all obstacles in their advance to that kind of society where it easier to be good.&quot; She instructed her readers: &quot;Let Catholics form their associations, hold their meetings in their own homes, or in a hired hall, or any place else. Nothing should stop them. Let the controversy come out into the open in this way.&quot;

===Sexual morality===
In September 1963, Day discussed pre-marital sex in her column, warning against those who portrayed it as a form of freedom: &quot;The wisdom of the flesh is treacherous indeed.&quot; She described herself as &quot;a woman who must think in terms of the family, the need of the child to have both mother and father, who believes strongly that the home is the unit of society&quot; and wrote that: 
In 1968, Day wrote again about sex – this time in her diary – in response to the criticisms of Stanley Vishnewski (and other coworkers at the Tivoli farm) that she had &quot;no power&quot; over marijuana smoking &quot;or sexual promiscuity, or solitary sins.&quot; The situation continued to remain a problem, as Day also documented in her diary:
==Contributions to the history of feminism==
===Lifelong devotion to the oppressed===
The beginning of Day&#x27;s career was inherently radical and rooted personalism and socialism; ideologies fundamental to intersectional feminism. Though Day did not explicitly identify as a feminist, this was not unusual for historical contributors to feminist work and philosophy. Much like her gravitation towards Catholicism, Day grew into her feminism; she is a &quot;born again feminist&quot;, like Dolores Huerta. Day&#x27;s lifetime of work, especially with the Catholic Worker Movement, aligns with core feminist principles of pushing against the kyriarchy to fight for rights of the oppressed. Her lifetime solidarity with and advocacy for the disadvantaged and marginalized is fundamentally feminist in its nature; providing aid to impoverished communities, supporting and providing a platform for activists and pacifists in her periodical, The &quot;Catholic Worker&quot;, and working to reform injustices within Catholicism. Day&#x27;s ethos did not change when she was drawn to Catholicism, rather, her devotion to egalitarian Catholic values only propelled her radical feminism, blending her past with her newfound beliefs and values

Day forged a place for feminist theology in a religious world where women&#x27;s experiences were largely not accounted for, or at worst, disregarded as anti-Church by male elites. Day took gendered, raced, classed experiences into account in her writing and work, providing a framework for a construction of religious theory and ethics which was finally both passable and accurate in reflecting the congregation. Through these acts, Day aligns herself and the Catholic Worker Movement with the ideology and practice of feminism. Day lived through several significant events in the history of feminism: women&#x27;s suffrage, labor rights, and movements in the 50s, 60s, and 70s which crusaded for equality, justice, and egalitarianism; all pillars of feminism. In all these things Day never deviated from The Church&#x27;s teachings on the sanctity of human life from conception till natural death.

====Life-inspired works====
Day wrote constantly throughout her life, journalling and writing bits for herself. She published several autobiographical works: &quot;The Eleventh Virgin&quot;, &quot;From Union Square to Rome&quot;, &quot;The Long Loneliness,&quot; and &quot;Loaves and Fishes&quot;. The four volumes together form a lifelong portrayal of Day&#x27;s life. Writing autobiographies, especially about women, can be framed as a feminist act, as it provides direct access to information about prominent figures outside of the academic realm, and allows for greater representation of women in history.

&quot;The Eleventh Virgin&quot;, a coming of age story published in 1924, is autobiographical. Though Day does not directly refer to herself, the protagonist, June, represents Day. June&#x27;s experiences mirror Day&#x27;s youth. The Eleventh Virgin is Day&#x27;s first installment in her series of autobiographical works, but the only that she is reported regretting later in life. The raw portrayal of Day&#x27;s bohemian youth before her conversion to Catholicism did not align with her any longer. The representation of Day&#x27;s early experiences and growth through adolescence, especially at the time of publication, was uncommon. &quot;The Eleventh Virgin&quot; is a feminist text in its narrative and character&#x27;s experiences, and the access it provided.

====Rejection of gender roles====
Day was known for her knack for leveraging and undermining gender norms to fight patriarchal and kyriarchal systems in the workplace, politics, social structures, and the Catholic Church. From a young age, growing up in a family of journalists, Day was made very aware of her perceived limitations as a woman in the world of journalism. Her father played a part in this – speaking to colleagues behind Day&#x27;s back in an effort to prevent them from hiring her. She eventually got her foot in the door as an &quot;office girl&quot;., a position that aligned with both her family and the Church&#x27;s stance on appropriate work for women outside of the home. Day was instructed to &quot;write like a woman&quot;, in a simple, declarative manner, but eventually grew her writing, centring on women&#x27;s and social issues, from both a feminist and personalist perspective. She outright rejected what was currently being published about perceived women&#x27;s issues.As girls do not wear trousers, nor shirts, it is a waste of time and of space to tell them how they can save and still look neat by pressing the trousers under the mattress and sleeping on them, and of turning in the cuffs of their shirt. And, anyway, this is not a column, or part column, to tell girls how to give condescendingly helpful hints on how to save and be content in the hall bedroom. It is merely an experience.Day grew as a writer and a journalist, advancing her career and focusing on the type of journalism she found important, regardless of her gender.I was bent on following the journalist&#x27;s side of the work. I wanted the privileges of the woman and the work of the man without following the work of the woman. I wanted to go on picket lines, to go to jail, to write, to influence others, and so make my mark on the world. How much ambition and how much self-seeking there was in all this!

====Radical Catholicism====
Though Day spent most of her life involved with activism, her radical Catholic social activism is what she is most revered for posthumously. During the Vatican II Council, the most recent Ecumenical council of the Catholic church, Day, along with the Catholic Worker Movement and PAX, traveled to Rome. The plan was to persuade Pope John XXIII and the council to do away with the just war doctrine to support pacifism and conscientious objection in the name of Christian values and explicitly denouncing nuclear weapons.

With the Catholic Worker Movement, Day first focused on labor rights and aiding the disadvantaged, eventually calling for a non-violent revolution against the industrial economy, militarism, and fascism. It was a deep belief of Day&#x27;s that non-violence, pacifism, and anarchism aligned with Christianity would result in a radical shift to a new order. Day&#x27;s fight against the system was noticed by the American government. President Hoover felt particularly threatened, having pushed for Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty to prosecute the Catholic Worker Movement several times for sedition and incitement, despite the Movement&#x27;s pacifist stance. The FBI monitored the Catholic Worker Movement from 1940 to 1970; Day was jailed four times in this period.

Day&#x27;s involvement with the Catholic Worker and commitment to liberation theology fundamentally aligns with the values of feminism: fighting for social and political equality for all people, regardless of race, gender, or class. Her push against the Catholic Church and the military state served to promote egalitarianism and alleviate the oppressed. It is Day&#x27;s commitment to liberation theology. Radical Catholicism contributes to her framing as a feminist and serves to demonstrate the nuance and overlap of both religious and feminist ideologies.

====Social justice====
Throughout her lifetime, Day&#x27;s overarching concern was the expression and effects of the elite, of power, over the people. This concern is shared with both liberation theology and feminist ideology. Day called for a shift to anarchism, communism, and pacifism in the name of Christianity and Christian teachings. Her weapon of choice against oppressive systems was her writing, her voice.Day wrote about vital happenings, matters of life and death, Japanese Chinese war, Ethiopian war, Spanish Civil War, World War II, Korean War, Vietnam war, labor strikes, on streetcars, in garment factories, sugar refineries, and smelting plants, and policies of conscription.Day&#x27;s effort in her writing was to highlight social injustices and serve as a voice for those who could not or did not know how to advocate for themselves, to spark a movement to remedy and protect from further oppression. Her advocacy and charity was prominent during tough times in American history, especially at the beginning of the Catholic Worker Movement during the Great Depression.

==Legacy==
Judith Palache Gregory was Day&#x27;s executor. Day&#x27;s papers are housed at Marquette University, along with many records of the Catholic Worker Movement. Her diaries and letters were edited by Robert Ellsberg and published by Marquette University Press in 2008 and 2010, respectively. A new, 448-page biography appeared in 2020, which was extensively reviewed.

Attempts to preserve the Staten Island beach bungalow at the Spanish Camp community where she lived for the last decade of her life failed in 2001. Developers knocked her home down just as the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission was about to declare it a historic landmark. About a half-dozen large, private homes now occupy the land.

In May 1983, a pastoral letter issued by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, &quot;The Challenge of Peace&quot;, noted her role in establishing non-violence as a Catholic principle: &quot;The nonviolent witness of such figures as Dorothy Day and Martin Luther King has had profound impact upon the life of the Church in the United States.&quot; Pope Benedict XVI, on February 13, 2013, in the closing days of his papacy, cited Day as an example of conversion. He quoted from her writings and said: &quot;The journey towards faith in such a secularized environment was particularly difficult, but Grace acts nonetheless.&quot;

On September 24, 2015, Pope Francis became the first pope to address a joint meeting of the United States Congress. Day was one of four Americans mentioned by the Pope in his speech to the joint session that included Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr., and Thomas Merton. He said of Day: &quot;Her social activism, her passion for justice and for the cause of the oppressed, were inspired by the Gospel, her faith, and the example of the saints.&quot;

===Films===
An independent film about Dorothy Day called &quot;Entertaining Angels: The Dorothy Day Story&quot; was released in 1996. Day was portrayed by Moira Kelly, and Peter Maurin was portrayed by Martin Sheen. A full-length documentary called &quot;Dorothy Day: Don&#x27;t Call Me a Saint&quot; premiered in 2005. It was shown at the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival. &quot;Revolution of the Heart: The Dorothy Day Story&quot;, a film by Martin Doblmeier, aired on PBS in March 2020.

===Music===

A song honoring Dorothy and Peter Maurin (entitled &quot;Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin&quot;), written by the group The Chairman Dances, was premiered by PopMatters in 2016. In late 2021, &quot;America&quot; magazine and &quot;Catholic New York&quot; reported that the song was included in materials sent to the Vatican in consideration of Dorothy&#x27;s canonization.

===Catholic cause for sainthood===
A proposal for Day&#x27;s canonization by the Catholic Church was put forth publicly by the Claretian Missionaries in 1983. At the request of Cardinal John J. O&#x27;Connor, head of the diocese in which she lived, in March 2000 Pope John Paul II granted the Archdiocese of New York permission to open her cause, allowing her to be called a &quot;Servant of God&quot; in the eyes of the Catholic Church. As canon law requires, the Archdiocese of New York submitted this cause for the endorsement of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, which it received in November 2012. In 2015, Pope Francis praised Day before a joint session of the US Congress. 

Currently, Day&#x27;s canonization cause has moved from the diocesan phase to the Roman phase. On December 8, 2021, the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception, the Archdiocese of New York celebrated the conclusion of the diocesan phase of the canonization cause for Dorothy Day. At a Young Adult Mass held at New York City&#x27;s St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan formalized the send-off of the evidence of Dorothy Day&#x27;s holiness, amassed by the Dorothy Day Guild, to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome. The remaining steps include the Vatican reviewing this evidence, passing the case to the pope, and documenting two miracles attributed to Day.

Some members of the Catholic Worker Movement have objected to the canonization process as a contradiction of Day&#x27;s own values and concerns. Others, including Day&#x27;s granddaughter Martha Hennessy, and longtime friend, Kathleen Jordan, are actively working towards her canonization.

<text>Ghetto house or booty house is a subgenre of house music which started being recognized as a distinct style from around 1992 onwards. It features minimal 808 and 909 drum machine-driven tracks and sometimes sexually explicit lyrics.

The template of classic Chicago house music (primarily, &quot;It&#x27;s Time for the Percolator&quot; by Cajmere) was used with the addition of sexual lyrics. It has usually been made on minimal equipment with little or no effects. It usually features either a &quot;4-to-the-floor&quot; kick drum or beat-skipping kick drums such as those found in the subgenre &quot;juke&quot; (full sounding, but not too long or distorted) along with Roland 808 and 909 synthesized tom-tom sounds, minimal use of analogue synths, and short, slightly dirty sounding (both sonically and lyrically) vocals samples, often repeated in various ways. Also common are 808 and 909 clap sounds, and full &quot;rapped&quot; verses and choruses.

Ghetto house music artists include: DJ Deeon, Jammin&#x27; Gerald, DJ Funk, DJ Milton, DJ Slugo, Waxmaster, Traxman, and Parris Mitchell.

==Subgenres==

=== Juke music ===
The late 1990s saw a rise in &quot;juke music&quot; (also known as &quot;juke house&quot; or &quot;Chicago juke&quot;), as a faster variant of ghetto house. Juke songs are generally around 150–165 BPM with kick drums, pounding rapidly (and at times very sparsely) in syncopation with crackling snares, claps, high hats, samples in very short increments and other sounds reminiscent of old drum machines. The production style is often markedly lo-fi, much like baile funk. Juke evolved to match the energy of footwork, a dance style born in the disparate ghettos, house parties and underground dance competitions of Chicago. RP Boo, a former footwork dancer, is generally credited with making the first songs that fall within the canon.

<text>Jonas Malheiro Sidónio Sakaita Savimbi (; 3 August 1934 – 22 February 2002) was an Angolan revolutionary, politician, and rebel military leader who founded and led the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). UNITA was one of several groups which waged a guerrilla war against Portuguese colonial rule from 1966 to 1974. Once independence was achieved, it then became an anti-communist group which confronted the ruling People&#x27;s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) during the Angolan Civil War. Savimbi had extensive contact with anti-communist activists in the United States, including Jack Abramoff and was one of the leading anti-communist voices in the world. Savimbi was killed in a clash with government troops in 2002.

==Early life==

Jonas Malheiro Sidónio Sakaita Savimbi was born in Munhango, Bié Province, a small town on the Benguela Railway, and raised in Chilesso, in the same province. Savimbi&#x27;s father, Lote, was a stationmaster on Angola&#x27;s Benguela railway line and a preacher of the Protestant &quot;Igreja Evangélica Congregacional de Angola&quot; (Evangelical Congregational Church of Angola), founded and maintained by American missionaries. Both his parents were members of the Bieno group of the Ovimbundu, the people who later served as Savimbi&#x27;s major political base.

In his early years, Savimbi was educated mainly in Protestant schools, but also attended Roman Catholic schools. At the age of 24 he received a scholarship to study in Portugal. 

Instead he became associated with students from Angola and other Portuguese colonies who were preparing themselves for anti-colonial resistance and had contacts with the clandestine Portuguese Communist Party. He knew Agostinho Neto, who was at that time studying medicine and who later became president of the MPLA and Angola&#x27;s first state President. Under increasing pressure from the Portuguese secret police (PIDE), Savimbi left Portugal for Switzerland with the assistance of Portuguese and French communists and other sympathizers, and eventually wound up in Lausanne. There he was able to obtain a new scholarship from American missionaries and studied social sciences. He then went to the University of Fribourg for further studies.

While there, probably in August 1960, he met Holden Roberto, who was already a rising star in émigré circles. Roberto was a founding member of the UPA ( União das Populaçoes de Angola) and was already known for his efforts to promote Angolan independence at the United Nations. He tried to recruit Savimbi who seemed to have been undecided whether to commit himself to the cause of Angolan independence at that point in his life.

In late September 1960, Savimbi was asked to give a speech in Kampala, Uganda on behalf of the UDEAN (União Democrática dos Estudantes da Africa Negra), a student organization affiliated with the MPLA. At this meeting he met Tom Mboya who took him to Kenya to see Jomo Kenyatta. They both urged Savimbi to join the UPA. He told French interviewers &quot;J&#x27;ai été convaincu par Kenyatta&quot; (&quot;I was convinced by Kenyatta&quot;). He immediately wrote a letter to Roberto putting himself at his service, which was taken in person to New York by Mboya. Upon his return to Switzerland, Roberto telephoned him. They met in Léopoldville (Kinshasa) in December 1960, and left immediately for the United States. It was the first of many visits.

There are considerable differences in the source material about the date of Savimbi&#x27;s official induction into the UPA. Fred Bridgland, who wrote a much-cited biography of Savimbi, says that Savimbi was &quot;inducted into the UPA&quot; on 1 February 1961. Nonetheless, he may not have officially joined the UPA until late 1961.

It certainly seems that Savimbi was not in the inner circle of UPA activists in early 1961. He took no part in planning the uprising of March 1961, nor did he participate in it.

Savimbi stayed in Léopoldville until the end of March 1961, then went to Switzerland to prepare for examinations. He may have failed, for he abandoned medical studies in Fribourg, and in December 1961 enrolled at Lausanne University in Law and International Politics.

By September 1961, Africans from the Portuguese colonies studying abroad formed the UGEAN (União Geral dos Estudantes da Africa Negra Sob Dominacão Colonial Portuguesa) at a meeting in Rabat, Morocco. Again, this organization was affiliated with the MPLA.

Holden Roberto and the UPA wanted a student organization affiliated with their party. In December 1961, Roberto chaired a meeting at Camp Green Lane near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Savimbi attended this meeting and became one of a number of organizers who created the UNEA, (União Nacional dos Estudantes Angolanos) in March 1962 at Lucerne, Switzerland. Savimbi was elected Secretary-General.

Savimbi participated in UPA activities while continuing to study in Switzerland. He traveled widely on behalf of the organization: to Yugoslavia for the first Non-Aligned Movement Summit in September 1961, with Holden Roberto, and on to New York for the United Nations meeting later that fall.

In a very short time, he was a member of the Executive Committee of the UPA. It was he who encouraged the PDA (Partido Democrático de Angola) to join in a united front with the UPA, creating the FNLA (Frente Nacional de Libertação de Angola) and when these parties formed the GRAE (Govêrno Revolucionário de Angola no Exílio) on April 3, 1962, Savimbi became Foreign Minister of this organization.

In 1993 he fathered Nazar, which was born in Belgium.

==Military career==
Savimbi sought a leadership position in the MPLA by joining the MPLA Youth in the early 1960s. He was rebuffed by the MPLA, and joined forces with the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) in 1964. The same year, he conceived UNITA with Antonio da Costa Fernandes. Savimbi went to China for help and was promised arms and military training. Upon returning to Angola in 1966, he launched UNITA and began his career as an anti-Portuguese guerrilla fighter. He also fought the FNLA and MPLA, as the three resistance movements tried to position themselves to lead a post-colonial Angola. Portugal later released PIDE (Polícia Internacional e de Defesa do Estado, a Portuguese security agency) archives revealing that Savimbi had signed a collaboration pact with Portuguese colonial authorities to fight the MPLA.

Following Angola&#x27;s independence in 1975, Savimbi gradually drew the attention of Chinese and, ultimately, American policymakers and intellectuals. Trained in China during the 1960s, Savimbi was a highly successful guerrilla fighter schooled in classic Maoist approaches to warfare, including baiting his enemies with multiple military fronts, some of which attacked and some of which consciously retreated. Like the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of Mao Zedong, Savimbi mobilized important, although ethnically confined segments of the rural peasantry – overwhelmingly Ovimbundu – as part of his military tactics. From a military strategy standpoint, he can be considered one of the most effective guerrilla leaders of the 20th century.

===Civil war===
As the MPLA was supported by the Soviet bloc since 1974, and declared itself Marxist-Leninist in 1977, Savimbi renounced his earlier Maoist leanings and contacts with China, presenting himself on the international scene as a protagonist of anti-communism. The war between the MPLA and UNITA, whatever its internal reasons and dynamics, thus became part of the Cold War, with both Moscow and Washington viewing the conflict as important to the global balance of power.

====United States support====
In 1985, with the backing of the Reagan administration and through the lobbying efforts of Paul Manafort and his firm Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly which was paid $600,000 each year from Savimbi beginning in 1985, Jack Abramoff and other U.S. conservatives organized the Democratic International in Savimbi&#x27;s base in Jamba, in Cuando Cubango Province in southeastern Angola. Savimbi was strongly supported by the influential, conservative Heritage Foundation. Heritage foreign policy analyst Michael Johns and other conservatives visited regularly with Savimbi in his clandestine camps in Jamba and provided the rebel leader with ongoing political and military guidance in his war against the Angolan government.

Savimbi&#x27;s U.S.-based supporters ultimately proved successful in convincing the Central Intelligence Agency to channel covert weapons and recruit guerrillas for Savimbi&#x27;s war against Angola&#x27;s Marxist government. During a visit to Washington, D.C. in 1986, Reagan invited Savimbi to meet with him at the White House. Following the meeting, Reagan spoke of UNITA winning &quot;a victory that electrifies the world.&quot;

Two years later, with the Angolan Civil War intensifying, Savimbi returned to Washington, where he praised the Heritage Foundation&#x27;s work on UNITA&#x27;s behalf.

====Military and political efforts====

Complementing his military skills, Savimbi also impressed many with his intellectual qualities. He spoke seven languages fluently including Portuguese, French, and English. In visits to foreign diplomats and in speeches before American audiences, he often cited classical Western political and social philosophy, ultimately becoming one of the most vocal anti-communists of the Third World.

Savimbi&#x27;s biography describes him as &quot;an incredible linguist. He spoke four European languages, including English although he had never lived in an English-speaking country. He was extremely well read. He was an extremely fine conversationalist and a very good listener.&quot; Savimbi also accused his political opponents of witchcraft. These contrasting images of Savimbi would play out throughout his life, with his enemies calling him a power-hungry warmonger, and his American and other allies calling him a critical figure in the West&#x27;s bid to win the Cold War.

As U.S. support began to flow liberally and leading U.S. conservatives championed his cause, Savimbi won major strategic advantages in the late 1980s, and again in the early 1990s, after having taken part unsuccessfully in the general elections of 1992. As a consequence, Moscow and Havana began to reevaluate their engagement in Angola, as Soviet and Cuban fatalities mounted and Savimbi&#x27;s ground control increased.

By 1989, UNITA held total control of several limited areas, but was able to develop significant guerrilla operations everywhere in Angola, with the exception of the coastal cities and Namibe Province. At the height of his military success, in 1989 and 1990, Savimbi was beginning to launch attacks on government and military targets in and around the country&#x27;s capital, Luanda. Observers felt that the strategic balance in Angola had shifted and that Savimbi was positioning UNITA for a possible military victory.

Signaling the concern that the Soviet Union was placing on Savimbi&#x27;s advance in Angola, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev raised the Angolan war with Reagan during numerous U.S.-Soviet summits. In addition to meeting with Reagan, Savimbi also met with Reagan&#x27;s successor, George H. W. Bush, who promised Savimbi &quot;all appropriate and effective assistance.&quot;

===1990s===
 In January 1990 and again in February 1990, Savimbi was wounded in armed conflict with Angolan government troops. The injuries did not prevent him from again returning to Washington, where he met with his American supporters and President Bush in an effort to further increase US military assistance to UNITA. Savimbi&#x27;s supporters warned that continued Soviet support for the MPLA was threatening broader global collaboration between Gorbachev and the US.

In February 1992, Antonio da Costa Fernandes and Nzau Puna defected from UNITA, declaring publicly that Savimbi was not interested in a political test, but on preparing another war. Under military pressure from UNITA, the Angolan government negotiated a cease-fire with Savimbi, and Savimbi ran for president in the national elections of 1992. Foreign monitors claimed the election to be fair. But because neither Savimbi (40 percent) nor Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos (49%) obtained the 50 percent necessary to prevail, a run-off election was scheduled.

In late October 1992, Savimbi dispatched UNITA Vice President Jeremias Chitunda and UNITA senior advisor Elias Salupeto Pena to Luanda to negotiate the details of the run-off election. On 2 November 1992 in Luanda, Chitunda and Pena&#x27;s convoy was attacked by government forces and they were both pulled from their car and shot dead. Their bodies were taken by government authorities and never seen again. The MPLA offensive against UNITA and the FNLA has come to be known as the Halloween Massacre where over 10,000 of their voters were massacred nationwide by MPLA forces. Alleging governmental electoral fraud and questioning the government&#x27;s commitment to peace, Savimbi withdrew from the run-off election and resumed fighting, mostly with foreign funds. UNITA again quickly advanced militarily, encircling the nation&#x27;s capital of Luanda.

In 1994, UNITA signed a new peace accord. Savimbi declined the vice-presidency that was offered to him and again renewed fighting in 1998.

Savimbi reportedly purged those within UNITA whom he saw as threats to his leadership or as questioning his strategic course. According to Fred Bridgland, Savimbi&#x27;s foreign secretary Tito Chingunji and much of his family, possibly numbering more than 60, were murdered in 1991 after Savimbi suspected that Chingunji had been in secret, unapproved negotiations with the Angolan government during Chingunji&#x27;s various diplomatic assignments in Europe and the United States. Savimbi denied his involvement in the Chingunji killing and blamed it on UNITA dissidents. According to Bridgland in his book &quot;The War for Africa: Twelve Months that Transformed a Continent&quot;, in an earlier incident termed &#x27;Red September&#x27;, Savimbi oversaw the torture and killing of dozens of people, including many of his own officers, their wives and children, in a witchcraft ritual. Bridgland also stated that Aurora Katalayo (widow of UNITA leader Mateus Katalayo, whom Savimbi had allegedly killed a few years earlier) and her four-year old son were burned alive, accused of witchcraft. In May 1992, the high-ranking UNITA members Tony da Costa Fernandes and Miguel N&#x27;Zau Puna left the rebel group, stating that at least five people had been executed on Savimbi&#x27;s orders in August 1991. These included Chingunji, his brother-in-law, his sister and the latter&#x27;s two children (aged 6 and 13).

==Death==
After surviving more than six assassination attempts, and having been reported dead at least 17 times, Savimbi was killed on 22 February 2002, in a battle with Angolan government troops along riverbanks in the province of Moxico, his birthplace. In the firefight, Savimbi sustained 15 gunshot wounds to his head, throat, upper body and legs. While Savimbi returned fire, his wounds proved fatal; he died almost instantly.

Savimbi&#x27;s somewhat mystical reputation for eluding the Angolan military and their Soviet and Cuban military advisors led many Angolans to question the validity of reports of his 2002 death in combat until pictures of his bloodied and bullet-riddled body appeared on Angolan state television, and the United States State Department subsequently confirmed it. He was interred in Luena Main Cemetery in Luena, Moxico Province. On 3 January 2008, his tomb was vandalised and four members of the youth wing of the MPLA were charged and arrested. His body was exhumed and reburied publicly in 2019.

===Legacy===
Savimbi was succeeded by António Dembo, who assumed UNITA&#x27;s leadership on an interim basis in February 2002. But Dembo had sustained wounds in the same attack that killed Savimbi, and he died from them three days later and was succeeded by Paulo Lukamba Gato. Six weeks after Savimbi&#x27;s death, a ceasefire between UNITA and the MPLA was signed, but Angola remains deeply divided politically between MPLA and UNITA supporters. A parliamentary election in September 2008 resulted in an overwhelming majority for the MPLA, but its legitimacy was questioned by international observers.

In the years since Savimbi&#x27;s death, his legacy has been a source of debate. &quot;The mistake that Savimbi made, the historical, big mistake he made, was to reject (the election) and go back to war&quot;, Alex Vines, head of the Africa program at London-based Chatham House research institute said in February 2012. Africa expert Paula Roque, of the University of Oxford, says Savimbi was &quot;a very charismatic man, a man who exuded power and leadership. We can&#x27;t forget that for a large segment of the population, UNITA represented something.&quot;

He was survived by &quot;several wives and dozens of children&quot;, the latter numbering at least 25.

==In popular culture==
Savimbi is a minor character in &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops II&quot;, a video game that was released in 2012. Savimbi is voiced by Robert Wisdom. Three of Savimbi’s children took issue with Savimbi&#x27;s representation in the game, claiming that he was portrayed as a &quot;big halfwit who wanted to kill everybody&quot;. However, Activision, the publishers of &quot;Black Ops II&quot;, argued that the game portrayed him as a &quot;political leader and strategist&quot;. The lawsuit was rejected by a French court.

<doc id="264103" wikidata="Q698416" url="?curid=264103" title="The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun">
<text>is a 1968 Japanese anime fantasy adventure film. It is the directorial feature film debut of Isao Takahata and was also worked on by Hayao Miyazaki. &quot;Horus&quot; marked the beginning of their partnership that would last for the next 50 years across numerous animation studios.

The core production team for &quot;Horus, Prince of the Sun&quot; included Takahata (Director), Yasuo Otsuka (Animation Director), Miyazaki (Scene Design, Key Animation), Yasuji Mori (Key Animation), Reiko Okuyama (Key Animation), and Yoichi Kotabe (Key Animation). This group contributed to designs, story ideas and storyboards; all but Takahata (who is not an animator) contributed to character designs. Akemi Ota, Masatake Kita, and Sadao Kikuchi were the remaining Key Animators, but did not contribute many ideas to the film.

The movie was released straight to television in the United States by AIP-TV under the title The Little Norse Prince.

==Synopsis==
Set in an unspecified northern kingdom in ancient Norway, the film opens with the young Horus (aka Hols,) attempting to fight off a pack of &quot;silver wolves,&quot; and accidentally waking up an ancient stone giant, named Mogue (or Rockoar in some editions of the film). Horus succeeds in pulling a splinter from the giant&#x27;s shoulder, which transpires to be a rusty and ancient sword. The giant proclaims this to be the &quot;Sword of the Sun,&quot; promising also that when the sword has been reforged, he will come to Horus, who will then be called &quot;Prince of the Sun&quot;.

Horus&#x27; father, on his deathbed, reveals that their family came from a northern seaside village, which was devastated by the terrifying ice devil Grunwald, leaving them the only survivors. Before dying, Horus&#x27; father urges his son to return to the land of his birth and avenge the village.

On his journey, Horus and his companion, a bear named Koro, are soon confronted by Grunwald, who plunges the boy from a cliff when Horus refuses to serve him. Horus survives the fall and is rescued by the inhabitants of a nearby village. Horus soon becomes a heroic figure when he kills an enormous pike which had been threatening the lives and livelihoods of this fishing community.

The pike was a ploy of Grunwald&#x27;s, who then sends the silver wolves to attack the village instead. In the battle that follows, Horus and Koro chase the wolves to a deserted village, where he meets a mysterious young girl named Hilda. Horus takes Hilda back to his village, where her beautiful singing is welcomed by the villagers, with the exception of the chief, who is increasingly resentful of Horus&#x27; popularity, and his deputy, Drago. Hilda, who is actually Grunwald&#x27;s sister and under his evil influence, later collaborates with Drago and sends a swarm of rats to attack the village (in the original Japanese version, Grunwald wanted Horus to be his brother before he plunged Horus down the cliff; this ties in with Horus&#x27; first encounter with Hilda and her comment on how they both share the same fate that they&#x27;re like twins). Drago frames Horus for his own failed attempt to assassinate the chief, and the villagers banish Horus.

Horus sets out in search of Grunwald, but is confronted by Hilda, and the owl who acts as a messenger between Hilda and Grunwald. With her true identity revealed, Hilda reluctantly attacks Horus, who falls into a chasm and becomes trapped in an enchanted wood, where he is haunted by visions of the villagers and his father. Grunwald then sends Hilda, against her wishes, to kill Horus, and makes his own attack on the village, together with his wolves and a giant ice mammoth.

Horus is able to escape from the enchanted forest when he realizes that the sword must be reforged as a collective effort and that the villagers must unite in order to defeat Grunwald. After a brief fight with Hilda, who is thoroughly remorseful about her involvement in Grunwald&#x27;s plan, Horus rejoins the villagers in their battle and uses the raging fires they ignited in their defense to reforge the sword. With the &quot;Sword of the Sun&quot; reforged, he is soon joined by the stone giant Mogue. Together they defeat and destroy Grunwald. Hilda, who had given her magical &quot;Medal of Life&quot; to aid Horus, finds that she is still alive without it, and rejoins Horus and the villagers.

==Production==
The story of &quot;Horus&quot; is based on the puppet play &quot;&quot;, created by screenwriter , which in turn is a reinterpretation of an epic from Yukar, the oral tradition of the Ainu people, the indigenous people of the island of Hokkaido. The Japanese language title of the originally Ainu epic is . For &quot;Horus&quot; the setting was changed to Scandinavia to avoid any controversy due to depiction of the Ainu people. The story was also inspired by the intention to address an adult audience, to reflect societal changes in contemporary Japan and to portray the socialist ideals in the portrayed village community, where the protagonists not only improve their own lot in a coming of age story but where their personal growth benefits society at large as well. The film shows a place where the people are able to shake off oppressive forces and derive pleasure from their communal efforts such as subsistence fishing.

Production on &quot;Horus&quot; started in autumn 1965 and lasted until March 1968. The production was lengthy compared to other feature-length animated films at Toei, which were made in approximately 8–10 months. The focus at the company was also shifting towards production of television animation. Director Takahata and animation director Ōtsuka approached the process in an egalitarian manner and invited input from the entire team for storyboard and planning meetings, a method which opened the door for Miyazaki to contribute significantly to the development of the story and animation.

With a production budget of over or , &quot;Horus&quot; was the most expensive anime film up until it was surpassed by &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot; (1977).

==Reception==
As quoted in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Japanese Pop Culture&quot; by Mark Schilling, a reviewer for Hakubunkan&#x27;s monthly magazine commented, in 1968, &quot;In one corner of the world there now exists a commercial animation that has surpassed Disney and started to make rapid advances&quot;, after seeing &quot;Horus&quot; and &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;.

Helen McCarthy, in her book &quot;Hayao Miyazaki; Master of Japanese Animation&quot;, notes that the film had only a brief theatrical release despite its critical and popular success. McCarthy notes that Yasuji Mori&#x27;s &quot;clean and simple character design&quot; for &quot;Hilda&quot; &quot;allowed for considerable emotional depth and flexibility&quot; and she observed that this style remained a powerful influence on the works of Takahata and Miyazaki throughout their animation careers.

In 2001, the Japanese magazine &quot;Animage&quot; elected &quot;Horus, Prince of the Sun&quot; the third best anime production of all time.

In his book &quot;Anime Explosion&quot;, Patrick Drazen mentions the film as a pivotal work in the evolution of animation and writes that the 10-day theatrical showing was either a sign that Toei studio executives were unable to recognise quality or a ploy to get back at Union organizers like Miyazaki and Takahata, who didn&#x27;t direct for the company again. Drazen notes that the ending scenes in the film were thinly disguised rallying cries for the union and student movements of the time, by whom the film was well received. Drazen also praised the depiction of Hilda as a conflicted heroine, writing that the character comes across as complex, working sometimes for good and sometimes for evil, and can be seen as the first in a long line of multidimensional heroines in Takahata&#x27;s and Miyazaki&#x27;s later works.

The influence on Japanese cel animation of Ōtsuka&#x27;s approach for &quot;Horus&quot; has been singled out. Thomas Lamarre writes, in &quot;The Anime Machine&quot;, that understanding Yasuo Ōtsuka&#x27;s style is especially important for an understanding of Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s work. The sequence in which Horus fights the giant fish in particular has been referenced as a pivotal moment in the evolution of the medium and as a scene which had a profound impact on the animation works later produced at Studio Ghibli.

Justin Sevakis, writing a retrospective review for Anime News Network in March 2014, noted that the film was a financial flop but almost immediately gained a following among young people. Sevakis opined that despite its flaws, &quot;Horus&quot; is one of the few animated stories from the period that can still be recommended to an adult audience.

In 2017, Mike Toole of Anime News Network placed the film first on his 100 Best Anime Movies of All Time list.

==Home video==
In 2005, Optimum Releasing released the film as &quot;The Little Norse Prince&quot; on DVD for the UK and Ireland, under its Optimum Asia label. The DVD includes English-language subtitles but no extra features other than the 1968 Japanese trailer, and is locked to region 2. The subtitles were criticized for being incomplete, often skipping dialog and completely omitting the songs, but they do refer to the title character as &quot;Hols&quot;, and the video presentation was criticized for the presence of ghosting artefacts as a result of being converted from 60 Hz to 50 Hz for compatibility with European TVs and players. However, this release was the first time that the film had ever been widely available with its original audio and English subtitles at all, and was for almost a decade the only way of viewing the film as such. This release is currently out of print.

In 2013, the film was released in Japan on Blu-ray Disc by Toei. The version of the film on this release, however, was discovered to be not sourced from a new, high-definition restoration but upscaled from the existing, standard-definition transfer that dates back to the film&#x27;s release on LaserDisc by CAV and which was the source of Toei&#x27;s and all other existing releases of the film on DVD. No English language subtitles are present on this release.

On December 23, 2014, Discotek Media released the film as &quot;Horus, Prince of the Sun&quot; on DVD for Northern America. This release features a new English-language subtitle translation (which is more complete and more accurate than the subtitles on the Optimum release, except that they refer to the title character as &quot;Horus&quot;), two audio commentaries, video interviews with Isao Takahata and Yoichi Kotabe, four written essays, production galleries, and the 1968 trailer with new subtitles. It is stated to be locked to region 1 on its packaging and Discotek&#x27;s website, but was discovered to be compatible with all regions. This is the first U.S. release of the movie in its original Japanese version, and the first release of its English dub on disc. Unlike the Optimum DVD release, it has not been converted to 50 Hz, so does not suffer from ghosting.

On January 21, 2015, the upscaled Blu-ray Disc edition of the movie was included in Walt Disney Studios Japan&#x27;s &quot;The Complete Works of Isao Takahata&quot; boxset, which contains ten of the director&#x27;s films. This version is identical to Toei&#x27;s standalone BD release.

On March 28, 2017, Discotek Media released the film as &quot;Horus, Prince of the Sun&quot; on Blu-ray Disc for Northern America. This release includes the original Japanese audio and the AIP English dub as well as commentaries, interviews and trailers and is locked to region A.

The AIP library was eventually purchased by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which had aired the film as &quot;Little Norse Prince&quot; on U.S. television. MGM licensed out the uncut English dub made for &quot;Little Norse Prince&quot; as an audio option on the Discotek Media DVD and BD releases, and the AIP version has been available on many video streaming websites in Northern America including Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon Video as of 2015.

<doc id="264104" wikidata="Q2317656" url="?curid=264104" title="The Haunted Mask">
<text>The Haunted Mask is the eleventh book in the original &quot;Goosebumps&quot;, the series of children&#x27;s horror fiction novels created and written by R. L. Stine. The book follows Carly Beth, a girl who buys a Halloween mask from a store. After putting on the mask, she starts acting differently and discovers that the mask has become her face; she is unable to pull the mask off. R. L. Stine says he got the idea for the book from his son who had put on a Frankenstein mask he had trouble getting off.

&quot;The Haunted Mask&quot; was featured on the &quot;USA Today&quot; and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; bestseller list, and cited by one reviewer as &quot;ideal for reluctant readers and Halloween-themed sleepovers.&quot; In the mid-1990s, the book was adapted for television and released on VHS on March 12, 1996. &quot;The Haunted Mask&quot; has three published sequels: &quot;The Haunted Mask II&quot;, &quot;The Scream of the Haunted Mask&quot; and a stand-alone story, &quot;Wanted: The Haunted Mask&quot;.

==Background==
&quot;The Haunted Mask&quot; was written by R. L. Stine and originally illustrated by Tim Jacobus. The author says the idea for the book came from his son Matthew Stine, who put on a Frankenstein mask that he had trouble getting off during Halloween. Stine also says that he incorporated a duck costume his parents got him for trick-or-treating in the book. Tim Jacobus&#x27;s niece was the model for the cover of the book.

The book was first published in September 1993 by Scholastic, and reissued in 2003 and on September 1, 2008. An audiobook, narrated by Jorjeana Marie, was published in 2015 by Scholastic Audio.

==Plot==
Carly Beth Caldwell is a naive, timid and gullible 11-year-old girl who scares easily. Thus, she is constantly ridiculed by Steve Boswell and Chuck Greene at Walnut Avenue Middle School. The pair play several tricks on her, such as offering a sandwich containing a live worm. After school, she goes home and finds her mother has made her a plaster of Carly Beth&#x27;s face as a symbol of love. When she goes to her room, her younger brother Noah scares her in a duck costume also made by their mother. At the school science fair, Steve causes a panic by announcing his pet tarantula has escaped, and exploits Carly Beth&#x27;s arachnophobia by pinching her leg, leading her to believe that the tarantula has bitten her. She flies into a frenzied and destructive panic and is once again humiliated in front of her teachers and classmates. Carly Beth exasperatedly vents to her friend Sabrina and promises vengeance upon Steve and Chuck. She plots to go to a new shop that has opened, which sells frightening costumes, and plans to scare Steve and Chuck as payback.

Within the shop, Carly Beth sneaks into a back room and discovers a row of hideously deformed masks. The store owner reluctantly sells her one of the masks and Carly Beth goes home in delight. After successfully scaring Noah with the mask, she dons it again on Halloween evening and manages to scare Chuck and Steve. However, as the night goes on, her voice deepens and her behavior becomes violent; she strangles Sabrina and frightens children she does not know. Carly Beth later discovers that she is unable to remove the mask and realizes to her horror that the mask has become one with her skin.

Carly Beth returns to the shop, where the shopkeeper tells her that the &quot;masks&quot; in the back room are actually living faces that can only be removed by a &quot;symbol of love&quot;, but if it attaches itself to her or another person again, the fusion will be permanent. The other masks suddenly come to life and begin to pursue Carly Beth. While running away from the masks, she realizes that the plaster mold her mother made is a symbol of love. Carly Beth finds the mold and uses it to deter the masks and remove the mask from her face. She returns home to her mother, tossing the mask away. Noah later bursts in and asks her, &quot;How do I look in your mask?&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;The Haunted Mask&quot; was featured on &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Top 150 Best-Selling Books database for 43 weeks, attaining a peak position of 107. In 2001, it was listed as the 249th bestselling children&#x27;s paperback book of all time by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, having sold 1.42 million copies.

Terreece Clarke from Common Sense Media rated the book three stars out of five, commenting that it &quot;is ideal for reluctant readers and Halloween-themed sleepovers&quot; and &quot;is one of the better books in the &quot;Goosebumps&quot; series&quot;. &quot;Flavorwire&quot;″s Kevin Pires listed the book as one of his ten favorite &quot;Goosebumps&quot; books, stating &quot;Tim Jacobus&#x27; [...] gripping illustration and Stine&#x27;s straightforward plot made &quot;The Haunted Mask&quot; an emblem for the series.&quot; Nathan Reese and Brooke Marine from Complex.com ranked it as the best &quot;Goosebumps&quot; book, stating the book was very thrilling, and the twist ending caused the right amount of horror. Writer and librarian Herbert N. Foerstel stated it was &quot;perhaps the most famous &quot;Goosebumps&quot; book&quot;.

== Television adaptation and VHS release ==

Filming for &quot;The Haunted Mask&quot; episode began in 1995 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The episode first aired on October 27, 1995, on the Fox Network as the series premiere of the &quot;Goosebumps&quot; TV series. In the United States, &quot;The Haunted Mask&quot; was viewed by approximately 7.9 million households. In Canada, the episode aired on YTV and became the network&#x27;s highest rated episode up to that point, with nearly three million viewers.

It was subsequently released on VHS on March 12, 1996. The video was listed 75th in &quot;Billboard&quot;″s list of Top Video Sales for 1996, the only &quot;Goosebumps&quot; video on the list. Frazier Tharpe, Brendan Klinkenberg, and Khal from Complex.com named it the 10th best Halloween themed TV episode and called it one of the scariest &quot;Goosebumps&quot; episodes. Michelle Erica Green from FamilyWonder.com felt that it had genuinely scary and exciting scenes, but thought it had stereotypical characters, a corny feel-good message, and special effects which weakened its impact. In 1997, Kathryn Long, who played Carly Beth, received a Gemini Award nomination for &quot;Best Performance in a Children&#x27;s or Youth Program or Series&quot;.

==Sequels==
Three sequels of the book were published, &quot;The Haunted Mask II&quot; in October 1995 (the thirty-sixth book in the &quot;Goosebumps&quot; series), &quot;The Scream of the Haunted Mask&quot; on August 1, 2008 (the fourth book in the &quot;Goosebumps HorrorLand&quot; series) and a stand-alone story on July 1, 2012, &quot;Wanted: The Haunted Mask&quot;. &quot;Wanted: The Haunted Mask&quot; was published as a celebration of the 20th anniversary of &quot;Goosebumps&quot;. Another book, &quot;The Haunted Mask Lives!&quot;, was listed on illustrator Tim Jacobus&#x27;s website, but was not released.

<doc id="264105" wikidata="Q184163" url="?curid=264105" title="Colchester">
<text>Colchester ( ) is a city in northeastern Essex, England. It is the second-largest settlement in the county, with a population of 130,245 at the 2021 Census. The demonym is &quot;Colcestrian&quot;.
Colchester occupies the site of Camulodunum, the first major city in Roman Britain and its first capital. Colchester therefore claims to be Britain&#x27;s first city. It has been an important military base since the Roman era, with Colchester Garrison currently housing the 16th Air Assault Brigade.

On the River Colne, Colchester is northeast of London. It is connected to London by the A12 road and the Great Eastern Main Line railway. Colchester is less than from London Stansted Airport and from the port of Harwich.

Attractions in and around the city include St Botolph&#x27;s Priory, Colchester Zoo, and several art galleries. Colchester Castle was constructed in the eleventh century on earlier Roman foundations; it now contains a museum. The main campus of the University of Essex is located between Colchester and Wivenhoe. Local government is the responsibility of the City of Colchester and Essex County Council.

==Name==
There are several theories about the origin of the name &quot;Colchester&quot;. Some contend that is derived from the Latin words &quot;colonia&quot; (referring to a type of Roman settlement with rights equivalent to those of Roman citizens, one of which was believed to have been founded in the vicinity of Colchester) and &quot;castra&quot;, meaning &quot;fortifications&quot; (referring to the city walls, the oldest in Britain). The earliest forms of the name Colchester are &quot;Colenceaster&quot; and &quot;Colneceastre&quot; from the 10th century, with the modern spelling of &quot;Colchester&quot; being found in the 15th century. In this way of interpreting the name, the River Colne which runs through the area takes its name from &quot;Colonia&quot; as well. Cologne (German &quot;Köln&quot;) also gained its name from a similar etymology (from its Roman name Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium).

Other etymologists are confident that the Colne&#x27;s name is pre-Roman, sharing its origin with several other rivers Colne or Clun around Britain, and that Colchester is derived from &quot;Colne&quot; and &quot;Castra&quot;. Ekwall went as far as to say &quot;it has often been held that Colchester contains as first element [Latin] &quot;colonia&quot; ... this derivation is ruled out of court by the fact that Colne is the name of several old villages situated a good many miles from Colchester and on the Colne. The identification of Colonia with Colchester is doubtful.&quot;

The popular association of the name with King Coel has no academic merit.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The gravel hill upon which Colchester is built was formed in the Middle Pleistocene period, and was shaped into a terrace between the Anglian glaciation and the Ipswichian glaciation by an ancient precursor to the River Colne. From these deposits Palaeolithic flint tools, including at least six Acheulian handaxes, have been found. Further flint tools made by hunter gatherers living in the Colne Valley during the Mesolithic have been discovered, including a tranchet axe from Middlewick. In the 1980s an archaeological inventory showed that over 800 shards of pottery from the Neolithic, Bronze Age and early Iron Age have been found within Colchester, along with many examples of worked flint. This included a pit found at Culver Street containing a ritually placed Neolithic grooved ware pot, as well as find spots containing later Deverel-Rimbury bucket urns. Colchester is surrounded by Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments that pre-date the town, including a Neolithic henge at Tendring, large Bronze Age barrow cemeteries at Dedham and Langham, and a larger example at Brightlingsea consisting of a cluster of 22 barrows.

===Celtic origins===

Colchester is said to be the oldest recorded town in Britain on the grounds that it was mentioned by Pliny the Elder, who died in AD 79, although the Celtic name of the town, &quot;Camulodunon&quot; appears on coins minted by tribal chieftain Tasciovanus in the period 2010 BC. Before the Roman conquest of Britain it was already a centre of power for Cunobelin known to Shakespeare as Cymbeline king of the Catuvellauni (c. 5 BCAD 40), who minted coins there. Its Celtic name, Camulodunon, variously represented as CA, CAM, CAMV, CAMVL and CAMVLODVNO on the coins of Cunobelinus, means &#x27;the fortress of [the war god] Camulos&#x27;. During the 30s AD Camulodunon controlled a large swathe of Southern and Eastern Britain, with Cunobelin called &quot;King of the Britons&quot; by Roman writers. Camulodunon is sometimes popularly considered one of many possible sites around Britain for the legendary (perhaps mythical) Camelot of King Arthur, though the name &quot;Camelot&quot; (first mentioned by the 12th century French Arthurian storyteller Chrétien de Troyes) is most likely a corruption of &quot;Camlann&quot;, a now unknown location first mentioned in the 10th century Welsh annalistic text Annales Cambriae, identified as the place where Arthur was slain in battle.

===Roman period===

Soon after the Roman conquest of Britain in AD 43, a Roman legionary fortress was established, the first in Britain. Later, when the Roman frontier moved outwards and the twentieth legion had moved to the west (c. AD 49), Camulodunum became a colonia named in a second-century inscription as &quot;Colonia Victricensis&quot;. This contained a large and elaborate Temple to the Divine Claudius, the largest classical-style temple in Britain, as well as at least seven other Romano-British temples. Colchester is home to two of the five Roman theatres found in Britain; the example at Gosbecks (site of the Iron Age royal farmstead) is the largest in Britain, able to seat 5,000.

Camulodunum served as a provincial Roman capital of Britain, but was attacked and destroyed during Boudica&#x27;s rebellion in AD 61. Sometime after the destruction, London became the capital of the province of Britannia. Colchester&#x27;s city walls c. 3,000 yd. long were built c.65–80 A.D. when the Roman town was rebuilt after the Boudicca rebellion. In 2004, Colchester Archaeological Trust discovered the remains of a Roman Circus (chariot race track) underneath the Garrison in Colchester, a unique find in Britain. The city reached its peak in the second and third centuries AD. It may have reached a population of 30,000 in that period.

In 2014 a hoard of jewellery, known as The Fenwick Hoard, named for the shop it was found beneath, was discovered in the town centre. The director of Colchester Archaeological Trust, Philip Crummy, described the hoard as being of &quot;national importance and one of the finest ever uncovered in Britain&quot;.

===Sub-Roman and Saxon period===

There is evidence of hasty re-organisation of Colchester&#x27;s defences around 268–82 AD, followed later, during the fourth century, by the blocking of the Balkerne Gate. John Morris suggested that the name Camelot of Arthurian legend was probably a reference to Camulodunum, the capital of Britannia in Roman times.

The archaeologist Sir Mortimer Wheeler was the first to propose that the lack of early Anglo-Saxon finds in a triangle between London, Colchester and St Albans could indicate a &#x27;sub-Roman triangle&#x27; where British rule continued after the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons. Since then excavations have revealed some early Saxon occupation, including a fifth-century wooden hut built on the ruins of a Roman house in present-day Lion Walk. Archaeological excavations have shown that public buildings were abandoned, and is very doubtful whether Colchester survived as a settlement with any urban characteristics after the sixth century.

The chronology of its revival is obscure. But the ninth-century &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, attributed to Nennius, mentions the town, which it calls &quot;Cair Colun&quot;, in a list of the thirty most important cities in Britain. Colchester was in the area assigned to the Danelaw in c.880, and remained in Danish hands until 917 when it was besieged and recaptured by the army of Edward the Elder. The tenth-century Saxons called the town &quot;Colneceastre&quot;, which is directly equivalent to the &quot;Cair Colun&quot; of &#x27;Nennius&#x27;. The tower of Holy Trinity Church is late Saxon work.

===Medieval and Tudor periods===

Medieval Colchester&#x27;s main landmark is Colchester Castle, which is an 11th-century Norman keep, and built on top of the vaults of the old Roman temple. There are notable medieval ruins in Colchester, including the surviving gateway of the Benedictine abbey of St John the Baptist (known locally as &quot;St John&#x27;s Abbey&quot;), and the ruins of the Augustinian priory of St Botolph (known locally as &quot;St Botolph&#x27;s Priory&quot;). Many of Colchester&#x27;s parish churches date from this period.

Colchester&#x27;s medieval town seal incorporated the biblical text &quot;Intravit ihc: in quoddam castellum et mulier quedam excepit illum&quot; &#x27;Jesus entered a certain castle and a woman there welcomed him&#x27; (Luke 10.38). This is a commonplace allegory in which a castle is likened to Mary&#x27;s womb, and explains the name of Maidenburgh St, neighbouring the castle.

In 1189, Colchester was granted its first known royal charter by King Richard I (Richard the Lionheart), although the wording suggests that it was based on an earlier one. It granted Colchester&#x27;s burgesses the right to elect bailiffs and a justice. The borough celebrated the 800th anniversary of its charter in 1989.

Colchester developed rapidly during the later 14th century as a centre of the woollen cloth industry, and became famous in many parts of Europe for its russets (fabrics of a grey-brown colour). This allowed the population to recover exceptionally rapidly from the effects of the Black Death, particularly by immigration into the town.
Rovers Tye Farm, now a pub on Ipswich Road, has been documented as being established by 1353.
By the &#x27;New Constitutions&#x27; of 1372, a borough council was instituted; the two bailiffs who represented the borough to the king were now expected to consult sixteen ordinary councillors and eight auditors (later called aldermen). Even though Colchester&#x27;s fortunes were more mixed during the 15th century, it was still a more important place by the 16th century than it had been in the 13th. In 1334 it would not have ranked among England&#x27;s wealthiest fifty towns, to judge from the taxation levied that year. By 1524, however, it ranked twelfth, as measured by its assessment to a lay subsidy.
Between 1550 and 1600, a large number of weavers and clothmakers from Flanders emigrated to Colchester and the surrounding areas. They were famed for the production of &quot;Bays and Says&quot; cloths which were woven from wool and are normally associated with baize and serge although surviving examples show that they were rather different from their modern equivalents. An area in Colchester town centre is still known as the Dutch Quarter and many buildings there date from the Tudor period. During this period Colchester was one of the most prosperous wool towns in England, and was also famed for its oysters. Flemish refugees in the 1560s brought innovations that revived the local cloth trade, establishing the Dutch Bay Hall for quality control of the textiles for which Colchester became famous. The old Roman wall runs along Northgate Street in the Dutch Quarter.

In the reign of &quot;Bloody Mary&quot; (1553–1558) Colchester became a centre of Protestant &quot;heresy&quot; and in consequence at least 19 local people were burned at the stake at the castle, at first in front, later within the walls. They are commemorated on a tablet near the altar of St Peter&#x27;s Church.

===17th and 18th century===


The town saw the start of the Stour Valley riots of 1642, when the town house of John Lucas, 1st Baron Lucas of Shenfield was attacked by a large crowd. In 1648, during the Second English Civil War, a Royalist army led by Lord Goring entered the town. A pursuing Parliamentary army led by Thomas Fairfax and Henry Ireton surrounded the town for eleven and a half weeks, a period known as the Siege of Colchester. It started on 13 June. The Royalists surrendered in the late summer (on 27 August Lord Goring signed the surrender document in the Kings Head Inn) and Charles Lucas and George Lisle were executed in the grounds of Colchester Castle. A small obelisk marks the spot where they fell.

Daniel Defoe mentions in &quot;A tour through England and Wales&quot; that the town lost 5259 people to the plague in 1665, &quot;more in proportion than any of its neighbours, or than the city of London&quot;. By the time he wrote this in 1722, however, he estimated its population to be around 40,000 (including &quot;out-villages&quot;).

Between 1797 and 1815 Colchester was the HQ of the Army&#x27;s Eastern District, had a garrison of up to 6,000, and played a main role in defence against a threatened French or Dutch invasion, At various times it was the base of such celebrated officers as Lord Cornwallis, Generals Sir James Craig and David Baird, and Captain William Napier. It was in a state of alarm during the invasion threat of 1803/4, a period well chronicled by the contemporary local author Jane Taylor.
===Victorian period===
Significant Victorian landmarks include Colchester Town Hall, the Jumbo Water Tower and the Albert Hall.

In 1884, the area was struck by the Colchester earthquake, estimated to have been 4.7 on the Richter Scale causing extensive regional damage.

The Paxman diesels business has been associated with Colchester since 1865 when James Noah Paxman founded a partnership with the brothers Henry and Charles Davey (&#x27;Davey, Paxman, and Davey&#x27;) and opened the Standard Ironworks. In 1925, Paxman produced its first spring injection oil engine and joined the English Electric Diesel Group in 1966later becoming part of the GEC Group. Since the 1930s the Paxman company&#x27;s main business has been the production of diesel engines.

===20th century and later===

In the early 20th century Colchester lobbied to be the seat for a new Church of England diocese for Essex, to be split off from the existing Diocese of Rochester. The bid was unsuccessful, with county town Chelmsford forming the seat of the new diocese.

In the 2nd World War Colchester&#x27;s main significance lay in its infantry and light-anti-aircraft training units, and in the Paxman factory, which supplied a large proportion of the engines for British submarines and landing craft. Occasionally hit by stray single German aircraft in 1940 and 1941, in 1942 more serious attempts to bomb its industries were made by the Luftwaffe. None of these attacks hit their targets, but a raid on 11 August bombed Severalls Hospital, and killed 38 elderly patients. In February 1944 a single raider caused a huge fire in the St Botolph&#x27;s area which gutted warehouses, shops and part of Paxman&#x27;s Britannia Works. The total wartime bombing death toll in the borough was 55.

The University of Essex was established at Wivenhoe Park in 1961. The £22.7M A120 Colchester Eastern Bypass opened in June 1982.

Colchester and the surrounding area is currently undergoing significant regeneration, including controversial greenfield residential development in Mile End and Braiswick. At the time of the 2011 United Kingdom census, Colchester and its surrounding built up area had a population of 121,859, marking a considerable rise from the previous census and with considerable development since 2001 and ongoing building plans; it has been named as one of Britain&#x27;s fastest growing towns. The local football team, Colchester United, moved into a brand new stadium at Cuckoo Farm in 2008.

On 20 May 2022, it was announced that as part of the Platinum Jubilee Civic Honours, what was then the Borough of Colchester would receive city status. It was slated to receive the status formally by letters patent on 12 September 2022, however following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, the ceremony was postponed. On 29 September 2022, the letters patent was made public, with Colchester receiving city status dated 5 September 2022 by the late Queen. Colchester officially received city status on 23 November 2022. Colchester was visited by King Charles III on 7 March 2023, in order to congratulate Colchester on receiving city status.

==Climate==

Colchester is in one of the driest regions of the United Kingdom with average annual precipitation at , although among the wetter places in Essex. Colchester is generally regarded as having an Oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;) like the rest of the United Kingdom. Its easterly position within the British Isles makes Colchester less prone to Atlantic depressions and weather fronts but more prone to droughts. This is because, like most areas in southeast England, Colchester&#x27;s weather is influenced more by Continental weather patterns than by Atlantic weather systems. This leads to a dry climate compared to the rest of the UK all year round and occasional (relative) extremes of temperatures during the year (occasional high 20 °Cs/low 30 °Cs during the summer) and quite a few nights below freezing during the winter months (daytime high temperatures are seldom below freezing). Any rainfall that does come from Atlantic weather systems is usually light, but a few heavy showers and thunderstorms can take place during the summer. Snow falls on average 13 days a year during winter and early spring.

The highest temperature recorded in Colchester was in July 2022 (during the 2022 European heatwaves), and the lowest was in December 2010.
==Garrison ==
Colchester has been an important military garrison since the Roman era. The Colchester Garrison is currently home to the 16th Air Assault Brigade. The Army&#x27;s only military corrective training centre, known colloquially within the forces and locally as &quot;The Glasshouse&quot; after the original military prison in Aldershot, is in Berechurch Hall Road, on the outskirts of Colchester. The centre holds men and women from all three services who are sentenced to serve periods of detention.

From 1998 to 2008, the garrison area underwent massive redevelopment. A lot of the Ministry of Defence land was sold for private housing development and parts of the garrison were moved. Many parts of the garrison now stand empty awaiting the second phase of the development.

Since 2006, Colchester has been one of 12 places in the UK where Royal Salutes are fired to mark Royal anniversaries and visits by foreign heads of state. From 2009, these salutes have taken place in Castle Park.

BFBS Radio broadcasts from studios on the base on 107.0FM as part of its UK Bases network.

==Governance==

Colchester City Council is the local authority.

The Member of Parliament for Colchester is Pam Cox of the Labour Party. The former MP, Liberal Democrat Sir Bob Russell, has held the ceremonial role of High Steward of Colchester since 2015.

In 2024, a local unitary authority, North-East Essex Unitary Authority, was proposed, which will include Colchester, Tendring and Braintree.

==Demography==
==Culture==

===Museums===
Colchester houses several museums. The Castle Museum, found within Colchester Castle, features an extensive exhibit on Roman Colchester. Nearby are Hollytrees Museum, a social history museum with children&#x27;s exhibits in the former home of Charles Gray, and the Natural History Museum, located in the former All Saints&#x27; Church. The Colchester Archaeological Trust have opened a visitor centre and museum at the former Cavalry Barracks to display finds from the Roman Circus, with replicas and models of the circus, as well as finds from the nearby Roman cemeteries. In 2014 brick and marble columns from the monumental façade of the precinct of the Temple of Claudius were discovered behind the High Street, with plans to make them visible to the public.

===Arts===
Opened in 1972, the Mercury Theatre is a repertory theatre. Located nearby is Colchester Arts Centre, a multi-function arts venue located in the former St Mary-at-the-Walls church, and home of the Colchester Beer Festival. The Headgate Theatre is also located in Colchester.

Firstsite is a contemporary art organisation, based in the Visual Arts Facility, which was designed by Rafael Viñoly, and opened in September 2011, at a total cost of approximately £25.5 million, £9 million more than the original estimate.

The Minories houses The Minories Galleries, which is managed by Colchester Institute and presents contemporary exhibitions by artists from the region. The building is owned by the Victor Batte-Lay Foundation.

There are several bars with live music.

In 2009, an art collective called &#x27;Slack Space&#x27; took up some of the closed-down shops in the centre and converted them into art galleries with the hope of promoting art and design. The Colchester School of Art, opened in 1885, is based in the Colchester Institute, near the centre.

A film festival, showcasing a selection of new feature and short films from around the world and centred at the VAF, was held from to 2012 to 2017 (excluding 2016). 
There are 12 cinema screens spread across the 8 screen Odeon, 3 screen Curzon and 1 screen in the firstsite gallery.

===Sport===
Local links with football began with the amateur club Colchester Town, which was formed in 1867 and dissolved in 1937. They were succeeded by professional club Colchester United, who compete in Football League Two (as of season 2023–24) and play home games at Colchester Community Stadium. Founded in 1937, the club entered the Football League in 1950, originally playing home games at their former Layer Road stadium until 2008. The club reached its highest league finish of 10th place in the Championship in 2006–07, and were one of the few teams to win the Watney Cup, in 1971.

Other sports teams based in the area include Colchester United Women Football Club, Colchester School of Gymnastics, Colchester Rugby Football Club, Colchester Swimming Club, Colchester Gladiators American Football Club, Colchester Weight Lifting Club, Colchester Powerlifting Club (ColPower) and Colchester &amp; East Essex Cricket Club. Essex County Cricket Club play some of their home games at Castle Park Cricket Ground, home of Colchester &amp; East Essex.

Sports facilities in Colchester include Colchester Leisure World, Colchester Garrison Athletics Stadium (a co-operative facility used by both the army and civilian population) and a skatepark.

===Media===
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia from the Sudbury TV transmitter. The city&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Essex on 103.5 FM, Heart East on 96.1 FM, Greatest Hits Radio East on 100.2 FM and Actual Radio which broadcast online. The local newspapers are Colchester Gazette, Essex County Standard and East Anglian Daily Times.

===Other===
The commercial centre is home to upmarket department store Fenwick (still referred to by locals by its former name of Williams &amp; Griffin (Willie Gees)), Primark, H&amp;M, Boots, WH Smith and many local independent stores.

==Landmarks==
=== Colchester War Memorial ===
Colchester suffered in the First World War, losing some 1,248 in the conflict. As early as 1918 prominent voices were calling for a war memorial, with Councillor Edgar A. Hunt making the first formal proposition in an open letter to the press published on Christmas Day of that year. Shortly after the publication of the letter, a committee was set up to decide the form of the monument, with several practical schemes favoured by the working class. The committee formed to choose a proposal decided on a sculptural monument on 16 May 1919 with a vote of 7 to 9. Following a visit to the Royal Academy&#x27;s War Memorial Exhibition, the sculptor Henry Charles Fehr was chosen to undertake the work, for which he was paid £3,000. The memorial consists of three human figures on a sculptural pedestal. The figures are of Saint George, an allegorical representation of peace and the goddess Nike.

===Roman walls===
Construction of the walls of Colchester took place between 65 and 80 AD, shortly after the destruction of the undefended &quot;colonia&quot; by Boudicca, and they continued in use until after the Siege of Colchester in 1648. Two large stretches of the wall are still standing on the west and north sides and a number of fragments are visible along the rest of the circuit. A notable survival is the Balkerne Gate, which is the earliest and most complete Roman gateway in the United Kingdom. A circular walk of nearly follows the course of the wall and the surviving portions.

===&quot;Jumbo&quot; water tower===
Completed in 1883 when the Town Council took over Colchester&#x27;s water supply, the water tower was originally called the &quot;Balkerne Water Tower&quot;, but soon became known as &quot;Jumbo&quot; because of its large size, which prompted the addition of an elephant-shaped weather vane at its peak. The tower was decommissioned in 1987 and has had several private owners pending redevelopment.

===Colchester Town Hall===

The town hall is built on the site of the original moot hall, first recorded in 1277 and demolished in 1843. Replacing a Victorian town hall which had become unstable, work on the present building started in 1897 to the design of John Belcher in the Edwardian Baroque style, and was opened in 1902 by former prime minister, the Earl of Rosebery. The building dominates the High Street and the 192-foot (58.5-metre) Victoria Tower is widely visible. The tower was intended to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria and was funded by a donation from James Noah Paxman, the founder of Davey, Paxman &amp; Co. It features four allegorical figures by L J Watts representing engineering, military defence, agriculture and fishery. At the top of the tower is a large bronze figure representing Saint Helena (the patron saint of Colchester) holding the True Cross; a local story says that a councillor was dispatched to Italy to find a statue of the saint, but could only find one of the Virgin Mary, which then had to be modified locally.

==Education==
===Secondary education===
As is the case for the rest of Essex, Colchester&#x27;s state schooling operates a two-tier system. Two of the local secondary schools are selective, Colchester Royal Grammar School and Colchester County High School for Girls, the remainder being comprehensives. Comprehensive secondary schools include The Gilberd School, Colchester Academy, Philip Morant School and College, St Helena School, St Benedict&#x27;s Catholic College, Thomas Lord Audley School, Paxman Academy and Trinity School.

===Private schools===
Private schools in Colchester include St. Mary&#x27;s School, Oxford House School and Colchester High School.

===Tertiary===
The University of Essex is located to the east of Colchester in Wivenhoe Park, in the civil parish of Wivenhoe. Other tertiary institutions include Colchester Sixth Form College and Colchester Institute. Colchester also has an ACL.

==Transport==
===Buses===
Colchester&#x27;s bus services are operated primarily by First Essex and Arriva Colchester, as well as by Hedingham &amp; Chambers, Beeston&#x27;s, Ipswich Buses, Stephensons of Essex and Panther Travel (Essex). The bus station is located in Osborne Street, on the southern edge of the centre.
==== Colchester Rapid Transit System ====
The Colchester Rapid Transit System is a bus rapid transport line set to open in spring 2025. The project will be the first rapid-transit system in Essex and will be operated by FirstEssex.

===Railway===
Colchester Town and Hythe stations are on the Sunshine Coast Line operated by Greater Anglia, and linked to the rest of the network at Colchester North station, which lies just outside this area.

===Roads===
Colchester is linked to London and East Anglia by the A12, which bypasses the town to the north and east, and is the region&#x27;s main trunk route. The A120 connects Colchester with Harwich in the east and Stansted Airport and the M11 motorway in the west.

===Port===
Colchester was historically a port, with a regular weekly shipping service to London by 1637, and about 3,000 vessels per year using the port in 1892. The former quay of The Hythe is no longer in use, partly because the river has silted up, although Colchester is still a registered port (code GBCOL).

==References in literature==
The Roman historian Tacitus mentions Colchester (Camulodunum) in &quot;The Annals of Imperial Rome&quot;. In Book XIV he describes how &#x27;...the Roman ex-soldiers...had recently established a settlement at Camulodunum&#x27;, later burned down in the Iceni rebellion.

It is the only town in Britain to have been explicitly mentioned in George Orwell&#x27;s 1949 novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; as being the target of a nuclear attack during the (fictional) Atomic Wars of the 1950s.

==In popular culture==
Colchester is reputed to be the home of three of the best known English nursery rhymes: &#x27;Old King Cole&#x27;, &#x27;Humpty Dumpty&#x27; and &#x27;Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star&#x27;, although the legitimacy of all three claims is disputed.

Local legend places Colchester as the seat of King Cole (or Coel) of the rhyme &quot;Old King Cole&quot;, a legendary ancient king of Britain. The name Colchester is from Latin: the place-name suffixes &quot;chester&quot;, &quot;cester&quot;, and &quot;caster&quot; derive from the Latin word &quot;castrum&quot; (fortified place). In folk etymology the name Colchester was thought of as meaning Cole&#x27;s Castle , though this theory does not have academic support. In the legend Helena, the daughter of Cole, married the Roman senator Constantius Chlorus, who had been sent by Rome as an ambassador and was named as Cole&#x27;s successor. Helena&#x27;s son became Emperor Constantine I. Helena was canonised as Saint Helena of Constantinople and is credited with finding the true cross and the remains of the Magi. She is now the patron saint of Colchester. This is recognised in the emblem of Colchester: a cross and three crowns. The Mayor&#x27;s medallion contains a Byzantine style icon of Saint Helena. A local secondary school – St Helena&#x27;s – is named after her, and her statue is atop the town hall, although local legend is that it was originally a statue of Blessed Virgin Mary which was later fitted with a cross.

Colchester is a widely credited source of the rhyme Humpty Dumpty. During the siege of Colchester in the Civil War, a Royalist sniper known as One-Eyed Thompson sat in the belfry of the church of St Mary-at-the-Walls (&quot;Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall&quot;) and was given the nickname Humpty Dumpty, most likely because of his size, &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot; being a common insult for the overweight. Thompson was shot down (&quot;Humpty Dumpty had a great fall&quot;) and, shortly after, the town was lost to the Parliamentarians (&quot;all the king&#x27;s horses and all the king&#x27;s men / couldn&#x27;t put Humpty together again.&quot;) Another version says that Humpty Dumpty was a cannon on the top of the church. The church of St Mary-at-the-Walls still retains its Norman tower until the top few feet, which are a Georgian repair.

The third rhyme said to have come from Colchester is Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, which was written by Jane Taylor who lived in the Dutch Quarter, and published in 1806 with the title &quot;The Star&quot;. In 2024, a statue sculpted by Mandy Pratt that shows Taylor and her sister Ann was unveiled in Colchester High Street, following a campaign by Sir Bob Russell. 

Colchester has also been suggested as one of the potential sites of Camelot, on account of having been the capital of Roman Britain and its ancient name of &quot;Camulodunum&quot;: this is not considered likely by academics, as in Arthurian times Colchester was under Saxon control.

The first part of Daniel Defoe&#x27;s 1722 novel &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; was set in Colchester.

Colchester was also a named line of lathe machinery.

In the 1949 book &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, Colchester was the scene of a nuclear detonation.

The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes &quot;The Lodger&quot; and &quot;Closing Time&quot; are set in Colchester, although they were filmed in Cardiff.

In the 1966 Asterix comic book &quot;Asterix in Britain&quot; the Camulodunum rugby team wins a game against Durovernum (Roman name for Canterbury). The uniforms worn during the match in the book are similar to the modern kit of Colchester United.

Colchester appears in the 2020 video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&quot;, recreated as it was in the early medieval period.

<text>Hooper&#x27;s Store is a fictional business and meeting-place on the television show &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. When the show began, the store was one of the four main locations on the set representing the fictional Sesame Street, with the 123 Sesame Street brownstone, the Fix-It Shop, and the carriage house. In the show, the original owner was Mr. Hooper, a gruff but friendly grocer. 

After the death in 1982 of Will Lee, the actor who played Mr. Hooper, the store was managed by other characters, including David, Mr. Handford, and Alan.

==History==

The fictional store was said to be founded by Mr. Harold Hooper in 1951 as a general store. In canon, the food menu was extensive and suited to the different characters that lived on Sesame Street, a fictional Manhattan street. Along with traditional American diner-type food, the store sold a wide range of goods from dry goods to soap dishes and stranger goods such as empty cigar boxes (in &quot;Christmas Eve on Sesame Street&quot;) and birdseed milkshakes for Big Bird.

In &quot;Street Gang: The Complete History of Sesame Street&quot;, Michael Davis notes that the store was one of the early core concepts that producer Jon Stone brought to the show:

Over the course of the show, the store often acts as a gathering spot for the characters. In &quot;Sesame Street Unpaved&quot;, David Borgenicht writes:

==David and Gina==
The fictional character David (Northern Calloway), a young African-American who moved to Sesame Street in the early 1970s, was soon hired by Mr. Hooper as an assistant. David was originally conceived as a hip, upbeat singer fresh out of high school who was fond of eccentric hats. Although he appeared in Season 3, he began working at the store in Season 4 while studying law at college.

Upon Mr. Hooper&#x27;s death, which correlated with the death of his actor, Will Lee, in real life, the store was left to David in-universe. During seasons 16 and 17, a teenaged boy named Piri (played by Eddie Castrodad) worked at the store. Following this, David hired a new resident of the area, Gina (played by Alison Bartlett-O&#x27;Reilly) in 1987. This young teenage girl helped David as he himself had helped Mr. Hooper.

Bert was hired to help David in one Sesame Street book. During his employment he accidentally broke a teapot given to David by Mr. Hooper, but was forgiven for the mistake.

Actor Calloway faced health issues in 1989, and left the series. His character moved to a farm, to live with his grandmother. The actor died in 1990.

David&#x27;s final appearance was the season finale of Season 20 (the birth of Maria and Luis&#x27; daughter). Gina continued to work at the store for a couple of years after it was bought out by Mr. Handford. In 1995, she got a new job at the local daycare, until she finished college and remained on the show as a veterinarian.

==Mr. Handford and Carlo==
The enthusiastic Mr. Handford was a new character brought to the show exclusively to run the store, a change from the previous management of David, who started out as a character before he became the store operator. This African-American man was a retired firefighter who bought the store to keep active. Gina continued to work in the store with Mr. Handford as her new boss.

Although Leonard Jackson played him in Season 21, he was then recast and David Smyrl took over the role. While Jackson portrayed Mr. Handford as something of a “grumpy old man” with little patience for his friends’ quirks, Smyrl made the character much more cheerful, friendly, and quite young at heart.

In 1991, Hooper&#x27;s Store was beginning to fall into disrepair. The final nail in the coffin came when Sully and Biff tried to hang up a picture frame for Mr. Handford, but Biff&#x27;s misplaced hammer swing caused the entire woodwork of the store to collapse. No one was hurt, but the store was ruined, and Mr. Handford considered closing the store for good. Everyone convinced him that they needed him, and the store, so they all pitched in to rebuild it. The construction brought minor, cosmetic changes to the store, most notably a back door accessing the basement and kitchen.

A Hispanic-American teenager named Carlo (played by Carlo Alban) first appeared in 1993 as one of Gordon&#x27;s students. In 1995, he was hired to work at the store.

These characters ran the store until 1998 when the actors left the show. There was no on-screen explanation to the characters&#x27; departures, though it has been stated in canon that Mr. Handford had retired, and sold the store to Alan (played by Alan Muraoka) that year.

==Alan==

Alan Muraoka joined the cast in 1998, as Alan, the new store owner. Muraoka has commented that his casting was atypical for the role, as most of the previous owners &quot;were older and more grandfather-ish.&quot;

In season 35, Natalie was hired by Alan as a replacement while he took a vacation. Big Bird and Baby Bear are initially very anxious of the big change, but Natalie gradually assures them things will be fine. Natalie was played by guest star Natalie Portman. Portman was set to star as Natalie in three episodes in the 2004 season, but due to her losing her voice, Sesame Workshop had to film the other two episodes with Gabi in charge.

In Season 38, Chris Robinson joined Alan in running Mr. Hooper&#x27;s Store. Chris is played by Chris Knowings, and is the nephew of Gordon and Susan.

A 2009 article about the series described the store as becoming a .

==In themed entertainment==

Various Sesame Place theme parks have featured the store. Originally at the Pennsylvania location, Mr. Hooper&#x27;s Store was part of a play area.

Japan&#x27;s Sesame Place included Mr. Hooper&#x27;s Store, a gift shop.

For the 50th anniversary of the series, in 2019, an Australian pop-up exhibition of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; named its gift shop &quot;Hooper&#x27;s Store.&quot;

<text>Patrick Sarsfield Donegan (29 October 1923 – 26 November 2000) was an Irish Fine Gael politician who served as a government minister from 1973 to 1977. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1954 to 1957 and 1961 to 1981. He also served as a Senator for the Agricultural Panel from 1957 to 1961.

He was born on 29 October 1923 in Monasterboice, County Louth, son of Thomas Francis Donegan, a publican and farmer, and Rose Ann Donegan (née Butterly). He was educated at a Christian Brothers School in Drogheda, County Louth, and at the Vincentian Castleknock College, Dublin. 

Donegan was elected as a Fine Gael TD for the Louth constituency at the 1954 general election. He lost his seat at the 1957 general election, but was elected to Seanad Éireann as a Senator for the Agricultural Panel. He regained his Dáil seat at the 1961 general election.

In the Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition government which took office after the 1973 general election Donegan was appointed as Minister for Defence. In October 1976, Donegan made a speech on an official visit to the opening of new kitchen facilities in an army barracks at Mullingar, County Westmeath in which he described as a &quot;thundering disgrace&quot; President Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh&#x27;s refusal to sign the Emergency Powers Bill 1976. Ó Dálaigh had instead exercised his powers under Article 26 of the Constitution to refer it to the Supreme Court. The Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, refused Donegan&#x27;s resignation. On 21 October, Fianna Fáil proposed a motion in the Dáil calling on the minister to resign, which was defeated. Ó Dálaigh viewed the refusal to remove the minister as an affront to his office by the government and resigned on 22 October 1976.

In December 1976, Donegan was appointed as Minister for Lands. In February 1977, this office was restructured as the Minister for Fisheries. He served in cabinet until the government lost office after the 1977 general election.

Donegan retired from politics at the 1981 general election, and died in 2000. Tributes in the Dáil were led by John Bruton as Fine Gael leader. He was buried in his home town of Monasterboice, County Louth.

<doc id="264113" wikidata="Q4659743" url="?curid=264113" title="A Special Sesame Street Christmas">
<text>A Special Sesame Street Christmas is a 1978 CBS Christmas special, made the same year as the better-known &quot;Christmas Eve on Sesame Street&quot;. The special was first broadcast on Friday, December 8, 1978, at 8 PM ET on CBS, pre-empting &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; that week, starring Leslie Uggams.

The special features only three of the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; Muppets: Oscar the Grouch, Big Bird, and Barkley the dog. Barkley is played by gymnast Toby Towson. The puppet used for the special was different from the one used for the series, making him five feet tall, or higher, at times in the special. Mr. Hooper, David, Bob, and Maria are the only humans from the regular cast to make appearances, while most of the regulars are replaced by a large, somewhat all-star cast.

The special features many plot elements that are very loosely tied together, the most important being Oscar as the &quot;Ebenezer Scrooge&quot; on Sesame Street, as a minor takeoff on Charles Dickens&#x27; 1843 novella &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. They include Leslie Uggams thinking lemonade was hot chocolate, singer Anne Murray and a magic eggnog container, Oscar adopting a kitten with a broken leg, and Ethel Merman calling Imogene Coca an idiot. Also appearing are Dick Smothers (only one half of the Smothers Brothers was hired for the special), Henry Fonda and Michael Jackson of The Jacksons.

The special was mainly produced for CBS not by the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop), but by Bob Banner Associates, notable for Perry Como&#x27;s Christmas specials. The producers paid CTW for the use of the set, some of the adult characters, Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch, with everything else, including the script and the Barkley costume, provided by Banner staffers.

This program was nominated in the 31st Annual Emmy Awards (1979) under the category of &quot;Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program&quot;, losing to &quot;Christmas Eve on Sesame Street&quot;. Both 
specials are now available on DVD.

<doc id="264115" wikidata="Q6766274" url="?curid=264115" title="Marjorie Harris">
<text>Marjorie Harris (born 15 September 1937) is a Canadian writer of non-fiction, particularly in gardening.

== Early life ==
Marjorie Kathleen Harris, nee Stibbards, was born in Shaunavon, Saskatchewan, the eldest of three children of Bernard and Kay Stibbards. Her father’s work as a Baptist minister led the family to move to many different places over the years, including Goose Bay, Labrador, and Vancouver, British Columbia. During the Second World War, she lived with her mother and siblings in Winnipeg, while her father was overseas as an air force chaplain. She attended McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, and graduated with a B.A. in English in 1959.

== Writing career ==
Harris’s writing career began when she began working for Maclean’s magazine in 1966. She went on to be a freelance journalist for Saturday Night (magazine), Chatelaine (magazine), Weekend, The Canadian, Artscanada, Quest, Toronto Life, Financial Post magazine, Flare, and the Toronto Star, writing on topics including design, art, and feminism. In the 1970s, she was associate editor at Chatelaine for several years.

In 1988, she decided to focus her writing on gardening and plants, and began to write articles on the subject for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; and &quot;Toronto Life&quot;. For her first gardening book, &quot;The Canadian Gardener&quot;, published in 1990, she and photographer Tim Saunders travelled across Canada, talking to dozens of gardeners to get their best advice.

She was editor-in-chief of &quot;Gardening Life&quot; magazine and wrote regular columns on gardening for &quot;The Globe and Mail.&quot;
Much of her writing has focused on her own garden in midtown Toronto, a narrow plot that she has cultivated carefully to make the most of the space. She strongly promotes ecological gardening principles and growing native plants that are adapted to Canadian conditions.

== Broadcasting career ==
Harris has written and produced documentaries for CBC radio. She had a radio host job at CBC Radio’s Metro Morning as “The Urban Gardener.” For many years, she was a regular guest on This Country in the Morning hosted by Peter Gzowski, a popular CBC radio program. In 2003, she appeared in the Recreating Eden TV series episode “A Perfect Life.” Harris has also created several short videos for YouTube aimed at home gardeners and contributed gardening advice to CBC Life.

== Archives ==
The McMaster university library acquired Marjorie Harris’s archives in July 2005 and March 2006. She was honoured there in 2007 with an exhibition titled “Marjorie Harris’s Garden of the World.”

== Awards ==

McMaster University Distinguished Alumni Award

== Personal life ==
Her first marriage was to television producer and musician Barry Harris; she has two children, Christopher and Jennifer. Currently, she lives in Toronto with her second husband, writer Jack Batten.

<doc id="264116" wikidata="Q356460" url="?curid=264116" title="Dick Spring">
<text>Richard Martin Spring (born 29 August 1950) is an Irish former Labour Party politician who served as Tánaiste from 1982 to 1987, 1992 to November 1994, and December 1994 to 1997, Leader of the Labour Party from 1982 to 1997, Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1993 to November 1994 and December 1994 to 1997, Minister for Energy from 1983 to 1987, and Minister for the Environment from 1982 to 1983. He was a Teachta Dála (TD) for Kerry North from 1981 to 2002.

Before his political career, Spring was a successful sportsman who played for the Ireland national rugby union team and the Kerry GAA football and hurling teams.

==Early life==
Spring was born in Tralee, County Kerry in 1950, the son of Dan and Anna Spring (). He was educated at Cistercian College in Roscrea, County Tipperary, and at Trinity College Dublin, and qualified as a barrister at the King&#x27;s Inns. He is a descendant of the Anglo-Irish Spring family that settled in County Kerry in the late 16th century.

==Sporting career==
Spring played Gaelic football and hurling for Kerry during the 1970s. He played his club football with the Kerins O&#x27;Rahilly&#x27;s club in Tralee and hurling with Crotta O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s; he also played underage hurling with Austin Stacks and won a minor county championship in 1967. His father Dan won two All-Ireland Senior Football Championships in 1939 and 1940.

He then won rugby union caps for Munster, and lined out for London Irish in the UK. He also was capped for Ireland three times during the 1979 Five Nations Championship, debuting against on 20 January 1979 at Lansdowne Road, and receiving his last international cap on 17 February 1979 against at Lansdowne Road.

==Political career==
===Early career===
Spring&#x27;s political life began when he successfully contested the 1979 Kerry County Council election for the county electoral area of Tralee, succeeding his father Dan Spring TD on Kerry County Council that year. Spring senior had been a TD for Kerry North since 1943, mostly representing Labour, but he was a member of the National Labour Party from 1944 to 1950.

He was first elected to Dáil Éireann in the 1981 general election for the constituency of Kerry North, again succeeding his father. The Labour Party formed a coalition Government with Fine Gael and Spring was appointed a junior minister on his first day as a TD.

===Leadership===
When Michael O&#x27;Leary resigned as party leader after the February 1982 general election, Spring allowed his name to go forward in the leadership contest. He defeated Barry Desmond and Michael D. Higgins, but inherited the leadership of a deeply divided party. Spring was a strong opponent of anti-coalition politics and systematically removed Trotskyist activists from the party. Most notably he expelled the Militant Tendency in 1989 (which later became Socialist Party), including Joe Higgins and Clare Daly.

===Tánaiste (1982–1987)===
Following the November 1982 general election Labour again formed a coalition government with Fine Gael. Spring was appointed Tánaiste and Minister for the Environment. In a reshuffle following the resignation from cabinet of former Labour leader Frank Cluskey in December 1983, Spring was appointed as Minister for Energy. He was closely involved in the negotiations which led to the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985. In January 1987, the Labour Party withdrew from the government on budgetary issues. At the 1987 general election, Spring narrowly escaped losing his seat when he was re-elected by just four votes. Fianna Fáil took office in a minority government after the election.

===Opposition===
The Labour Party selected Mary Robinson as its candidate in the 1990 presidential election. Robinson was elected, and this success enhanced the credibility of his leadership of the party. For Spring, his period in opposition coincided with the exposure of several business scandals and allowed him to shine as a critic of the Fianna Fáil government, led by Charles Haughey.

===&quot;Spring Tide&quot; and return to power===

In the 1992 general election the party increased its number of Dáil seats from 15 to 33, its largest number of seats to that point, an achievement dubbed the &quot;Spring Tide&quot;. After the election, no government was formed when the 27th Dáil met. After some weeks of stalemate, Spring entered negotiations with Albert Reynolds—who had taken over as Taoiseach from Haughey in February 1992—over the Christmas period on a new programme for government. This was approved by a special party conference of over 1,000 delegates at Dublin&#x27;s National Concert Hall in January 1993, though there were some Labour Party TDs who dissented from the leadership position and wanted a coalition with Fine Gael. The Labour Party entered a coalition government with Fianna Fáil and thus returned Reynolds to power. Spring was appointed Tánaiste for the second time, and also as Minister for Foreign Affairs.

Labour took six of the fifteen cabinet ministries and had much of its election manifesto accepted by Fianna Fáil. Labour ministers led the new Departments of Equality and Law Reform and the reformed of Arts and Culture. Ethics legislation was to outlaw conflicts of interest. Male homosexual acts were to be decriminalised. Purchase of condoms without medical prescription was to be allowed. An extensive programme of family law reform and provision for a divorce referendum was to be undertaken. Spring insisted on a formalised system of programme managers, and state-paid advisers to push the new government&#x27;s policy platform.

However support for the Labour Party declined, particularly as many voters felt betrayed by Labour for going into government with Fianna Fáil. In June 1994, the Labour Party performed disastrously in by-elections in Dublin South-Central and in Cork North-Central. In both cases, the seats were won by Democratic Left. This had grave implications for the electoral health of the party and therefore for the policy of the Labour leadership.

In late 1994, Reynolds wished to appoint the Attorney General, Harry Whelehan, as President of the High Court, but delayed for over a month. Spring had reservations about Whelehan being suitable, owing to the alleged laxity of his handling of a particular child abuse criminal case, involving a disgraced Catholic priest. Reynolds for his part could not understand why Spring was against Whelehan being nominated to the High Court, and yet had no concerns with Whelehan serving as Attorney General. Reynolds became annoyed with Spring&#x27;s stance, and his failure to communicate his reservations, and decided to proceed anyway, whilst calling Spring&#x27;s bluff. Spring and the other Labour ministers withdrew from the cabinet meeting which proceeded to recommend Whelehan&#x27;s appointment to the President. Immediately afterwards, Reynolds implemented the decision.

There followed a rather heated discussion in the Dáil, concerning the appointment. Fine Gael asked questions about Whelehan&#x27;s suitability and objectivity. This was supportive of Spring&#x27;s position. Democratic Left TD Pat Rabbitte then implied that the Catholic hierarchy was instructing Reynolds to appoint Whelehan. Reynolds became irate with this allegation and responded angrily. Reynolds now realised that Spring was uncompromising about Whelehan. To remain in government, Reynolds removed Whelehan; however, Spring refused to go back into government with Reynolds. Whelehan served as President of the High Court for one day.

Spring proceeded to withdraw from the government. The minority Reynolds government then lost a vote of confidence in the Dáil. Reynolds resigned as party leader but continued as a caretaker Taoiseach. Spring entered into negotiations with Reynolds&#x27; successor as party, Bertie Ahern, the Minister for Finance. In early December, they agreed to reform the Fianna Fáil–Labour Government. On the eve of that government being formed, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; published a report that Ahern knew more about an aspect of the scandal that had brought down Reynolds than had previously been known. Spring broke off negotiations with Fianna Fáil, and instead pursued negotiations to form a coalition with Fine Gael and Democratic Left. In December 1994, Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left formed a coalition government, referred to as the Rainbow Coalition, forestalling the possibility of an election. Spring returned to his positions as Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs. This was the first occasion on which a new Irish government was formed without a general election. The previous Fianna Fáil and Labour Programme for Government was substantially adopted by the new government and in return for making John Bruton the Taoiseach, Ruairi Quinn of Labour became the first-ever Labour Minister for Finance.

During his period as Foreign Minister, Spring played a role in the Northern Ireland peace process, and along with Reynolds was involved in negotiations leading to the Provisional Irish Republican Army and loyalist ceasefires of 1994. With Reynolds, he received warm applause in the Dáil on the announcement of the Downing Street Declaration in December 1993. He also advanced Ireland&#x27;s membership of the Partnership for Peace, a sister organization of NATO, a controversial issue due to Ireland&#x27;s policy of neutrality.

===Resignation as party leader and defeat as TD===
In the 1997 general election the Labour Party fell to 17 seats and returned to opposition. This was considered by some to be a punishment by the electorate for the 1993 decision to enter a coalition with Fianna Fáil. By others, it was considered a punishment for changing horses at the end of 1994, to remain in power. A front-page editorial in the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; on the day before the election, entitled &quot;Payback Time&quot; and calling on support for Fianna Fáil, had a direct and severe impact on the Labour Party. The &quot;Independent&quot; newspaper group had revealed many scandals involving Labour ministers abusing the perks of office in the year leading up to the election. The article was controversial because Spring had taken decisions in office which went against the broader business interests of the &quot;Independent&quot;&#x27;s owner Anthony O&#x27;Reilly, who was accused by Labour supporters of having attempted to use his paper&#x27;s political influence to intimidate the government into favouring companies linked to O&#x27;Reilly. The impact of the article is uncertain but the Labour Party suffered significant electoral losses and the outgoing coalition was defeated. In the presidential election of the same year the Labour Party candidate, Adi Roche, came fourth out of five candidates. Following that defeat, Spring resigned as Labour Party leader, having served 15 years — one of the longest-serving party leaders in Ireland.

He remained a TD, being appointed a director in the formerly state-owned recently privatized telecommunications company Eircom in 1999. Its initial flotation led to a stock market bubble which affected a large number of small shareholders. It was later revealed that he did not purchase shares in the company.

Spring lost his seat in a shock result at the 2002 general election. He has not sought political office since.

==Political legacy==
In Irish political circles, the role of foreign minister was considered a poisoned chalice because of the challenge of resolving the delicate problem of how to de-escalate tensions in Northern Ireland, when both sides were wary of Irish governmental policy. Albert Reynolds, and Dick Spring, placed Northern Ireland at the top of the government agenda. Both were helped considerably by the initiative of John Hume, and the understanding built up between Reynolds, and British Prime Minister John Major. Spring devoted considerable energy and resources towards increasing Ireland&#x27;s international influence and diplomatic ties in the UN, in the post Cold War world.

As Foreign Minister, there was much critical comment in the media on Spring&#x27;s extensive foreign travel. Spring got even harsher criticism, for using the Government Jet to reduce journey times between his home in Tralee and his office in Dublin. However, he did conduct, for the first time, a public consultative process that involved a wide range of citizenry and social groups as well as members of the diaspora, in the re-shaping of Irish foreign policy through the first-ever White Paper on Foreign Policy in 1996.

Critics of Dick Spring have described him as a champagne socialist, owing to his choice of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel when staying in New York as Foreign Minister, instead of staying in the then Irish-owned Fitzpatrick Hotel. Spring brought the Irish Labour Party unprecedented exposure and power in government, at a time when the two significantly larger right-of-centre political blocs had precedence in every election.

==Subsequent life==
Spring later became involved in the Cyprus dispute as a United Nations envoy.

Spring received a directorship appointment to the Irish state telecom enterprise, Eircom, in advance of the scheduled privatisation. As leader of a left-of-centre party, this was to endorse the privatization and gain consent from the labour unions to the privatisation plan. However, the privatisation was a financial disaster for members of the public, who became ordinary shareholders in the privatisation process. Spring became the target for much of the discontent. Spring&#x27;s low work involvement, and generous remuneration package, were openly described as &#x27;scandalous&#x27;, by shareholder advocate Senator Shane Ross. He continues to hold a directorship, with the Financial Services firm FEXCO, based in Killorglin, County Kerry.

Spring lives in Tralee with his wife Kristi (), an American whom he met while working in New York as a bartender. They have three children. His nephew Arthur Spring was a Labour Party TD for Kerry North–West Limerick until March 2016, having first been a councillor for the Tralee electoral area of Kerry County Council. Spring is a member of Ballybunion Golf Club, and has invited former U.S. President Bill Clinton, amongst others, to visit there.

He is a director of Allied Irish Bank and receives annual pension payments of €121,108.

<text>A shirt is a cloth garment for the upper body (from the neck to the waist).

Originally an undergarment worn exclusively by men, it has become, in American English, a catch-all term for a broad variety of upper-body garments and undergarments. In British English, a shirt is more specifically a garment with a collar, sleeves with cuffs, and a full vertical opening with buttons or snaps (North Americans would call that a &quot;dress shirt&quot;, a specific type of collared shirt). A shirt can also be worn with a necktie under the shirt collar.

== History ==
The world&#x27;s oldest preserved garment, discovered by Flinders Petrie, is a &quot;highly sophisticated&quot; linen shirt from a First Dynasty Egyptian tomb at Tarkan, dated to : &quot;the shoulders and sleeves have been finely pleated to give form-fitting trimness while allowing the wearer room to move. The small fringe formed during weaving along one edge of the cloth has been placed by the designer to decorate the neck opening and side seam.&quot;

The shirt was an item of clothing that only men could wear as underwear, until the twentieth century. Although the women&#x27;s chemise was a closely related garment to the men&#x27;s, it is the men&#x27;s garment that became the modern shirt. In the Middle Ages, it was a plain, undyed garment worn next to the skin and under regular garments. In medieval artworks, the shirt is only visible (uncovered) on humble characters, such as shepherds, prisoners, and penitents. In the seventeenth century, men&#x27;s shirts were allowed to show, with much the same erotic import as visible underwear today. In the eighteenth century, instead of underpants, men &quot;relied on the long tails of shirts ... to serve the function of drawers. Eighteenth-century costume historian Joseph Strutt believed that men who did not wear shirts to bed were indecent. Even as late as 1879, a visible shirt with nothing over it was considered improper.

The shirt sometimes had frills at the neck or cuffs. In the sixteenth century, men&#x27;s shirts often had embroidery, and sometimes frills or lace at the neck and cuffs and through the eighteenth-century long neck frills, or jabots, were fashionable. Coloured shirts began to appear in the early nineteenth century, as can be seen in the paintings of George Caleb Bingham. They were considered casual wear, for lower-class workers only, until the twentieth century. For a gentleman, &quot;to wear a sky-blue shirt was unthinkable in 1860, but had become standard by 1920 and, in 1980, constituted the most commonplace event.&quot;

European and American women began wearing shirts in 1860, when the Garibaldi shirt, a red shirt as worn by the freedom fighters under Giuseppe Garibaldi, was popularized by Empress Eugénie of France. At the end of the nineteenth century, the &quot;Century Dictionary&quot; described an ordinary shirt as &quot;of cotton, with linen bosom, wristbands and cuffs prepared for stiffening with starch, the collar and wristbands being usually separate and adjustable&quot;.

The first documented appearance of the expression &quot;To give the shirt off one&#x27;s back&quot;, happened in 1771 as an idiom that indicates extreme desperation or generosity and is still in common usage. In 1827 Hannah Montague, a housewife in upstate New York, invents the detachable collar. Tired of constantly washing her husband&#x27;s entire shirt when only the collar needed it, she cut off his collars and devised a way of attaching them to the neckband after washing. It was not until the 1930s that collar stays became popular, although these early accessories resembled tie clips more than the small collar stiffeners available today. They connected the collar points to the necktie, keeping them in place.

== Types ==
* Camp shirt – a loose, straight-cut, short sleeved shirt or blouse with a simple placket front-opening and a &quot;camp collar&quot;.

* T-shirt – also &quot;tee shirt&quot;, a casual shirt without a collar or buttons, made of a stretchy, finely knit fabric, usually cotton, and usually short-sleeved. Originally worn under other shirts, it is now a common shirt for everyday wear in some countries.
** Long-sleeved T-shirt – a T-shirt with long sleeves that extend to cover the arms.
** Ringer T-shirt – tee with a separate piece of fabric sewn on as the collar and sleeve hems.
**Raglan T-shirt – a T-shirt with a raglan sleeve; a sleeve that extends in one piece fully to the collar, leaving a diagonal seam from underarm to collarbone.
** Halfshirt – a high-hemmed T-shirt
** Sleeveless shirt – a shirt manufactured without sleeves, or one whose sleeves have been cut off, also called a tank top
***A-shirt or vest or singlet (in British English) – essentially a sleeveless shirt with large armholes and a large neck hole, often worn by labourers or athletes for increased movability.

** Rugby shirt – a long-sleeved polo shirt, traditionally of rugged construction in thick cotton or wool, but often softer today
** Henley shirt – a collarless polo shirt
* Baseball shirt (jersey) – usually distinguished by a three-quarters sleeve, team insignia, and flat waist seam
* Sweatshirt – long-sleeved athletic shirt of heavier material, with or without hood
* Tunic – primitive shirt, distinguished by two-piece construction. Initially a men&#x27;s garment, is normally seen in modern times being worn by women
* Shirtwaist – historically (circa. 1890–1920) a woman&#x27;s tailored shirt (also called a &quot;tailored waist&quot;) cut like a man&#x27;s dress shirt; in contemporary usage, a woman&#x27;s dress cut like a men&#x27;s dress shirt to the waist, then extended into dress length at the bottom

*Overshirt are a type of shirt that can be worn as jackets. It is worn over a shirt.
* Punishment shirts were special shirts made for the condemned, either those cursed supernaturally, such as the poisoned shirt that killed Creusa (daughter of Creon), the Shirt of Nessus used to kill Hercules, those used to execute people in ancient Rome, such as the Tunica molesta, and those used in church heresy trials, such as the Shirt of Flame, or the Sanbenito

== Parts of shirt ==
Many terms are used to describe and differentiate types of shirts (and upper-body garments in general) and their construction. The smallest differences may have significance to a cultural or occupational group. Recently, (late twentieth century, into the twenty-first century) it has become common to use tops as a form of advertisement. Many of these distinctions apply to other upper-body garments, such as coats and sweaters.

=== Shoulders and arms ===

==== Sleeves ====

Shirts may:
* have no covering of the shoulders or arms – a tube top (not reaching higher than the armpits, staying in place by elasticity)
* have only shoulder straps, such as spaghetti straps
* cover the shoulders, but without sleeves
* have shoulderless sleeves, short or long, with or without shoulder straps, that expose the shoulders, but cover the rest of the arm from the biceps and triceps down to at least the elbow
* have short sleeves, varying from cap sleeves (covering only the shoulder and not extending below the armpit) to half sleeves (elbow length), with some having quarter-length sleeves (reaching to a point that covers half of the biceps and triceps area)
* have three-quarter-length sleeves (reaching to a point between the elbow and the wrist)
* have long sleeves (reaching a point to the wrist to a little beyond wrist)

==== Cuffs ====

Shirts with long sleeves may further be distinguished by the cuffs:

* no buttons – a closed placket cuff
* buttons (or analogous fasteners such as snaps) – single or multiple. A single button or pair aligned parallel with the cuff hem is considered a button cuff. Multiple buttons aligned perpendicular to the cuff hem, or parallel to the placket constitute a barrel cuff.
* buttonholes designed for cufflinks
** a French cuff, where the end half of the cuff is folded over the cuff itself and fastened with a cufflink. This type of cuff has four buttons and a short placket.
** more formally, a link cuff – fastened like a French cuff, except is not folded over, but instead hemmed, at the edge of the sleeve.
* asymmetrical designs, such as one-shoulder, one-sleeve or with sleeves of different lengths.

=== Lower hem ===
* hanging to the waist
* leaving the belly button area bare (much more common for women than for men). See halfshirt.
* covering the crotch
* covering part of the legs (essentially this is a dress; however, a piece of clothing is perceived either as a shirt (worn with trousers) or as a dress (in Western culture mainly worn by women)).
* going to the floor (as a pajama shirt)

=== Body ===
* vertical opening on the front side, all the way down, with buttons or zipper. When fastened with buttons, this opening is often called the placket front.
* similar opening, but in back.
* left and right front side not separable, put on over the head; with regard to upper front side opening:
** V-shaped permanent opening on the top of the front side
** no opening at the upper front side
** vertical opening on the upper front side with buttons or zipper
*** men&#x27;s shirts are usually buttoned on the right whereas women&#x27;s are usually buttoned on the left.

=== Neck ===
* with polo-neck
* with &quot;scoop&quot; neck
* with v-neck but no collar
* with plunging neck
* with open or tassel neck
* with collar
** windsor collar or spread collar – a dressier collar designed with a wide distance between points (the spread) to accommodate the windsor knot tie. The standard business collar.
** tab collar – a collar with two small fabric tabs that fasten together behind a tie to maintain collar spread.
** wing collar – best suited for the bow tie, often only worn for very formal occasions.
** straight collar – or point collar, a version of the windsor collar that is distinguished by a narrower spread to better accommodate the four-in-hand knot, pratt knot, and the half-windsor knot. A moderate dress collar.
** button-down collar – A collar with buttons that fasten the points or tips to a shirt. The most casual of collars worn with a tie.
** band collar – essentially the lower part of a normal collar, first used as the original collar to which a separate collarpiece was attached. Rarely seen in modern fashion. Also casual.

== Types of fabric ==
There are two main categories of fibres used: natural fibre and man-made fibre (synthetics or petroleum based). Some natural fibres are linen, the first used historically, hemp, cotton, the most used, ramie, wool, silk and more recently bamboo or soya. Some synthetic fibres are polyester, tencel, viscose, etc. Polyester mixed with cotton (poly-cotton) is often used. Fabrics for shirts are called shirtings. The four main weaves for shirtings are plain weave, oxford, twill and satin. Broadcloth, poplin and end-on-end are variations of the plain weave. After weaving, finishing can be applied to the fabric.

== Shirts and politics ==

In the 1920s and 1930s, fascists wore different coloured shirts:

* Black shirts were used by the Italian fascists, and in Britain, Finland and Germany and Croatia. 
* Brownshirts were worn by German Nazis of the SA.
* The Blueshirts was a fascist movement in Ireland and Canada, and the colour of the Portuguese &quot;Nacional Sindicalistas&quot;, the Spanish &quot;Falange Española&quot;, the French &quot;Solidarité Française&quot;, and the Chinese Blue Shirts Society.
* Green shirts were used in Hungary, Ireland, Romania, Brazil and Portugal.
* &quot;Camisas Doradas&quot; (golden shirts) were used in Mexico.
* Red shirts were worn by the racist and antisemitic Bulgarian Ratniks.
* Silver Shirts were worn in the United States of America.
* Grey shirts were worn by members of the Fatherland League in Norway.

In addition, red shirts have been used to symbolize a variety of different political groups, including Garibaldi&#x27;s Italian revolutionaries, nineteenth-century American street gangs, and socialist militias in Spain and Mexico during the 1930s.

Different colored shirts signified the major opposing sides that featured prominently in the 2008 Thai political crisis, with red having been worn by the supporters of the populist People&#x27;s Power Party (PPP), and yellow being worn by the supporters of the royalist and anti-Thaksin Shinawatra movement the People&#x27;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD). Each side is commonly referred to as the &#x27;red shirts&#x27; and &#x27;yellow shirts&#x27; respectively, though the later opponents of the later Thaksin supporting groups have largely ceased wearing yellow shirts to protest rallies.

In the UK, the Social Credit movement of the thirties wore green shirts.

The party leaders of Dravidar Kazhagam in India wear only black shirts to symbolise atheism.

Whatever its color, the shirt itself means a certain wealth and social status. In Spain in the 19th century, then in Argentina during the time of Juan Perón, the word &quot;descamisados&quot; (&quot;shirtless&quot;) means the masses of the poor.

<text>Pat Rabbitte (born 18 May 1949) is an Irish former Labour Party politician who served as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources from 2011 to 2014, Leader of the Labour Party from 2002 to 2007 and a Minister of State from 1994 to 1997. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin South-West constituency from 1989 to 2016.

==Early life==
Patrick Rabbitte was born near Claremorris in 1949, and was brought up in Woodstock, Ballindine, County Mayo. He was educated locally at St Colman&#x27;s College, Claremorris before emigrating to Britain to find employment. He returned shortly afterward to attend University College Galway (UCG) where he studied Arts and Law. Whilst at university, Rabbitte became involved in several college movements before serving as President of the UCG Students&#x27; Union in 1970–1971. He achieved national attention while serving, between 1972 and 1974, as President of the national Union of Students in Ireland (USI). Following the completion of his presidency in 1974, he became an official in the Irish Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union (ITGWU), becoming National Secretary for the union in 1980.

Rabbitte became involved in electoral politics for the first time in late 1982, when he unsuccessfully contested Dublin South-West for the Workers&#x27; Party (WP) at the November general election. He was elected to Dublin County Council in 1985. Having again failed in election at the 1987 general election, though with a greatly improved performance in the same constituency, he finally entered Dáil Éireann as a Teachta Dála (TD) for Dublin South-West at the 1989 election. He retained his seat at every subsequent election until his retirement in 2016—for the first two as a Democratic Left TD, and for subsequent ones representing the Labour Party.

After Tomás Mac Giolla&#x27;s retirement as President of the WP in 1988, Rabbitte was seen as one of those who wanted to move the party away from its hard left position, and from its alignment with the Soviet Union and international communist and workers&#x27; parties. He and some others who had come from the USI via the trade union movement were seen as wanting to bring the WP toward the centre. This led Rabbitte, Eamon Gilmore and others to earn the nickname &quot;The Student Princes&quot;. In 1992, Rabbitte played a prominent role with Proinsias De Rossa in an attempt to jettison some of the party&#x27;s more hard-left positions. This eventually split the WP. Six of the seven TDs, including Rabbitte, joined Democratic Left.

==Junior Minister: 1994–1997==
In 1994, a new Rainbow Coalition government of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left came to office midway through the Dáil term. Rabbitte was appointed as Minister of State to the Government, as well as Minister at the Department of Enterprise and Employment with responsibility for Commerce, Science and Technology. He attended cabinet meetings, but without a vote. During his tenure as a junior minister, Rabbitte was involved in establishing an anti-drugs strategy as well as enacting legislation which gave the credit union movement more authority. Rabbitte also decided to locate the proposed new state-backed Technology Campus for West Dublin, based on high-speed telecommunication links, at CityWest Business Campus beside the N7 motorway, near Clondalkin.

==Labour Party leader and aftermath==
Following the 1997 general election the Rainbow Coalition lost office. In 1999, Democratic Left merged with the Labour Party, with Rabbitte participating in the negotiations. In October 2002 Rabbitte succeeded Ruairi Quinn as leader of the Labour Party. Under his leadership the party made some gains in the 2004 local elections. Rabbitte has been described as an extremely good performer in the Dáil, often outshining his Fine Gael counterpart Enda Kenny. He was also noted for his anti-Fianna Fáil rhetoric.

Under Rabbitte the Labour Party agreed to enter a pre-election pact with Fine Gael in an attempt to offer the electorate an alternative coalition government at the 2007 general election, which took place in May 2007. This was commonly known as The Mullingar Accord and the proposed alternative government was called the Alliance for Change. The Green Party were also anticipated to be likely members of the coalition government on the basis of agreed points of view on many issues covered by the Mullingar Accord.

The election result did not return a sufficient number of seats for the Alliance for Change to occupy government, even with the support of the Green Party. Rabbitte himself commented on the election result: &quot;This leaves Mr. Ahern in the driving seat&quot;. Negotiations between Fianna Fáil and the Green Party resulted in a Fianna Fáil leader Bertie Ahern forming a new government on 13 June 2007.

Following the disappointing result in the election for Labour, Rabbitte announced he was stepping down as leader on 23 August 2007. In his resignation statement, he took responsibility for the outcome of the recent general election, in which his party failed to gain new seats and failed to replace the outgoing government. He was succeeded as party leader by Eamon Gilmore.

Rabbitte gained public attention on 18 November 2010 when he angrily criticised the Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, Pat Carey, when they appeared together on &quot;Prime Time&quot;. An online recording of the outburst was viewed 100,000 times in its first three days there.

Rabbitte was re-elected on the first count in the 2011 general election. His running mate Eamonn Maloney was also elected.

===Ministerial career: 2011–2014===

On 9 March 2011, Rabbitte was appointed Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.

The journalist Fintan O&#x27;Toole, writing in &quot;The Irish Times&quot; in August 2011, criticised the lack of royalties system for gas and oil in Ireland. He claimed: &quot;The State is about to sign away almost all our resources on terms by far the worst in the developed world&quot;. Rabbitte responded with a letter, claiming that the article was inaccurate. Rabbitte&#x27;s response was in turn criticised by Cian O&#x27;Callaghan, a Labour Party member of Fingal County Council, as &quot;misguided&quot;.

In July 2014, Rabbitte was replaced by Alex White as part of a reshuffle of the cabinet. He did not contest the 2016 general election.

<doc id="264120" wikidata="Q467625" url="?curid=264120" title="Mary Harney">
<text>Mary Harney (born 11 March 1953) is an Irish former politician and the former Chancellor of the University of Limerick.

She was leader of the Progressive Democrats party between 1993 and 2006 and again from 2007 to 2008, resuming the role after her successor, Michael McDowell, lost his seat at the 2007 general election. She is the second longest-ever-serving female member of Dáil Éireann, serving as a Teachta Dála (TD) successively for the Dublin South-West and Dublin Mid-West constituencies from 1981 to 2011.

She was Ireland&#x27;s first female Tánaiste from 1997 to 2006, and the first woman to lead a party in Dáil Éireann.

==Early life and education==
Harney was born in Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, County Galway, in 1953. Her parents, who lived in nearby Ahascragh, were both farmers, but shortly after her birth her family moved to Newcastle, County Dublin. She was educated at the Convent of Mercy, Inchicore, and Presentation Convent, Clondalkin, before studying at Trinity College Dublin.

During her time in Trinity, she became the first female auditor (chair) of the College Historical Society. In 1976, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Economic and Social Studies, and for a brief time was a secondary school teacher at Castleknock College in Dublin.

==Political career: 1977–2011==

===Fianna Fáil: 1977–1985===
Harney came to the attention of Fianna Fáil leader Jack Lynch, and stood unsuccessfully as a Fianna Fáil candidate in the 1977 general election. She was then appointed to Seanad Éireann by Lynch who had become Taoiseach. She was the youngest ever member of the Seanad when appointed, aged 24.

In 1979, Harney had her first electoral success when she was elected to Dublin County Council. Two years later she was elected to the Dáil at the 1981 general election for Dublin South-West. She retained her seat at every election until her retirement in 2011, moving to the new Dublin Mid-West constituency at the 2002 general election when it was created from part of Dublin South-West.

After the killers of gay man Declan Flynn received suspended sentences, Harney challenged then Minister for Justice Michael Noonan to seek the resignation of the judge.

As a member of the so-called Gang of 22, she was expelled from the party after voting in favour of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985.

===Foundation of Progressive Democrats: 1985–1997===
Harney went on to become a founder member of the Progressive Democrats with Desmond O&#x27;Malley and Bobby Molloy in December 1985.

Following the 1989 general election the Progressive Democrats entered into a coalition government with Fianna Fáil, led at the time by Charles Haughey. Harney was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for Environmental Protection. As Minister of State she championed legislation to ban the sale of bituminous coal in Dublin, thereby eliminating smog from the city. She served in this position until the party withdrew from government in late 1992. In February 1993, Harney was appointed deputy leader of the Progressive Democrats, and succeeded O&#x27;Malley as party leader in October of that year, making her the first female leader of an Irish political party in Dáil Eireann.

===Return to coalition with Fianna Fáil: 1997–2004===
Following the 1997 general election and lengthy negotiations, the Progressive Democrats entered into coalition government with Fianna Fáil. Harney was appointed the first female Tánaiste and first female Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Harney used her powers to initiate thirteen investigations into companies which tribunals had suggested might have breached company law. After the 2002 general election Harney led the Progressive Democrats, who had doubled their seats from four to eight, back into coalition with Fianna Fáil, the first time a government had been re-elected since 1969. She was re-appointed Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. She inaugurated the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) in May 2004, to reduce high litigation costs in personal injuries cases and to compensate claimants quickly and cheaply. This was a major reform of the insurance market long opposed by the legal profession.

Harney was Ireland&#x27;s representative to the European Council of Ministers for the Software Patents Directive. Because the council&#x27;s first reading fell during the Irish Presidency of the European Council, she was chair of the meeting that discarded the amendments by the European Parliament which confirmed the exclusion of software innovations from what constitutes patentable subject matter.

In December 2001, Harney controversially used an Air Corps aircraft to travel to County Leitrim to open a friend&#x27;s off-licence in Manorhamilton; the trip cost €1,500. Harney later apologised for having abused her position in using the plane for non-government business, and admitted that using the plane was wrong. The aircraft was to be used 90% of the time exclusively for maritime surveillance.

===Minister for Health and Children: 2004–2011===
In a government reshuffle on 29 September 2004, Harney was appointed Minister for Health and Children.

In May 2006, the Irish Nurses Organisation unanimously passed a motion of no confidence in Mary Harney, accusing her of being negative and antagonistic towards nurses. Her policy of transferring private beds in public hospitals to privately operated hospitals also attracted criticism.

In March 2006, 16 months after she took office as health minister, the INO claimed that a record number of 455 people were waiting on hospital trolleys on one day (although the Health Service Executive gave a figure of 363 people waiting on hospital trolleys for the same day). In June 2006 the Health Consumer Powerhouse ranked the Irish health service as the second-least-&quot;consumer-friendly&quot; in the European Union and Switzerland, coming 25th out of 26 countries, ahead of only Lithuania. However, when the same survey was conducted a year later, the Irish health service showed significant improvement, coming 16th out of 29 countries, even scoring higher than Britain&#x27;s NHS, which came 17th in the survey.

In July 2006, &quot;Ireland on Sunday&quot; reported that Mary Harney&#x27;s mother, Sarah Harney, jumped a queue of two emergency cases to receive hip surgery at The Adelaide and Meath Hospital in Tallaght. The allegation was strongly denied by the minister. Sixty percent of respondents to a &quot;The Irish Times&quot;/TNS mrbi poll in December 2006 said that the appointment of Harney to the position of Minister for Health had not led to any improvement in the health service. Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Harney&#x27;s own Progressive Democrats supporters were those who expressed most satisfaction, with people in Dublin also feeling most dissatisfaction regionally. Harney rejected criticisms from Fine Gael during the same month that there had been a 25% increase in people waiting on trolleys in regional hospitals during the past two years; she claimed Health Service Executive statistics showed otherwise.

In July and August 2006, she issued three orders exempting two new community nursing units, to be built at St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital in the Phoenix Park, from the usual legal requirement of planning permission, despite the Park being a designated and protected national monument. The Department of Health said the decision was made because of what it called the department&#x27;s &quot;emergency response to the accident and emergency crisis at the time&quot;, although the nursing units, in use since 2008, are mainly for geriatric care.

The same year, in her capacity as Minister for Health, Mary Harney introduced risk equalisation into the Irish healthcare market. This was hugely resisted by BUPA. Despite High Court proceedings, the controversial change was upheld. This forced BUPA out of the Irish healthcare market. (BUPA Ireland was afterwards bought by the Irish-owned Quinn Group, averting any fear of redundancies.) In January 2007 a leaked memo said that the planned Cancer Care Strategy, due for completion in 2011, would not be delivered on time. Harney denied this and said that since the leaking of the memo there had been much progress, although she did not elaborate. The plan was to allow for nationwide radiotherapy services by 2011.

===Resignation and return as party leader: 2006–2008===
On 7 September 2006, Mary Harney announced that she was resigning as leader of the Progressive Democrats and that she would remain leader until a successor was chosen. She said she wanted to continue as Minister for Health but stated that it was a matter for her successor and the Taoiseach. She was succeeded by then-Justice Minister Michael McDowell after Tom Parlon and backbencher Liz O&#x27;Donnell nominated him. Parlon became party president and O&#x27;Donnell Deputy Leader in an agreement with McDowell after much speculation that the pair would also seek the leadership.

Following the poor performance of the Progressive Democrats at the 2007 general election, in which the party lost six of its eight seats including that of party leader Michael McDowell, Harney resumed her role as party leader. The Progressive Democrats&#x27; rules at the time stipulated that the leader of the party must be a TD, and Harney was one of only two remaining TDs; she resumed the leadership in a caretaker capacity. Following a rule change that broadened the eligibility, she was succeeded by Senator Ciarán Cannon as party leader on 17 April 2008.

===Independent TD: 2008–2011===
When the Progressive Democrats voted to disband in November 2008, Harney said she would remain as an independent TD once the party was wound up.

===Resignation as minister and retirement from Dáil: 2011===
On 15 January 2011, Harney tendered her resignation as Minister for Health and Children to Taoiseach Brian Cowen. She also stated that she would not be contesting the 2011 general election.

==Criticisms==
Alongside her predecessor at the Department of Health, Micheál Martin, and officials at two prominent Dublin fertility clinics, she received a package which included a threatening letter on 29 February 2008.

Councillor Louise Minihan, a member of Dublin City Council, threw red paint over Harney on 1 November 2010 as Harney turned the sod on a new health centre beside the Cherry Orchard Hospital in Ballyfermot. Minihan was detained but later released.

On 12 November 2010, Harney&#x27;s ministerial car was pelted with eggs and cheese as she arrived in Nenagh, with protesters referring to the &quot;ongoing downgrading of the [local] hospital&quot;.

===FÁS expenses scandal===

In 2004 she travelled to Florida with senior FÁS executives, department officials, and her husband, Brian Geoghegan, and was receiving more than €100-a-day subsistence money from the taxpayer when FÁS picked up her hairdressing bill in a Florida hotel. Like all government ministers travelling abroad, she was entitled to a daily allowance for &quot;incidental expenses&quot;.

In a RTÉ Radio 1 interview on 27 November 2008, Fianna Fáil TD Mary O&#x27;Rourke described Harney&#x27;s involvement in the scandal as &quot;a load of hoo-hah&quot;.

On 28 November 2008, Harney defended her use of expenses while on a FÁS trip to the US, saying that she was &quot;not on holiday&quot;, she had not used public taxes for her own personal grooming, that the use of the government jet for the trip was made by the Taoiseach, and she had followed advice in claiming her expenses. She acknowledged meeting a relative for an hour while in the United States. Labour Party leader Eamon Gilmore told his party conference that Harney should resign because of her performance as Minister for Health.

===Libel cases===
In 2002, Harney settled a libel case with &quot;Magill&quot; magazine for around €25,000, and in 2004 she settled a case against the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; for €70,000. In May 2011, she received a €450,000 in compensation from Newstalk radio for a slur made about her on live air by journalist Nell McCafferty.

==Post-politics==
===Board memberships===
In 2012, Harney joined the board of a new healthcare company, Cara. In her first interview since leaving office, Harney said she joined the boards of two Irish &#x27;high-potential&#x27; start-ups, Cara Health and Ward Biotech. She was also employed in speaking engagements, saying: &quot;I spoke at a recent surgeons&#x27; conference in New York on my experience as a health minister and in Berlin on the Irish pharma sector.&quot; In April 2012 Harney joined the board of car fleet insurer Euro Insurances, an Irish subsidiary of Dutch leasing giant Leaseplan. Indian pharma businessman Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, appointed Harney to the board of Biocon, a Bangalore-based company employing 7,000 and expanding in Malaysia.

===2016 address===
On 17 April 2016, Harney intervened in government formation talks, claiming the deadlock would damage &quot;Ireland&#x27;s reputation&quot; in remarks made during her closing address at the three-day Women in Media conference in Ballybunion. In the same address Harney, who attended with husband Brian Geogheghan, claimed that &quot;when she left public life she made a conscious decision to leave politics behind her&quot;.

==Recognition==
In 2019, Trinity College Dublin awarded Harney an honorary doctorate.

==Personal life==
In November 2001 Harney married Brian Geoghegan, a businessman, in a low-key afternoon ceremony in Dublin, on a day in which she attended to a number of significant political meetings.

<text>Ecodefense: A Field Guide to Monkeywrenching is a book edited by Dave Foreman (and Bill Haywood in later editions), with a foreword by Edward Abbey.

== Background ==
Much of the inspiration for the book, as well as the term &quot;monkeywrenching&quot;, came from Edward Abbey&#x27;s 1975 novel &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot;. Other inspiration for the book likely came from the 1972 book &quot;Ecotage!&quot;, which was published by the group Environmental Action and was in turn inspired by the actions of an activist in the Chicago, Illinois area who called himself &quot;The Fox&quot;, and engaged in such vigilante actions to protect the environment as plugging smokestacks. The Fox named after the Fox River northwest of Chicago was an avid historical boater who educated and demonstrated Native American and early trapper fishing and boating techniques.

The Fox was radicalized and became a founding mentor of the Earth Liberation Front movement after witnessing toxic dumping into the Fox River over decades which polluted the river to near-death. The Fox became infamous after dumping a bucket of said toxic waste upon the desk of a Stone Container Corporation executive in Chicago. The Fox was rumored also to plug drainage pipes from toxic industrial plants from his canoe along the Fox River. Much of the actual content for &quot;Ecodefense&quot; came from the &quot;Dear Ned Ludd&quot; column in the Earth First! newsletter during the 1980s.

This book was banned in Australia, gazetted in 1992 as &quot;refused classification&quot; and a prohibited import.

== Publication history ==
Ned Ludd Books published the first edition in 1985 and the second edition, revised and enlarged, in 1987. Abbzug Press in Chico, California published the third edition. Bill Haywood joined Dave Foreman as editor for the second and subsequent editions.

<text>Roman Yurievich Lyashenko (; May 1, 1979 – July 5, 2003) was a Russian ice hockey player. He played professionally in North America for the Dallas Stars and New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1999 to 2002, and also spent time with affiliate teams in the American Hockey League (Utah Grizzlies and Hartford Wolfpack) and the now-defunct International Hockey League (Michigan K-Wings). Lyashenko also played professionally in Russia for Torpedo Yaroslavl before joining the Stars. He was drafted by the Stars in the second round (52nd overall) of the 1997 NHL Entry Draft.

Lyashenko represented Russia internationally at both the junior and senior levels, capturing three medals (gold, silver and bronze) at the World Junior Championships and a silver medal at the World Championships. Lyashenko committed suicide while on vacation with his family on July 5, 2003.

==Playing career==
Lyashenko spent three seasons playing with Torpedo Yaroslavl in his home country of Russia. In 130 games, he recorded 22 goals and 22 assists for 44 points. While playing with Yaroslavl, he was selected in the second round (52nd overall) of the 1997 NHL Entry Draft by the Dallas Stars. Leading up to the draft, scouts described him as a defensive forward with good character and leadership skills. He was considered an atypical Russian prospect due to his attention to defensive play. One source had him ranked as a first round prospect. 
He signed with the Stars in July 1999.

Lyashenko made his NHL debut with the Dallas Stars during the 1999–2000 season, seeing action in 58 games, while recording six goals and six assists. He also spent time with the Stars&#x27; International Hockey League (IHL) affiliate Michigan K-Wings, notching five points in nine games. During his rookie season in the NHL, Lyashenko played center on the Stars second line, earning praise from coach Ken Hitchcock, &quot;His game has risen beyond his years. He&#x27;s 20 years old in age only. He looks like a real good fit for us.&quot; The Stars went to the Stanley Cup Finals that season, but lost to the New Jersey Devils. In the Stars&#x27; first round playoff series against the Edmonton Oilers, Lyashenko scored the winning goal in the first game of the series. During the 2000 Western Conference final against the Colorado Avalanche, Lyashenko scored the series clinching goal in game seven. Lyashenko played in 16 playoff games for the Stars. During the playoffs in his rookie season, Hitchcock was happy with Lyashenko&#x27;s play, saying, &quot;He&#x27;s an exceptional defensive player -- his offensive skills have improved as the season&#x27;s gone on.&quot;

During the 2000–2001 season, Lyashenko again split time between the Stars and the Utah Grizzlies, who were the Stars&#x27; new IHL affiliate. At the end of the season, Lyashenko had played 60 games with the Stars and recorded nine points. At the IHL level, he played in six games and had one assist. Lyashenko was popular with his teammates in Dallas, at one point his teammates lobbied Hitchcock to get him more playing time.

On March 12, 2002, Lyashenko and Martin Ručinský were traded to the New York Rangers for Manny Malhotra and Barrett Heisten. During the 2001–2002 season, Lyashenko played for four different teams, the Stars and Rangers at the NHL level as well as the IHL&#x27;s Grizzlies, and the Hartford Wolfpack of the American Hockey League (AHL). In his last season of professional hockey, Lyashenko played two games with the Rangers, and 71 with the Wolfpack. He put up the best numbers of his career in North America, with 23 goals and 35 assists. He played in the 2003 AHL All-Star Game, despite having asked for a release midway through the season to return to Russia. The request was denied by the Rangers, but his agent, Todd Diamond, said there were other teams interested in the forward&#x27;s services; &quot;Several teams were interested in him because they knew he wasn&#x27;t a fourth-line guy.&quot;

==International play==



Lyashenko represented Russia internationally at both the junior and senior levels. His first experience with Russia&#x27;s junior team was at the 1997 World Junior Championships, recording three points in six games as Russia defeated the Czech Republic for the bronze medal. At the 1998 World Junior championships, Lyashenko again represented Russia, as the team captured a silver medal. In seven games at the tournament, he recorded three assists. Lyashenko captained Russia&#x27;s team at the 1999 World Junior Championships, which were held in Winnipeg. The Russian team captured the gold medal, defeating Canada in overtime. Lyashenko scored three goals and added two assists in seven games. With the gold medal, Lyashenko and teammate Mikhail Donika became the only two players to win a medal of each colour (gold, silver and bronze) at the World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.

Lyashenko played in a single tournament at the senior international level, representing Russia at the 2002 World Championships. He left his AHL team, the Hartford Wolf Pack, during their playoff run to join Russia at the tournament. Wolf Pack general manager Al Coates was disappointed to lose Lyashenko from his club, but understood the decision: &quot;Everyone wants to play for his country, and he shouldn&#x27;t be portrayed as a bad guy. He&#x27;s a good guy and a good player.&quot; In nine games, he recorded two assists and 14 penalty minutes. Russia captured a silver medal at the tournament after a shocking loss to Slovakia in the final.

==Death==
While on vacation in Antalya, Turkey with his mother and sister, Lyashenko was found dead in his hotel room the morning of July 6, 2003. His death was initially reported to be a suicide. Reports by Turkish police confirmed this, stating that Lyashenko had left a suicide note and attempted to cut his arms and wrists before hanging himself. A Turkish police officer, speaking anonymously, said that Lyashenko apologized for killing himself in the note. New York Rangers general manager Glen Sather said of Lyashenko, &quot;Roman was a quality individual who had a positive impact on everyone he touched, both on and off the ice.&quot; Dallas Stars general manager Doug Armstrong expressed similar sentiments: &quot;Roman was a quality young man who we were privileged to have in our organization for three years.&quot; Lyashenko was buried in Yaroslavl on July 12, 2003.

<text>Washington and Lee University (Washington and Lee or W&amp;L) is a private liberal arts college in Lexington, Virginia, United States. Established in 1749 as Augusta Academy, it is among the oldest institutions of higher learning in the US.

Washington and Lee&#x27;s 325-acre campus sits at the edge of Lexington and abuts the campus of the Virginia Military Institute in the Shenandoah Valley region between the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Allegheny Mountains. The institution consists of three academic units: the college itself; the Williams School of Commerce, Economics, and Politics; and the School of Law. It hosts 24 intercollegiate varsity athletic teams which compete as part of the Old Dominion Athletic Conference of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA Division III).

==History==
The classical school from which Washington and Lee descended was established in 1749 by Scots-Irish Presbyterian pioneers and soon named Augusta Academy, about north of its present location. In 1776, it was renamed Liberty Hall in a burst of revolutionary fervor. A number of prominent men from the area acted as its original trustees, including Andrew Lewis, Thomas Lewis, Sampson Mathews, Samuel McDowell, George Moffett, William Preston, and James Waddel. The academy moved to Lexington in 1780, when it was chartered as Liberty Hall Academy, and built its first facility near town in 1782. The academy granted its first bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1785.

Liberty Hall is said to have admitted its first African American student when John Chavis, a free black, enrolled in 1795. Chavis accomplished much in his life including fighting in the American Revolution, studying at both Liberty Hall and the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), becoming an ordained Presbyterian minister, and opening a school that instructed white and poor black students in North Carolina. He is believed to be the first black student to enroll in higher education in the United States, although he did not receive a degree. Washington and Lee enrolled its next African American student in 1966 in the law school.

In 1796, George Washington endowed the academy with $20,000 in the form of 100 shares of James River Canal stock, at the time one of the largest gifts ever given to an educational institution in the United States. The shares were originally a gift given to Washington by the Virginia General Assembly. Washington&#x27;s gift continues to provide nearly $1.87 a year toward every student&#x27;s tuition. The gift rescued Liberty Hall from near-certain insolvency. In gratitude, the trustees changed the school&#x27;s name to Washington Academy; in 1813 it was chartered as Washington College. An statue of George Washington, carved by Matthew Kahle and known as &quot;Old George&quot;, was placed atop Washington Hall on the historic Colonnade in 1844 in memory of Washington&#x27;s gift. The current statue is made of bronze; the original wooden statue was restored and now resides in the library.The campus took its current architectural form in the 1820s when a local merchant, &quot;Jockey&quot; John Robinson, an uneducated Irish immigrant, donated funds to build a central building. For the dedication celebration in 1824, Robinson supplied a huge barrel of whiskey, which he intended for the dignitaries in attendance. But according to a contemporary history, the rabble broke through the barriers and created pandemonium, which ended only when college officials demolished the whiskey barrel with an axe. A justice of the Virginia State Supreme Court, Alex. M. Harman, Jr. (&#x27;44 Law), re-created the episode in 1976 for the dedication of the new law school building by having several barrels of Scotch imported (without the unfortunate dénouement). Robinson also left his estate to Washington College. The estate included between 70 and 80 enslaved people. Until 1852, the institution benefited from their enslaved labor and, in some cases, from their sale. In 2014, Washington and Lee University joined such colleges as Harvard University, Brown University, the University of Virginia, and The College of William &amp; Mary in researching, acknowledging, and publicly regretting their participation in the institution of slavery.

During the Civil War, the students of Washington College raised the Confederate flag in support of Virginia&#x27;s secession. The students formed the Liberty Hall Volunteers, as part of the Stonewall Brigade under Confederate States Army general Stonewall Jackson and marched from Lexington. Later in the war, during Hunter&#x27;s Raid, Union Captain Henry A. du Pont refused to destroy the Colonnade due to its support of the statue of George Washington, &quot;Old George&quot;.

===Lee years===

In the Fall of 1865, Robert E. Lee, the former general of the Confederacy, accepted an offer to become president of Washington College. Despite suffering financial hardship at the time and having offers for several business opportunities, he said he chose to become the college president because he wanted to train &quot;young men to do their duty&quot;. (Lee believed that the business offers were meant primarily to trade on his name). During his tenure, Lee established the first journalism courses (which were limited and only lasted several years) and added engineering courses, a business school, and law school to the college curriculum, under the conviction that those occupations should be intimately and inextricably linked with the liberal arts. That was a radical idea: engineering, journalism, and law had always been considered technical crafts, not intellectual endeavors, and the study of business was viewed with skepticism.

Lee&#x27;s emphasis on student self-governance for Washington College remains the distinguishing character of the student-run Honor System today. And, ardent about restoring national unity, he successfully recruited white men as students from throughout the reunited nation, North and South.

However, it has been argued that one of Lee&#x27;s failings as president of Washington College was an apparent indifference to crimes of violence towards blacks committed by students at the college. Historian Elizabeth Brown Pryor notes that students at Washington College formed their own chapter of the KKK and were known by the local Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau to attempt to abduct and rape black schoolgirls from the nearby black schools. There were also at least two attempted lynchings by Washington students during Lee&#x27;s tenure. Yet Lee seemed to punish the racial harassment more laxly than he did more trivial offenses or turned a blind eye to it altogether.

Lee died on October 12, 1870, after five years as Washington College president. The college&#x27;s name was almost immediately changed to Washington and Lee University to honor Lee. On February 4, 1871, the name change was formalized by the Virginia General Assembly. The university&#x27;s motto, &quot;Nōn Incautus Futūrī&quot;&#x27;, meaning &quot;Not unmindful of the future&quot;, is an adaptation of the Lee family motto. Lee&#x27;s son, George Washington Custis Lee, followed his father as the institution&#x27;s president. Robert E. Lee and much of his family—including his wife, his seven children, and his parents, the Revolutionary War hero Major-General Henry &quot;Light-Horse Harry&quot; Lee and Anne Hill Carter Lee—are buried in University Chapel (formerly Lee Chapel) on campus, which faces the main row of antebellum college buildings. Robert E. Lee&#x27;s beloved horse Traveller is buried outside, near the wall of the chapel.

===20th century and beyond===
After Lee&#x27;s death, the institution continued his program of educational innovation, modernization, and expansion. In 1905, the board of trustees formally organized a School of Commerce in order to train students in business and finance alongside the college and the School of Law. In 1995, Ernest Williams II of the Class of 1938 endowed the School of Commerce which was renamed the Ernest Williams II School of Commerce, Economics, and Politics. Also in 1905, Andrew Carnegie donated $55,000 to the Washington and Lee for the erection of a new library.

Omicron Delta Kappa or ODK, a national honor society, was founded at Washington and Lee on December 3, 1914. For many years ODK&#x27;s annual convocation was held at the school in University Chapel on or about Robert E. Lee&#x27;s birthday, January 19, in conjunction with a board of trustees-mandated holiday/Lee commemoration called &quot;Founders Day&quot;, a version of the Robert E. Lee Day birthday holiday still officially celebrated in a few southern states. (The board of trustees announced the discontinuation of &quot;Founders Day&quot; on June 4, 2021.) ODK Chapters, known as Circles, are located on over 300 college campuses. The society recognizes achievement in the five areas of scholarship; athletics; campus/community service, social/religious activities, and campus government; journalism, speech and the mass media; and creative and performing arts. ODK is a quasi-secret society with regard to the way in which its members are selected and kept secret for a period of time. Membership in the Omicron Delta Kappa Society is regarded as one of the highest collegiate honors that can be awarded to an individual, along with Phi Kappa Phi and Phi Beta Kappa. Some circles limit membership to less than the top one quarter of one percent of students on their respective campuses. Omicron Delta Kappa continues to maintain its headquarters in Lexington and is a major presence at W&amp;L.
During the first half of the 20th century, the institution began its traditions of the Fancy Dress Ball and Mock Convention. Both of these are still staples of the W&amp;L experience.The second half of the 20th century saw Washington and Lee move from being an all-men&#x27;s college to a co-ed institution. The School of Law enrolled its first women in 1972 and the undergraduate program enrolled its first woman in 1985. Washington and Lee built new buildings to house its science departments as well as a new School of Law facility. Further, W&amp;L successfully completed several multimillion-dollar capital campaigns.

Among many alumni who have followed in George Washington&#x27;s footsteps by donating generously, Rupert Johnson Jr., a 1962 graduate who is vice chairman of the $600 billion Franklin Templeton investment management firm, gave $100 million to Washington and Lee in June 2007, establishing a merit-based financial aid and curriculum-enrichment program.

In 2014, a large Confederate battle flag and a number of related state flags were removed from University Chapel, after a group of black students protested that the school was unwelcoming to minorities. In his letter, President Kenneth P. Ruscio publicly apologized for the school&#x27;s ownership of about 80 enslaved people during the period from 1826 to 1852, some of whom were forced to build a dormitory on campus.

Some students, faculty, and alumni have advocated that Washington and Lee disassociate itself from Lee, including advocating a change of name. Other students and alumni have defended the association with Lee. In July 2020, for the first time, faculty (by more than a three-quarters vote) and the executive committee of the Student Body called for Robert E. Lee&#x27;s name to be removed from the name of the institution. The board of trustees announced the formation of a committee to consider name-change, removing portraits of Lee from diplomas, and how names and symbols of Lee and confederates &quot;uphold slavery&quot; and &quot;abhorrent racist sentiment.&quot; On June 4, 2021, after 11 months of deliberation, the board voted 22–6 to keep the name.

==Campus==


The central core of the campus, including the row of brick buildings that form the Colonnade, are a designated National Historic Landmark District for their architecture. The University Chapel, separately designated a National Historic Landmark, is also a part of that district.

In 1926, the poet and dramatist John Drinkwater, author of &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; and other plays, wrote of W&amp;L, &quot;This Lexington university is one of the loveliest spots in the world.&quot; Jonathan W. Daniels, North Carolina author, newspaper editor and White House Press Secretary to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, wrote that it was &quot;the South at its most beautiful: the green sloping campus to the red-brick buildings with the tall white porticoes. ... I wish it were the picture of the South. I wish, indeed, it were the picture of America.&quot; Washington and Lee History Professor Ted DeLaney, who was born and grew up in Lexington during Jim Crow and spent more than 45 years of his 60-year career at W&amp;L, more than a quarter-century as a professor, including serving as the first Black chair of the History Department, said in 2019, &quot;W&amp;L is unique because the entire campus is a Confederate monument.&quot;

In recent years, Washington and Lee has invested heavily in upgrading and expanding its academic, residential, athletic, research, arts and extracurricular facilities. The new facilities include an undergraduate library, gymnasium, art/music/theater complex, dorms, student center, student activities pavilion and tennis pavilion, as well as renovation of the journalism and commerce buildings and renovation of every fraternity house and construction of several sorority houses. Lewis Hall, the 30-year-old home of the law school, as well as athletic fields and the antebellum Historic Front Campus buildings, are all currently undergoing major renovation.

Constructed in 1991, the Lenfest Center for the Arts has presented both performances from students and presentations that are open to the community. The Reeves Center houses a notable ceramics collection that spans 4,000 years and includes ceramics from Asia, Europe and America, and examples of Chinese export porcelain. The indoor athletics facility, Duchossois, is undergoing renovation and is scheduled to be reopened in fall 2020.

==Organization and administration==
The school is governed by a board of trustees that has a maximum of 34 members.

The undergraduate calendar is an unusual three-term system with 13-week fall and winter terms followed by a four-week spring term. The spring-term courses include topical, often unique, seminars, faculty-supervised study abroad, and some domestic and international internships. The law calendar consists of the more traditional early semester system.

===Honor system===
Washington and Lee maintains a rigorous honor system that dates from the 1840s. Students, upon entering the institution, vow to act honorably in all academic and nonacademic endeavors.

The honor system is administered by students through the executive committee of the Student Body (and has been since 1905). Students found guilty of an Honor Violation by their peers are subject to a single sanction: expulsion. The honor system is defined solely by students, and there is an appeal process. Appeals are heard by juries composed of students drawn randomly by the University Registrar. A formal assessment of the honor system&#x27;s &quot;White Book&quot;, occasionally including referendums, is held every three years to review the tenets of the honor system. Overwhelmingly, students continue to support the honor system and its single sanction, and they and alumni point to the honor system as one of the distinctive marks they carry with them from their W&amp;L experience.

Washington and Lee&#x27;s honor system does not have a list of rules that define punishable behavior—beyond the traditional guide of the offenses lying, cheating or stealing. Exams at W&amp;L are ordinarily unproctored and self-scheduled. It is not unusual for professors to assign take-home, closed-book finals with an explicit trust in their students not to cheat.

The honor system is strongly enforced. In most years, only a few students withdraw in the face of an honor charge or after investigations and closed hearings conducted by the executive committee of the Student Body, the elected student government (with the accused counseled by Honor Advocates, often law students). In recent years, four or five students have left each year. Students found guilty in a closed hearing may appeal the verdict to an open hearing before the entire student body, although this option is rarely exercised. If found guilty at an open trial, the student is dismissed permanently.

Separately from the student-run honor system, the Student Judicial Council and the Student-Faculty Hearing Board hear allegations of student misconduct.

===Rankings and reputation===
In the 2025 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings, the undergraduate college is tied for 19th among national liberal arts colleges and 14th among Best Value Schools, and the law school is ranked tied for 33rd nationally among all law schools. &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine college rankings placed W&amp;L 47th among the top 500 universities, liberal arts colleges, and service academies for their 2024-25 list. &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; ranked Washington and Lee 1st among 214 liberal arts colleges in the U.S. based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service. In 2023, &quot;Degreechoices&quot; ranked Washington and Lee 3rd out of 209 liberal arts colleges and 14th for business.

&quot;Kiplinger&#x27;s Personal Finance&quot; ranked the college 3rd in its 2019 list of 149 best private liberal arts college values and 6th overall among 500 colleges and universities. In 2015, &quot;The Economist&quot; ranked Washington and Lee first among all undergraduate institutions in the United States in terms of the positive gap between its students&#x27; actual median earnings ten years from graduation and what the publication&#x27;s statistical model would suggest. Of its findings, the newspaper wrote that &quot;No other college combines the intimate academic setting and broad curriculum of a LAC [liberal arts college] with a potent old-boy network.&quot;

===Organization===
Washington and Lee is divided into three schools: (1) The College, where all undergraduates begin their studies, encompassing the liberal arts, humanities and hard sciences, with notable interest among students in pre-health and pre-law studies; (2) the Williams School of Commerce, Economics, and Politics, which offers majors in accounting, business administration, economics, and politics; and (3) the School of Law, which offers the Juris Doctor degree.

More than 800 undergraduate courses are offered. With no graduate program (except in law), every course is taught by a faculty member. The libraries contain more than 700,000 volumes as well as a vast electronic network. The law library has an additional 400,000 volumes as well as extensive electronic resources.

Washington and Lee offers 40 undergraduate majors (including interdisciplinary majors in neuroscience, Medieval and Renaissance studies, and Russian area studies) and 30 minors, including interdisciplinary programs in Africana studies, East Asian studies, Education and Education policy, environmental studies, Latin American &amp; Caribbean studies, Middle East and South Asian studies, poverty and human capability studies (Shepherd Program), and women&#x27;s, gender, and sexuality studies. Its most popular undergraduate majors, based on 2021 graduates, were:
*Business Administration and Management (90)
*Economics (49)
*Accounting (45)
*Political Science and Government (35)
*Research and Experimental Psychology (24)
*History (21)

Though Washington and Lee has refused since 2003 to submit data to The Princeton Review, the 2006 edition of &quot;The Best 357 Colleges&quot; ranked W&amp;L highly for &quot;Best Overall Academic Experience&quot;, &quot;Professors Get High Marks&quot;, and &quot;Professor Accessibility&quot;. In the 2007 edition, Washington and Lee was ranked fourth in &quot;Professors Get High Marks&quot; and sixth in &quot;Professor Accessibility&quot;. Combining academics with an active social culture, Washington and Lee ranked 14th in &quot;Best Overall Academic Experience for Undergraduates&quot;.

Washington and Lee University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

==Student life==
The institution has 1829 students . The median family income is $261,100, with 55% of students coming from the top 5% highest-earning families, 8% from the bottom 60%, and 1.5% from the bottom 20% (among the lowest of any U.S. college or university). 82% of students are white, 4.5% are Hispanic, 3.4% are Asian, and 2.2% are Black.

===Athletics===

The school&#x27;s teams are known as &quot;The Generals&quot; and compete in NCAA Division III in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference and the Centennial Conference for wrestling. Washington and Lee has 12 men&#x27;s teams (baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, tennis, indoor and outdoor track &amp; field, and wrestling) and 12 women&#x27;s teams (basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, riding, soccer, swimming, tennis, indoor and outdoor track &amp; field, and volleyball). Washington and Lee holds two NCAA National Championship team titles. In 1988, the men&#x27;s tennis team won the NCAA Division III National Championship title and holds 35 ODAC championships. In 2007, the women&#x27;s tennis team claimed the NCAA Division III National Championship title. In 2018, the men&#x27;s golf team finished as runner-up in the NCAA Division III championship. In 2006, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2015, the Generals football team won the Old Dominion Athletic Conference championship. In 2009, the Generals baseball team won the ODAC championship.

Athletic exclusion was manifest in the early 20th century, when the school forced Rutgers to sit out star African American football player Paul Robeson for a 1916 football game and later forfeited a 1923 game when Washington and Jefferson refused to comply with a similar demand.

===Student activities===

====Traditions====
Every four years, the school sponsors the Washington and Lee Mock Convention for whichever political party (Democratic or Republican) does not hold the presidency. The convention has received gavel-to-gavel coverage on C-SPAN and attention from many other national media outlets. The convention has correctly picked the out-of-power nominee for 20 of the past 27 national elections. It has been wrong three times since 1948, including its incorrect choice of Bernie Sanders in 2020. In 1984, the failure of the scoreboard significantly slowed the vote tally process and almost led to a wrong selection. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; declared Washington and Lee&#x27;s Mock Convention &quot;one of the nation&#x27;s oldest and most prestigious mock conventions.&quot;

The school also hosts an annual Fancy Dress Ball, a 117-year-old formal black-tie event started in 1907. It is put on by a committee of students appointed by the executive committee. The committee is responsible each year to create a theme and handle the logistics of setting up the Fancy Dress Ball. The Fancy Dress Ball has a budget of over $80,000.

Washington and Lee University also follows the &quot;speaking tradition&quot; which traces its history to Robert E. Lee. Under this tradition, students are suggested to greet one another upon passing on campus. This tradition is not enforced.

===Fraternities and sororities===
Greek letter organizations play a major role in Washington and Lee&#x27;s social scene. The university has several houses of fraternities and sororities.

===Media and culture===
The eminent photographer Sally Mann got her start at Washington and Lee, photographing the construction of the law school while an employee. The photos eventually became the basis of a one-woman exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C.
Secretariat, who holds the record for the fastest time in the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, and Belmont Stakes, and the winner of the Triple Crown in 1973, wore royal blue and white (as shown in the 2010 film) because his co-owner, Christopher Chenery, was a graduate and trustee of Washington and Lee.

Alumnus George William Crump, while a student (in 1804) at Washington College (predecessor to Washington and Lee University) circa 1800 to 1804, was arrested for running naked through Lexington, Virginia: it was the United States&#x27; first recorded incident of streaking. Crump is better known as member of the United States House of Representatives in the 19th United States Congress and the U.S. Ambassador to Chile.

A Washington and Lee art history professor, Pamela Hemenway Simpson, in 1999 wrote the first scholarly book on linoleum, giving it the title &quot;Cheap, Quick and Easy&quot;. The book also examines other lower-cost home-design materials.

Washington and Lee is home to a collection of 18th- and 19th-century Chinese and European porcelain, the gift of Euchlin Dalcho Reeves, a 1927 graduate of the law school, and his wife, Louise Herreshoff. In 1967, Reeves contacted Washington and Lee about making &quot;a small gift&quot;, which turned out to be a collection of porcelain so vast that it filled two entire houses which he and his wife owned in Providence, Rhode Island. A number of dirt-covered picture frames, found in the two houses, were put on the van along with the porcelain. Soon it was discovered that the frames actually contained Impressionist-like paintings created by Herreshoff as a young woman in the early days of the century. In 1976 the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C., mounted a posthumous one-woman exhibition of Herreshoff&#x27;s works.

===Music===
Before it morphed into a swing, Dixieland and bluegrass standard, &quot;The Washington and Lee Swing&quot; was one of the most well known—and widely borrowed—football marches ever written, according to Robert Lissauer&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music in America.&quot; Schools and colleges from Tulane to Slippery Rock copied it (sometimes with attribution). It was written in 1910 by Mark W. Sheafe, &#x27;06, Clarence A. (Tod) Robbins, &#x27;11, and Thornton W. Allen, &#x27;13. It has been recorded by virtually every important jazz and swing musician, including Glenn Miller (with Tex Beneke on vocals), Louis Armstrong, Kay Kyser, Hal Kemp and the Dukes of Dixieland. &quot;The Swing&quot; was a trademark of the New Orleans showman Pete Fountain. The trumpeter Red Nichols played it (and Danny Kaye pretended to play it) in the 1959 movie &quot;The Five Pennies&quot;. (Here is an audio excerpt from a 1944 recording by Jan Garber, a prominent dance-band leader of the era. Here is an exuberant instrumental version by a group called the Dixie Boys, which YouTube dates to 2006.)

==Notable alumni==

Washington and Lee University is the alma mater of three United States Supreme Court justices, a Nobel Prize laureate, winners of the Pulitzer Prize, the Tony Award, and the Emmy Award, as well as 27 U.S. senators, 67 U.S. representatives, 31 state governors, as well as numerous other government officials, judges, business leaders, entertainers, and athletes.

Several well-known alumni include past American Bar Association President Linda Klein (School of Law), Utah Governor Spencer Cox (School of Law), Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin, Virginia Governor Linwood Holton, United States Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr.; United States Senator John Warner from Virginia; United States Solicitor General John W. Davis, Democratic Party nominee for President of the United States during the 1924 presidential election; author Tom Wolfe, founder of New Journalism; broadcast journalist Roger Mudd; Anglican bishop Steve Breedlove; artist Cy Twombly; voice actor Mike Henry; Federal Judge and Civil Rights champion John Minor Wisdom; billionaire Rupert Johnson Jr. of Franklin Templeton Investments; financial journalist, and non-fiction writer Mary Childs and Mark Sappenfield, editor-in-chief of The Christian Science Monitor.

Archives of the papers of notable alumni and other resources relating to the history of the institution may be found in the manuscript collections at Washington and Lee&#x27;s James Graham Leyburn Library. Publication of the 1995 guide to the collections was made possible by a grant from the Jessie Ball DuPont Fund.

==In literature==
A fictionalized representation of the institution appears in &quot;L&#x27;Étudiant étranger&quot; by Philippe Labro (1986, Editions Gallimard), translated into English two years later and published as &quot;The Foreign Student&quot; (Ballantine Books). In 1994 it was made into a movie, starring Robin Givens and Marco Hofschneider, but it grossed only $113,000 at the box office.

Other novels about Washington and Lee University include &quot;Geese in the Forum&quot; (Knopf, 1940) by Lawrence Edward Watkin, a professor of English who went on to become a screenwriter for Disney (the college faculty were the titular geese); &quot;The Hero&quot; (Julian Messner, 1949), by Millard Lampell, filmed as &quot;Saturday&#x27;s Hero,&quot; starring Donna Reed and John Derek (Columbia Studios, 1951), about a football player who struggles to balance athletics, academics and a social life; and &quot;A Sound of Voices Dying&quot; by Glenn Scott (E.P. Dutton, 1954), released in a paperback edition in 1955 under the new title &quot;Farewell My Young Lover&quot; (replete with a lurid illustration on the cover). The Russian-born American author Maxim D. Shrayer depicted a fictionalized version of the Washington &amp; Lee campus in the story &quot;Trout Fishing in Virginia&quot; (2007), included in his collection &quot;Yom Kippur in Amsterdam&quot; (2009).

<text>In abstract algebra and analysis, the Archimedean property, named after the ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes of Syracuse, is a property held by some algebraic structures, such as ordered or normed groups, and fields. 
The property, as typically construed, states that given two positive numbers formula_1 and formula_2, there is an integer formula_3 such that formula_4. It also means that the set of natural numbers is not bounded above. Roughly speaking, it is the property of having no &quot;infinitely large&quot; or &quot;infinitely small&quot; elements. It was Otto Stolz who gave the axiom of Archimedes its name because it appears as Axiom V of Archimedes’ &quot;On the Sphere and Cylinder&quot;.

The notion arose from the theory of magnitudes of ancient Greece; it still plays an important role in modern mathematics such as David Hilbert&#x27;s axioms for geometry, and the theories of ordered groups, ordered fields, and local fields.

An algebraic structure in which any two non-zero elements are &quot;comparable&quot;, in the sense that neither of them is infinitesimal with respect to the other, is said to be Archimedean. 
A structure which has a pair of non-zero elements, one of which is infinitesimal with respect to the other, is said to be non-Archimedean. 
For example, a linearly ordered group that is Archimedean is an Archimedean group.

This can be made precise in various contexts with slightly different formulations. 
For example, in the context of ordered fields, one has the axiom of Archimedes which formulates this property, where the field of real numbers is Archimedean, but that of rational functions in real coefficients is not.

== History and origin of the name of the Archimedean property ==

The concept was named by Otto Stolz (in the 1880s) after the ancient Greek geometer and physicist Archimedes of Syracuse.

The Archimedean property appears in Book V of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; as Definition 4:

Because Archimedes credited it to Eudoxus of Cnidus it is also known as the &quot;Theorem of Eudoxus&quot; or the &quot;Eudoxus axiom&quot;.

Archimedes used infinitesimals in heuristic arguments, although he denied that those were finished mathematical proofs.

== Definition for linearly ordered groups ==
Let and be positive elements of a linearly ordered group &quot;G&quot;. 
Then formula_1 is infinitesimal with respect to formula_2 (or equivalently, formula_2 is infinite with respect to formula_1) if, for any natural number formula_3, the multiple formula_10 is less than formula_2, that is, the following inequality holds:
formula_12

This definition can be extended to the entire group by taking absolute values.

The group formula_13 is Archimedean if there is no pair formula_14 such that formula_1 is infinitesimal with respect to formula_2.

Additionally, if formula_17 is an algebraic structure with a unit (1) — for example, a ring — a similar definition applies to formula_17. 
If formula_1 is infinitesimal with respect to formula_20, then formula_1 is an infinitesimal element. 
Likewise, if formula_2 is infinite with respect to formula_20, then formula_2 is an infinite element. 
The algebraic structure formula_17 is Archimedean if it has no infinite elements and no infinitesimal elements.

=== Ordered fields ===

Ordered fields have some additional properties:
* The rational numbers are embedded in any ordered field. That is, any ordered field has characteristic zero.
* If formula_1 is infinitesimal, then formula_27 is infinite, and vice versa. Therefore, to verify that a field is Archimedean it is enough to check only that there are no infinitesimal elements, or to check that there are no infinite elements.
* If formula_1 is infinitesimal and formula_29 is a rational number, then formula_30 is also infinitesimal. As a result, given a general element formula_31, the three numbers formula_32, formula_31, and formula_34 are either all infinitesimal or all non-infinitesimal.
In this setting, an ordered field is Archimedean precisely when the following statement, called the axiom of Archimedes, holds:
: &quot;Let formula_1 be any element of formula_17. Then there exists a natural number formula_3 such that formula_38.&quot;
Alternatively one can use the following characterization:
formula_39

== Definition for normed fields ==

The qualifier &quot;Archimedean&quot; is also formulated in the theory of rank one valued fields and normed spaces over rank one valued fields as follows. 
Let formula_17 be a field endowed with an absolute value function, i.e., a function which associates the real number formula_41 with the field element 0 and associates a positive real number formula_42 with each non-zero formula_43 and satisfies
formula_44 and formula_45. 
Then, formula_17 is said to be Archimedean if for any non-zero formula_43 there exists a natural number formula_3 such that
formula_49

Similarly, a normed space is Archimedean if a sum of formula_3 terms, each equal to a non-zero vector formula_1, has norm greater than one for sufficiently large formula_3. 
A field with an absolute value or a normed space is either Archimedean or satisfies the stronger condition, referred to as the ultrametric triangle inequality,
formula_53
respectively. 
A field or normed space satisfying the ultrametric triangle inequality is called non-Archimedean.

The concept of a non-Archimedean normed linear space was introduced by A. F. Monna.

== Examples and non-examples ==

=== Archimedean property of the real numbers ===

The field of the rational numbers can be assigned one of a number of absolute value functions, including the trivial function formula_54, when formula_55, the more usual formula_56, and the formula_57-adic absolute value functions. 
By Ostrowski&#x27;s theorem, every non-trivial absolute value on the rational numbers is equivalent to either the usual absolute value or some formula_57-adic absolute value. 
The rational field is not complete with respect to non-trivial absolute values; with respect to the trivial absolute value, the rational field is a discrete topological space, so complete. 
The completion with respect to the usual absolute value (from the order) is the field of real numbers. 
By this construction the field of real numbers is Archimedean both as an ordered field and as a normed field. 
On the other hand, the completions with respect to the other non-trivial absolute values give the fields of p-adic numbers, where formula_57 is a prime integer number (see below); since the formula_57-adic absolute values satisfy the ultrametric property, then the formula_57-adic number fields are non-Archimedean as normed fields (they cannot be made into ordered fields).

In the axiomatic theory of real numbers, the non-existence of nonzero infinitesimal real numbers is implied by the least upper bound property as follows. 
Denote by formula_62 the set consisting of all positive infinitesimals. 
This set is bounded above by formula_20. 
Now assume for a contradiction that formula_62 is nonempty. 
Then it has a least upper bound formula_31, which is also positive, so formula_66. 
Since is an upper bound of formula_62 and formula_34 is strictly larger than formula_31, formula_34 is not a positive infinitesimal. 
That is, there is some natural number formula_3 for which formula_72. 
On the other hand, formula_32 is a positive infinitesimal, since by the definition of least upper bound there must be an infinitesimal formula_1 between formula_32 and formula_31, and if formula_77 then formula_1 is not infinitesimal. 
But formula_79, so formula_32 is not infinitesimal, and this is a contradiction. 
This means that formula_62 is empty after all: there are no positive, infinitesimal real numbers.

The Archimedean property of real numbers holds also in constructive analysis, even though the least upper bound property may fail in that context.

=== Non-Archimedean ordered field ===
For an example of an ordered field that is not Archimedean, take the field of rational functions with real coefficients. 
(A rational function is any function that can be expressed as one polynomial divided by another polynomial; we will assume in what follows that this has been done in such a way that the leading coefficient of the denominator is positive.) 
To make this an ordered field, one must assign an ordering compatible with the addition and multiplication operations. 
Now formula_82 if and only if formula_83, so we only have to say which rational functions are considered positive. 
Call the function positive if the leading coefficient of the numerator is positive. (One must check that this ordering is well defined and compatible with addition and multiplication.) 
By this definition, the rational function formula_27 is positive but less than the rational function formula_20. 
In fact, if formula_3 is any natural number, then formula_87 is positive but still less than formula_20, no matter how big formula_3 is. 
Therefore, formula_27 is an infinitesimal in this field.

This example generalizes to other coefficients. 
Taking rational functions with rational instead of real coefficients produces a countable non-Archimedean ordered field. 
Taking the coefficients to be the rational functions in a different variable, say formula_2, produces an example with a different order type.

=== Non-Archimedean valued fields ===

The field of the rational numbers endowed with the p-adic metric and the p-adic number fields which are the completions, do not have the Archimedean property as fields with absolute values. 
All Archimedean valued fields are isometrically isomorphic to a subfield of the complex numbers with a power of the usual absolute value.

=== Equivalent definitions of Archimedean ordered field ===

Every linearly ordered field formula_17 contains (an isomorphic copy of) the rationals as an ordered subfield, namely the subfield generated by the multiplicative unit formula_20 of formula_17, which in turn contains the integers as an ordered subgroup, which contains the natural numbers as an ordered monoid. 
The embedding of the rationals then gives a way of speaking about the rationals, integers, and natural numbers in formula_17. 
The following are equivalent characterizations of Archimedean fields in terms of these substructures.

# The natural numbers are cofinal in formula_17. That is, every element of formula_17 is less than some natural number. (This is not the case when there exist infinite elements.) Thus an Archimedean field is one whose natural numbers grow without bound.
# Zero is the infimum in formula_17 of the set formula_99. (If formula_17 contained a positive infinitesimal it would be a lower bound for the set whence zero would not be the greatest lower bound.)
# The set of elements of formula_17 between the positive and negative rationals is non-open. This is because the set consists of all the infinitesimals, which is just the set formula_102 when there are no nonzero infinitesimals, and otherwise is open, there being neither a least nor greatest nonzero infinitesimal. Observe that in both cases, the set of infinitesimals is closed. In the latter case, (i) every infinitesimal is less than every positive rational, (ii) there is neither a greatest infinitesimal nor a least positive rational, and (iii) there is nothing else in between. Consequently, any non-Archimedean ordered field is both incomplete and disconnected.
# For any formula_1 in formula_17 the set of integers greater than formula_1 has a least element. (If formula_1 were a negative infinite quantity every integer would be greater than it.)
# Every nonempty open interval of formula_17 contains a rational. (If formula_1 is a positive infinitesimal, the open interval formula_109 contains infinitely many infinitesimals but not a single rational.)
# The rationals are dense in formula_17 with respect to both sup and inf. (That is, every element of formula_17 is the sup of some set of rationals, and the inf of some other set of rationals.) Thus an Archimedean field is any dense ordered extension of the rationals, in the sense of any ordered field that densely embeds its rational elements.

<text>In abstract algebra, a branch of mathematics, an Archimedean group is a linearly ordered group for which the Archimedean property holds: every two positive group elements are bounded by integer multiples of each other. The set R of real numbers together with the operation of addition and the usual ordering relation between pairs of numbers is an Archimedean group. By a result of Otto Hölder, every Archimedean group is isomorphic to a subgroup of this group. The name &quot;Archimedean&quot; comes from Otto Stolz, who named the Archimedean property after its appearance in the works of Archimedes.

==Definition==
An additive group consists of a set of elements, an associative addition operation that combines pairs of elements and returns a single element,
an identity element (or zero element) whose sum with any other element is the other element, and an additive inverse operation such that the sum of any element and its inverse is zero.
A group is a linearly ordered group when, in addition, its elements can be linearly ordered in a way that is compatible with the group operation: for all elements &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot;, if &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; then &quot;x&quot; + &quot;z&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; + &quot;z&quot; and &quot;z&quot; + &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;z&quot; + &quot;y&quot;.

The notation &quot;na&quot; (where &quot;n&quot; is a natural number) stands for the group sum of &quot;n&quot; copies of &quot;a&quot;.
An Archimedean group (&quot;G&quot;, +, ≤) is a linearly ordered group subject to the following additional condition, the Archimedean property: For every &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; in &quot;G&quot; which are greater than 0, it is possible to find a natural number &quot;n&quot; for which the inequality &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;na&quot; holds.

An equivalent definition is that an Archimedean group is a linearly ordered group without any bounded cyclic subgroups: there does not exist a cyclic subgroup &quot;S&quot; and an element &quot;x&quot; with &quot;x&quot; greater than all elements in &quot;S&quot;. It is straightforward to see that this is equivalent to the other definition: the Archimedean property for a pair of elements &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; is just the statement that the cyclic subgroup generated by &quot;a&quot; is not bounded by &quot;b&quot;.

==Examples of Archimedean groups==
The sets of the integers, the rational numbers, and the real numbers, together with the operation of addition and the usual ordering (≤), are Archimedean groups. Every subgroup of an Archimedean group is itself Archimedean, so it follows that every subgroup of these groups, such as the additive group of the even numbers or of the dyadic rationals, also forms an Archimedean group.

Conversely, as Otto Hölder showed, every Archimedean group is isomorphic (as an ordered group) to a subgroup of the real numbers. It follows from this that every Archimedean group is necessarily an abelian group: its addition operation must be commutative.

==Examples of non-Archimedean groups==
Groups that cannot be linearly ordered, such as the finite groups, are not Archimedean. For another example, see the &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers, a system of numbers generalizing the rational numbers in a different way to the real numbers.

Non-Archimedean ordered groups also exist; the ordered group (&quot;G&quot;, +, ≤) defined as follows is not Archimedean. Let the elements of &quot;G&quot; be the points of the Euclidean plane, given by their Cartesian coordinates: pairs (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) of real numbers. Let the group addition operation be pointwise (vector) addition, and order these points in lexicographic order: if &quot;a&quot; = (&quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;) and &quot;b&quot; = (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;), then &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; = (&quot;u&quot; + &quot;x&quot;, &quot;v&quot; + &quot;y&quot;), and
&quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; exactly when either &quot;v&quot; &lt; &quot;y&quot; or &quot;v&quot; = &quot;y&quot; and &quot;u&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;. Then this gives an ordered group, but one that is not Archimedean. To see this, consider the elements (1, 0) and (0, 1), both of which are greater than the zero element of the group (the origin). For every natural number &quot;n&quot;, it follows from these definitions that &quot;n&quot; (1, 0) = (&quot;n&quot;, 0) &lt; (0, 1), so there is no &quot;n&quot; that satisfies the Archimedean property. This group can be thought of as the additive group of pairs of a real number and an infinitesimal, formula_1 where formula_2 is a unit infinitesimal: formula_3 but formula_4 for any positive real number formula_5. Non-Archimedean ordered fields can be defined similarly, and their additive groups are non-Archimedean ordered groups. These are used in non-standard analysis, and include the hyperreal numbers and surreal numbers.

While non-Archimedean ordered groups cannot be embedded in the real numbers, they can be embedded in a power of the real numbers, with lexicographic order, by the Hahn embedding theorem; the example above is the 2-dimensional case.

==Additional properties==
Every Archimedean group has the property that, for every Dedekind cut of the group, and every group element ε &gt; 0, there exists another group element &quot;x&quot; with &quot;x&quot; on the lower side of the cut and &quot;x&quot; + ε on the upper side of the cut. However, there exist non-Archimedean ordered groups with the same property. The fact that Archimedean groups are abelian can be generalized: every ordered group with this property is abelian.

==Generalisations==
Archimedean groups can be generalised to Archimedean monoids, linearly ordered monoids that obey the Archimedean property. Examples include the natural numbers, the non-negative rational numbers, and the non-negative real numbers, with the usual binary operation formula_6 and order formula_7. Through a similar proof as for Archimedean groups, Archimedean monoids can be shown to be commutative.

<doc id="264175" wikidata="Q431244" url="?curid=264175" title="Peter Hook">
<text>Peter Hook (born 13 February 1956) is an English musician. He was the bassist and co-founder of the post-punk band Joy Division and its successor New Order. He often used the bass as a lead instrument, playing melodies on the high strings with a signature heavy chorus effect.

Along with Bernard Sumner, Hook formed the band which was to become Joy Division in 1976. Following the death of lead singer Ian Curtis in 1980, the band reformed as New Order, and Hook played bass with them until 2007.

Hook has recorded one album with Revenge (&quot;One True Passion&quot;), two albums with Monaco (&quot;Music for Pleasure&quot; and &quot;Monaco&quot;) and one album with Freebass (&quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Life&quot;), serving as bassist, keyboardist and lead vocalist. He is currently the lead singer and one of the bassists for Peter Hook &amp; The Light.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Hook was born Peter Woodhead on 13 February 1956, in Broughton, Salford, Lancashire, to Irene (née Acton; 1928–2000), and John Woodhead (1926–2005). His parents divorced in 1959 when he was three years old. He and his brother Christopher were brought up by his maternal grandmother Alicia Acton (née Chapman; 1896–1968) until 1962, when his mother remarried Ernest William Hook (1914–1988). Like his bandmate Bernard Sumner, he took his stepfather&#x27;s surname, although in contrast to his friend he kept it, even creating his nickname, &quot;Hooky&quot;, from it. Because of his stepfather&#x27;s work, he spent part of his childhood in Jamaica before returning to Salford, where he attended Salford Grammar School.

=== Joy Division (1976–1980) ===
On 4 June and 20 July 1976, childhood friends Bernard Sumner and Hook attended a Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. The following day Hook borrowed £35 from his mother to buy his first bass guitar. Inspired by the performance, Sumner and Hook formed a band with their friend Terry Mason, who had also attended the shows.

Their band, originally called Warsaw, debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. The band played their first gig as Joy Division on 25 January 1978 at Pip&#x27;s Disco in Manchester.

=== New Order (1980–1993) ===
In 1980, after Joy Division, the remaining members formed New Order. The band continued until they first broke up in 1993.

In 1984, Hook recorded the single &quot;Telstar&quot; with the short-lived band Ad Infinitum. In the late 1980s, Hook also worked as a producer for bands such as Inspiral Carpets and the Stone Roses.

=== After New Order disbanding (1993–98) ===
In 1995, he toured with the Durutti Column. He has recorded one album with the band Revenge and two with Monaco (both as bassist, keyboardist and lead vocalist) with David Potts, the latter of which scored a club and alternative radio hit &quot;What Do You Want From Me?&quot; in 1997.

=== New Order reformation (1998–2007) ===

New Order reformed in 1998.

Hook contributed to Perry Farrell&#x27;s Satellite Party. His bass can be heard on &quot;Wish Upon a Dogstar&quot; and &quot;Kinky&quot;. Inspired by Clint Boon of Inspiral Carpets, he started with the &quot;Return to New York&quot; nights in London.

He contributed a distinctive bassline to Hybrid&#x27;s 2003 single &quot;True to Form&quot;, as well as another track from their &quot;Morning Sci-Fi&quot; album, &quot;Higher Than a Skyscraper&quot;, playing on stage with them on a number of dates of their ensuing tour.

Hook also co-owned the Suite Sixteen recording studio, formerly Cargo Studios, which Hook purchased with Chris Hewitt in 1984. Cargo and Suite Sixteen in Kenion Street, Rochdale were major studios in the history of punk and post-punk music. A blue plaque was unveiled on the Kenion Street music building in Rochdale that used to house the studios in September 2009 and Peter Hook played a special concert in Rochdale on that day with Section 25 donating all proceeds to the Back Door Music Project, a Rochdale youth project for people interested in music.

In the mid 2000s, Hook was regularly performing as a DJ, however he was discovered to be playing pre-mixed CDs and only miming the actions of a DJ. He admitted he was only pretending to be a DJ on his Myspace blog, but then removed it due to public backlash.

=== Post New Order (2007–2009) ===
On 4 May 2007, Hook announced on Xfm that he and New Order singer/guitarist Bernard Sumner were no longer working together, effectively spelling the end for the band; the band later denied disbanding. He then played and recorded a studio album, &quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Life&quot;, with a new band project called Freebass with bass players Mani (The Stone Roses) and Andy Rourke (ex-the Smiths).

Hook and Potts reformed Monaco on two occasions in 2007, with original drummer Paul Kehoe and Hook&#x27;s son Jack completing the line up for two gigs at Manchester&#x27;s Hard Rock Cafe in March and at the Ritz Theatre in October. He is featured on &quot;Dirty Thirty&quot; and &quot;Blunts &amp; Robots&quot;, two tracks off of the Crystal Method&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Divided by Night&quot;. Hook compiled &quot;The Hacienda Acid House Classics&quot; in 2009 following on from his original mix of &quot;The Hacienda Classics&quot; from 2006. In October 2009, Hook published his book on his time as co-owner of the Hacienda, &quot;How Not to Run a Club&quot;.

=== Peter Hook &amp; The Light (2010–present) ===

Hook then opened a new club and live venue in Manchester, FAC 251 – The Factory, in February 2010 singing lead vocals with his band, Peter Hook &amp; The Light. The club is situated in the old head offices of Factory Records in Manchester city centre. On 18 May 2010, the 30th anniversary of Ian Curtis&#x27; death, the Light performed a set of Joy Division songs including every track from &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot;. In 2010, Hook also recorded and released two EPs on American indie record label 24 Hour Service Station as Man Ray with production partner and Freebass keyboardist Phil Murphy. The first, released in April and entitled &quot;Summer &#x27;88&quot;, revisited the staple sounds of the Hacienda nightclub, with the duo using a mixture of classic Roland synths and drum machines to simulate early acid house vibes. &quot;Tokyo Joe&quot; followed in December, blending Hook&#x27;s trademark high range bass sound and old school punk inflected vocal chant with Murphy&#x27;s classic synths, guitars and drum machines to produce an indie dance track reminiscent of classic New Order. The song was also used as the theme to FAC 251 – The Factory.

In 2010, six &#x27;Peter Hook Hacienda Bass&#x27; guitars were to be built using the maple dancefloor sections from the Hacienda as the fretboard on the neck of the guitar. In 2011, Peter Hook &amp; The Light released &quot;1102 2011 EP&quot; which includes four versions of Joy Division songs, including the previously unrecorded &quot;Pictures in My Mind&quot;. The EP took its name from the palindromic recording date of 11 February 2011 at Blueprint Studio, Salford. It featured Happy Mondays vocalist Rowetta who sings versions of &quot;Atmosphere&quot;, &quot;New Dawn Fades&quot; and &quot;Insight&quot;. Hook sings &quot;Pictures in My Mind&quot;, an unfinished Joy Division track discovered on a demo recording unearthed by the band&#x27;s &quot;bootleg society&quot; from a rehearsal tape stolen in 1977, setting it between Warsaw and &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot;. The effervescent and punk-tinged tune was completed for this release, and was declared &quot;a worthy addition to the Joy Division canon&quot; by BBC 6Music DJ Mark Radcliffe.

In 2012, Hook launched a brand new master&#x27;s degree programme in Music Industry Management and Promotion at the University of Central Lancashire. It provides an opportunity to study the music business at postgraduate level and to get hands-on experience of working within the industry. Students will combine their academic studies with a placement in a commercial music industry institution working on real world projects. The course offers industrial experience which will involve working in the Factory 251 venue in Manchester, providing contact with significant industry figures connected with this culturally important company. Hook was awarded an honorary fellowship from the same institution on 11 July 2012.
On 29 January 2013, Hook published &quot;Unknown Pleasures: Inside Joy Division&quot;; an autobiographical account of his time in the band. In November 2015, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Hook was suing his former bandmates for continuing to use the name New Order. The parties settled out of court.

On 6 October 2016, he released the book &quot;Substance: Inside New Order&quot;. On 9 April 2020, he collaborated with the virtual band Gorillaz&#x27;s musical project &quot;Song Machine&quot;, featuring on the song &quot;Aries&quot; alongside English musician Georgia.

== Personal life ==
Hook has two children from his first marriage with Iris Bates, son Jack and daughter Heather. Jack has been the touring bassist for The Smashing Pumpkins since 2015.

In 1994, he married comedian Caroline Aherne but the marriage ended in 1997. He later said, after Aherne&#x27;s death, that it had been a turbulent, violent and abusive marriage. He subsequently married Rebecca Jones and has a daughter with her.

In July 2012, Hook was awarded an Honorary Fellowship, from the University of Central Lancashire, during the graduation of the university&#x27;s creative arts students.

== Playing style ==
Hook has said that he developed his high bass lines when he started playing with Joy Division because the speaker that he used initially (bought from his former art teacher for £10) was so poor he had to play that high to be able to hear what he was doing, as Bernard Sumner&#x27;s guitar was so loud. With New Order&#x27;s ever increasing use of sequenced synthesised bass, especially throughout most of 1989&#x27;s &quot;Technique&quot; and 1993&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;, Hook&#x27;s bass playing became ever more melodic and rhythmic, often exploiting the higher notes on his bass guitars. Hook contributed backing vocals on numerous Joy Division songs in concert and sang co-lead with Ian Curtis on Joy Division&#x27;s &quot;Interzone&quot;. He sings lead on two New Order songs (&quot;Dreams Never End&quot; and &quot;Doubts Even Here&quot; from the 1981 debut album &quot;Movement&quot;).

== Equipment ==

=== Bass guitars ===
* Gibson EB-0 copy – Hook&#x27;s first bass guitar, bought at Mazel&#x27;s Music Shop in Manchester in 1976 and used live with Warsaw 1977 (there are photos of him playing it at a 1977 gig at Rafters, Manchester) and on 18 July 1977 Warsaw demos. He still owns it.
* Gibson EB-1 – He used it after retiring the EB-0 copy, but sold it years later because he had no money after building a custom bass guitar.
* Hondo Rickenbacker 4001 bass copy – Used on Joy Division&#x27;s 1978–1980 recordings and used live with Joy Division 1978–1980.
* Shergold Marathon six string bass – Used with later Joy Division and New Order
* Eccleshall 335 Style Hollowbody 4 string bass – Used with New Order since early 1980s. This twin pickup 34&quot; Scale Length bass guitar has a hollow body similar to the Gibson EB-2. The neck is glued to the body like a Gibson and built with maple tops and an ebony fret board. The electronics are identical to his Yamaha BB1200S with active and passive pickups. His Eccleshall has standard twin tone and volume knobs each controlling the neck or bridge pickup, in addition with treble, mid and bass controls. Switches to start the active pickups are located between the tone and volume knobs. A 9 volt battery powers the active circuits. The headstock is labelled &quot;HOT 1&quot; or &quot;Hot 2&quot; depending on which model he uses. The name &quot;Eccleshall&quot; has been labeled behind the headstock.
*Yamaha bass guitars BB1200S and BB734. He currently tours with the newer BB734 model. In 2020, Yamaha released the Peter Hook Signature Bass which features details from his BB1200S and BB734.

=== Amplification and effects ===
The main equipment Hook used during the early days of New Order was an Alembic F-2B preamp/Roland rack unit/Amcron DC-300A power amp fed through two large custom built 2 × 15 Gauss loaded flightcase cabinets designed and built by Chris Hewitt of Tractor Music. These can be seen in the &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot; music video, as can Hook&#x27;s Yamaha BB1200. The Alembic–Amcron–Gauss system was designed by Hook, Chris Hewitt and Martin Hannett. In the earlier days of Joy Division, Hook used a Sound City L120 head and then a Hiwatt Custom 100 Watt head. The Sound City and Hiwatt heads were both used with a Vox Foundation 1 × 18 cabinet bought from Hook&#x27;s former art teacher. The Hiwatt was then used on top of a 4 × 15 Gauss loaded Marshall cabinet put together by Tractor. The Marshall 4 × 15 Gauss cabinet was stolen during New Order&#x27;s first visit to America. He has also used an Ampeg SVT rig, and has expressed interest in Ashdown amplification.

For the most part, his distinctive tone comes from the use of a chorus pedal, an Electro-Harmonix Clone Theory. In New Order from 1990 onwards Hook used Hiwatt 200 watt heads mounted on Hiwatt 1 × 15 and 4 × 10 combined speaker cabinets with Fane speakers. With Revenge and Monaco, he updated an Ampeg SVT, which is used at maximum volume when playing live. He is currently using an Ampeg SVT-CL with an Ampeg cabinet.

== Film portrayals ==
In Michael Winterbottom&#x27;s 2002 film &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot;, which focused on Factory Records, Hook was played by Ralf Little. In Anton Corbijn&#x27;s 2007 film &quot;Control&quot;, which focused on the life of Ian Curtis, he was played by Joe Anderson.
