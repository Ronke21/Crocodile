<text>A ventilator is a type of breathing apparatus, a class of medical technology that provides mechanical ventilation by moving breathable air into and out of the lungs, to deliver breaths to a patient who is physically unable to breathe, or breathing insufficiently. Ventilators may be computerized microprocessor-controlled machines, but patients can also be ventilated with a simple, hand-operated bag valve mask. Ventilators are chiefly used in intensive-care medicine, home care, and emergency medicine (as standalone units) and in anesthesiology (as a component of an anesthesia machine).

Ventilators are sometimes called &quot;respirators&quot;, a term commonly used for them in the 1950s (particularly the &quot;Bird respirator&quot;). However, contemporary medical terminology uses the word &quot;respirator&quot; to refer to a face-mask that protects wearers against hazardous airborne substances.

==Function==

In its simplest form, a modern positive pressure ventilator, consists of a compressible air reservoir or turbine, air and oxygen supplies, a set of valves and tubes, and a disposable or reusable &quot;patient circuit&quot;. The air reservoir is pneumatically compressed several times a minute to deliver room-air, or in most cases, an air/oxygen mixture to the patient. If a turbine is used, the turbine pushes air through the ventilator, with a flow valve adjusting pressure to meet patient-specific parameters. When over pressure is released, the patient will exhale passively due to the lungs&#x27; elasticity, the exhaled air being released usually through a one-way valve within the patient circuit called the patient manifold.

Ventilators may also be equipped with monitoring and alarm systems for patient-related parameters (e.g., pressure, volume, and flow) and ventilator function (e.g., air leakage, power failure, mechanical failure), backup batteries, oxygen tanks, and remote control. The pneumatic system is nowadays often replaced by a computer-controlled turbopump.

=== Ventilator pressures labeled ===

Modern ventilators are electronically controlled by a small embedded system to allow exact adaptation of pressure and flow characteristics to an individual patient&#x27;s needs. Fine-tuned ventilator settings also serve to make ventilation more tolerable and comfortable for the patient. In Canada and the United States, respiratory therapists are responsible for tuning these settings, while biomedical technologists are responsible for the maintenance. In the United Kingdom and Europe the management of the patient&#x27;s interaction with the ventilator is done by critical care nurses.

The patient circuit usually consists of a set of three durable, yet lightweight plastic tubes, separated by function (e.g. inhaled air, patient pressure, exhaled air). Determined by the type of ventilation needed, the patient-end of the circuit may be either noninvasive or invasive.

Noninvasive methods, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and non-invasive ventilation, which are adequate for patients who require a ventilator only while sleeping and resting, mainly employ a nasal mask. Invasive methods require intubation, which for long-term ventilator dependence will normally be a tracheotomy cannula, as this is much more comfortable and practical for long-term care than is larynx or nasal intubation.

=== Safety-critical system ===
As failure may result in death, mechanical ventilation systems are classified as safety-critical systems, and precautions must be taken to ensure that they are highly reliable, including their power supply. Ventilatory failure is the inability to sustain a sufficient rate of CO2 elimination to maintain a stable pH without mechanical assistance, muscle fatigue, or intolerable dyspnea. Mechanical ventilators are therefore carefully designed so that no single point of failure can endanger the patient. They may have manual backup mechanisms to enable hand-driven respiration in the absence of power (such as the mechanical ventilator integrated into an anaesthetic machine). They may also have safety valves, which open to atmosphere in the absence of power to act as an anti-suffocation valve for spontaneous breathing of the patient. Some systems are also equipped with compressed-gas tanks, air compressors or backup batteries to provide ventilation in case of power failure or defective gas supplies, and methods to operate or call for help if their mechanisms or software fail. Power failures, such as during a natural disaster, can create a life-threatening emergency for people using ventilators in a home care setting. Battery power may be sufficient for a brief loss of electricity, but longer power outages may require going to a hospital.

== History ==

The history of mechanical ventilation begins with various versions of what was eventually called the iron lung, a form of noninvasive negative-pressure ventilator widely used during the polio epidemics of the twentieth century after the introduction of the &quot;Drinker respirator&quot; in 1928, improvements introduced by John Haven Emerson in 1931, and the Both respirator in 1937. Other forms of noninvasive ventilators, also used widely for polio patients, include Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation, the rocking bed, and rather primitive positive pressure machines.

In 1949, John Haven Emerson developed a mechanical assister for anaesthesia with the cooperation of the anaesthesia department at Harvard University. Mechanical ventilators began to be used increasingly in anaesthesia and intensive care during the 1950s. Their development was stimulated both by the need to treat polio patients and the increasing use of muscle relaxants during anaesthesia. Relaxant drugs paralyse the patient and improve operating conditions for the surgeon but also paralyse the respiratory muscles. In 1953 Bjørn Aage Ibsen set up what became the world&#x27;s first Medical/Surgical ICU utilizing muscle relaxants and controlled ventilation.
In the United Kingdom, the East Radcliffe and Beaver models were early examples. The former used a Sturmey-Archer bicycle hub gear to provide a range of speeds, and the latter an automotive windscreen wiper motor to drive the bellows used to inflate the lungs. Electric motors were, however, a problem in the operating theatres of that time, as their use caused an explosion hazard in the presence of flammable anaesthetics such as ether and cyclopropane. In 1952, Roger Manley of the Westminster Hospital, London, developed a ventilator which was entirely gas-driven and became the most popular model used in Europe. It was an elegant design, and became a great favourite with European anaesthetists for four decades, prior to the introduction of models controlled by electronics. It was independent of electrical power and caused no explosion hazard. The original Mark I unit was developed to become the Manley Mark II in collaboration with the Blease company, which manufactured many thousands of these units. Its principle of operation was very simple, an incoming gas flow was used to lift a weighted bellows unit, which fell intermittently under gravity, forcing breathing gases into the patient&#x27;s lungs. The inflation pressure could be varied by sliding the movable weight on top of the bellows. The volume of gas delivered was adjustable using a curved slider, which restricted bellows excursion. Residual pressure after the completion of expiration was also configurable, using a small weighted arm visible to the lower right of the front panel. This was a robust unit and its availability encouraged the introduction of positive pressure ventilation techniques into mainstream European anesthetic practice.

The 1955 release of Forrest Bird&#x27;s &quot;Bird Universal Medical Respirator&quot; in the United States changed the way mechanical ventilation was performed, with the small green box becoming a familiar piece of medical equipment. The unit was sold as the Bird Mark 7 Respirator and informally called the &quot;Bird&quot;. It was a pneumatic device and therefore required no electrical power source to operate.

In 1965, the Army Emergency Respirator was developed in collaboration with the Harry Diamond Laboratories (now part of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory) and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. Its design incorporated the principle of fluid amplification in order to govern pneumatic functions. Fluid amplification allowed the respirator to be manufactured entirely without moving parts, yet capable of complex resuscitative functions. Elimination of moving parts increased performance reliability and minimized maintenance. The mask is composed of a poly(methyl methacrylate) (commercially known as Lucite) block, about the size of a pack of cards, with machined channels and a cemented or screwed-in cover plate. The reduction of moving parts cut manufacturing costs and increased durability.

The bistable fluid amplifier design allowed the respirator to function as both a respiratory assistor and controller. It could functionally transition between assistor and controller automatically, based on the patient&#x27;s needs. The dynamic pressure and turbulent jet flow of gas from inhalation to exhalation allowed the respirator to synchronize with the breathing of the patient.

Intensive care environments around the world revolutionized in 1971 by the introduction of the first SERVO 900 ventilator (Elema-Schönander), constructed by Björn Jonson. It was a small, silent and effective electronic ventilator, with the famous SERVO feedback system controlling what had been set and regulating delivery. For the first time, the machine could deliver the set volume in volume control ventilation.

===Microprocessor ventilators===
Microprocessor control led to the third generation of intensive care unit (ICU) ventilators, starting with the Dräger EV-A in 1982 in Germany which allowed monitoring the patient&#x27;s breathing curve on an LCD monitor. One year later followed Puritan Bennett 7200 and Bear 1000, SERVO 300 and Hamilton Veolar over the next decade. Microprocessors enable customized gas delivery and monitoring, and mechanisms for gas delivery that are much more responsive to patient needs than previous generations of mechanical ventilators.
== Open-source ventilators ==

An open-source ventilator is a disaster-situation ventilator made using a freely-licensed design, and ideally, freely-available components and parts. Designs, components, and parts may be anywhere from completely reverse-engineered to completely new creations, components may be adaptations of various inexpensive existing products, and special hard-to-find and/or expensive parts may be 3D printed instead of sourced.

During the 2019–2020 COVID-19 pandemic, various kinds of ventilators have been considered. Deaths caused by COVID-19 have occurred when the most severely infected experience acute respiratory distress syndrome, a widespread inflammation in the lungs that impairs the lungs&#x27; ability to absorb oxygen and expel carbon dioxide. These patients require a capable ventilator to continue breathing.

Among ventilators that might be brought into use for treating people with COVID-19, there have been many concerns. These include current availability, the challenge of making more and lower cost ventilators, effectiveness, functional design, safety, portability, suitability for infants, assignment to treat other illnesses, and operator training. Deploying the best possible mix of ventilators can save the most lives.

Although not formally open-sourced, the Ventec V+ Pro ventilator was developed in April 2020 as a shared effort between Ventec Life Systems and General Motors, to provide a rapid supply of 30,000 ventilators capable of treating COVID-19 patients.

A major worldwide design effort began during the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic after a Hackaday project was started, in order to respond to expected ventilator shortages causing higher mortality rate among severe patients.

On March 20, 2020, the Irish Health Service began reviewing designs. A prototype is being designed and tested in Colombia.

The Polish company Urbicum reports successful testing of a 3D-printed open-source prototype device called VentilAid. The makers describe it as a last resort device when professional equipment is missing. The design is publicly available. The first Ventilaid prototype requires compressed air to run.

On March 21, 2020, the New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI) began maintaining a strategic list of open source designs being worked on. The NECSI project considers manufacturing capability, medical safety and need for treating patients in various conditions, speed dealing with legal and political issues, logistics and supply. NECSI is staffed with scientists from Harvard and MIT and others who have an understanding of pandemics, medicine, systems, risk, and data collection.

The University of Minnesota Bakken Medical Device Center initiated a collaboration with various companies to bring a ventilator alternative to the market that works as a one-armed robot and replaces the need for manual ventilation in emergency situations. The &quot;Coventor&quot; device was developed in a very short time and approved on April 15, 2020, by the FDA, only 30 days after conception. The mechanical ventilator is designed for use by trained medical professionals in intensive care units and easy to operate. It has a compact design and is relatively inexpensive to manufacture and distribute. The cost is only about 4% of a normal ventilator. In addition, this device does not require pressurized oxygen or air supply, as is normally the case. A first series is manufactured by Boston Scientific. The plans are to be freely available online to the general public without royalties.

==COVID-19 pandemic==
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to shortages of essential goods and services - from hand sanitizers to masks to beds to ventilators. Countries around the world have experienced shortages of ventilators. Furthermore, fifty-four governments, including many in Europe and Asia, imposed restrictions on medical supply exports in response to the coronavirus pandemic. 

The capacities to produce and distribute invasive and non-invasive ventilators vary by country. In the initial phase of the pandemic, China ramped up its production of ventilators, secured large amounts of donations from private firms, and dramatically increased imports of medical devices worldwide. As a result, the country accumulated a reservoir of ventilators throughout the pandemic in Wuhan. Western Europe and the United States, which outrank China in their production capacities, suffered a shortage of supplies due to the sudden and scattered outbreaks throughout the North American and European continents. Finally, Central Asia, Africa, and Latin America, which depend almost entirely on importing ventilators, suffered severe shortages of supplies.

Healthcare policy-makers have met serious challenges to estimate the number of ventilators needed and used during the pandemic. When data is often not available for ventilators specifically, estimates are sometimes made based on the number of intensive care unit beds available, which often contain ventilators.

===United States===
In 2006, president George W. Bush signed the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, which created the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) within the United States Department of Health and Human Services. In preparation for a possible epidemic of respiratory disease, the newly created office awarded a $6 million contract to Newport Medical Instruments, a small company in California, to make 40,000 ventilators for under $3,000 apiece. In 2011, Newport sent three prototypes to the Centers for Disease Control. In 2012, Covidien, a $12 billion/year medical device manufacturer, which manufactured more expensive competing ventilators, bought Newport for $100 million. Covidien delayed and in 2014 cancelled the contract.

BARDA started over again with a new company, Philips, and in July 2019, the FDA approved the Philips ventilator, and the government ordered 10,000 ventilators for delivery in mid-2020.

On April 23, 2020, NASA reported building, in 37 days, a successful COVID-19 ventilator, named VITAL (&quot;Ventilator Intervention Technology Accessible Locally&quot;). On April 30, NASA reported receiving fast-track approval for emergency use by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the new ventilator. On May 29, NASA reported that eight manufacturers were selected to manufacture the new ventilator.

===Canada===

On April 7, 2020, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that the Canadian Federal Government would be sourcing thousands of &#x27;Made in Canada&#x27; ventilators. A number of organisations responded from across the country. They delivered a large quantity of ventilators to the National Emergency Strategic Stockpile. From west to east, the companies include Canadian Emergency Ventilators Inc, Bayliss Medical Inc, Thornhill Medical, Vexos Inc, and CAE Inc.

<text>In programming language theory and type theory, polymorphism is the use of one symbol to represent multiple different types.

In object-oriented programming, polymorphism is the provision of one interface to entities of different data types. The concept is borrowed from a principle in biology where an organism or species can have many different forms or stages.

The most commonly recognized major forms of polymorphism are:
* &quot;Ad hoc polymorphism&quot;: defines a common interface for an arbitrary set of individually specified types.
* &quot;Parametric polymorphism&quot;: not specifying concrete types and instead use abstract symbols that can substitute for any type.
* &quot;Subtyping&quot; (also called &quot;subtype polymorphism&quot; or &quot;inclusion polymorphism&quot;): when a name denotes instances of many different classes related by some common superclass.

==History==
Interest in polymorphic type systems developed significantly in the 1990s, with practical implementations beginning to appear by the end of the decade. &quot;Ad hoc polymorphism&quot; and &quot;parametric polymorphism&quot; were originally described in Christopher Strachey&#x27;s &quot;Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages&quot;, where they are listed as &quot;the two main classes&quot; of polymorphism. Ad hoc polymorphism was a feature of ALGOL 68, while parametric polymorphism was the core feature of ML&#x27;s type system.

In a 1985 paper, Peter Wegner and Luca Cardelli introduced the term &quot;inclusion polymorphism&quot; to model subtypes and inheritance, citing Simula as the first programming language to implement it.

==Forms==
===Ad hoc polymorphism===

Christopher Strachey chose the term &quot;ad hoc polymorphism&quot; to refer to polymorphic functions that can be applied to arguments of different types, but that behave differently depending on the type of the argument to which they are applied (also known as function overloading or operator overloading). The term &quot;ad hoc&quot; in this context is not pejorative: instead, it means that this form of polymorphism is not a fundamental feature of the type system. In the Java example below, the codice_1 functions seem to work generically over two types (integer and string) when looking at the invocations, but are considered to be two entirely distinct functions by the compiler for all intents and purposes:
class AdHocPolymorphic {
 public String add(int x, int y) {
 return &quot;Sum: &quot; + (x + y);

 public String add(String name) {
 return &quot;Added &quot; + name;
}

public class Adhoc {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 AdHocPolymorphic poly = new AdHocPolymorphic();

 System.out.println(poly.add(1,2)); // prints &quot;Sum: 3&quot;
 System.out.println(poly.add(&quot;Jay&quot;)); // prints &quot;Added Jay&quot;
}
In dynamically typed languages the situation can be more complex as the correct function that needs to be invoked might only be determinable at run time.

Implicit type conversion has also been defined as a form of polymorphism, referred to as &quot;coercion polymorphism&quot;.

===Parametric polymorphism===

&quot;Parametric polymorphism&quot; allows a function or a data type to be written generically, so that it can handle values &quot;uniformly&quot; without depending on their type. Parametric polymorphism is a way to make a language more expressive while still maintaining full static type safety.

The concept of parametric polymorphism applies to both data types and functions. A function that can evaluate to or be applied to values of different types is known as a &quot;polymorphic function.&quot; A data type that can appear to be of a generalized type (e.g., a list with elements of arbitrary type) is designated &quot;polymorphic data type&quot; like the generalized type from which such specializations are made.

Parametric polymorphism is ubiquitous in functional programming, where it is often simply referred to as &quot;polymorphism&quot;. The next example in Haskell shows a parameterized list data type and two parametrically polymorphic functions on them:
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)

length :: List a -&gt; Integer
length Nil = 0
length (Cons x xs) = 1 + length xs

map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; List a -&gt; List b
map f Nil = Nil
map f (Cons x xs) = Cons (f x) (map f xs)
Parametric polymorphism is also available in several object-oriented languages. For instance, templates in C++ and D, or under the name generics in C#, Delphi, Java, and Go:
class List&lt;T&gt; {
 class Node&lt;T&gt; {
 T elem;
 Node&lt;T&gt; next;
 Node&lt;T&gt; head;
 int length() { ... }

List&lt;B&gt; map(Func&lt;A, B&gt; f, List&lt;A&gt; xs) {
}
John C. Reynolds (and later Jean-Yves Girard) formally developed this notion of polymorphism as an extension to lambda calculus (called the polymorphic lambda calculus or System F). Any parametrically polymorphic function is necessarily restricted in what it can do, working on the shape of the data instead of its value, leading to the concept of parametricity.

===Subtyping===

Some languages employ the idea of &quot;subtyping&quot; (also called &quot;subtype polymorphism&quot; or &quot;inclusion polymorphism&quot;) to restrict the range of types that can be used in a particular case of polymorphism. In these languages, subtyping allows a function to be written to take an object of a certain type &quot;T&quot;, but also work correctly, if passed an object that belongs to a type &quot;S&quot; that is a subtype of &quot;T&quot; (according to the Liskov substitution principle). This type relation is sometimes written . Conversely, &quot;T&quot; is said to be a &quot;supertype&quot; of &quot;S&quot;, written . Subtype polymorphism is usually resolved dynamically (see below).

In the following Java example cats and dogs are made subtypes of pets. The procedure codice_2 accepts a pet, but will also work correctly if a subtype is passed to it:
abstract class Pet {
 abstract String speak();

class Cat extends Pet {
 String speak() {
 return &quot;Meow!&quot;;
}

class Dog extends Pet {
 String speak() {
 return &quot;Woof!&quot;;
}

static void letsHear(final Pet pet) {
 println(pet.speak());

static void main(String[] args) {
 letsHear(new Cat());
 letsHear(new Dog());


In another example, if &quot;Number&quot;, &quot;Rational&quot;, and &quot;Integer&quot; are types such that and (&quot;Rational&quot; and &quot;Integer&quot; as subtypes of a type &quot;Number&quot; that is a supertype of them), a function written to take a &quot;Number&quot; will work equally well when passed an &quot;Integer&quot; or &quot;Rational&quot; as when passed a &quot;Number&quot;. The actual type of the object can be hidden from clients into a black box, and accessed via object identity. If the &quot;Number&quot; type is &quot;abstract&quot;, it may not even be possible to get your hands on an object whose &quot;most-derived&quot; type is &quot;Number&quot; (see abstract data type, abstract class). This particular kind of type hierarchy is known, especially in the context of the Scheme language, as a &quot;numerical tower&quot;, and usually contains many more types.

Object-oriented programming languages offer subtype polymorphism using &quot;subclassing&quot; (also known as &quot;inheritance&quot;). In typical implementations, each class contains what is called a &quot;virtual table&quot; (shortly called &quot;vtable&quot;) — a table of functions that implement the polymorphic part of the class interface—and each object contains a pointer to the vtable of its class, which is then consulted whenever a polymorphic method is called. This mechanism is an example of:
* &quot;late binding&quot;, because virtual function calls are not bound until the time of invocation;
* &quot;single dispatch&quot; (i.e., single-argument polymorphism), because virtual function calls are bound simply by looking through the vtable provided by the first argument (the codice_3 object), so the runtime types of the other arguments are completely irrelevant.
The same goes for most other popular object systems. Some, however, such as Common Lisp Object System, provide &quot;multiple dispatch&quot;, under which method calls are polymorphic in &quot;all&quot; arguments.

The interaction between parametric polymorphism and subtyping leads to the concepts of variance and bounded quantification.

===Row polymorphism===

Row polymorphism is a similar, but distinct concept from subtyping. It deals with structural types. It allows the usage of all values whose types have certain properties, without losing the remaining type information.

===Polytypism===

A related concept is &quot;polytypism&quot; (or &quot;data type genericity&quot;). A polytypic function is more general than polymorphic, and in such a function, &quot;though one can provide fixed ad hoc cases for specific data types, an ad hoc combinator is absent&quot;.

===Rank polymorphism===
Rank polymorphism is one of the defining features of the array programming languages, like APL. The essence of the rank-polymorphic programming model is implicitly treating all operations as aggregate operations, usable on arrays with arbitrarily many dimensions, which is to say that rank polymorphism allows functions to be defined to operate on arrays of any shape and size.

==Implementation aspects==
===Static and dynamic polymorphism===
Polymorphism can be distinguished by when the implementation is selected: statically (at compile time) or dynamically (at run time, typically via a virtual function). This is known respectively as &quot;static dispatch&quot; and &quot;dynamic dispatch,&quot; and the corresponding forms of polymorphism are accordingly called &quot;static polymorphism&quot; and &quot;dynamic polymorphism&quot;.

Static polymorphism executes faster, because there is no dynamic dispatch overhead, but requires additional compiler support. Further, static polymorphism allows greater static analysis by compilers (notably for optimization), source code analysis tools, and human readers (programmers). Dynamic polymorphism is more flexible but slower—for example, dynamic polymorphism allows duck typing, and a dynamically linked library may operate on objects without knowing their full type.

Static polymorphism typically occurs in ad hoc polymorphism and parametric polymorphism, whereas dynamic polymorphism is usual for subtype polymorphism. However, it is possible to achieve static polymorphism with subtyping through more sophisticated use of template metaprogramming, namely the curiously recurring template pattern.

When polymorphism is exposed via a library, static polymorphism becomes impossible for dynamic libraries as there is no way of knowing what types the parameters are when the shared object is built. While languages like C++ and Rust use monomorphized templates, the Swift programming language makes extensive use of dynamic dispatch to build the application binary interface for these libraries by default. As a result, more code can be shared for a reduced system size at the cost of runtime overhead.

<doc id="261815" wikidata="Q723821" url="?curid=261815" title="Lou Donaldson">
<text>Louis Andrew Donaldson Jr. (November 1, 1926 – November 9, 2024) was an American jazz alto saxophonist. He was best known for his soulful, bluesy approach to playing the alto saxophone, although in his formative years he was heavily influenced by Charlie Parker, as were many during the bebop era.

==Early life==
Donaldson was born in Badin, North Carolina, on November 1, 1926. He attended North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro in the early 1940s. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy during World War II and was trained at the Great Lakes bases in Chicago where he was introduced to bop music in the lively club scene.

==Career==
At the war&#x27;s conclusion, Donaldson returned to Greensboro, where he worked club dates with the Rhythm Vets, a combo composed of A and T students who had served in the U.S. Navy. The band recorded the soundtrack to a musical comedy featurette, &quot;Pitch a Boogie Woogie&quot;, in Greenville, North Carolina, in the summer of 1947. The movie had a limited run at black audience theatres in 1948 but its production company, Lord-Warner Pictures, folded and never made another film. &quot;Pitch a Boogie Woogie&quot; was restored by the American Film Institute in 1985 and re-premiered on the campus of East Carolina University in Greenville the following year. Donaldson and the surviving members of the Vets performed a reunion concert after the film&#x27;s showing. In the documentary made on &quot;Pitch&quot; by UNC-TV, &quot;Boogie in Black and White&quot;, Donaldson and his musical cohorts recall the film&#x27;s making—he originally believed that he had played clarinet on the soundtrack. A short piece of concert footage from a gig in Fayetteville, North Carolina, is included in the documentary.

Donaldson&#x27;s first jazz recordings were with bop musicians Milt Jackson and Thelonious Monk in 1952, and he participated in several small groups with other prominent jazz musicians such as trumpeter Blue Mitchell, pianist Horace Silver, and drummer Art Blakey. In 1953, he also recorded sessions with the trumpeter Clifford Brown, and with Philly Joe Jones. He was a member of Art Blakey&#x27;s Quintet for the hard bop recording sessions at Birdland on February 21, 1954, which would yield the &quot;A Night at Birdland&quot; albums for Blue Note Records.

He was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame on October 11, 2012. Also in 2012, he was named a NEA Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts.

==Retirement and death==
In 2018, Donaldson declared himself retired, having performed his final shows in 2017. On November 2, 2021, he made a public appearance at a 95th birthday tribute show at Dizzy&#x27;s Club in Manhattan, New York City. He appeared at his 96th and 97th birthday tribute shows in 2022 and 2023, but opted not to travel to New York City for his 98th birthday celebration, due to a bout of pneumonia. Shortly afterward, he died from pneumonia at a hospital in Daytona Beach, Florida, on November 9, 2024.

<text>In urinary catheterization, a latex, polyurethane, or silicone tube known as a urinary catheter is inserted into the bladder through the urethra to allow urine to drain from the bladder for collection. It may also be used to inject liquids used for treatment or diagnosis of bladder conditions. A clinician, often a nurse, usually performs the procedure, but self-catheterization is also possible. A catheter may be in place for long periods of time (indwelling catheter) or removed after each use (intermittent catheterization).

==Catheter types==
Catheters come in several basic designs:
*A Foley catheter (indwelling urinary catheter) is retained by means of a balloon at the tip that is inflated with sterile water. The balloons typically come in two different sizes: 5 cm3 and 30 cm3. They are commonly made in silicone rubber or natural rubber.
*An intermittent catheter/Robinson catheter is a flexible catheter that is removed after each use. Unlike the Foley catheter, it has no balloon on its tip and therefore cannot stay in place unaided. These can be non-coated or coated (e.g., hydrophilic coated and ready to use).
*A coudé catheter, including Tiemann&#x27;s catheter, is designed with a curved tip that makes it easier to pass through the curvature of the prostatic urethra.
*A hematuria catheter is a type of Foley catheter used for Post-TURP hemostasis. This is useful following endoscopic surgical procedures, or in the case of gross hematuria. There are both two-way and three-way hematuria catheters (double and triple lumen).
*A condom catheter can only be used by a person with a penis but carries a lower risk of infection than an indwelling catheter.

Catheter diameters are sized by the French catheter scale (F). The most common sizes are 10 F (3.3mm) to 28 F (9.3mm). The clinician selects a size large enough to allow free flow of urine, and large enough to control leakage of urine around the catheter. A larger size is necessary when the urine is thick, bloody, or contains large amounts of sediment. Larger catheters, however, are more likely to damage the urethra. Some people develop allergies or sensitivities to latex after long-term latex catheter use making it necessary to use silicone or Teflon types.

Evidence does not support an important decrease in the risk of urinary tract infections when silver-alloy catheters are used.

== Indications ==
Common indications for urinary catheterization include acute or chronic urinary retention (which can damage the kidneys) from conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, orthopedic procedures that may limit a patient&#x27;s movement, the need for accurate monitoring of input and output (such as in an ICU), urinary incontinence that may compromise the ability to heal wounds, and the effects of various surgical interventions involving the bladder, prostate, or bowel.

Intermittent self-catheterization may be indicated in cases of neurogenic bladder due to damage to the spinal cord or brain. This can be performed by the patient four to six times a day, using a clean technique. Nurses use a sterile technique to perform intermittent catheterization in hospital settings. For patients with neurogenic bladder due to spinal cord injury, intermittent catheterization (IC) is a standard method for bladder emptying. The technique is safe and effective and results in improved kidney and upper urinary tract status, lessening of vesicoureteral reflux and amelioration of continence. In addition to the clinical benefits, patient quality of life is enhanced by the increased independence and security offered by self-catheterization.

==Catheter maintenance==
A catheter that is left in place for more than a short period of time is generally attached to a drainage bag to collect the urine. This also allows for measurement of urine volume. There are three types of drainage bags: The first is a leg bag, a smaller drainage device that attaches by elastic bands to the leg. A leg bag is usually worn during the day, as it fits discreetly under pants or skirts, and is easily emptied into a toilet. The second type of drainage bag is a larger device called a down drain that may be used overnight. This device is hung on a hook under the patient&#x27;s bed—never placed on the floor, due to the risk of bacterial infection. The third is called a belly bag and is secured around the waist. This bag can be worn at all times. It can be worn under the patient&#x27;s underwear to provide a totally undetectable look.

During long-term use, the catheter may be left in place all the time, or a patient may be instructed on a procedure for placing a catheter just long enough to empty the bladder and then removing it (known as &quot;intermittent self-catheterization&quot;). Patients undergoing major surgery are often catheterized and may remain so for some time. The patient may require irrigation of the bladder with sterile saline injected through the catheter to flush out clots or other matter that does not drain.

==Complications==

Catheterization can have short and long term complications. Generally long-term catheterization carries higher risk of complications. Long-term catheterization carries a significant risk of urinary tract infection. Because of this risk catheterization is a last resort for the management of incontinence where other measures have proved unsuccessful. Other long term complications may include blood infections (sepsis), urethral injury, skin breakdown, bladder stones, and blood in the urine (hematuria). After many years of catheter use, bladder cancer may also develop. 

Some people experience bladder spasms with catheterization, which may be more common in males. If bladder spasms occur, or there is no urine in the drainage bag, the catheter may be blocked by blood, thick sediment, or a kink in the catheter or drainage tubing. Sometimes spasms are caused by the catheter irritating the bladder, prostate/Skene&#x27;s glands, or penis/vulva. Such spasms can be controlled with medication such as butylscopolamine, although most patients eventually adjust to the irritation and the spasms go away.

==Preventing infection==
Everyday care of the catheter and drainage bag is important to reduce the risk of infection. Such precautions include:
* Urinary catheterization should be done in a sterile aseptic manner. 
* Cleansing the urethral area (the area where the catheter exits body) and the catheter itself.
* Disconnecting the drainage bag from catheter only with clean hands
* Disconnecting the drainage bag as seldom as possible.
* Keeping the drainage bag connector as clean as possible and cleaning the drainage bag periodically.
* Use of a thin catheter where possible to reduce the risk of harming the urethra during insertion.
* Drinking sufficient liquid to produce at least two litres of urine daily
* Sexual activity is very high risk for urinary infections, especially for catheterized patients with vulvas.

There is no clear evidence that any one catheter type or insertion technique is superior compared to another in preventing infections or complications. In the UK it is generally accepted that cleaning the area surrounding the urethral meatus with 0.9% sodium chloride solution is sufficient for catheterized patients regardless of their genitalia, as there is no reliable evidence to suggest that the use of antiseptic agents reduces the risk of urinary tract infection.

Recent developments in the field of the temporary prostatic stent have been viewed as a possible alternative to indwelling catheterization and the infections associated with their use.

==History==
Ancient Egyptian and Roman physicians have been described using reeds as urinary catheters to overcome blockages, and catheterization to relieve urinary retention has also been described in ancient Indian and Chinese texts.

<text>Lewis Cass (October 9, 1782June 17, 1866) was a United States Army officer and politician. He represented Michigan in the United States Senate and served in the Cabinets of two U.S. Presidents, Andrew Jackson and James Buchanan. He was also the 1848 Democratic presidential nominee. A slave owner himself, he was a leading spokesman for the doctrine of popular sovereignty, which at the time held the idea that people in each U.S state should have the right to decide on whether to permit or prohibit slavery, believing in the idea of states&#x27; rights.

Born in Exeter, New Hampshire, he attended Phillips Exeter Academy before establishing a legal practice in Zanesville, Ohio. After serving in the Ohio House of Representatives, he was appointed as a U.S. Marshal. Cass also joined the Freemasons and would eventually co-found the Grand Lodge of Michigan. He fought at the Battle of the Thames in the War of 1812 and was appointed to govern Michigan Territory in 1813. He negotiated treaties with American tribes to open land for American settlement as part of the belief in the 19th century phrase &quot;manifest destiny&quot; at the time, and led a survey expedition into the northwest part of the territory.

Cass resigned as governor in 1831 to accept appointment as Secretary of War under Andrew Jackson. As Secretary of War, he helped implement Jackson&#x27;s policy of Indian removal. After serving as ambassador to France from 1836 to 1842, he unsuccessfully sought the presidential nomination at the 1844 Democratic National Convention; a deadlock between supporters of Cass and former President Martin Van Buren ended with the nomination of James K. Polk. In 1845, the Michigan Legislature elected Cass to the Senate, where he served until 1848. Cass&#x27;s nomination at the 1848 Democratic National Convention precipitated a split in the party, as Cass&#x27;s advocacy for popular sovereignty alienated the anti-slavery wing of the party. Van Buren led the Free Soil Party&#x27;s presidential ticket and appealed to many anti-slavery Democrats, possibly contributing to the victory of Whig nominee Zachary Taylor.

Cass returned to the Senate in 1849 and continued to serve until 1857 when he accepted appointment as the Secretary of State. He unsuccessfully sought to buy land from Mexico and sympathized with American filibusters in Latin America. Cass resigned from the Cabinet in December 1860 in protest of Buchanan&#x27;s handling of the threatened secession of several Southern states. Since his death in 1866, he has been commemorated in various ways, including with a statue in the National Statuary Hall.

==Early life==
Cass was born on October 9, 1782, in Exeter, New Hampshire, near the end of the American Revolution. His parents were Molly (née Gilman) Cass and Major Jonathan Cass, a Revolutionary War veteran who fought under General George Washington at Bunker Hill.

Cass attended the private Phillips Exeter Academy. In 1800, the family moved to Marietta, Ohio, part of a wave of westward migration after the end of the war and defeat of Native Americans in the Northwest Indian War. Cass studied law with Return J. Meigs Jr., was admitted to the bar, and began a practice in Zanesville.

==Beginning of Cass&#x27;s career==
In 1806, Cass was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives. The following year, President Thomas Jefferson appointed Cass as the U.S. Marshal for Ohio.

He joined the Freemasons, an increasingly popular fraternal organization in that period, being initiated as an Entered Apprentice in what was later American Union Lodge No.1 at Marietta on December 5, 1803. He achieved his Fellow Craft degree on April 2, 1804, and his Master Mason degree on May 7, 1804. On June 24, 1805, he was admitted as Charter member of the Lodge of Amity 105 (later No.5), Zanesville. He served as the first Worshipful Master of the Lodge of Amity in 1806. Cass was one of the founders of the Grand Lodge of Ohio, representing the Lodge of Amity at the first meeting on January 4, 1808. He was elected Deputy Grand Master on January 5, 1809, and Grand Master on January 3, 1810, January 8, 1811, and January 8, 1812.

==War of 1812==
===Engagement at bridge near Fort Malden===

After the War of 1812 broke out, Cass took command of the 3rd Ohio Volunteer Regiment. During the war, Cass conducted several military operations around the Canada–United States border. On July 16, 1812, a British force consisting of the 41st Regiment of Foot, 60 men of the Canadian Militia and a number of Indians were posted near Fort Malden. Cass and Colonel James Miller led a concealed American reconnaissance force near them. The British detected the Americans, and sent a party of Indians over a nearby bridge to draw them out; however, once the Indians crossed, the concealed Americans opened fire, wounding two and killing one. Cass and Miller send word to General William Hull, requesting permission to attack Fort Malden and hold it until reinforcements arrived. However, Hull, an indecisive officer, was unsupportive and refused to agree to their request, which led Cass and Miller to withdraw their men back to American lines.

===Second engagement at bridge near Fort Malden===

On July 19, 1812, Colonel Duncan McArthur with a reconnaissance force combined with 150 Ohio infantry troops under Cass were near the bridge leading to Fort Malden. Two British guns fired on the Americans and disabled an American cannon. The Americans captured two British soldiers after they crossed the bridge, before safely withdrawing with their prisoners.

===Hit-and-run attack on bridge at the Riviere aux Canards===
On July 28, 1812, Colonel Cass conducted a hit-and-run attack at the Rivière aux Canards driving back a band of Native Americans. The Americans killed one Native American and scalped him. Cass and his fellow Americans then withdrew safely.

===Battle of the Thames===
Cass became colonel of the 27th United States Infantry Regiment on February 20, 1813. Soon after, he was promoted to brigadier general in the Regular Army on March 12, 1813. Cass took part in the Battle of the Thames, which saw the death of Tecumseh. Cass resigned from the Army on May 1, 1814.

==Territorial Governor of Michigan==
As a reward for his military service, Cass was appointed Governor of the Michigan Territory by President James Madison on October 29, 1813, serving until 1831. As he was frequently traveling on business, several territorial secretaries often acted as governor in his place. During this period, he helped negotiate and implement treaties with Native American tribes in Michigan, by which they ceded substantial amounts of land. Some were given small reservations in the territory.

In 1817, Cass was one of the two commissioners (along with Duncan McArthur), who negotiated the Treaty of Fort Meigs, which was signed on September 29 with several Native American tribes of the region, under which they ceded large amounts of territory to the United States. This helped open up areas of Michigan to settlement by Euro-Americans. That same year, Cass was named to serve as Secretary of War under President James Monroe, but he declined the appointment.

In 1820, Cass led an expedition to the northwestern part of Michigan Territory, in the Great Lakes region in today&#x27;s northern Minnesota. Its purpose was to map the region and locate the source of the Mississippi River. The headwater of the great river was then unknown, resulting in an undefined border between the United States and British North America, which had been linked to the river. The Cass expedition erroneously identified what became known as Cass Lake as the Mississippi&#x27;s source. It was not until 1832 that Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, the Cass expedition&#x27;s geologist, identified nearby Lake Itasca as the headwater of the Mississippi.

Though the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 prohibited slavery in the Northwest Territory, which included what later became Michigan Territory, a small number of slaves continued to reside in Michigan until it achieved statehood. Despite his later claims to the contrary, as territorial governor, Cass is known to have owned at least one slave, a household servant, as evidenced by 1818 correspondence between him and Alexander Macomb. Slavery continued in Michigan until admission to the Union in 1837, when its first state constitution outlawed slavery statewide.

==Secretary of War and expediter of Indian removal==
In 1830, Cass published an article in the &quot;North American Review&quot; that passionately argued that Indians were &quot;inherently inferior&quot; to whites, and incapable of being civilized and thus should be removed from the eastern United States. This article caught the attention and approval of Andrew Jackson. On August 1, 1831, Cass resigned as governor of the Michigan Territory to take the post of Secretary of War under President Andrew Jackson, a position he would hold until 1836. Cass was a central figure in implementing the Indian removal policy of the Jackson administration; Congress had passed the Indian Removal Act in 1830. While it was directed chiefly against the Southeastern tribes, especially the Five Civilized Tribes, it also affected tribes in Ohio, Illinois, and other areas east of the Mississippi River. Most were forced to Indian Territory in present-day Kansas and Oklahoma, but a number of bands negotiated being allowed to remain in Michigan.

==U.S. Minister to France==
At the end of his term, President Jackson appointed Cass to succeed Edward Livingston as the U.S. Minister to France on October 4, 1836. He presented his credentials on December 1, 1836, and served until he left his post on November 12, 1842, when he was succeeded by William R. King, who later became the 13th Vice President of the United States under President Franklin Pierce.

==Presidential ambitions and U.S. Senate==
In the 1844 Democratic convention, Cass stood as a candidate for the presidential nomination, losing on the 9th ballot to dark horse candidate James K. Polk.

Cass was elected by the state legislature to represent Michigan in the United States Senate, serving in 1845–1848. He served as chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs in the 30th Congress.

In 1848, he resigned from the Senate to run for president in the 1848 election. William Orlando Butler was selected as his running mate. Cass was a leading supporter of the doctrine of popular sovereignty, which held that the (white male) American citizens who lived in a territory should decide whether to permit slavery there. His nomination caused a split in the Democratic Party, leading many antislavery Northern Democrats to join the Free Soil Party, which nominated former President Martin Van Buren.

After losing the election to Zachary Taylor, Cass was returned by the state legislature to the Senate, serving from 1849 to 1857. He was the first non-incumbent Democratic presidential candidate to lose an election and the first Democrat who was unsuccessful in his bid to succeed another Democrat as president. 
Apart from James Buchanan&#x27;s election to succeed Franklin Pierce in 1856, subsequent Democrats who attempted election to succeed a fellow Democrat as president all failed in their bid to do so. 
Cass made another bid for president in 1852 but neither he nor rival Democratic contenders Buchanan and Stephen Douglas secured a majority of delegates’ votes at the Democratic Convention in Baltimore, and the party went with Franklin Pierce instead.

==U.S. Secretary of State==

On March 6, 1857, President James Buchanan appointed Cass to serve as Secretary of State as a consolation prize for his previous presidential runs. Although retaining incumbent Secretary of State William L. Marcy was considered the best option by many, Buchanan made it clear that he did not want to keep anyone from the Pierce Administration. Moreover, Marcy had opposed his earlier presidential bids, and was in poor health in any event, ultimately dying in July 1857. Cass, aged 75, was seen by most as too old for such a demanding position and was thought to likely be little more than a figurehead. Buchanan, weighing many of the other options for Secretary of State, considered that Cass was the best choice to avoid political infighting and sectional tensions. Buchanan wrote a flattering letter offering him the post of Secretary of State, commenting that he was remarkably active and energetic for his advanced age. Cass, who was retiring from the Senate, but not eager to leave Washington and return home to Michigan, immediately accepted.

Taking the position, Cass promised to refrain from making anti-British remarks in public (having served in the War of 1812, Cass had a low opinion of London). Most assumed Cass was a temporary Secretary of State until a younger, more fit man could be found, however, he ultimately served for all but the final four months of Buchanan&#x27;s administration. As expected, the aged Cass largely delegated major decision-making to subordinates, but eagerly signed his name on papers and dispatches penned by them. 

While sympathetic to American filibusters in Central America, he was instrumental in having Commodore Hiram Paulding removed from command for his landing of Marines in Nicaragua and compelling the extradition of William Walker to the United States. Cass attempted to buy more land from Mexico, but faced opposition from both Mexico and congressional leaders. He also negotiated a final settlement to the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty, limiting U.S. and British control of Latin American countries. The chiefs of Raiatea and Tahaa in the South Pacific, refusing to accept the rule of King Tamatoa V, unsuccessfully petitioned the United States to accept the islands under a protectorate in June 1858.

Cass resigned on December 14, 1860, because of what he considered Buchanan&#x27;s failure to protect federal interests in the South and failure to mobilize the federal military, actions that might have averted the threatened secession of Southern states.

==Personal life==
On May 26, 1806, Cass married Elizabeth Spencer (1786–1853), the daughter of Dr. Joseph Spencer Jr. and Deborah (née Seldon) Spencer. Her paternal grandfather was Joseph Spencer, a Continental Congressman who was a major general in the Continental Army. Lewis and Elizabeth were the parents of seven children, five of whom lived past infancy:

* Isabella Cass (1805–1879), who married Theodorus Marinus Roest van Limburg, a Dutch journalist, diplomat, and politician.
* Elizabeth Selden Cass (1812–1832)
* Lewis Cass Jr. (1814–1878), who served as an army officer and as U.S. Chargé d&#x27;Affaires and Minister to the Papal States.
* Mary Sophia Cass (1812–1882), who married Army officer Augustus Canfield, an officer of the Corps of Topographical Engineers.
* Matilda Frances Cass (1818–1898), who married Henry Ledyard, the mayor of Detroit.
* Ellen Cass (1821–1824), who died young.
* Spencer Cass (1828-1828), who died in infancy.

Cass died on June 17, 1866, in Detroit, Michigan. He is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit.

===Descendants===
Through his daughter Mary, he was the great-grandfather of Cass Canfield (longtime president and chairman of Harper &amp; Brothers, later Harper &amp; Row).

Through his daughter Matilda, he was the grandfather of Elizabeth Cass Ledyard (wife of Francis Wayland Goddard); Henry Brockholst Ledyard Jr. (who was president of the Michigan Central Railroad); Susan Livingston Ledyard (wife of Hamilton Bullock Tompkins); Lewis Cass Ledyard (a prominent lawyer with Carter Ledyard &amp; Milburn who was the personal counsel of J. Pierpont Morgan); and Matilda Spancer Ledyard.

Cass&#x27;s great-great-grandson, Republican Thomas Cass Ballenger, represented North Carolina&#x27;s 10th Congressional District from 1986 to 2005.

==Monuments and Commemoration==

* A statue of Lewis Cass is one of the two that were submitted by Michigan to the National Statuary Hall collection in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. It stands in the National Statuary Hall room.
* The Liberty ship SS &quot;Lewis Cass&quot;

* Cass Avenue in Detroit. Cass Avenue in Mt. Clemens.
* The Lewis Cass Legacy Society, which supports The Michigan Masonic Charitable Foundation, was named for his support of Michigan Freemasonry.
* Bartow County, Georgia, was originally named Cass County after Lewis Cass, but was changed in 1861 after Francis Bartow died as a Confederate war hero and due to Cass&#x27;s alleged opposition to slavery, even though he was an advocate of states&#x27; rights via the doctrine of popular sovereignty.

<text>Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) or heart-lung machine, also called the pump or CPB pump, is a machine that temporarily takes over the function of the heart and lungs during open-heart surgery by maintaining the circulation of blood and oxygen throughout the body. As such it is an extracorporeal device.

CPB is operated by a perfusionist. The machine mechanically circulates and oxygenates blood throughout the patient&#x27;s body while bypassing the heart and lungs allowing the surgeon to work in a bloodless surgical field.

==Uses==

CPB is commonly used in operations or surgical procedures involving the heart. The technique allows the surgical team to oxygenate and circulate the patient&#x27;s blood, thus allowing the surgeon to operate safely on the heart. In many operations, such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), the heart is arrested, due to the degree of the difficulty of operating on a beating heart.

Operations requiring the opening of the chambers of the heart, for example mitral valve repair or replacement, requires the use of CPB. This is to avoid engulfing air systemically, and to provide a bloodless field to increase visibility for the surgeon. The machine pumps the blood and, using an oxygenator, allows red blood cells to pick up oxygen, as well as allowing carbon dioxide levels to decrease. This mimics the function of the heart and the lungs, respectively.

=== Hypothermia ===
CPB can be used for the induction of total body hypothermia, a state in which the body can be maintained for up to 45 minutes without perfusion (blood flow). If blood flow is stopped at normal body temperature, permanent brain damage can occur in three to four minutes — death may follow. Similarly, CPB can be used to rewarm individuals who have hypothermia. This rewarming method of using CPB is successful if the core temperature of the patient is above 16 °C.

=== Cooled blood ===
The blood is cooled during CPB and is returned to the body. The cooled blood slows the body&#x27;s basal metabolic rate, decreasing its demand for oxygen. Cooled blood usually has a higher viscosity, but the various crystalloid or colloidal solutions that are used to prime the bypass tubing serve to dilute the blood. Maintaining appropriate blood pressure for organs is a challenge, but it is monitored carefully during the procedure. Hypothermia is also maintained (if necessary), and the body temperature is usually kept at .

=== Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ===
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a simplified version of the heart lung machine that includes a centrifugal pump and an oxygenator to temporarily take over the function of heart and/or the lungs. ECMO is useful for post-cardiac surgery patients with cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction, patients with acute pulmonary failure, massive pulmonary embolisms, lung trauma from infections, and a range of other problems that impair cardiac or pulmonary function.

ECMO gives the heart and/or lungs time to repair and recover, but is only a temporary solution. Patients with terminal conditions, cancer, severe nervous system damage, uncontrolled sepsis, and other conditions may not be candidates for ECMO.

== Usage scenarios ==
CPB is used in scenarios such as:
*Coronary artery bypass surgery
*Cardiac valve repair and/or replacement (aortic valve, mitral valve, tricuspid valve, pulmonic valve)
*Repair of large septal defects (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, atrioventricular septal defect)
*Repair and/or palliation of congenital heart defects (Tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great vessels)
*Transplantation (heart transplantation, lung transplantation, heart–lung transplantation, liver transplantation)
*Repair of some large aneurysms (aortic aneurysms, cerebral aneurysms)
*Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy 
*Pulmonary thrombectomy
*Isolated limb perfusion

== Contraindications and special considerations ==
There are no absolute contraindications to cardiopulmonary bypass. However, there are several factors that need to be considered by the care team when planning an operation.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis are potentially life-threatening conditions associated with the administration of heparin. In both of these conditions, antibodies against heparin are formed which causes platelet activation and the formation of blood clots. Because heparin is typically used in CPB, patients who are known to have the antibodies responsible for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis require alternative forms of anticoagulation. Bivalirudin is the most studied heparin-alternative in people with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis requiring CPB.

A small percentage of patients, such as those with an antithrombin III deficiency, may exhibit resistance to heparin. In these patients, patients may need additional heparin, fresh frozen plasma, or other blood products such as recombinant anti-thrombin III to achieve adequate anticoagulation.

A persistent left superior vena cava is thoracic system variation in which the left-sided vena cava fails to involute during normal development. It is the most common variation of the thoracic venous system, occurring in approximately 0.3% of the population. The abnormality is often detected on pre-operative imaging studies, but may also be discovered intra-operatively. A persistent left superior vena cava may make it difficult to achieve proper venous drainage or deliver of retrograde cardioplegia. Management of a persistent left superior vena cava during CPB depends on factors such as the size and drainage site of the vena cava variation.

Cerebral perfusion, brain blood circulation, always has to be under consideration when using CPB. Due to the nature of CPB and its impact on circulation, the body&#x27;s own cerebral autoregulation is affected. The occurrence and attempts of preventing this issue has been addressed many times, but still without complete understanding.

==Risks and complications==

CPB is not without risk, and there are a number of associated problems. As a consequence, CPB is only used during the several hours a cardiac surgery may take. CPB is known to activate the coagulation cascade and stimulate inflammatory mediators, leading to hemolysis and coagulopathies. This problem worsens as complement proteins build on the membrane oxygenators. For this reason, most oxygenators come with a manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation that they are only used for a maximum of six hours, although they are sometimes used for up to ten hours, with care being taken to ensure they do not clot off and stop working. For longer periods than this, a membrane oxygenator is used, which can be in operation for up to 31 days — such as in a Taiwanese case, for 16 days, after which the patient received a heart transplant.

The most common complication associated with CPB is a protamine reaction during anticoagulation reversal. There are three types of protamine reactions, and each may cause life-threatening hypotension (type I), anaphylaxis (type II), or pulmonary hypertension (type III). Patients with prior exposure to protamine, such as those who have had a previous vasectomy (protamine is contained in sperm) or diabetics (protamine is contained in neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH) insulin formulations), are at an increased risk of type II protamine reactions due to cross-sensitivity. Because protamine is a fast-acting drug, it is typically given slowly to allow for monitoring of possible reactions. The first step in management of a protamine reaction is to immediately stop the protamine infusion. Corticosteroids are used for all types of protamine reactions. Chlorphenamine is used for type II (anaphylactic) reactions. For type III reactions, heparin is redosed and the patient may need to go back on bypass.

CPB may contribute to immediate cognitive decline. The heart-lung blood circulation system and the connection surgery itself release a variety of debris into the bloodstream, including bits of blood cells, tubing, and plaque. For example, when surgeons clamp and connect the aorta to tubing, resulting emboli may block blood flow and cause mini strokes. Other heart surgery factors related to mental damage may be events of hypoxia, high or low body temperature, abnormal blood pressure, irregular heart rhythms, and fever after surgery.

==Components==
Cardiopulmonary bypass devices consist of two main functional units: the pump and the oxygenator. These units remove oxygen-depleted blood from a patient&#x27;s body and replace it with oxygen-rich blood through a series of tubes, or hoses. Additionally, a heat exchanger is used to control body temperature by heating &quot;or&quot; cooling the blood in the circuit. All components of the circuit are coated internally by heparin or another anticoagulant to prevent clotting within the circuit.

===Tubing===
The components of the CPB circuit are interconnected by a series of tubes made of silicone rubber or PVC.

===Pumps===

====Centrifugal pump====
Many CPB circuits now employ a centrifugal pump for the maintenance and control of blood flow during CPB. By altering the speed of revolution (RPM) of the pump head, blood flow is produced by centrifugal force. This type of pumping action is considered to be superior to the roller pump because it is thought to prevent over-pressurization, clamping, or kinking of lines, and causes less damage to blood products (hemolysis, etc.).

====Roller pump====
The pump console usually comprises several rotating, motor-driven pumps that peristaltically &quot;massage&quot; the tubing. This action gently propels the blood through the tubing. This is commonly referred to as a roller pump, or peristaltic pump. The pumps are more affordable than their centrifugal counterparts but are susceptible to over-pressurization if the lines become clamped or kinked. They are also more likely to cause a massive air embolism and require constant, close supervision by the perfusionist.

===Oxygenator===
The oxygenator is designed to add oxygen to infused blood and remove some carbon dioxide from the venous blood.

=== Heat exchangers ===
Because hypothermia is frequently used in CPB (to reduce metabolic demands), heat exchangers are implemented to warm and cool blood within the circuit. Heating and cooling is accomplished by passing the line through a warm or ice water bath, and a separate heat exchanger is required for the cardioplegia line.

===Cannulae===
Multiple cannulae are sewn into the patient&#x27;s body in a variety of locations, depending on the type of surgery. A venous cannula removes oxygen depleted venous blood from a patient&#x27;s body, and an arterial cannula infuses oxygen-rich blood into the arterial system. The main determinants of cannula size selection is determined by the patient&#x27;s &quot;size&quot; and &quot;weight&quot;, &quot;anticipated flow rate&quot;, and the &quot;size of the vessel&quot; being cannulated. A Cardioplegia cannula delivers a Cardioplegia solution to cause the heart to stop beating.

Some commonly used cannulation sites:
===Cardioplegia===

Cardioplegia is a fluid solution used to protect the heart during CPB. It is delivered via a cannula to the opening of the coronary arteries (usually by way of the aortic root) and/or to the cardiac veins (by way of the coronary sinus). These delivery methods are referred to antegrade or retrograde, respectively. Cardioplegia solution protects the heart by arresting, or stopping the heart. This then decreases the heart&#x27;s metabolic demand. There are multiple types of cardioplegia solutions, but most work by inhibiting fast sodium currents in the heart, which prevent conduction of the action potential. Other types of solutions act by inhibiting calcium&#x27;s actions on myocytes.

==Technique==

===Pre-operative planning===
CPB requires significant forethought before surgery. In particular, the cannulation, cooling, and cardio-protective strategies must be coordinated between the surgeon, anesthesiologist, perfusionist, and nursing staff.

==== Cannulation strategy ====
The cannulation strategy varies on several operation-specific and patient-specific details. Nonetheless, a surgeon will place a cannula in the right atrium, vena cava, or femoral vein to withdraw blood from the body. The cannula used to return oxygenated blood is usually inserted in the ascending aorta, but there is a possibility that it is inserted in the femoral artery, axillary artery, or brachiocephalic artery according to the demand of the surgery. After the cannula is inserted, venous blood is drained from the body by the cannula into a reservoir. This blood is then filtered, cooled, or warmed, and oxygenated before it returns to the body through a mechanical pump.

==== Intra-operative technique ====
A CPB circuit must be primed with fluid and all air expunged from the arterial line/cannula before connection to the patient. The circuit is primed with a crystalloid solution and sometimes blood products are also added. Prior to cannulation (typically after opening the pericardium when using central cannulation), heparin or another anticoagulant is administered until the activated clotting time is above 480 seconds.

The arterial cannulation site is inspected for calcification or other disease. Preoperative imaging or an ultrasound probe may be used to help identify aortic calcifications that could potentially become dislodged and cause an occlusion or stroke. Once the cannulation site has been deemed safe, two concentric, diamond-shaped pursestring sutures are placed in the distal ascending aorta. A stab incision with a scalpel is made within the pursestrings and the arterial cannula is passed through the incision. It is important the cannula is passed perpendicular to the aorta to avoid creating an aortic dissection. The pursestrings sutures are cinched around the cannula using a tourniquet and secured to the cannula. At this point, the perfusionist advances the arterial line of the CPB circuit and the surgeon connects the arterial line coming from the patient to the arterial line coming from the CPB machine. Care must be taken to ensure no air is in the circuit when the two are connected, or else the patient could develop an air embolism. Other sites for arterial cannulation include the axillary artery, brachiocephalic artery, or femoral artery.

Aside from the differences in location, venous cannulation is performed similarly to arterial cannulation. Since calcification of the venous system is less common, the inspection or use of an ultrasound for calcification at the cannulation sites is unnecessary. Also, because the venous system is under much less pressure than the arterial system, only a single suture is required to hold the cannula in place. If only a single cannula is to be used (dual-stage cannulation), it is passed through the right atrial appendage, through the tricuspid valve, and into the inferior vena cava. If two cannula are required (single-stage cannulation), the first one is typically passed through the superior vena cava and the second through the inferior vena cava. The femoral vein may also be cannulated in select patients.

If the heart must be stopped for the operation, cardioplegia cannulas are also required. Antegrade cardioplegia (forward flowing, through the heart&#x27;s arteries), retrograde cardioplegia (backwards flowing, through the heart&#x27;s veins), or both types may be used depending on the operation and surgeon preference. For antegrade cardioplegia, a small incision is made in the aorta proximal to the arterial cannulation site (between the heart and arterial cannulation site) and the cannula is placed through this to deliver cardioplegia to the coronary arteries. For retrograde cardioplegia, an incision is made on the posterior (back) surface of the heart through the right ventricle. The cannula is placed in this incision, passed through the tricuspid valve, and into the coronary sinus. The cardioplegia lines are connected to the CPB machine.

At this point, the patient is ready to go on bypass. Blood from the venous cannula(s) enters the CPB machine by gravity where it is oxygenated and cooled (if necessary) before returning to the body through the arterial cannula. Cardioplegia can now be administered to stop the heart, and a cross-clamp is placed across the aorta between the arterial cannula and cardioplegia cannula to prevent the arterial blood from flowing backwards into the heart. Setting appropriate blood pressure targets to maintain the health and function of the organs including the brain and kidney are important considerations.

Once the patient is ready to come off of bypass support, the cross-clamp and cannulas are removed and protamine sulfate is administered to reverse the anticoagulative effects of heparin.

==History==

The Austrian-German physiologist Maximilian von Frey constructed an early prototype of a heart-lung machine in 1885. This was conducted at Carl Ludwig&#x27;s Physiological Institute of the University of Leipzig. However, such machines were not feasible before the discovery of heparin in 1916, which prevents blood coagulation.

The Soviet scientist Sergei Brukhonenko developed a heart-lung machine for total body perfusion in 1926 named the &quot;Autojektor&quot;, which was used in experiments with dogs, some of which were showcased in the 1940 film &quot;Experiments in the Revival of Organisms&quot;. A team of scientists at the University of Birmingham (including Eric Charles, a chemical engineer) were among the pioneers of this technology.

For four years work was undertaken to improve the machine, and on April 5, 1951, Dr. Clarence Dennis led the team at the University of Minnesota Medical Center that conducted the first human operation involving open cardiotomy with temporary mechanical takeover of both heart and lung functions. The patient did not survive due to an unexpected complex congenital heart defect, but the machine had proved to be workable. One member of the team was Dr Russell M. Nelson, (who later became president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), and he performed the first open heart surgery in Utah in November 1951 which was successful.

The first successful mechanical support of left ventricular function was performed on July 3, 1952, by Forest Dewey Dodrill using a machine co-developed with General Motors, the Dodrill-GMR. The machine was later used to support the right ventricular function.

The first successful open heart procedure on a human utilizing the heart lung machine was performed by John Gibbon and Frank F. Allbritten Jr. on May 6, 1953, at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia. Gibbon&#x27;s machine was further developed into a reliable instrument by a surgical team led by John W. Kirklin at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota in the mid-1950s.

The oxygenator was first conceptualized in the 17th century by Robert Hooke and developed into practical extracorporeal oxygenators by French and German experimental physiologists in the 19th century. Bubble oxygenators have no intervening barrier between blood and oxygen, these are called &#x27;direct contact&#x27; oxygenators. Membrane oxygenators introduce a gas-permeable membrane between blood and oxygen that decreases the blood trauma of direct-contact oxygenators. Much work since the 1960s focused on overcoming the gas exchange handicap of the membrane barrier, leading to the development of high-performance microporous hollow-fibre oxygenators that eventually replaced direct-contact oxygenators in cardiac theatres.

In 1983, Ken Litzie patented a closed emergency heart bypass system which reduced circuit and component complexity. This device improved patient survival after cardiac arrest because it could be rapidly deployed in non-surgical settings.

<doc id="261829" wikidata="Q1130153" url="?curid=261829" title="FlyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines">
<text>flyLAL (also known as Lithuanian Airlines and LAL) was the national airline of Lithuania, based in Vilnius. It operated domestic and international scheduled services from its main base at Vilnius International Airport. Due to financial difficulties the airline suspended operations on 17 January 2009.

== History ==
===Establishment and privatization===

The airline was established as government-owned Lietuvos Avialinijos (Lithuanian Airlines) on 20 September 1991, shortly after Lithuania&#x27;s independence from the Soviet Union. Initially, it operated using aircraft of the Aeroflot fleet located in Vilnius (twelve Yakovlev Yak-42, seven Tupolev Tu-134, four Antonov An-24, and three Antonov An-26 airliners). During the period from 1991 to 1993, the airline re-oriented its route network from the countries of the former Soviet Union to Western Europe. From the beginning, the airline faced stiff competition with Lufthansa and Scandinavian Airlines.

In December 1991 Lithuanian Airlines sub-leased its first Boeing 737-200 from Malév Hungarian Airlines. Six months later, the aircraft was leased directly from Guinness Peat Aviation and bore the registration LY-GPA.

After a decade of loss-making operations, abortive plans to launch a trans-Atlantic service, and the widely criticized sale of landing slots at London Heathrow to cover some US$20 million in debt, Lithuanian Airlines was privatized in 2005. The airline was acquired by &quot;LAL Investicijų Valdymas&quot; (LAL Investment Management), a wholly owned subsidiary of the FlyLal Group, for 27 million Lithuanian litas. The airline was subsequently renamed flyLAL–Lithuanian Airlines. In February 2007, flyLAL was recognized as most punctual airline at Gatwick Airport in London. It had 542 employees as of March 2007. As of December 2007, the airline had three Boeing 737-300, five Boeing 737-500, and four SAAB 2000 airliners and had plans for further expansion. During 2007, the number of passengers grew by 14% to 526,000. In 2008, charter flight services were transferred to sister company FlyLal Charters, leaving only scheduled flights for FlyLal.

===Bankruptcy===
During 2008, FlyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines suffered from a price war with airBaltic and slowing of the travel industry due to the Great Recession. Despite the crisis, the number of passengers grew by 61% during 2008. In December 2008, the company admitted to suffering financial difficulties and having debts of 86 million litas (26.1 mln euros). It offered 51% of its shares to the Government of Lithuania for a symbolic sum of 1 litas in exchange for a state guarantee of its debt. The government declined the offer.

Shortly afterwards FlyLal announced that it would sell 100% of shares to SCH Swiss Capital Holdings, a previously unknown company registered in December 2008. The company was sold for US$1 million effective 23 January 2009. The new owners agreed to advance 1 million euros to cover some of the debts and prevent the cancellation of FlyLal&#x27;s operating licence. When the advance was not received, the deal was terminated and FlyLal announced termination of its activities effective 17 January 2009. Another proposal for a government bailout was rejected on 23 January 2009. The bankruptcy of FlyLAL significantly reduced the number of direct flights from Vilnius, from 28 to 14 destinations, and the number of passengers at Vilnius Airport decreased by 43 percent.

<doc id="261835" wikidata="Q273502" url="?curid=261835" title="Anne Dudley">
<text>Anne Jennifer Dudley (née Beckingham; born 7 May 1956) is an English composer, keyboardist, conductor and pop musician. She was the first BBC Concert Orchestra&#x27;s Composer in Association in 2001. She has worked in the classical and pop genres, as a film composer, and was one of the core members of the synth-pop band Art of Noise. In 1998, Dudley won an Oscar for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score for &quot;The Full Monty&quot;. In addition to over twenty other film scores, in 2012 she served as music producer for the film version of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, also acting as arranger and composing some new additional music.

==Career==
Dudley was born in Chatham, Kent. She attended Eltham Hill Grammar School for Girls. She graduated with a master&#x27;s in music from King&#x27;s College London in 1978. Trained as a classical performer, she moved into the competitive commercial field as a session musician, where her professional relationship with Trevor Horn began. In 1982, Dudley contributed to the Horn-produced &quot;The Lexicon of Love&quot; album by ABC. She went from fleshing out keyboard parts to scoring the album&#x27;s orchestrations (which were, according to Horn, her first-ever string arrangements) and also co-writing one of the songs.

Dudley was a founding member of the band Art of Noise in 1983, which helped pioneer the use of sampling within the pop genre. Their hits include &quot;Beat Box&quot; (1984), &quot;Moments in Love&quot; (1985), &quot;Close (to the Edit)&quot; (1984), &quot;Paranoimia&quot; (1986), which featured a monologue about insomnia by the artificial intelligence character, Max Headroom, and, with Tom Jones, &quot;Kiss&quot;, a Top 10 in 1988. Art of Noise also produced the theme tune to the ITV game show &quot;The Krypton Factor&quot; which was used between 1986 and 1993. &quot;(Theme From) The Krypton Factor&quot; was composed and recorded in 1986 and was reworked as &quot;Crusoe&quot; on their 1987 album.

Dudley&#x27;s association with Trevor Horn and Art of Noise led on to working with artists such as Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Seal, Marc Almond, Rod Stewart, Robbie Williams and, more recently, Siphiwo. She has co-written songs with Malcolm McLaren (&quot;Buffalo Gals&quot;), Cathy Dennis (&quot;Too Many Walls&quot;), and a 1930s-inspired song with Sting called &quot;This Was Never Meant to Be&quot;.

She produced the Tom Jones hit &quot;You Can Leave Your Hat On&quot; (1988) and a Debbie Harry single &quot;Strike Me Pink&quot; (1993).

In 1989, Dudley produced and conducted the string arrangements for the eponymous debut album by Welsh pop duo Waterfront. Her intricate production is demonstrated most notably on the song &quot;Nature of Love&quot;, which was released as a single in both the UK and US. Another collaboration in 1989 was with Neil Tennant from Pet Shop Boys and Bernard Sumner of New Order; Dudley contributed the lush string arrangements on their debut Electronic release, &quot;Getting Away with It&quot;, which peaked at #12 in the UK in December 1989, and #38 in the US in 1990.

Dudley produced two tracks on the 2002 Opera Babes album &quot;Beyond Imagination&quot; (ranking No. 1 on the UK classical charts for 11 weeks, and No. 4 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts). In 2004, she produced the album &quot;Voice&quot; for Alison Moyet. The album, an eclectic collection of cover versions, reached No. 7 on the UK Albums Chart.

Her works for orchestra include &quot;Northern Lights&quot;, a 14-minute reflection of Norway&#x27;s Aurora Borealis for full orchestra, performed in 2005 and 2006 at the Royal Festival Hall and broadcast on BBC Radio 3&#x27;s &quot;Late Junction&quot; programme in May 2005. Her first commission as Composer in Association with the BBC Concert Orchestra was &quot;Music and Silence&quot;, inspired by the novel of the same name by Rose Tremain and first performed at The Royal Festival Hall in 2002. Dudley arranged Bach&#x27;s Chaconne from Partita in D minor for piano trio, and a recording by the Eroica Trio appears on their &quot;Baroque&quot; album. Her album &quot;Ancient and Modern&quot;, with modern versions of some traditional hymns and Bach chorales, was released in 1999. She was the musical director for &quot;Bill Bailey&#x27;s Remarkable Guide to the Orchestra&quot;, first performed in Brighton then at the Royal Albert Hall in 2008, which was recorded and released as a DVD in December 2009. The show was toured in 2009 with eight different regional orchestras participating. It involved the orchestra playing the Nokia theme tune and a french horn concerto evolving into the theme from &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

Dudley collaborated with Sam Taylor-Wood in producing the sound and video installation &quot;Sigh&quot; at the White Cube in 2008. This work featured the BBC Concert Orchestra on eight large projected screens, miming to Dudley&#x27;s score.

<text>Nicholas William Budgen (3 November 1937 – 26 October 1998), often called Nick Budgen, was a British Conservative Party politician.

==Early life and career==
Named after St Nicholas Church in Newport, Shropshire of which his grandfather was a priest, Budgen was baptised at Lichfield Cathedral by his grandfather, who had also baptised Enoch Powell, as well as marrying his parents. Thirty-seven years later Budgen would succeed Powell as the Conservative member of Parliament for Wolverhampton South West.

Budgen was educated at St Edward&#x27;s School in Oxford and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Budgen was raised by his grandfather after his father George had been killed during the Second World War at Tobruk on 16 June 1942, one of his uncles having been killed during the First World War and another during the Second World War at Burma in March 1945. 

As a member of Cambridge University Conservative Association, Peter Temple Morris a future Conservative MP, recalls that the first time Harold Macmillan used his famous quote events, dear boy, events was in response to a question Budgen had asked in a small group discussion (&quot;Across the Floor: A life in dissenting politics&quot;, page 36, published 2015 - Peter Temple Morris).

During his national service he rose to the rank of lieutenant in the North Staffordshire Regiment, before transferring to the Staffordshire Yeomanry in 1959. He became a barrister at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1962. Bugden was also a very keen amateur rider under National Hunt rules and in the spring of 1971, won two steeplechases (at Market Rasen and Stratford) on his mare Jocelin, who later became the dam of the very useful steeplechaser Brown Chamberlin.

==Political career==
In the 1970 general election he stood for the Conservatives in Birmingham Small Heath, but failed to gain election. When the Conservative MP Enoch Powell left the party and resigned from his seat over their policy on the EEC, only six weeks before the 1974 general election, Budgen was selected to stand for the Conservatives in Powell&#x27;s old seat: Wolverhampton South West.

In 1975 he voted to remain in the Common Market. In 1981 he was made a Conservative whip, at the time a sure way of becoming a minister. On 8 May 1982, however, he resigned as a whip over his opposition to the creation of a Northern Ireland Assembly with no government powers. However &quot;The Spectator&quot; selected him as their 1984 Backbencher of the Year. His speeches in November 1985 against the Anglo-Irish Agreement persuaded his cousin Ian Gow to resign as a minister from Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government.

According to Michael Brown, who was at the time a government whip, Nick Budgen was the only critic of the March 1988 Budget, which contained many &quot;giveaways&quot; and led to high inflation and the 1990 recession. Brown described the situation in the Commons tea room after the budget as one of congratulatory atmosphere until Nick Budgen entered and proceeded to tell those present &quot;It is the most irresponsible budget I have ever heard, it will be downhill from now on. In one fell swoop Mr Lawson has squandered five years of responsible economic management&quot;.

He was also opposed to immigration to the UK and on 10 October 1989, at the Conservative Party Conference, he, with Tim Janman MP, and Jonathan Guinness (in the chair), addressed a controversial fringe meeting organized by the Young Monday Club, advertised as &quot;The End of the English? – Immigration and Repatriation&quot;.

Charles Moore described at Budgen&#x27;s memorial service how he once rang Budgen pretending to be a racist constituent. He said that Budgen said he supported a firm immigration policy, but when pushed to agree that all immigrants should be sent home, he forcefully defended their right to be in Britain. &quot;His distaste was palpable. I can think of many more liberal-minded MPs who might have given less firm answers to someone they thought might vote for them,&quot; he said. Conversely, Labour MP and one-time Minister for Europe Denis MacShane described Budgen as a &quot;filthy little racist&quot; in his diaries.

Budgen came to prominence in the 1990s when he was one of the Maastricht Rebels. These eight MPs had had the Conservative whip removed for their anti-EU stance and had taken to having their own policy meetings, leading former pro-EU Prime Minister Edward Heath to describe them as &quot;a party within a party&quot;. To Budgen the European question was an issue far more important than mere party loyalty. He had a contemptuous attitude towards both party and his leaders, having the second most rebellious voting record in the House of Commons for the period from 1979 to 1997. He is quoted as saying, &quot;you know, this is a government you can push&quot; and was acutely aware that John Major&#x27;s government was reliant upon the right-wing of its party because of its small majority in the House of Commons.

To this end, he helped lead a hardcore of approximately 50 right-wing Conservative Party MPs to influence government policy on Northern Ireland and Europe among other things. His hard line on the Northern Ireland situation was perhaps stiffened by the IRA murder of his cousin Ian Gow MP, who bled to death in his wife&#x27;s arms in 1990. He was popular with right-wingers not only for his intelligence but also because he had been campaigning against the UK&#x27;s gradual European drift since he resigned as a Whip in 1983.

The day after a conciliatory article in &quot;The Times&quot; by Budgen, John Major returned the Conservative whip to the rebels. Additionally, of &#x27;the whipless eight&#x27;, he was the only one to vote with the government on VAT on fuel in November 1994; the government were, however, defeated, forcing the then Chancellor Ken Clarke to return to Parliament with a &quot;mini budget&quot;, an unprecedented event.

It was Budgen who first mooted the idea of a referendum on the European Single Currency in 1993, with his proposed European Currency (Referendum) Bill.

Budgen was also a leading member of the Treasury Select Committee, who questioned every tax rise and attacked Kenneth Clarke as being &quot;intellectually dishonest&quot;. It was his position on this committee that persuaded him that the Bank of England should be made independent of political interference, this led to his private members bill in 1994, an attempt to privatise the Bank of England. The bill failed; however, in 1997 when the Labour Party was in government, it made the Bank of England independent as one of its first measures.

Budgen was also vociferous in protecting the rights of gun owners following the Dunblane massacre. His speech was described in &quot;The Guardian&quot; by columnist Simon Hoggart as &quot;one of the last great parliamentary speeches&quot;. The Dunblane bill created a situation where small calibre pistols were illegal in the UK (apart from a 3-week period in 2002 for the Commonwealth Games being held in Manchester, with British teams being forced to practise in France).

Due to his support for a referendum on the question of European integration, James Goldsmith&#x27;s Referendum Party decided not to run a candidate against him. Budgen had in fact suggested to the seatless former Conservative Government minister Alan Clark that he should stand for the Referendum Party. He had said that the Conservatives &quot;in the West Midlands will be running on alternative manifesto&quot;, presumably meaning with other local Maastricht Rebels, Christopher Gill (Ludlow) and Richard Shepherd (Aldridge &amp; Brownhills). Despite losing with a 9.9% swing from the Conservatives to Labour, of the 144 seats that Labour gained from the Conservatives it had the joint-tenth lowest swing, and was one of only 13 seats that changed hands with a swing in single figures.

Whilst Budgen was in favour of limiting immigration and opposed a ban on handguns, he voted against capital punishment.

Budgen was a keen huntsman. He had hunted in 29 of the UK&#x27;s counties, and in his youth was well known as a particularly fearless rider; he wrote regularly for &quot;Horse and Hound&quot; and occasionally for the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot; and &quot;The Irish Times&quot;. Budgen was described in the Commons by one former minister as being &quot;worth ten placeman&quot; and by the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; as the &quot;late, great Nicholas Budgen&quot;. He seemed to take great joy in continuing Wolverhampton South West&#x27;s feud (begun by Enoch Powell) with Edward Heath, heckling him at any opportunity.

Powell had let it be known that he would refuse a peerage while Heath was still in the Commons, and the latter refused to retire from the Commons for so long as he thought Powell might have a chance of a peerage. According to Julian Critchley, Budgen purchased his suits from Oxfam and rarely bought anyone a drink.

Nicholas Budgen died of liver cancer at Stafford General Hospital on 26 October 1998. His funeral service was near his Lichfield farm at Lichfield Cathedral, where his grandfather had been Dean. The eulogy was given by his close friend and fellow Maastricht rebel Richard Shepherd, at his memorial service at St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Westminster another close friend Charles Moore gave a eulogy.

==Quotations==

On the Downing Street Declaration which said that Britain has &quot;no selfish, strategic or economic interest&quot; in maintaining the Union with Northern Ireland, Budgen asked John Major the question -
&quot;Can I reassure my constituents that the United Kingdom has an interest in maintaining Wolverhampton in the Union?&quot;

On supporting Douglas Hurd in the 1990 Conservative leadership contest: 
&quot;it is the Conservative worker&#x27;s fate to be betrayed by his leader, so we may at least be betrayed elegantly.&quot;

&quot;New Labour will not nationalise industry, it will instead nationalise people.&quot;

&quot;If the Conservatives say beggars should be kicked once, then New Labour will say that beggars should be kicked twice.&quot;

&quot;It would be my general feeling that the transference of power to Europe was so important a matter as to require a vote against any organisation and any party that wished to transfer that power.&quot;

On John Major: &quot;he would make a reasonably competent head of a Wolverhampton Social Security office.&quot;

&quot;If it [Labour] comes to power, those solid citizens will put pressure on the fresh-faced public school boy (Tony Blair) and we shall be back to the old story of an enormous public sector borrowing requirement, higher taxes and higher interest rates, and there will be no difference whatsoever in substance between the fresh-faced public school boy and all the old chaps who are in favour of old Labour.&quot;

Former Labour MP Ken Livingstone once &quot;said admiringly&quot; to Nick Budgen in 1996: &quot;you&#x27;ve made Major change his policy on Europe, again and again.&quot;.

<doc id="261840" wikidata="Q2298322" url="?curid=261840" title="Weald">
<text>The Weald () is an area of South East England between the parallel chalk escarpments of the North and the South Downs. It crosses the counties of Hampshire, Surrey, West Sussex, East Sussex, and Kent. It has three parts, the sandstone &quot;High Weald&quot; in the centre, the clay &quot;Low Weald&quot; periphery and the Greensand Ridge, which stretches around the north and west of the Weald and includes its highest points. The Weald once was covered with forest and its name, Old English in origin, signifies &quot;woodland&quot;. The term is still used, as scattered farms and villages sometimes refer to the Weald in their names.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Weald&quot; is derived from the Old English &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;forest&quot; (cognate of German &quot;Wald&quot;, but unrelated to English &quot;wood&quot;). This comes from a Germanic root of the same meaning, and ultimately from Indo-European. &quot;Weald&quot; is specifically a West Saxon form; &quot;wold&quot; is the Anglian form of the word. The Middle English form of the word is &quot;wēld&quot;, and the modern spelling is a reintroduction of the Old English form attributed to its use by William Lambarde in his &quot;A Perambulation of Kent&quot; of 1576.

In early medieval Britain, the area had the name &quot;Andredes weald&quot;, meaning &quot;the forest of Andred&quot;, the latter derived from &quot;Anderida&quot;, the Roman name of present-day Pevensey. The area is also referred to in early English texts as &quot;Andredesleage&quot;, where the second element, &quot;leage,&quot; is another Old English word for &quot;woodland&quot;, represented by the modern &quot;&quot;.
The adjective for &quot;Weald&quot; is &quot;wealden&quot;.

== Geology ==

The Weald is the eroded remains of a geological structure, an anticline, a dome of layered Lower Cretaceous rocks cut through by weathering to expose the layers as sandstone ridges and clay valleys. The oldest rocks exposed at the centre of the anticline are correlated with the Purbeck Beds of the Upper Jurassic. Above these, the Cretaceous rocks, include the Wealden Group of alternating sands and claysthe Ashdown Sand Formation, Wadhurst Clay Formation, Tunbridge Wells Sand Formation (collectively known as the Hastings Beds) and the Weald Clay. The Wealden Group is overlain by the Lower Greensand and the Gault Formation, consisting of the Gault and the Upper Greensand.

The rocks of the central part of the anticline include hard sandstones, and these form hills now called the &quot;High Weald&quot;. The peripheral areas are mostly of softer sandstones and clays and form a gentler rolling landscape, the &quot;Low Weald&quot;. The Weald–Artois Anticline continues some further south-eastwards under the Straits of Dover, and includes the Boulonnais of France.

Many important fossils have been found in the sandstones and clays of the Weald, including, for example, &quot;Baryonyx&quot;. The famous scientific hoax of Piltdown Man was claimed to have come from a gravel pit at Piltdown near Uckfield. The first &quot;Iguanodon&quot; was identified after the fossil collector and illustrator Mary Ann Mantell supposedly unearthed some fossilised teeth by a road in Sussex in 1822. Her husband, the geologist Gideon Mantell sent them to various experts and this important find led to the discovery of dinosaurs.
The area contains significant reserves of shale oil, totalling 4.4 billion barrels of oil in the Wealden basin according to a 2014 study, which then Business and Energy Minister Michael Fallon said &quot;will bring jobs and business opportunities&quot; and significantly help with UK energy self-sufficiency. Fracking in the area would be required to achieve these objectives, which has been opposed by environmental groups.

== History ==

Prehistoric evidence suggests that, following the Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, the Neolithic inhabitants had turned to farming, with the resultant clearance of the forest. With the Iron Age came the first use of the Weald as an industrial area. Wealden sandstones contain ironstone, and with the additional presence of large amounts of timber for making charcoal for fuel, the area was the centre of the Wealden iron industry from then, through the Roman times, until the last forge was closed in 1813. The index to the Ordnance Survey Map of Roman Britain lists 33 iron mines, and 67% of these are in the Weald.

The entire Weald was originally heavily forested. According to the 9th-century &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, the Weald measured or longer by in the Saxon era, stretching from Lympne, near Romney Marsh in Kent, to the Forest of Bere or even the New Forest in Hampshire. The area was sparsely inhabited and inhospitable, being used mainly as a resource by people living on its fringes, much as in other places in Britain such as Dartmoor, the Fens and the Forest of Arden. The Weald was used for centuries, possibly since the Iron Age, for transhumance of animals along droveways in the summer months. Over the centuries, deforestation for the shipbuilding, charcoal, forest glass, and brickmaking industries has left the Low Weald with only remnants of that woodland cover.

While most of the Weald was used for transhumance by communities at the edge of the Weald, several parts of the forest on the higher ridges in the interior seem to have been used for hunting by the kings of Sussex. The pattern of droveways which occurs across the rest of the Weald is absent from these areas. These areas include St Leonard&#x27;s Forest, Worth Forest, Ashdown Forest and Dallington Forest.

The forests of the Weald were often used as a place of refuge and sanctuary. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; relates events during the Anglo-Saxon conquest of Sussex when the native Britons (whom the Anglo-Saxons called &quot;Welsh&quot;) were driven from the coastal towns into the recesses of the forest for sanctuary,:

Until the Late Middle Ages the forest was a notorious hiding place for criminals.

Settlements on the Weald are widely scattered. Villages evolved from small settlements in the woods, typically apart; close enough to be an easy walk but not so close as to encourage unnecessary intrusion. Few of the settlements are mentioned in the Domesday Book; however Goudhurst&#x27;s church dates from the early 12th century or before and Wadhurst was big enough by the mid-13th century to be granted a royal charter permitting a market to be held. Before then, the Weald was used as summer grazing land, particularly for pannage by inhabitants of the surrounding areas. Many places within the Weald have retained names from this time, linking them to the original communities by the addition of the suffix &quot;-den&quot;: for example, Tenterden was the area used by the people of Thanet. Permanent settlements in much of the Weald developed much later than in other parts of lowland Britain, although there were as many as one hundred furnaces and forges operating by the later 16th century, employing large numbers of people.

In 1216 during the First Barons&#x27; War, a guerilla force of archers from the Weald, led by William of Cassingham (nicknamed Willikin of the Weald), ambushed the French occupying army led by Prince Louis near Lewes and drove them to the coast at Winchelsea. The timely arrival of a French fleet allowed the French forces to narrowly escape starvation. William was later granted a pension from the crown and made warden of the Weald in reward for his services.

The inhabitants of the Weald remained largely independent and hostile to outsiders during the next decades. In 1264 during the Second Barons&#x27; War, the royalist army of King Henry III of England marched through the Weald in order to force the submission of the Cinque Ports. Even though they were not aligned with the rebellious barons, the Weald&#x27;s natives – mostly operating as archers – opposed the royalist advance, using guerrilla warfare. Even though they were unable to stop the army, their attacks inflicted substantial losses on the royalists. In retribution, King Henry ordered the execution of any Weald archers who were captured alive, for instance beheading 300 after a local shot his cook. The king also fined the Battle Abbey for the disloyalty of its tenants.

In the first edition of &quot;On The Origin of Species&quot;, Charles Darwin used an estimate for the erosion of the chalk, sandstone and clay strata of the Weald in his theory of natural selection. Charles Darwin was a follower of Lyell&#x27;s theory of uniformitarianism and decided to expand upon Lyell&#x27;s theory with a quantitative estimate to determine if there was enough time in the history of the Earth to uphold his principles of evolution. He assumed the rate of erosion was around one inch per century and calculated the age of the Weald at around 300 million years. Were that true, he reasoned, the Earth itself must be much older. In 1862, William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) published a paper &quot;On the age of the sun&#x27;s heat&quot;, in which – unaware of the process of solar fusion – he calculated the Sun had been burning for less than a million years, and put the outside limit of the age of the Earth at 200 million years. Based on these estimates he denounced Darwin&#x27;s geological estimates as imprecise. Darwin saw Lord Kelvin&#x27;s calculation as one of the most serious criticisms to his theory and removed his calculations on the Weald from the third edition of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;.

Modern chronostratigraphy shows that the Weald Clays were laid down around 130 million years ago in the Early Cretaceous.

== Geography ==

The Weald begins north-east of Petersfield in Hampshire and extends across Surrey and Kent in the north, and Sussex in the south. The western parts in Hampshire and West Sussex, known as the Western Weald, are included in the South Downs National Park. Other protected parts of the Weald are included in the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. In extent it covers about from west to east, and about from north to south, covering an area of some . The eastern end of the High Weald, the English Channel coast, is marked in the centre by the high sandstone cliffs from Hastings to Pett Level; and by former sea cliffs now fronted by the Pevensey and Romney Marshes on either side.

Much of the &quot;High Weald&quot;, the central part, is designated as the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Its landscape is described as one of

Ashdown Forest, an extensive area of heathland and woodland occupying the highest sandy ridge-top at the centre of the High Weald, is a former royal deer-hunting forest created by the Normans and said to be the largest remaining part of &quot;Andredesweald&quot;.

There are centres of settlement, the largest of which are Horsham, Burgess Hill, East Grinstead, Haywards Heath, Tonbridge, Tunbridge Wells, Crowborough; and the area along the coast from Hastings and Bexhill-on-Sea to Rye and Hythe.

The geological map shows the High Weald in lime green (9a).

The &quot;Low Weald&quot;, the periphery of the Weald, is shown as darker green on the map (9), and has an entirely different character. It is in effect the eroded outer edges of the High Weald, revealing a mixture of sandstone outcrops within the underlying clay. As a result, the landscape is of wide and low-lying clay vales with small woodlands (&quot;shaws&quot;) and fields. There is a great deal of surface water: ponds and many meandering streams.

Some areas, such as the flat plain around Crawley, have been utilised for urban use: here are Gatwick Airport and its related developments and the Horley-Crawley commuter settlements. Otherwise the Low Weald retains its historic settlement pattern, where the villages and small towns occupy harder outcrops of rocks. There are no large towns on the Low Weald, although Ashford, Sevenoaks and Reigate lie immediately on the northern edge. Settlements tend to be small and linear, because of its original wooded nature and heavy clay soils.

The Weald is drained by the many streams radiating from it, the majority being tributaries of the surrounding major rivers: particularly the Mole, Medway, Stour, Rother, Cuckmere, Ouse, Adur and Arun. Many of these streams provided the power for the watermills, blast furnaces and hammers of the iron industry and the cloth mills.

== Transport infrastructure ==
The M25, M26 and M20 motorways all use the Vale of Holmesdale to the north, and therefore run along or near the northern edge of the Weald. The M23/A23 road to Brighton, uses the western, narrower, part of the Weald where there are stream headwaters, crossing it from north to south. Other roads take similar routes, although they often have long hills and many bends: the more sedate, but busy A21 trunk road to Hastings is still beset with traffic delays, despite having had some new sections.

Five railways once crossed the Weald, now reduced to three. Building them provided the engineers with difficulties in crossing the terrain, with the hard sandstone adding to their problems. The Brighton Main Line followed the same route as its road predecessors: although it necessitated the long tunnel near Balcombe and the Ouse Valley Viaduct. Tributaries of the River Ouse provided some assistance in the building of now-closed East Grinstead-Lewes and the Uckfield-Lewes lines. The principal main-line railway to Hastings had to negotiate difficult terrain when it was first built, necessitating many sharp curves and tunnels; and similar problems had to be faced with the Ashford-Hastings line.

Several long-distance footpaths criss-cross the Weald, and it is well-mapped recreationally, covered by routes from:
* The Ramblers&#x27; Associations and most District Councils for walkers
* Sustrans and local county councils for cyclists

== Farming ==

Neither the thin infertile sands of the High Weald or the wet sticky clays of the Low Weald are suited to intensive arable farming and the topography of the area often increases the difficulties. There are limited areas of fertile greensand which can be used for intensive vegetable growing, as in the valley of the Western Rother. Historically the area of cereals grown has varied greatly with changes in prices, increasing during the Napoleonic Wars and during and since World War II.

About 60% of the High Weald farmed land is grassland, with about 20% being arable.

The Weald has its own breed of cattle, called the Sussex, although the breed has been as numerous in Kent and parts of Surrey. Bred from the strong hardy oxen, which continued to be used to plough the clay soils of the Low Weald longer than in most places, these red beef cattle were highly praised by Arthur Young in his book &quot;Agriculture of Sussex&quot; when visiting Sussex in the 1790s. William Cobbett commented on finding some of the finest cattle on some of the region&#x27;s poorest subsistence farms on the High Weald. Pigs, which were kept by most households in the past, were able to be fattened in autumn on acorns in the extensive oak woods. In his novel &quot;Memoirs of a Fox-hunting Man&quot;, the poet and novelist Siegfried Sassoon refers to &quot;the agricultural serenity of the Weald widespread in the delicate hazy sunshine&quot;.

Viticulture has expanded quite rapidly across the Weald, where the climate and soil is well suited to the growing of grapes, with over 20 vineyards now in the Wealden district alone 

== Wildlife ==
The Weald has largely maintained its wooded character, with woodland still covering 23% of the overall area (one of the highest levels in England) and the proportion is considerably higher in some central parts. The sandstones of the Wealden rocks are usually acidic, often leading to the development of acidic habitats such as heathland, the largest remaining areas of which are in Ashdown Forest and near Thursley.

Although common in France, the wild boar became extinct in Great Britain by the 17th century, but wild breeding populations have recently returned in the Weald, following escapes from boar farms.

== Culture ==
The Weald has been associated with many writers, particularly in the 19th and early 20th centuries. These include Vita Sackville-West (1892–1962), Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) and Rudyard Kipling (1865–1936). The setting for A.A. Milne&#x27;s &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; stories was inspired by Ashdown Forest, near Milne&#x27;s country home at Hartfield. John Evelyn (1620–1706), whose family estate was Wotton House on the River Tillingbourne near Dorking, Surrey, was an essayist, diarist, and early author of botany, gardening and geography. The second half of E. M. Forster&#x27;s &quot;A Room with a View&quot; takes place at the protagonist&#x27;s family home, &quot;Windy Corner&quot;, in the Weald.

Sir Winston Churchill, British statesman and a prolific writer himself, did much of his writing at his country house, Chartwell, near Westerham, which has extensive views over the Weald. The view from the house was of crucial importance to Churchill; he once remarked, &quot;I bought Chartwell for that view.&quot;

In the early 21st century, Tunbridge Wells Borough Council promoted &quot;Seven Wonders of the Weald&quot;:
* Bayham Old Abbey
* Bedgebury Pinetum
* Bewl Water
* Finchcocks
* Lamberhurst Vineyard
* Marle Place
* Scotney Castle

== Sport ==

The game of cricket may have originated prior to the 13th century in the Weald . The related game of stoolball is still popular in the Weald, it was originally played mainly by women&#x27;s teams, but since the formation of the Sussex league at the beginning of the 20th century it has been played by both men and women.

== Other English wealds and wolds ==
Several other areas in southern England have the name &quot;Weald&quot;, including North Weald in Essex, and Harrow Weald in north-west London.

&quot;Wold&quot; is used as the name for various open rolling upland areas in the North of England, including the Yorkshire Wolds and the Lincolnshire Wolds, although these are, by contrast, chalk uplands.

The Cotswolds are a major geographical feature of central England, forming a south-west to north-east line across the country.

<doc id="261845" wikidata="Q5081574" url="?curid=261845" title="Charles Pelham Villiers">
<text>Charles Pelham Villiers (3 January 1802 – 16 January 1898) was a British lawyer and politician from the aristocratic Villiers family. He sat in the House of Commons for 63 years, from 1835 to 1898, making him the longest-serving Member of Parliament (MP). He also holds the distinction of the oldest candidate to win a parliamentary seat, at 93. He was a radical and reformer who often collaborated with John Bright and had a noteworthy effect in the leadership of the Anti-Corn Law League, until its repeal in 1846. Lord Palmerston appointed him to the cabinet as president of the Poor-Law Board in 1859. His Public Works (Manufacturing Districts) Act of 1863 opened job-creating schemes in public health projects. He progressed numerous other reforms, most notably the Metropolitan Poor Act of 1867. Florence Nightingale helped him formulate the reform, in particular, ensure professionalisation of nursing as part of the poor law regime, the workhouses of which erected public infirmaries under an Act of the same year. His political importance was overshadowed by his brother, the Earl of Clarendon, and undercut by the hostility of Gladstone.

==Background and education==
Villiers was the son of the Hon. George Villiers and the Hon. Theresa, daughter of John Parker, 1st Baron Boringdon. He was the grandson of Thomas Villiers, 1st Earl of Clarendon and brother of George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon. He was educated at East India Company College and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, becoming a barrister at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1827. He was raised to the rank of an Earl&#x27;s son in 1839 and thus entitled to be styled the Honourable Charles Pelham Villiers.

==Political career==
Villiers held Benthamite political views and enjoyed a long career in public service and Parliament. In 1832, he was a Poor Law Commissioner, and from 1833 to 1852 was an examiner of witnesses in the Court of Chancery.

Villiers was elected as a Liberal Member of Parliament for Wolverhampton in 1835. In each year from 1837 to 1845, he launched parliamentary debates in attempts to repeal the Corn Laws. In 1838, he spoke to over 5,000 &quot;working-class men&quot; in Manchester and told them that the presence of so large an audience gave him the proof that &quot;the working class man was with him&quot;. Villiers was unsuccessful in his attempts, but in 1840 sat on the Committee on Import Duties that provided much of the evidence that pressured Robert Peel into his sliding scale concession in 1842. The bluebook produced by the Committee on Import Duties was published in pamphlet form and distributed across the country by the Anti-Corn Law League, it was reprinted in America and quoted by all leading newspapers of the day, the Spectator published it in abridged form. In February 1842, Villiers was called by Monckton Milnes MP, the &quot;solitary Robinson Crusoe standing on the barren rock of Corn Law repeal&quot;. In 1842, the majority in favour of retaining the Corn Laws had been 303, at the vote on Villiers motion in June 1845 it was down to 132. After the repeal in 1846, the press said of Villiers that he was &quot;the most persevering and undaunted supporter of those principles within the house&quot;. David Ricardo, Chairman of the Free Traders in London, wished to raise money to give to Villiers in recognition of his work, but Villiers declined.

Villiers was a corresponding member of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, and he attended the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London in 1840.

In 1847, Villiers was returned for Lancashire South but elected to sit for his former constituency; his election in Lancashire South was unsolicited but an honour conferred by the people there to express their gratitude for his good work with the repeal of the Corn Laws. Villiers was sworn of the Privy Council in 1853 and served under Lord Aberdeen and Lord Palmerston as Judge Advocate General from 1852 to 1858. In 1853 the Times observed that &quot;it was Mr. Charles Villiers who practically originated the Free Trade movement&quot;. He served under Palmerston and Lord Russell as President of the Poor Law Board (with a seat in the cabinet) from 1859 to 1866. In 1876, he wrote to the Manchester-based &quot;Women&#x27;s Suffrage Journal&quot; in which he stated, in the words of the &quot;Journal&quot;, that &quot;he had voted for the measure [suffrage] on more than one occasion, and should do so again. As far as he was acquainted with the objections usually alleged, he was bound to say they only appear to be those which have always been offered whenever any fresh extension of liberty to the subject has been proposed, and which he had himself heard urged against personal freedom in the colonies, religious liberty in this country, the enfranchisement of the working classes, and against the abolition of every monopoly, political and commercial, wherever it has been assailed&quot;.

Villiers was offered a peerage in June 1885, but declined. His Wolverhampton constituency was divided under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 and he was then elected for Wolverhampton South, switching to the Liberal Unionist party in 1886. He was the Father of the House of Commons from 1890 until his death in 1898. However, the last time he attended Parliament was in 1895. During his time in Parliament he worked towards free trade and opposed the Corn Laws and home rule for Ireland. He is noted as being the voice in parliament of the free trade movement before the election of Richard Cobden and John Bright.

==Personal life==
Villiers died unmarried in January 1898, aged 96. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. A statue of him stands in West Park in Wolverhampton.

<text>John William Davis (April 13, 1873 – March 24, 1955) was an American politician, diplomat and lawyer. He served under President Woodrow Wilson as the Solicitor General of the United States and the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom. He was the Democratic nominee for president in 1924, losing to Republican incumbent Calvin Coolidge.

Davis was born and raised in West Virginia, where his father, John James Davis, had been a delegate to the Wheeling Convention and served in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1870s. Davis joined his father&#x27;s legal practice and adopted many of his father&#x27;s political views, including opposition to anti-lynching legislation and support for states&#x27; rights. Davis served in the U.S. House from 1911 to 1913, helping to write the Clayton Antitrust Act. He held the position of solicitor general in the Justice Department from 1913 to 1918, during which time he successfully argued for the unconstitutionality of the grandfather clause in Oklahoma&#x27;s constitution, which had a discriminatory effect against African-American voters, in &quot;Guinn v. United States&quot;.

While serving as ambassador to Britain from 1918 to 1921, Davis was a dark horse candidate for the 1920 Democratic presidential nomination. After he left office, Davis helped establish the Council on Foreign Relations and advocated for the repeal of Prohibition. The 1924 Democratic National Convention nominated Davis for president after 103 ballots. He remains the only major party presidential nominee from West Virginia. Running on a ticket with Charles W. Bryan, Davis lost in a landslide to incumbent President Coolidge. Davis did not seek public office again after 1924. He continued as a prominent attorney, associated with several law firms over the years, and represented many of the largest companies in the United States from the 1920s onwards. Davis argued 140 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.

In addition to his legal work, Davis was also involved in the New York City Bar Association, serving as its president from 1931 to 1933. In 1933, he represented J. P. Morgan Jr. and his companies during a Senate investigation into private banking and the causes of the Great Depression. During the last two decades of his career, Davis represented large corporations before the Supreme Court, challenging the constitutionality and application of New Deal legislation. He lost many of these cases but scored a major victory in &quot;Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer&quot; (1952), in which the Supreme Court ruled against President Harry Truman&#x27;s seizure of the nation&#x27;s steel plants. Davis unsuccessfully defended the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine in &quot;Briggs v. Elliott&quot; (1952), one of the companion cases to &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954), in which the Court ruled that segregated public schools were unconstitutional.

==Family and early life==

===Family background===
Davis&#x27;s paternal family had roots in western Virginia and what became West Virginia. His great-grandfather, Caleb Davis, was a clockmaker in the Shenandoah Valley. In 1816, his grandfather, John Davis, moved to Clarksburg in what would later become West Virginia. Its population then was 600–700, and he ran a saddle and harness business. His father, John James Davis, attended Lexington Law School, which later became the Washington and Lee University School of Law. By the age of twenty, John J. had established a law practice in Clarksburg. He was a delegate in the Virginia General Assembly, and after the northwestern portion of Virginia broke away from the rest of Virginia in 1863 and formed West Virginia, he was elected to the new state&#x27;s House of Delegates and later to the United States House of Representatives.

John W. Davis&#x27;s mother Anna Kennedy (1841–1917) was from Baltimore, Maryland, daughter of William Wilson Kennedy and his wife Catherine Esdale Martin. Kennedy was a lumber merchant. Catherine was the daughter of Tobias Martin, dairy farmer and amateur poet, and his wife, a member of the Esdale family. The Esdales were members of the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, who had settled near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. Reportedly they helped provide support for the Continental Army under George Washington, which had camped there in the winter of 1777–1778.

===Early years===
Davis&#x27;s Sunday school teacher recalled that he had &quot;a noble face even when small&quot;. His biographer said that &quot;[h]e used better English, kept himself cleaner, and was more dignified than most youngsters. He was also extraordinarily well-mannered.&quot;

===Education===
Davis&#x27;s education began at home, as his mother taught him to read before he had memorized the alphabet. She had him read poetry and other literature from their home library. After turning ten, Davis was put in a class with older students to prepare him for the state teachers examination. A few years later, he was enrolled in a previously all-female seminary that doubled as a private boarding and day school. He never had grades under 94. Davis entered Washington and Lee University at the age of sixteen. He graduated in 1892 with a major in Latin. He joined the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, participated in intramural sports, and attended mixed parties.

Davis would have started law school directly after graduation, but he lacked funds. Instead, he became a teacher for Major Edward H. McDonald of Charles Town, West Virginia. Davis taught McDonald&#x27;s nine children and his six nieces and nephews. His student Julia, nineteen at the time, later became Davis&#x27;s wife. Davis fulfilled a nine-month contract with McDonald. He returned to Clarksburg and apprenticed at his father&#x27;s law practice. For fourteen months he copied documents by hand, read cases, and did much of what other aspiring lawyers did at the time to &quot;read the law&quot;.

Davis graduated with a law degree from Washington and Lee University School of Law in 1895 and was elected Law Class Orator. His speech gave a glimpse of his advocacy skills:
[The] lawyer has been always the sentinel of the watchtower of liberty. In all times and all countries has he stood forth in defense of his nation, her laws and liberties, not, it may be, under a shower of leaden death, but often with the frown of a revengeful and angry tyrant bent upon him.

Fellow classmates of 1895, shall we ... prove unworthy?

===Early legal career===
After graduation, Davis obtained the three signatures required to receive his law license (one from a local judge, and two from local attorneys, who attested to his proficiency in the law and upstanding moral character) and joined his father in practice in Clarksburg. They called their partnership Davis and Davis, Attorneys at Law. Davis lost his first three cases before his fortunes began to turn.

Before Davis had completed his first year of private practice, he was recruited to Washington &amp; Lee Law School as an assistant professor, starting in the fall of 1896. At the time, the law school had a faculty of two, and Davis became the third. At the end of the year, Davis was asked to return but demurred. He decided that he needed the &quot;rough &amp; tumble&quot; of private practice.

===Family connections===

On June 20, 1899, he married Julia T. McDonald, who died on August 17, 1900. They had one daughter together, Julia McDonald Davis. She later married Charles P. Healy, and then William M. Adams. The widower Davis married again, on January 2, 1912, to Ellen G. Bassel. She died in 1943.

Davis was the cousin and adoptive father of Cyrus Vance, who later served as Secretary of State under Jimmy Carter. Vance, born in Clarksburg in 1917, lost his father in 1922 and was sent by his widowed mother to study in Switzerland. The much older and by then quite prominent Davis, referred to as an &quot;uncle&quot; within the family, mentored young Vance and adopted him.

Davis&#x27;s daughter Julia was one of the first two female journalists hired by the Associated Press in 1926. (The other was probably Marguerite Young.) Julia married first Charles P. Healy and later William McMillan Adams, president of Sprague International, the export subsidiary of Sprague Electric. He was the son of Arthur Henry Adams, president of the United States Rubber Company. Both father and son were aboard the luxury liner &quot;RMS Lusitania&quot; when it was sunk by a German submarine in 1915. Arthur Adams died; his son survived.

Julia and William divorced, and both remarried. She divorced again, and later they remarried in their old age. Adams had two sons by his second wife, John Perry and Arthur Henry Adams II. Julia died in 1993 with no natural children but claimed six &quot;by theft and circumstance.&quot;

==Political and diplomatic career==
===Early career===
Davis&#x27;s father had been a delegate to the Wheeling Convention, which had created the state of West Virginia, but he had also opposed the abolitionists and Radical Republicans, and opposed ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment. Davis acquired much of his father&#x27;s southern Democratic politics, opposing women&#x27;s suffrage, Federal child-labor laws and anti-lynching legislation, and Harry S. Truman&#x27;s civil rights program. He defended states&#x27; rights to establish the poll tax by questioning whether uneducated non-taxpayers should be allowed to vote. Davis was as much opposed to centralism in politics as he was to the concentration of capital by large corporations, supporting a number of early progressive laws regulating interstate commerce and limiting the power of corporations. Consequently, he felt distinctly out of place in the Republican Party, which supported free association and free markets, and maintained his father&#x27;s staunch allegiance to the Democratic Party, even as he later represented the interests of business opposed to the New Deal. Davis ranked as one of the last Jeffersonians, as he supported states&#x27; rights and opposed a strong executive (he would be the lead attorney against Truman&#x27;s nationalization of the steel industry).

In 1898, Davis was elected to the West Virginia House of Delegates, ending a 20-year Republican hold on the seat. Even though Davis had argued in behalf of some railroad companies during his legal career, he was elected by denouncing them, as his opponent had made enemies by supporting railroad interests. He was touted for speaker, but ended up becoming the Democratic floor leader. He became well known in the legislature, as few, if any, in the body could match his legal abilities.

After his one term in the legislature, Davis became the Harrison County party chairman for 12 years. He was also a delegate to the 1904 Democratic National Convention and voted for the more conservative candidate, Alton B. Parker. The populism of William Jennings Bryan never appealed to him, and he was pleased to see the Democrats moving in Parker&#x27;s direction.

He represented West Virginia in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1911 to 1913, where he was one of the authors of the Clayton Antitrust Act. Davis also served as one of the impeachment managers in the successful impeachment trial of Judge Robert W. Archbald. He served as U.S. Solicitor General from 1913 to 1918. As Solicitor General, he successfully argued in &quot;Guinn v. United States&quot; for the unconstitutionality of the grandfather clause in Oklahoma&#x27;s constitution. It exempted residents descended from a voter registered in 1866 (i.e. whites) from a literacy test that effectively disenfranchised blacks. Davis&#x27;s personal posture differed from his position as an advocate. Throughout his career, he could separate his personal views and professional advocacy.

Davis served as President Wilson&#x27;s ambassador to Great Britain from 1918 to 1921. He reflected deep Southern support for Wilsonianism, based on a reborn Southern patriotism, a distrust of the Republican Party, and a resurgence of Anglophilism. Davis proselytized in London for the League of Nations based on his paternalistic belief that peace depended primarily on Anglo-American friendship and leadership. He was disappointed by Wilson&#x27;s mismanagement of the treaty ratification and by Republican isolationism and distrust of the League. In his diaries Davis kept records of various developments in British politics at that time, such as social reform proposals and enactments such as unemployment insurance, profit-sharing, a minimum wage law, and an eight-hour law. Davis&#x27;s diary also noted how prime minister David Lloyd George stated “that not only was his programme liberal but so liberal that his programme shocked an American Democrat.”

Davis was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1924.

===Presidential candidate===

Davis was a dark horse candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in both 1920 and 1924. His friend and partner Frank Polk managed his campaign at the 1924 Democratic National Convention. He won the nomination in 1924 as a compromise candidate on the 103rd ballot, after intense infighting between supporters of candidates former Secretary of Treasury William Gibbs McAdoo and New York Governor Al Smith, Davis was selected to appease both sides. Although Tennessee&#x27;s Andrew Johnson served as president after Lincoln was assassinated, Davis&#x27;s nomination made him the first presidential candidate from a former slave state since the Civil War, and as of 2024 he remains the only ever nominee from West Virginia. Davis&#x27;s denunciation of the Ku Klux Klan and prior defense of black voting rights as solicitor general cost him votes in the South and among conservative Democrats elsewhere. Davis&#x27;s staid personality ill-suited him for the demands of campaigning in an age of machine politics, as shown by Claude G. Bowers&#x27; description of a meeting arranged for Davis with a delegation of Irish Catholics from New York:Davis went down the line shaking hands cordially but with the dignity with which he would have passed down the line at a diplomatic reception. It was a fine cordiality, but not the kind these men understood. He should have punched them playfully in the chest or slapped them vigorously on the shoulder. Then he turned and looked at the visitors, apparently a little shy and uncertain what was expected of him.

Finally the vice-chairman spoke. &quot;These men are here to help elect you,&quot; he said, almost accusingly.

Davis smiled and said, &quot;Strength to their arms. We want every man in the boat and every man with an oar.&quot;

There was another embarrassing pause, and the vice-chairman surprised me with an impatient outburst. &quot;Tell them you are an organization man!&quot; he roared.

Davis admitted he was an organization man, looking a bit annoyed by the way he was being put through his paces, and then turned quickly to Mike Hennessy of the Boston Globe and engaged him in conversation. Clearly Davis did not qualify as a backslapping, baby-kissing politician.He lost in a landslide to Calvin Coolidge, who did not leave the White House to campaign. Davis&#x27;s 28.8 percent remains the smallest percentage of the popular vote ever won by a Democratic presidential nominee. Nonetheless, he won every state of the former Confederacy, plus Oklahoma.

===Later political involvement===

Davis was a member of the National Advisory Council of the Crusaders, an influential organization that promoted the repeal of Prohibition. He was the founding president of the Council on Foreign Relations, formed in 1921, chairman of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation from 1922 to 1939. Davis also served as a delegate from New York to the 1928 and 1932 Democratic National Conventions.

In the 1932 presidential election Davis campaigned in behalf of Franklin D. Roosevelt, but never developed a close relationship with him. After Roosevelt took office, Davis quickly turned against the New Deal and joined with Al Smith and other anti-New Deal Democrats in forming the American Liberty League. He supported the Republican presidential candidate in the 1936, 1940, and 1944 elections.

Davis was implicated by retired Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler in the Business Plot, an alleged political conspiracy in 1933 to overthrow Roosevelt, in testimony before the McCormack-Dickstein Committee, whose deliberations began on November 20, 1934, and culminated in the Committee&#x27;s report to the U.S. House of Representatives on February 15, 1935. Davis was not called to testify because &quot;The committee will not take cognizance of names brought into the testimony which constitute mere hearsay.&quot;

In 1949 Davis, as a member of the board of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, testified as a character witness for Alger Hiss (Carnegie&#x27;s president) during his trials (part of the Hiss-Chambers Case): &quot;In the twilight of his career, following the end of World War II, Davis publicly supported Alger Hiss and J. Robert Oppenheimer during the hysteria of the McCarthy hearings&quot; (more accurately, the &quot;McCarthy Era&quot; as the Hiss Case (1948–1950) preceded McCarthyism in the 1950s).

==Legal career==

Davis was one of the most prominent and successful lawyers of the first half of the 20th century, arguing 140 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. His firm, variously titled Stetson Jennings Russell &amp; Davis, then Davis Polk Wardwell Gardiner &amp; Reed, then Davis Polk Wardwell Sunderland &amp; Kiendl (now Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell), represented many of the largest companies in the United States in the 1920s and following decades. From 1931 to 1933, Davis also served as president of the New York City Bar Association.

In 1933, Davis served as legal counsel for the financier J.P. Morgan, Jr. and his companies during the Senate investigation into private banking and the causes of the recent Great Depression.

The last twenty years of Davis&#x27;s practice included representing large corporations before the Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality and application of New Deal legislation. Davis lost many of these battles.

===Appearances before the U.S. Supreme Court===
Of the 140 cases Davis argued before the Supreme Court, 73 were as Solicitor General, and 67 as a private lawyer. Lawrence Wallace, who retired from the Office of the Solicitor General in 2003, argued 157 cases during his career but many believe that few attorneys have argued more cases than Davis. Daniel Webster and Walter Jones are believed to have argued more cases than Davis, but they were lawyers of a much earlier era.

===Youngstown Steel case===
One of Davis&#x27;s most influential arguments before the Supreme Court was in &quot;Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer&quot; in May 1952, when the Court ruled on President Truman&#x27;s seizure of the nation&#x27;s steel plants.

While Davis wasn&#x27;t brought into the case until March 1952, he was already familiar with the concept of a presidential seizure of a steel mill. In 1949, the Republic Steel Company, fearful of advice given to Truman by Attorney General Tom C. Clark, asked Davis for an opinion letter on whether the President could seize private industry in a &quot;National Emergency.&quot; Davis wrote that the President could not do so, unless such power already was vested in the President by law. He further went on to opine on the Selective Service Act of 1948&#x27;s intent, and that seizures were only authorized if a company did not sufficiently prioritize government production in a time of crisis.

Arguing for the steel industry, Davis spoke for 87 minutes before the Court. He described Truman&#x27;s acts as a usurpation&#x27; of power, that were &#x27;without parallel in American history. The justices allowed him to proceed uninterrupted, with only one question from Justice Felix Frankfurter, who may have had a personal feeling against Davis relating to his 1924 presidential campaign. It had been predicted that the President&#x27;s actions would be upheld, and the injunction would be lifted, but the Court decided 6–3 to uphold the injunction stopping the seizure of the steel mills.

&quot;Washington Post&quot; writer Chalmers Roberts subsequently wrote that rarely &quot;has a courtroom sat in such silent admiration for a lawyer at the bar&quot; in reference to Davis&#x27;s oral argument. Unfortunately, Davis did not allow the oral argument to be printed because the stenographic transcript was so garbled he feared it would not be close to what was said at the Court.

Of particular note in this case is that one of the justices in the majority was Tom Clark, who as attorney general in 1949 had advised Truman to proceed with the seizure of Republic Steel. Yet, in 1952, Justice Clark voted with the majority without joining Justice Hugo Black&#x27;s opinion, in direct opposition to his previous advice.

===Brown v. Board of Education===
Davis&#x27;s legal career is most remembered for his final appearance before the Supreme Court, in which he unsuccessfully defended the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine in &quot;Briggs v. Elliott&quot;, a companion case to &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. Davis, as a defender of racial segregation and state control of education, uncharacteristically displayed his emotions in arguing that South Carolina had shown good faith in attempting to eliminate any inequality between black and white schools and should be allowed to continue to do so without judicial intervention. He expected to win, most likely through a divided Supreme Court, even after the matter was re-argued after the death of Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson. After the Supreme Court unanimously ruled against his client&#x27;s position, he returned the $25,000 (equivalent to $ in ), that he had received from South Carolina, although he was not required to do so, but kept a silver tea service that had been presented to him. It has also been reported that he never charged South Carolina in the first place. He declined to participate further in the case, as he did not wish to be involved in the drafting of decrees to implement the Court&#x27;s decision.

==Death and legacy==
Davis was a member of the American Bar Association, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Freemasons, Phi Beta Kappa, and Phi Kappa Psi. He was a resident of Nassau County, New York, and practiced law in New York City until his death in Charleston, South Carolina, at the age of 81. He is interred at Locust Valley Cemetery in Locust Valley, New York.

The John W. Davis Federal Building on West Pike Street in Clarksburg, West Virginia, is named for him. The building housing the Student Health Center at Washington and Lee University is named for him, as is the Law School&#x27;s appellate advocacy program, and an award for the graduating student with the highest grade point average.

In the 1991 television film &quot;Separate But Equal&quot;, a dramatization of the &quot;Brown&quot; case, Davis was portrayed by the famed actor Burt Lancaster in his final film role.

<text>Trent University is a public liberal arts university in Peterborough, Ontario, with a satellite campus in Oshawa, which serves the Regional Municipality of Durham. Founded in 1964, the university is known for its Oxbridge college system, small class sizes, and 11 on-campus nature reserves.

The university&#x27;s main Symons campus, named after founding president Thomas Symons, is located on the banks of the Otonabee River at the northeast corner of the City of Peterborough. The Symons campus plan and its original structures, including Champlain College, Lady Eaton College, Bata Library, the Chemistry Building, and the Faryon bridge, were designed by Canadian architect Ron Thom. 

Although Trent University is a predominantly undergraduate institution, programs are also offered at the graduate and doctorate levels. In 2023, over 13,000 undergraduates and over 1,200 graduate students were enrolled at the Symons campus while Trent University Durham GTA served over 3,000 full- and part-time students at its Oshawa campus. The university is represented in Canadian Interuniversity Sports by the Trent Excalibur varsity team.
== History ==

Trent University resulted from a community discussion in 1957 about the potential for a post-secondary institution in the Trent Valley. The campaign to establish Peterborough&#x27;s first post-secondary institution coincided with the Ontario government&#x27;s plan to create new and expand existing universities, and was furthered influenced by public pressure and the general belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society.

In 1963, Trent University was founded as a non-denominational, public institution in downtown Peterborough, Ontario. It was established as a provincial university under the &quot;Trent University Act, 1962–63&quot;. In the fall of 1964, the university welcomed its first students, with its initial campus consisting of three refurbished buildings in central Peterborough: Rubidge Hall, Catherine Parr Traill College for women, and Peter Robinson College for men. Georges Vanier, the then Governor General of Canada, officially opened Trent University in the following year. That same year, there were around 100 students in attendance.

Modelled on the provincial &quot;University of Toronto Act&quot; of 1906, Trent established a bicameral system consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policies, and a board of governors (citizens), exercising exclusive control over financial policies and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies through institutional leadership.

Canadian General Electric, a major industrial employer in Peterborough, donated a parcel of land along the Otonabee River; other lands were subsequently acquired on both sides of the river to serve as the site of the university&#x27;s permanent campus. The CGE donation included a functioning hydroelectric power plant dating from the 1890s, which still generates a substantial portion of the university&#x27;s electricity and produces income for the university. The power plant underwent a $22.8-million upgrade in 2013; Trent University owns 50% of the power plant with Peterborough Utilities Group owning the remaining 50%.

The university&#x27;s Geography Department was set up in 1968, and in 1969 the university offered Canada&#x27;s first Native Studies program.

In 2017, Trent announced the Trent University Research &amp; Innovation Park (since renamed to Cleantech Commons). That year the university enrolled about 3,500 new students.

== Campuses ==

=== Symons Campus ===
As a collegiate university, the Symons campus in Peterborough is currently made up of five colleges that each have their own residence halls, amenities, academic affiliations, dons, and student government (or Cabinet). The student governments and their respective committees cooperate with the College Office in planning and delivering a variety of events for both non-resident and resident members, such as visiting guest speakers, dinners and dances, the bi-annual College Weekend, and a number of intramural co-educational sport competitions.

==== Catharine Parr Traill College ====
Named after pioneer writer and biologist Catharine Parr Traill, Catherine Part Traill College is the only college situated in downtown Peterborough and is the oldest remaining college. It serves as the base for the undergraduate departments of English, Cultural Studies, Media Studies, Canadian Studies and the Trent-Swansea Dual Degree in Law program. Four graduate programs have offices in the college including Public Texts (English); Cultural Studies; History; as well as the Frost Centre for Canadian Studies and Indigenous Studies. Traill College is also the home of Trent University&#x27;s Continuing Education program.

Traill College consists of several buildings: Wallis Hall offers a mix of academic, residential, and recreational spaces, including The Trend restaurant established in 1967; Scott House, the original location of Catharine Parr Traill College, is home to the College Office, a library, common rooms, lecture spaces, and the Department of Cultural Studies; Crawford House residence; Stewart House; Kerr House; and Fry Lodge (formerly the Principal&#x27;s Lodge), which is named after the college&#x27;s first principal, Marion Fry.

The university previously owned Bradburn and Langton Houses on the adjacent London Street, but both properties were sold to the Peterborough Housing Corporation in 2009. The Langton House property was sold to Hospice Peterborough in 2012, demolished and converted into a residential hospice. In fall 1999, a university task force recommended closing the college as a cost-saving measure, which led to a flurry of protest and a successful campaign to save Traill. In 2008, it was converted to a centre of graduate studies. In 2016, an external presidential review of the college was ordered, which recommended that Traill return to its roots as a more &quot;traditional&quot; college, welcome back undergraduate members, and expand its services and reach into the local community.

==== Champlain College ====
Located along the Otonabee River, Champlain College was opened in 1966. It is named after the early 17th century French explorer Samuel de Champlain, who visited the Otonabee area in 1615. A noted cartographer, diplomat, and soldier, he also founded Quebec City in 1608 and his sword is featured in the Trent crest. The college originally served as an all-male residence, along with Peter Robinson College. It is home to the Political Studies department, the Trent International Office, the university bookstore, and the Trent University Alumni Association.

==== Lady Eaton College ====
Established in 1968 as an all-women&#x27;s college, though now co-ed, Lady Eaton College is named in honour of local resident Flora McCrea Eaton, Lady Eaton. The college contains the offices for the departments of History, Philosophy, Classics, Women&#x27;s Studies, and French and Francophone Studies.

==== Otonabee College ====

Otonabee College was founded in 1972. The college&#x27;s name comes from that of the Otonabee River, which derives from the Anishinaabemowin word &quot;Odenabe&quot; meaning &quot;river that beats like a heart&quot;. Eight &quot;houses&quot; connected by an interior walkway called &quot;the Link&quot; make up Otonabee&#x27;s residence. The residence is co-educational, although there are single-sex areas within the houses. Past &quot;the Link&quot; (a path leading to the instructional area of the college that bisects the residences) are a set of faculty offices and the main dining hall, which looks to the north and east of the grounds. The academic wing is directly connected with the Science Buildings and houses the School of Education, as well as the departments of Psychology, Anthropology, Sociology, Forensic Sciences, Nursing, and Computing &amp; Information Systems. Also located in Otonabee College is the Wenjack Theatre, which provides a venue for multimedia lecture presentations, as well as theatrical productions by amateur and professional companies.

==== Peter Gzowski College ====
Founded in 2003, Peter Gzowski College is the most recently added college, named for CBC broadcaster Peter Gzowski, who was the university&#x27;s eighth chancellor. At one point the college had two locations: on Argyle Street in buildings leased from the current Master&#x27;s College and Seminary, which housed the Teacher Education and Nursing programs; and the Enwayaang building (&quot;Enwayaang&quot; means &quot;the way we speak together&quot; in Anishinaabe), which housed the Indigenous Studies, Economics, Mathematics, and Business Administration programs, as well as the First People&#x27;s House of Learning. Departments at the Argyle location were moved to Enwayaang prior to the 2006–2007 academic year.

==== Gidigaa Migizi College ====
In November 2023, Trent announced that its sixth college would be named Gidigaa Migizi College, after the late Gidigaa Migizi (Doug Williams), a respected member of the Trent community and an Elder and community member of Curve Lake First Nation. Meaning spotted eagle in English, the name Gidigaa Migizi College was recommended by the university&#x27;s Elders &amp; Traditional Knowledge Keepers Council and approved by Trent&#x27;s Board of Governors.

The new college crest, scarf, and colours will be unveiled in 2024. The building will include as many as 700 new beds for first-year students, along with classrooms, faculty offices, and student spaces. The college is slated to open in fall 2028.

=== Trent University Durham GTA Campus ===
Trent&#x27;s Durham GTA campus in Oshawa has been offering courses for over 50 years, initially in classrooms rented from the Eastwood Collegiate and Vocational Institute. Later, Trent took space at Durham College and steadily expanded the range of courses available before acquiring a former elementary school on Thornton Road. The building was renovated and expanded, and was officially inaugurated on 18 October 2010 for the 2010–2011 academic year. Over 3,000 full- and part-time students attend Trent University Durham in various undergraduate- and graduate-level programs, though not all programs from the main campus are offered at the satellite campus. In addition, there are several courses offered at Trent&#x27;s Durham campus that students can take and later major in (and possibly minor in) at the Peterborough campus, including biology, computer information systems, cultural studies, economics, environmental &amp; resource studies, geography, modern languages, philosophy, political studies, and women&#x27;s studies.

=== Former Colleges ===

==== Peter Robinson College ====
Peter Robinson College was the university&#x27;s first college and was dedicated to Peter Robinson, the member of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada who oversaw the migration of Irish settlers to the local area in the 1820s. The college once had an apartment-style residence but it ceased operations when it was sold to a private landlord in 2004. The university administration closed down the college, against the protests of many students and faculty at the time. By referendum in March 2003, Trent students voted to create and operate a non-profit educational and cultural student facility to be shared with the community as a whole. Chosen to house this new facility was Sadleir House; one of the original university buildings at the college&#x27;s site, it holds special historical significance for both the Trent and Peterborough communities. Funded by a new student levy and organized as the P.R. Community and Student Association (PRCSA), the students&#x27; offer to purchase the property was accepted by the current non-university owners. The trust secured a mortgage for the property and the students took possession of Sadleir House on 27 February 2004. Currently, each student pays a levy fee each year to support the operations of the house. Among other things, Sadleir House contains the offices of &quot;Arthur&quot;, the university&#x27;s student newspaper, and the Sadleir House Alternative Library.

==== Julian Blackburn College ====
Until 2011, Julian Blackburn College offered programs for part-time students in Peterborough. It was named after Julian Blackburn, one of the original professors who helped establish the university. The college is now defunct, but the Julian Blackburn Hall is now home to Trent&#x27;s administration, as well as medical, counselling, printing, parking, registrar, financial aid, student affairs, student accounts, and several other university services.

== Graduate studies ==
At the graduate and doctorate levels, Trent has a number of programs, such as Anthropology M.A. (current focus is in physical anthropology and archaeology), Applications of Modelling in the Natural &amp; Social Sciences M.A./M.Sc., Public Texts (English) M.A., History M.A., Cultural Studies M.A. and PhD, Environmental and Life Sciences (formerly known as Watershed Ecosystems) Ph.D. / M.Sc., and Materials Sciences Ph.D./M.Sc. as well as a Psychology M.A./M.Sc. The Frost Centre for Canadian Studies and Indigenous Studies offers an interdisciplinary Canadian Studies and Indigenous Studies M.A. program. In addition, the centre offers, in collaboration with Carleton University, a Canadian Studies Ph.D. program, which was the first of its kind in Canada.

In July 2014, Trent announced they would open a Masters in Educational Studies program in July 2015.
== Indigenous studies ==
For more than 50 years, Trent has incorporated traditional Indigenous teachings and perspectives into its programming. It was the first university in Canada, and the second in North America, to establish an academic department dedicated to the study of Indigenous peoples and Indigenous knowledge. Trent&#x27;s Chanie Wenjack School for Indigenous Studies offers undergraduate, master&#x27;s and Ph.D. programs in Indigenous Studies. Trent University offers a program in Indigenous Environmental Studies in addition to a specialized Diploma in Foundations of Indigenous Learning that provides access for people of Indigenous heritage. The First Peoples House of Learning houses Nozhem, a First Peoples performance space.

==Student life==

=== Clubs ===
Trent has a variety of clubs and associations, including a number of theatre groups, social interest groups, newspapers, religious groups, political chapters and academic societies and Greeks. These groups include the Trent Business Students&#x27; Association, Trent History Undergraduate Society (THUGS), the Peterborough chapter of the Ontario Public Interest Research Group, Anne Shirley Theatre Company, Trent Outdoors, Sustainable Trent, the Centre for Gender and Social Justice (previously known as Trent Women&#x27;s Centre), Trent University Lions Club, Trent Cricket Association, Rotaract Peterborough, and the Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 3908. These groups are showcased during Orientation Week (O Week) for new incoming students. The university is also served by the Trent University Emergency First Response Team (TUEFRT), a student run organization whose members provide emergency first aid to all students, visitors, and staff on campus.

Though Trent University does not recognize fraternities and sororities on their campus, there are a few that operate off campus. There is one fraternity, Tau Kappa Epsilon, and four sororities: Alpha Pi Phi, Delta Phi Nu, Kappa Sigma Psi and Sigma Psi Alpha&quot;.&quot;

=== Media===
&quot;Arthur&quot; is a student and community newspaper associated with but editorially independent from Trent University. It was founded by Stephen Stohn in 1966. The paper has a print run of 1,500 copies per month from August to April during the academic year, and is distributed on the Trent campus and around the Peterborough community free of charge. The newspaper is supported by a non-refundable levy in the students&#x27; tuition fees. &quot;Absynthe Magazine&quot; is another student paper, which was founded in 1999 and is a submissions-based publication that is reliant on Trent&#x27;s community members to provide content. Like &quot;Arthur&quot;, it is distributed free of charge but receives a refundable levy from each full-time student.

Trent Radio operates the community&#x27;s student-sponsored community radio (formerly classified as student radio) broadcast facility called CFFF 92.7fm. Full-time students pay a membership fee as part of their student fees to support Trent Radio activities. The now defunct TrentBook was a website designed by students for students, which had articles and discussions on an array of topics that concerned Trent students. Students could also post and ask questions that they might want to have answered or discussed about.

The final scenes of &quot;Urban Legends: Final Cut&quot; (2000) were filmed at Trent University, as well as most of &quot;The Novice&quot; (2021) 

=== Athletics ===
There are many varsity and intramural sports at the university that compete at the varsity level under the name Excalibur, in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s curling, cross country, rugby union, volleyball, fencing, rowing, competitive swimming, and soccer. Trent University installed a new artificial turf athletics field in the summer of 2005 that was built as part of Trent&#x27;s bid to hold the 2007 U19 Women&#x27;s Lacrosse Championships. There is seating for 1,000 spectators. Each autumn, Trent in conjunction with the Peterborough Rowing Club hosts the Head of the Trent rowing regatta, a head-style race along the Trent Canal and Otonabee River that ends under the Faryon Bridge at the Symons campus. The day-long event is open to university, club, and high school crews. The Head of the Trent weekend, which also serves as a homecoming event, takes place at the university and includes a wide range of athletic and festive events. The Head of The Trent is one of the largest events of its kind in the world, and the largest single-day regatta in North America. A new rowing and paddling tank, named in honour of former head coach Carol Love, was recently opened in the new Trent Community Sports and Recreation Center (formerly the Trent Athletics Complex).

Trent&#x27;s lacrosse team went through the 2008 campaign with a perfect regular season of 10-0, winning the Eastern Championship. However, they fell short in the Bagataway Championships to the CUFLA champions, the Guelph Gryphons. 
In 2002–2003, the women&#x27;s volleyball team obtained varsity status. Competing in the Ontario Colleges Athletics Association, Trent, over the last 10 years has grown into a top team in the east division. In 2009–2010, the Trent Women qualified for its first ever provincial championship held at Cambrian College. The 2010–2011 season saw Trent post a program best 18–2 regular season record, and another appearance at the provincial championships held at Loyalist College. After once again qualifying for the 2011–2012 provincial championships, Trent won the bid to host the 2012–2013 provincial championships, earning an automatic berth. Since then, the Trent women&#x27;s volleyball team has had one athlete inducted into the OCAA Hall of Fame. 
The Trent University taekwondo team won the Canadian University Taekwondo championships for two years in a row. A change in the rules of the competition prevented Trent from winning a third consecutive title opting instead for a second place.

==Academic reputation==

In &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; 2023 university rankings, Trent University ranked fourth in its &quot;primarily undergraduate&quot; category.

<doc id="261860" wikidata="Q468028" url="?curid=261860" title="Jerry Nelson">
<text>Jerry Nelson (July 10, 1934 – August 23, 2012) was an American puppeteer, best known for his work with The Muppets. Known for his wide range of characters and singing abilities, he performed Muppet characters on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;, and various Muppet movies and specials.

==Career==
On &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, Nelson&#x27;s longest-running character was Count von Count, the counting vampire who takes delight in counting anything (and everything) he can. Nelson did the voice and puppetry for the Count from 1972 until 2004 and continued to provide the Count&#x27;s voice until his death in 2012. His other Muppet roles on that program were Herbert Birdsfoot, The Amazing Mumford, Herry Monster, Biff, Mr. Johnson, Simon Soundman, Mr. Chatterly, Frazzle, Little Jerry, and Sherlock Hemlock. He has also made a total of nine onscreen appearances on the show.

From 1971 to 1978, Nelson was the first puppeteer to perform Mr. Snuffleupagus. Reported back problems caused by the physical stress of the character forced him to bow out of the role, but in a 2009 interview Nelson provided a different explanation: &quot;I was not loath to give that character up. But the reasons for giving it up were because at that time we were doing &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; and he was a real part of [&quot;Sesame Street&quot;], and they needed his presence. So they asked if I&#x27;d mind giving it up.&quot;

Nelson also performed many characters on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, including Sgt. Floyd Pepper (the bassist of the Electric Mayhem band), &quot;Pigs in Space&quot; star Dr. Julius Strangepork, the boomerang fish-throwing Lew Zealand, Kermit the Frog&#x27;s nephew Robin the Frog, Gonzo&#x27;s girlfriend Camilla the Chicken, the mad pyrotechnist Crazy Harry, and &quot;the Phantom of the Muppet Show&quot;, Uncle Deadly. He performed Statler in the pilot episode but was replaced by Richard Hunt when he could not perform full-time in the first season. He was a full-time performer for the rest of the show&#x27;s run. Nelson was also selected to play Statler after Hunt&#x27;s death, after the end of the show.

Less prominent characters on the show include sportscaster Louis Kazagger, Pops the doorman, giant blue monster Thog, gossip columnist Fleet Scribbler, and Scooter&#x27;s uncle, J.P. Grosse, who owned the theater. He originated the role of Fozzie Bear&#x27;s mother in season 2 of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; and reprised the role in the TV specials &quot;A Muppet Family Christmas&quot;, &quot;The Muppets at Walt Disney World&quot;, and the film &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot;.

Nelson performed the puppet and voice of Emmet in &quot;Emmet Otter&#x27;s Jug-Band Christmas&quot;, a one-hour special that originally aired on CBC. He later performed the signature song from that show, &quot;When the River Meets the Sea,&quot; as Robin, in a duet with John Denver for a Muppet Christmas special. That version of the song gets frequent radio airplay during the Christmas season (although the song is not seasonal). He and Louise Gold performed the song at Jim Henson’s Memorial Service.

On &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;, he performed Gobo Fraggle, Pa Gorg, and Marjory the Trash Heap. Frank Oz did not perform on &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;, and Jim Henson and Hunt limited their time on the show, so they performed supporting characters. For this reason, Nelson was asked to perform Gobo, the central role on the show.

Nelson&#x27;s characters were often singers or musicians. He performed the lead vocals for many songs as Floyd of the Electric Mayhem, Little Jerry of Little Jerry and the Monotones, Slim Wilson of Lubbock Lou and his Jughuggers, and a number of Anything Muppet bands. Most of his main characters in all three shows sang songs at one time or another.

He reprised the role of the announcer in &quot;The Muppets&quot;. His final performance as the announcer was part of the &quot;Jim Henson&#x27;s Musical World&quot; concert at Carnegie Hall. Archive audio of his announcer role was reused in &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot;, which was dedicated to both Nelson and Jane Henson, wife of Muppets&#x27; creator Jim Henson.

In 2001, Nelson also performed the character voice of General Public in the Cartoon Network animated series &quot;Sheep in the Big City&quot; in the episode &quot;Daddy Shearest&quot;.

In December 2009, Nelson, who summered in Truro, Massachusetts on Cape Cod, released &quot;Truro Daydreams&quot;, an album of original songs.

==Personal life==
Nelson had a daughter named Christine from his first marriage to Jacqueline Nelson Gordon. Christine had cystic fibrosis and died from the disease in 1982, after attending Rye Country Day School. Caring for her limited Nelson&#x27;s involvement in &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;″s first season. She made a speaking cameo appearance with him in the second Muppet movie, &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot;. He then married his second wife Jan Nelson in 1984, and they remained married until his death in 2012.

In 2004, Nelson announced that he would no longer be puppeteering his Muppet characters, citing health reasons. However, he continued to voice his characters on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; until his death on August 23, 2012. Matt Vogel currently performs most of Nelson&#x27;s Muppet characters.

==Illness and death==
Nelson suffered from prostate cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and emphysema. For the last six years of his life, he required an oxygen tank to assist his breathing. He died on August 23, 2012, at his Cape Cod home from complications of his illnesses at the age of 78. Nelson was cremated by Boston&#x27;s Neptune Society in Weymouth, Massachusetts. The film &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot; was dedicated to him and Jane Henson.

<text>Hohhot, formerly known as Kweisui, is the capital of Inner Mongolia in the north of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, serving as the region&#x27;s administrative, economic and cultural center. Its population was 3,446,100 inhabitants as of the 2020 census, of whom 2,944,889 lived in the metropolitan area consisting of 4 urban districts (including Hohhot Economic and Development Zone) plus the Tumed Left Banner.

The name of the city in Mongolian means &quot;Blue City&quot;, although it is also wrongly referred to as the &quot;Green City.&quot; The color blue in Mongol culture is associated with the sky, eternity and purity. In Chinese, the name can be translated as &quot;Qīng Chéng&quot; () The name has also been variously romanized as Kokotan, Kokutan, Kuku-hoton, Huhohaot&#x27;e, Huhehot, Huhhot, Huhot, or Köke qota.

The city is a seat of the Inner Mongolia University, the largest regional comprehensive university and the only 211 Project University in Inner Mongolia.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Yunzhong Commandery () was a historical commandery of China. Its territories were between the Great Wall and Yin Mountains, and correspond to part of modern-day Hohhot, Baotou and Ulanqab prefectures in Inner Mongolia. The central city of Yunzhong was in the suburbs of today&#x27;s Hohhot.

The commandery was created during King Wuling of Zhao&#x27;s reign after a successful campaign against the Linhu (林胡) and Loufan (樓煩) peoples. After the establishment of Qin and Han dynasty, the commandery became the frontier between Han and the Xiongnu. In early Han dynasty, the region saw frequent Xiongnu raids. However, from Emperor Wu&#x27;s reign onwards, it became an important base of military operations in the wars against the Xiongnu. In 127 BC, it was from Yunzhong that General Wei Qing led a 40,000-men strong cavalry force and conquered the modern Hetao and Ordos regions.

In 2 AD, the commandery administered 11 counties, namely Yunzhong (雲中), Xianyang (咸陽), Taolin (陶林), Zhenling (楨陵), Duhe (犢和), Shaling (沙陵), Yuanyang (原陽), Shanan (沙南), Beiyu (北輿), Wuquan (武泉) and Yangshou (陽壽). The population totaled 38,303 households, or 173,270 people. During Eastern Han, 3 counties were abolished, while 3 new counties were added from Dingxiang Commandery. In 140 AD, the population was 5,351 households, or a population of 26,430. Toward the late Han dynasty, the area&#x27;s population decreased sharply as residents fled from invading northern nomadic peoples, and the commandery was dissolved.

The Tuoba chieftain Gui (called Tuoba Gui) was able to refound the Dai empire in 386. From his capital at Shengle (near modern Helingeer). His descendants would, step by step, conquer the north of China, divide the Later Yan realm into two parts, and subdue the Xia (407–431), the Later Qin (384–417) and the many Liang and Yan empires.

=== Ming and Qing era ===
In 1557, the Tümed Mongol leader Altan Khan began building the Da Zhao Temple on the Tümed plain in order to convince the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) government of his leadership of the southern Mongol tribes. The town that grew up around this temple was called the &quot;Blue Town&quot; (&quot;Kokegota&quot; in Mongolian). The Ming had been blockading the Mongols&#x27; access to Chinese iron, cotton, and crop seeds, in order to dissuade them from attacking the North China plain. In 1570, Altan Khan successfully negotiated the end of the blockade by establishing a vassal-tributary relationship with the Ming, who changed Kokegota&#x27;s name to Guihua (; postal: &quot;Kweihua&quot;; ) in 1575. The population of Guihua grew to over 150,000 in the early 1630s as local Mongol princes encouraged the settlement of Han Chinese merchants. There were occasional attacks on Guihua by Mongol armies, such as the total razing of the city by Ligdan Khan in 1631. Altan Khan and his successors constructed temples and fortresses in 1579, 1602 and 1727. The Tümed Mongols of the area had long since adopted a semiagricultural way of life. Hui merchants gathered north of the gate of the city&#x27;s fortress, building a mosque in 1693. Their descendants formed the nucleus of the modern Huimin district.

After the Manchus founded the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), the Kangxi Emperor (reigned 1661–1722) sent troops to control the region, which was of interest to the Qing as a center of study of Tibetan Buddhism. Just 2 km northeast of Guihua the Qing built the strong garrison town of Suiyuan (), from which they supervised the defense of southwestern Inner Mongolia against Mongol attacks from the north in 1735–39. Guihua and Suiyuan was merged into Shanxi province and became Guihua County () of Qing China. French missionaries established a Catholic church in Guihua in 1874, but the Christians were forced to flee to Beijing during the antiforeign Boxer Rebellion of 1899–1901.

=== Republican era ===

In 1913, the government of the new Republic of China united the garrison town of Suiyuan and the old town of Guihua as Guisui (; postal: Kweisui). Guisui town was the center of Guisui County () and the capital of Suiyuan Province in northern China. A bubonic plague outbreak in 1917 and the connection of Guisui to railway links in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hebei, and Beijing helped renew the economy of Guisui town by forming links with eastern China and western China&#x27;s Xinjiang province. In 1918, the American specialist on Inner Asia Owen Lattimore noted Guisui&#x27;s ethnic composition as &quot;a town purely Han Chinese except for the Lama monasteries ... the Tümeds are now practically nonexistent and the nearest Mongolians are to be sought at distance on the plateau.&quot; During the progressive Japanese invasion of China in the 1930s, the Japanese created the puppet state of Mengjiang headed by Prince De, who renamed Guisui &quot;Blue City&quot; &quot;Hohhot&quot;; (). After the surrender of Japan in 1945, the Republic of China changed the name back to Guisui. The Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s forces drove out General Fu Zuoyi, the Republic&#x27;s commander in Suiyuan, during the Chinese Civil War, and after the Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949, Guisui was renamed Hohhot.

=== People&#x27;s Republic era ===

During the Civil War, seeking the support of separatist Mongols, the Communists established the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in Mongol-minority areas of the Republic&#x27;s provinces of Suiyuan, Xing&#x27;an, Chahar, and Rehe. Guisui was chosen as the region&#x27;s administrative centre in 1952, replacing Zhangjiakou. In 1954, after the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the city was renamed from Guisui to Hohhot, though with a different Chinese pronunciation of &quot;Huhehaote&quot;.

The city has seen significant development since China&#x27;s reform and opening began. The city&#x27;s far east side began development around 2000 and is now home to the municipal government, most of the Autonomous Region&#x27;s administrative buildings, an artificial lake called Ruyi He, and a large number of condominiums, mostly built by the local real estate company Gold Horse International Inc. The Hohhot City Stadium, built on the city&#x27;s north side, was finished in 2007.

A city with a rich cultural background, Hohhot is known for its historical sites and temples and is one of the major tourist destinations of Inner Mongolia. It is also nationally known as the home of China&#x27;s dairy giants Mengniu and Yili, and was declared &quot;Dairy Capital of China&quot; by the China Dairy Industry Association and the Dairy Association of China in 2005.

== Geography ==
Located in the south central part of Inner Mongolia, Hohhot is encircled by the Daqing Shan () to the north and the Hetao Plateau to the south.

The city&#x27;s antipodal location is from the village of Los Menucos in Río Negro Provence, Argentina.

=== Climate ===
Hohhot features a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;), marked by long, cold, and very dry winters; hot, somewhat humid summers; strong winds (especially in spring); and monsoonal influence. The coldest month is January, with a daily mean of , while July, the hottest month, averages . The annual mean temperature is , and the annual precipitation is , with more than half of it falling in July and August alone. Variability can be very high, however: in 1965 Hohhot recorded as little as but six years before that, as much as , of which over a third () only in July.

Hohhot is a popular destination for tourists during the summer months because of the nearby Zhaohe grasslands. More recently, due to desertification, the city sees sandstorms on almost an annual basis. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 54 percent in November to 66 percent in September, sunshine is abundant year-round, the city receives 2,680 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 6 February 1951 to on 30 July 2010, though unofficially a record low of was recorded in January 1930.

== Administrative divisions ==
The city is administratively at the prefecture-level, meaning that it administers both its urban area and the rural regions in its vicinity. The administrative area includes 4 counties, 4 districts, and a county-level banner; they are further divided into 20 urban sub-districts, and 96 townships. The data here represented is in km2 and uses data from the 2010 Census.


==Demographics==

The urban population of Hohhot has increased rapidly since the 1990s. According to the 2010 Census, the population of Hohhot had reached 2,866,615 people, 428,717 more inhabitants than in 2000 (&quot;the average annual demographic growth for the period 2000–2010 was of 1.63 percent&quot;). Its built-up (&quot;or metro&quot;) area is home to 1,980,774 inhabitants (&quot;4 urban districts&quot;).

The majority of the population of Hohhot are Han Chinese, representing 87.16 percent of the total population in 2010. Most Han in Hohhot, if their ancestry is traced several decades back, have ancestors from Shanxi, northeast China, or Hebei. Most Mongols in the city speak Chinese. A 1993 survey conducted by Inner Mongolia University found that only 8 percent of Tümed Mongols (the majority tribe in Hohhot) could speak the Mongolian language. A significant portion of the population is of mixed ethnic origin. According to the anthropologist William Jankowiak, author of the book &quot;Sex, Death, and Hierarchy in a Chinese City&quot; (1993), there is &quot;relatively little difference between minority culture and Han culture&quot; in Hohhot, with differences concentrating around relatively minor attributes such as food and art, and similarities abounding over fundamental issues of ethics, status, life goals, and worldview.

Ethnic groups in Hohhot, according to the 2000 census, were:
== Economy ==
Hohhot is a major industrial center within Inner Mongolia. Together with Baotou and Ordos, it accounts for more than 60 percent of the total industrial output of Inner Mongolia. After Baotou and Ordos, it is the third-largest economy of the province, with GDP of RMB 247.56 billion in 2012, up 11.0 percent year on year. Hohhot accounted for approximately 15.5 percent of the province&#x27;s total GDP in 2012. It is also the largest consumer center in the region, recording ¥102.2 billion retail sales of consumer goods in 2012, an increase of 14.9 percent from 2011. The city has been a central developmental target for the China Western Development project being pursued by the Central Government. There are many famous enterprises located in Hohhot, including China&#x27;s largest dairy producer by sales revenue, the Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group, and the China Mengniu Dairy Co.

As the economic center of Inner Mongolia, Hohhot&#x27;s urban area has expanded greatly since the 1990s. CBDs have grown rapidly in all the city&#x27;s major districts. The completion of a new office tower for the Municipal Government in Eastern Hohhot marked a shift of the city center to the east. Hailiang Plaza (), a 41-floor tower constructed in the city center, became one of the few notable department stores for luxury merchandise in the city.

=== Major development zones ===
*Hohhot Economic and Technological Development Zone
*Hohhot Export Processing Zone

== Culture ==

Due to its relatively diverse cultural make-up, and despite its characteristics as a mid-sized Chinese industrial city, the Hohhot street scene has no shortage of ethnic minority elements. Tongdao Road, a major street in the old town area, is decorated with Islamic and Mongol exterior designs on all its buildings. A series of government initiatives in recent years have emphasized Hohhot&#x27;s identity with ethnic minority groups, especially in increasing Mongol-themed architecture around the city. By regulation, all street signs and public transportation announcements are in both Chinese and Mongolian.

=== Dialect ===

Older Hohhot residents mostly tend to converse in the Hohhot dialect, a branch of the Jin language from neighbouring Shanxi province. This spoken form can be difficult to understand for speakers of other Mandarin Chinese dialects. The newer residents, mostly concentrated in Xincheng and Saihan Districts, speak Hohhot-based Mandarin, the majority also with a noticeable accent and some unique vocabulary.

=== Cuisine ===
Food specialty in the area is mostly focused on Mongol cuisine and dairy products. Commercially, Hohhot is known for being the base of the nationally renowned dairy giants Yili and Mengniu. The Mongol drink &quot;suutei tsai&quot; (), has become a typical breakfast selection for anyone living in or visiting the city. The city also has rich traditions in the making of hot pot and &quot;shaomai&quot;, a type of traditional Chinese dumpling served as dim sum.

== Transportation ==
=== Airport ===
Hohhot&#x27;s Baita International Airport (IATA:HET) is located about east of the city centre by car. It has direct flights to larger domestic cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Chengdu, and others. It also has flights to Taichung, Hong Kong, and Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

=== Railway ===
Hohhot lies on the Jingbao Railway from Beijing to Baotou, and is served by two railway stations: Hohhot railway station and Hohhot East railway station. The line began operation in 1921. Trains to Beijing link to destinations to the south and the northeast. The most prominent rail link with Beijing is the overnight K90 train, which has served the Hohhot-Beijing line since the 1980s and is referred to colloquially as the &quot;9-0&quot;. Westbound trains go through Baotou and Lanzhou. There are also rail links to most major Inner Mongolian cities and to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

Because the quickest trip to Beijing takes around six and a half hours despite the relatively close proximity of the two cities, plans for high-speed rail were discussed extensively prior to the construction of a high-speed railway station beginning in 2008. The station was completed in 2011 and initially serviced only ordinary lines. In January 2015, CRH opened its first D-series (&quot;dongchezu&quot;) route in Inner Mongolia in the Baotou-Hohhot-Jining corridor, shortening travel time between Inner Mongolia&#x27;s two largest cities to a mere 50 minutes. This line reached a maximum speed of between Hohhot and Baotou. Another high-speed rail line linking Hohhot to Zhangjiakou and the planned Beijing-Zhangjiakou railway are due for completion in 2017, and are designed to operate at . The section between Hohhot and Ulanqab (Jining) opened in August 2017; travel time between the two cities was shortened to 40 minutes.

=== Expressways ===
An expressway built in 1997 (then known as the Hubao Expressway) links Hohhot with Baotou. In recent years this expressway has been expanded eastwards to Jining and Zhangjiakou, and on to Beijing as part of the G6 Beijing–Lhasa Expressway (Jingzang Expressway). The city is on the route of China National Highway 110, which runs from Yinchuan to Beijing. China National Highway 209 begins in Hohhot and carries traffic southbound towards southern China, with its terminus in Guangxi. Hohhot is connected to its northern counties by the Huwu Highway, which was completed in 2006. Previously, travel to the northern counties had required lengthy navigation through mountainous terrain.

Long-distance buses connect Hohhot to outlying counties, the cities of Baotou, Wuhai, and Ordos, and other areas in Inner Mongolia.

=== Public transport and roadways ===

<doc id="261866" wikidata="Q4637611" url="?curid=261866" title="41 Original Hits from the Soundtrack of American Graffiti">
<text>41 Original Hits from the Soundtrack of American Graffiti is the official 1973 soundtrack album of the film &quot;American Graffiti&quot;. It has been certified triple platinum in the U.S., where it peaked at #10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart.

Included in the film, but not on the soundtrack, are &quot;Gee&quot; by the Crows, &quot;Louie Louie&quot; by Flash Cadillac &amp; the Continental Kids, and Harrison Ford&#x27;s in-character &quot;a cappella&quot; rendition of &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot; (though the reason for the latter two&#x27;s exclusion is because those sequences weren&#x27;t added to the film until the 1978 re-release, they were absent in the original 1973 released version)

A second compilation, titled &quot;More American Graffiti&quot; (MCA 8007) (and not to be confused with the 1979 film sequel of that name) was issued by MCA in early 1975 with George Lucas&#x27;s approval. It features more rock and doo-wop hits from the late 1950s and early 1960s (only one of which, the Crows&#x27; &quot;Gee&quot;, &quot;was&quot; featured in the film), along with additional Wolfman Jack dialogue. A third and final oldies compilation, titled &quot;American Graffiti Vol. III&quot; (MCA 8008) was also issued by MCA in early 1976. All three albums were released as 2-record sets, or as a double-length tape and are now entirely out of print.

All songs on the soundtrack album are presented in the order they appeared in the film.

The UK version of the soundtrack album is slightly reordered and omits three tracks; both Beach Boys songs and &quot;Teen Angel&quot; by Mark Dinning. The album is thus retitled &quot;38 Original Hits from the Sound Track of American Graffiti&quot;.

Wolfman Jack appears on seven tracks: &quot;That&#x27;ll Be The Day&quot;, &quot;Fannie Mae&quot;, &quot;Barbara Ann&quot;, &quot;Book of Love&quot;, &quot;To the Aisle&quot;, &quot;Green Onions&quot;, and &quot;Only You (And You Alone)&quot;.

==Differences between vinyl and CD releases==

Fats Domino&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot;: On the original vinyl release of the soundtrack, an alternate version including an overdubbed female chorus (created for Domino&#x27;s 1963 LP &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance with Domino&quot;) is used. The CD issue uses the original hit single recording.

&quot;Love Potion No. 9&quot; by the Clovers: The vinyl release features the LP version which concludes with the lyrics &quot;I had so much fun that I&#x27;m going back again. I wonder what will happen with Love Potion No. 10.&quot; The CD features the single version of the song which concludes by repeating the verse &quot;But when I kissed the cop at 34th and Vine, he broke my little bottle of Love Potion No. 9.&quot;

&quot;Party Doll&quot; by Buddy Knox: fades out earlier than the original version during the final chorus.

<doc id="261872" wikidata="Q392832" url="?curid=261872" title="Scarecrow and Mrs. King">
<text>Scarecrow and Mrs. King is an American television series that aired from October 3, 1983, to May 28, 1987, on CBS. The music underscore was composed by Arthur B. Rubinstein.

The show starred Kate Jackson and Bruce Boxleitner, as divorced housewife Amanda King and top-level &quot;Agency&quot; operative Lee Stetson, respectively, who begin an unusual partnership and eventual romance after encountering one another in a train station.

==Plot==
Amanda King is a divorced housewife who lives with her mother, Dotty, and her young sons, Philip and Jamie.

One morning, Agency operative Lee Stetson, code-named &quot;Scarecrow&quot;, hands her a package while he is being pursued. He instructs her to &quot;give it to the man in the red hat&quot;, but she is unable to complete the assignment, as there are many men in fezzes in the train car at the time. Scarecrow later has to track her down to recover the package, inadvertently getting her involved with his case. When Stetson is captured by his pursuers and marked for elimination, King ends up solving the secret behind the package, finding and rescuing Stetson, and even taking down their opponents, thereby getting introduced to the Agency.

Inquisitive, King seeks to learn more about the organization and ends up working for them, first in an office role and later receiving training to become a full agent, while keeping her new job a secret from her family. She works under Stetson&#x27;s boss, Billy Melrose, and with dismissive fellow agent Francine Desmond. Stetson and King work together even though he is initially reluctant to work with the &quot;rookie&quot; but eventually they become a good team.

The pair travel to places like Germany and England and help each other as they pose as other people, sometimes posing as husband and wife. Escapades involving cruise ships and getting &quot;married&quot; are some of their assignments, and the KGB or other enemies of the United States are always involved. Amanda&#x27;s ex-husband, Joe King, is still friendly with Amanda and is later suspected of murder.

Stetson and King develop a friendship that turns into a romantic relationship. While many suitors for King and Stetson appear, in the end they stay with each other. Stetson professes his love for King before going into hiding from the Agency, and he then proposes after her kidnapping. However, because of concerns for the safety of King&#x27;s family, they must keep the marriage secret from their employer, friends, and families.

I greatly appreciate the understanding and continued support I’ve received from everyone involved. Thank you to Harvey Shepherd and especially to Bud Grant for inviting me to join the CBS family. I love our show, but I believe it’s best right now that I avoid the many and at times highly stressful demands made of me in my role not only as actress, but as Producer, through my production company, Shoot the Moon Enterprises, LTD., as well as planning what direction the show will take as its creative consultant. I love doing it all, I love the cast and crew, as well as our many terrific fans and I thank you all for your well wishes, continued support and understanding. I’ll be back!”.

<doc id="261873" wikidata="Q1086395" url="?curid=261873" title="Virtue ethics">
<text>Virtue ethics (also aretaic ethics, from Greek []) is a philosophical approach that treats virtue and character as the primary subjects of ethics, in contrast to other ethical systems that put consequences of voluntary acts, principles or rules of conduct, or obedience to divine authority in the primary role.

Virtue ethics is usually contrasted with two other major approaches in ethics, consequentialism and deontology, which make the goodness of outcomes of an action (consequentialism) and the concept of moral duty (deontology) central. While virtue ethics does not necessarily deny the importance to ethics of goodness of states of affairs or of moral duties, it emphasizes virtue, and sometimes other concepts, like , to an extent that other ethics theories do not.

== Key concepts ==
===Virtue and vice===

In virtue ethics, a virtue is a characteristic disposition to think, feel, and act well in some domain of life. In contrast, a vice is a characteristic disposition to think, feel, and act poorly in some domain of life. Virtues are not everyday habits; they are character traits, in the sense that they are central to someone’s personality and what they are like as a person.

In early versions and some modern versions of virtue ethics, a virtue is defined as a character trait that promotes or exhibits human &quot;flourishing and well being&quot; in the person who exhibits it. Some modern versions of virtue ethics do not define virtues in terms of well being or flourishing, and some go so far as to define virtues as traits that tend to promote some other good that is defined independently of the virtues, thereby subsuming virtue ethics under (or somehow merging it with) consequentialist ethics.

To Aristotle, a virtue was not a skill that made you better able to achieve &quot;eudaimonia&quot; but was itself an expression of &quot;eudaimonia&quot; — eudaimonia in activity.

In contrast with consequentialist and deontological ethical systems, in which one may be called upon to do the right thing even though it is not in one&#x27;s own interests (one is to do it instead for the greater good, or out of duty), in virtue ethics, one does the right thing because it is in one&#x27;s own interests. Part of training in practical virtue ethics is to come to see the coincidence of one&#x27;s enlightened self-interest and the practice of the virtues, so that one is virtuous willingly, gladly, and enthusiastically because one knows that being virtuous is the best thing one can do with oneself.

=== Virtue and emotion ===
In ancient Greek and modern eudaimonic virtue ethics, virtues and vices are complex dispositions that involve both affective and intellectual components. That is, they are dispositions that involve both being able to reason well about the right thing to do (see below on ), and also to engage emotions and feelings correctly.

For example, a generous person can reason well about when and how to help people, and such a person also helps people with pleasure and without conflict. In this, virtuous people are contrasted not only with vicious people (who reason poorly about what to do and are emotionally attached to the wrong things) and with the incontinent (who are tempted by their feelings into doing the wrong thing even though they know what is right), but also with the merely continent (whose emotions tempt them toward doing the wrong thing but whose strength of will lets them do what they know is right).

According to Rosalind Hursthouse, in Aristotelian virtue ethics, the emotions have moral significance because &quot;virtues (and vices) are all dispositions not only to act, but to feel emotions, as reactions as well as impulses to action... [and] In the person with the virtues, these emotions will be felt on the &quot;right&quot; occasions, toward the &quot;right&quot; people or objects, for the &quot;right&quot; reasons, where &#x27;right&#x27; means &#x27;correct&#x27;...&quot;

=== and ===
 (; prudence, practical virtue, or practical wisdom) is an acquired trait that enables its possessor to identify the best thing to do in any given situation. Unlike theoretical wisdom, practical reason results in action or decision. As John McDowell puts it, practical wisdom involves a &quot;perceptual sensitivity&quot; to what a situation requires.

 () is a state variously translated from Greek as &#x27;well-being&#x27;, &#x27;happiness&#x27;, &#x27;blessedness&#x27;, and in the context of virtue ethics, &#x27;human flourishing&#x27;. in this sense is not a subjective, but an objective, state. It characterizes the well-lived life.

According to Aristotle, the most prominent exponent of in the Western philosophical tradition, defines the goal of human life. It consists of exercising the characteristic human quality—reason—as the soul&#x27;s most proper and nourishing activity. In his &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;, Aristotle, like Plato before him, argued that the pursuit of is an &quot;activity of the soul in accordance with perfect virtue&quot;, which further could only properly be exercised in the characteristic human community—the or city-state.

Although was first popularized by Aristotle, it now belongs to the tradition of virtue theories generally. For the virtue theorist, describes that state achieved by the person who lives the proper human life, an outcome that can be reached by practicing the virtues. A virtue is a habit or quality that allows the bearer to succeed at his, her, or its purpose. The virtue of a knife, for example, is sharpness; among the virtues of a racehorse is speed. Thus, to identify the virtues for human beings, one must have an account of what is the human purpose.

Not all modern virtue ethics theories are eudaimonic; some place another end in place of , while others are non-teleological: that is, they do not account for virtues in terms of the results that the practice of the virtues produce or tend to produce.

==History of virtue==

Like much of the Western tradition, virtue theory originated in ancient Greek philosophy.

Virtue ethics began with Socrates, and was subsequently developed further by Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics. Virtue ethics concentrates on the character of the individual, rather than the acts (or consequences thereof) of the individual. There is debate among adherents of virtue ethics concerning what specific virtues are praiseworthy. However, most theorists agree that ethics is demonstrated by the practice of virtues. 

Plato and Aristotle&#x27;s treatments of virtues are not the same. Plato believes virtue is effectively an end to be sought, for which a friend might be a useful means. Aristotle states that the virtues function more as means to safeguard human relations, particularly authentic friendship, without which one&#x27;s quest for happiness is frustrated.

Discussion of what were known as the four cardinal virtues—wisdom, justice, fortitude, and temperance—can be found in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;. The virtues also figure prominently in Aristotle&#x27;s ethical theory found in &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;.

Virtue theory was inserted into the study of history by moralistic historians such as Livy, Plutarch, and Tacitus. The Greek idea of the virtues was passed on in Roman philosophy through Cicero and later incorporated into Christian moral theology by Ambrose of Milan. During the scholastic period, the most comprehensive consideration of the virtues from a theological perspective was provided by Thomas Aquinas in his &quot;Summa Theologiae&quot; and his &quot;Commentaries on the Nicomachean Ethics&quot;.

After the Reformation, Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; continued to be the main authority for the discipline of ethics at Protestant universities until the late seventeenth century, with over fifty Protestant commentaries published on the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; before 1682.

Though the tradition receded into the background of European philosophical thought in the past few centuries, the term &quot;virtue&quot; remained current during this period, and in fact appears prominently in the tradition of classical republicanism or classical liberalism. This tradition was prominent in the intellectual life of 16th-century Italy, as well as 17th- and 18th-century Britain and America; indeed the term &quot;virtue&quot; appears frequently in the work of Tomás Fernández de Medrano, Niccolò Machiavelli, David Hume, the republicans of the English Civil War period, the 18th-century English Whigs, and the prominent figures among the Scottish Enlightenment and the American Founding Fathers.

Although some Enlightenment philosophers (e.g. Hume) continued to emphasise the virtues, with the ascendancy of utilitarianism and deontological ethics, virtue theory moved to the margins of Western philosophy. The contemporary revival of virtue theory is frequently traced to the philosopher Elizabeth Anscombe&#x27;s 1958 essay &quot;Modern Moral Philosophy&quot;. Following this:
* In the 1976 paper &quot;The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories&quot;, Michael Stocker summarises the main aretaic criticisms of deontological and consequentialist ethics.
* Philosopher, psychologist, and encyclopedist Mortimer Adler appealed to Aristotelian ethics, and the virtue theory of happiness or throughout his published work.
* Philippa Foot, published a collection of essays in 1978 entitled &quot;Virtues and Vices&quot;.
* Alasdair MacIntyre made an effort to reconstruct a virtue-based theory in dialogue with the problems of modern and postmodern thought; his works include &quot;After Virtue&quot; and &quot;Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry&quot;.
* Paul Ricoeur accorded an important place to Aristotelian teleological ethics in his hermeneutical phenomenology of the subject, most notably in his book &quot;Oneself as Another&quot;.
* Theologian Stanley Hauerwas found the language of virtue helpful in his own project.
* Richard Taylor argues for the restoration of classical virtues as the basis for morality in &quot;Virtue Ethics An Introduction&quot; (1991)
* Roger Crisp and Michael Slote edited a collection of important essays titled &quot;Virtue Ethics&quot;.
* Martha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen employed virtue theory in theorising the capability approach to international development.
* Julia Annas wrote &quot;The Morality of Happiness&quot; (1993).
* Lawrence C. Becker identified current virtue theory with Greek Stoicism in &quot;A New Stoicism.&quot; (1998).
* Rosalind Hursthouse published &quot;On Virtue Ethics&quot; (1999).
* Psychologist Martin Seligman drew on classical virtue ethics in conceptualizing positive psychology.
* Psychologist Daniel Goleman opens his book on Emotional Intelligence with a challenge from Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;.
* Michael Sandel discusses Aristotelian ethics to support his ethical theory of justice in his book &quot;&quot;

The aretaic turn in moral philosophy is paralleled by analogous developments in other philosophical disciplines. One of these is epistemology, where a distinctive virtue epistemology was developed by Linda Zagzebski and others. In political theory, there has been discussion of &quot;virtue politics&quot;, and in legal theory, there is a small but growing body of literature on virtue jurisprudence. The aretaic turn also exists in American constitutional theory, where proponents argue for an emphasis .

Aretaic approaches to morality, epistemology, and jurisprudence have been the subject of intense debates. One criticism focuses on the problem of guidance; one opponent, Robert Louden in his article &quot;Some Vices of Virtue Ethics&quot;, questions whether the idea of a virtuous moral actor, believer, or judge can provide the guidance necessary for action, belief formation, or the resolution of legal disputes.

== Lists of virtues ==
There are several lists of virtues. Socrates argued that virtue is knowledge, which suggests that there is really only one virtue. The Stoics identified four cardinal virtues: wisdom, justice, courage, and temperance. Wisdom is subdivided into good sense, good calculation, quick-wittedness, discretion, and resourcefulness. Justice is subdivided into piety, honesty, equity, and fair dealing. Courage is subdivided into endurance, confidence, high-mindedness, cheerfulness, and industriousness. Temperance or moderation is subdivided into good discipline, seemliness, modesty, and self-control.

John McDowell argues that virtue is a &quot;perceptual capacity&quot; to identify how one ought to act, and that all particular virtues are merely &quot;specialized sensitivities&quot; to a range of reasons for acting.

===Aristotle&#x27;s list===
Aristotle identifies 12 virtues that demonstrate a person is performing their human function well. He distinguished virtues pertaining to emotion and desire from those relating to the mind. The first he calls moral virtues, and the second intellectual virtues (though both are &quot;moral&quot; in the modern sense of the word).

==== Moral virtues ====
Aristotle suggested that each moral virtue was a golden mean between two corresponding vices, one of excess and one of deficiency. Each intellectual virtue is a mental skill or habit by which the mind arrives at truth, affirming what is or denying what is not. In the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;. he discusses 11 moral virtues:
==== Intellectual virtues ====
# (intelligence), which apprehends fundamental truths (such as definitions, self-evident principles)
# (science), which is skill with inferential reasoning (such as proofs, syllogisms, demonstrations)
# (theoretical wisdom), which combines fundamental truths with valid, necessary inferences to reason well about unchanging truths.
Aristotle also mentions several other traits: 
* (good sense) – passing judgment, &quot;sympathetic understanding&quot;
* (understanding) – comprehending what others say, does not issue commands
* (practical wisdom) – knowledge of what to do, knowledge of changing truths, issues commands
* (art, craftsmanship)

Aristotle&#x27;s list is not the only list, however. As Alasdair MacIntyre observed in &quot;After Virtue&quot;, thinkers as diverse as Homer, the authors of the New Testament, Thomas Aquinas, and Benjamin Franklin have all proposed lists. Walter Kaufmann proposed as the four cardinal virtues: ambition/humility (&quot;humbition&quot;), love, courage, and honesty.

==Criticisms==
Proponents of virtue theory sometimes argue that a central feature of a virtue is its &quot;universal applicability&quot;. In other words, any character trait defined as a virtue must reasonably be universally regarded as a virtue for all people. According to this view, it is inconsistent to claim, for example, servility as a female virtue, while at the same time not proposing it as a male one.

Other proponents of virtue theory, notably Alasdair MacIntyre, respond to this objection by arguing that any account of the virtues must indeed be generated out of the community in which those virtues are to be practiced: the very word &quot;ethics&quot; implies . That is to say that the virtues are, and necessarily must be, grounded in a particular time and place. What counts as a virtue in Athens would be a ludicrous guide to proper behaviour in Toronto and vice versa. To take this view does not necessarily commit one to the argument that accounts of the virtues must therefore be static: moral activity—that is, attempts to contemplate and practice the virtues—can provide the cultural resources that allow people to change, albeit slowly, the of their own societies. 

MacIntyre appears to take this position in his seminal work on virtue ethics, &quot;After Virtue&quot;. 

Another objection to virtue theory is that virtue ethics does not focus on what &quot;sorts of actions&quot; are morally permitted and which ones are not, but rather on what sort of qualities someone ought to foster in order to become a good person. In other words, while some virtue theorists may not condemn, for example, murder as an inherently immoral or impermissible sort of action, they may argue that someone who commits a murder is severely lacking in several important virtues, such as compassion and . Still, antagonists of the theory often object that this particular feature of the theory makes virtue ethics useless as a universal norm of acceptable conduct suitable as a base for legislation. Some virtue theorists concede this point, but respond by opposing the very notion of legitimate legislative authority instead, effectively advocating some form of anarchism as the political ideal. Other virtue theorists argue that laws should be made by virtuous legislators, and still another group argue that it is possible to base a judicial system on the moral notion of virtues rather than rules. Aristotle himself saw his &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; as a prequel for his &quot;Politics&quot; and felt that the point of politics was to create the fertile soil for a virtuous citizenry to develop in, and that one purpose of virtue was that it helps you to contribute to a healthy .

Some virtue theorists might respond to this overall objection with the notion of a &quot;bad act&quot; also being an act characteristic of vice. That is to say that those acts that do not aim at virtue, or that stray from virtue, would constitute our conception of &quot;bad behavior&quot;. Although not all virtue ethicists agree to this notion, this is one way the virtue ethicist can re-introduce the concept of the &quot;morally impermissible&quot;. One could raise an objection that he is committing an argument from ignorance by postulating that what is not virtuous is unvirtuous. In other words, just because an action or person &#x27;lacks of evidence&#x27; for virtue does not, all else constant, imply that said action or person is unvirtuous.

=== Subsumed in deontology and utilitarianism ===

Martha Nussbaum suggested that while virtue ethics is often considered to be anti-Enlightenment, &quot;suspicious of theory and respectful of the wisdom embodied in local practices&quot;, it is actually neither fundamentally distinct from, nor does it qualify as a rival approach to deontology and utilitarianism. She argues that philosophers from these two Enlightenment traditions often include theories of virtue. She pointed out that Kant&#x27;s &quot;Doctrine of Virtue&quot; (in &quot;The Metaphysics of Morals&quot;) &quot;covers most of the same topics as do classical Greek theories&quot;, &quot;that he offers a general account of virtue, in terms of the strength of the will in overcoming wayward and selfish inclinations; that he offers detailed analyses of standard virtues such as courage and self-control, and of vices, such as avarice, mendacity, servility, and pride; that, although in general, he portrays inclination as inimical to virtue, he also recognizes that sympathetic inclinations offer crucial support to virtue, and urges their deliberate cultivation.&quot;

Nussbaum also points to considerations of virtue by utilitarians such as Henry Sidgwick (&quot;The Methods of Ethics&quot;), Jeremy Bentham (&quot;The Principles of Morals and Legislation&quot;), and John Stuart Mill, who writes of moral development as part of an argument for the moral equality of women (&quot;The Subjection of Women&quot;). She argues that contemporary virtue ethicists such as Alasdair MacIntyre, Bernard Williams, Philippa Foot, and John McDowell have few points of agreement and that the common core of their work does not represent a break from Kant.

=== Kantian critique ===

Immanuel Kant&#x27;s position on virtue ethics is contested. Those who argue that Kantian deontology conflicts with virtue ethics include Alasdair MacIntyre, Philippa Foot, and Bernard Williams. In the &quot;Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals&quot; and the &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot;, Immanuel Kant offers many different criticisms of ethical frameworks and against moral theories before him. Kant rarely mentioned Aristotle by name but did not exclude his moral philosophy of virtue ethics from his critique. Many Kantian arguments against virtue ethics claim that virtue ethics is inconsistent, or sometimes that it is not a real moral theory at all.

In &quot;What Is Virtue Ethics All About?&quot;, Gregory Velazco y Trianosky identified the key points of divergence between virtue ethicists and what he called &quot;neo-Kantianism&quot;, in the form these nine neo-Kantian moral assertions:

# The crucial moral question is &quot;what is it right/obligatory to do?&quot;
# Moral judgments are those that concern the rightness of actions.
# Such judgments take the form of rules or principles.
# Such rules or principles are universal, not respecting persons.
# They are not based on some concept of human good that is independent of moral goodness.
# They take the form of categorical imperatives that can be justified independently of the desires of the person they apply to.
# They are motivating; they can compel action in an agent, also independently of that agent&#x27;s desires.
# An action, in order to be morally virtuous, must be motivated by this sort of moral judgment (not, for example, merely coincidentally aligned with it).
# The virtuousness of a character trait, or virtue, derives from the relationship that trait has to moral judgments, rules, and principles.

Trianosky says that modern sympathizers with virtue ethics almost all reject neo-Kantian claim #1, and many of them also reject certain of the other claims.

=== Utopianism and pluralism ===

Robert B. Louden criticizes virtue ethics on the basis that it promotes a form of unsustainable utopianism. Trying to arrive at a single set of virtues is immensely difficult in contemporary societies as, according to Louden, they contain &quot;more ethnic, religious, and class groups than did the moral community which Aristotle theorized about&quot; with each of these groups having &quot;not only its own interests but its own set of virtues as well&quot;. Louden notes in passing that MacIntyre, a supporter of virtue-based ethics, has grappled with this in &quot;After Virtue&quot; but that ethics cannot dispense with building rules around acts and rely only on discussing the moral character of persons.

== Topics in virtue ethics ==

=== Virtue ethics as a category ===

Virtue contrasts with deontological and consequentialist ethics; the three are the most predominant contemporary normative-ethical theories. Deontological ethics, sometimes referred to as duty ethics, emphasizes adherence to ethical principles or duties. How these duties are defined, however, is often a subject of debate. One rule scheme used by deontologists is divine command theory. Deontology also depends upon meta-ethical realism in postulating the existence of moral absolutes, regardless of circumstances. Immanuel Kant is considered a foremost theorist of deontological ethics.

The next predominant school of thought in normative ethics is consequentialism. While deontology emphasizes doing one&#x27;s duty, consequentialism bases the morality of an action on its outcome. Instead of saying that one has a moral duty to abstain from murder, a consequentialist would say that we should abstain from murder because it has undesirable effects. The main contention is what outcomes should (or can) be identified as objectively desirable.

John Stuart Mill&#x27;s greatest happiness principle is a commonly-adopted criterion of what is objectively desirable. Mill asserts that the desirability of an action is the net amount of happiness it brings, the number of people it brings happiness to, and the duration of that happiness. He tries to delineate classes of happiness, some preferable to others, but classifying such a concept is difficult.

A virtue ethicist identifies virtues (also known as desirable characteristics) that a good person embodies. Exhibiting these virtues is the aim of ethics, and one&#x27;s actions are a reflection of one&#x27;s virtues. To the virtue philosopher, action cannot be used as a demarcation of morality because a virtue encompasses more than a selection of an action; it is a way of being that leads the person exhibiting the virtue to consistently make certain types of choices. There is disagreement in virtue ethics about what are, and what are not, virtues. There are also difficulties in identifying the &quot;virtuous&quot; action to take in all circumstances, and how to define a virtue.

Consequentialist and deontological theories often still employ the term &quot;virtue&quot; in a restricted sense: as a tendency (or disposition) to adhere to the system&#x27;s principles or rules. In those theories, virtue is secondary and the principles (or rules) are primary. These differing senses of what constitutes virtue are a potential source of confusion.
Dogmatic claims about the purpose of human life, or about what a good life is for human beings, are typically controversial.

=== Virtue and politics ===
Virtue theory emphasizes Aristotle&#x27;s belief in the as the acme of political organization, and the role of the virtues in enabling human beings to flourish in that environment. In contrast, classical republicanism emphasizes Tacitus&#x27;s concern that power and luxury can corrupt individuals and destroy liberty, as Tacitus perceived in the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. Virtue for classical republicans is a shield against this sort of corruption and a means to preserve the good life one has, rather than a means by which to achieve the good life one does not yet have. Another way to put the distinction between the two traditions is that virtue ethics relies on Aristotle&#x27;s fundamental distinction between the human-being-as-he-is from the human-being-as-he-should-be, while classical republicanism relies on the Tacitean distinction of the risk-of-becoming.

Virtue ethics has a number of contemporary applications:

;Social and political philosophy
Within the field of social ethics, Deirdre McCloskey argues that virtue ethics can provide a basis for a balanced approach to understanding capitalism and capitalist societies.
;Education
Within the field of philosophy of education, James Page argues that virtue ethics can provide a rationale and foundation for peace education.
; Health care and medical ethics
Thomas Alured Faunce argued that whistleblowing in healthcare settings would be more respected within clinical governance pathways if it had a firmer academic foundation in virtue ethics. He called for whistleblowing to be expressly supported in the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights. Barry Schwartz argues that &quot;practical wisdom&quot; is an antidote to much of the inefficient and inhumane bureaucracy of modern health care systems.
;Technology and the virtues
In her book &quot;Technology and the Virtues&quot;, Shannon Vallor proposed a series of &quot;technomoral&quot; virtues that people need to cultivate in order to flourish in our socio-technological world: Honesty (Respecting Truth), Self-control (Becoming the Author of Our Desires), Humility (Knowing What We Do Not Know), Justice (Upholding Rightness), Courage (Intelligent Fear and Hope), Empathy (Compassionate Concern for Others), Care (Loving Service to Others), Civility (Making Common Cause), Flexibility (Skillful Adaptation to Change), Perspective (Holding on to the Moral Whole), and Magnanimity (Moral Leadership and Nobility of Spirit).

<doc id="261876" wikidata="Q4659011" url="?curid=261876" title="A Presumption of Death">
<text>A Presumption of Death is a 2002 Lord Peter Wimsey–Harriet Vane mystery novel by Jill Paton Walsh, based loosely on &quot;The Wimsey Papers&quot; by Dorothy L. Sayers. The novel is Walsh&#x27;s first original Lord Peter Wimsey novel, following &quot;Thrones, Dominations&quot;, which Sayers left as an unfinished manuscript, and was completed by Walsh. &quot;A Presumption of Death&quot; is written by Walsh, except for excerpts from &quot;The Wimsey Papers&quot;.

==Plot==
Harriet (Lady Peter Wimsey) has evacuated her family to the Wimseys&#x27; country house, Talboys in Hertfordshire, taking her two children, along with the three children of her sister-in-law, Lady Mary, and Peter&#x27;s venerable old housekeeper, Mrs Trapp. Peter and Bunter are away on an undercover assignment.

During an ARP drill, a young woman is murdered in the village, and Superintendent Kirk (who last appeared in &quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot;) recruits Harriet to help solve the murder, as the police are short-staffed due to the war and Harriet, as a crime novelist and the wife of a detective, is felt to be the best-qualified available person to find the murderer.

The murdered girl, Wendy Percival, had come from the city as a Land Girl, to do agricultural work and help the war effort. She was killed in the village street while most people were in the village&#x27;s two air raid shelters during the drill, and much of the investigation turns on who had been, or could have been, outside the shelters when the murder was committed. Patient investigation leads Harriet to eliminate several potential suspects, including two young men in the village with whom Wendy flirted and the RAF pilot who was last with her on the night she died. She also establishes that everyone in the shelters is accounted for, and that there was no way for anyone to leave either shelter unnoticed during the drill. Glumly, she reflects that her list of possible suspects has been reduced to a random &quot;wandering maniac&quot;.

Returning home from one of her investigations, Harriet encounters &quot;Bungo&quot;, Peter&#x27;s old school friend and now a high-ranking officer in British Intelligence, who has received a coded message from Peter which Peter had said only she could decipher. The message is based on a book code, and after thinking carefully she realises that the key to the code is the sonnet which she started and Peter completed in &quot;Gaudy Night&quot;. The decoded message says that Peter and Bunter have accomplished their mission, but their danger is now great and they must come home separately. They require assistance to get home, and the message says which routes they will be taking. By solving the cipher, Harriet has saved Peter&#x27;s life, just as he once saved her life. The message also instructs Harriet, in the event of his death, to read the letter he left for her in his bureau. Handling the unopened letter, Harriet reflects ruefully on the years she spent avoiding Peter&#x27;s proposals of marriage, when all she wants now is to be with him again. Then she realises that she married him when the time was right for her, and that to have &quot;settled&quot; on the wrong terms would have been disastrous for both of them.

===Bunter returns===
On a brief trip to London to meet the Wimsey family solicitor, Harriet is trapped in the basement of her old home by a sudden air raid, and is surprised to encounter a dishevelled Bunter, returned home from his and Peter&#x27;s mission. He says he has no word from Peter. The following week, he appears at Talboys to resume service with the household, since he has been denied permission to re-enlist in the army because of his age.

At the suggestion of Peter&#x27;s sister Mary, Harriet summarises her progress in the murder investigation in letters to Peter, which she does not send. While writing one of these letters, Harriet realises that there is one person she has overlooked: an RAF pilot named Alan Brinklow, billeted in the village while recovering from a broken ankle. Not being a villager, he would not have been in either of the air raid shelters, but not being posted to any of the surrounding air bases, he would not have been expected there either. Although she has no reason to suspect Brinklow of having a motive to kill Wendy, Superintendent Kirk agrees to question him.

===Peter returns===
Peter returns, alive and well, to Harriet&#x27;s immense relief and joy. A short time later, Kirk returns to Talboys to report that Brinklow&#x27;s dead body has been found buried behind a farmer&#x27;s shed. Peter is confused, saying he recognises the name Brinklow from his own mission and the man is already long dead.

Bungo is summoned to Talboys, and is present as Peter explains that Alan Brinklow was shot down over the North Sea some weeks ago; his body was recovered by a British patrol boat, whose captain decided to plant some false papers on the body and send it drifting into enemy territory, hoping to mislead the enemy. The ploy worked, but the Germans decided to infiltrate an enemy agent into Britain, using Brinklow&#x27;s name, as they thought the British were unaware that the real Brinklow was dead. The &quot;Brinklow&quot; who had been living in Paggleham for the past few weeks was actually a German spy.

Bungo explains that &quot;pseudo-Brinklow&quot; is unlikely to have been killed by anyone from British Intelligence, as they would want any enemy agent captured alive. Kirk is at a loss for any other suspects, until Harriet suggests that the real Alan Brinklow might have had an enemy for some reason. In Brinklow&#x27;s records, Peter and Harriet trace the name of a young woman, Joan Quarley, living in Northumberland. When they confront Joan&#x27;s brother, an RAF pilot named Jeff, he admits that Alan was his squadmate, and that he and Joan fell in love, and she became pregnant with his child before his last mission.

Officially they were told that Alan was missing and presumed dead, but then they heard rumours that an &quot;Alan Brinklow&quot; was living in Paggleham. Jeff went there to confront Alan, and forced pseudo-Brinklow to meet him in private, at night. Not seeing the man clearly, Jeff demanded to know what &quot;Alan&quot; was going to do about Joan. When the man responded, &quot;Who is Joan?&quot;, Jeff went berserk and attacked him. Finding himself in a fight to the death, Jeff drew a knife and tried to cut Alan&#x27;s hamstrings, but accidentally cut the man&#x27;s throat instead. Seeing the man in the light, Jeff saw that it was not Alan after all, so he buried the body in a panic and fled Paggleham.

After repeating this story for Bungo, Superintendent Kirk, and his commanding officer, Jeff is allowed to return to duty. Bungo tells Mrs Quarley that Jeff will not be charged with any crime, and the real Alan Brinklow acted honourably and died bravely. Mrs Quarley, who suspected Jeff&#x27;s role in pseudo-Brinklow&#x27;s murder, is vastly relieved, while Joan is triumphant, vindicated in her faith in the man she loved.

===Return from Northumberland===
On their way back to Hertfordshire, Peter and Harriet make a brief overnight stop at Duke&#x27;s Denver, where Peter reflects that his nephew, Lord St. George, also an RAF pilot, is unlikely to survive the war, which would mean that Peter would become the heir to the dukedom. However, Peter is determined that he and Harriet will raise their sons as &quot;normal&quot; boys, not as aristocrats, since the privileges accorded to the nobility become harder to justify with each passing year, and will become even harder to justify when the war is over.

Over dinner with Peter&#x27;s mother, the Dowager Duchess, the news service announces Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s resignation as Prime Minister and his replacement by Winston Churchill, who promises only &quot;blood, toil, tears and sweat&quot;.

Returning to Talboys, Harriet says she is unhappy to be coming home to a still-unsolved murder. Peter says that, on the contrary, Harriet did solve Wendy Percival&#x27;s murder, having eliminated all the possible suspects except pseudo-Brinklow. As to his motive, Peter says they may never know for sure, but he can make an educated guess: Wendy, who traveled extensively in Europe before the war and was drawn to handsome men of any nationality, must have met pseudo-Brinklow in Germany, and recognised him instantly when they encountered each other, by chance, in the village during the drill. He had no choice but to silence her immediately. Harriet remarks that it is a strange inversion: pseudo-Brinklow killed Wendy because she recognised him for who he really was, yet he was killed himself because of who he was pretending to be.

===The radio signals===
The only mystery, Peter says, is exactly what pseudo-Brinklow&#x27;s mission in Paggleham was. This mystery is solved by, of all people, Peter&#x27;s ten-year-old nephew, Charlie Parker, and his friend from the village, Sam Bateson. Charlie got a crystal radio set from Lord St. George as a present, but was frustrated because it had an intermittent fault. Now he realises it was working perfectly, but intercepting signals from a transmitter in the village: the last of which occurred just before pseudo-Brinklow was killed. Charlie and Sam borrowed a book on Morse code and wrote down their intercepts, even though they cannot decipher them. Peter delivers the intercepts to Bungo, and a few days later a secret air base near Paggleham is closed and relocated.

Peter is retired from active service and, while still involved in intelligence, assures Harriet that he will not be sent abroad again. He confesses to Harriet his worry that being married to her, and fathering their children, has sapped his bravery, and made him unfit to undertake another assignment. Harriet shrewdly points out that this is not true: she recalls Bunter&#x27;s account of his separation from Peter during the mission, when one of them had to go home by the safer of two routes, and they decided to flip a coin for it. Bunter suspected, and Peter now admits to Harriet, that Peter deliberately faked the coin toss to send Bunter home by the safer route. Peter is reminded of why he loves Harriet: she sees him more clearly than he sees himself. Embracing her, he shows her a copy of Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; and they read the last passage together, that true love between two persons is not war, but it is the surest form of victory.

<doc id="261881" wikidata="Q391639" url="?curid=261881" title="Polyphase system">
<text>A polyphase system (the term coined by Silvanus Thompson) is a means of distributing alternating-current (AC) electrical power that utilizes more than one AC phase, which refers to the phase offset value (in degrees) between AC in multiple conducting wires; &quot;phases&quot; may also refer to the corresponding terminals and conductors, as in color codes. Polyphase systems have two or more energized electrical conductors carrying alternating currents with a defined phase between the voltage waves in each conductor. Early systems used 4 wire two-phase with a 90° phase angle, but modern systems almost universally use three-phase voltage, with a phase angle of 120° (or 2π/3 radians). 

Polyphase systems are particularly useful for transmitting power to electric motors which rely on alternating current to rotate. Three-phase power is used for industrial applications and for power transmission. Compared to a single-phase, two-wire system, a three-phase three-wire system transmits three times as much power for the same conductor size and voltage, using only 1.5 times as many conductors, making it twice as efficient in conductor utilization.

Systems with more than three phases are often used for rectifier and power conversion systems, and have been studied for power transmission.

==Number of phases==
In the very early days of commercial electric power, some installations used two-phase four-wire systems for motors. The chief advantage of these was that the winding configuration was the same as for a single-phase capacitor-start motor and, by using a four-wire system, conceptually the phases were independent and easy to analyse with mathematical tools available at the time.

Two-phase systems can also be implemented using three wires (two &quot;hot&quot; plus a common neutral). However this introduces asymmetry; the voltage drop in the neutral makes the phases not exactly 90 degrees apart.

Two-phase systems have been replaced with three-phase systems. The move from two to three phases was originally motivated by making a more ideal rotating field for AC motors: Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky calculated that, for simple winding configurations of the time, the magnetic field fluctuation can be reduced from 40% to 15%. This is less important in modern machines that create a nearly ideal rotating field using sinusoidally distributed windings, but three-phase systems retain other advantages.

A two-phase supply with 90 degrees between phases can be derived from a three-phase system using a Scott-connected transformer, which can also produce three-phase power from a two-phase input.

A polyphase system must provide a defined direction of phase rotation, so mirror image voltages do not count towards the phase order. A 3-wire system with two phase conductors 180 degrees apart is still only single phase. Such systems are sometimes described as split-phase.

==Motors==
Polyphase power is particularly useful in AC motors, such as the induction motor, where it generates a rotating magnetic field. When a three-or-more-phase supply completes one full cycle, the magnetic field of a two-poles-per-phase motor has rotated through 360° in physical space; motors with more than two poles per phase require more power supply cycles to complete one physical revolution of the magnetic field and so these motors run more slowly. Induction motors using a rotating magnetic field were independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla and developed in a three-phase form by Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky in 1889. Previously all commercial motors were DC, with expensive commutators, high-maintenance brushes and characteristics unsuitable for operation on an alternating current network. Polyphase motors are simple to construct, are self-starting and have little vibration compared with single-phase motors.

==Higher phase order==
Once polyphase power is available, it may be converted to any desired number of phases with a suitable arrangement of transformers. Thus, the need for more than three phases is unusual, but higher phase numbers than three have been used.

High-phase-order (HPO) power transmission has been frequently proposed as a way to increase transmission capacity within a limited-width right of way. Transmitted power is proportional to the square of the phase-to-ground voltage drop, but transmission lines require conductors spaced adequately distant to prevent both phase-to-ground and phase-to-phase electrical arcs. For three-phase power, the phase-to-phase voltage, which is times the phase-to-ground voltage, dominates. Higher-phase systems at the same phase-to-ground voltage have less voltage difference between adjacent phases, allowing a tighter conductor spacing. For six- and higher-phase power systems, the dominant effect becomes the phase-to-ground voltage instead. 

Six-phase operation thus lets an existing double-circuit transmission line carry more power without requiring additional conductor cable. However, it requires the capital expense and impedance losses of new phase-converting transformers to interface with the conventional three-phase grid. They are particularly economical when the alternative is upgrading an existing extra high voltage (EHV, more than 345 kV phase-to-phase) transmission line to ultra-high voltage (UHV, more than 800 kV) standards.

Between 1992 and 1995, New York State Electric &amp; Gas operated a 1.5 mile 93kV 6-phase transmission line converted from a double-circuit 3-phase 115kV transmission line. The primary result was that it is economically favorable to operate an existing double-circuit 115kV 3-phase line as a 6-phase line for distances greater than 23–28 miles. 

Three-phase power lines rely on transposition to equalize across all phases transmission losses due to slight deviations from ideal geometry. This is not possible with higher-phase lines, because a transposition can only swap adjacent phases, and the dihedral group on elements coincides with the full symmetric group only for . Full application of even that limited transposition scheme is necessary to properly protect against ground faults. 

Multi-phase power generation designs with 5, 7, 9, 12, and 15 phases in conjunction with multi-phase induction generators (MPIGs) driven by wind turbines have been proposed. An induction generator produces electrical power when its rotor is turned faster than the &quot;synchronous speed&quot;. A multi-phase induction generator has more poles, and therefore a lower synchronous speed. Since the rotation speed of a wind turbine may be too slow for a substantial portion of its operation to generate single-phase or even three-phase AC power, higher phase orders allow the system to capture a larger portion of the rotational energy as electric power.

<text>The Zhaojun Tomb (), located by the Da Hi River nine kilometers south of Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, is said to be the resting place of Wang Zhaojun, a commoner woman from the Han dynasty who married a Xiongnu &quot;Chanyu&quot;, nomadic chieftain from the steppes. The tomb is also referred to by its Mongolian name, Temür Urkhu (), meaning &quot;Iron Wall&quot;. Another nickname, &quot;Green Mound&quot; (), refers to a legend that in autumn, when grass and trees wither, those plants on the cemetery mound continue to prosper.

The tomb, one of the major attractions in the city of Hohhot, occupies some 13,000 m2 of land, with a 33-metre mound containing Zhaojun&#x27;s coffin. The tomb is honorary, Wang Zhaojun is not actually buried here. Her true grave and cause of death is unknown. Still the &quot;tomb&quot; is visited by thousands of Chinese tourists each year and is noted for its attractive scenery.

The first Chinese mention of the cemetery in written record is in the Tang dynasty, by Du You () in &quot;A Comprehensive Guide&quot; (). Former Chinese head of state Dong Biwu wrote the inscription on the entrance plaque to the tomb.

<doc id="261883" wikidata="Q6064498" url="?curid=261883" title="American Rivers Conference">
<text>The American Rivers Conference (A-R-C) is an intercollegiate athletic conference that competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III. From 1927 until August 9, 2018, it was known officially as the Iowa Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (IIAC) and commonly as the Iowa Conference.

==History==
The A-R-C dates back to December 8, 1922, when representatives from 12 colleges formed the Iowa Intercollegiate Athletic Association. Charter members were Buena Vista College, Central University of Iowa, Ellsworth College, Iowa Wesleyan College, Luther College, Morningside College, Parsons College, St. Ambrose College, Simpson College, Upper Iowa University, Western Union College and Penn College. Des Moines University was voted into the conference at that meeting as well.

The first Conference constitution was published in January 1923. Also that year, Judge Hubert Utterback of Des Moines, Iowa was named the first conference commissioner and Iowa Teachers (now known as the University of Northern Iowa) was accepted as a member. Columbia College (now known as Loras College) was admitted in 1926. Ellsworth left the conference in 1927. That spring, the conference&#x27;s name was changed to the &quot;Iowa Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.&quot; After a three-year ban, athletics were reinstated at the University of Dubuque in 1928–29, and it joined the conference in 1929. Wartburg College was admitted to the conference in 1936, beginning competition the following year. Morningside dropped out in 1936 because of inactivity. William Penn was suspended from the conference in 1949 for using ineligible players. The school was back in the conference in 1951, though it did not compete in football until later. In 1951, St. Ambrose and Loras dropped from football competition.

The Iowa Conference reorganized in 1953, effective with the 1954–55 school year. Nine schools remained in the conference: Buena Vista, Central, Dubuque, Iowa Wesleyan, Luther, Parsons, Simpson, Upper Iowa and Wartburg. William Penn was re-admitted to the conference in 1960, effective in the spring of 1962. Parsons left the conference around 1963, while Iowa Wesleyan left effective June 1, 1965. Loras re-joined the conference in 1986, increasing the conference membership to nine schools, which continued until 1997 when Coe and Cornell left the Midwest Conference to join the IIAC. The Conference was at 11 schools until its 80th-anniversary year (2001–02) when William Penn decided to leave and switch its affiliation from the NCAA to the NAIA. The IIAC became a nine-school conference when Upper Iowa reclassified to NCAA Division II prior to the start of the 2003–04 academic year and fell back to eight schools with Cornell&#x27;s return to the Midwest Conference following the 2011–12 academic year.

The conference expanded beyond the borders of Iowa in 2016 with the addition of Nebraska Wesleyan University. On August 9, 2018, the league changed its name to the American Rivers Conference to reflect its current makeup.

<text>&quot;Chinese Taipei&quot; is the term used in various international organizations and tournaments for groups or delegations representing the Republic of China (ROC), a country commonly known as Taiwan.

Due to the One-China principle stipulated by the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC, China), Taiwan, being a non-UN member after its expulsion in 1971 with ongoing dispute of its sovereignty, was prohibited from using or displaying any of its national symbols that would represent the statehood of Taiwan, such as its national name, anthem and flag, at international events. The term &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot; was first proposed in 1979 and was eventually approved in the Nagoya Resolution, whereby the ROC/Taiwan and the PRC/China had their right of participation and would remain as separate teams in any activities of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and its correlates. This term came into official use in 1981 following a name change of the Republic of China Olympic Committee (ROCOC) to the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee. This arrangement later became a model for the ROC/Taiwan to continue participating in various international organizations and diplomatic affairs other than the Olympic Games, including the World Trade Organization, the World Health Organization, the Metre Convention, APEC, and international pageants.

&quot;Chinese Taipei&quot; is a deliberately ambiguous term, designed to be equivocal about the political status of the ROC/Taiwan. The meaning of &quot;Chinese&quot; (, ) is also ambiguous, so that either party is able to interpret it as national identity or cultural sphere (similar to ethnonyms as Anglo, Arab, Hispanic or Iranian). The specific mention of &quot;Taipei&quot;, the capital city of the ROC, is to avoid disputes over the territorial extent of the ROC. Since the IOC has ruled out the use of the name &quot;Republic of China&quot;, the neologism was considered as an expedient resolution and a more inclusive term than just &quot;Taiwan&quot; to both the Kuomintang, the ruling party of the ROC at the time during the Nagoya Resolution, and the PRC. The PRC&#x27;s persistent policy is to keep Taipei isolated on the world stage and disagrees with any use of &quot;Taiwan&quot; as an official title, in order to prevent Taiwan from gaining international recognition for &quot;independent statehood&quot; separate from the PRC. The term &quot;Taiwan, China&quot; or &quot;Taipei, China&quot; was rejected by the ROC government because it could be construed as Taiwan being a subordinate region to the PRC.

Popular opinion in Taiwan has changed drastically in regard to the cross-strait relations and the nationalistic discourses since the democratization of Taiwan and the end of one-party rule by the Kuomintang. &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot; has since been viewed by many Taiwanese as an anachronistic, aggravating, and humiliating term. The Taiwan Name Rectification Campaign sought to alter the formal name from &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot; to &quot;Taiwan&quot; for representation in Olympic Games and further potential international events. A nationwide referendum was held in 2018, in which a proposal for the name change was rejected. The main argument against such a move was the uncertain consequences of such a renaming; at worst, the renaming dispute could be used by China as an excuse to pressure the IOC to exclude Taiwan from participating in the Olympic Games completely and force its existing membership to be revoked. This was the case when Taiwan was stripped of the right to host the 2019 East Asian Youth Games amid its renaming issue with China during that year.

==Origins==

===Two Chinas at the Olympics===
In the aftermath of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) was established and the nationalist Republic of China (ROC) government retreated to Taiwan, previously a Qing territory that was ceded to Japanese rule from 1895 until its surrender at the end of World War II in 1945. As time went on, the increased official recognition of the PRC in international activities, such as when accorded recognition in 1971 by the United Nations, instead of that accorded previously to the ROC saw existing diplomatic relations transfer from Taipei to Beijing. The ROC needed to come to a beneficial conclusion to how it would be referred when there was participation by the PRC in the same forum.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) recognized both the PRC and the ROC Olympic Committees in 1954. In 1958, the PRC withdrew its membership from the IOC and nine other international sports organizations in protest against the two-Chinas policy. After the withdrawal of the PRC, the IOC had been using a number of names in international Olympic activities to differentiate the ROC from the PRC. &quot;Formosa&quot; was used at the 1960 Summer Olympics, and &quot;Taiwan&quot; was used in 1964 and 1968. In 1975, the PRC applied to rejoin the IOC as the sole sports organization representing the whole China. The Taiwanese team, competing under the name of Republic of China at the previous Olympics, was refused the right to represent itself as the &quot;Republic of China&quot; or use &quot;China&quot; in its name by the government of the host country, Canada, at the 1976 Summer Olympics. The IOC then voted to change the name of the ROC team to &quot;Taiwan&quot;, which was rejected by the ROC, and the ROC announced their withdrawal from the 1976 Summer Olympics a day before the opening ceremony.

The top ROC leadership at the time asserted Chinese nationalism, contending both parts of divided China are Chinese territories and Taiwan did not represent all the regions of the ROC. What people refer to as Taiwan is one of several areas or islands (Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu in addition to Taiwan) and Taiwan alone did not reflect the &quot;territorial extent&quot; of the ROC. Furthermore, although it is true that most products from the area controlled by the ROC are labeled &quot;made in Taiwan&quot;, the trade practices of the ROC are such that the regional area of production is used for labeling. Some wines from Kinmen are labeled &quot;made in Kinmen&quot;, just as some perfume are labeled &quot;made in Paris&quot; and not &quot;made in France&quot;. Therefore, the ROC government refused to accept the name of Taiwan during the period.

===1979 IOC resolutions===
In April 1979, the IOC recognized the Olympic Committee of the PRC and maintained recognition of the Olympic Committee located in Taipei at the 81st IOC Session held in Montevideo. The resolution left problems relating to the names, anthems and flags of both committees unsolved. The PRC showed a willingness to allow Taiwan to be included in the IOC but objected to the resolution, reaffirming sports organizations in Taiwan must not use any of the emblems of the Republic of China. He Zhenliang, a representative of the PRC, stated in Montevideo:
According to the Olympic Charter, only one Chinese Olympic Committee should be recognized. In consideration of the athletes in Taiwan having an opportunity to compete in the Olympic Games, the sports constitution in Taiwan could function as a local organization of China and still remain in the Olympic Movement in the name of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee. However, its anthem, flag and constitutions should be changed correspondingly.

After the 81st Session, the IOC Executive Board designated the Olympic Committee in Beijing as the Chinese Olympic Committee, with the PRC&#x27;s anthem, flag and emblem. The Olympic Committee in Taipei was designated as the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee, with a different anthem, flag and emblem from those the ROC used and which must be approved by the executive board. Lord Killanin, the president of the IOC, submitted the resolution to IOC members for a postal vote following the conclusion of the IOC Executive Board meeting held in October 1979 in Nagoya. The resolution, known as the Nagoya Resolution, was approved in November 1979 by the IOC members, and later other international sports federations adopted the resolution.

The Nagoya Resolution was welcomed by the PRC as the resolution followed the PRC&#x27;s One China principle, whereas the ROC decided that the ROC Olympic Committee must strongly protest against the decisions. From November 1979, the ROC Olympic Committee and Taiwan&#x27;s IOC member, Henry Hsu, filed a series of lawsuits in Lausanne against the IOC for annulment of the Nagoya Resolution. Taiwanese officials also boycotted the 1980 Winter and Summer Games in protest of not being allowed to use the ROC&#x27;s official name, flag and national anthem.

===1981 agreement===
In 1980, the IOC amended the Olympic Charter so that all National Olympic Committees (NOCs) when participating in the Games could use delegation flags and anthems, instead of national ones. Juan Antonio Samaranch, the new president of the IOC, met Henry Hsu several times to discuss the ROC Olympic Committee&#x27;s status in the IOC. In order for the youth to participate in the Olympic Games and counteract the PRC&#x27;s strategy of isolating the ROC, the ROC government concluded that the ROC Olympic Committee should not withdraw from the IOC.
In 1981, the ROC government formally accepted the name &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot;. A flag bearing the emblem of its Olympic Committee against a white background as the Chinese Taipei Olympic flag was confirmed in January. Based on the Olympic Charter amended at the 82nd IOC Session, an agreement was signed on 23 March in Lausanne by Juan Antonio Samaranch, the president of the IOC, and Shen Chia-ming, the president of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee (CTOC). The 1981 agreement, also known as the Lausanne Agreement, specified the name, flag and emblem of the CTOC. The CTOC is therefore entitled to be treated on the equal footing as other NOCs. In 1983, the National Flag Anthem of the Republic of China was chosen as the anthem of the Chinese Taipei delegation, and Chinese Taipei has been listed under the &quot;T&quot; group in IOC protocol order. Taiwan has competed under this name and flag exclusively at each Games since the 1984 Winter Olympics, as well as at the Paralympics and at other international events (with flags on which the Olympic rings are replaced by a symbol appropriate to the event).

==Translation compromise==
===Chinese===
Both the Republic of China (ROC) and the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) agree to use the English name &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot;. The English word &quot;Chinese&quot; is ambiguous, and may refer to either the state or the culture. The ROC translates &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot; as &quot;Zhōnghuá Táiběi&quot; (). The term &quot;Zhonghua&quot; is also used in the ROC&#x27;s official name and state-owned enterprises. Meanwhile, the PRC translates the name as &quot;Zhōngguó Táiběi&quot; () or literally &quot;Taipei, China&quot;, in the same manner as &quot;Zhōngguó Xiānggǎng&quot; () (&quot;Hong Kong, China&quot;), explicitly connoting that Taipei is a part of the Chinese state. The disagreement was left unresolved, with both governments using their own translation domestically, until just before the 1990 Asian Games where Taiwan would officially participate under the Chinese Taipei name in a Chinese-language region for the first time, forcing the need for an agreement.

In 1989, the two Olympic committees signed a pact in Hong Kong where the PRC agreed to use the ROC&#x27;s translation in international sports-related occasions hosted in China. Domestically, the PRC continues to use its own &quot;Taipei, China&quot; translation. During the 2008 Summer Olympics, Chinese state media used the agreed-upon &quot;Zhōnghuá Táiběi&quot; both internationally and in domestic press. However, during the 2020 Summer Olympics, state media began using &quot;Zhōngguó Táiběi&quot; domestically 93% of the time. During the 2022 Winter Olympics opening ceremony, China&#x27;s state media&#x27;s broadcast cut away to a clip of General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping when Taiwan&#x27;s delegation paraded as &quot;Zhōnghuá Táiběi&quot;. The broadcast in the stadium introduced the team as &quot;Zhōnghuá Táiběi&quot;, while the television broadcast commentator of China Central Television announced the delegation&#x27;s name as &quot;Zhōngguó Táiběi&quot;.

The World Health Organization, the international organization to both have Chinese as one of its official languages and have the ROC officially participate, uses &quot;Zhōnghuá Táiběi&quot; in meeting minutes when the ROC is officially invited, but uses &quot;Zhōngguó Táiběi&quot; in all other contexts.

===Other languages===

In French, multiple different names have been officially used. The World Trade Organization officially translates the name as &quot;Taipei Chinois&quot;, which has an ambiguous meaning. The text of the IOC&#x27;s Nagoya Resolution in 1979 used the name &quot;Taipei de Chine&quot; suggesting the state meaning of &quot;Chinese&quot;. Before signing the agreement between the IOC and the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee in 1981, representatives of two committees decided that the French name need not be stated. Only the English name would be used in the future IOC official documents. To this day, Chinese Taipei&#x27;s page on the French-language IOC&#x27;s website internally uses both &quot;Taipei de Chine&quot; and &quot;Taipei chinois&quot; (with a lowercase &quot;c&quot;; capitalization is not used by default for geographic origin adjectives in French) for some image alt text, but the title of the page itself simply uses the English name &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot;. When the name is announced during the Parade of Nations, the French and English announcers both repeat the identical name &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot; in English.

In East Asian languages that would normally transcribe directly from Chinese, an English transliteration is used instead to sidestep the issue. Thus Japan uses &quot;Chainīzu Taipei&quot; () while South Korea uses &quot;Chainiseu Taibei&quot; (차이니스 타이베이) for their respective-language announcements during the Olympic Games or Asian Games. Meanwhile, Vietnam mostly follows ROC&#x27;s translation and adapts the Sino-Vietnamese transcription to call Chinese Taipei as &quot;Đài Bắc Trung Hoa&quot; (alternatively &quot;Đài Bắc, Trung Hoa&quot; with a comma or &quot;Đài Bắc (Trung Hoa)&quot; with the brackets used; , ) likely due to the cosmetic and grammatical inconvenience when using direct English transliteration or the original English designation in Vietnamese context.

==Use of the name==
===International organizations and forums===

Besides the International Olympic Committee and sports organizations, Taiwan is a member economy of APEC and its official name in the organization is &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot;. Taiwan&#x27;s name in the World Trade Organization, &quot;Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu&quot;, is frequently abbreviated as Chinese Taipei. It also participated as an invited guest in the World Health Organization (WHO) under the name of Chinese Taipei. The WHO is the only agency of the United Nations that the ROC is able, provided it is invited each year, to participate in since 1971.

The terminology has spilled into apolitical arenas. The PRC has successfully pressured some international organizations and NGOs to refer to the ROC as Chinese Taipei. The International Society for Horticultural Science replaced &quot;Taiwan&quot; with &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot; in designation used for the membership. In a similar case, two Taiwanese medical groups were forced to change the word &quot;Taiwan&quot; in their membership names of ISRRT due to a request by the WHO.

In the Miss World 1998, the government of the PRC pressured the Miss World Organization to rename Miss Republic of China 1998 to &quot;Miss Chinese Taipei&quot;. The same happened in 2000, but with the Miss Universe Organization. Three years later at the Miss Universe pageant in Panama, the first official Miss China and Miss Taiwan competed alongside each other for the first time in history, prompting the PRC government to again demand that Miss Taiwan assume the title &quot;Miss Chinese Taipei&quot;. Today, neither Miss Universe nor Miss World, the two largest pageant contests in the world, allow Taiwan&#x27;s entrants to compete under the Taiwan label. In 2005, the third-largest pageant contest, Miss Earth, initially allowed Taiwanese contestant to compete as &quot;Miss Taiwan&quot;; a week into the pageant, however, the contestant&#x27;s sash was updated to &quot;Taiwan ROC&quot;. In 2008, Miss Earth changed the country&#x27;s label to Chinese Taipei.

===In Taiwan===
The name is controversial in modern Taiwan; many Taiwanese see it as a result of shameful but necessary compromise, and a symbol of oppression that mainland China forced upon them. The title &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot; has been described as confusing, as it leads some people to believe that &quot;Taipei&quot; is a country or that it is located in or governed by mainland China. Taiwanese Olympian Chi Cheng has described competing under the name as &quot;aggravating, humiliating and depressing.&quot;

Changing demographics and opinions in the country meant that more than 80% of citizens in 2016 saw themselves as Taiwanese, not Chinese, whereas in 1991, this figure was only 13.6%. This radical upswell in Taiwanese national identity has seen a re-appraisal and removal of &quot;sinocentric&quot; labels and figures established by the government during the period of Martial Law. For sporting events, the ROC team is abbreviated in Taiwan as the Team Zhonghua (). Starting around the time of the 2004 Summer Olympics, there has been a movement in Taiwan to change media references to the team to &quot;Taiwan&quot;. During the 2020 Summer Olympics, most TV channels referred to the ROC as Team Zhonghua while some channels preferred Team Taiwan ().

====2017 Summer Universiade====

Use of the label came under vigorous renewed criticism during the run-up to the 2017 Summer Universiade, hosted in Taiwan. An English-language guide to the Universiade was lambasted for its &quot;absurd&quot; use of the label. The guide was rendered nonsensically by completely avoiding the name &quot;Taiwan&quot; not only when referring to the label under which Taiwanese athletes compete, but even when referring to geographical features such as the island of Taiwan itself. These statements included &quot;Introduction of our Island: ... Chinese Taipei is long and narrow that lies north to south&quot;, and &quot;Chinese Taipei is a special island and its Capital Taipei is a great place to experience Taipei&#x27;s culture.&quot;

In response, the guide was withdrawn and shortly thereafter re-issued with the designation &quot;Taiwan&quot; reinstated. Despite these corrections, hundreds of Taiwanese demonstrated in Taipei, demanding that Taiwan cease using &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot; at sporting events.

====2018 referendum====
In February 2018, an alliance of civic organizations submitted a proposal to Taiwan&#x27;s Central Election Commission (CEC). The proposed referendum asks if the nation should apply under the name of &quot;Taiwan&quot; for all international sports events, including the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The proposal influenced the East Asian Olympic Committee (EAOC) to revoke Taichung&#x27;s right to host the first East Asian Youth Games due to &quot;political factors&quot;. An International Olympic Committee (IOC) representative reportedly said this was entirely the decision of the EAOC, and the IOC had no role in the ruling. The IOC also disapproved the altered name and sent three different warnings to the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee ahead of the referendum vote, concerning the renaming issue which may disbar Taiwan from Olympic competitions.

Taiwanese people voted during the 2018 referendum to reject the proposal to change their official Olympic-designated name from Chinese Taipei to Taiwan. The main argument for opposing the name change was worrying that Taiwan may lose its Olympic membership under Chinese pressure, which would result in athletes unable to compete in the Olympics. Another proposal for the 2024 Summer Olympics was submitted to the Taiwan&#x27;s CEC in 2021. The proposal was ultimately rejected by the CEC due to concerns that it might fall outside the scope of the Referendum Act of Taiwan, potentially rendering the Act inapplicable to the matter at hand.

==Other alternative references to Taiwan==
The terminology used to refer to the Republic of China has varied according to the geopolitical situation. Initially, the Republic of China was known simply as &quot;China&quot; until 1971, when the People&#x27;s Republic of China replaced the Republic of China as the exclusive legitimate representative of &quot;China&quot; at the United Nations. In order to distinguish the Republic of China from the People&#x27;s Republic of China, there has been a growing current of support for the use of &quot;Taiwan&quot; in place of &quot;China&quot; to refer to the former.

===Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu===
In the World Trade Organization, the official full name of Taiwan is &quot;Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu&quot;, while its official short name is &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot;. (In the same way, the official full name of the PRC is &quot;People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot;, while its official short name is &quot;China&quot;, as seen in both members&#x27; accession protocols.)

As with &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot;, the ROC and PRC also disagree on the Chinese translation of this name. The ROC uses &quot;Tái Pēng Jīn Mǎ Gèbié Guānshuì Lǐngyù&quot; (, literal translation: &quot;TPKM Separate Customs Territory&quot;), while the PRC uses &quot;Zhōngguó Táiběi Dāndú Guānshuì Qū&quot; (, literal translation: &quot;Separate Customs Territory of Taipei, China&quot;).

===Taiwan, Province of China===

International organizations in which the PRC participates generally do not recognize Taiwan or allow its membership. Thus, for example, whenever the United Nations makes reference to Taiwan, which does not appear on its member countries list, it uses the designation &quot;Taiwan, Province of China&quot;, and organizations that follow UN standards usually do the same, such as the International Organization for Standardization in its listing of ISO 3166-1 country codes. Certain web-based postal address programs also label the country designation name for Taiwan as &quot;Taiwan, Province of China&quot;.

Taiwan&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs objected to the term together with other names including &quot;Taiwan, China&quot;, &quot;Taipei, China&quot; and &quot;Chinese Taiwan&quot; in guidelines issued in 2018.

===Island of Taiwan/Formosa===
The term island of Taiwan or Formosa is used sometimes to avoid any misunderstanding about the Taiwan independence movement just referring to the island.

===China or Republic of China===
Some non-governmental organizations which the PRC does not participate in continue to use &quot;China&quot; or the &quot;Republic of China&quot;. The World Organization of the Scout Movement is one of the few international organizations that continue to use the name of &quot;Republic of China&quot;, and the ROC affiliate as the Scouts of China. This is because Scouting in mainland China is very limited or not really active. Likewise, Freemasonry is outlawed in the PRC and thus the Grand Lodge of China is based in Taiwan.

===Governing authorities on Taiwan===
The United States uses the term &quot;governing authorities on Taiwan&quot; in the Taiwan Relations Act, officially defining the term &quot;Taiwan&quot; to &quot;include...the islands of Taiwan and the Pescadores...and the governing authorities on Taiwan recognized by the United States as the Republic of China prior to January 1, 1979.&quot; Geographically and following the similar content in the earlier defense treaty from 1955, it excludes the other islands or archipelagos under the control of the Republic of China, such as Kinmen and the Matsu Islands.

===Other non-specified areas===
The United Nations publishes population projections for each nation, with nations grouped under geographic area; in 2015, the East Asia group contained an entry named &quot;Other non-specified areas&quot; referring to Taiwan. However, the 2017 publication updated the entry&#x27;s name to the UN&#x27;s preferred &quot;Taiwan, Province of China&quot;.

<text>Histriomastix: The Player&#x27;s Scourge, or Actor&#x27;s Tragedy published in 1632 is a critique of professional theatre and actors, written by the Puritan author and controversialist William Prynne.

==Publication==
While the publishing history of the work is not absolutely clear, &quot;Histriomastix&quot; was published late in 1632 by the bookseller Michael Sparke. It had been in preparation by its author for almost ten years before its printing.

The title page of the first edition is erroneously dated 1633; as a result many sources cite this as the date of publication. Depositions given in connection with Prynne&#x27;s trial indicate that the actual writing of the text was accomplished between spring 1631 and mid-to-late 1632.

==Themes==
&quot;Histriomastix&quot; represents the culmination of the Puritan attack on the English Renaissance theatre and celebrations such as Christmas, as noted in the following: &quot;Our Christmas lords of misrule, together with dancing, masks, mummeries, state players, and such other Christmas disorders, now in use with Christians, were derived from these Roman Saturnalia and Bacchanalian festivals, which should cause all pious Christians eternally to abominate them.&quot;

Running to over a thousand pages, and with a main title of 43 lines, &quot;Histriomastix&quot; marshals a multitude of ancient and medieval authorities against the &quot;sin&quot; of dramatic performance. The book condemns most aspects of dramatic performance in its era, from the practice of boy actors representing women to the &quot;obscene lascivious love songs, most melodiously chanted out upon the stage...&quot;

==Theological and political context==
Prynne&#x27;s book was not by any means the first such attack on the stage, though it certainly was the longest. Its Puritan theology was in any case unwelcome to the civil authorities, led by Attorney General William Noy.

==Trial and sentence==
Prynne was imprisoned in 1633 but not tried until 1634, at which time he had to appear before the Star Chamber on a charge of seditious libel. Prosecuted by the barrister William Hudson on behalf of Noy, he was defended by Edward Atkyns and John Herne. Sentence on Prynne was pronounced by Lord Cottington, and the other judges (Sir John Coke, Robert Heath, the Earl of Pembroke, and Sir Thomas Richardson) concurred.

At Prynne&#x27;s trial, some fifty separate and allegedly seditious excerpts from the book were quoted; but the one that has attracted most attention from subsequent critics is Prynne&#x27;s attack on women actors as &quot;notorious whores.&quot; Though Prynne&#x27;s text made clear he was referring to French actresses who had recently performed at Blackfriars, the remark was, at the time, taken as a direct reference to Queen Henrietta Maria. The Queen had had a speaking role in Walter Montagu&#x27;s masque &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Paradise,&quot; which was staged on January 9, 1633, most likely after Prynne&#x27;s book was in print, but she had also appeared and danced in two earlier masques and performed a spoken part in French in a private performance of Honorat de Racan&#x27;s pastoral, &quot;Artenice,&quot; in 1626.

In the end, Prynne was sentenced to be pilloried twice, fined £5,000, and imprisoned for life. In addition, his book was to be burned by the common hangman, and he was expelled from his university, prohibited from practicing law, and mutilated by the severance of his ears. During his imprisonment, Prynne continued to produce anonymous pamphlets attacking leaders of the Anglican Church, which induced the authorities, in 1637, to inflict further mutilation: first, the surviving stumps of his severed ears were cut off, and, second, his cheeks were branded with the letters “S.L.” The letters represented the words “Seditious Libeler,” but since his biting words sometimes attacked Archbishop Laud, Prynne preferred to render them as “Stigmata Laudis,” or, “the marks of Laud.”

==Purported retraction==
Not long before the execution of Charles I, which occurred on 30 January 1649, a tract began to circulate, datelined &quot;London, printed in the year 1649,&quot; and bearing the title &quot;Mr. William Prynn His Defence of Stage Plays in a Retractation of a former Book of his called Histrio-Mastix&quot;. Written in Prynne’s style and under his name, the text purported to be a retraction of the sentiments expressed in &quot;Histriomastix&quot;. Prynne responded with a “posting-bill,” or flyer, of his own under the title “Vindication,” which bore the date January 10, 1648, oddly a full year before the publication of the alleged retraction. In 1825, the antiquarian E. W. Brayley undertook to expose the “retraction” as a hoax in a slim volume entitled &quot;An Enquiry into the Genuineness of Prynne’s “Defense of Stage Plays,”&quot; and his argument addresses, in part, the anomaly of the dates by explaining the slow acceptance of the calendar reforms of 1582.

==Aftermath==
Prynne was released from prison during the Long Parliament. The notorious book was never fully suppressed; however, in the next generation, even King Charles II had a copy in his library.

<text>The Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MIAA) is an intercollegiate athletic conference that competes in the NCAA&#x27;s Division III. There are nine teams in the conference, all located in the states of Michigan and Indiana. The Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association was established on March 24, 1888, making it the oldest college athletic conference in the United States. The current members of the MIAA include Adrian College, Albion College, Alma College, Calvin University, Hope College, Kalamazoo College, University of Olivet, Saint Mary&#x27;s College of Notre Dame, Indiana, and Trine University, formerly known as Tri-State University. Olivet, Alma and Albion are the only charter members remaining in the conference. Former members include such colleges as Michigan State University, previously Michigan Agricultural College, (1888–1907), Eastern Michigan University, previously Michigan State Normal College, (1892–1926), Hillsdale College (1888–1961), and Defiance College (1997–2000).

The members of the MIAA were unchanged from 1961 until 1997 when Defiance College of Ohio and Saint Mary&#x27;s College of Indiana were invited to join. Defiance College and Saint Mary&#x27;s College of Indiana were the first colleges from outside of Michigan to be admitted to the conference. Adrian, Albion, Alma, Calvin, Hope, Kalamazoo, Olivet and Saint Mary&#x27;s have not been members of any other conference. In 2002, the league accepted Wisconsin Lutheran College as an associate member for the purpose of competing only in football. Wisconsin Lutheran College left the MIAA for another conference in 2007. The newest member of the MIAA was accepted in the 2004–05 season, Tri-State University. Tri-State University changed their name to Trine University in 2008.

==History==
The MIAA conference was established on March 24, 1888, and is the oldest collegiate athletic conference in the United States. The conference includes 23 different sports, 12 being men&#x27;s and 11 being women&#x27;s. The number of sports with competition is 23 (12 men and 11 women sports). These sports include cross country, football, golf, basketball, tennis, swimming, baseball, volleyball, softball, indoor track and field, outdoor track and field, lacrosse, soccer, and men&#x27;s wrestling. Some past sports that are no longer in competition include bicycle racing, Indian club juggling, archery, and field hockey.

The &quot;Father&quot; of the MIAA, was James Heckman of Hillsdale. Heckman promoted the idea of a permanent league after several schools had sponsored successful track and field days from 1884 to 1887. The first delegates met in Jackson on March 17, 1888, to organize the MIAA. A week after the meeting delegates from Albion, Hillsdale, Michigan State and Olivet drew up the MIAA&#x27;s first constitution.

The schools that were to be a part of the MIAA in 1888 had diverse enrollment numbers. The largest enrollment belonged to Eastern with 714. Albion was listed as 451, Hillsdale 450, Michigan State 314, Olivet 277, Adrian 150, Hope 148, Kalamazoo 143 and Alma with 95 students. Some of the enrollment figures included many students taking work on a high school level. This meant that athletic teams of those years included both high school and college students. A five or six-year career of athletic participation was not unusual at that time.

On May 31, June 1–2, 1888 the first MIAA track and field meet was held at East Lansing, not even three months after the original meeting. The events that were held included the 100- yard dash, 200-yard dash, 880- yard run, high jump, long jump, shot put, hammer throw and mile relay. Some other events that would not normally be at a track and field meet today, were lawn tennis, wrestling, Indian club swing, horizontal and parallel bar performing, bicycle racing, sparring, and tug-of-war. The teams that competed in this event were Hillsdale, Albion, Michigan State, and Olivet. Hillsdale was the first MIAA track champion.

The following year in 1889, the second annual MIAA Field Day was done. At this Field Day Albion and Olivet participated in an exhibition &quot;football match&quot;. It was not until 1891 when the first official intercollegiate football game in the MIAA was played with Albion defeating Hillsdale 36–4. Football was not recognized until 1894 as an official league sport.

The following sports came into effect as follows: Baseball, the 440-yard dash, mile run, high hurdles and pole vault in 1889. Football was recognized as an official league sport in 1894. The two mile run and discus in 1912 and the javelin replaced the hammer throw in 1913. Basketball became a league sport in 1911. Cross country was introduced in 1922 while golf was in 1934. Wrestling was introduced in 1969, but then was dropped in 1981. Soccer in 1970 and swimming in 1971.

Contrary to what many would think that sports for women only started in 1978-79 there is evidence that it started much earlier than that. The first Albion college tennis tournament held six years after the league was formed was actually a co-ed event. In 1936, Albion invited all of the MIAA schools to a play day and convention which was the first attempt to organize a women&#x27;s athletic program for the MIAA. 100 women from all of the colleges in the MIAA participated in events such as archery, tennis, volleyball, basketball, badminton, softball, and swimming. In 1941 the Athletic Federation of Michigan College Women (AFMCW) was established. It later became known as the Women&#x27;s Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association (WMIAA) in 1946.

In 1977 league presidents voted to allow post-season participation by member schools if they were so invited by the NCAA Division III Football Committee (Harburn 4). This ended a seventeen-year ban on post-season competition. Albion&#x27;s 1977 team was the first team chosen to participate. Many teams during the ban did not have the chance to show off their skills as some teams were even ranked in the Top Ten nationally, because of the NCAA rule prohibiting more than two teams from the same region being selected (Harburn 4). Hillsdale College left the conference in 1960 because they accepted a bid to a postseason football bowl game and were subsequently suspended two years by the conference.

In 1978–79, the league combined into a single structure the administration of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s athletic programs of the member schools. This meant that women sports would be included.

==Winning streaks and distinguished coaches==
The MIAA has had its share of many winning seasons, but there are some that may stick out more than others. For example, Kalamazoo College men&#x27;s tennis has been a part of one that cannot be matched by any other college or university in America. They have won or shared every MIAA Finals championship since 1936, which is 72 consecutive titles (www.miaa.org accessed 5/2/10). The only times they had to share the title was with Hope College in 1962 and 2003. Some other notable championship streaks include Calvin&#x27;s men cross country 33 years in a row (active); Calvin&#x27;s women track &amp; field 27 years in a row.

Since 1990, MIAA member colleges have won 18 National Division III championships. The first MIAA national championship was won by Kalamazoo in 1976 when it won the men&#x27;s tennis championship (Renner 19). The Kalamazoo College Hornets would later win back-to-back championships in 1986 and 1987 (Renner 19) and again in 1991, 1992, and 1993. NCAA Division III history was made in 1991-92 when the MIAA claimed two national championships in basketball with Calvin winning the men&#x27;s title and Alma with the women&#x27;s. The league has had 82 individual NCAA national championship performances since 1978.

The league has had many coaches throughout its history. There are always some coaches that stand out from the rest. One coach that stands out from the rest is George Acker of Kalamazoo College. Acker was a Phys. Ed Professor and men&#x27;s tennis coach for 35 years. His impressive resume includes coaching 7 NCAA Division III Championships and 35 MIAA Championships. An impressive 209-1 MIAA career dual-meet record and an overall 537–231 record (www.kzoo.edu/sports/ahof/sport.html accessed October 15, 2008). Acker was the winningest coach in the MIAA. He is followed by John Patnott of Hope College, Tish Loveless (Kalamazoo College), Chester Barnard (Kalamazoo College), and Bob Kent also from Kalamazoo College.

Another such coach was Jare T. Klein of Olivet. As coach of the famed Olivet College wrestling program, Olivet teams won 10 league championships (including 9 straight) in 15 seasons. His team&#x27;s overall dual meet record during his 29-year coaching tenure was 569 - 119. It appears that Klein may have been a victim to his own success as the MIAA dropped wrestling as a league sport in 1984.

==Rivalries==
Of course a league will have many rivalries and the MIAA is no different. In an interview with Jamie Zorbo, head football coach for Kalamazoo College, talked about the tradition of the MIAA and the rivalries. &quot;It is a competitive league; all the teams that are competing have been for a long time and have a lot of history to play for... Great rivalries are made including Kalamazoo vs. Hope; Albion vs. Kalamazoo and the Calvin vs. Hope rivalry in basketball. These are just a few of them.&quot; (Zorbo, Jamie. Personal Interview, October 15, 2008).

The Calvin vs. Hope rivalry has actually made national news. ESPN recently identified the nation&#x27;s greatest college basketball rivalries. Calvin–Hope rivalry tops the Division III and is ranked fourth in all college hoops. ESPN covered this game in 2005 and a &quot;fan poll&quot; was conducted after the game where 80% of the voters voted for Calvin-Hope as number one. It was also covered in July 2007 in an ESPN series (http://www.hope.edu/pr/athletics/therivalry/index.html accessed October 15, 2008).

<doc id="261899" wikidata="Q310491" url="?curid=261899" title="Entheogen">
<text>Entheogens are psychoactive substances, including psychedelic drugs (such as magic mushrooms) used throughout history in sacred contexts. 

Entheogens have been used in various ways, including as part of established religious rituals and as aids for personal spiritual development. Anthropological study has established that entheogens are used for religious, magical, shamanic, or spiritual purposes in many parts of the world. They have traditionally been used to supplement many diverse practices geared towards achieving transcendence, including healing, divination, meditation, yoga, sensory deprivation, asceticism, prayer, trance, rituals, chanting, imitation of sounds, hymns like peyote songs, drumming, and ecstatic dance. 

The psychedelic experience is often compared to non-ordinary forms of consciousness such as those experienced in meditation, near-death experiences, and mystical experiences. Ego dissolution is often described as a key feature of the psychedelic experience.

==Terminology==
The neologism &quot;entheogen&quot; was coined in 1979 by a group of ethnobotanists and scholars of mythology (Carl A. P. Ruck, Jeremy Bigwood, Danny Staples, Richard Evans Schultes, Jonathan Ott and R. Gordon Wasson). The term is derived from two words of Ancient Greek, () and (). The adjective translates to English as &quot;full of the god, inspired, possessed&quot;, and is the root of the English word &quot;enthusiasm&quot;. The Greeks used it as praise for poets and other artists. means &quot;to come into being&quot;. Thus, an entheogen is a drug that causes one to become inspired or to experience feelings of inspiration, often in a religious or &quot;spiritual&quot; manner.

Ruck et al. argued that the term &quot;hallucinogen&quot; was inappropriate owing to its etymological relationship to words relating to delirium and insanity. The term &quot;psychedelic&quot; was also seen as problematic, owing to the similarity in sound to words about psychosis and also because it had become irreversibly associated with various connotations of the 1960s pop culture. In modern usage, &quot;entheogen&quot; may be used synonymously with these terms, or it may be chosen to contrast with recreational use of the same drugs. The meanings of the term &quot;entheogen&quot; was formally defined by Ruck et al.:

In 2004, David E. Nichols wrote the following:

==History==


Entheogens have been used by different people groups for thousands of years. R. Gordon Wasson and Giorgio Samorini have proposed several examples of the cultural use of entheogens that are found in the archaeological record. Hemp seeds discovered by archaeologists at Pazyryk suggest early ceremonial practices by the Scythians occurred during the 5th to 2nd century BCE, confirming previous historical reports by Herodotus.

Most of the well-known modern examples of entheogens, such as Ayahuasca, peyote, psilocybin mushrooms, and morning glories are from the native cultures of the Americas. However, it has also been suggested that entheogens played an important role in ancient Indo-European culture, for example by inclusion in the ritual preparations of the Soma, the &quot;pressed juice&quot; that is the subject of Book 9 of the &quot;Rigveda&quot;. Soma was ritually prepared and drunk by priests and initiates and elicited a paean in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; that embodies the nature of an entheogen:

The kykeon that preceded initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries is another entheogen, which was investigated (before the word was coined) by Carl Kerényi, in &quot;Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter.&quot; Other entheogens in the Ancient Near East and the Aegean include the opium poppy, datura, and the unidentified &quot;lotus&quot; (likely the sacred blue lily) eaten by the Lotus-Eaters in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Narcissus&quot;.

According to Ruck, Eyan, and Staples, the familiar shamanic entheogen that the Indo-Europeans brought knowledge of was &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot;. It could not be cultivated; thus it had to be found, which suited it to a nomadic lifestyle. When they reached the world of the Caucasus and the Aegean, the Indo-Europeans encountered wine, the entheogen of Dionysus, who brought it with him from his birthplace in the mythical Nysa, when he returned to claim his Olympian birthright. The Indo-European proto-Greeks &quot;recognized it as the entheogen of Zeus, and their own traditions of shamanism, the Amanita and the &#x27;pressed juice&#x27; of Somabut better, since no longer unpredictable and wild, the way it was found among the Hyperboreans: as befit their own assimilation of agrarian modes of life, the entheogen was now cultivable.&quot; Robert Graves, in his foreword to &quot;The Greek Myths,&quot; hypothesises that the ambrosia of various pre-Hellenic tribes was &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; (which, based on the morphological similarity of the words amanita, amrita and ambrosia, is entirely plausible) and perhaps psilocybin mushrooms of the genus &quot;Panaeolus&quot;. &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; was regarded as divine food, according to Ruck and Staples, not something to be indulged in, sampled lightly, or profaned. It was seen as the food of the gods, their ambrosia, and as mediating between the two realms. It is said that Tantalus&#x27;s crime was inviting commoners to share his ambrosia.

== By region ==
=== Africa ===

The best-known entheogen-using culture of Africa is the Bwitists, who used a preparation of the root bark of &quot;Tabernanthe iboga&quot;. Although the ancient Egyptians may have been using the sacred blue lily plant in some of their religious rituals or just symbolically, it has been suggested that Egyptian religion once revolved around the ritualistic ingestion of the far more psychoactive &quot;Psilocybe cubensis&quot; mushroom, and that the Egyptian White Crown, Triple Crown, and Atef Crown were evidently designed to represent pin-stages of this mushroom. There is also evidence for the use of psilocybin mushrooms in Ivory Coast. Numerous other plants used in shamanic ritual in Africa, such as &quot;Silene capensis&quot; sacred to the Xhosa, are yet to be investigated by western science. A recent revitalization has occurred in the study of southern African psychoactives and entheogens (Mitchell and Hudson 2004; Sobiecki 2002, 2008, 2012).

Among the amaXhosa, the artificial drug 2C-B is used as entheogen by traditional healers or amagqirha over their traditional plants; they refer to the chemical as &quot;Ubulawu Nomathotholo&quot;, which roughly translates to &quot;Medicine of the Singing Ancestors&quot;.

==== East Africa ====
For centuries, religious leaders have consumed the khat leaves to stay awake during long nights of prayer.

=== Americas ===

Entheogens have played a pivotal role in the spiritual practices of most American cultures for millennia. The first American entheogen to be subject to scientific analysis was the peyote cactus (&quot;Lophophora williamsii&quot;). One of the founders of modern ethno-botany, Richard Evans Schultes of Harvard University documented the ritual use of peyote cactus among the Kiowa, who live in what became Oklahoma. While it was used traditionally by many cultures of what is now Mexico, in the 19th century its use spread throughout North America, replacing the toxic mescal bean (&quot;Calia secundiflora&quot;). Other well-known entheogens used by Mexican cultures include the alcoholic Aztec sacrament pulque, ritual tobacco (known as &#x27;picietl&#x27; to the Aztecs, and &#x27;sikar&#x27; to the Maya (from where the word &#x27;cigar&#x27; derives)), psilocybin mushrooms, morning glories (&quot;Ipomoea tricolor&quot; and &quot;Turbina corymbosa&quot;), and &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot;.

&quot;Datura wrightii&quot; is sacred to some Native Americans and has been used in ceremonies and rites of passage by Chumash, Tongva, and others. Among the Chumash, when a boy was 8 years old, his mother would give him a preparation of &quot;momoy&quot; to drink. This supposed spiritual challenge should help the boy develop the spiritual wellbeing that is required to become a man. Not all of the boys undergoing this ritual survived. &quot;Momoy&quot; was also used to enhance spiritual wellbeing among adults. For instance, during a frightening situation, such as when seeing a coyote walk like a man, a leaf of &quot;momoy&quot; was sucked to help keep the soul in the body.

The mescal bean &quot;Sophora secundiflora&quot; was used by the shamanic hunter-gatherer cultures of the Great Plains region. Other plants with ritual significance in North American shamanism are the hallucinogenic seeds of the Texas buckeye and jimsonweed (&quot;Datura stramonium&quot;). Paleoethnobotanical evidence for these plants from archaeological sites shows they were used in ancient times thousands of years ago.

==== South America ====
The Tairona people of Colombia&#x27;s Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta chewed the coca plant before engaging in extended meditation and prayer.

Nicotiana rustica is used in the Amazon by Mapacho, and tobacco shamans known as tobaqueros.

A ritual use by the Quechua people involves drinking guayusa infusion to have foretelling dreams for successful hunting expeditions.

&quot;Trichocereus macrogonus&quot; var. &quot;pachanoi&quot; has a long history of being used in Andean traditional medicine. Archaeological studies have found evidence of use going back two thousand years, to Moche culture, Nazca culture, and Chavín culture. In 2022, the Peruvian Ministry of Culture declared the traditional use of San Pedro cactus in northern Peru as cultural heritage.

=== Asia ===

The indigenous peoples of Siberia (from whom the term &quot;shaman&quot; was borrowed) have used &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; as an entheogen.

In Hinduism, &quot;Datura stramonium&quot; and cannabis have been used in religious ceremonies, although the religious use of datura is not very common, as the primary alkaloids are strong deliriants, which causes serious intoxication with unpredictable effects.

Also, the ancient drink Soma, mentioned often in the Vedas, appears to be consistent with the effects of an entheogen. In his 1967 book, Wasson argues that Soma was &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot;. The active ingredient of Soma is presumed by some to be ephedrine, an alkaloid with stimulant properties derived from the soma plant, identified as &quot;Ephedra pachyclada&quot;. However, there are also arguments about the botanical identity of soma–haoma suggesting it could have also been Syrian rue, cannabis, &quot;Atropa belladonna&quot;, or some combination of any of the above plants.

==== West Asia ====
The earliest credible evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century, in Yemen&#x27;s Sufi monasteries. The Sufi monks drank coffee as an aid to concentration and even spiritual intoxication when they chanted the name of God.

=== Europe ===

Fermented honey, known in Northern Europe as mead, was an early entheogen in Aegean civilization, predating the introduction of wine, which was the more familiar entheogen of the reborn Dionysus and the maenads. Its religious uses in the Aegean world are intertwined with the mythology of the bee.

Dacians were known to use cannabis in their religious and important life ceremonies, proven by discoveries of large clay pots with burnt cannabis seeds in ancient tombs and religious shrines. Also, local oral folklore and myths tell of ancient priests that dreamed with gods and walked in the smoke. Their names, as transmitted by Herodotus, were &quot;kap-no-batai&quot; which in Dacian was supposed to mean &quot;the ones that walk in the clouds&quot;.

The growth of Roman Christianity also saw the end of the two-thousand-year-old tradition of the Eleusinian Mysteries, the initiation ceremony for the cult of Demeter and Persephone involving the use of a drug known as kykeon. The term &#x27;ambrosia&#x27; is used in Greek mythology in a way that is remarkably similar to the &quot;Soma&quot; of the Hindus as well.

A theory that naturally-occurring gases like ethylene used by inhalation may have played a role in divinatory ceremonies at Delphi in Classical Greece received popular press attention in the early 2000s, yet has not been conclusively proven.

Mushroom consumption is part of the culture of Europeans in general, with particular importance to Slavic and Baltic peoples. Some academics argue that the use of psilocybin- and/or muscimol-containing mushrooms was an integral part of the ancient culture of the Rus&#x27; people.

=== Middle East ===

It has been suggested that the ritual use of small amounts of Syrian rue is an artifact of its ancient use in higher doses as an entheogen (possibly in conjunction with DMT-containing acacia).

John Marco Allegro argued that early Jewish and Christian cultic practice was based on the use of &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot;, which was later forgotten by its adherents, but this view has been widely disputed.

=== Oceania ===
In general, indigenous Australians are thought not to have used entheogens, although there is a strong barrier of secrecy surrounding Aboriginal shamanism, which has likely limited what has been told to outsiders.
Kava or &quot;kava kava&quot; (&quot;Piper Methysticum&quot;) has been cultivated for at least 3,000 years by a number of Pacific island-dwelling peoples. Historically, most Polynesian, many Melanesian, and some Micronesian cultures have ingested the psychoactive pulverized root, typically taking it mixed with water. In these traditions, taking kava is believed to facilitate contact with the spirits of the dead, especially relatives and ancestors.

There are no known uses of entheogens by the Māori of New Zealand aside from a variant species of kava, although some modern scholars have claimed that there may be evidence of psilocybin mushroom use. Natives of Papua New Guinea are known to use several species of entheogenic mushrooms (&quot;Psilocybe&quot; spp, &quot;Boletus manicus&quot;).

Pituri, also known as mingkulpa, is a mixture of leaves and wood ash traditionally chewed as a stimulant (or, after extended use, a depressant) by Aboriginal Australians widely across the continent. Leaves are gathered from any of several species of native tobacco (&quot;Nicotiana&quot;) or from at least one distinct population of the species &quot;Duboisia hopwoodii&quot;. Various species of &quot;Acacia&quot;, &quot;Grevillea&quot; and &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; are burned to produce the ash. The term &quot;pituri&quot; may also refer to the plants from which the leaves are gathered or from which the ash is made. Some authors use the term to refer only to the plant &quot;Duboisia hopwoodii&quot; and its leaves and any chewing mixture containing its leaves.

== In religion ==

Shamans all over the world and in different cultures have traditionally used drugs, especially psychedelics, for their religious experiences. In these communities the absorption of drugs leads to dreams (visions) through sensory distortion. The psychedelic experience is often compared to non-ordinary forms of consciousness such as those experienced in meditation, and mystical experiences. Ego dissolution is often described as a key feature of the psychedelic experience.

Entheogens used in the contemporary world include biota like peyote (Native American Church), extracts like ayahuasca (Santo Daime, União do Vegetal).

Entheogens also play an important role in contemporary religious movements such as the Rastafari movement.

=== Hinduism ===
Bhang is an edible preparation of cannabis native to the Indian subcontinent. It has been used in food and drink as early as 1000 BCE by Hindus in ancient India.
The earliest known reports regarding the sacred status of cannabis in the Indian subcontinent come from the Atharva Veda estimated to have been written sometime around 2000–1400 BCE, which mentions cannabis as one of the &quot;five sacred plants... which release us from anxiety&quot; and that a guardian angel resides in its leaves. The Vedas also refer to it as a &quot;source of happiness&quot;, &quot;joy-giver&quot; and &quot;liberator&quot;, and in the &quot;Raja Valabba&quot;, the gods send hemp to the human race.

=== Buddhism ===
It has been suggested that the &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; mushroom was used by the Tantric Buddhist mahasiddha tradition of the 8th to 12th century.

In the West, some modern Buddhist teachers have written on the usefulness of psychedelics. The Buddhist magazine &quot;&quot; devoted their entire fall 1996 edition to this issue. Some teachers such as Jack Kornfield have suggested the possibility that psychedelics could complement Buddhist practice, bring healing and help people understand their connection with everything which could lead to compassion. Kornfield warns however that addiction can still be a hindrance. Other teachers such as Michelle McDonald-Smith expressed views which saw entheogens as not conducive to Buddhist practice (&quot;I don&#x27;t see them developing anything&quot;).

=== Judaism ===

The primary advocate of the religious use of cannabis in early Judaism was Polish anthropologist Sula Benet, who claimed that the plant &quot;kaneh bosem קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם&quot; mentioned five times in the Hebrew Bible, and used in the holy anointing oil of the Book of Exodus, was cannabis. According to theories that hold that cannabis was present in Ancient Israelite society, a variant of hashish is held to have been present. In 2020, it was announced that cannabis residue had been found on the Israelite sanctuary altar at Tel Arad dating to the 8th century BCE of the Kingdom of Judah, suggesting that cannabis was a part of some Israelite rituals at the time.

While Benet&#x27;s conclusion regarding the psychoactive use of cannabis is not universally accepted among Jewish scholars, there is general agreement that cannabis is used in talmudic sources to refer to hemp fibers, not hashish, as hemp was a vital commodity before linen replaced it. Lexicons of Hebrew and dictionaries of plants of the Bible such as by Michael Zohary (1985), Hans Arne Jensen (2004) and James A. Duke (2010) and others identify the plant in question as either &quot;Acorus calamus&quot; or &quot;Cymbopogon citratus&quot;, not cannabis.

=== Christianity ===

Scholars such as Ammon Hillman suggest that a variety of drug use, recreational and otherwise, is to be found in the early history of the Church.

The historical picture portrayed by the &quot;Entheos&quot; journal is of fairly widespread use of visionary plants in early Christianity and the surrounding culture, with a gradual reduction of use of entheogens in Christianity. R. Gordon Wasson&#x27;s book &quot;Soma&quot; prints a letter from art historian Erwin Panofsky asserting that art scholars are aware of many &quot;mushroom trees&quot; in Christian art.

The question of the extent of visionary plant use throughout the history of Christian practice has barely been considered yet by academic or independent scholars. The question of whether visionary plants were used in pre-Theodosian Christianity is distinct from evidence that indicates the extent to which visionary plants were utilized or forgotten in later Christianity, including heretical or quasi-Christian groups, and the question of other groups such as elites or laity within orthodox Catholic practice.

=== Peyotism ===
The Native American Church (NAC) is also known as &quot;Peyotism&quot; and &quot;Peyote Religion&quot;. Peyotism is a Native American religion characterized by mixed traditional as well as Protestant beliefs and by sacramental use of the entheogen peyote.

The Peyote Way Church of God believe that &quot;Peyote is a holy sacrament, when taken according to our sacramental procedure and combined with a holistic lifestyle&quot;.

===Santo Daime===
Santo Daime is a syncretic religion founded in the 1930s in the Brazilian Amazonian state of Acre by Raimundo Irineu Serra, known as Mestre Irineu. Santo Daime incorporates elements of several religious or spiritual traditions including Folk Catholicism, Kardecist Spiritism, African animism and indigenous South American shamanism, including &quot;vegetalismo&quot;.

Ceremonies – &quot;trabalhos&quot; (Brazilian Portuguese for &quot;works&quot;) – are typically several hours long and are undertaken sitting in silent &quot;concentration&quot;, or sung collectively, dancing according to simple steps in geometrical formation. Ayahuasca, referred to as Daime within the practice, which contains several psychoactive compounds, is drunk as part of the ceremony. The drinking of Daime can induce a strong emetic effect which is embraced as both emotional and physical purging.

===União do Vegetal===
União do Vegetal (UDV) is a religious society founded on July 22, 1961, by José Gabriel da Costa, known as Mestre Gabriel. The translation of &quot;União do Vegetal&quot; is &quot;Union of the Plants&quot; referring to the sacrament of the UDV, Hoasca tea (also known as ayahuasca). This beverage is made by boiling two plants, Mariri (&quot;Banisteriopsis caapi&quot;) and Chacrona (&quot;Psychotria viridis&quot;), both of which are native to the Amazon rainforest.

In its sessions, UDV members drink Hoasca Tea for the effect of mental concentration. In Brazil, the use of Hoasca in religious rituals was regulated by the Brazilian Federal Government&#x27;s National Drug Policy Council on January 25, 2010. The policy established legal norms for the religious institutions that responsibly use this tea. The Supreme Court of the United States unanimously affirmed the UDV&#x27;s right to use Hoasca tea in its religious sessions in the United States, in a decision published on February 21, 2006.

===Thelema===
The Thelema ceremony calls for five officers: a Priest, a Priestess, a Deacon, and two adult acolytes, called &quot;the Children&quot;. The end of the ritual culminates in the consummation of the eucharist, consisting of a goblet of wine and a Cake of Light, after which the congregant proclaims &quot;There is no part of me that is not of the gods!&quot;

== Research ==

Notable early testing of the entheogenic experience includes the Marsh Chapel Experiment, conducted by physician and theology doctoral candidate Walter Pahnke under the supervision of psychologist Timothy Leary and the Harvard Psilocybin Project. In this double-blind experiment, volunteer graduate school divinity students from the Boston area almost all claimed to have had profound religious experiences subsequent to the ingestion of pure psilocybin.

Beginning in 2006, experiments have been conducted at Johns Hopkins University, showing that under controlled conditions psilocybin causes mystical experiences in most participants and that they rank the personal and spiritual meaningfulness of the experiences very highly.

Except in Mexico, research with psychedelics is limited due to ongoing widespread drug prohibition. The amount of peer-reviewed research on psychedelics has accordingly been limited due to the difficulty of getting approval from institutional review boards. Furthermore, scientific studies on entheogens present some significant challenges to researchers, including philosophical questions relating to ontology, epistemology and objectivity.

== Legal status ==

===By entheogen===
* Psychoactive &quot;Amanita&quot; mushrooms: Legal status of psychoactive &quot;Amanita&quot; mushrooms
* Ayuahuasca: Legal status of ayahuasca by country
* Psychoactive cactus: Legal status of psychoactive cactus by country
* Cannabis: Legality of cannabis ()
* Ibogaine: Legal status of ibogaine by country
* Psilocybin mushrooms: Legal status of psilocybin mushrooms
* &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot;: Legal status of Salvia divinorum

===By country or territory===

Some countries have legislation that allows for traditional entheogen use.

====United Nations====
====Australia====
Between 2011 and 2012, the Australian Federal Government was considering changes to the Australian Criminal Code that would classify any plants containing any amount of DMT as &quot;controlled plants&quot;. DMT itself was already controlled under current laws. The proposed changes included other similar blanket bans for other substances, such as a ban on any and all plants containing mescaline or ephedrine. The proposal was not pursued after political embarrassment on realisation that this would make the official Floral Emblem of Australia, &quot;Acacia pycnantha&quot; (golden wattle), illegal. The Therapeutic Goods Administration and federal authority had considered a motion to ban the same, but this was withdrawn in May 2012 (as DMT may still hold potential entheogenic value to native or religious peoples).

==== United States ====
In 1963 in &quot;Sherbert v. Verner&quot; the Supreme Court established the Sherbert Test, which consists of four criteria that are used to determine if an individual&#x27;s right to religious free exercise has been violated by the government. The test is as follows:

For the individual, the court must determine
* whether the person has a claim involving a sincere religious belief, and
* whether the government action is a substantial burden on the person&#x27;s ability to act on that belief.

If these two elements are established, then the government must prove
* that it is acting in furtherance of a &quot;compelling state interest&quot;, and
* that it has pursued that interest in the manner least restrictive, or least burdensome, to religion.

This test was eventually all-but-eliminated in &quot;Employment Division v. Smith&quot; 494 U.S. 872 (1990) which held that a &quot;neutral law of general applicability&quot; was not subject to the test. Congress resurrected it for the purposes of federal law in the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993.

In &quot;City of Boerne v. Flores&quot;, 521 U.S. 507 (1997) RFRA was held to trespass on state sovereignty, and application of the RFRA was essentially limited to federal law enforcement. In &quot;Gonzales v. O Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal&quot;, 546 U.S. 418 (2006), a case involving only federal law, RFRA was held to permit a church&#x27;s use of a DMT-containing tea for religious ceremonies.

Some states have enacted State Religious Freedom Restoration Acts intended to mirror the federal RFRA&#x27;s protections.

Peyote is listed by the United States DEA as a Schedule I controlled substance. However, practitioners of the Peyote Way Church of God, a Native American religion, perceive the regulations regarding the use of peyote as discriminating, leading to religious discrimination issues regarding about the U.S. policy towards drugs. As the result of &quot;Peyote Way Church of God, Inc. v. Thornburgh&quot; the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 was passed. This federal statute allow the &quot;Traditional Indian religious use of the peyote sacrament&quot;, exempting only use by Native American persons.

== In literature ==
Many works of literature have described entheogen use; some of those are:
* The drug melange (spice) in Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; universe acts as both an entheogen (in large enough quantities) and an addictive geriatric medicine. Control of the supply of melange was crucial to the Empire, as it was necessary for, among other things, faster-than-light (folding space) navigation.
* Consumption of the imaginary mushroom &quot;anochi&quot; [enoki] as the entheogen underlying the creation of Christianity is the premise of Philip K. Dick&#x27;s last novel, &quot;The Transmigration of Timothy Archer&quot;, a theme that seems to be inspired by John Allegro&#x27;s book.
* Aldous Huxley&#x27;s final novel, &quot;Island&quot; (1962), depicted a fictional psychoactive mushroomtermed &quot;moksha medicine&quot;used by the people of Pala in rites of passage, such as the transition to adulthood and at the end of life.
* Bruce Sterling&#x27;s &quot;Holy Fire&quot; novel refers to the religion in the future as a result of entheogens, used freely by the population.
* In Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger&quot;, Book 1 of &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; series, the main character receives guidance after taking mescaline.
* The Alastair Reynolds novel &quot;Absolution Gap&quot; features a moon under the control of a religious government that uses neurological viruses to induce religious faith.
* A critical examination of the ethical and societal implications and relevance of &quot;entheogenic&quot; experiences can be found in Daniel Waterman and Casey William Hardison&#x27;s book &quot;Entheogens, Society &amp; Law: Towards a Politics of Consciousness, Autonomy and Responsibility&quot; (Melrose, Oxford 2013). This book includes a controversial analysis of the term entheogen arguing that Wasson et al. were mystifying the effects of the plants and traditions to which it refers.

<doc id="261904" wikidata="Q731316" url="?curid=261904" title="Paul Winchell">
<text>Paul Winchell (&quot;né&quot; Wilchinsky; December 21, 1922 – June 24, 2005) was an American ventriloquist, comedian, actor, humanitarian, and inventor whose career flourished in the 1950s and 1960s. From 1950 to 1954, he hosted &quot;The Paul Winchell Show&quot;, which also used two other titles during its prime time run on NBC: &quot;The Speidel Show&quot;, and &quot;What&#x27;s My Name?&quot;. From 1965 to 1968, Winchell hosted the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Winchell-Mahoney Time&quot;.

He made guest appearances on television series from the late 1950s to the mid 1970s, such as &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot;, &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;, and appearances as Homer Winch on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;. In animation, Winchell was the original voice of Tigger, Dick Dastardly, Gargamel, Scrubbing Bubbles, and other characters.

He also had medical training and became one of the first people to patent a mechanical artificial heart, implantable in the chest cavity (US Patent #3097366 of 1963). Winchell has been honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in television.

== Early life, family and education ==
Born Paul Wilchinsky in New York City on December 21, 1922, he was the son of Solomon Wilchinsky and Clara Fuchs. His father was a tailor. His grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Congress Poland and Austria-Hungary. 

At age 6, his legs atrophied after contracting polio. When he was 12 or 13, he came across a magazine advertisement offering a ventriloquism kit for ten cents. Back at school, he asked his art teacher, Jero Magon, if he could receive class credit for creating a ventriloquist&#x27;s dummy. Magon was agreeable, and Winchell thanked him by naming his creation Jerry Mahoney. Winchell went back to reading magazines, gathering jokes from them and putting together a comedy routine, which he then took to the &quot;Major Bowes Amateur Hour&quot; in 1938, winning first prize. A touring offer, playing various theaters with the Major Bowes Review, was part of the prize. Bandleader Ted Weems saw the young Winchell while on tour; he visited Winchell and made him an offer of employment. Winchell accepted and became a professional at age 14.

== Career ==

=== Ventriloquist work ===

Winchell&#x27;s best-known ventriloquist dummies were Jerry Mahoney and Knucklehead Smiff. Mahoney was carved by Chicago-based figure maker Frank Marshall. Sometime later Winchell had basswood copies of Jerry&#x27;s head made by a commercial duplicating service. One became the upgraded Jerry Mahoney that is seen primarily throughout Winchell&#x27;s television career. The television versions of Jerry and Knucklehead also featured Winchell&#x27;s innovation of actors slipping their hands into the sleeves of the dummies, giving the visual effect of gesturing with their hands while &quot;conversing&quot; with each other. He modified two other copies to create Knucklehead Smiff. The original Marshall Jerry Mahoney and one copy of Knucklehead Smiff are in storage at the Smithsonian Institution. The other two figures are in the collection of illusionist David Copperfield.

Winchell&#x27;s first show as a ventriloquist was on radio with Jerry Mahoney in 1943. The program was short-lived, however, as he was overshadowed by Edgar Bergen. Winchell also created Ozwald, a character that resembled Humpty Dumpty. The effect was accomplished by painting eyes and a nose on his chin, then adding a &quot;body&quot; covering the rest of his face, and finally electronically turning the camera image upside down. In 1961, Berwin Novelties introduced a home version of the character that included an Ozwald body, creative pencils to draw the eyes and nose, and a &quot;magic mirror&quot; that automatically turned a reflection upside down.

In 1948, Winchell and Joseph Dunninger were featured on &quot;Floor Show&quot; on NBC. Recorded via kinescope and replayed on WNBQ-TV in Chicago, the 8:30–9 p.m. Central Time show on Thursdays was the station&#x27;s first midweekly program.

During the 1950s, Winchell hosted children&#x27;s (&quot;The Paul Winchell and Jerry Mahoney Show&quot;) and adult programs with his figures for NBC Television, and later for syndication. The NBC Saturday morning program, sponsored by Tootsie Roll, featured a clubhouse motif and a theme song co-written by Winchell and his longtime bandleader and on-air sidekick, Milton Delugg. The theme song was titled &quot;HOORAY, HOORAH&quot; and featured the secret password &quot;SCOTTY WOTTY DOO DOO&quot;. An ending song titled &quot;Friends, Friends, Friends&quot; was sung by the children in the audience. In October 1956, Winchell moved to ABC, hosting &quot;Circus Time&quot; on Thursday evening for one season before returning to &quot;Winchell-Mahoney&quot; on Sunday afternoons. On one episode in late 1959, The Three Stooges appeared on the show to promote their joint feature film venture, &quot;Stop, Look and Laugh&quot;. Winchell made an appearance on &quot;Nanny and the Professor&quot; (Season 2, Episode 13) as a &quot;mean old man&quot; (a puppeteer who had retired into seclusion after losing his wife in an accident). In 1996, Winchell contracted with figure maker Tim Selberg to construct a more contemporary version of Jerry Mahoney, which Winchell described as &quot;Disney-esque&quot;. Winchell used the new figure version to pitch a new TV series idea to Michael Eisner. In 2009, Winchell was featured in the comedy documentary &quot;I&#x27;m No Dummy&quot;, directed by Bryan W. Simon.

=== Voice acting ===
Winchell&#x27;s career after 1968 included various voice roles for animated television series. For Hanna-Barbera, he played the character Dick Dastardly in multiple series (including &quot;Wacky Races&quot; and &quot;Dastardly and Muttley in their Flying Machines&quot;); Clyde and Softy on &quot;Wacky Races&quot; and &quot;The Perils of Penelope Pitstop&quot;; Fleegle on &quot;The Banana Splits Adventure Hour&quot;; and Gargamel on &quot;The Smurfs&quot;.

Winchell had also at one point, auditioned for the role of the Pillsbury Doughboy for the Pillsbury Company commercials, but lost out to Paul Frees.

He also provided the voice of Bubi Bear in &quot;Help!... It&#x27;s the Hair Bear Bunch!&quot; in 1971, Revs on &quot;Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch&quot;, Moe on &quot;The Robonic Stooges&quot;, and Shake on &quot;The CB Bears&quot;. In 1973, he did the voice of Goober the Dog on the H-B show &quot;Goober and the Ghost Chasers&quot; and also guest starred as the rain-making villain on an episode of &quot;Hong Kong Phooey&quot;. For Disney, Winchell voiced Tigger in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; featurettes, and won a Grammy Award for his performance in &quot;Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too&quot;.

Beginning with the television series &quot;The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;, he alternated in the role with Jim Cummings, the current voice of Pooh. Winchell&#x27;s final performances as Tigger were in 1999 for &quot;Winnie the Pooh: A Valentine for You&quot; and &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; attraction at Walt Disney World. After that, Jim Cummings permanently took over the role of Tigger, starting with &quot;Sing a Song with Pooh Bear&quot; in 1999 (though some of Winchell&#x27;s vocals from previous Pooh animations were included). Other Disney roles included parts in &quot;The Aristocats&quot; as a Siamese cat named Shun Gon, and &quot;The Fox and the Hound&quot; as Boomer the woodpecker. He was also the original voice of Zummi Gummi on the TV series &quot;Disney&#x27;s Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot; for seasons 1–5; Jim Cummings took over for the final season in 1990.

Winchell provided the voices of Sam-I-Am and the unnamed character Sam pesters in &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; from the animated television special &quot;Dr. Seuss on the Loose&quot; in 1973. He played Fleabag on &quot;The Oddball Couple&quot;, Fearless Freddy the Shark Hunter on the &quot;Pink Panther&quot; spinoff &quot;Misterjaw&quot; in 1976, as well as a number of one-shot characters in &quot;The Blue Racer&quot; series. In commercials, he voiced the character of Burger Chef for the fast food chain of the same name, the Scrubbing Bubbles for Dow Chemicals, and Mr. Owl for Tootsie Roll Pops.

From 1981 to 1989, Winchell voiced Gargamel on &quot;The Smurfs&quot; as well as on several Smurfs television movies. During the 1980s, he was called upon by Hanna-Barbera to reprise his role of Dick Dastardly on &quot;Yogi&#x27;s Treasure Hunt&quot; (which was a tour de force, featuring all of the H-B characters) and later on &quot;Wake, Rattle and Roll&quot; (which was a &quot;Wacky Races&quot; spinoff). Also on the animated movie &quot;Yogi Bear and the Magical Flight of the Spruce Goose&quot;, he did the voice of the Dread Baron, who was previously voiced by John Stephenson on the &quot;Laff-a-Lympics&quot;.

=== Live-action work ===
Winchell (often with Jerry Mahoney) was a frequent guest panelist on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; in 1956. (On the April 29 episode, in which Winchell was a panelist, the mystery guest was Edgar Bergen; after his identity was revealed, Jerry Mahoney and Mortimer Snerd carried on a conversation.) Other work included on-camera guest appearances on such series as &quot;The Polly Bergen Show&quot;; &quot;The Virginian&quot;; &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;; &quot;Perry Mason&quot;; &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;; &quot;Dan Raven&quot;; &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;; as Homer Winch on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;; and as Claude Wilbur on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;. He appeared in a 1960 motion picture that included a compilation of Three Stooges shorts (&quot;Stop!, Look and Laugh&quot;), and also in the Jerry Lewis movie &quot;Which Way to the Front?&quot;.

Winchell appeared as himself in 1963 in the NBC game show &quot;Your First Impression&quot;. He appeared in the late 1960s in a sketch on &quot;Rowan and Martin&#x27;s Laugh-in&quot; as a French ventriloquist named &quot;Lucky Pierre&quot;, who has the misfortune of having his elderly dummy die of a heart attack in the middle of his act. On &quot;Love, American Style&quot;, he appeared with fellow ventriloquist Shari Lewis in a sketch about two shy people in a waiting room who choose to introduce themselves to each other through their dummies.

=== &quot;Winchell-Mahoney Time&quot; ===
Winchell&#x27;s most successful TV show was &quot;Winchell-Mahoney Time&quot; (1965–1968), a children&#x27;s show written by his wife, actress Nina Russel. Winchell played several onscreen characters, including Knucklehead Smiff&#x27;s father, Bonehead Smiff. He also played himself as friend and adult adviser to Mahoney and Smiff. He also created &quot;Mr. Goody-good,&quot; a surreal character, by painting eyes and a nose on his chin, covering his face with a small costume, then having the camera image inverted. The resulting pinheaded character seemed to have an immensely wide mouth and a highly mobile head. Winchell created this illusion by moving his chin back and forth. The show was produced at KTTV in Los Angeles, which was owned by Metromedia.

Winchell started &quot;negotiating with Metromedia in 1970 to syndicate the 305 color segments of the show&quot;, but nothing came of it. Finally, &quot;Winchell offered to purchase the tapes outright for $100,000. Metromedia responded with an ultimatum...: Agree on a syndication plan or the tapes will be destroyed.&quot; When Winchell did not agree, Metromedia carried out with its threat and the tapes were erased and destroyed. Winchell sued Metromedia and in 1986 a jury awarded him &quot;$3.8 million for the value of the tapes and $14 million in punitive damages against Metromedia.&quot; Metromedia appealed the award all the way to the Supreme Court but was unsuccessful.

Winchell&#x27;s last regular on-camera TV appearances working with his puppets were &quot;Storybook Squares&quot;, a children&#x27;s version of the adult celebrity game show &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, which was seen Saturday mornings on NBC during the 1969 TV season, and &quot;Runaround&quot;, another children&#x27;s TV game show seen Saturday mornings on NBC from September 1972 to September 1973.

== Other pursuits ==

=== Medical and patents ===
Winchell was a pre-med student at Columbia University. He graduated from The Acupuncture Research College of Los Angeles in 1974 and became an acupuncturist. He also worked as a medical hypnotist at the Gibbs Institute in Hollywood. He owned more than 30 patents in his lifetime. He invented an artificial heart with the assistance of Dr. Henry Heimlich (inventor of the Heimlich maneuver) and held an early US patent for such a device. The University of Utah School of Medicine developed a similar apparatus around the same time, but when they tried to patent it, Winchell&#x27;s patents were cited as prior art. Eventually, Winchell donated his heart patents to the university.

There is some debate as to how much of Winchell&#x27;s design Robert Jarvik used in creating the Jarvik-7. Dr. Heimlich stated, &quot;I saw the heart, I saw the patent, and I saw the letters. The basic principle used in Winchell&#x27;s heart and Jarvik&#x27;s heart is exactly the same.&quot; Jarvik denied that any of Winchell&#x27;s design elements were incorporated into his device, which was first successfully implanted in Barney Clark in 1982.

Winchell established more medical patents while working on projects for the Leukemia Society (now known as the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society) and the American Red Cross. Other devices that he invented and patented included a disposable razor, a blood plasma defroster, a flameless cigarette lighter, a garter belt with no outwardly visible lines, a fountain pen with a retractable tip, and battery-heated gloves.

=== As a philanthropist ===
In the 1980s, Winchell&#x27;s concern about starvation in Africa led him to develop a method to cultivate tilapia in tribal villages and small communities. The fish thrives in brackish waters, which made it particularly well suited for sub-Saharan Africa. Winchell appeared before a Congressional committee with several other celebrities, including actors Richard Dreyfuss and Ed Asner, and Dr. Heimlich. The committee declined to finance a pilot program for the tilapia aquaculture project in Africa because it required digging wells into non-potable water.

== Personal life ==

Winchell had three children: a son, Stacy Paul Winchell; a daughter, Stephanie, from his first marriage to Dorothy &quot;Dottie&quot; Movitz; and a daughter, April Winchell (the current voice of Clarabelle Cow), who is a comedian and voice actress, from his second marriage to actress Nina Russel. His third wife was the former Jean Freeman. 

Winchell&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Winch&quot; (2004), exposed many details of Winchell&#x27;s life that had previously been kept private, including early stories of an abusive childhood, a long history of depression, and at least one mental breakdown, which resulted in a short stint in an institution. The book revealed the bad treatment Winchell had received from his mother for a considerable period, and the mental impact that continued to negatively affect him for decades after his mother&#x27;s death (Clara Wilchinski died in 1953 when she was only 58 years old, and Paul was 30). The autobiography caused a major estrangement between Winchell and his children, prompting daughter April to publicly defend her mother, who was negatively portrayed in the book.

After writing in &quot;God 2000: Religion Without the Bible&quot; (1982) that religion brought more chaos to humanity than any &quot;other invention of man&quot;, Winchell expressed deist opinions within his 2004 book &quot;Protect God&quot;.

== Death ==
Winchell died on June 24, 2005, at the age of 82, from natural causes in his sleep at his home in Moorpark, California. He was survived by his wife, his children, and three grandchildren. His remains were cremated, and his ashes scattered over his home property. 

Winchell was estranged from his children, and they were not immediately informed of his death. Upon learning of it, April posted an entry on her website:
I got a phone call a few minutes ago, telling me that my father passed away yesterday. A source close to my dad, or at least, closer than I was, decided to tell me himself, instead of letting me find out on the news, which I appreciate. Apparently a decision had been made not to tell me, or my father&#x27;s other children. My father was a very troubled and unhappy man. If there is another place after this one, it is my hope that he now has the peace that eluded him on earth.

Jim Cummings took on the role of Tigger full-time starting with &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot; (2000) after Winchell was rejected by the studio as it thought at that time that his voice and energy sounded and felt too old for the role of the character (at the time of the production of this movie Winchell was 75 years old). Tom Kenny and Peter Woodward took on the role of Dick Dastardly and Hank Azaria, Rainn Wilson, and Mark Irons took on the role of Gargamel.

<text>The Middle Atlantic Conferences (MAC) is an umbrella organization of three intercollegiate athletic conferences that competes in the NCAA&#x27;s Division III. The 16 member colleges are in the Mid-Atlantic United States.

The organization is divided into two main conferences: the MAC Commonwealth and the MAC Freedom. A third conference, named the Middle Atlantic Conference (singular), draws members from both the Commonwealth and Freedom conferences and sponsors sports that only a certain set of members participate in, such as track &amp; field and cross country.

==History==
In 1912, the Middle Atlantic States Collegiate Athletics Association (MASCAA) was founded primarily as a track association and had its first event, a track meet, at Lafayette College in May 1913. In 1922, it was reorganized as the Middle Atlantic States Collegiate Athletic Conference (MASCAC or MAC). The original 13 members present at the formation meeting in 1922 were: Bucknell University, Drexel University, Franklin &amp; Marshall College, Gettysburg College, Haverford College, Muhlenberg College, New York University, Princeton University, Rutgers University, Stevens Institute of Technology, Susquehanna University, Swarthmore College, and the University of Delaware. In addition, another five members who were not present at the initial meeting but formally approved of the plan were: Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University, Lehigh University, Ursinus College, and Widener University.

During its history, the organization has had at least 50 different members associated with it. The conference had as many as 37 members at one time in the late 1950s. A major reduction in the league occurred in 1974 after the NCAA created Divisions I, II, and III. At that time, 11 members left to form the Division I East Coast Conference and by 1976, the MAC became fully associated with Division III. An additional 11 members left in 1992 to form the Centennial Conference; the football programs for eight of those schools had already left in 1981. In 1999, the current corporation formed with its three conferences: MAC Commonwealth, MAC Freedom, and Middle Atlantic.

Arcadia University and Manhattanville College joined MAC Freedom for 2007–08. They replaced Juniata College, Drew University, Moravian College, Susquehanna University, and the University of Scranton, who left to join the new Landmark Conference. To offset the change in numbers, it was also decided to switch Lycoming College from the MAC Freedom to the MAC Commonwealth.

Alvernia University, Misericordia University, and Eastern University, all from the Pennsylvania Athletic Conference, accepted membership in the MAC Freedom and started participation in the 2008–09 school year. Starting in the 2009–10 school year, Alvernia switched from the MAC Freedom to the MAC Commonwealth, thereby giving the Commonwealth and Freedom leagues the same number of members.

Stevenson University and Hood College accepted invitations to join the MAC and MAC Commonwealth starting with the 2012–13, expanding the conference to 18 members. Elizabethtown College moved to the Landmark Conference for 2014–15. In May 2018, Manhattanville College announced that they would leave the MAC Freedom Conference and return to the Skyline Conference for the 2019–20 academic year. Manhattanville was a charter member of the Skyline before leaving to join the MAC in 2007. Three months later, the MAC announced that Stevens Institute of Technology, which had left the conference in 1978, would return in 2019–20 and replace Manhattanville in the MAC Freedom. In April 2019, the MAC announced that York College of Pennsylvania would join the MAC Commonwealth in 2020–21.

In May 2019, the MAC announced it would realign the Commonwealth and Freedom conferences into two equally-sized leagues effective with York&#x27;s arrival in 2020. At that time, Arcadia and Lycoming moved from the MAC Commonwealth to the MAC Freedom, while Eastern made the opposite move.

In February 2022, the Landmark Conference announced that Wilkes University and Lycoming College accepted invitations to the conference starting in the 2023-24 season.

==MAC football==
In 1958, the MAC began sponsoring football. The football conference essentially operated as three separate conferences with the larger schools (Bucknell, Delaware, Gettysburg, Lafayette, Lehigh, Muhlenberg, Rutgers, and Temple) playing a round-robin schedule in the &quot;University Division,&quot; and the smaller schools being split into the &quot;College Division - North&quot; (Albright, Dickinson, Juniata, Lebanon Valley, Lycoming, Moravian, Susquehanna, Wagner, and Wilkes) and the &quot;College Division - South&quot; (Drexel, Haverford, Johns Hopkins, Pennsylvania Military, Swarthmore, Ursinus, and Western Maryland) each playing a separate round-robin schedule. Although the upper division of the conference (which later included Drexel, La Salle, and Saint Joseph&#x27;s) competed at the Division I (then known as the University Division) level in other sports, only Rutgers was considered a University Division football school. Following the 1969 season, the upper level of MAC football was disbanded as Temple dropped out to upgrade their football schedule. Rutgers had previously dropped out of the MAC for all sports and a five-team football league was not desirable. The lower division continued as MAC football, but Bucknell, Delaware, Gettysburg, Lafayette, and Lehigh operated as football independents for the rest of their tenure with the league. Numerous other MAC schools competed in other football leagues throughout most of the league&#x27;s history.

In 1983, the Centennial Football League was formed by eight MAC members. Eventually, those eight schools and two others broke apart from the MAC for all sports, founding the Centennial Conference in 1991. Since then, all league members that sponsor football have competed in the MAC Football Conference.

==Sports==
Member teams currently compete in 27 sports, 14 men&#x27;s and 13 women&#x27;s. The most recently added sports are men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey and men&#x27;s volleyball, all added for 2017–18. The MAC now sponsors all NCAA Division III sports except women&#x27;s rowing.

===Middle Atlantic Conference===
The Middle Atlantic Conference combines schools from both the MAC Commonwealth and MAC Freedom and is currently used for cross country, football, women&#x27;s golf, ice hockey, track &amp; field (indoor / outdoor), swimming, men&#x27;s volleyball, and wrestling. The MAC officially sponsored men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey for many year but it wasn&#x27;t until the addition of Neumann and Wilkes as affiliate members that the conference received an automatic qualifier for the NCAA Tournament. As a result the first MAC ice hockey tournaments will take place in 2025. Previously, the MAC used the regular-season results of UCHC games involving all MAC members to extrapolate a MAC champion (the same model used by the Ivy League, which has a similar relationship with ECAC Hockey).

<text>Gilbert Raymond Hodges (born Hodge; April 4, 1924 – April 2, 1972) was an American first baseman and manager in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played most of his 18-year career for the Brooklyn / Los Angeles Dodgers. An eight-time All-Star, he anchored the infield for the Dodgers through six pennant winners and two World Series titles before leading the New York Mets to their first World Series title in . One of the most beloved and admired players in major league history, Hodges was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2022, fifty years after his sudden death.

Born in Princeton, Indiana, Hodges was the son of a coal miner. He grew up in Petersburg, Indiana where he was a four-sport athlete in high school, before attending Saint Joseph&#x27;s College where he played baseball and basketball. He dropped out to sign with the Brooklyn Dodgers, making his debut at age 19 before being joining the United States Marine Corps during World War II, receiving the Bronze Star Medal after serving in combat as an anti-aircraft gunner during in the battles of Tinian and Okinawa in the Pacific theatre. After being discharged, Hodges returned to the Dodgers&#x27; organization, making his way back to the majors in .

During his time with the Brooklyn Dodgers, Hodges was a core member of the &quot;Boys of Summer&quot;, along with Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Duke Snider, and Pee Wee Reese. He was widely regarded as the major leagues&#x27; outstanding first baseman in the 1950s, with Snider being the only player to have more home runs or runs batted in during the decade. Hodges held the National League (NL) record for career home runs by a right-handed hitter from 1960 to 1963, with his final total of 370 briefly ranking tenth in major league history; he held the NL record for career grand slams from 1957 to 1974. A sterling defensive player, Hodges won the first three Gold Glove Awards for his position and led the NL in double plays four times and in putouts, assists and fielding percentage three times each. He ranked second in NL history with 1,281 assists and 1,614 double plays when his career ended, and was among the league&#x27;s career leaders in games (6th, 1,908) and total chances (10th, 16,751) at first base.

After retiring as a player during the 1963 season, Hodges became the manager of the expansion Washington Senators. He did not have a winning season there, although the team did improve upon their win total each year during Hodges&#x27; 5-year tenure. Before the 1968 season, the New York Mets hired Hodges as manager. The following season, in what is considered one of the greatest championship runs in sports history, he led the team to their first winning season and World Series title. A heavy smoker, Hodges died suddenly from a heart attack two days before his 48th birthday, during spring training in 1972. The Mets retired his number, 14, the following season; 49 years later, during the 2022 season, the Dodgers, Hodges&#x27;s long-time team, followed suit after his election to the Hall of Fame.

==Early years==
Hodges was born Gilbert Raymond Hodge on April 4, 1924, in Princeton, Indiana, the son of Charles P. Hodge, a coal miner, and his wife Irene (&quot;née&quot; Horstmeyer). He had an older brother, Robert, and a younger sister, Marjorie. At some point, prior to 1930, the family name was changed from &#x27;Hodge&#x27; to &#x27;Hodges&#x27;.

When Hodges was seven, the family moved to nearby Petersburg. He was a star four-sport athlete at Petersburg High School, earning a combined seven varsity letters in football, baseball, basketball and track. Hodges declined a contract offer from the Detroit Tigers, instead attending Saint Joseph&#x27;s College with the hope of eventually becoming a collegiate coach. Hodges spent two years at St Joseph&#x27;s, competing in baseball and basketball. He dropped out after his sophomore year, accepting a contract from Stanley Feezle, a sporting goods storeowner and part-time scout, to sign with the Brooklyn Dodgers.

Aged 19, Hodges was called up by the Dodgers and made his debut on October 3, 1943, against the Cincinnati Reds, the last game of the 1943 season. Playing third base, he went 0-2 with two strikeouts and made two errors. A few days later, he entered the United States Marine Corps to serve in World War II.

=== Military service ===
Hodges entered the United States Marine Corps during World War II after having participated in its Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps program at Saint Joseph&#x27;s. He served in combat as an anti-aircraft gunner in the 16th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion, participating in the battles of Tinian and Okinawa, and received a Bronze Star Medal with Combat &quot;V&quot; for heroism under fire.

Following the war, Hodges also spent time completing course work at Oakland City University, near his hometown, playing basketball for the Mighty Oaks, joining the 1947–48 team after four games (1–3 record); they finished at 9–10. One of his teammates, Bob Lochmueller, would go on to star at the University of Louisville and play in the NBA.

After being discharged from the Marine Corps in 1946, Hodges returned to the Dodgers organization as a catcher with the Newport News Dodgers of the Piedmont League, batting .278 in 129 games as they won the league championship; his teammates included first baseman and future film and television star Chuck Connors.

==Playing career==
===The Boys of Summer===
Hodges was called up to Brooklyn in 1947, the same year that Jackie Robinson broke baseball&#x27;s color barrier. He played as a catcher, joining the team&#x27;s nucleus of Robinson, Pee Wee Reese and Carl Furillo. Hodges&#x27;s only appearance in the 1947 World Series against the New York Yankees was as a pinch hitter for pitcher Rex Barney in Game Seven, but he struck out. With the emergence of Roy Campanella behind the plate and Robinson&#x27;s move to second base in , manager Leo Durocher shifted Hodges to first base, and he batted .249 with 11 home runs and 70 runs batted in during his rookie season.

On June 25, , Hodges hit for the cycle on his way to his first of seven consecutive All-Star teams. For the season, his 115 runs batted in ranked fourth in the NL, and he tied Hack Wilson&#x27;s club record for right-handed hitters with 23 home runs. Defensively, he led the NL in putouts (1,336), double plays (142) and fielding average (.995). Facing the Yankees again in the 1949 World Series, he batted only .235 but drove in the sole run in Brooklyn&#x27;s only victory, a 1–0 triumph in Game 2. In Game 5, he hit a two-out, three-run homer in the seventh to pull the Dodgers within 10–6, but struck out to end the game and the Series.

On August 31, 1950, against the Boston Braves, Hodges joined Lou Gehrig as only the second player since 1900 to hit four home runs in a game without the benefit of extra innings; he hit them against four different pitchers, with the first coming off Warren Spahn. He also had seventeen total bases in the game, tied for third-most in Major League history. That year he also led the league in fielding (.994) and set an NL record with 159 double plays, breaking Frank McCormick&#x27;s mark of 153 with the 1939 Cincinnati Reds He finished 1950 third in the league in both homers (32) and runs batted in (113), and came in eighth in the Most Valuable Player voting.

In 1951, he became the first member of the Dodgers to hit 40 home runs, breaking Babe Herman&#x27;s 1930 mark of 35; Campanella hit 41 in 1953, but Hodges recaptured the record with 42 in 1954 before Snider eclipsed him again with 43 in 1956. His last home run of 1951 came on October 2 against the New York Giants, as the Dodgers tied the three-game NL playoff series at a game each with a 10–0 win; New York won the pennant the next day on Bobby Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Shot Heard &#x27;Round the World&quot;. That year, Hodges broke his own record for most double plays with 171, a record which stood until Donn Clendenon had 182 for the 1966 Pittsburgh Pirates; he also led the NL with 126 assists, and was second in home runs, third in runs (118) and total bases (307), fifth in slugging percentage (.527), and sixth in runs batted in (103).

In 1952, with his last home run of the season, Hodges tied Dolph Camilli&#x27;s Dodger team record of 139 home runs, surpassing him in 1953; Snider moved ahead of Hodges in 1956. That season, he again led the NL with 116 assists in the 1952 campaign and was third in the league in home runs (32) and fourth in runs batted in (102) and slugging (.500).

Near the end of the 1952 season, Hodges suffered through one of the most famous slumps in baseball history: after going hitless in his last four regular-season games of 1952, he also went hitless in all seven games of the 1952 World Series against the Yankees (finishing the Series 0-for-21 at the plate), with Brooklyn losing to the Yankees in the seven games. Hodges was also involved in a blown call in Game 5. Johnny Sain was batting for the Yankees in the 10th inning of Game 5 and grounded out, as ruled by first base umpire Art Passarella. The photograph of the play, however, shows Sain stepping on first base while Hodges, also with a foot on the bag, is reaching for the ball that is about a foot shy of entering his glove. Baseball commissioner Ford Frick, an ex-newspaperman himself, refused to defend Passarella.

When Hodges&#x27;s slump continued into the 1953 season, fans reacted with countless letters and good-luck gifts. One Brooklyn priest, Father Herbert Redmond of St. Francis Roman Catholic Church, told his flock: &quot;It&#x27;s too hot for a sermon today. Go home, keep the commandments, and say a prayer for Gil Hodges.&quot; Hodges began hitting again soon afterward, and rarely struggled again in the World Series. Teammate Carl Erskine, who described himself as a good Baptist, kidded him by saying, &quot;Gil, you just about made a believer out of me.&quot;

Hodges ended 1953 with a .302 batting average, finishing fifth in the NL in runs batted in (122) and sixth in home runs (31). Against the Yankees in the 1953 Series, Hodges hit .364; he had three hits, including a homer in the 9–5 Game 1 loss. However, the Dodgers again lost in six games. In 1954, under their new manager Walter Alston, Hodges set the team home run record with 42, hitting a career-high .304 and again leading the NL in putouts (1,381) and assists (132). He also set a still-standing record with 19 sacrifice flies. He was second in the league to Ted Kluszewski in home runs and runs batted in (130), fifth in total bases (335), and sixth in slugging (.579) and runs (106), and placed tenth in the Most Valuable Player vote.

In the 1955 season, Hodges&#x27;s regular-season production declined to a .289 average, 27 home runs and 102 runs batted in. Facing the Yankees in the World Series for the fifth time, he was 1-for-12 in the first three games before coming around. In Game 4, Hodges hit a two-run homer in the fourth inning to put Brooklyn ahead, 4–3, and later had a single that drove in a run as they held off the Yankees, 8–5; he also scored the first run in the Dodgers&#x27; 5–3 win in Game 5. In Game 7, he drove in Campanella with two out in the fourth inning for a 1–0 lead and added a sacrifice fly to score Reese with one out in the sixth inning. Johnny Podres scattered eight New York hits, and when Reese threw Elston Howard&#x27;s grounder to Hodges for the final out, Brooklyn had a 2–0 win and their first World Series title in franchise history and their only championship in Brooklyn.

In 1956, Hodges recorded 32 home runs and 87 runs batted in. Brooklyn won the pennant again, and once more met the Yankees in the World Series, but ended up losing in seven games. In the third inning of Game 1, he hit a three-run homer to put Brooklyn ahead, 5–2, as they went on to a 6–3 win; he had three hits and four runs batted in during the 13–8 slugfest in Game 2, scoring to give the Dodgers a 7–6 lead in the third and doubling in two runs each in the fourth and fifth innings for an 11–7 lead. In Don Larsen&#x27;s perfect game, Hodges struck out, flied to center, and lined to third base, as Brooklyn went on to lose in seven games.

In 1957, Hodges set the NL record for career grand slams, breaking the mark of 12 shared by Rogers Hornsby and Ralph Kiner; his final total of 14 was tied by Hank Aaron and Willie McCovey in 1972, and broken by Aaron in 1974. He finished seventh in the NL with a .299 batting average and fifth with 98 runs batted in, and leading the league with 1,317 putouts. He was also among the NL&#x27;s top ten players in home runs (27), hits (173), runs (94), triples (7), slugging (.511) and total bases (296); in late September, he drove in the last Dodgers run at Ebbets Field, and the last run in Brooklyn history. Hodges was named to his last All-Star team and placed seventh in the Most Valuable Player balloting, the highest position in his career.

===Move to Los Angeles===
Prior to the 1958 season, the Dodgers and their cross-town rivals the Giants relocated to Los Angeles and San Francisco respectively. On April 23, 1958, Hodges became the seventh player to hit 300 home runs in the NL, connecting off Dick Drott of the Chicago Cubs. That year he also tied a post-1900 record by leading the league in double plays (134) for the fourth time, equaling Frank McCormick and Ted Kluszewski; Donn Clendenon eventually broke the record in 1968. Hodges&#x27;s totals were 22 home runs and 64 runs batted in as the Dodgers finished in seventh place in their first season in California. He also broke Dolph Camilli&#x27;s NL record of 923 career strikeouts in 1958.

In 1959, the Dodgers captured their first pennant in Los Angeles, with Hodges contributing 25 home runs, 80 runs batted in, and a batting average of .276, coming in seventh in the league with a .513 slugging mark; he also led the NL with a .992 fielding average. He batted .391 in the 1959 World Series against the Chicago White Sox (his first against a team other than the Yankees), with his solo home run in the eighth inning of Game 4 giving the Dodgers a 5–4 win, as they triumphed in six games for another Series championship.

In 1960, Hodges broke Ralph Kiner&#x27;s NL record for right-handed hitters of 351 career home runs, and appeared on the TV program &quot;Home Run Derby&quot;. In his last season with the Dodgers in 1961, he became the team&#x27;s career runs batted in leader with 1,254, passing Zack Wheat; Snider moved ahead of him the following year. Hodges received the first three Rawlings Gold Glove Awards, from 1957 to 1959.

During spring training 1961, Hodges gave what was one of his biggest contributions to the Dodgers. Manager Walter Alston had appointed him acting manager for a B-squad game, against the Minnesota Twins in Orlando, Florida. Upon discovering that one of their pitchers, Ed Palmquist, had missed the flight, Hodges told that day&#x27;s starter, Sandy Koufax that he would have to pitch seven innings instead of the previously planned five. The game ended up becoming a turning point in Koufax&#x27;s career; after struggling with his control to start the game, he ended up pitching seven no-hit innings; Koufax went on to have a strong spring training and a breakthrough season in . Hodges himself was unable to manage the game, however, since he had been beaned during batting practice.

===Return to New York===

After being chosen in the 1961 MLB Expansion Draft, Hodges was one of the original 1962 Mets and, despite knee problems, was persuaded to continue his playing career in New York, hitting the first home run in franchise history. By the end of the year, in which he played only 54 games, he ranked tenth in MLB history with 370 home runs – second to only Jimmie Foxx among right-handed hitters. He also held the National League (NL) record for career home runs by a right-handed hitter from 1960 to 1963, and held the NL record for career grand slams from 1957 to 1974.

After 11 games with the Mets in 1963, during which he batted .227 with no homers and was plagued by injuries, he was traded to the Washington Senators in late May so that he could replace Mickey Vernon as Washington&#x27;s manager. Hodges immediately announced his retirement from playing in order to focus on his new position. His last game had been on May 5 in a doubleheader hosting the San Francisco Giants.

===Career overall===
An eight-time All-Star, Hodges batted .273 in his career with a .487 slugging percentage, 1,921 hits, 1,274 runs batted in, 1,105 runs, 370 home runs, 295 doubles and 63 stolen bases in 2,071 games. His 361 home runs with the Dodgers remain second in team history to Snider&#x27;s 389. His 1,614 career double plays placed him behind only Charlie Grimm (1733) in NL history, and were a major league record for a right-handed fielding first baseman until Chris Chambliss surpassed him in 1984. His 1,281 career assists ranked second in league history to Fred Tenney&#x27;s 1,363, and trailed only Ed Konetchy&#x27;s 1,292 among all right-handed first basemen.

At the start of the 1963 season, prior to his retirement, Hodges had hit the most home runs (370) by a right-handed batter up to that point in time (surpassed by Willie Mays just before Hodges retired, on April 19) and the most career grand slams (14) by a National League player (surpassed by Willie McCovey&#x27;s 18 grand slams). He shares the major league record of having hit four home runs in a single game (only 18 players have done so in Major League history).

==Managerial career==
=== Washington Senators ===
Hodges began the 1963 season as an active player, but decided to retire when the expansion Washington Senators asked him to be their manager. After clearing waivers, the Mets traded Hodges to the Senators for outfielder Jimmy Piersall on May 23, retiring from his playing career.

Hodges managed the Senators through 1967, and, while they never achieved a winning record during his time as manager, the Senators improved on their record from the previous seasons, peaking with a 76-85 record in 1967.

In December 1964, the Senators arranged a seven-player trade with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Hodges received outfielder Frank Howard, his former teammate, catcher Doug Camilli, pitchers Nick Willhite, Phil Ortega, and Pete Richert, first baseman Dick Nen, and third baseman Ken McMullen. These players, Howard in particular, would become the core of the Senators franchise for the next few years and helped the team to a sixth-place finish in the 1967 season and their only winning season in 1969.

During the 1965 season, Hodges saved the life of pitcher Ryne Duren, who was in his final season and had signed with the Senators after being released by the Philadelphia Phillies. On August 18, after a bad outing against the Chicago White Sox, the last of his career, Duren attempted to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge, later recalling: &quot;I put Gil through hell.&quot; The police went and got Hodges from the hotel at which the team was staying. Hodges managed to talk Duren down from the bridge, telling him, &quot;You are too good to do this to yourself.&quot;

When New York Mets manager Wes Westrum resigned as manager in September 1967, the Mets sought out Hodges as his replacement. Although he had one year left on his contract with the Senators, Hodges decided to take up the Mets&#x27; offer as he considered it more convenient; he still had financial interests in Brooklyn and his family and home was there. Hodges was also popular in New York and, hence, a natural fit for the Mets. Senators GM George Selkirk obliged after the Mets paid them $100,000 and sent pitcher Bill Denehy over as compensation. Hodges then signed a three-year, $150,000 contract with the New York Mets.

=== New York Mets ===
When Hodges took over as manager of the Mets, the team had yet to finish with a winning season. At the 1968 All-Star break, the Mets were just four games below .500. However, they could not maintain the pace and subsequently lost 46 of their remaining 80 games. While the team only posted a 73–89 record, finishing 9th in the National League, it was nonetheless the best mark in their seven years of existence up to that point.

On September 24, 1968, Hodges, a chain smoker since he picked up the habit during his service in World War II, suffered from what was described as a &quot;mild heart attack&quot; during a game against the Atlanta Braves.

==== 1969: The &quot;Miracle Mets&quot; ====

In 1969, Hodges led the New York Mets to their first winning season and the National League East title. They swept the Atlanta Braves in the inaugural, best-of-five National League Championship Series. They then went on to beat the heavily favored Baltimore Orioles in the World Series in five games.

After losing Game 1, the team came back for four straight victories, including two by 2–1 scores. Finishing higher than ninth place for the first time, the Mets became not only the first expansion team to win a World Series, but also the first team to win the Fall Classic after finishing at least 15 games under .500 the previous year. Hodges was named &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Manager of the Year for 1969.

During Game 5, in the bottom of the sixth, Orioles pitcher Dave McNally bounced a pitch that appeared to have hit Mets left fielder Cleon Jones on the foot, then bounced into the Mets&#x27; dugout. McNally and the Orioles argued that the ball hit the dirt and not Jones, but Hodges showed the ball to home plate umpire Lou DiMuro, who found a spot of shoe polish on the ball and awarded Jones first base. McNally subsequently gave up a two-run home run to Mets first baseman Donn Clendenon to cut the Orioles lead to 3–2. The Mets eventually won the game and the series, 5-3.

The controversial decision has gone down in baseball lore as the &quot;shoe polish&quot; incident, and it highlighted Hodges&#x27;s reputation for fair play, as he had never been thrown out a game for arguing, a fact that likely led to DiMuro ruling in favor of the Mets.

==== Final seasons ====
In Hodges&#x27; last two years as the manager of the Mets, the team had a winning record each time, finishing third in the National League East with an 83–79 record in both 1970 and 1971. However, his team never made the playoffs again.

In 1970, the Mets finished behind the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Chicago Cubs. In 1971, they finished tied at third with the Cubs in the NL East rankings, behind Pirates (eventual World Series champions) and the St. Louis Cardinals.

=== Managerial record ===


== Death and impact ==

On the afternoon of April 2, 1972, Easter Sunday, Hodges was playing golf in West Palm Beach, Florida because the exhibition game between the Mets and the Montreal Expos was cancelled due to the first players&#x27; strike. He completed 27 holes of golf with Mets coaches Joe Pignatano, Rube Walker, and Eddie Yost, when he collapsed en route to his motel room at the Ramada Inn across the street from Municipal Stadium, then the spring training facility of the Atlanta Braves and Expos. Hodges had suffered a heart attack and was rushed to Good Samaritan Hospital where he died within 20 minutes of arrival. Pignatano later recalled Hodges falling backwards and hitting his head on the sidewalk with a &quot;sickening knock&quot;, bleeding profusely and turning blue. Pignatano said &quot;I put my hand under Gil&#x27;s head, but before you knew it, the blood stopped. I knew he was dead. He died in my arms.&quot;

Jackie Robinson, himself ill with heart disease and diabetes, told the Associated Press, &quot;He was the core of the Brooklyn Dodgers. With this, and what&#x27;s happened to Campy and lot of other guys we played with, it scares you. I&#x27;ve been somewhat shocked by it all. I have tremendous feelings for Gil&#x27;s family and kids.&quot; Robinson died of a heart attack six months later on October 24 at age 53.

Duke Snider said &quot;Gil was a great player, but an even greater man.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m sick,&quot; said Johnny Podres, &quot;I&#x27;ve never known a finer man.&quot; A crushed Carl Erskine said &quot;Gil&#x27;s death is like a bolt out of the blue.&quot; Don Drysdale, who himself died in Montreal of a heart attack in 1993 at age 56, wrote in his autobiography that Hodges&#x27;s death &quot;absolutely shattered me. I just flew apart. I didn&#x27;t leave my apartment in Texas for three days. I didn&#x27;t want to see anybody. I couldn&#x27;t get myself to go to the funeral. It was like I&#x27;d lost a part of my family.&quot; According to Gil Hodges Jr., Howard Cosell, one of the many attendees at the wake, brought him into the back seat of a car, where Jackie Robinson had been crying hysterically. Robinson then held Hodges Jr. and said, &quot;Next to my son&#x27;s death, this is the worst day of my life.&quot;

The wake was held at Torregrossa Funeral Home, on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn. The funeral was held at Our Lady Help of Christians Church in Midwood, Brooklyn, on April 6. Approximately 600 people attended the church service inside, while thousands of mourners attended outside. Afterwards, he was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, about a mile and half from where Ebbets Field used to be.

Yogi Berra, the Mets&#x27; first base coach, succeeded him as manager on the day of the funeral. The American flag flew at half-staff on Opening Day at Shea Stadium, while the Mets wore black armbands on their left arms during the entire 1972 season in honor of Hodges.

== Honors ==
In 1969, Hodges received the Bronze Medallion, New York City&#x27;s highest civilian honor from Mayor John Lindsay.

On June 9, 1973, one year after his death, the Mets retired Hodges&#x27;s uniform number 14. After his election to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2022, the Los Angeles Dodgers, his longtime team, honored Hodges by retiring his uniform number 14 on June 4, 2022 with the visiting New York Mets present for ceremony.

On April 4, 1978, what would have been Hodges&#x27;s 54th birthday, the Marine Parkway Bridge, which connected Marine Park, Brooklyn to Rockaway, Queens, was renamed the Marine Parkway–Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge in his memory. Other Brooklyn locations named for him are a park on Carroll Street, a Little League field on Shell Road in Brooklyn, a section of Avenue L and P.S. 193. In addition, part of Bedford Avenue in Midwood, Brooklyn, is named Gil Hodges Way. A bowling alley in Mill Basin, Brooklyn, was formerly named Gil Hodges Lanes in his honor.

In Indiana, the high school baseball stadium in his birthplace of Princeton, Indiana is named after Hodges. A bridge spanning the East Fork of the White River in northern Pike County on State Road 57 was renamed the Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge. In addition, a Little League baseball team in his hometown of Petersburg was named the Hodges Dodgers, in his honor.

In 2009, a mural was dedicated in Petersburg featuring pictures of Hodges as a Brooklyn Dodger, as manager of the New York Mets, and batting at Ebbets Field.

Hodges became an inaugural member of the Indiana Baseball Hall of Fame in 1979. He was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 1982. In 2007, Hodges was inducted into the Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame.

In 2000, Hodges was featured in the documentary &quot;Gil Hodges: The Quiet Man&quot;, based on the book of the same name by author Marino Amoruso. In November 2021, a 30-minute documentary, titled &quot;The Gil Hodges Story: Soul Of A Champion&quot;, was released. The film featured interviews with Vin Scully, Tommy Lasorda, Carl Erskine, Gil Hodges Jr., and members of the 1969 New York Mets.

=== Hall of Fame candidacy and election ===
For decades, there was controversy over Hodges not being selected for induction to the Baseball Hall of Fame. He was considered to be one of the finest players of the 1950s, and graduated to managerial success with the Mets. However, critics of his candidacy pointed out that despite his offensive prowess, he never led the National League in any offensive category such as home runs, runs batted in, or slugging percentage, and never came close to winning a Most Valuable Player award. Additionally, until the election of Tony Pérez in 2000, every first baseman in the Hall had either 500 career home runs or a batting average over .295; at the time of Hodges&#x27;s death, the BBWAA had only elected two position players (Rabbit Maranville and Roy Campanella) with batting averages below .285. One theory for Hodges not being voted MVP may have resulted in part from his having had some of his best seasons (1950, 1954 and 1957) in years when the Dodgers did &quot;not&quot; win the pennant; his best finish was seventh in 1957.

==== BBWAA candidate ====
After last playing in the major leagues during the 1963 season, Hodges first appeared on the 1969 ballot, receiving 24.1% of ballots cast by BBWAA electors, with 75% the threshold for election. He was considered annually through the 1983 ballot, his 15th and final ballot appearance under BBWAA rules at the time. He appeared on 63.4% of ballots in 1983 voting, the highest percentage of his candidacy. Hodges collected 3,010 votes cast by the BBWAA from 1969 to 1983, the most votes for an unselected player until surpassed by Jim Rice in 2008, prior to Rice&#x27;s election the following year.

==== Veterans Committee candidate ====
Hodges was considered for selection by the Hall of Fame&#x27;s Veterans Committee starting in 1987. Voting by the committee was held in closed sessions for many years, but results are known for Hodges in voting (61%), (65%), (61%), and (43.8%). Each time, Hodges fell short of the 75% minimum required for election.

==== Golden Era/Golden Days candidate ====
In 2011, Hodges became a Golden Era candidate (1947–1972 era) for consideration to be elected to the Hall of Fame by the Golden Era Committee, which replaced the Veterans Committee in 2010. In December 2011, voting by the committee took place during the Hall of Fame&#x27;s two-day winter meeting in Dallas, Texas. Induction to the Hall requires at least 12 votes (75%) from the 16-member committee. Of 10 candidates, Ron Santo was the only one elected, having received 15 votes; Jim Kaat had 10 votes, and Hodges and Minnie Miñoso were tied with nine votes.

Hodges&#x27;s next opportunity under the Golden Era Committee was in December 2014, when the committee voted at the MLB winter meeting. Hodges received only three votes, and none of the other eight player candidates on the ballot were elected to the Hall of Fame, including Dick Allen and Tony Oliva, each of whom fell one vote shy of the 12-vote threshold. In July 2016, the Golden Era Committee was succeeded by a new system of four committees, including the Golden Days committee (1950–1969 era).

Hodges was one of 10 nominees named on November 5, 2021 to the Golden Days Era ballot for Hall of Fame consideration. On December 5, the Hall of Fame announced Hodges&#x27;s election, having received 12 of 16 votes to meet the 75% threshold. Hodges was formally inducted on July 24, 2022, with his daughter Irene delivering a speech on his behalf.

== Personal life ==
In 1948, Hodges married Joan Lombardi (September 27, 1926 – September 17, 2022), a native of Brooklyn. The couple had four children together: Gilbert Jr., Irene, Cynthia, and Barbara. The family resided in Midwood, Brooklyn where Hodges had several business investments, including a bowling alley. His nephew by marriage is Tom Verducci, sportswriter for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

Joan Hodges outlived her husband by 50 years. She died in September 2022, a month after her husband&#x27;s induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame and less than two weeks before her 96th birthday.

<text>The Midwest Conference (MWC) is an intercollegiate athletic conference affiliated with the NCAA&#x27;s Division III. Member institutions are located in the Midwestern United States in the states of Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. The Midwest Conference was created in 1994 with the merger of the Midwest Collegiate Athletic Conference, which had been sponsoring men&#x27;s sports since 1921, and the Midwest Athletic Conference for Women, which was formed in 1977.

==History==
The organization of the Midwest Collegiate Athletic Conference (MCAC) was conceived at a meeting at Coe College on May 12, 1921. Charter members were Beloit College, Carleton College, Coe College, Cornell College, Knox College (Illinois) and Lawrence University. Hamline University and Millikin University joined the league in December 1921, but both of them later withdrew: Hamline after the 1929–30 academic year, and Millikin after the 1924–25 academic year.

Ripon College joined the conference in 1923, followed by Monmouth College in 1924, Grinnell College in 1940 and Lake Forest College in 1974. Illinois College and St. Norbert College joined in 1982 and Carroll University followed in 1992. Carleton withdrew following the 1982–83 academic year. St. Olaf College also competed in the conference from 1952 to 1974, as did the University of Chicago from 1976 to 1987. Coe and Cornell withdrew following the 1996–97 academic year with Cornell rejoining the league starting in the 2012–13 year. Macalester College joined as a football-only member starting in 2014. The University of Chicago returned as a football-only member in 2017, and added baseball to its conference membership in the 2019 season (2018–19 school year).

The MWC split into North and South divisions for football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, baseball, and softball from 2012 through 2016. Divisional play ended with the departure of Carroll after the 2015–16 school year, and resumed for football only with the addition of the University of Chicago as an affiliate member for the 2017–18 season. St. Norbert left in 2021 for the Northern Athletics Collegiate Conference.

<text>The Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC ) is an intercollegiate athletic conference that competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III. All 13 of the member schools are located in Minnesota and are private institutions, with only two being non-sectarian.

==History==
On March 15, 1920, a formal constitution was adopted and the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference with founding members Carleton College, Gustavus Adolphus College, Hamline University, Macalester College, Saint John&#x27;s University, St. Olaf College, and the College of St. Thomas (now University of St. Thomas).

Concordia College joined the MIAC in 1921, Augsburg University in 1924, and Saint Mary&#x27;s University in 1926. Carleton dropped membership in 1925, rejoining in 1983. St. Olaf left in 1950, returning in 1975. The University of Minnesota Duluth was a member of the MIAC from 1950 to 1975. Bethel University joined in 1978. The MIAC initiated women&#x27;s competition in the 1981–82 season. Two all-women&#x27;s schools subsequently joined the conference, St. Catherine University in 1983 and the College of St. Benedict in 1985.

The conference did not play sports from the fall 1943 to the spring of 1945 due to World War II. Saint Mary&#x27;s discontinued its football program in 1955. Macalester football left the conference in 2002, but subsequently rejoined. St. Catherine and St. Benedict, being both women&#x27;s colleges, also do not sponsor football. Together with Saint John&#x27;s, one of only a handful of men&#x27;s colleges, St. Benedict forms a joint academic institution, known commonly by the initialism CSB/SJU.

From 1947 to 2003 the MIAC had a strong men&#x27;s wrestling program, which was discontinued following the 2002–03 season. The strongest teams over the history of the conference were Augsburg with 31 team championships, and Saint John&#x27;s with 14 team championships. The MIAC teams and individual wrestlers demonstrated a strong national and Olympic presence in the 1970s and beyond.

On May 22, 2019, it was announced that the University of St. Thomas would depart the MIAC at the end of spring 2021. St. Thomas by this point had over twice the enrollment of any other member institution. and on May 28, 2020, the conference announced the addition of the College of St. Scholastica after leaving the Upper Midwest Athletic Conference in 2021.

The conference split into two divisions for football in 2021. The Northwoods Division consists of Carleton College, Gustavus Adolphus College, Saint John&#x27;s University, St. Olaf College, and The College of St. Scholastica. The Skyline Division consists of Augsburg University, Bethel University, Concordia College, Hamline University, and Macalester College.

<text>Louis William Wain (5 August 1860 – 4 July 1939) was an English artist best known for his drawings of anthropomorphised cats and kittens. 

Wain was born in Clerkenwell, London. In 1881 he sold his first drawing and the following year gave up his teaching position at the West London School of Art to become a full-time illustrator. He married in 1884 but was widowed three years later. In 1890 he moved to the Kent coast with his mother and five sisters, and, except for three years spent in New York, remained there until the family returned to London in 1917. In 1914, he suffered a severe head injury in a horse-drawn omnibus accident and ten years later was certified insane. He spent the remaining fifteen years of his life in mental hospitals, where he continued to draw and paint. Some of his later abstract paintings have been seen as precursors of psychedelic art.

Wain produced hundreds of drawings and paintings a year for periodicals and books, including &quot;Louis Wain&#x27;s Annual&quot; which ran from 1901 to 1921. His work also appeared on postcards and advertising, and he made brief ventures into ceramics and animated cartoons. In spite of his popularity and prolific output, Wain did not become wealthy, possibly because he sold his work cheaply and relinquished copyright, and also because he supported his mother and five sisters.

==Early life==

Wain was born on 5 August 1860 in Clerkenwell in London. His father, William Matthew Wain (1825–1880), was a textile trader, living in London but originally from Leek, Staffordshire; his mother, Julie Felicie Boiteux (1833–1910), was a church embroiderer from a family of French origin. Wain&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Louis Boiteux, was an artist. Wain was the first child and only boy in the family. He had five younger sisters: Caroline, Josephine, Marie, Claire and Felicie.

Wain was born with a cleft lip and as a child was not in good health; he did not attend school until he was ten. He was sent first to Orchard Street Foundation School in South Hackney but spent much of his time playing truant and wandering around London, attending lectures at the Royal Polytechnic Institution or going on insect-hunting expeditions into the countryside. From 1873 to 1876 he attended St Joseph&#x27;s Academy in Kennington, a Catholic school (the Wain family was Catholic). He then did a course at the West London School of Art and was taken on as an assistant master at the school.

==Artistic career==

In December 1881, Wain&#x27;s first drawing to be published appeared in the Christmas 1881 issue of the &quot;Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News&quot;. It was a picture of bullfinches on laurel bushes, given the wrong title of &quot;Robins Breakfast&quot;. The following year he was offered a position on the magazine and was able to give up his teaching position at the West London School of Art.

On 30 January 1884 Wain married Emily Marie Richardson, who had been the governess of his sisters, in St Mary&#x27;s Chapel, Hampstead. The couple lived in Hampstead and were joined by Peter, a black-and-white kitten. Emily developed breast cancer soon after the marriage; Peter was a comfort to her and also, as Wain would later say, laid the foundation of his career as a cat artist. Encouraged by his wife, Wain sold his first published cat drawings to &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; in 1884. At this time he was also reporting on agricultural shows and pet shows, and taking commissions for animal portraits. By 1886 his cat pictures had been more widely noticed and he was commissioned by Macmillan to illustrate a children&#x27;s book, &quot;Mrs Tabby&#x27;s Establishment&quot;. His fame became established with the publication in the 1886 Christmas edition of &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; of his first drawing of anthropomorphised cats, &quot;A Kitten&#x27;s Christmas Party&quot;, which shows 150 cats celebrating Christmas in eleven panels. Wain had little time to share his success with his wife; Emily died in January 1887 after just three years of marriage.
As a young widower, Wain rented rooms in New Cavendish Street in the City of Westminster and moved in somewhat Bohemian circles that included journalists and artists such as Herbert Railton, Caton Woodville, Linley Sambourne, Harry Furniss, Melton Prior, and Phil May. At musical evenings, he would improvise on the piano. He worked to build up his reputation by taking on commissions for a variety of subjects, including architectural and landscape drawings as well as animals, for a number of journals. By 1890 he was a household name, and, in acknowledgment of his expertise on cats, was elected president of the National Cat Club. Two illustrations of cats&#x27; Christmas parties in 1890 marked a new development in his style of drawing cats, as they took on more human features with Wain often doing preliminary sketches of people in public places.

Wain&#x27;s father had died in 1880. His relationship with his mother and five sisters, none of whom married, had been strained as they had not approved of his marriage to Emily. But in 1890 there was a reconciliation and the family moved to the seaside resort of Westgate-on-Sea, Kent, where they rented a house belonging to Sir William Ingram, managing director of the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;. Wain took up gardening and walking, as well as various sports including running, swimming, ice skating, boxing and fencing. Two of Wain&#x27;s sisters, Claire and Felicie, were talented artists, but it was Wain who had to support the whole family and, although he was a popular and successful artist, money was always short. Bills were sometimes paid with pictures. Selling his pictures together with the copyright cheaply to publishers meant that he did not receive royalties when his work was reproduced and left him in straitened circumstances in later life.
Wain was a prolific artist, completing hundreds of pictures a year. His early work was mostly for periodicals but in the 1890s he turned his hand to illustrating children&#x27;s books; over his lifetime there would be more than 100. He wrote many of the books he illustrated, and, as an acknowledged expert on cats, contributed the section on the domestic cat in Hutchinson&#x27;s &quot;The Living Animals of the World&quot; (1901). In 1901, Wain produced the first &quot;Louis Wain Annual&quot;, which were published every year from 1901 to 1915 and in 1921. Between 1900 and 1940, 75 different publishers, including Raphael Tuck &amp; Sons and Valentine &amp; Sons, produced over 1100 of his images in postcard form. His work was also used in advertisements. Wain worked with a variety of media including watercolour, body colour, pen and ink, pencil, silverpoint, chalk and oil. His period of greatest popularity was in the years before World War I when he portrayed Edwardian society at leisure. His cats dressed as humans took part in sports, went to the seaside, tea parties, restaurants and celebrated Christmas, with activities sometimes ending in mishap and mayhem. Wain&#x27;s world was &quot;funny, edgy and animated&quot;.

In 1907, while his mother and sisters remained in Kent, Wain left for New York, where he was offered a contract by Hearst Newspapers. He returned to England in 1910, following the death of his mother. In 1914, he produced a series of &quot;futurist&quot; ceramic cats, described by one reviewer as &quot;the latest thing in freak ornaments&quot;. In October 1914, Wain fell from the platform of an omnibus in London and suffered a head injury which left him in a coma. He spent three weeks in hospital and was ordered to rest for six months. In 1917, Wain and his four surviving sisters left Westgate and moved to Kilburn in London. Marie Louisa had died in 1913 after twelve years spent in the East Kent County Lunatic Asylum. His eldest sister, Caroline, died of influenza soon after the move to Kilburn.

==Later life and death==
By the end of World War I, demand for Wain&#x27;s pictures had declined significantly and, in spite of commissions from the publisher Valentine &amp; Sons for a series of children&#x27;s books, his financial situation deteriorated. He made a short-lived venture into film animation, drawing the first ever screen cartoon cat &quot;Pussyfoot&quot;, but the cartoons were not a cinema success. Hutchinson published a last &quot;Louis Wain Annual&quot; in 1921. A new aspect to Wain&#x27;s drawings in this volume was the prominence of patterned fabrics.

In 1924, Wain&#x27;s sisters had him certified insane and admitted to a pauper ward at Springfield Mental Hospital in Tooting, South London. He continued to produce artworks in the hospital, with his sisters removing his pictures to sell. When the bookseller Dan Rider, who was on an asylum visiting committee, came across Wain in the hospital, he set up an appeal to raise money for the artist. An exhibition of Wain&#x27;s work was arranged and over £2,300 was raised, although only £640 of this found its way to Wain and his sisters (who had also become beneficiaries of the fund). The prime minister Ramsay MacDonald then set up a fund for Wain&#x27;s sisters and also arranged civil list pensions for them &quot;in recognition of their brother&#x27;s services to popular art&quot;. Wain had in the meantime been transferred to more comfortable conditions at Bethlem Hospital, where a fellow patient later recalled him as &quot;a very gentle amiable old man always clean and neat... He was liked by all the curious mixture of humanity that was, at that time, suffering from some kind or other of mental stress.&quot; In May 1930, he was moved again to Napsbury Hospital in Hertfordshire, where he continued to draw and paint. A successful exhibition of his work was held at the Brook Street Art Galleries in 1931, with proceeds going to his sisters. During this period Wain still drew cats, some of them stylised, but also drew landscapes in vivid colours. At Christmas he participated in decorating the wards, as he had done at Bethlem, and painted Christmas scenes on mirrors.

In November 1938, Wain suffered a stroke. His health further declined and he died on 4 July 1939 and was buried in St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green. He was survived by two sisters, Claire and Felicie, his sister Josephine having died six months before him. A memorial exhibition was held in Brook Street Galleries in September 1939.

==Legacy==
During a radio broadcast to support the 1925 appeal for Wain, the writer H. G. Wells said of Wain: &quot;He has made the cat his own. He invented a cat style, a cat society, a whole cat world. English cats that do not look and live like Louis Wain cats are ashamed of themselves.&quot; The same year Ramsay MacDonald wrote: &quot;Louis Wain was on all our walls some 15 to 20 years ago. Probably no artist has given a greater number of young people pleasure than he has&quot;.
Wain was seen as a leading authority on cats, becoming president and chairman of the National Cat Club and serving as a judge in cat shows. He was also in demand by the growing number of organisations devoted to animal welfare. He was seen as responsible for raising the social status of cats, of taking them from the parlour to a position where even members of parliament could proudly announce their enthusiasm for them without fear of ridicule. In spite of his undoubted expertise, some of Wain&#x27;s theories on the breeding and nature of cats were seen as eccentric, just as were some of his ideas on philosophy and science.

Since Wain spent the last fifteen years of his life in mental hospitals, there has been speculation about his mental condition and suggestions that he was suffering from schizophrenia, with examples of his art appearing in several psychology text books in chapters covering the disorder. In 1939, a psychiatrist, Walter Maclay, found some paintings by Wain in a shop in Campden Hill and put them in a sequence that, he claimed, showed evidence of a deterioration in the artist&#x27;s mental state due to schizophrenia, even though the paintings were not dated. Maclay&#x27;s theory has been challenged as Wain was still producing paintings in his old style, as well as more abstract &quot;kaleidoscopic&quot; designs, while at Napsbury. Marking the centenary of Wain&#x27;s birth in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, cat expert Sidney Denham suggested that Wain&#x27;s breakdown had been triggered by his head injury, coming after a number of severe mental shocks.

=== In popular culture ===
Wain&#x27;s later work, where his cats dissolve into kaleidoscopic abstract patterns, has been identified as an important precursor to 1960s psychedelic art.

In 1972, the Victoria and Albert Museum devoted a major exhibition to Wain&#x27;s work.

Wain&#x27;s life is the subject of &quot;The Electrical Life of Louis Wain&quot;, a 2021 Amazon Studios production starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Wain and Claire Foy as his wife Emily Richardson.

<text>Chinese Canadians are Canadians of full or partial Han Chinese ancestry, which includes both naturalized Chinese immigrants and Canadian-born Chinese. They comprise a subgroup of East Asian Canadians which is a further subgroup of Asian Canadians. Demographic research tends to include immigrants from Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau, as well as overseas Chinese who have immigrated from Southeast Asia and South America into the broadly defined Chinese Canadian category.

Canadians who identify themselves as being of Chinese ethnic origin make up about 5.1% of the Canadian population, or about 1.77 million people according to the 2016 census.

While other Asian groups are growing rapidly in the country, the Chinese Canadian community fell slightly to 1.71 million, or 4.63% of the Canadian population, in the 2021 Canadian census.

The Chinese Canadian community is the second largest ethnic group of Asian Canadians after Indians, constituting approximately 30% of the Asian Canadian population. Most Canadians of Chinese descent are concentrated within the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia.

==History==
===Pre-19th century===
The first record of Chinese in what is known as Canada today can be dated back to 1788. The British fur trader John Meares hired a group of roughly 70 Chinese carpenters from Macau and employed them to build a ship, the &quot;North West America&quot;, at Nootka Sound, Vancouver Island, British Columbia. This was then an important European outpost on the Pacific coast, disputed between Spain and Britain. The British post was seized by Spain, and thereafter was abandoned by Meares. The later fortunes of the Chinese carpenters is unknown.

===19th century ===

Before 1885 and the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), access to British Columbia from other parts of Canada was difficult. The creation of a better transportation system was essential to integration of British Columbia into the new Confederation.

Chinese railway workers made up the labour force for construction of two one-hundred mile sections of the Canadian Pacific Railway from the Pacific to Craigellachie in the Eagle Pass in British Columbia. When British Columbia agreed to join Confederation in 1871, one of the conditions was that the Dominion government build a railway linking B.C. with eastern Canada within 10 years. British Columbian politicians and their electorate agitated for an immigration program from the British Isles to provide this railway labour, but Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald, betrayed the wishes of his constituency (Victoria) by insisting the project cut costs by employing Chinese immigrants to build the railway, and summarized the situation this way to Parliament in 1882: &quot;It is simply a question of alternatives: either you must have this labour or you can&#x27;t have the railway.&quot; (British Columbian politicians had wanted a settlement-immigration plan for workers from the British Isles, but Canadian politicians and investors said it would be too expensive).

Chinese communities in Canada in the 19th and well into the 20th centuries were organized around the traditional kinship systems linking people belonging to the same clans together.
As not everyone in the Chinese communities necessarily belonged to the same clans, &quot;voluntary&quot; associations that functioned in many ways like guilds that provided social welfare, community events and a forum for politics became very important in Chinese-Canadian communities. Linking together all of the voluntary associations were Benevolent Associations that in effect ran the various Chinatowns in Canada, mediating disputes within the communities and providing for leaders who negotiated with Canadian politicians. As many Chinese immigrants knew little or no English, and most white Canadians did not welcome them, the Chinatowns tended to be cut off from the wider Canadian communities, functioning as &quot;islands&quot;. The Canadian media in the late 19th and early 20th centuries depicted the Chinatowns in lurid and sensationalist terms as centres of &quot;filth&quot;; using the very poverty of the Chinese against them, Canadian newspapers frequently claimed that the Chinese immigrants were an innately dirty people who carried infectious diseases and were prone to criminality. Reflecting the popularity of &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; stereotypes, the media blamed Chinese immigrants for all the crime in Canada, depicting the Chinese as luring innocent white Canadians into gambling, prostitution and drug addiction.

Many workers from Guangdong Province (mainly Taishanese people and Pearl River Delta peoples) arrived to help build the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 19th century as did Chinese veterans of the gold rushes. These workers accepted the terms offered by the Chinese labour contractors who were engaged by the railway construction company to hire them—low pay, long hours, lower wages than non-Chinese workers and dangerous working conditions, in order to support their families that stayed in China. Their willingness to endure hardship for low wages enraged fellow non-Chinese workers who thought they were unnecessarily complicating the labour market situations. Most of the Chinese immigrants in the 19th century spoke Cantonese and their term for Canada was &quot;Gum San&quot; (). The name &quot;Gum San&quot;, which concerned a supposed gigantic mountain made of pure gold located somewhere in the Rockies, was not taken literally, but instead was a metaphor for the hopes of Chinese immigrants for greater wealth in Canada. Almost all of the Chinese immigrants in the 19th century were young men, with women staying behind in China with the hope of marrying a &quot;Gold mountain guest&quot; as those who made money in Canada usually returned to China. Unable to marry white women, many Chinese men in Canada married First Nations women as the Indian peoples were more willingly to accept them.

From the passage of the Chinese Immigration Act in 1885, the Canadian government began to charge a substantial head tax for each Chinese person trying to immigrate to Canada. The Chinese were the only ethnic group that had to pay such a tax. Owing to the fear of the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;, in 1895 the government of Mackenzie Bowell passed an act forbidding any Asian-Canadian to vote or hold office.

===Early 20th century===
In 1902, the Liberal Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier appointed a Royal Commission on Chinese and Japanese Immigration, whose report stated that the Asians were &quot;unfit for full citizenship ... obnoxious to a free community and dangerous to the state.&quot; Following the Royal Commission&#x27;s report, Parliament voted to increase the Chinese head tax to $500, which temporarily caused Chinese immigration to Canada to stop. However, those Chinese wishing to go to Canada began to save up money to pay the head tax, which led to agitation, especially in British Columbia for the Dominion government to ban Asian immigration. Between September 7–9, 1907, an anti-Asian pogrom took place in Vancouver. The Asiatic Exclusion League organized attacks against homes and businesses owned by Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Indian immigrants under the slogan &quot;White Canada Forever!&quot;; though no one was killed, much property damage was done and numerous Asian-Canadians were beaten.
The 1907 pogrom was merely the most dramatic expression of the continuous agitation in Canada, especially in western Canada and among the working class, for the total exclusion of Asian immigration to Canada. In 1922, the feminist Emily Murphy published her best-selling book &quot;The Black Candle&quot; blaming Chinese and black immigrants for allegedly causing the problems of drug addiction among white Canadians. In 1923, the federal Liberal government of William Lyon Mackenzie King banned Chinese immigration with the passage of the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923, although numerous exemptions for businessmen, clergy, students and others did not end immigration entirely. With this act, the Chinese received similar legal treatment to blacks before them who Canada also had specifically excluded from immigration on the basis of race. (This was formalised in 1911 by Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier who in Sub-section (c) of Section 38 of the Immigration Act called blacks &quot;unsuitable&quot; for Canada.) During the next 25 years, more and more laws against the Chinese were passed. Most jobs were closed to Chinese men and women. Many Chinese opened their own restaurants and laundry businesses. In British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Ontario, Chinese employers were not allowed to hire white females. Ernest Chewant Mark, an immigrant who arrived in Canada in 1908, emerged as one of the leading critics of the 1923 Exclusion Act, and worked closely with Senator William Proudfoot, a Presbyterian minister, into seeking to pressure the government to repeal the act.
Some of those Chinese-Canadian workers settled in Canada after the railway was constructed. Most could not bring the rest of their families, including immediate relatives, due to government restrictions and enormous processing fees. They established Chinatowns and societies in undesirable sections of the cities, such as Dupont Street (now East Pender) in Vancouver, which had been the focus of the early city&#x27;s red-light district until Chinese merchants took over the area from the 1890s onwards. During the Great Depression, life was even tougher for the Chinese than it was for other Canadians. In Alberta, for example, Chinese Canadians received relief payments of less than half the amount paid to other Canadians. And because the Chinese Exclusion Act prohibited any additional immigration from China, the Chinese men who had arrived earlier had to face these hardships alone, without the companionship of their wives and children. Census data from 1931 shows that there were 1,240 men to every 100 women in Chinese Canadian communities. To protest the Chinese Exclusion Act, Chinese Canadians closed their businesses and boycotted Dominion Day celebrations every July 1, which became known as &quot;Humiliation Day&quot; by the Chinese Canadians. The film-maker Melinda Friedman stated about her interviews with Chinese Canadian veterans of World War II: &quot;The thing that was the most shocking to me was hearing from the veterans ... describe what life was like in Vancouver as late as 1940, with the Ku Klux Klan living in Vancouver who were targeting, quite often, the Chinese community.&quot;

In 1937, when Japan attacked China, the government of Chiang Kai-shek asked for the overseas Chinese communities to support the homeland. From 1937 onward, the Chinese Canadian community regularly organized fund-raising events to raise money for China. By 1945, the Chinese Canadians had contributed $5 million Canadian dollars to China. Following the Xi&#x27;an Incident of December 1936, a &quot;United Front&quot; bringing together the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang had been formed to resist Japanese aggression, which was soon put to the test when Japan invaded China in July 1937. Within the Chinese Canadian communities, a &quot;United Front&quot; atmosphere prevailed from the summer of 1937 on as various community leaders put aside their differences to focus on supporting China. Starting in 1937, a boycott was organized of Japanese goods, and Canadian businesses that sold war materials to Japan were subject of demonstrations. One of the main slogans used at the demonstrations was &quot;Don&#x27;t Kill Babies&quot;, a reference to the Imperial Japanese Army&#x27;s habit of using Chinese infants for &quot;bayonet practice&quot;.

=== Second World War ===
The Second World War became the turning point in history of Chinese Canadians. To show support for the war, fund-raising events were held from September 1939 to raise money for the Canadian war effort, and by 1945, Chinese Canadians had purchased some $10 million worth of Victory Bonds. The Chinese community of Victoria was praised in a parliamentary resolution for being especially active in holding events to encourage people to buy Victory Bonds. In December 1941, Canada declared war on Japan, and from time onward, China was an ally, which helped to change white Canadian views.

The African American newspaper &quot;The Pittsburgh Courier&quot; called for the &quot;double victory&quot; or &quot;Double V campaign&quot; in a 1942 editorial, urging black Americans to work for victory over fascism abroad and racism at home. Though originally intended for black Americans, the slogan of &quot;double victory&quot; was taken up by Asian-American groups as well. The same slogan of &quot;double victory&quot; came to be embraced by Chinese Canadians. Despite not being allowed to vote or hold office, about 600 Chinese Canadians enlisted as &quot;active&quot; members to fight overseas (until late 1944 all Canadians serving abroad were volunteers). The prime minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King, did not want Chinese Canadians to serve in the military as he knew that veterans would demand the right to vote just as Chinese Canadian veterans had done after World War I, but strong pressure from the British Special Operations Executive, which needed Asian Canadians to work as agents who could go undercover in Japanese-occupied Asia, forced his hand. Unlike in the First World War, where about 300 Chinese Canadians had served in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, this time Chinese Canadians serving in the Canadian military were given officers&#x27; commissions. All three services were reluctant to have Chinese Canadians given officers&#x27; commissions as having Asian men serving as officers giving orders to white men challenged the racial hierarchy. However, all those serving as airmen in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) were officers, and once Chinese Canadian airmen received officers&#x27; commissions, both the Army and the Navy were forced to follow suit. The RCAF was the service most open to Chinese Canadians because of the heavy losses taken in the bombing offensive against Germany. For RCAF, a 5% loss ratio was considered crippling and between March 5 – June 24, 1943, the 6th Group of the RCAF lost 100 bombers in air raids over Germany, suffering a 7% loss ratio; altogether, 9,980 Canadians were killed in bombing raids against German cities between 1940 and 1945, making the strategic bombing offensive one of the most costly operations for Canada in World War II.

In 1943, William Lore was commissioned as a lieutenant commander in the Royal Canadian Navy, becoming the first person of Chinese descent to be given an officer&#x27;s commission in any of the Commonwealth navies. Lore was the first Allied officer to land in Hong Kong on August 30, 1945, and it he who announced to the surviving Canadian POWs, who had been held in barbaric conditions by the Japanese since surrendering on Christmas Day in 1941, being reduced down to &quot;human skeletons&quot;, that they were now free men. Kam Hem Douglas Sam of the Royal Canadian Air Force, who had been serving on a Halifax bomber was shot down over France on June 28, 1944, and joined the French resistance, being awarded the Croix de Guerre from France after the war for his work with the resistance. Sam, who came from Victoria and could remember some French from high school, was able to pass himself off as a Vietnamese student in Reims. Sam first served with as a liaison with the Special Operations Executive (SOE) to organize landings of arms to the resistance from Britain. Sam later fought with the resistance, ambushing German troops on their way to Normandy. Flying Officer Quan Jil Louie of the RCAF was killed in early 1945 when his bomber was shot down over Germany. As Louie came from one of the more wealthier families of Vancouver&#x27;s Chinatown, his death in action attracted much attention in Vancouver, and with it commentary he was not allowed to vote or hold office.
A number of Chinese Canadians were recruited by the SOE to serve in Japanese-occupied regions of China and Southeast Asia. About 150 Chinese Canadians served with the SOE Force 136 behind Japanese lines in Burma. Douglas Jung, who later become the first Chinese-Canadian MP, served as a SOE agent in Japanese-occupied Malaya in 1944–45, which was highly dangerous work as the &quot;Kenpeitai&quot;, the much feared Japanese military police, would give no mercy to any Allied agent whom they captured. Those serving with the Force 136 were given cyanide pills to take if faced with capture by the Japanese as it was known that any SOE agent captured by the Japanese would be tortured and killed. Another Chinese Canadian, Bill Chong, served with the British Army Aid Group in Hong Kong and southern China, smuggling out POWs to Free China (i.e. not occupied by the Japanese) and delivering aid to resistance groups. The willingness of Chinese Canadians to fight and if necessary die for Canada in the war changed public perceptions, and for the first time newspapers began to call for the repeal of the 1895 law which forbade all Asian Canadians to vote or hold offices. The Canadian historian Brereton Greenhous wrote of the efforts of the men of Force 136: &quot;Several of them were decorated for their actions, and their service was a major factor in influencing the Canadian government to grant Chinese and Japanese Canadians full rights as Canadian citizens several years later&quot;.

Frank Wong of Vancouver who served with the Royal Canadian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers in Northwestern Europe in 1944–1945 recalled that his service with the Army was the first time he had been treated as an equal, stating: &quot;They treated me just like an equal. You have your uniform, you&#x27;re in it together; you eat together and you sleep together.&quot;. Like other Chinese Canadian veterans, Wong argued for equality of treatment, asking why he should be treated as a second-class citizen despite his war services. Wong stated his reasons for enlisting were: &quot;I decided maybe if I joined the armed forces, after the war they would give me the right to vote&quot;. Peggy Lee of Toronto by contrast stated her reasons for enlisting in 1942 with the Women&#x27;s Ambulance Corps was &quot;do my bit&quot; for Canada. Roy Mah who served with the SOE behind Japanese lines in Burma stated: &quot;We thought that serving in the armed forces would be an opportunity for us to prove to the general public that we are loyal Canadians, that in time of need, they would see that we have no hesitation to don the King&#x27;s uniform and go overseas to fight for our country, fight to preserve democracy.&quot; The Canadian historian Henry Yu stated about the efforts of Chinese-Canadian veterans: &quot;They had to accept that they had fought this war—a good war in everyone&#x27;s estimation—and they were still coming back to places built around white supremacy. So for some of them, they began vocally to argue: Why can&#x27;t we vote still?&quot;

Many Chinese Canadians argued that if Canada was fighting against not only Nazi Germany but her racist ideologies such as the &quot;Völkisch&quot; movement, then it was hypocritical for so many white Canadians to support attitudes of white supremacy back home. Chinese-Canadian veteran Frank Wong described the situation as being unable to &quot;live outside Chinatown, and professional jobs were not available to [Chinese Canadians]. I wasn&#x27;t even allowed to go swimming in a public pool.&quot; The contributions of Chinese Canadians toward the eventual allied victory did not spell an end to discrimination for them in Canada, although these attitudes did eventually start to dissipate. According to Chinese-Canadian veteran George Chow, after being treated &quot;like a second-class citizen&quot; in youth, during his service he was treated &quot;just like an equal&quot;, elaborating on his service as such: &quot;you have your uniform, you&#x27;re in it together; you eat together and you sleep together.&quot; Catherine Clement, the curator of Chinese Canadian Military Museum in Vancouver stated: &quot;It&#x27;s called a double victory because they not only helped Canada win the war, but they also helped propel the civil rights movement for the Chinese-Canadians.&quot;

Canada was slow to lift the restrictions against the Chinese Canadians and grant them full rights as Canadian citizens. Because Canada signed the United Nations Charter of Human Rights at the conclusion of the Second World War, the Canadian government had to repeal the Chinese Exclusion Act, which contravened the UN Charter. The same year, 1947, Chinese Canadians were finally granted the right to vote in federal elections. Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King was opposed to granting the franchise to Chinese Canadians, but Chinese-Canadian veterans led a coalition of churches, unions, civic groups and veterans&#x27; associations into pressuring the King government to end the exclusion of Chinese Canadians from the franchise. Friedman stated about Chinese-Canadian enfranchisement: &quot;Canada has this great spot on the world stage—as just, fair and level-headed country—but the reason it is that way is because Chinese residents forced that issue and made it more just.&quot; One Second World War veteran, Ronald Lee, remembered when he learned that Chinese Canadians could now vote together with repeal of the Exclusion Act: &quot;Down in Chinatown, we celebrated because we were Canadians! We were able to bring our families from China. It was quite the jubilation.&quot; Arguing that it was unjust to discriminate against veterans, professions such as the law, medicine and engineering were opened for Chinese Canadians for the first time after 1945.However, it took another 20 years, until the points system was adopted for selecting immigrants, for the Chinese to begin to be admitted under the same criteria as any other applicants. In the 1957 election, the Second World War veteran Douglas Jung was elected as a Progressive Conservative for the riding of Vancouver Centre, becoming the first Chinese Canadian elected to the House of Commons. Jung&#x27;s election, which proved that white voters would vote for a Chinese Canadian, marked the beginning of a trend where Chinese Canadians cease to depend upon the Benevolent Associations to negotiate with the politicians and instead Chinese Canadians became politically active themselves. After many years of organized calls for an official Canadian government public apology and redress to the historic Head tax, the minority Conservative government of Stephen Harper announced, as part of their pre-election campaign, an official apology. On June 22, 2006, Prime Minister Stephen Harper delivered a message of redress in the House of Commons, calling it a &quot;grave injustice&quot;.

Some educated Chinese arrived in Canada during the war as refugees. Since the mid-20th century, most new Chinese Canadians come from university-educated families, who of still consider quality education an essential value. These newcomers are a major part of the &quot;brain gain&quot;, the inverse of the infamous &quot;brain drain&quot;, i.e., the occurrence of many Canadians leaving to the United States, of which Chinese have also been a part.

=== Late 20th century ===
From 1947 to the early 1970s, Chinese immigrants to Canada came mostly from Hong Kong, Taiwan, or Southeast Asia. Chinese from the mainland who were eligible in the family reunification program had to visit the Canadian High Commission in Hong Kong, since Canada and the PRC did not have diplomatic relations until 1970. From the late 1980s, an influx of Taiwanese people immigrated to Canada forming a group of Taiwanese Canadians. They settled in areas such as Vancouver, British Columbia and to the adjacent cities of Burnaby, Richmond and Coquitlam. There was a significant influx of wealthy Chinese entrepreneurs from Hong Kong in the early and mid-1990s before the handover of Hong Kong to the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). Canada was a preferred location, in part because investment visas were significantly easier to obtain than visas to the United States. Vancouver, Richmond and Toronto were the major destinations of these Chinese. During those years, immigrants from Hong Kong alone made up to 46% of all Chinese immigrants to Canada. After 1997, a significant portion of Chinese immigrants chose to move back to Hong Kong, some of a more permanent nature, after the dust of the handover was settled and fears of a &quot;Communist takeover&quot; turned out to be unnecessary.

Starting in the late 20th century, Chinese Canadians have become active in the cultural scene in Canada, with the writers such Larissa Lai, Evelyn Lau,  Denise Chong, Wayson Choy, Paul Yee, Jim Wong-Chu, and Vincent Lam all winning acclaim. In the world of film-making, Christina Wong, William Dere, Colleen Leung, Richard Fung, Dora Nipp, Tony Chan, Yung Chang Julia Kwan, Karin Lee, Mina Shum, Michelle Wong, Paul Wong, and Keith Lock have worked as directors and/or as script writers. The Confucian tradition emphasizing hard work, scholarship, self-discipline and learning has meant the Chinese Canadians families have strongly aspired for higher education and the 2001 census reported that over a quarter of Chinese Canadians had a university degree. As it was the Liberal government of Lester Pearson that liberalized the immigration system in 1967, Chinese Canadians tended to vote for the Liberals in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. In 1993, Raymond Chan became the first Chinese Canadian cabinet minister, and in 1999, Adrienne Clarkson became the first Chinese Canadian governor general.

=== 21st century ===
In the 21st century, Chinese immigration from Hong Kong has dropped sharply and the largest source of Chinese immigration are now from the mainland China. A smaller number have arrived from Taiwan and very small numbers from Fiji, French Polynesia, and New Zealand. Data from the 2006 census reveals that approximately 70% of Chinese Canadians reside in the Greater Vancouver or Greater Toronto areas.

On June 22, 2006, Prime Minister Stephen Harper delivered a message of redress in the House of Commons, offering an apology in Cantonese and compensation for the head tax once paid by Chinese immigrants. Survivors or their spouses will be paid approximately $20,000 CAD in compensation.

In December 2008, the Philippines passed China as Canada&#x27;s leading source of immigrants. In 2010, when Mainland China became the second largest economy in the world after the United States, its economic growth sparked even greater immigration opportunities to mainland Chinese. A 2011 survey shown that 60% of Chinese millionaires plan to immigrate, where 37% of the respondents wanted to immigrate to Canada. Many foreign countries such as Canada hold very large attraction for rich Chinese, because of their better social welfare system, higher quality of education and a greater opportunity for investment. The main reasons Chinese businesspeople want to move abroad was for some educational opportunities for their children, advanced medical treatment, worsening pollution back home (especially urban air quality) and food safety concerns. The Canadian Federal Investor Immigrant Program (FIIP) as a cash-for-visa scheme allows many powerful Chinese to seek for a Canadian citizenship, and recent reports show that 697 of the 700 (99.6%) of the applicants to this visa in 2011 were mainland Chinese. However, Canada—along with other English-speaking countries such as the United States and Australia—has increased its immigration requirements, forcing Chinese millionaires to seek permanent residency elsewhere.

The COVID-19 pandemic beginning in March 2020 led to a sharp increase in anti-Chinese sentiment worldwide, with Chinese people wrongly blamed for the virus. This resulted in widespread prejudice, evidenced by derogatory terms and hashtags in various countries. In Canada, a significant number of Chinese Canadians faced disrespect and harassment, with over 60% reporting disrespectful treatment and more than 30% experiencing threats or harassment. This rise in racism has also increased mental health concerns in the community. In response, Chinese Canadian groups have been actively working to track and combat this discrimination, providing ongoing support as the community navigates these challenges. As of September 2021, statistics from Project 1907 revealed a concerning 2,265 incidents of anti-Asian racism within Canada, surpassing the United States on a per capita basis by over 100%. This alarming trend, largely fueled by misplaced blame on the Asian community for the COVID-19 pandemic, has highlighted the urgent need for systemic change. In response to this challenging environment, the federal public service saw the formation of the Network of Asian Federal Employees (NAFE), an initiative aimed at addressing these issues and promote inclusivity.

==Demographics==
At the turn of the 20th century, the Chinese population in Canada was 17,312. From the years 1988 to 1993, 166,487 Hong Kong immigrants had settled in Canada.
In 2001, 25% of Chinese in Canada were Canadian-born.
During the same year, the Chinese population stood at 1,094,700 accounted for 3.5% of Canada&#x27;s total population. By 2006 the population stood at 1,346,510 comprising 4.3% of the Canadian population. StatsCan projects by 2031, the Chinese Canadian population is projected to reach between 2.4 and 3.0 million, constituting approximately 6 percent of the Canadian population. Much of the growth will be bolstered by sustained immigration as well as creating a younger age structure.

During the 2011 census in Canada, it was estimated that 1,324,700 individuals of pure Chinese origin resided in Canada. This number increased to 1,487,000 individuals, when including those of both pure Chinese origin and people of partial Chinese ancestry (meaning, individuals with both Chinese and some other racial and ethnic origin) during the 2011 census in Canada.

Most of the Chinese Canadian community is concentrated within the provinces of British Columbia and Ontario. The five metropolitan areas with the largest Chinese-Canadian populations are the Greater Toronto Area (631,050), Metro Vancouver (474,655), Greater Montreal (89,400), Calgary Region (89,675) and the Edmonton Metropolitan Region (60,200). The Chinese are the largest visible minority group in Alberta and British Columbia, and are the second largest in Ontario. The highest concentration of Chinese Canadians is in Vancouver and Richmond (British Columbia), where they constitute the largest ethnic group by country, and one in five residents are Chinese.

The province of Saskatchewan has a growing Chinese community, at over one percent as of 2006, mainly in the city of Saskatoon (2.1%), the province&#x27;s largest city, and to a lesser extent, Regina (1.9%), the capital of the province. The Riversdale neighbourhood of Saskatoon has a historical Chinese settlement dating back to the early 1900s, where Chinese immigrants were employed by the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, and established businesses within this district. Riversdale is currently home to many Chinese restaurants and stores. Chinese are the largest visible minority group in Saskatchewan.

According to the 2011 census by Statistics Canada, the Chinese Canadian population was approximately 1.4 million. In the 2016 census, individuals identifying as of Chinese ethnic origin comprised approximately 4.6% of the Canadian population, totaling to around 1.57 million people. By the 2021 Canadian census, the Chinese Canadian community increased to 1.71 million.

== Geographical distribution ==
Data from this section from Statistics Canada, 2021.

=== Provinces &amp; territories ===
Canadian metropolitan areas with large Chinese populations:

===Language===

In 2001, 87% of Chinese reported having a conversational knowledge of at least one official language, while 15% reported that they could speak neither English nor French. Of those who could not speak an official language, 50% immigrated to Canada in the 1990s, while 22% immigrated in the 1980s. These immigrants tended to be in the older age groups. Of prime working-age Chinese immigrants, 89% reported knowing at least one official language.

In 2001, collectively, the varieties of Chinese are the third-most common reported mother tongue, after English and French. 3% of the Canadian population, or 872,000 people, reported the Chinese language as their mother tongue—the language that they learned as a child and still understand. The most common Chinese mother tongue is Cantonese. Of these people, 44% were born in Hong Kong, 27% were born in Guangdong Province in China, and 18% were Canadian-born. The second-most common reported Chinese mother tongue was Mandarin. Of these people, 85% were born in either Mainland China or Taiwan, 7% were Canadian-born, and 2% were born in Malaysia. However, only about 790,500 people reported speaking Chinese at home on a regular basis, 81,900 fewer than those who reported having a Chinese mother tongue. This suggests some language loss has occurred, mainly among the Canadian-born who learned Chinese as a child, but who may not speak it regularly or do not use it as their main language at home.

====Census data====
Some varieties may be underreported due to respondents simply responding &quot;Chinese&quot; rather than specifying:

==Immigration==
As of 2001, almost 75% of the Chinese population in Canada lived in either Vancouver or Toronto. The Chinese population was 17% in Vancouver and 9% in Toronto. More than 50% of the Chinese immigrants who just arrived in 2000/2001 reported that their reason for settling in a given region was because their family and friends already lived there.

The economic growth of mainland China since the turn of the 21st century has sparked even greater emigration opportunities for mainland Chinese. A 2011 survey showed that 60% of Chinese millionaires planned to emigrate, where 37% of the respondents wanted to emigrate to Canada. The main reasons Chinese businesspeople wanted to move abroad was for greater educational opportunities for their children, advanced medical treatment, worsening pollution back home (especially urban air quality), concerns of political instability and food safety concerns. The Canadian Immigrant Investor Program (CANIIP) allows many wealthy Chinese to qualify for Canadian citizenship: among the 700 applicants to this program in 2011, 697 (99.6%) were mainland Chinese. In addition, many Chinese immigrants to Canada apply through the provincial nominee program, which requires immigrants to invest in a business in the province in which they settle.

==Socioeconomics==
In 2001, 31% of Chinese in Canada, both foreign-born and Canadian-born, had a university education, compared with the national average of 18%.

Of prime working-age Chinese in Canada, about 20% were in sales and services; 20% in business, finance, and administration; 16% in natural and applied sciences; 13% in management; and 11% in processing, manufacturing, and utilities. However, there is a trend that Chinese move toward small towns and rural areas for agricultural and agri-food operations in recent years.

Chinese who immigrated to Canada in the 1990s and were of prime working-age in 2001 had an employment rate of 61%, which was lower than the national average of 80%. Many reported that the recognition of foreign qualifications was a major issue. However, the employment rate for Canadian-born Chinese men of prime working-age was 86%, the same as the national average. The employment rate for Canadian-born Chinese women of prime working-age was 83%, which was higher than the national average of 76%.

==Religion==
Generational differences are also evident regarding religious practice and affiliation within this population group.

Among Toronto&#x27;s early Chinese immigrants especially, the church body was an important structure serving as a meeting place, hall and leisure club. Even today, over 30 churches in Toronto continue to hold Chinese congregations.

Christianity reached its peak of popularity in the early 1960s, with the 1961 census still reporting that 60% of the Chinese declared themselves Christians. Over the following 40 years Christianity has been steadily declining both among Canadian-born Chinese and new immigrants. Religiousy, the Chinese-Canadian community is different from the broader Canadian population in that about half of Chinese Canadians reportedly practise Chinese folk religion.

In 2001, 56% of Chinese Canadians aged 15 and over said that they did not have any religious affiliation, compared with the national average of 17%. As a result, Chinese Canadians make up 13% of all Canadians who did not report a religious affiliation despite making up 4% of the population. Among Chinese Canadians, 14% were Buddhist, 14% were Catholic and 9% belonged to a Protestant denomination.

==Cultural adjustment and assimilation==
According to the Canadian Ethnic Diversity Survey conducted in 2002, 76% of Canadians of Chinese origin said they had a strong sense of belonging to Canada; at the same time, 58% said that they had a strong sense of belonging to their ethnic or cultural group. Canadians of Chinese origin are also active in Canadian society; 64% of Chinese Canadians who were eligible to vote reported doing so in the 2000 federal election, while 60% said they voted in the 1996 provincial election. About 35% reported that they had participated in an organization such as a sports team or community association in the 12 months preceding the survey. 34% of Chinese Canadians also reported that in the past five years, or since they came to Canada, they have suffered discrimination, prejudice or unfair treatment, mainly from Anglo-Saxons. Most people who have experienced discrimination said that they thought it was based on Anglo-Saxon malice, while 42% believed that discrimination occurred at work or when applying for a job or promotion.

Most Canadian-born Chinese during the 1970s and 1980s were descended from immigrants of Hong Kong, while more recent Canadian-born Chinese come from mainland Chinese immigrants. Most Chinese Canadians born in Canada who have assimilated into Canadian society identify as solely Canadian while those born overseas and immigrated to Canada later in life primarily identify as a mixture of both Chinese and Canadian. In Canada, strong feelings of ethnic heritage are bolstered by the clustering of immigrant communities in large urban centres, especially because new immigrants tend to associate almost exclusively with people of the same culture due to unfamiliarity to the new mainstream culture. Canadians of Chinese origin, particularly the second generation and beyond, tend to have more liberal and Western style beliefs.

<text>Arthur Murray (born Moses Teichman; April 4, 1895 – March 3, 1991) was an American ballroom dancer and businessman, whose name is most often associated with the dance studio chain that bears his name.

==Early life and start in dance==

Arthur Murray was born in 1895 as Moses Teichman in Galicia, Austria-Hungary, to a family of Jewish background. In August 1897, he was brought to America by his mother Sarah on the &quot;S.S. Friesland&quot;, and landed at Ellis Island. They settled in Ludlow Street, in the Lower East Side of Manhattan with his father, Abraham Teichmann.

He soon began teaching ballroom dancing to patients from the greater Boston, area, at the Devereux Mansion Physical Therapy Clinic in Marblehead, Massachusetts, before moving to Asheville, North Carolina. Murray arrived at the Battery Park Hotel November 28, 1914, at age 19 and began teaching dance there. At the outbreak of World War I, under the pressure of the anti-German sentiment prevalent in the U.S., Murray changed his last name of Teichman to a less German-sounding name. The &quot;Asheville Citizen&quot; reported in 1920 that Murray had spent six summers teaching at the Battery Park. At that time, he had also begun his chain of dance studios and become a well-paid dance writer. He had also signed a deal to produce records for teaching dance for Columbia Gramophone Company. Murray released many successful dance records for Columbia as well as Capitol Records, some of which included coupons for dance lessons at Arthur Murray Studios.

In 1919, Murray began studying business administration at the Georgia School of Technology, and taught ballroom dancing in Atlanta at the Georgian Terrace Hotel. In 1920, he organized the world&#x27;s first &quot;radio dance&quot;; a band on the Georgia Tech campus played &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Wreck from Georgia Tech&quot; and other songs, which were broadcast to a group of about 150 dancers (mostly Tech students) situated atop the roof of the Capital City Club in downtown Atlanta. He graduated from Georgia School of Technology in 1923.

On April 24, 1925, Murray married his famous dance partner, Kathryn Kohnfelder (September 15, 1906, Jersey City, New Jersey – August 6, 1999, Honolulu, Hawaii), whom he had met at a radio station in New Jersey. She had been in the audience while he was broadcasting a dance lesson.

==The start of Arthur Murray Studios==

After WWII, Murray&#x27;s business grew with the rise of interest in Latin dance, and he regularly taught and broadcast in Cuba in the 1950s. Murray went on television with a dance program hosted by his wife, Kathryn; &quot;The Arthur Murray Party&quot; ran from 1950 to 1960, on CBS, NBC, DuMont, ABC, and then on CBS. Among the Arthur Murray dance instructors in the early 1950s was future television evangelist D. James Kennedy, who won first prize in a nationwide dance contest. He appeared as a guest on the June 17, 1956, episode of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;.

The Murrays retired in 1964; but they continued to be active for some time, appearing as guests on the &quot;Dance Fever&quot; disco show in the late 1970s. By then, there were more than 3,560 dance studios bearing his name. In 2020, about 275 Arthur Murray Studios remained in operation. Arthur Murray Dance Studios claims to be the second-oldest franchised company (the first, A&amp;W Restaurants, began in 1919). In 2012, Arthur Murray Studios celebrated more than 100 years of teaching dance at over 270 Arthur Murray Dance Studios in 22 countries across the globe. These range from studios in Australia (where the prestigious Crows Nest and Parramatta Dance Studios are located) and throughout North America, South America, Europe and Asia.

==Death==
For many years, Murray had two homes – one in Honolulu and another in Rye, New York. He died at his Honolulu home at the age of 95; according to his daughter, Phyllis Murray McDowell, pneumonia was the cause of death. He had been active and in good health until a short time before his death.

==In popular culture==
Hal Borne and His Orchestra recorded the Mercer-Schertzing song in a Soundie released May 25, 1942, with the Three Murtah Sisters.

The name and franchise of Arthur Murray were prominently referenced in the popular song &quot;Arthur Murray Taught Me Dancing in a Hurry&quot;, published in 1942 by Johnny Mercer and Victor Schertzinger. The song was featured in the film &quot;The Fleet&#x27;s In&quot; and was covered by various artists, including the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra and Betty Hutton.

Arthur Murray is mentioned in Richard Brautigan&#x27;s book &quot;Dreaming of Babylon&quot;.

Arthur Murray and his dance lesson patterns are mentioned in Steve Goodman&#x27;s song, &quot;Would You Like To Learn To Dance?&quot;

Arthur Murray is mentioned in &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; movie as Johnny&#x27;s dance teacher.

<text>Kafir (; , , or ; ; or ) is an Arabic term in Islam which refers to a person who disbelieves the God in Islam, denies his authority, rejects the tenets of Islam, or simply is not a Muslim—one who does not believe in the guidance of Muhammad, the Islamic prophet.

&quot;Kafir&quot; is often translated as &#x27;infidel&#x27;, &#x27;pagan&#x27;, &#x27;rejector&#x27;, &#x27;denier&#x27;, &#x27;disbeliever&#x27;, &#x27;unbeliever&#x27;, &#x27;nonbeliever&#x27;, and &#x27;non-Muslim&#x27;. The term is used in different ways in the Quran, with the most fundamental sense being ungrateful toward God. &quot;Kufr&quot; means &#x27;disbelief&#x27;, &#x27;unbelief&#x27;, &#x27;non-belief&#x27;, &#x27;to be thankless&#x27;, &#x27;to be faithless&#x27;, or &#x27;ingratitude&#x27;. The opposite term of &quot;kufr&quot; (&#x27;disbelief&#x27;) is &quot;iman&quot; (&#x27;faith&#x27;), and the opposite of &quot;kafir&quot; (&#x27;disbeliever&#x27;) is &quot;mu&#x27;min&quot; (&#x27;believer&#x27;). A person who denies the existence of a creator might be called a dahri.

One type of &quot;kafir&quot; is a &quot;mushrik&quot; (مشرك), another group of religious wrongdoer mentioned frequently in the Quran and other Islamic works. Several concepts of vice are seen to revolve around the concept of &quot;kufr&quot; in the Quran. Historically, while Islamic scholars agreed that a &quot;mushrik&quot; was a &quot;kafir&quot;, they sometimes disagreed on the propriety of applying the term to Muslims who committed a grave sin or the People of the Book. The Quran distinguishes between &quot;mushrikūn&quot; and People of the Book, reserving the former term for idol worshippers, although some classical commentators considered the Christian doctrine to be a form of &quot;shirk&quot;.

In modern times, &quot;kafir&quot; is sometimes applied to self-professed Muslims, particularly by members of Islamist movements. The act of declaring another self-professed Muslim a &quot;kafir&quot; is known as &quot;takfir&quot;, a practice that has been condemned but also employed in theological and political polemics over the centuries.

A &quot;dhimmi&quot; or &quot;mu&#x27;ahid&quot; is a historical term for non-Muslims living in an Islamic state with legal protection. &quot;Dhimmis&quot; were exempt from certain duties specifically assigned to Muslims if they paid the &quot;jizya&quot; poll tax, but otherwise equal under the laws of property, contract, and obligation according to some scholars, whereas others state religious minorities subjected to the status of &quot;dhimmis&quot; (such as Hindus, Christians, Jews, Samaritans, Gnostics, Mandeans, and Zoroastrians) were inferior to the status of Muslims in Islamic states. Jews and Christians were required to pay the &quot;jizya&quot; and &quot;kharaj&quot; taxes, while others, depending on the different rulings of the schools of Islamic jurisprudence, might be required to convert to Islam, pay the &quot;jizya&quot;, exiled, or subject to the death penalty. 

In 2019, Nahdlatul Ulama, the world&#x27;s largest independent Islamic organization, issued a proclamation urging Muslims to refrain from using the word &quot;kafir&quot; to refer to non-Muslims because the term is both offensive and perceived as &quot;theologically violent&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word is the active participle of the verb , from root K-F-R. As a pre-Islamic term it described farmers burying seeds in the ground. One of its applications in the Quran has also the same meaning as farmer. Since farmers cover the seeds with soil while planting, the word implies a person who hides or covers. Ideologically, it implies a person who hides or covers the truth. Arabic poets personify the darkness of night as , perhaps as a survival of pre-Islamic Arabian religious or mythological usage.

The noun for &#x27;disbelief&#x27;, &#x27;blasphemy&#x27;, &#x27;impiety&#x27; rather than the person who disbelieves, is .

==In the Quran==
The distinction between those who believe in Islam and those who do not is made in the Quran. , and its plural , is used directly 134 times in Quran, its verbal noun is used 37 times, and the verbal cognates of are used about 250 times.

By extension of the basic meaning of the root, &#x27;to cover&#x27;, the term is used in the Quran in the senses of ignore/fail to acknowledge and to spurn/be ungrateful. The meaning of &#x27;disbelief&#x27;, which has come to be regarded as primary, retains all of these connotations in the Quranic usage. In the Quranic discourse, the term typifies all things that are unacceptable and offensive to God. Within the Quranic context, the term implies an active offense and often bears the connotation of &quot;ungratefulness&quot;. In Surah 26:19, the Pharao accuses Moses of being a kafir for being ungrateful to what he has done to him when Moses was a child. Likewise, Iblis (Satan) does not deny the existence of God, but is called a for rejecting God. According to Al-Damiri (1341–1405) it is neither denying God, nor the act of disobedience alone, but Iblis&#x27; attitude (claiming that God&#x27;s command is unjust), which makes him a . The most fundamental sense of in the Quran is &#x27;ingratitude&#x27;, the willful refusal to acknowledge or appreciate the benefits that God bestows on humankind, including clear signs and revealed scriptures.

According to the &quot;E. J. Brill&#x27;s First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913–1936, Volume 4&quot;, the term first applied in the Quran to unbelieving Meccans, who endeavoured &quot;to refute and revile the Prophet&quot;. A waiting attitude towards the was recommended at first for Muslims; later, Muslims were ordered to keep apart from unbelievers and defend themselves against their attacks and even take the offensive. Most passages in the Quran referring to unbelievers in general talk about their fate on the day of judgement and destination in hell.

According to scholar Marilyn Waldman, as the Quran &quot;progresses&quot; (as the reader goes from the verses revealed first to later ones), the meaning behind the term does not change but &quot;progresses&quot;, i.e. &quot;accumulates meaning over time&quot;. As the Islamic prophet Muhammad&#x27;s views of his opponents change, his use of &quot;undergoes a development&quot;. moves from being description of Muhammad&#x27;s opponents to the primary one. Later in the Quran, becomes more and more connected with . Finally, towards the end of the Quran, begins to also signify the group of people to be fought by the (&#x27;believers&#x27;).

Khaled Abou El Fadl argues that Quran 2:62 supports religious pluralism, implying that some non-Muslims are not kafirs: &quot;Those who believe, Jews, Christians, Sabians --whoever believes in God and the Last Day and do good, will have their reward with their Lord and they will not fear, nor grieve.&quot; 

==Types of unbelievers==
===People of the Book===
Charles Adams writes that the Quran reproaches the People of the Book with for rejecting Muhammad&#x27;s message when they should have been the first to accept it as possessors of earlier revelations, and singles out Christians for disregarding the evidence of God&#x27;s unity. The Quranic verse (&quot;Certainly they disbelieve [] who say: God is the third of three&quot;), among other verses, has been traditionally understood in Islam as rejection of the Christian doctrine on the Trinity, though modern scholarship has suggested alternative interpretations. Other Quranic verses strongly deny the deity of Jesus Christ, son of Mary and reproach the people who treat Jesus as equal with God as disbelievers who will have strayed from the path of God which would result in the entrance of hellfire. While the Quran does not recognize the attribute of Jesus as the Son of God or God himself, it respects Jesus as a prophet and messenger of God sent to children of Israel. Some Muslim thinkers such as Mohamed Talbi have viewed the most extreme Quranic presentations of the dogmas of the Trinity and divinity of Jesus (, , ) as non-Christian formulas that were rejected by the Church.

On the other hand, modern scholarship has suggested alternative interpretations of verse Q.. Cyril Glasse criticizes the use of (plural of ) to describe Christians as &quot;loose usage&quot;. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Islam&quot;, in traditional Islamic jurisprudence, are &quot;usually regarded more leniently than other [plural of ]&quot; and &quot;in theory&quot; a Muslim commits a punishable offense if they say to a Jew or a Christian: &quot;Thou unbeliever&quot;. Charles Adams and A. Kevin Reinhart also write that &quot;later thinkers&quot; in Islam distinguished between &quot;ahl al-kitab&quot; and the polytheists/&quot;mushrikīn&quot;.

Historically, People of the Book permanently residing under Islamic rule were entitled to a special status known as , while those visiting Muslim lands received a different status known as .

===The Mushrikun===
The mushrikun are those who believe in shirk &#x27;association&#x27;, which refers to accepting other gods and divinities alongside God. The term is often translated as polytheist.

The Quran distinguishes between mushrikun and People of the Book, reserving the former term for idol worshipers, although some classical commentators considered Christian doctrine to be a form of shirk. Shirk is held to be the worst form of disbelief and it is identified in the Quran as the only sin that God will not pardon (, ).

Accusations of have been common in religious polemics within Islam. Thus, in the early Islamic debates on free will and theodicy, Sunni theologians charged their Mutazila adversaries with , accusing them of attributing to man creative powers comparable to those of God in both originating and executing actions. Mu&#x27;tazila theologians, in turn, charged the Sunnis with shirk because under their doctrine a voluntary human act results from an &quot;association&quot; between God, who creates the act, and the individual who appropriates it by carrying it out.

In classical jurisprudence, Islamic religious tolerance applied only to the People of the Book, while mushrikun, based on the Sword Verse, faced a choice between conversion to Islam and fight to the death, which may be substituted by enslavement. In practice, the designation of People of the Book and the dhimmī status was extended even to non-monotheistic religions of conquered peoples, such as Hinduism. Following destruction of major Hindu temples during the Muslim conquests in South Asia, Hindus and Muslims on the subcontinent came to share a number of popular religious practices and beliefs, such as veneration of Sufi saints and worship at Sufi dargahs, although Hindus may worship at Hindu shrines also.

In the 18th century, followers of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, known as Wahhabis, believed kufr or shirk was found in the Muslim community itself, especially in &quot;the practice of popular religion&quot;:
While ibn Abd al-Wahhab and the Wahhābīs were &quot;the best-known premodern&quot; revivalist and &quot;sectarian movement&quot; of that era, other revivalists included Shah Ismail Dehlvi and Ahmed Raza Khan Barelvi, leaders of the Mujāhidīn movement on the North-West frontier of India in the early 19th century.

===Sinners===
Whether a Muslim could commit a sin great enough to become a was disputed by jurists in the early centuries of Islam. The most tolerant view (that of the ) was that even those who had committed a major sin () were still believers and &quot;their fate was left to God&quot;. The most strict view (that of Kharidji Ibadis, descended from the Kharijites) was that every Muslim who dies having not repented of their sins was considered a . In between these two positions, the believed that there was a status between believer and unbeliever called &quot;rejected&quot; or .

The Kharijites&#x27; view that the self-proclaimed Muslim who had sinned and &quot;failed to repent had ipso facto excluded himself from the community, and was hence a &quot; (a practice known as ) was considered so extreme by the Sunni majority that they in turn declared the Kharijites to be , following the hadith that declared, &quot;If a Muslim charges a fellow Muslim with , he is himself a if the accusation should prove untrue&quot;.

Nevertheless, in Islamic theological polemics was &quot;a frequent term for the Muslim protagonist&quot; holding the opposite view, according to &quot;Brill&#x27;s Islamic Encyclopedia&quot;.

Present-day Muslims who make interpretations that differ from what others believe are declared ; (edicts by Islamic religious leaders) are issued ordering Muslims to kill them, and some such people have been killed also.
Another group that are &quot;distinguished from the mass of &quot; are the , or apostate ex-Muslims, who are considered renegades and traitors. Their traditional punishment is death, even, according to some scholars, if they recant their abandonment of Islam.
 are non-Muslims living under the protection of an Islamic state. are exempt from certain duties assigned specifically to Muslims if they paid the poll tax () but were otherwise equal under the laws of property, contract, and obligation according to some scholars, whereas others state that religious minorities subjected to the status of (such as Jews, Samaritans, Gnostics, Mandeans, and Zoroastrians) were inferior to the status of Muslims in Islamic states. Jews and Christians were required to pay the while pagans, depending on the different rulings of the four , might be required to accept Islam, pay the jizya, be exiled, or be killed under the Islamic death penalty. Some historians believe that forced conversion was rare in Islamic history, and most conversions to Islam were voluntary. Muslim rulers were often more interested in conquest than conversion.

Upon payment of the tax (), the would receive a receipt of payment, either in the form of a piece of paper or parchment or as a seal humiliatingly placed upon their neck, and was thereafter compelled to carry this receipt wherever they went within the realms of Islam. Failure to produce an up-to-date receipt on the request of a Muslim could result in death or forced conversion to Islam of the in question.

==Types of disbelief==
Various types of unbelief recognized by legal scholars include:
* (verbally expressed unbelief)
* (unbelief expressed through action)
* (unbelief of convictions)
* (major unbelief)
* (minor unbelief)
* (general charge of unbelief, i.e. charged against a community like ahmadiyya
* (charge of unbelief against a particular individual)
* (charge of unbelief against &quot;rank and file Muslims&quot; for example following taqlid.
* (category covers general statements such as &#x27;whoever says X or does Y is guilty of unbelief&#x27;)
* (original unbelief of non-Muslims, those born to non-Muslim family)
* (acquired unbelief of formerly observant Muslims, i.e. apostates)

===Iman===
Muslim belief/doctrine is often summarized in &quot;the Six Articles of Faith&quot;, (the first five are mentioned together in the ).

# God
# His angels
# His Messengers
# His Revealed Books,
# The Day of Resurrection
# , Divine Preordainments, i.e. whatever God has ordained must come to pass

According to the Salafi scholar Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali, &quot; is basically disbelief in any of the articles of faith.&quot; He also lists several different types of major disbelief, (disbelief so severe it excludes those who practice it completely from the fold of Islam):

# : disbelief in divine truth or the denial of any of the articles of Faith (Quran 39:32)
# : refusing to submit to God&#x27;s Commandments after conviction of their truth (Quran 2:34)
# : doubting or lacking conviction in the six articles of Faith. (Quran 18:35–38)
# : turning away from the truth knowingly or deviating from the obvious signs which God has revealed. (Quran 46:3)
# : hypocritical disbelief (Quran 63:2–3)

Minor disbelief or indicates &quot;ungratefulness of God&#x27;s Blessings or Favours&quot;.

According to another source, a paraphrase of the by Ibn Kathir, there are eight kinds of (major unbelief), some are the same as those described by Al-Hilali (, ) and some different.

# : Disbelief out of stubbornness. This applies to someone who knows the Truth and admits to knowing the Truth, and knowing it with their tongue, but refuses to accept it and refrains from making a declaration.
# : Disbelief out of denial. This applies to someone who denies with both heart and tongue.
# : Disbelief out of rejection. This applies to someone who acknowledges the truth in their heart, but rejects it with their tongue. This type of is applicable to those who call themselves Muslims but who reject any necessary and accepted norms of Islam such as and .
# : Disbelief out of hypocrisy. This applies to someone who pretends to be a believer but conceals their disbelief. Such a person is called a or hypocrite.
# : Disbelief out of detesting any of God&#x27;s commands.
# : Disbelief due to mockery and derision.
# : Disbelief due to avoidance. This applies to those who turn away and avoid the truth.
# : Disbelief because of trying to substitute God&#x27;s Laws with man-made laws.

===Ignorance===
In Islam, (&#x27;ignorance&#x27;) refers to the time of Arabia before Islam.

==History of the usage of the term==
===Usage in the earliest sense===
When the Islamic empire expanded, the word was broadly used as a descriptive term for all pagans and anyone else who disbelieved in Islam.
Historically, the attitude toward unbelievers in Islam was determined more by socio-political conditions than by religious doctrine. A tolerance toward unbelievers &quot;impossible to imagine in contemporary Christendom&quot; prevailed even to the time of the Crusades, particularly with respect to the People of the Book. However, due to animosity towards Franks, the term developed into a term of abuse. During the Mahdist War, the Mahdist State used the term against Ottoman Turks, and the Turks themselves used the term towards Persians during the Ottoman-Safavid wars. In modern Muslim popular imagination, the (Antichrist-like figure) will have k-f-r written on his forehead.

However, there was extensive religious violence in India between Muslims and non-Muslims during the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire (before the political decline of Islam). In their memoirs on Muslim invasions, enslavement and plunder of this period, many Muslim historians in South Asia used the term for Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains. Raziuddin Aquil states that &quot;non-Muslims were often condemned as , in medieval Indian Islamic literature, including court chronicles, Sufi texts and literary compositions&quot; and were issued that justified persecution of the non-Muslims.

Relations between Jews and Muslims in the Arab world and use of the word were equally as complex, and over the last century, issues regarding have arisen over the conflict in Israel and Palestine. Calling the Jews of Israel, &quot;the usurping &quot;, Yasser Arafat turned on the Muslim resistance and &quot;allegedly set a precedent for preventing Muslims from mobilizing against &#x27;aggressor disbelievers&#x27; in other Muslim lands, and enabled &#x27;the cowardly, alien &#x27; to achieve new levels of intervention in Muslim affairs.&quot;

In 2019, Nahdlatul Ulama, the largest independent Islamic organization in the world, issued a proclamation urging Muslims to refrain from using the word to refer to non-Muslims, as the term is both offensive and perceived to be &quot;theologically violent&quot;.

====Muhammad&#x27;s parents====

According to Islamic sources, none of forefathers of Muhammad were . According to Ibn Hajar, the Quran clearly declares that Ahl al-Fatrah were among the Muslims. Ibn Hajar is of opinion that none of the Muhammad&#x27;s parents who were non-prophets were (disbelievers) and all the hadiths on this subject (although some hadiths seem to contradict it) mean that. Ibn Hajar says about Muhammad saying his is in the Hell, that the in the hadith refers to the paternal uncle and that Arabs widely use to refer to (paternal uncle). Most Sunni scholars hold the view that the parents of Muhammad are saved and inhabitants of Heaven.

Shia Muslim scholars likewise consider Muhammad&#x27;s parents to be in Paradise. In contrast, the Salafi website IslamQA.info, founded by the Saudi Arabian Salafi scholar Muhammad Al-Munajjid, argues that Islamic tradition teaches that Muhammad&#x27;s parents were (&#x27;disbelievers&#x27;) who are in Hell.

===Other uses===
By the 15th century, Muslims in Africa were using the word in reference to the non-Muslim African natives. Many of those were enslaved and sold to European and Asian merchants by their Muslim captors, most of the merchants were from Portugal, which had established trading outposts along the coast of West Africa by that time. These European traders adopted the Arabic word and its derivatives.

Some of the earliest records of European usage of the word can be found in &quot;The Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques and Discoveries of the English Nation&quot; (1589) by Richard Hakluyt. In volume 4, Hakluyt writes: &quot;calling them &quot;Cafars&quot; and &quot;Gawars&quot;, which is, infidels or disbelievers&quot;. Volume 9 refers to the slaves (slaves called &quot;Cafari&quot;) and inhabitants of Ethiopia (&quot;and they use to go in small shippes, and trade with the &quot;Cafars&quot;&quot;) by two different but similar names. The word is also used in reference to the coast of Africa as &quot;land of Cafraria&quot;. The 16th century explorer Leo Africanus described the &quot;Cafri&quot; as &quot;negroes&quot;, and he also stated that they constituted one of five principal population groups in Africa. He identified their geographical heartland as being located in a remote region of southern Africa, an area which he designated as &quot;Cafraria&quot;.

By the late 19th century, the word was in use in English-language newspapers and books. One of the Union-Castle Line ships operating off the South African coast was named SS . In the early 20th century, in his book &quot;The Essential&quot; , Dudley Kidd writes that the word had come to be used for all dark-skinned South African tribes. Thus, in many parts of South Africa, became synonymous with the word &quot;native&quot;. Currently in South Africa, however, the word &quot;kaffir&quot; is regarded as a racial slur, applied pejoratively or offensively to blacks.

The song &quot;Kafir&quot; by the American technical death metal band Nile on its sixth album &quot;Those Whom the Gods Detest&quot; uses the violent attitudes that Muslim extremists have towards as subject matter.

The Nuristani people were formerly known as the Kaffirs of Kafiristan before the Afghan Islamization of the region.

The Kalash people who live in the Hindu Kush mountain range which is located south west of Chitral are referred to as by the Muslim population of Chitral.

In modern Spanish, the word , derived from the Arabic word by way of the Portuguese language, also means &#x27;uncouth&#x27; or &#x27;savage&#x27;.

<text>Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement or maintenance of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people. Health care is delivered by health professionals and allied health fields. Medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, midwifery, nursing, optometry, audiology, psychology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, athletic training, and other health professions all constitute health care. The term includes work done in providing primary care, , tertiary care, and public health.

Access to health care may vary across countries, communities, and individuals, influenced by social and economic conditions and health policies. Providing health care services means &quot;the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes&quot;. Factors to consider in terms of health care access include financial limitations (such as insurance coverage), geographical and logistical barriers (such as additional transportation costs and the ability to take paid time off work to use such services), sociocultural expectations, and personal limitations (lack of ability to communicate with health care providers, poor health literacy, low income). Limitations to health care services affect negatively the use of medical services, the efficacy of treatments, and overall outcome (well-being, mortality rates).

Health systems are the organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a well-functioning health care system requires a financing mechanism, a well-trained and adequately paid workforce, reliable information on which to base decisions and policies, and well-maintained health facilities to deliver quality medicines and technologies.

An efficient health care system can contribute to a significant part of a country&#x27;s economy, development, and industrialization. Health care is an important determinant in promoting the general physical and mental health and well-being of people around the world. An example of this was the worldwide eradication of smallpox in 1980, declared by the WHO, as the first disease in human history to be eliminated by deliberate health care interventions.

==Delivery==
The delivery of modern health care depends on groups of trained professionals and paraprofessionals coming together as interdisciplinary teams. This includes professionals in medicine, psychology, physiotherapy, nursing, dentistry, midwifery and allied health, along with many others such as public health practitioners, community health workers and assistive personnel. These professionals systematically provide personal and population-based preventive, curative and rehabilitative care services.

While the definitions of the various types of health care vary based on the different cultural, political, organizational, and disciplinary perspectives, there is general consensus that primary care constitutes the first element of a continuous health care process and may also include the provision of secondary and tertiary levels of care. Health care can be defined as either public or private.
===Primary care===


Primary care refers to the work of health professionals who act as a first point of consultation for all patients within the health care system. The primary care model supports first-contact, accessible, continuous, comprehensive and coordinated person-focused care. Such a professional would usually be a primary care physician, such as a general practitioner or family physician. Another professional would be a licensed independent practitioner such as a physiotherapist, or a non-physician primary care provider such as a physician assistant or nurse practitioner. Depending on the locality and health system organization, the patient may see another health care professional first, such as a pharmacist or nurse. Depending on the nature of the health condition, patients may be referred for secondary or tertiary care.

Primary care is often used as the term for the health care services that play a role in the local community. It can be provided in different settings, such as Urgent care centers that provide same-day appointments or services on a walk-in basis.

Primary care involves the widest scope of health care, including all ages of patients, patients of all socioeconomic and geographic origins, patients seeking to maintain optimal health, and patients with all types of acute and chronic physical, mental and social health issues, including multiple chronic diseases. Consequently, a primary care practitioner must possess a wide breadth of knowledge in many areas. Continuity is a key characteristic of primary care, as patients usually prefer to consult the same practitioner for routine check-ups and preventive care, health education, and every time they require an initial consultation about a new health problem. The International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) is a standardized tool for understanding and analyzing information on interventions in primary care based on the reason for the patient&#x27;s visit.

Common chronic illnesses usually treated in primary care may include, for example, hypertension, diabetes, asthma, COPD, depression and anxiety, back pain, arthritis or thyroid dysfunction. Primary care also includes many basic maternal and child health care services, such as family planning services and vaccinations. In the United States, the 2013 National Health Interview Survey found that skin disorders (42.7%), osteoarthritis and joint disorders (33.6%), back problems (23.9%), disorders of lipid metabolism (22.4%), and upper respiratory tract disease (22.1%, excluding asthma) were the most common reasons for accessing a physician.

In the United States, primary care physicians have begun to deliver primary care outside of the managed care (insurance-billing) system through direct primary care which is a subset of the more familiar concierge medicine. Physicians in this model bill patients directly for services, either on a pre-paid monthly, quarterly, or annual basis, or bill for each service in the office. Examples of direct primary care practices include Foundation Health in Colorado and Qliance in Washington.

In the context of global population aging, with increasing numbers of older adults at greater risk of chronic non-communicable diseases, rapidly increasing demand for primary care services is expected in both developed and developing countries. The World Health Organization attributes the provision of essential primary care as an integral component of an inclusive primary health care strategy.

===Secondary care===

Secondary care includes acute care: necessary treatment for a short period of time for a brief but serious illness, injury, or other health condition. This care is often found in a hospital emergency department. Secondary care also includes skilled attendance during childbirth, intensive care, and medical imaging services.

The term &quot;secondary care&quot; is sometimes used synonymously with &quot;hospital care&quot;. However, many secondary care providers, such as psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, most dental specialties or physiotherapists, do not necessarily work in hospitals. Some primary care services are delivered within hospitals. Depending on the organization and policies of the national health system, patients may be required to see a primary care provider for a referral before they can access secondary care.

In countries that operate under a mixed market health care system, some physicians limit their practice to secondary care by requiring patients to see a primary care provider first. This restriction may be imposed under the terms of the payment agreements in private or group health insurance plans. In other cases, medical specialists may see patients without a referral, and patients may decide whether self-referral is preferred.

In other countries patient self-referral to a medical specialist for secondary care is rare as prior referral from another physician (either a primary care physician or another specialist) is considered necessary, regardless of whether the funding is from private insurance schemes or national health insurance.

Allied health professionals, such as physical therapists, respiratory therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and dietitians, also generally work in secondary care, accessed through either patient self-referral or through physician referral.

===Tertiary care===

Tertiary care is specialized consultative health care, usually for inpatients and on referral from a primary or secondary health professional, in a facility that has personnel and facilities for advanced medical investigation and treatment, such as a tertiary referral hospital.

Examples of tertiary care services are cancer management, neurosurgery, cardiac surgery, plastic surgery, treatment for severe burns, advanced neonatology services, palliative, and other complex medical and surgical interventions.

=== Quaternary care ===
The term quaternary care is sometimes used as an extension of tertiary care in reference to advanced levels of medicine which are highly specialized and not widely accessed. Experimental medicine and some types of uncommon diagnostic or surgical procedures are considered quaternary care. These services are usually only offered in a limited number of regional or national health care centers.

===Home and community care===

Many types of health care interventions are delivered outside of health facilities. They include many interventions of public health interest, such as food safety surveillance, distribution of condoms and needle-exchange programs for the prevention of transmissible diseases.

They also include the services of professionals in residential and community settings in support of self-care, home care, long-term care, assisted living, treatment for substance use disorders among other types of health and social care services.

Community rehabilitation services can assist with mobility and independence after the loss of limbs or loss of function. This can include prostheses, orthotics, or wheelchairs.

Many countries are dealing with aging populations, so one of the priorities of the health care system is to help seniors live full, independent lives in the comfort of their own homes. There is an entire section of health care geared to providing seniors with help in day-to-day activities at home such as transportation to and from doctor&#x27;s appointments along with many other activities that are essential for their health and well-being. Although they provide home care for older adults in cooperation, family members and care workers may harbor diverging attitudes and values towards their joint efforts. This state of affairs presents a challenge for the design of ICT (information and communication technology) for home care.

Because statistics show that over 80 million Americans have taken time off of their primary employment to care for a loved one, many countries have begun offering programs such as the Consumer Directed Personal Assistant Program to allow family members to take care of their loved ones without giving up their entire income.

With obesity in children rapidly becoming a major concern, health services often set up programs in schools aimed at educating children about nutritional eating habits, making physical education a requirement and teaching young adolescents to have a positive self-image.

===Ratings===

Health care ratings are ratings or evaluations of health care used to evaluate the process of care and health care structures and/or outcomes of health care services. This information is translated into report cards that are generated by quality organizations, nonprofit, consumer groups and media. This evaluation of quality is based on measures of:
* health plan quality
* hospital quality
* of patient experience
* physician quality
* quality for other health professionals

==Access to health care==

Access to health care may vary across countries, communities, and individuals, influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies. Providing health care services means &quot;the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes&quot;. Factors to consider in terms of health care access include financial limitations (such as insurance coverage), geographical and logistical barriers (such as additional transportation costs and the ability to take paid time off work to use such services), sociocultural expectations, and personal limitations (lack of ability to communicate with health care providers, poor health literacy, low income). Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services, the efficacy of treatments, and overall outcome (well-being, mortality rates).

==Related sectors==
Health care extends beyond the delivery of services to patients, encompassing many related sectors, and is set within a bigger picture of financing and governance structures.

===Health system===

A health system, also sometimes referred to as health care system or healthcare system, is the organization of people, institutions, and resources that deliver health care services to populations in need.

===Industry===

The healthcare industry incorporates several sectors that are dedicated to providing health care services and products. As a basic framework for defining the sector, the United Nations&#x27; International Standard Industrial Classification categorizes health care as generally consisting of hospital activities, medical and dental practice activities, and &quot;other human health activities.&quot; The last class involves activities of, or under the supervision of, nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, scientific or diagnostic laboratories, pathology clinics, residential health facilities, patient advocates or other allied health professions.

In addition, according to industry and market classifications, such as the Global Industry Classification Standard and the Industry Classification Benchmark, health care includes many categories of medical equipment, instruments and services including biotechnology, diagnostic laboratories and substances, drug manufacturing and delivery.

For example, pharmaceuticals and other medical devices are the leading high technology exports of Europe and the United States. The United States dominates the biopharmaceutical field, accounting for three-quarters of the world&#x27;s biotechnology revenues.

===Research===
The quantity and quality of many health care interventions are improved through the results of science, such as advanced through the medical model of health which focuses on the eradication of illness through diagnosis and effective treatment. Many important advances have been made through health research, biomedical research and pharmaceutical research, which form the basis for evidence-based medicine and evidence-based practice in health care delivery. Health care research frequently engages directly with patients, and as such issues for whom to engage and how to engage with them become important to consider when seeking to actively include them in studies. While single best practice does not exist, the results of a systematic review on patient engagement suggest that research methods for patient selection need to account for both patient availability and willingness to engage.

Health services research can lead to greater efficiency and equitable delivery of health care interventions, as advanced through the social model of health and disability, which emphasizes the societal changes that can be made to make populations healthier. Results from health services research often form the basis of evidence-based policy in health care systems. Health services research is also aided by initiatives in the field of artificial intelligence for the development of systems of health assessment that are clinically useful, timely, sensitive to change, culturally sensitive, low-burden, low-cost, built into standard procedures, and involve the patient.

===Financing===

There are generally five primary methods of funding health care systems:
# General taxation to the state, county or municipality
# Social health insurance
# Voluntary or private health insurance
# Out-of-pocket payments
# Donations to health charities

In most countries, there is a mix of all five models, but this varies across countries and over time within countries. Aside from financing mechanisms, an important question should always be how much to spend on health care. For the purposes of comparison, this is often expressed as the percentage of GDP spent on health care. In OECD countries for every extra $1000 spent on health care, life expectancy falls by 0.4 years. A similar correlation is seen from the analysis carried out each year by Bloomberg. Clearly this kind of analysis is flawed in that life expectancy is only one measure of a health system&#x27;s performance, but equally, the notion that more funding is better is not supported.

In the United States, the healthcare industry accounts for 18% of gross domestic product in 2020 and is one of the largest and most complex parts of the U.S. economy. In 2011, the health care industry consumed an average of 9.3 percent of the GDP or US$ 3,322 (PPP-adjusted) per capita across the 34 members of OECD countries. The US (17.7%, or US$ PPP 8,508), the Netherlands (11.9%, 5,099), France (11.6%, 4,118), Germany (11.3%, 4,495), Canada (11.2%, 5669), and Switzerland (11%, 5,634) were the top spenders, however life expectancy in total population at birth was highest in Switzerland (82.8 years), Japan and Italy (82.7), Spain and Iceland (82.4), France (82.2) and Australia (82.0), while OECD&#x27;s average exceeds 80 years for the first time ever in 2011: 80.1 years, a gain of 10 years since 1970. The US (78.7 years) ranges only on place 26 among the 34 OECD member countries, but has the highest costs by far. All OECD countries have achieved universal (or almost universal) health coverage, except the US and Mexico. (see also international comparisons.)

In the United States, where around 18% of GDP is spent on health care, the Commonwealth Fund analysis of spend and quality shows a clear correlation between worse quality and higher spending.

* Click the table tab at the source to get 3 lists (one after another) of amounts by country: &quot;Total&quot;, &quot;Government/compulsory&quot;, and &quot;Voluntary&quot;.



===Administration and regulation===

The management and administration of health care is vital to the delivery of health care services. In particular, the practice of health professionals and the operation of health care institutions is typically regulated by national or state/provincial authorities through appropriate regulatory bodies for purposes of quality assurance. Most countries have credentialing staff in regulatory boards or health departments who document the certification or licensing of health workers and their work history.

===Health information technology===

Health information technology (HIT) is &quot;the application of information processing involving both computer hardware and software that deals with the storage, retrieval, sharing, and use of health care information, data, and knowledge for communication and decision making.&quot;

Health information technology components:

<doc id="261926" wikidata="Q13730" url="?curid=261926" title="Aurora (province)">
<text>Aurora, officially the Province of Aurora (; ), is a province in the Philippines located in the eastern part of Central Luzon region, facing the Philippine Sea. Its capital is Baler and borders, clockwise from the south, the provinces of Quezon, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino, and Isabela. Maria Aurora is the only landlocked town in the province and yet, the most populous. It is the only province in Central Luzon that has no chartered cities.

Before 1979, Aurora was part of the province of Quezon. Aurora was, in fact, named after Aurora Aragon, the wife of Manuel L. Quezon, the president of the Philippine Commonwealth, after whom the mother province was named.

== History ==
=== Spanish colonial era ===
In 1572, the Spanish explorer Juan de Salcedo became the first European to visit the region that would be known as Aurora while he was exploring the northern coast of Luzon. Salcedo reportedly visited the towns of Casiguran, Baler and Infanta. Baler &amp; Casiguran were part of La Provincia de La Pampanga, which also included Pampanga, Bulacan, and Tarlac, and in 1591, the towns became part of Kalilayan, which included Nueva Ecija, until Kalilayan changed its name to Tayabas in 1749, taken from the town of the same name.

In the early days of the Spanish colonial period, Aurora was ecclesiastically linked to Infanta, which today rests further south, in northern Quezon. The earliest missionaries in the province were the Franciscans, who had established missions in Baler and Casiguran in 1609. Due to lack of available personnel, the region was given to the jurisdiction of the Augustinians and Recollects in 1658, but was returned to the Friars Minor in 1703. Other early missions included Dipaculao, established in 1719, and Casiguran, in 1753.
In 1705, the Military Comandancia of Nueva Ecija was created and was governed by Governor-General Fausto Cruzat y Góngora. It included huge swathes of Central Luzon, the Contracosta towns, as well as the Kalilayan area and Polillo Islands, however Nueva Ecija was still part of La Pampanga province at that time. Contracosta was the Spanish colonial name for the towns on the east coast and included towns from Mauban, Binangonan de Lampon, to El Principe. Since Contracosta &amp; Kalilayan were part of La Laguna province at that time before including them in Nueva Ecija, they became jointly ruled by La Pampanga &amp; La Laguna provinces. Contracosta and Tayabas area became jointly ruled by Tayabas and Pampanga when Tayabas became independent from La Laguna in 1754. When Rafael María de Aguilar y Ponce de León took over as Governor-General of the Philippines, he decreed the separation of the military- district of Nueva Ecija from the province of Pampanga and became a regular province on April 25, 1801, including the town of Baler, acquired from Tayabas.
In 1818, Nueva Ecija annexed the towns of Palanan from Isabela, as well as Baler, Casiguran, Infanta (formerly called Binangonan de Lampon) and Polillo Islands from Tayabas, and Cagayan, Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino, and part of Rizal. In 1853, the new military district of Tayabas was separated from Nueva Ecija and included present-day Southern Quezon as well as present-day Aurora. In 1858, Binangonan de Lampon and the Polillo Islands were separated from Nueva Ecija to form part of Infanta. Between 1855 and 1885, El Principe was established as its own Military Comandancia with its capital in Baler.

=== American colonial era ===


==== District of El Principe ====
The early history of Aurora is linked to Quezon province, of which it formed a part, and Nueva Ecija, under which the area was governed as the District of El Príncipe. In 1902, the district was separated from Nueva Ecija and transferred to the province of Tayabas (now Quezon). The provincial capital of Tayabas was already transferred from Tayabas to Lucena on March 12, 1901, a year before the transfer of El Príncipe. The northern area which is part of the modern Dilasag and area of modern Casiguran was part of Nueva Vizcaya and also transferred to Tayabas in 1905. In 1918, the area of modern Aurora north of Baler was transferred to the authority of Nueva Vizcaya, but returned to Tayabas in 1921 and in 1942, the entire present-day territory of Aurora was annexed from Tayabas to Nueva Ecija, and returned to Tayabas in 1945 until the time when Tayabas was renamed to &quot;Quezon&quot; in 1946. This was named in honor of Manuel Quezon who was the second President of the Philippines and elected governor of Tayabas in 1906 and congressman of 1st district of Tayabas in 1907 born and raised in Baler, formerly one of the towns of the province.

=== World War II ===
In 1942, invading Japanese forces landed in the town of Casiguran. On February 19, 1945, to May 11, 1945, Allied troops as well as Philippine Commonwealth forces and recognized guerrilla units fought on the Battle of Casiguran during the return of American forces on Luzon on World War II.

=== Postwar era ===
During the postwar years, there were several attempts to make Aurora independent from the rest of Quezon Province. One obvious reason was the area&#x27;s isolation from the rest of Quezon Province: there were no direct links to the rest of the province and much of the terrain was mountainous and heavily forested, which made the area relatively isolated, and its distance from Quezon&#x27;s capital Lucena. Independence from Quezon also meant that Aurora would belong in the Central Luzon region, in keeping with its precolonial history, rather than part of Southern Luzon.

Aurora became a sub-province of Quezon in 1951 through &quot;Republic Act No. 648&quot; under the presidency of Elpidio Quirino, after whom its neighboring province was named.

In 1978, the Lieutenant Governor of the Sub-Province Atty. Luis S. Etcubañez filed a Parliamentary Bill for the establishment of Aurora at the Interim Batasang Pambansa, leveraging his political ties with the various Assemblymen of Region IV. This led to a plebiscite in May 1979 to confirm the citizens of the Province&#x27;s willingness to separate from Quezon Province, and the eventual establishment of the province through &quot;Batas Pambansa Blg. 7&quot; on November 21, 1978.

==== 1968 Casiguran earthquake ====
On , the 1968 Casiguran earthquake, with a moment magnitude of 7.6 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (&quot;Violent&quot;), took place with an epicenter was in Casiguran. The quake generated a small non-destructive tsunami, but the majority of the 207 people killed during the quake were the result of the collapse of a six-story building in Manila.

=== During the Marcos dictatorship ===

The beginning months of the 1970s had marked a period of turmoil and change in the Philippines, as well as in Aurora. During his bid to be the first Philippine president to be re-elected for a second term, Ferdinand Marcos launched an unprecedented number of foreign debt-funded public works projects. This caused the Philippine economy to take a sudden downwards turn known as the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis, which led to a period of economic difficulty and a significant rise of social unrest. 

With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president, Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years. This period in Philippine history is remembered for the Marcos administration&#x27;s record of human rights abuses, particularly targeting political opponents, student activists, journalists, religious workers, farmers, and others who fought against the Marcos dictatorship.

One significant impact on the residents of Aurora, especially its farmers, was the administration&#x27;s practice of hamletting to achieve military control of the area. After the September 1972 declaration, Marcos forces were ordered into the province to achieve a military presence. But the New People&#x27;s Army (NPA) which was fighting them responded by establishing a presence of their own in Aurora&#x27;s mountainous areas. Despite the fact that the residents generally resisted invitations to join the NPA, the dictatorship troops told the residents that they were not allowed into the fields between four in the afternoon and seven in the morning. This made farming very difficult because people had to work in the fields during the hottest parts of the day.

Things took a more violent turn in the town of Dinalungan during the early 1980s, after farmers organized a rally against a landowner who attempted to claim their farms, seeking help and support from the nuns at the Carmelite mission that had been established there. However, the military accused the Carmelites of working with the NPA, and even hunted down the convent&#x27;s caretaker and one of the church workers. Young men started disappearing from the farms, and rumors begun to spread that they had been victims of extrajudicial killings by Marcos&#x27; forces. Much of the male population of Dinalungan began to disappear altogether, with some believed to be victims of the extrajudicial killings, and the rest forced to join the NPA because of the circumstances. The unrest persisted until the town was finally declared &quot;insurgency free&quot; in October 2018.

==== Birth of the surf tourism industry ====
One of the positive things that did happen to Aurora during the 1970s was the development of the surf tourism industry after the helicopter attack and surfing sequences of the film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; were filmed at Baler in 1976–77. The exposure of locals to the art of surfing during the production of the movie is credited with having sparked the surfing culture in Aurora and the Philippines.

==== Administrative assignment ====
Being originally part of the province of Quezon, Aurora was part of the Southern Tagalog Region (Region IV). Upon the issuance of Executive Order No. 103, dated May 17, 2002, by then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, the province of Aurora was moved to Central Luzon (Region III), the geographical location of the province. The provinces south of Aurora were reformed as Calabarzon and Mimaropa, and Southern Tagalog was limited to being a cultural-geographic region. The total separation of Aurora from Quezon, and the transfer of Aurora to Central Luzon were the fulfillment of the wishes and prayers of the residents of the original Municipalities of Baler and Casiguran to be truly independent from Quezon Province for the first time and to reform the original La Pampanga since the Spanish occupation. The transfer of Aurora to Central Luzon opened the access of Central Luzon to Pacific Ocean. Many residents and government leaders of Aurora objected to the change as Aurora maintains strong historical and cultural connections to the rest of Southern Tagalog, particularly Quezon Province, thus also of the memory of Manuel Quezon, and with that, Aurora residents self-identified with Quezon; but Aurora&#x27;s transfer to Central Luzon means that geographically, the province is more accessible by land from Nueva Ecija and of course, San Fernando, Pampanga, the regional capital of Central Luzon.

=== Contemporary ===

On April 22, 2024, newly installed Governor Reynante A. Tolentino took his oath of office as governor before his brother, Dipaculao Mayor Danilo A. Tolentino. He replaced Atty. Christian Noveras, who was dismissed by the Office of the Ombudsman along with his father, Vice Governor Gerardo Noveras, in December, 2023.

== Geography ==
Aurora is a coastal province covering an area of in east-central Luzon. To the north, it is bordered by the Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park of Isabela, to the west by the central range of the Sierra Madre which contains the Casecnan Protected Landscape and Aurora Memorial National Park, to the south by the Umiray River, and to the east by the Philippine Sea which opens to the Pacific Ocean. The San Ildefonso Peninsula lies in the province&#x27;s northern portion between the Philippine Sea and the Casiguran Sound.

=== Topography ===
The province covers a portion of the Sierra Madre mountain range. As such, the elevation is generally steep to very steep and only about 14% of the province&#x27;s total area is flat.

=== Climate ===
Aurora&#x27;s climate is classified as Tropical rainforest climate. It experiences significant rainfall throughout the year. Because the coastal province faces the Pacific Ocean, it is frequently visited by typhoons.

=== Administrative divisions ===

Aurora is politically subdivided into 8 municipalities, all encompassed by a lone legislative district.

Dilasag and Casiguran form the northern part of the province, while Dinalungan, Dipaculao, Maria Aurora, and Baler (the capital) make up the central portion. The southern half of the province consists of San Luis and Dingalan.

=== Barangays ===
The 8 municipalities of the province comprise a total of 151 barangays, with &quot;Suclayin&quot; in Baler as the most populous in 2010, and &quot;Dibalo&quot; in San Luis as the least.
== Demographics ==
The population of Aurora in the 2020 census was 235,750 people, with a density of .

Based on the 2000 census survey, Tagalogs comprised of the total provincial population of 173,589, and about less than 1/3 of the population were Ilocano at . Other ethnic groups in the province were Kasiguranin at , Bicolano at , Kankanaey at , Bisaya at , Dumagat (Umiray) at , and Cebuano at .

On the 2010 census survey, Tagalogs numbered 91,219, Ilocanos 67,861, Bicolano 14,250, Kankanaey 4,494, Bisaya 4,786, Umiray Dumagat 1,267, and Cebuano 1,777.

There are also pockets of Bugkalots &amp; Negritos, called Dumagats. Most Dumagats are living in the hillsides or mountains. They are believed to have result from a fusion of Austronesian and Melanesian ancestries, and survive from fishing and hunting. There are three kinds of Dumagats in Aurora province, the Umiray Dumagat, Casiguran Dumagat, and the Palanan Dumagat; minor Dumagat groups are called Southern Alta or Alta Kabulowan, Northern Alta or Edimala, and Tagabulós. Bugkalots are the second tribe indigenous to Aurora, most of them live in Dipaculao &amp; Maria Aurora.

Tagalogs, some originating from Palanan and Infanta, Quezon, came in to the area to trade by boat, some Tagalogs settled in Aurora (especially Baler) and married with the Aeta and Bugkalots. Kapampangans assimilated to the Tagalog settlers. The Spanish brought in Filipino acolytes from other areas of Luzon from 1609 to 1899. During this period, Baler can only be access by sea though the town saw increase migration from other parts of Luzon such as Laguna, Tayabas, and Bicol from the south. The opening of the Baler-Bongabon Road allowed easier migration of people from Ilocos and Isabela areas from the north. The road also allowed Igorot people and Batangueño Tagalogs to settle in Baler &amp; other places of Aurora. The majority of Igorots settled Dipaculao, Maria Aurora, &amp; Baler. In 1896, a group of Ilocanos from Aringay, La Union came to settle in San Jose, now called Maria Aurora; in 1906, another group of Ilocanos arrived from La Union and Pangasinan. In the early 1920s, Ilocano settlers from Central Luzon settled a Bugkalot territory Dipaculao, which in turn was derived from the phrase &quot;Dipac naulaw&quot; or &quot;Naulaw ni Dipac&quot;, the Ilocano for &quot;Dipac got dizzy&quot;, idiomatically &quot;Dipac is/got drunk&quot;, Dipac is the name of a Bugkalot chief; another group of Ilocano settlers arrived from La Union, Pangasinan, and other areas of Ilocos Region. The guerrilla movement during the Japanese occupation brought Novo Ecijanos (people from Nueva Ecija) to Baler; Novo Ecijanos include Tagalogs, Ilocanos, and Kapampangans, with quite large number of Pangasinenses. The Balereños learned trade from the Batangueños and the Novo Ecijanos; where before they used to share what they have, now they would sell coconut to their neighbors. Other ethnic groups who came and stayed in Aurora include Christianized Gaddang and Isinai settlers who settled the surrounding lowlands of Baler Bay. These ethnic groups who lived for several centuries &amp; left cultural influences &amp; legacies made Aurora the melting pot of the Central Luzon, next to Tarlac &amp; Nueva Ecija.

=== Languages ===

The Tagalog and Ilocano languages are spoken by their respective ethnic groups. The province primarily speaks a Tagalog dialect that is closely related to Tayabas Tagalog of Quezon with some Ilocano influences. In Baler, for example, the variety is called &quot;Tagalog-Baler (Balereño)&quot;. The &quot;Balereño&quot; is also known for distinctive expressions like &quot;akkaw&quot;, used to express surprise, wonder, disgust, and objection; it is also akin to the English term &quot;Wow!&quot; Other regional term expressions spoken in Baler are &quot;are (h)&quot;, used to express a negative feeling of surprise; &quot;anin&quot;, used to express regret or pity for a situation; and many other words are also spoken similarly to neighboring Quezon, like &quot;adyo&quot;, meaning to climb, and &quot;puropur&quot;, which pertain to rain with gusty wind. Ilocano is mostly spoken in northern areas of the province. The working population is ready in speech in the English language as well as in the Filipino language. Manuel L. Quezon, who was from Baler, was called the Father of the National Language for approving the recommendation of the Institute of National Language for Tagalog as the basis of the national language. Other languages spoken in Aurora are Kapampangan, and Pangasinan (in some areas of the province, most of which is in Baler) and Ga&#x27;dang &amp; Isinai in surrounding lowlands of Baler Bay, &amp; other languages native in Aurora are Casiguranin or Kasiguranin, spoken in Casiguran &amp; neighboring areas Dilasag &amp; Dinalungan where Casiguran Dumagat and Paranan Dumagat languages are also spoken, Umiray Dumagat spoken in San Luis and Dingalan, Southern Alta or Alta Kabulowan spoken in Dingalan, Northern Alta or Edimala spoken in Baler, Maria Aurora and San Luis, Tagabulós in Dingalan and San Luis, and Bugkalot spoken in Dipaculao, Maria Aurora, and Baler.

<doc id="261927" wikidata="Q7007240" url="?curid=261927" title="Commonwealth Coast Football">
<text>Commonwealth Coast Football (CCC Football) was a single-sport athletic conference that competed in football in the NCAA&#x27;s Division III. It began play as CCC Football in 2017 after the New England Football Conference (NEFC) was renamed following the 2016 season. CCC Football was administered by the Commonwealth Coast Conference, known since August 2024 as the Conference of New England.

The conference competed under the NEFC banner from 1965 through the 2016 season. Member teams are located in New England.

Before an NEFC conference split that took effect with the 2013 season, the NEFC was divided into the Boyd Division and the Bogan Division, with the division champions competing in Division III football&#x27;s only season-ending conference championship game.

After the 2012 season, the NEFC split, with the seven Massachusetts state institutions and Plymouth State playing in the MASCAC for football. The conference&#x27;s automatic bid to the NCAA Division III playoffs continued to be held by the eight remaining members: Curry, Endicott, Maine Maritime, MIT, Nichols, Salve Regina, Coast Guard, and Western New England. In the 12 seasons the NEFC hosted a championship game between its two division winners, these remaining eight members accounted for 16 of the 24 championship game participants and 8 of 12 conference champions.

The decision to rename the NEFC was made in October 2015, as the Commonwealth Coast Conference announced that it would add football by effectively absorbing the NEFC as a single-sport conference known as Commonwealth Coast Football, starting with the 2017–18 school year. Accordingly, the 2016 season was the last for the NEFC under its long-standing name and acronym.

The CCC and Commonwealth Coast Football unveiled a new family of logos during a June 2019 visual rebrand.

Due to changes in NCAA Division III legislation regarding the number of members required for a conference to receive an automatic qualifier (AQ), football was incorporated into the multi-sport Commonwealth Coast Conference in 2022, eliminating the need for the football-only league. As noted above, the multi-sports conference adopted its current name, Conference of New England, in 2024.

<text>The New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC) is an intercollegiate athletic conference that competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III comprising sports teams from eleven highly selective liberal arts institutions of higher education in the Northeastern United States. The eleven institutions are Amherst College, Bates College, Bowdoin College, Colby College, Connecticut College, Hamilton College, Middlebury College, Tufts University, Trinity College, Wesleyan University, and Williams College.

The conference originated with an agreement among Amherst, Bowdoin, Wesleyan and Williams in 1955. In 1971, Bates, Colby, Hamilton, Middlebury, Trinity, Tufts, and Union College joined on and the NESCAC was officially formed. Union withdrew in 1977 and was replaced by Connecticut College in 1982. Members of the conference have some of the largest financial endowments of any liberal arts colleges in the world, with Williams College&#x27;s $3.89 billion being the largest. Undergraduate enrollment at the schools ranges from about 1,800 (several institutions) to 6,000 (Tufts).

== History ==
Williams began its inaugural football season in 1881 and its rivalry with Amherst College is one of the longest at any level of college football. Bates and Bowdoin have competed against each other athletically since the 1870s and subsequently share one of the ten oldest NCAA Division III football rivalries, in the United States, there is a long history of athletic competition between the two colleges and Colby. Colby began its now most notable hockey rivalry, with Bowdoin in 1922.
In 1899, Amherst, Wesleyan and Williams schools first began to compete together as the &quot;Triangular League&quot;. Since then they have continued to play each other in most sports on a regular basis. The conference originated with an agreement among Amherst, Bowdoin, Wesleyan and Williams in 1955. Later, Bates, Colby, Connecticut College, Hamilton, Middlebury, Trinity, Tufts joined and the NESCAC was officially formed. The Conference was created out of a concern for the direction of intercollegiate athletic programs and remains committed to keeping a proper perspective on the role of sport in higher education.

Member institutions believe athletic teams should be representative of school&#x27;s entire student bodies and hew to NCAA Division III admissions and financial policies prohibiting athletic scholarships while awarding financial aid solely on the basis of need. Due to the prestigious reputations of its member schools, the NESCAC is able to attract many of the most athletically and intellectually gifted student-athletes in the country. Members stress that intercollegiate athletic programs should operate in harmony with the educational mission of each institution. Schools are committed to maintaining common boundaries to keep athletics strong yet in proportion to their overall academic mission. Presidents of each NESCAC institution control intercollegiate athletic policy. Conference tenets are usually more restrictive than those of the NCAA Division III regarding season length, number of contests and post-season competition.

Four NESCAC institutions are among the 39 that founded the NCAA in 1905: Amherst, Tufts, Wesleyan, and Williams. Prior to 1993 NESCAC generally did not allow member schools to send teams to NCAA championships. Since then all sports except football have had this freedom, many excelling in the NCAA Division III championships. The NACDA Directors&#x27; Cup, awarded since 1996 to the college or university in each NCAA Division that wins the most college championships, has been claimed at the Division III level by a NESCAC institution every year except 1998. In the 2012–13 season, four of the top ten NACDA Director&#x27;s Cup institutions were from NESCAC: Williams (1), Middlebury (3), Amherst (6), and Tufts (8).

===Chronological timeline===

As of the 2021-2022 academic year, Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, has the largest endowment of any college in the conference, followed closely by Amherst, and then Bowdoin and Tufts respectively. Admission to NESCAC institutions is often highly competitive, with most member schools touting acceptance rates lower than 15 percent as of the 2020-2021 admissions cycle. Many NESCAC schools are also some of the oldest institutions of higher education in the United States, with Williams, Bowdoin and Middlebury being among the 40 oldest institutions in the country.

== Academics ==

Many schools in the New England Small College Athletic Conference are known for low grade inflation, grade deflation, and rigorous academic standards. Some members have received limited media coverage over perceived grade inflation and deflation.

The colleges are also known for a range of high and relatively low tuition rates and comprehensive fees. Some of the colleges have been named the most expensive in the United States.

===Association of American Universities===
Tufts University is a member of the prestigious Association of American Universities.

=== Geographic distribution ===
Most applicants to schools in the NESCAC come from the Northeast, largely from the New York City, Boston, and Philadelphia areas. As all NESCAC schools are located on the East Coast, and all but one are in New England, most graduates end up working and residing in the Northeast after graduation.

==Spending and revenue==
Total revenue includes ticket sales, contributions and donations, rights/licensing, student fees, school funds, and all other sources including TV income, camp income, food, and novelties. Total expenses includes coaching/staff, buildings/grounds, maintenance, utilities and rental fees, and all other costs including recruiting, team travel, equipment and uniforms, conference dues, and insurance costs.

== Facilities ==
== Culture ==
Many colleges banned fraternities and sororities on the grounds of unwarranted exclusivity, and provided on-campus social houses for all students to engage with. Williams College displaced their fraternity system in the 1960s due to high levels of racial and religious discrimination. Williams College President Chandler stated, &quot;there remained the system of blackballing and secret agreements between some fraternities and their national bodies to exclude blacks and Jews... it was essentially a caste system based on socioeconomic status as perceived by students.&quot;

Bates rejected the fraternity system in 1855, when it was founded. Colby disbanded its fraternities and sororities in 1984. At Bowdoin, fraternities were phased out in 2000. Despite the lack of Greek life, NESCAC schools are widely known for a prominent drinking culture.

Schools within the NESCAC conference have made institutional efforts to diversify student body, and attract and wide range of students to their institutions. Many schools in the NESCAC provide significant financial aid to help increase the enrollment of lower income and middle class students.

=== Notable alumni ===

Schools in the New England Small College Athletic Conference have graduated three U.S. presidents. The first president to graduate from the athletic conference was Franklin Pierce, the 14th president of the United States, a Bowdoin graduate of 1824. The 20th president, James A. Garfield, graduated from Williams College in 1856. The third U.S. president to graduate from a NESCAC institution was Calvin Coolidge, who graduated from Amherst College in 1895. President Chester Arthur was an 1848 graduate of Union College, a former NESCAC member, and President Woodrow Wilson was a professor at Wesleyan from 1888 to 1890.

In addition to the ban on postseason play, the NESCAC football league is notable for member teams playing conference games only. While some Division II and Division III teams play only conference schedules, NESCAC is unique in all of its members playing only within conference games.

==Baseball==
NESCAC Baseball is the only men&#x27;s sport to utilize divisions. Bates, Bowdoin, Colby, Tufts, and Trinity compete in the East Division, while Amherst, Hamilton, Middlebury, Wesleyan, and Williams compete in the West Division. Connecticut College does not sponsor baseball.

The NESCAC has won the College World Series once: by the Trinity Bantams in 2008. Current member schools have appeared in the College World Series a combined total of 5 times.
