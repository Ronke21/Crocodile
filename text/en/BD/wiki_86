<text>The Tamar (; ) is a river in south west England that forms most of the border between Devon (to the east) and Cornwall (to the west). A large part of the valley of the Tamar is protected as the Tamar Valley National Landscape (an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty), and some is included in the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape (a World Heritage Site) due to its historic mining activities.

The Tamar&#x27;s source is less than from the north Cornish coast, but it flows southward across the peninsula to the south coast. The total length of the river is . At its mouth, the Tamar flows into the Hamoaze before entering Plymouth Sound, a bay in the English Channel. Tributaries of the river include the rivers Inny, Ottery, Kensey and Lynher (or &quot;St Germans River&quot;) on the Cornish side and the Deer and Tavy on the Devon side.

The name Tamar (or Tamare) was mentioned by Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD in his &quot;Geography&quot;. The name is said to mean &quot;great water&quot;. The Tamar is one of several British rivers whose ancient name is assumed by some to be derived from a prehistoric river word apparently meaning &quot;dark flowing&quot; and which it shares with the River Thames.

The seventh-century &quot;Ravenna Cosmography&quot; mentions a Roman settlement named Tamaris, but it is unclear to which of those towns along the Tamar this refers. Plymouth, Launceston and the Roman fort at Calstock have been variously suggested.

== Environment ==
The river (and/or land on its banks) is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), a European Special Area of Conservation, and an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. A part of it is also designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape.

In November 2013, South West Water was fined £50,000 after it admitted permitting the discharge of sewage from its Camels Head treatment plant into a tributary of the River Tamar for eight years.

=== Tamar Valley National Landscape===

Together, the Tamar, Tavy and Lynher form the Tamar Valley National Landscape, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The Tamar Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty covers around around the lower Tamar (below Launceston) and its tributaries the Tavy and the Lynher. It was first proposed in 1963, but was not designated until 1995. The highest point in the AONB is Kit Hill, 334 metres above sea level. The Tamar Discovery Trail is a 35-mile hiking route following the course of the Tamar through the valley.

=== Special Area of Conservation ===

The Plymouth Sound and Estuaries are a Special Area of Conservation. Rocky reefs in low salinity estuarine conditions far inland on the Tamar are very unusual and support species such as the hydroid &quot;Cordylophora caspia&quot;. The Tamar is one of a few estuaries where zonation of rocky habitats (intertidal and subtidal) can be observed along an estuarine gradient.

=== Site of Special Scientific Interest ===
The Tamar–Tavy Estuary is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) covering the tidal estuaries of the River Tamar and the River Tavy. Part of the Tamar estuary also forms the Tamar Estuary Nature Reserve, owned by the Cornwall Wildlife Trust. The site was designated in 1991 for its biodiversity and varying habitats that support a large number of wader and wildfowl species, as well as the special interest of its marine biology. The site supports a nationally important wintering population of avocet and supports species such as black-tailed godwit, Eurasian whimbrel, greenshank, spotted redshank, green sandpiper and golden plover.

=== UNESCO World Heritage Site ===

Throughout human history the valley has been almost continuously exploited for its rich mineral and metal deposits including silver, tin, lead and arsenic leaving a unique archaeological landscape which forms a significant part of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape. Remains include wheal or engine houses, deep and open cast mines dating from the Bronze Age through to the medieval and modern era, the export docks at Morwellham Quay were once an international centre of trade in copper, lead and arsenic. The valley, with the stannary town of Tavistock was added to the World Heritage List during the 30th Session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee in Vilnius, July 2006.

===Water quality===
The Environment Agency measures the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

== Geography ==


=== Sources ===

According to Ordnance Survey mapping, the source of the Tamar is at Woolley Moor, approximately from the north Cornish coast, at . The location of the spring is a &quot;high windswept plateau largely devoid of farmland, and inhabited by stunted trees and wiry undergrowth.&quot; The exact source of the river is difficult to pinpoint, because it arises &quot;from a boggy morass . . . behind a hedge near some willow trees at Woolley Barrows . . . A small square stone culvert drains the first tentative trickle of water away from the bog, through a hedge and into a ditch. From here a pipe carries the water under the highway and the infant river Tamar is on its way to the sea at Plymouth.&quot;

=== Reservoirs ===
The Upper Tamar Lake and Lower Tamar Lake are two small reservoirs on the Tamar&#x27;s upper course. The Lower Lake was constructed in the 1820s to feed the Bude Canal; it is now a nature reserve. The Upper Lake was constructed in the 1970s and supplies fresh water to the Bude area, as well as having some recreational use.

=== Border ===
The east bank of the Tamar was fixed as the border of Cornwall by King Athelstan in the year 936. Several villages north of Launceston, to the west of the Tamar, were transferred to Devon at some point in the eleventh century when the border was changed to follow the River Ottery westward, rather than the Tamar. The county boundary was restored to the Tamar in 1966, when the civil parishes of North Petherwin and Werrington were transferred from Devon to Cornwall. The Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844 ensured parishes were entirely within one county. It transferred a part of the Rame Peninsula (on the west side of the Hamoaze) from Devon to Cornwall (namely, parts of the parishes of Maker and St John). The Act also transferred part of the parish of Bridgerule to Devon and part of the parish of North Tamerton to Cornwall — these latter transfers created two of the present-day &#x27;exceptions&#x27; to the river boundary.

The modern administrative border between Devon and Cornwall more closely follows the Tamar and Hamoaze than the &#x27;historic&#x27; county border (of the 11th to 19th centuries). Only three &#x27;exceptions&#x27; to the rule that the border follows the river (from source to sea) currently exist, all of which are upstream of the confluence of the River Deer, in the upper course of the Tamar. Part of the Cornish civil parish of North Tamerton extends east across the river, whilst parts of the Devon civil parishes of Bridgerule and Pancrasweek extend west across the Tamar. Where the border does follow the Tamar, it is defined as being along a line running at the centre of the river — where the river is tidal, it is the centre of the low water channel. This &quot;centre of river&quot; arrangement ends just upstream of the Tamar Bridge at Saltash, downstream of which the counties officially extend only to their respective (tidal) bank&#x27;s low water mark. The river is dammed at two points of its upper course, forming two reservoirs in place of the natural river: at Upper Tamar Lake the border follows the line of the river as it was prior to the construction of the reservoir (therefore now within the lake), whilst at the older Lower Tamar Lake the border was re-aligned along a (now disused) re-routing of the river to the reservoir&#x27;s west side, placing the lake in Devon.

=== Crossings ===
List of crossings of the River Tamar
The river has 22 road crossings, including some medieval stone bridges. The oldest bridge still extant is at Horsebridge (1437), and the next oldest is Greystone Bridge near Lawhitton — this arched stone bridge was built in 1439. Gunnislake New Bridge was built in 1520 by Sir Piers Edgcumbe, the owner of Cotehele and Mount Edgcumbe. The Gunnislake bridge was a main route into south east Cornwall and the lowest bridge over the Tamar until the Tamar Bridge at Saltash was opened in 1962.

The lower Tamar is spanned also by the Royal Albert Bridge (built 1859), a rail bridge now adjacent to the newer Tamar Bridge. Both of these bridges are between Saltash (known as the &#x27;Gateway to Cornwall&#x27;) and Plymouth. Further downstream, crossing the Hamoaze, is the Torpoint Ferry — a chain ferry connecting Torpoint to Devonport — and at the most downstream part of the Hamoaze there is also the Cremyll Ferry.

The Calstock Viaduct is another notable structure on the Tamar, being 120 feet (37 m) high with twelve 60-foot (18 m) wide arches, of which three of the piers stand in the river, and was built between 1904 and 1907.

== Navigation ==
The total length of the tidal river (which, like other tidal waters in England, has public right of navigation) is . The normal tidal limit (noted on Ordnance Survey maps as &#x27;NTL&#x27;) is a weir just downstream of the village of Gunnislake. Waterborne traffic through the Hamoaze is controlled by the Queen&#x27;s Harbour Master for Plymouth, who is responsible for managing navigation along the entire tidal Tamar. The Royal Navy has one of its three main naval bases at Devonport, situated on the Hamoaze, upstream of which the river is now used largely by recreational craft. Excursions operate (April to October only) on the river between Plymouth and Calstock; excursions used to operate as far as Morwellham Quay, but were suspended indefinitely in 2016. A passenger ferry also operates April to October between Cotehele Quay and Calstock.

A typical Tamar vessel was a sailing barge, built on the open river bank, of up to 60 tons, with a peaked, gaff-rigged mainsail and a fore staysail. The Tamar was navigable by seagoing ships of up to 400 register tons as far inland as Weir Quay, near Bere Alston, where the estuary narrows into the tidal river, some upstream from Plymouth Sound. Vessels of 300 tons sailed as far inland as Morwellham, along the river from the sea. A further stretch of upstream to Weir Head, near Gunnislake, is accessible to smaller boats. Weir Head is just downstream of the weir at Gunnislake (the tidal limit) and is the final place to turn boats; it was from here that smaller craft could begin their journey on the Tamar Manure Canal.

=== Tamar Manure Navigation ===
In 1794 the Tamar Manure Navigation Company was formed to extend navigation inland for a further 30 miles, to Tamerton Bridge in North Tamerton. An Act of Parliament of 1796 authorised the works, with the company empowered to improve and manage navigation on the Tamar from Morwellham Quay upstream to Boat Pool, at Blanchdown (just upstream of Gunnislake), and to construct a canal from there. The project however advanced no further than Gunnislake, with work ceasing in 1808. Barges of up to 30 tons could then proceed as far as Gunnislake New Bridge, bypassing the weir (above Weir Head) via a 500-yard canal to the west of the river. As the only completed work of the original project, this short canal became known as the Tamar Manure (Navigation) Canal. It had one lock allowing vessels to rise from the tidal Tamar to the water level above the weir. A salmon ladder bypassed the lock.

The navigable route along the Tamar and the Manure Canal that was managed by the company (from Morwellham Quay upstream to Blanchdown) was known as the Tamar Manure Navigation and was in length. The import of fertilizer (at the time of the construction of the canal all types of which were typically referred to as &quot;manure&quot;) and coal and the export of bricks and granite along this short navigation proved profitable for many years. The navigation from Launceston to Tamerton was completed in 1826 as part of a separate project, the Bude Canal. The Tamar Manure Navigation ceased functioning in 1929 and the company was wound up in 1942.

== History ==
In 997 according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, raiding Vikings travelled up the Tamar and then the Tavy river as far as Lydford, and burned Ordwulf&#x27;s monastery at Tavistock.

During the English Civil War, Cornwall was entirely loyal to King Charles I and the Royalist cause. However, Devon was primarily Parliamentarian; thus the River Tamar became the site of many battles, such as the Battle of Gunnislake New Bridge on 20 July 1664. Each side of the Tamar understood that if they were either to invade or to defend themselves, they had to have control of the Tamar crossings.

In medieval times the transport of goods to supply the Benedictine abbey at Tavistock, four miles by track from the river port of Morwellham, was significant. Sea sand from the coast was imported to spread on farmland, until in the 18th century a dressing of lime was found to be more beneficial. Large quantities of limestone and coal were then imported to burn in the numerous limekilns on the river quays; the lime had to be made locally as it was not slaked before application, and was too chemically reactive for transport by water after burning. Later, street sweepings and other refuse from Plymouth and Devonport, together with bones for the newly discovered bone fertiliser, were carried inland to manure the fields. Other regular imports were timber from British Columbia and the Baltic, in large baulks for use as pit props in the mines, and coal from Wales to supply the mine pumping engines.

Tavistock was one of the three stannary towns of Devon, and large quantities of refined tin ore were exported through Morwellham from the 12th century until 1838, when the requirement to pay duty on the metal at one of the specified towns was relaxed. The opening in 1817 of the Tavistock Canal, between Tavistock and Morwellham, facilitated traffic. Later, the East Cornwall Mineral Railway provided an outlet through the quays of Calstock from the Cornish side of the valley. Other significant cargoes exported were quarried granite, and later, copper, lead and manganese ores, with their important by-product of arsenic. Arsenic was extracted from mispickel, once regarded as a waste product but later offering an important source of revenue as copper and tin extraction declined in profitability. The refined product was exported worldwide, in particular to the southern United States, where it was used as an insecticide in the cotton fields.

In the 13th century lead and silver output from the royal mines on the Bere peninsula (between the Tamar and the Tavy) was significant, and production continued intermittently until the 19th century. The Johnson Matthey smelting works at Weir Quay extracted silver and lead not only from local ore, but also from ore imported by sea from Europe and from as far away as Newfoundland. Fluorspar from the lead mine tailings was exported to France for use in the manufacture of glassware.
The old ferry crossings developed into the busy river quays of the 18th and 19th centuries.

The development of the &quot;Three Towns&quot; (Plymouth, Devonport and Stonehouse) at the mouth of the river offered an important market for the valley&#x27;s agricultural produce, needed in particular to serve the victualling requirements of the royal dockyard, and this was always carried by boat. In 1820 or 1821 the first paddle steamer on the Tamar inaugurated a service between Calstock and Devonport to deliver foodstuffs. In 1859 a rail connection from Plymouth to London was opened, and fresh produce could be landed at the Devonport steamer quays in the evening and be on sale in London by the next morning. The growing city population created a large demand for sightseeing cruises on the river; this was a significant source of traffic from 1823, with the launch of the Cornish steam packet &quot;Sir Francis Drake&quot;, until the outbreak of World War II.

Mineral traffic on the river diminished towards the end of the 19th century, after the Plymouth, Devonport and South Western Junction Railway reached Tavistock in 1859 (so making the Tavistock Canal to Morwellham redundant for transport, although it remains in use as a source of hydropower) and as the copper and tin mines became exhausted. The decline accelerated from 1894, when the East Cornwall Mineral Railway, until then linked to the outside world only through the port of Calstock, was extended to the Plymouth, Devonport and South Western Junction Railway at Bere Alston. Tourist and market traffic on the river, using purpose-built or converted steamers, remained substantial until the Devonport piers were closed and the ships requisitioned on the outbreak of war in 1939.

== Economy ==

Rocks around the edge of Dartmoor were mineralised by fluids driven by the heat of the Earth&#x27;s core, which gave rise to ores containing tin, copper, tungsten, lead and other minerals in the Valley. The medieval estate of Cotehele, owned by the Edgcumbe family, was a significant producer of silver for the Royal Mint. During the industrial revolution, there was significant mining activity near the river, between Gunnislake and Weir Quay. During this period, the Tamar was an important river for shipping copper from ports such as Morwellham Quay, Calstock and New Quay (Devon) to south Wales where it would be smelted. The valley forms district A10i of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape. The river has long been famous for the quality of its salmon whilst the valley was known nationally for the high quality, and early, soft fruit and market gardens sheltered by its steeply winding slopes.

== Folklore ==
The Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot; states that the mortal combat of King Arthur and Mordred took place close to the banks of the river.

A traditional Cornish tale claims that the devil would never dare to cross the River Tamar into Cornwall for fear of ending up as a pasty filling. Though unusual landscape features are often named after the devil (e.g. devil&#x27;s frying pan) it used to be said that the devil never came to Cornwall: he once reached Torpoint and immediately noticed that various kinds of pie were customary; he feared that devilly pie might be the next kind so returned to Devon. This legend is set to music in the traditional Cornish folk song Fish and Tin and Copper.

=== Legend of Tamara ===
The legend behind the name involves a nymph by the name of Tamara, who lived in the underworld. Tamara wanted to wander freely in the mortal world, against the advice of her parents. One day, wandering in Dartmoor, she happened to meet two giants called Tavy and Torridge (or Tawradge). Both giants became smitten with Tamara and vied for her affections. Tamara led the giants on a dance, but never let them touch her, instead darting out of reach whenever they came too close. Tamara&#x27;s father, who had been out looking for her, located her just as the giants finally caught up with her near Morwenstow. He flew into a rage and used a spell to put Tavy and Tawradge into a deep sleep. This infuriated Tamara, who subsequently refused to return to the underworld with her father. He became even more enraged and cast a spell on Tamara, turning her into a bubbling spring, which produced the Tamar river and flowed all the way to the sea. Tawradge awoke to find his beloved had become a river; in despair, he sought the advice of a magician, who turned him into a river (the River Torridge and the River Taw) so that he could hope to reunite with Tamara. Tawradge was never able to find and merge with his beloved Tamara, instead turning north toward Bideford and the Bristol Channel and is still said to mourn his love, the Tamar. This legend explains why the River Torridge, which rises only 500 metres from the Tamar, veers away from the Tamar and forms a huge arc, eventually flowing to the North Devon coast. The other giant, Tavy, also awoke in despair and sought the aid of his own father, also a powerful magician. His father turned Tavy into a river as well, and the Tavy set off in search of the Tamar, eventually finding her and merging with her into a wide and beautiful estuary.

<text>John Wilson Croker (20 December 178010 August 1857) was an Anglo-Irish and author.

==Life==
He was born in Galway, the only son of John Croker, the surveyor-general of customs and excise in Ireland. He was educated at Trinity College Dublin, where he graduated in 1800. Immediately afterwards he entered Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and in 1802 he was called to the Irish bar.

He married Rosamond Pennell, daughter of William Pennell and Elizabeth Pennell (née Carrington))on 22 May 1806, in Waterford, Ireland.

None of his children with Rosamond Pennell survived past 3 years old. He and Rosamond adopted Rosamond&#x27;s younger sister (who was the 18th child of Rosamond&#x27;s parents) and she was also (confusingly) named Rosamond Hester Elizabeth Pennell. The younger Rosamond was born in January 1810 in Waterford, Ireland (christened with the surname Pennell). Sometime between birth and 1814, she became part of the Croker family. The name she was better known by was the nickname &quot;Nony&quot; Croker. Nony&#x27;s portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence (commissioned by John Croker) is in the collection of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York.

His interest in the French Revolution led him to collect a large number of valuable documents on the subject, which are now in the British Museum. In 1804 he published anonymously &quot;Familiar Epistles to J. F. Jones, Esquire, on the State of the Irish Stage&quot;, a series of caustic criticisms in verse on the management of the Dublin theatres. The book ran through five editions in one year. Equally successful was the &quot;Intercepted Letter from Canton&quot; (1805), also anonymous, a satire on Dublin society in the guise of a report on the manners of the Chinese at Quang-tchen on the &quot;Li-fee&quot;. During this period a rather scathing poem attributed to Croker led to the suicide of actor John Edwin, husband of Elizabeth Rebecca Edwin. In 1807 he published a pamphlet on &quot;The State of Ireland, Past and Present&quot;, in which he advocated Catholic emancipation.

He was a distant relation of Thomas Crofton Croker, Irish writer and antiquarian, who served under him in the Admiralty.

==Parliamentary career==
The following year (1808) Croker entered parliament as member for Downpatrick, obtaining the seat on petition, though he had been unsuccessful at the poll. The acumen displayed in his Irish pamphlet led Spencer Perceval to recommend him to the Duke of Wellington, who had just been appointed to the command of British forces in the Iberian Peninsula, as his deputy in the office of chief secretary for Ireland. This connection led to a friendship which remained unbroken till Wellington&#x27;s death.

The notorious case of the Duke of York in connexion with his abuse of military patronage furnished Croker with an opportunity for distinguishing himself. The speech which he delivered on 14 March 1809, in answer to the charges of Colonel Wardle, was regarded as able; and Croker was appointed to the office of first secretary to the Admiralty, which he held without interruption under various administrations for more than twenty years. Among the first acts of his official career was the exposure of George Villiers, a fellow official who had misappropriated public funds to the extent of £280,000; Villiers was well regarded at court, and action was taken against him only after Croker threatened resignation. It was soon noted by a First Lord that although Croker described himself as the servant of the Board, in reality, the reverse was true. The second secretary to the Admiralty John Barrow became a close personal friend, and Barrow&#x27;s eldest son Sir George Barrow, 2nd Baronet married Croker&#x27;s adopted daughter Nony.

In 1816 he reduced the size of the Royal Navy, and over 1,000 ships were decommissioned and placed in the Reserve Fleet (United Kingdom) or &quot;laid up in ordinary&quot; at various British naval bases. In 1824 he helped found the Athenaeum Club, and when the members voted £2000 for an icehouse, instead he commissioned from sculptor John Henning a full-scale replica in Bath stone of sculptures from the Parthenon, occasioning the widely circulated squib &quot;I&#x27;m John Wilson Croker, I do as I please. They ask for an Ice House, I give them—a Frieze&quot;.

In 1827 he became the Member of Parliament for Dublin University, having previously sat successively for the boroughs of Athlone, Yarmouth, Bodmin and Aldeburgh. He was made a Privy Councillor in June 1828 and, having secured a pension of £1500 a year, retired from his post at the admiralty in 1830. He was a determined opponent of the Reform Bill, and vowed that he would never sit in a reformed parliament; he left parliament when the Act was passed in 1832. Many of his political speeches were published in pamphlet form, and they show him to have been a vigorous and effective, though somewhat unscrupulous and often virulently personal, party debater. Yet he could on occasion be magnanimous to his opponents: when Lord Althorp during a debate in the Commons, said that while he had figures which refuted Croker&#x27;s argument he had mislaid them, Croker replied that he would never doubt Althorp&#x27;s word. Croker had been an ardent supporter of Robert Peel, but finally broke with him when he began to advocate the repeal of the Corn Laws.

==Literary career==
Croker was for many years one of the leading contributors on literary and historical subjects to the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, with which he had been associated from its foundation. The rancorous spirit in which many of his articles were written did much to embitter party feeling. It also reacted unfavourably on Croker&#x27;s reputation as a worker in the department of pure literature by bringing political animosities into literary criticism.

He had no sympathy with the younger school of poets who were in revolt against the artificial methods of the 18th century. In April 1833 he savagely criticised &quot;Poems&quot;, published the previous December by Alfred Tennyson—an attack which, coupled with the death of his friend Arthur Hallam, discouraged the aspiring poet from seeking to publish anything more for nine years. He was also responsible for the famous &quot;Quarterly&quot; article on John Keats&#x27;s &quot;Endymion&quot;. Shelley and Byron blamed this article for bringing about the death of the poet, &#x27;snuffed out&#x27;, in Byron&#x27;s phrase, &#x27;by an article&#x27; (they, however, attributed the article to William Gifford).

His &quot;magnum opus&quot;, an edition of &quot;Boswell&#x27;s Life of Johnson&quot; (1831) was the subject of an unfavourable review by Macaulay in the Edinburgh Review (a Whig rival/opponent of the Quarterly Review) The main grounds of criticism were echoed by Thomas Carlyle in a less famous review in &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;
*that Croker had added extensive notes which were to little point, being superfluous or declaring Croker&#x27;s inability to grasp Johnson&#x27;s point on matters where the reviewers had no difficulty. Macaulay also complained (with numerous examples) of factual errors in the notes; Carlyle of their carping attitude to Johnson&#x27;s motives (Carlyle, whose father was a stonemason, and who (like Johnson) had scraped a living as a schoolmaster, before writing encyclopedia articles for bread-and-butter wages, also took great exception to one note which took for granted that when Johnson spoke of having lived on 4½ d a day he was disclosing something of which he should have been ashamed to speak)
*that Croker had not preserved the integrity of Boswell&#x27;s text, but had interpolated text from four other accounts of Johnson (Hawkins, Mrs Thrale etc.), distinguished only from genuine Boswell by being inside brackets, so that &quot;You begin a sentence under Boswell&#x27;s guidance, thinking to be carried happily through it by the same: but no; in the middle, perhaps after your semi-colon, and some consequent &#x27;for&#x27; – starts up one of these Bracket-ligatures, and stitches you in half a page to twenty or thirty pages of a Hawkins, Tyers, Murphy, Piozzi; so that often one must make the old sad reflection, Where we are, we know; whither we are going no man knoweth&quot;
Croker made no immediate reply to Macaulay&#x27;s attack, but when the first two volumes of Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; appeared he took the opportunity of pointing out the inaccuracies in the work.

George Birkbeck Hill in his preface to his 1887 edition of Boswell endorses much of Macaulay&#x27;s criticism of Croker, but adds, &quot;I should be wanting in justice were I not to acknowledge that I owe much to the labours of Mr Croker&quot;. Hill observed that Croker was &quot;not deeply versed in books&quot;, was &quot;shallow in himself&quot;, did not understand Johnson&#x27;s strong character, seemed inadequately acquainted with Johnson&#x27;s writings, failed to grasp Boswell&#x27;s flair as a biographer, and &quot;is careless in small matters, and his blunders are numerous&quot;:
:Yet he has added considerably to our knowledge of Johnson. He knew men who had intimately known both the hero and his biographer, and he gathered much that but for his care would have been lost for ever. He was diligent and successful in his search after Johnson&#x27;s letters, of so many of which Boswell with all his persevering and pushing diligence had not been able to get a sight.

Croker was occupied for several years on an annotated edition of Alexander Pope&#x27;s works. It was left unfinished at the time of his death, but it was afterwards completed by Whitwell Elwin and William John Courthope. He died at St Albans Bank, Hampton.

Croker was generally supposed to be the original from which Benjamin Disraeli drew the character of &quot;Rigby&quot; in &quot;Coningsby&quot;, because he had for many years had the sole management of the estates of the Marquess of Hertford, the &quot;Lord Monmouth&quot; of the story. Hostile portrayals of Croker can also be found in the novels &quot;Florence Macarthy&quot; by Lady Morgan (a political opponent whom Croker subjected to notoriously savage reviews in the &quot;Quarterly&quot;) and &quot;The Anglo-Irish of the Nineteenth Century&quot; (1828) by John Banim.

The chief works of Croker not already mentioned were:
*&quot;Stories for Children from the History of England&quot; (1817), which provided the model for Scott&#x27;s &quot;Tales of a Grandfather&quot;
*&quot;Letters on the Naval War with America&quot;

He also wrote several lyrical pieces of some merit, such as the &quot;Songs of Trafalgar&quot; (1806) and &quot;The Battles of Talavera&quot; (1809). He edited the &quot;Suffolk Papers&quot; (1823), Hervey&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs of the Court of George II&quot; (1817), the &quot;Letters of Mary Lepel, Lady Hervey&quot; (1821–1822), and Walpole&#x27;s &quot;Letters to Lord Hertford&quot; (1824). His memoirs, diaries and correspondence were edited by Louis J. Jennings in 1884 under the title of &quot;The Croker Papers&quot; (3 vols.).

<text>Pity Me is a suburban village of Durham, England, located north of Framwellgate Moor and west of Newton Hall.

==Etymology==
There are various theories on the origin of Pity Me&#x27;s unusual name. Most likely, as speculated in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of British Place Names&quot;, it is simply &quot;a whimsical name bestowed in the 19th century on a place considered desolate, exposed or difficult to cultivate&quot;. Alternatively it may be a shortened form of an earlier place name referring to a shallow lake or mere, such as &quot;Petit Mere&quot; (i.e. from Norman French), &quot;Petty Mere&quot; or &quot;Peaty Mere&quot;. Related theories suggest that it comes from &quot;Pithead Mere&quot;, referring to an extended area of boggy waste ground onto which the outwash from minehead pumping engines was discharged, or that &quot;petite mer&quot; () is an ironic name for the settlement given the arid nature of the land.

However, the existence of several examples of other, lesser settlements, that share this name in Northumberland - particularly one north of Barrasford, near Hexham, and another outside Hartburn, west of Morpeth - suggests that it may be derived from some actual feature of the landscape, or former land-use, that has since been forgotten (one exotic suggestion for the North Tynedale example being the Ancient British term &quot;Beddan Maes&quot;, meaning &quot;burial ground&quot; - although this suggestion has never been offered to explain the name of the Durham settlement. This form looks suspiciously like modern Welsh rather than any Brythonic name. As a Welsh name it makes no sense, although &#x27;bedd&#x27; is &#x27;grave&#x27;, and &#x27;maes&#x27; is &#x27;open field&#x27;).

More obvious folk etymologies include the story that the coffin of St Cuthbert was dropped near Pity Me on the way to Durham, at which point the saint implored the monks carrying him to take pity on him and be more careful; or that coming to the location during a flight from a Viking raid, a group of monks sang the 51st Psalm, the Latin version of which includes the words &quot;Miserere mei, Deus&quot;, which may be rendered in English as &quot;Pity me, O God&quot;.

==Transport==
Pity Me is bypassed by the A167 which connects to Darlington and Newcastle via Chester-le-Street along the former route of the A1 through the region.

The Arnison Centre, an out of town retail park, is located on the edge of the village. It is served by several frequent bus routes operated by Go North East; destinations include Newcastle, Sunderland, Durham and Sherburn Village.

There are various other instances of the place name &quot;Pity Me&quot; in the north of England: near Morpeth and Barrasford in Northumberland, near Bradbury in south County Durham and Pityme in Cornwall.

<text>Haxby Hall was an English house on York Road in Haxby, York. It was built in 1790 on 22 acres (89,000 m2) of land, and was grade II listed.

In 1923, Haxby Hall was the residence of William Abel Wood, JP During the Second World War, it was used to house evacuees from Hull.

In 1950, the then owner, Kenneth Ward, donated the house&#x27;s pleasure grounds to the village which now comprise the Ethel Ward Memorial Playing Field. As of 2021, this contains a playground, tennis courts and a scout hall. It hosts village events and local football teams.

The house, reduced to three acres (12,000 m2) of grounds, was demolished in 1960, and replaced in 1965 by the 52 bed Haxby Hall Residential Care Home, and an adjoining ambulance station.

<doc id="268385" wikidata="Q311913" url="?curid=268385" title="Orlando Gibbons">
<text>Orlando Gibbons (bapt. 25 December 1583 – 5 June 1625) was an English composer and keyboard player who was one of the last masters of the English Virginalist School and English Madrigal School. The best known member of a musical family dynasty, by the 1610s he was the leading composer and organist in England, with a career cut short by his sudden death in 1625. As a result, Gibbons&#x27;s &quot;oeuvre&quot; was not as large as that of his contemporaries, like the elder William Byrd, but he made considerable contributions to many genres of his time. He is often seen as a transitional figure from the Renaissance to the Baroque periods.

Gibbons was born into a musical family where his father was a wait, his brothers—Edward, Ellis and Ferdinand—were musicians and Orlando was expected to follow the tradition. It is not known under whom he studied, although it may have been with Edward or Byrd, but he almost certainly studied the keyboard in his youth. Irrespective of his education, he was musically proficient enough to be appointed an unsalaried member of the Chapel Royal in May 1603 and a full-fledged gentleman of the Chapel Royal as junior organist by 1605. By 1606 he had graduated from King&#x27;s College, Cambridge with a Bachelor of Music degree.

Throughout his professional career, Gibbons maintained good relations with many important people of the English court. King James I and Prince Charles were supportive patrons and others, such as Sir Christopher Hatton, even became close friends. Along with Byrd and John Bull, Gibbons was the youngest contributor to the first printed collection of English keyboard music, &quot;Parthenia&quot;, and published other compositions in his lifetime, notably, the &quot;First Set of Madrigals and Motets&quot; (1612) which includes the best known English madrigal: &quot;The Silver Swan&quot;. Other important compositions include &quot;This Is the Record of John&quot;, the 8-part full anthem &quot;O Clap Your Hands Together&quot; and 2 settings of Evensong. The most important position achieved by Gibbons was his appointment in 1623 as the organist at Westminster Abbey which he held for 2 years until his death.

Gibbons developed Byrd&#x27;s foundations of the English madrigal, full and verse anthems, and by doing so he exerted significant influence on subsequent English composers. This generation included his oldest son Christopher, who would teach John Blow, Pelham Humfrey and Henry Purcell, the English pioneer of the Baroque era. After his death he was primarily remembered a composer of sacred music. Since the early music revival however, increased attention has come to his other compositions, with his keyboard works championed by Glenn Gould, while his madrigals and viol fantasies are popular among early music ensembles. By the 21st-century almost all of his music has been published and recorded.
==Life and career==
===Birthplace and background===

Orlando Gibbons was born in Oxford. Until the early 20th-century he was believed to have been born in Cambridge. This was accepted as fact by his contemporaries, stated in multiple early biographies and even recorded on his memorial monument in Canterbury Cathedral, erected soon after his death. It is even possible that Gibbons himself thought that he was born in Cambridge, since he spent most of his life there and only the first four to five years of his life in Oxford. Matters are made more confusing as his father had lived in Cambridge for at least ten years before the birth of Gibbons. Therefore, even though 17th-century biographer Anthony Wood discovered a record of an &quot;Orlando Gibbons&quot; being baptised in St Martin&#x27;s Church, Oxford, it was assumed that Gibbons was born in Cambridge but baptized in Oxford. Modern historians have proved the claim that he was born in Cambridge to be incorrect. Not only was the baptismal record shown to be authentic, but it was discovered that Orlando&#x27;s parents both resided in Oxford at the time of his birth, confirming that Orlando was born in Oxford and baptized at St. Martin&#x27;s, Oxford.

The Gibbons family can be traced back to Richard Gibbons ( 1577), who was a glover active in Oxford; by 1549/50 he became a hanaster. Richard&#x27;s son William was probably born in 1540 and at some point married Mary, whose maiden name is unknown. By 1567, William became wait at Cambridge by 1567. From 1580 to 1588 he lived in Oxford, where he was a city councillor and head of the town waits there.

===Early life===
While in Oxford, William and Mary had Orlando as probably the seventh of nine surviving children. There is no surviving record of the date of his birth, but he is recorded as being baptised at St. Martin&#x27;s on Christmas Day 1583. It would be consistent with the normal practice of the time that Gibbons was born no more than a week before his baptism. Gibbons&#x27;s father had previously lived in Cambridge where he was also the head of the town waits and around 1588, when Orlando was 4–5 years old, the Gibbons family moved back to Cambridge and William resumed his previous post there.
Orlando was born into a musical family: not only was his father a musician, but his oldest brother, Edward, was a composer and master of the Choir of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. His second brother, Ellis, was a promising composer but died prematurely, and his third brother, Ferdinando, eventually took their father&#x27;s place as a wait. Not much else is known about Orlando Gibbons&#x27;s youth, but being born into a musical family he was almost certainly instructed on a keyboard instrument and perhaps the viol. At the age of 12, he became a member of Edward&#x27;s Choir of King&#x27;s on 14 February 1596. He was a regular member of the choir until some time in the Michaelmas term of 1598. In the Easter term (summer term) of the same year he enrolled at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge as a sizar, meaning he paid reduced fees but had to do various menial tasks. From 1598–99 Gibbons&#x27;s name appeared sporadically in the chorus member logs, suggesting that, if not a clerical error, he continued to sing from time to time, perhaps for special occasions.

Gibbons&#x27;s composition teacher is also unknown. It is possible he continued study with Edward, though there is no record of this. Another possible composition teacher is William Byrd, who was at least 40 years his senior and the most respected English composer at the time. Gibbons and Byrd along with the composer John Bull later collectively published music and since Bull was a student of Byrd&#x27;s, Gibbons may very well also have been. Regardless of how his musical education came about, Gibbons was known to be composing music by the end of his time at the choir in 1599, at age 15–16. There is nothing known of Gibbons from then until 1603.

===Early career and marriage===

Gibbons&#x27;s abilities had reached the point to allow him become a musician of the Chapel Royal by at least 19 May 1603. The Chapel Royal was a sizable group of priests and musicians who attended to the Monarch and royal household and Gibbons name appears at this time in a cheque book of the Chapel. Gibbons was a Gentleman Extraordinary (unpaid substitute) awaiting the vacancy of a paid position. Earlier that year King James I had ascended to the throne; in all likelihood Gibbons took part in the hymns and anthems of the 25 July coronation. 1603 was a year of mixed fortunes: he received his first position as a professional musician, but in the same year both his mother and his brother Ellis died. The plague may have been what his brother Ellis succumbed to. Eventually Gibbons&#x27;s awaited vacancy occurred with the death of Arthur Cook in January 1605, and on 21 March 1605 he secured the prestigious position of Gentleman of the Chapel Royal, as the junior chapel organist. Edward Gibbons&#x27;s friendship with the former organist, Arthur Cook, and the senior chapel organist, John Bull, may have helped his younger brother secure this position. Gibbons kept the position until the end of his life.

In 1606 Gibbons married Elizabeth Patten on 17 February. Her father, John Patten, was a yeoman of the vestry in the Chapel Royal, and probably well acquainted with Gibbons, which would have helped to bring about the marriage. When John Patten died in 1623, he made Gibbons his sole heir, residuary legatee and left 200 pounds for his children. Later in 1606, Orlando graduated from Cambridge with the degree of Bachelor in Music. Gibbons and his wife lived in Woolstaple (now Bridge Street) which was in the parish of St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, the church where Gibbons&#x27;s seven children—James, Alice, Christopher, Ann, Mary, Elizabeth and Orlando—would be baptised.

===Publishing and patronage===
By the 1610s Gibbons had become a composer of high repute and the most outstanding organist in England. He became a close friend of Sir Christopher Hatton, the second cousin and heir of the more famous Christopher Hatton, favourite of Queen Elizabeth I. Though Hatton was a minor figure in court, he became an important patron to Gibbons. The next few years saw the publishing of various works by Gibbons, firstly his 1612 &quot;First Set of Madrigals and Motets&quot; from the patronage of Hatton. One of the Madrigals in the set was &quot;The Silver Swan&quot;, often considered the most famous English madrigal. Gibbons dedicated the entire set of works to Hatton: &quot;[The songs] were most of them composed in your owne [&quot;sic&quot;] house, and doe therefore properly belong unto you, as Lord of the Soile; the language they speake you provided them, I onely furnished them with Tongues to utter the same name&quot;. The English musician Frederick Bridge interpreted this as implying that Hatton wrote some or all of the poems that Gibbons set to music in his &quot;Madrigals and Motets&quot;. However, the musicologist Edmund Fellowes noted that it is unlikely Gibbons was an actual resident of Hatton&#x27;s household, although their friendship suggests that Hatton may have set a room aside for him to compose. The death of King James&#x27;s son, Prince Henry Frederick, was a considerable shock to the English, as many considered him a promising heir to the Kingdom. James in particular went into a deep depression; many wrote works to mourn Henry&#x27;s death, including writers Ben Jonson and George Chapman as well as composers John Coperario and the retired Byrd. Among these was probably Gibbons&#x27;s &quot;Nay let me weep&quot; from the recently published &quot;First Set of Madrigals and Motets&quot;. It is also possible that the full anthem &quot;I am the resurrection&quot; was for Prince Henry&#x27;s burial, though there is no firm evidence for this.
In 1613 Gibbons had six works published in the first printed collection of English keyboard music, &quot;Parthenia&quot;, which included works by the older composers, Byrd and Bull. This publication was to celebrate the marriage of the Princess Elizabeth Stuart to Frederick V of the Palatinate. Gibbons&#x27;s compositions written around the time of &quot;Parthenia&quot; include various anthems dedicated to senior nobles and clergy: the pavane &quot;Lord Salisbury&quot; for Lord Salisbury, the wedding anthem &quot;Blessed are all they&quot; for the Earl of Somerset, as well as anthems for Godfrey Goodman, William Laud and Anthony Maxey. Such works suggest that he was well associated throughout the court and that he was aiming for a permanent post. Frederick returned to Heidelberg with Elizabeth in 1613 and the couple was accompanied by a vast entourage, including Coperario and the harpist Daniel Callinder. A list of attendants includes &quot;Gibbons&quot;, which presumably refers to Orlando Gibbons, meaning that the composer spent some time in the capital of the Electoral Palatinate. Gibbons seems to have taken Bull&#x27;s place, who was in financial jeopardy.

In 1614 William Leighton published &quot;The Teares and Lamentatacions of a Sorrowfull Soule&quot; with 2 contributions by Gibbons, &quot;O Lord how do my woes increase&quot; and &quot;O Lord, I lift my heart to Thee&quot;. Although he possibly started as early as 1605, Gibbons was the joint organist of the Royal Chapel with Edmund Hooper by at least 1615. The same year he received two grants from King James I, worth 150 pounds total. These grants were: &quot;For and in consideration of the good and faithful service heretofore done unto ourself by Orlando Gibbons our organist, and divers other good causes and considerations us thereunto moving&quot;. Gibbons continued writing for James I, composing the anthem &quot;Great King of Gods&quot; and the court song &quot;Do not repine, fair sun&quot; in celebration of the King&#x27;s 1617 visit to Scotland.

===Late career===

By the late 1610s Gibbons was undoubtedly the most important musician and composer at court as Byrd had been long-retired in Essex and Bull had left for the Low Countries in late 1614. In 1617 Gibbons gained the position as keyboard player in an ensemble, organised by John Cooper, for the privy chamber of Prince Charles (later King Charles I). Gibbons was the only keyboardist in a group of 17 musicians which included Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger, Thomas Ford, Robert Johnson and Thomas Lupo. The Prince himself was thought to have occasionally joined on either the Bass-Viol or Viol da Gamba. It is likely that Gibbons, along with Coperario, was able to write for this ensemble and had pieces premiered by it. In addition to this, Gibbons probably gained a 3rd position in September 1619, attending the royal privy chamber of James I. His next major work, &quot;Fantasies of Three Parts&quot; was published around 1620 and dedicated it to Edmund Wray. This seemingly random dedication has provoked much speculation. It may be because Wray could secure Gibbons a better post, or it may be an action of gratitude for having already secured him the post for the royal privy chamber of the King.

While once assumed to be fact, there is now much doubt whether Gibbons received a Doctorate of Music in May 1622. In 1692, Wood stated:

This uncertainty has continued until the present day. Gibbons’s 8-part full anthem, &quot;O clap your hands&quot; was sung on 17 May 1622 at the degree ceremony for William Heather. Heather had financially supported William Camden&#x27;s creation and maintenance of the Camden Professor of Ancient History chair, and in return the university awarded him the honorary degrees of bachelor in music and doctor of music, even though he was not known to be a musician. The author Sir John Hawkins and musicologists Fellowes and David Mateer state unequivocally that Gibbons was awarded a doctorate along with Heather, and cite &quot;O clap your hands&quot; as the composer’s qualifying exercise for the degree. Other musicologists—Peter Le Huray, John Harper and John Harley—express some doubt whether Gibbons received a doctorate. Specifically, Harley cites a record in the Cheque book of the Chapel Royal that refers to William Heather as &quot;doctor&quot; but Gibbons as &quot;senior organist.&quot; The same writer refers to a letter from Camden to William Piers from 18 May 1622 that says Gibbons is a Doctor of Music. Harley suggests that the authenticity of the letter is uncertain, since the original does not survive; he suggests that Camden could have written something such as &quot;G––––s,&quot; which an editor assumed to mean Gibbons. The most convincing piece of evidence is thought to be the absence of mention of the supposed doctorate of music on Gibbons&#x27;s Cambridge monument, erected in his memory when he died. Although the existing evidence seems to support the conclusion that he never achieved a doctorate in music, there is no indisputable evidence to confirm it.

===Final years and death===

Some time in 1623, George Wither published &quot;Hymnes and Songs of the Church&quot; in which Gibbons provided the tunes for most of the songs. The same year he succeeded John Parsons as the organist at Westminster Abbey, with Thomas Day as junior organist. This was probably the most important position Gibbons had taken in his career thus far and on 7 May 1625 he officiated at the funeral of King James I.

During late May 1625, the English court was preparing to receive Queen Henrietta Maria, whom the now King Charles I of England had married through proxy in France on 1 May. Gibbons and other Chapel Royal members had begun travelling to Canterbury on 31 May when Gibbons suddenly succumbed to an illness, probably a brain haemorrhage. He died at age 41 in Canterbury and was buried in Canterbury Cathedral. His death was a shock to his peers and brought about a post-mortem, although the cause of death aroused less comment than the haste of his burial and his body&#x27;s not being returned to London. His wife Elizabeth died a little over a year later, in her mid-30s, leaving Orlando&#x27;s eldest brother, Edward to care for the orphaned children.

==Character==

There is little known about Gibbons&#x27;s personality or character. Harley names this, along with the period between his time in the Choir of King&#x27;s and his appointment at the Chapel Royal (1599–1603), as the largest gaps in the modern understanding of Gibbons. The lives of his contemporaries Byrd and Bull make Gibbons&#x27;s life seem comparably dull. Byrd frequently found himself in court—once even against Gibbons&#x27;s father William—in disputes over property or accusations that he was Catholic in post-Reformation England. Bull on the other hand had to flee the country while chief organist of the Chapel Royal on charges of adultery. One incident in Gibbons&#x27;s life, however, is described by Harley as &quot;the most bizarre event of Gibbons&#x27;s career&quot;. A complaint in 1620 reported that Henry Eveseed, a yeoman of the vestry, assaulted Gibbons, the report saying: he &quot;did violently and sodenly without cause runne uppon Mr Gibbons took up and threw him doune uppon a standard... and withall he tare his band from his neck&quot;. Other than this, the relative normality of Gibbons&#x27;s life suggests he maintained good relations with his employers and fellow musicians. His patron Hatton seems to have become a close friend. In fact, Hatton and his wife, Alice Fanshawe, were probably the namesakes of two of Gibbons&#x27;s two eponymous children. Other close acquaintances throughout his life included Wray, his father-in-law John Patten and his older brother Edward. It is also possible Gibbons had a particularly close relationship with Prince Charles; Gibbons&#x27;s death&#x27;s &quot;formal observation, investigation, and reporting, perhaps suggests how close he may have been to the new king.&quot;

Gibbons&#x27;s music may give some insight into his character. His career was primarily centered around court, where he seems to have been increasingly successful. Indeed Gibbons&#x27;s Chapel Royal posts at age 19, and then 21, would have been an impressive feat, comparable to Byrd becoming the organist and choirmaster of the Lincoln Cathedral in his early twenties. Each of the four positions he held centered around his ability as a keyboardist. Contemporary accounts hold him in high regard in this respect; during a 1624 visit from the French ambassador, John Hacket said upon entering Westminster Abbey that &quot;At the entrance, the organ was touched by the best finger of that age, Mr. Orlando Gibbons.&quot; John Chamberlain stated in a letter to Sir Dudley Carleton on Gibbons&#x27;s death that he had &quot;the best hand in England&quot;.

==Music==
His &quot;oeuvre&quot; as a whole suggests he was comfortable composing in the genres he had established himself in, rarely adventuring to unexplored genres.

Gibbons wrote a large number of keyboard works, around thirty fantasias for viols, a number of madrigals (the best-known being &quot;The Silver Swan&quot;), and many popular verse anthems, all to English texts (the best known being &quot;Great Lord of Lords&quot;). Perhaps his best-known verse anthem is &quot;This Is the Record of John&quot;, which sets an Advent text for solo countertenor or tenor, alternating with full chorus. The soloist is required to demonstrate considerable technical facility, and the work expresses the text&#x27;s rhetorical force without being demonstrative or bombastic. He also produced two major settings of Evensong, the Short Service and the Second Service, an extended composition combining verse and full sections. Gibbons&#x27;s full anthems include the expressive &quot;O Lord, in thy wrath&quot;, and the Ascension Day anthem &quot;O clap your hands together&quot; (after Psalm 47) for eight voices.

Gibbons&#x27;s surviving keyboard output comprises some 45 pieces. The polyphonic fantasia and dance forms are the best represented genres. Gibbons&#x27;s writing exhibits a command of three- and four-part counterpoint. Most of the fantasias are complex, multi-sectional pieces, treating multiple subjects imitatively. Gibbons&#x27;s approach to melody, in both his fantasias and his dances, features extensive development of simple musical ideas, as for example in &quot;Pavane in D minor&quot; and &quot;Lord Salisbury&#x27;s Pavan and Galliard&quot;.

==Legacy==
In the 20th century, the Canadian pianist Glenn Gould championed Gibbons&#x27;s music, and named him as his favourite composer. Gould wrote of Gibbons&#x27;s hymns and anthems: &quot;ever since my teen-age years this music ... has moved me more deeply than any other sound experience I can think of.&quot;

In one interview, Gould compared Gibbons to Beethoven and Webern:
Gibbons&#x27;s death, on 5 June 1625, is regularly marked in King&#x27;s College Chapel, Cambridge, by the singing of his music at Evensong. A number of Gibbons&#x27;s church anthems were included in the &quot;Oxford Book of Tudor Anthems&quot;.

Musicologist and composer, Frederick Ouseley, dubbed him to be the &quot;English Palestrina.&quot; Gibbons paved the way for a future generation of English composers by perfecting Byrd&#x27;s foundations of the English madrigal as well as both full and verse anthems, and especially by teaching music to his oldest son, Christopher, who in turn taught John Blow, Pelham Humfrey and most notably Henry Purcell, the English pioneer of the Baroque era. The modern music critic John Rockwell claimed that the oeuvre of Gibbons: &quot;all attested not merely to a significant figure in music&#x27;s past but to a composer who can still speak directly to the present.&quot;

<text>A substance is anhydrous if it contains no water. Many processes in chemistry can be impeded by the presence of water; therefore, it is important that water-free reagents and techniques are used. In practice, however, it is very difficult to achieve perfect dryness; anhydrous compounds gradually absorb water from the atmosphere so they must be stored carefully.

==Solids==
Many salts and solids can be dried using heat, or under vacuum. Desiccators can also be used to store reagents in dry conditions.

Common desiccants include phosphorus pentoxide and silica gel. Chemists may also require dry glassware for sensitive reactions. This can be achieved by drying glassware in an oven, by flame, or under vacuum.

Dry solids can be produced by freeze-drying, which is also known as lyophilization.

==Liquids or solvents==
In many cases, the presence of water can prevent a reaction from happening, or cause undesirable products to form. To prevent this, anhydrous solvents must be used when performing certain reactions. Examples of reactions requiring the use of anhydrous solvents are the Grignard reaction and the Wurtz reaction.

Solvents have typically been dried using distillation or by reaction with reactive metals or metal hydrides. These methods can be dangerous and are a common cause of lab fires. More modern techniques include the use of molecular sieves or a column purification system. Molecular sieves are far more effective than most common methods for drying solvents and are safer and require no special equipment for handling. Column solvent purification devices (generally referred to as Grubb&#x27;s columns) recently became available, reducing the hazards (water reactive substances, heat) from the classical dehydrating methods.

Anhydrous solvents are commercially available from chemical suppliers, and are packaged in sealed containers to maintain dryness. Typically anhydrous solvents will contain approximately 10 ppm of water and will increase in wetness if they are not properly stored.

Organic solutions can be dried using a range of drying agents. Typically following a workup the organic extract is dried using magnesium sulfate or a similar drying agent to remove most remaining water.

Anhydrous acetic acid is known as glacial acetic acid.

==Gases==
Several substances that exist as gases at standard conditions of temperature and pressure are commonly used as concentrated aqueous solutions. To clarify that it is the gaseous form that is being referred to, the term &quot;anhydrous&quot; is prefixed to the name of the substance:
*Gaseous ammonia is generally referred to as &quot;anhydrous&quot; ammonia, to distinguish it from its solution in water, household ammonia solution, also known as ammonium hydroxide.
*Gaseous hydrogen chloride is generally referred to as &quot;anhydrous&quot;, to distinguish it from its solution in water, hydrochloric acid.

Reactions which produce water can be kept dry using a Dean–Stark apparatus.

<doc id="268401" wikidata="Q468293" url="?curid=268401" title="First Barbary War">
<text>The First Barbary War (1801–1805), also known as the Tripolitan War and the Barbary Coast War, was a conflict during the 1801–1815 Barbary Wars, in which the United States fought against Ottoman Tripolitania. Tripolitania had declared war against the United States over disputes regarding tributary payments in exchange for a cessation of Tripolitanian commerce raiding at sea. United States President Thomas Jefferson refused to pay this tribute. The First Barbary War was the first major American war fought outside the New World, and in the Arab world, besides the smaller American–Algerian War (1785–1795).

==Background and overview==

Barbary corsairs and crews from the quasi-independent North African Ottoman provinces of Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli, and the independent Sultanate of Morocco under the Alaouite dynasty (the Barbary Coast) were the scourge of the Mediterranean. Capturing merchant ships and enslaving or ransoming their crews provided the rulers of these nations with wealth and naval power. The Trinitarian Order, or order of &quot;Mathurins&quot;, had operated from France for centuries with the special mission of collecting and disbursing funds for the relief and ransom of prisoners of Mediterranean pirates. According to Robert Davis, between 1 and 1.25 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves between the 16th and 19th centuries.

Barbary corsairs led attacks upon American merchant shipping in an attempt to extort ransom for the lives of captured sailors, and ultimately tribute from the United States to avoid further attacks, as they had with the various European states. Before the Treaty of Paris, which formalized the United States&#x27; independence from Great Britain, United States shipping was protected by France during the revolutionary years under the Treaty of Alliance (1778–83). Although the treaty does not mention the Barbary States in name, it refers to common enemies between both the United States and France. As such, piracy against United States shipping only began to occur after the end of the American Revolution, when the United States government lost its protection under the Treaty of Alliance.
This lapse of protection by a European power led to the first American merchant ship being seized after the Treaty of Paris. On 11 October 1784, Moroccan pirates seized the brigantine &quot;Betsey&quot;. The Spanish government negotiated the freedom of the captured ship and crew; however, Spain advised the United States to offer tribute to prevent further attacks against merchant ships. The United States Minister to France, Thomas Jefferson, decided to send envoys to Morocco and Algeria to try to purchase treaties and the freedom of the captured sailors held by Algeria. Morocco was the first Barbary Coast State to sign a treaty with the United States, on 23 June 1786. This treaty formally ended all Moroccan piracy against American shipping interests. Specifically, article six of the treaty states that if any Americans captured by Moroccans or other Barbary Coast States docked at a Moroccan city, they would be set free and come under the protection of the Moroccan State.

American diplomatic action with Algeria, the other major Barbary Coast State, was much less productive than with Morocco. Algeria began piracy against the United States on 25 July 1785 with the capture of the schooner &quot;Maria&quot;, and &quot;Dauphin&quot; a week later. All four Barbary Coast states demanded $660,000 each (equivalent to $ million in ). However, the envoys were given only an allocated budget of $40,000 () to achieve peace. Diplomatic talks to reach a reasonable sum for tribute or for the ransom of the captured sailors struggled to make any headway. The crews of &quot;Maria&quot; and &quot;Dauphin&quot; remained enslaved for over a decade, and soon were joined by crews of other ships captured by the Barbary States.

In March 1786, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams went to London to negotiate with Tripoli&#x27;s envoy, ambassador Sidi Haji Abdrahaman (or Sidi Haji Abdul Rahman Adja). When they enquired &quot;concerning the ground of the pretensions to make war upon nations who had done them no injury&quot;, the ambassador replied:

It was written in their Koran, that all nations which had not acknowledged the Prophet were sinners, whom it was the right and duty of the faithful to plunder and enslave; and that every mussulman who was slain in this warfare was sure to go to paradise. He said, also, that the man who was the first to board a vessel had one slave over and above his share, and that when they sprang to the deck of an enemy&#x27;s ship, every sailor held a dagger in each hand and a third in his mouth; which usually struck such terror into the foe that they cried out for quarter at once. 

Jefferson reported the conversation to Secretary of Foreign Affairs John Jay, who submitted the ambassador&#x27;s comments and offer to Congress. The incident convinced Jefferson that paying further tribute would do nothing to prevent more attacks. Although John Adams agreed with Jefferson, he believed that circumstances forced the United States to pay tribute; the United States had just fought an exhausting war, which put the nation deep into debt and unable to finance the establishment of a navy.

Various letters and testimonies by captured sailors described their time in captivity. Barbary Coast imprisonment was different from that practiced by the United States and the European powers of the time. Prisoners were able to obtain wealth and property, along with achieving status beyond that of a slave. One such example was James Leander Cathcart, who rose to the highest position a Christian slave could achieve in Algeria, becoming an adviser to the &quot;dey&quot; (governor). Even so, most captives could expect little more than lives of hard labor and abuse, and struggled under extremely poor conditions that exposed them to vermin and disease. As word of their treatment reached the United States, through freed captives&#x27; narratives and letters, Americans pushed for Congress to take military action against the Barbary states.

On July 19, 1794, Congress appropriated $800,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) for the release of American prisoners and for a peace treaty with Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli. On September 5, 1795, American negotiator Joseph Donaldson signed a peace treaty with the Dey of Algiers, that included an upfront payment of $642,500 in specie (&quot;silver coinage&quot;, equivalent to $ million in ) for peace, the release of American captives, various expenses for their care, and various gifts for the Dey&#x27;s royal court and family. An additional indefinite yearly tribute of $21,600 () in shipbuilding supplies and ammunition would be given to the Dey. The treaty, designed to prevent further piracy, resulted in the release of 115 American sailors held captive by the Dey.

Jefferson continued to argue for cessation of the tribute, with rising support from George Washington and others. With the recommissioning of the American Navy in 1794 and a rush of new ships and weapons, it became increasingly possible for America to cease payments, although by now the long-standing habit was difficult to change. The continuing demand for tribute ultimately led to the formation of the United States Department of the Navy, founded in 1798 to prevent further attacks upon American shipping while resolving the issue of Barbary piracy. Federalist and Anti-Federalist forces argued over the needs of the country and the burden of taxation. Jefferson&#x27;s own Democratic-Republicans and anti-navalists believed that the future of the country lay in westward expansion, arguing that the Atlantic trade threatened to siphon money and energy away from the new nation while entangling it in the wars and intrigue of the Old World. During the divisive 1800 presidential election, Thomas Jefferson defeated incumbent President John Adams. Jefferson was sworn into office on March 4, 1801. The new President was now poised to order naval actions against the Barbary states.

==Declaration of war and naval blockade==
Just before Jefferson&#x27;s inauguration in 1801, Congress passed naval legislation that, among other things, provided for six frigates that &quot;shall be officered and manned as the President of the United States may direct.&quot; In the event of a declaration of war on the United States by the Barbary powers, these ships were to &quot;protect our commerce and chastise their insolence—by sinking, burning or destroying their ships and vessels wherever you shall find them.&quot; On Jefferson&#x27;s inauguration as president in 1801, Yusuf Karamanli, the &quot;Pasha&quot; (or &quot;Bashaw&quot;) of Tripoli, demanded $225,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) from the new administration. It was a long-standing tradition that, if a government was changed or the consular was changed, said government would have to pay &#x27;consular&#x27; gifts, in either gold or in goods, usually military and naval stores. (In 1800, federal revenues totaled a little over $10 million, equivalent to $ million in .) Putting his long-held beliefs into practice, Jefferson refused the demand. Consequently, because of this, along with the Americans not paying the money nor the gifts as stated in the Treaty of Tripoli signed in 1796 between Tripoli and America, on 10 May 1801, the Pasha declared war on the United States, not through any formal written documents but in the customary Barbary manner of cutting down the flagstaff in front of the United States Consulate. Algiers and Tunis did not follow their ally in Tripoli.

Before learning that Tripoli had declared war on the United States, Jefferson sent a small squadron, consisting of three frigates and one schooner, under the command of Commodore Richard Dale, with gifts and letters to attempt to maintain peace with the Barbary powers. However, if war had been declared, then Dale was instructed to &quot;protect American ships and citizens against potential aggression&quot;; however, Jefferson made it clear that he was &quot;unauthorized by the constitution, without the sanction of Congress, to go beyond the line of defense.&quot; He told Congress: &quot;I communicate [to you] all material information on this subject, that in the exercise of this important function confided by the constitution to the legislature exclusively their judgment may form itself on a knowledge and consideration of every circumstance of weight.&quot; Although Congress never voted on a formal declaration of war, it authorized the President to instruct the commanders of armed American vessels to seize all vessels and goods of the Pasha of Tripoli &quot;and also to cause to be done all such other acts of precaution or hostility as the state of war will justify.&quot; The American squadron joined a Swedish flotilla under Rudolf Cederström in blockading Tripoli, the Swedes having been at war with the Tripolitans since 1800.

On 31 May 1801, Dale&#x27;s successor, Commodore Edward Preble, traveled to Messina, Sicily, to the court of King Ferdinand IV of the Kingdom of Naples. The kingdom was at war with Napoleon, but Ferdinand saw an opportunity and supplied the Americans with manpower, craftsmen, supplies, gunboats, mortar boats, and the ports of Messina, Syracuse, and Palermo to be used as naval bases for launching operations against Tripoli, a port walled fortress city protected by 150 pieces of heavy artillery and manned by 25,000 soldiers, assisted by a fleet of 10 ten-gunned brigs, 2 eight-gun schooners, two large galleys, and 19 gunboats. 

The first action of the campaign took place on 1 August 1801, when the armed schooner (commanded by Lieutenant Andrew Sterret) defeated the 14-gun Tripolitan corsair &quot;Tripoli&quot; in battle.

In 1802, in response to Jefferson&#x27;s request for a formal authorization of anti-piracy efforts, Congress passed &quot;An act for the protection of commerce and seamen of the United States against the Tripolitan cruisers&quot;, authorizing the President to &quot;employ such of the armed vessels of the United States as may be judged requisite... for protecting effectually the commerce and seamen thereof on the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean and adjoining seas.&quot; The statute authorized American ships to seize vessels belonging to the Bey of Tripoli, with the captured property distributed to those who brought the vessels into port.

The United States Navy went unchallenged on the sea, but the question of how far to push the conflict remained. Jefferson pressed the issue the following year, with an increase in military force and deployment of many of the navy&#x27;s best ships to the region throughout 1802. , , , , &quot;Enterprise&quot;, , , , , , , , , &quot;Scourge&quot;, , and (joined in 1805) all saw service during the war, under the overall command of Preble. Throughout 1803, Preble set up and maintained a blockade of the Barbary ports while taking action to seize and harass their fleets.

==Battles==

In October 1803, Tripoli&#x27;s fleet captured the USS &quot;Philadelphia&quot; intact after the frigate ran aground on a reef while patrolling Tripoli harbor. Efforts by the Americans to refloat the ship while under fire from shore batteries and Tripolitan Naval units failed. The ship, her captain William Bainbridge, and all officers and crew were taken ashore and held as hostages. &quot;Philadelphia&quot; was subsequently converted into a floating battery for harbor defense.

On the night of 16 February 1804, Captain Stephen Decatur led a small detachment of United States Marines aboard the captured Tripolitan ketch rechristened &quot;Intrepid&quot;, thus deceiving the guards on &quot;Philadelphia&quot; to float close enough to board her. Decatur&#x27;s men stormed the ship and overpowered the Tripolitan sailors. With fire support from American warships, the Marines set fire to &quot;Philadelphia&quot; and destroyed her.

Preble attacked Tripoli on 14 July 1804, kicking off a series of inconclusive battles, including an unsuccessful attempt to use &quot;Intrepid&quot; under Captain Richard Somers as a fire ship, packed with explosives and sent to enter Tripoli harbor. However, &quot;Intrepid&quot; was destroyed, possibly by enemy gunfire, before she achieved her goal, killing Somers and his entire crew.
The turning point in the war was the Battle of Derna (April–May 1805). Ex-consul William Eaton, a former Army captain who used the title of &quot;general&quot;, and United States Marine Corps 1st Lieutenant Presley O&#x27;Bannon led a force of eight U.S. Marines and five hundred mercenaries—Greeks from Crete, Arabs, and Berbers—on a march across the desert from Alexandria, Egypt, to capture the Tripolitan city of Derna. This was the first time the United States flag was raised in victory on foreign soil. The action is memorialized in a line of the Marines&#x27; Hymn—&quot;the shores of Tripoli&quot;. The capturing of the city gave American negotiators leverage in securing the return of hostages and the end of the war.
==Peace treaty and legacy==
Wearied of the blockade and raids, and now under threat of a continued advance on Tripoli proper and a scheme to restore his deposed older brother Hamet Karamanli as ruler, Yusuf Karamanli signed a treaty ending hostilities on 10 June 1805. Article 2 of the treaty reads:
The Bashaw of Tripoli shall deliver up to the American squadron now off Tripoli, all the Americans in his possession; and all the subjects of the Bashaw of Tripoli now in the power of the United States of America shall be delivered up to him; and as the number of Americans in possession of the Bashaw of Tripoli amounts to three hundred persons, more or less; and the number of Tripolino subjects in the power of the Americans to about, one hundred more or less; The Bashaw of Tripoli shall receive from the United States of America, the sum of sixty thousand dollars, as a payment for the difference between the prisoners herein mentioned.

In agreeing to pay a ransom of $60,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) for the American prisoners, the Jefferson administration drew a distinction between paying &quot;tribute&quot; and paying &quot;ransom&quot;. At the time, some argued that buying sailors out of slavery was a fair exchange to end the war. William Eaton, however, remained bitter for the rest of his life about the treaty, feeling that his efforts had been squandered by the American emissary from the United States Department of State, diplomat Tobias Lear. Eaton and others felt that the capture of Derna should have been used as a bargaining chip to obtain the release of all American prisoners without having to pay ransom. Furthermore, Eaton believed the honor of the United States had been compromised when it abandoned Hamet Karamanli after promising to restore him as leader of Tripoli. Eaton&#x27;s complaints generally went unheard, especially as attention turned to the strained international relations which would ultimately lead to the withdrawal of the United States Navy from the area in 1807 and to the War of 1812.

The First Barbary War was beneficial to the reputation of the United States&#x27; military command and war mechanism, which had been up to that time relatively untested. The First Barbary War showed that the United States could execute a war far from home, and that American forces had the cohesion to fight together as Americans rather than separately as Georgians, New Yorkers, etc. The United States Navy and United States Marine Corps became a permanent part of the United States government and United States history, and Decatur returned to the United States as its first post-revolutionary war hero.

However, the more immediate problem of Barbary piracy was not fully settled. By 1807, Algiers had reassembled its fleets and resumed taking American ships and seamen hostage. Distracted by the preludes to the War of 1812, the United States was unable to respond to the provocation until 1815, with the Second Barbary War, in which naval victories by Commodores William Bainbridge and Stephen Decatur led to treaties ending all tribute payments by the United States.

==Monument==

The &quot;Tripoli Monument&quot;, the oldest military monument in the United States, honors the American heroes of the First Barbary War: Somers—by then promoted to the rank of master commandant–Lieutenant James Caldwell, James Decatur (brother of Stephen Decatur), Henry Wadsworth, Joseph Israel and John Dorsey. Originally known as the &quot;Naval Monument&quot;, it was carved of Carrara marble in Italy in 1806 and brought to the United States on board &quot;Constitution&quot; (&quot;Old Ironsides&quot;). From its original location in the Washington Navy Yard, it was moved to the west terrace of the national Capitol and finally, in 1860, to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.

<text>The Barbary Wars were a series of two wars fought by the United States, Sweden, and the Kingdom of Sicily against the Barbary states (including Tunis, Algiers, and Tripoli) and Morocco of North Africa in the early 19th century. Sweden had been at war with the Tripolitans since 1800 and was joined by the newly independent US. The First Barbary War extended from 10 May 1801 to 10 June 1805, with the Second Barbary War lasting only three days, ending on 19 June 1815. The Barbary Wars were the first major American wars fought entirely outside the New World, and in the Arab World.

The wars were largely a reaction to piracy by the Barbary states. Since the 16th century, North African pirates had captured ships and even raided European coastal areas across the Mediterranean Sea. Originally starting out with the goal of capturing individuals for the domestic North African slave trade, the focus later shifted to kidnapping for ransom. By the 19th century, pirate activity had declined, but Barbary pirates continued to demand tribute from American merchant vessels in the Mediterranean. Refusal to pay would result in the capture of American ships and goods, and often the enslavement or ransoming of crew members.

After Thomas Jefferson became president of the US in March 1801, he sent a U.S. Navy fleet to the Mediterranean to combat the Barbary pirates. The fleet bombarded numerous fortified cities in present-day Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria, ultimately extracting concessions of safe conduct from the Barbary states and ending the first war. 

During the War of 1812, with the encouragement of the United Kingdom, the Barbary corsairs resumed their attacks on American vessels. Following the conclusion of the War of 1812 and America&#x27;s peace with Britain, James Madison, Jefferson&#x27;s successor, directed military forces against the Barbary states in the Second Barbary War. Lasting only three days, the second conflict ended the need for further tribute from the United States, granted the U.S. full shipping rights in the Mediterranean Sea, and significantly reduced incidents of piracy in the region.

==Background==
The Barbary corsairs were pirates and privateers who operated out of North Africa, based primarily in the ports of Tunis, Tripoli, and Algiers. This area was known in Europe as the Barbary Coast, in reference to the Berbers. The corsairs predation covered the Mediterranean, and extended south along West Africa&#x27;s Atlantic, even to the eastern coast of Brazil, into the North Atlantic Ocean raiding the coasts of Ireland and western Britain, and going as far north as Iceland, but they primarily operated in the western Mediterranean. In addition to seizing ships, they engaged in &quot;razzias&quot;, raids on European coastal towns and villages, mainly in Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal, but also in England, Scotland, the Netherlands, Ireland, and as far away as Iceland. The main purpose of their attacks was to capture Europeans for the slave market in North Africa.

The Barbary states were nominally part of the Ottoman Empire, but in practice they were operating independently and the Ottoman government in Constantinople was not involved.

===Attacks===
Since the 1600s, the Barbary pirates had attacked British shipping along the northern coast of Africa, holding captives for ransom or enslaving them. Ransoms were generally raised by families and local church groups, including the Roman Catholic Church. The British became familiar with captivity narratives written by Barbary pirates&#x27; prisoners and slaves.

During the American Revolutionary War, the pirates attacked American ships. On December 20, 1777, Morocco&#x27;s sultan Mohammed III declared that merchant ships of the new American nation would be under the protection of the sultanate and could thus enjoy safe passage into the Mediterranean and along the coast. The Moroccan-American Treaty of Friendship stands as America&#x27;s oldest unbroken friendship treaty with a foreign power. In 1787, Morocco became one of the first nations to recognize the United States.

Starting in the 1780s, realizing that American vessels were no longer under the protection of the British navy, the Barbary pirates seized American ships in the Mediterranean. In 1785, the U.S. had disbanded its Continental Navy and therefore had no seagoing military force, its government agreed in 1786 to pay tribute to stop the attacks. On March 20, 1794, at the urging of President George Washington, Congress voted to authorize the building of six heavy frigates and establish the United States Navy, in order to stop these attacks and the demands for more and more money. The United States had signed treaties with all of the Barbary states after its independence was recognized between 1786 and 1794 to pay tribute in exchange for leaving American merchantmen alone, and by 1797, the United States had paid out $1.25 million or a fifth of the government&#x27;s annual budget in tribute. These demands for tribute imposed a heavy financial drain and by 1799 the U.S. was in arrears of $140,000 to Algiers and some $150,000 to Tripoli. Many Americans resented these payments, arguing that the money would be better spent on a navy that would protect American ships from the attacks of the Barbary pirates, and in the 1800 United States presidential election, Thomas Jefferson won against incumbent second President John Adams in part by noting that the United States was &quot;subjected to the spoliations of foreign cruisers&quot; and was humiliated by paying &quot;an enormous tribute to the petty tyrant of Algiers&quot;.

==History==

=== United States Mediterranean policy ===
After Spain concluded a peace treaty with Algiers in 1785, the Algerian corsair captains entered the waters of the Atlantic and attacked American ships, refusing to release them except for large sums of money. Two American ships, the schooner &quot;Maria&quot;, and the &quot;Dauphin&quot; were captured by Algerian pirates in July 1785 and the survivors forced into slavery, their ransom set at $60,000. A rumor that Benjamin Franklin, who was en route from France to Philadelphia about that time, had been captured by Barbary pirates, caused considerable upset in the U.S.

Thomas Jefferson, who was elected to the presidency twice, was inclined to the idea of confronting Algiers with force. He wrote in his autobiography:

A proposal was made to put up a coalition of naval warships from nations at war with the Barbary states, provided that naval operations would be directed against Algerian vessels in particular, and then impose a maritime blockade on North Africa. When this proposal was presented to the concerned countries, France refused, and Spain apologized for not accepting it, because of its recent treaty with Algiers. The proposal was favored by Portugal, Malta, Naples, Venice, Denmark and Sweden. But the project failed when the US Congress objected to it for fear of its high financial costs, and more Algerian ships attacked American ships because of their lack of association with Algiers by any treaty in this period. Thus, on February 1, 1791, the US Congress was forced to allocate $40,000 to free American captives in Algiers. But two years later, it passed the &quot;Naval Act of 1794&quot; on the need to establish a defensive naval fleet, but stipulated in one of its articles that the project be stopped if an agreement was reached with Algiers.

During the presidency of George Washington (April 30, 1789 – 1797), and after America failed to form an American-European alliance against the Maghreb countries, the U.S. announced its desire to establish friendly relations with Algiers in February 1792, and reported this to the Dey Hassan III Pasha, like how Great Britain bought peace and security for its ships.

=== United States pays tribute to Algiers ===

When the American government began negotiating with Algiers, the Dey asked for $2,435,000 as the price for the peace contract and the ransom of the prisoners, then reduced the amount to $642,500 and $21,000 in military equipment that is presented to Algiers every year. Reconciliation took place between the two parties, and the &quot;dey&quot; pledged to work with Tunisia and Tripoli, to also sign this treaty, and peace would be achieved for America in the entire Mediterranean basin. On September 5, 1795, American negotiator Joseph Donaldson signed a peace treaty with the &quot;dey&quot; of Algiers, with 22 articles that included an upfront payment of $642,500 in specie (&quot;silver coinage&quot;) for peace, the release of American captives, expenses, and various gifts for the &quot;dey&#x27;s&quot; royal court and family. America suffered another humiliation when it sent tribute carried by the large armed frigate &quot;USS &quot;George Washington&quot; (1798)&quot; to Algiers; Dey Mustapha Pasha forced US commodore William Bainbridge to hoist an Ottoman Algerian flag over his warship before sailing to Constantinople carrying tribute to the Ottoman sultan in 1800. As Lieutenant and consul William Eaton informed newly appointed Secretary of State John Marshall in 1800, &quot;It is a maxim of the Barbary States, that &#x27;The Christians who would be on good terms with them must fight well or pay well.&#x27;&quot; 

America paid to Algiers during the presidency of George Washington and his successor, John Adams (1797-1801), $1,000,000, or a fifth of the government&#x27;s annual budget, in tribute.

===First Barbary War (1801–1805)===
The First Barbary War (1801–1805), also known as the Tripolitian War or the Barbary Coast War, was the first of two wars fought by the alliance of the United States and several European countries against the Northwest African Muslim states known collectively as the Barbary states. These were Tripoli and Algiers, quasi-independent entities nominally belonging to the Ottoman Empire, and (briefly) the independent Sultanate of Morocco. This war began during Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s term when he refused to pay an amount that greatly increased when he became president. A U.S. naval fleet was sent on May 13, 1801, under the command of Commodore Richard Dale. Other notable officers in the fleet included Stephen Decatur, assigned to the frigate and William Bainbridge in command of &quot;Essex&quot; which was attached to Commodore Richard Dale&#x27;s squadron which also included , and .The ship &quot;Philadelphia&quot; was blockading Tripoli&#x27;s harbor when she ran aground on an uncharted reef. Under fire from shore batteries and Tripolitan gunboats, Captain William Bainbridge tried to refloat her by casting off all of her guns and other objects that weighed her down. The ship was eventually captured and the crew taken prisoners and enslaved. To prevent this powerful warship from being used by the Barbary pirates, the ship was later destroyed by a raiding party of American Marines and soldiers and allied sailors from the armed forces of King Ferdinand of Sicily, led by Stephen Decatur.

A treaty was reached on June 30, 1805, under which America paid Algiers $60,000 ransom for the prisoners, and agreed to continue sending gifts to the &quot;dey&quot; and replace its consul with another one, then withdrew its fleet from the Mediterranean in 1807. 

=== Second Barbary war ===
When the war broke out between America and Britain in 1812, the regent on the British throne, George IV, sent a letter to Dey Haji Ali Pasha (1809-1815) confirming to him the bonds of friendship that united the two countries and declaring his country&#x27;s readiness to defend Algiers against every aggressor as long as these ties remained. By that he intended to win over Algiers to Britain against America, or at least convince Algiers to adopt a position of neutrality. Thus, the countries of Europe and the United States of America failed to ally against the countries of the Islamic Maghreb and Algiers in particular, and the matter so remained until the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815. James Madison recommended that Congress declare the &quot;existence of a state of war between the United States and the Dey and Regency of Algiers.&quot; While Congress did not formally declare a state of war, they did pass legislation, enacted on March 3, 1815, that authorized the president to use the U.S. Navy, &quot;as judged requisite by the President&quot; to protect the &quot;commerce and seamen&quot; of the United States on the &quot;Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean and adjoining seas.&quot; Congress also authorized the president to grant the U.S. Navy the ability to seize all vessels and goods belonging to Algiers. The legislation also authorized the president to commission privateers for the same purpose.

During the reign of the Dey Omar Pasha (1815-1817), American-Algerian relations worsened when the Dey began to demand an increase in the annual tribute. The Americans went to Algiers to fight under Commodore Stephen Decatur, which culminated in the Battle off Cape Gata and the death of the famous corsair captain Raïs Hamidou. A letter to the &quot;dey&quot; followed on April 12, 1815 informing him of America&#x27;s decision to enter into war against him and giving him the choice between peace and war after reminding him of the horrors of war and the advantages of peace and understanding. In the year 1816, Dey Omar answered this letter and offered America the renewal of the previous treaty concluded during the reign of Hassan Pasha (1791-1798). Madison answered him on August 21 and asked him to resume negotiations. These were renewed and ended with a peace agreement in favor of America. The &quot;dey&quot; was forced to pay $10,000 in compensation and to renounce all that America had been paying him.

==Effect in United States==

When the United States military efforts of the early 19th century were successful against the pirates, partisans of the Democratic-Republicans contrasted their presidents&#x27; refusals to buy off the pirates by paying tribute with the failure of the preceding Federalist administration to suppress the piracy. The Federalist Party had adopted the slogan, &quot;Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute,&quot; but had failed to end the attacks on merchant ships. From 1796 to 1797 French raiders seized some 316 merchant ships flying American colors. To counter this ongoing advent, three frigates, , and , were built to answer the call for security.

<doc id="268412" wikidata="Q1548611" url="?curid=268412" title="Game of the Goose">
<text>The Game of the Goose, also known as the Royal Game of the Goose is one of the first board games to be commercially manufactured. It is a race game, relying only on dice throws to dictate progression of the players. The board is often arranged in the form of a spiral, with game pieces starting on the most outward part. All spaces on the game board are numbered, with some depicting an illustration of either a goose or a hazard indicating a specified action. The aim of the game is to reach the 63rd space before any of the other players, while avoiding hazards such as the Hotel, the Bridge, and Death.

The game is thought to have originated in Italy during the 15th century, being given by Francesco de Medici as a gift to King Philip of Spain. In the 17th and 18th century, the game gained immense popularity throughout Europe. The game&#x27;s popularity led it to different adaptations throughout Europe and the United States. Despite numerous adaptations, the rules have mostly remained the same throughout the years.

==History==
The game&#x27;s origins are uncertain but are thought to originate from Italy and from inspiration of other spiral board games. It is claimed to be the first modern board game. According to board game historian, Adrien Seville, the earliest recorded mention of the game was in a book of sermons by the Dominican friar Gabriele da Barletta published in 1480. A version of the game was given as a gift by Grand Duke Francesco I de&#x27; Medici of Tuscany to King Philip II of Spain sometime between 1574 and 1587. Since then, it has been in production. In the 15th century, it was largely considered as a gambling game. By the 17th century the game was played across many European countries with various models of the game. At this time, it was manufactured using wood by Dutch printers. By the 19th century, the game was marketed as a children’s game.

Some connect the game with the Phaistos Disc because of its spiral shape but, as Caroline Goodfellow notes, the two games &quot;are unlikely to have been the same&quot;. In June 1597 John Wolfe enters the game in the Stationers&#x27; Register, as &quot;the newe and most pleasant game of the goose&quot;. Another theory links the game to the Pilgrims&#x27; Way to Santiago, or the Road to Saint James of Compostela, in Galicia. According to this hypothesis, the game was invented by the Knights Templar, who were in charge of protecting those on pilgrimage to the main holy cities: Compostela, Rome and Jerusalem.

The oldest board for Game of the Goose can be found today in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. This board has a 15th century Italian influence concerning the design of the game but the actual construction of the board has a wood, ivory and gold influence similar to that of 16th century North India. This board follows most of the classical descriptions of the game but with a few differences concerning the hazard spaces. In 2017, another board made its way to the Paris gallery of Sylvie L’Hermite-King. This board goes back to the late 16th century to the Portuguese State of North India. Game of the Goose made its way to Asia through Portuguese ships sailing to India. Boards made in India at the time were considered to be highly treasured in Europe.  

== Symbolism ==
According to Christine Damste, he game was created with the intent to symbolize the fate humans experience in life. The significance of having 63 playing squares represents the &quot;Grand Climacteric&quot; signifying the crucial years of life. Nine is the ruling number of the game, perhaps because it is a perfect square, giving the game a mystical connection. The Hazard spaces of the game also have meaning associated with them: The Bridge is thought to represent a rite of passage; the Hotel represents the earth; Death refers to a new start; the Maze represents something wrong, and the Well and Prison indicate that help is required. In Italy, geese are considered lucky symbols; however, there are many plausible theories that have been proposed to the significance of geese.

== Board ==
Although there have been countless variants of the gameboard over time, it has managed to maintain a consistent form. The gameboard&#x27;s &quot;standard form&quot; consists of a track with 63 consecutively numbered spaces arranged in a spiral, 13 of which are goose-spaces and 6 of which are hazard spaces. The hazard spaces include The Bridge, The Hotel, The Well, The Maze, The Prison and Death. Players begin on the outermost square of the spiral and advance inwards.

Depicted by a drawing of a goose, landing on one allows the player to advance further by the same number of spaces they had thrown. While these spaces are considered the most favourable, landing on one can also have unintended consequences. To win the game, a player must roll a number that lands them exactly on the 63rd space. Should they overthrow, they must move backward by the amount they overstepped. Should the player land on a goose as they move backward, they must move further back by the amount they initially overstepped with the possibility of hitting a hazard space. The standard form of the game shows a goose on spaces 5, 9, 14, 18, 23, 27, 32, 36, 41, 45, 50, 54, 59 and on 63, the winning space.

=== The hazard spaces ===

==== The Bridge ====
Depicted by a drawing of a bridge, this space acts as a shortcut which moves the player to some other specified position. The standard form of the game shows The Bridge on space 6; landing on it moves the player to space 12.

==== The Hotel ====
Depicted by a drawing of a hotel, landing on this space requires the player to remain on the space and miss one turn. The standard form of the game shows The Hotel on space 19.

==== The Well ====
Depicted by a drawing of a well, landing on this space leaves the player stuck there until another player arrives to pull them out—that player then takes their place. The standard form of the game shows The Well on space 31.

==== The Maze ====
Depicted by a drawing of a maze, landing on this space forces the player to move backward to a specified space. The standard form of the game depicts The Maze on space 42.

==== The Prison ====
Depicted by a drawing of a prison, landing on this space leaves the player trapped there until another player arrives to release them—that player then takes their place. The standard form of the game shows The Prison on space 52.

==== Death ====
This space is the least favourable of the hazard spaces. Usually depicted by a drawing of a skeleton, landing on this space forces the player to move all the way back to the starting space. According to Adrian Seville, death in the game is not considered physical, but a &quot;death of the soul&quot;. The standard form of the game shows Death on space 58.

== Equipment ==
A standard set of the &quot;Game of the Goose&quot; includes one gameboard, four goose-shaped pieces of different colours and two six-sided dice.

== Rules ==
Each player begins with their token placed on the first tile. The game can be played by a minimum of two people and requires two six-sided dice. Players alternate by rolling the dice and moving their pieces by the amount given by the sum of the two dice. The player who rolls the highest on the first round goes first; however, there are special cases. If the first throw is a six and a three, the piece moves to space 26, or if the first throw is a five and a four, the piece moves to space 53. This rule was created to avoid the case in which a player throws a 9 in the first round, leading to an instant win, given that landing a goose space allows the player to advance forward by the number they had rolled, and a goose appears every nine spaces. This would lead the player to instantly reach the 63rd space.

To win the game, a player must be the first to reach the 63rd space on an exact throw. Should a player overthrow, they must move backward from the 63rd space by the amount they overthrew. Should the player subsequently land on a goose space after moving backward, they must move backward by the amount thrown, with the possibility of again landing on a goose or on a hazard space. Two players cannot exist on the same square. Should a player land on a square already occupied by an opponent, they must swap places.

There are other special spaces one must pay attention to when playing the game: if one lands on space 6 (the Bridge), the piece must move to square 12; if one lands on space 19 (the Hotel), one must miss one turn; if one lands on space 31 (the Well), one must wait until another player lands on the same square, and get your place; if one lands on space 42 (the Maze), the player goes back to space 39; if one lands on space 52 (the Prison), one must wait for someone to release one, and take one&#x27;s place; if one lands on space 58 (Death), one must restart the game.

==In worldwide culture==

* In Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s comic opera &quot;La Belle Hélène&quot;, the Greek Kings sing about and play a Game of the Goose and argue over cheating.
* In his 1899 novel &quot;Le Testament d’un excentrique&quot;, Jules Verne uses the United States as a giant real-life Game of the Goose board, on which seven players race each other in pursuit of a $60,000,000 inheritance.
* In Roger Martin du Gard&#x27;s novel &quot;The Thibaults&quot;, Monsieur Chasle, the proprietor of a store that markets various inventions, mentions that one of his designers has created a portable &quot;jeu de l&#x27;Oie des Alliés&quot; imprinted with scenes from the Battle of the Marne, Douaumont, and other battles of World War I.
* In Ursula Dubosarsky&#x27;s novel for children, &quot;The Game of the Goose&quot; (Penguin Australia 2000), three children find an old copy of the Game of the Goose in a Salvation Army store, and have magically transforming adventures while playing it.
* The game was the basis for a game and stunt show in Italy named &quot;Il Grande Gioco Dell&#x27;Oca&quot; (&quot;The Great Game of the Goose&quot;), as well as the near-identical Spanish version, &quot;El gran juego de la oca&quot; (same). The Spanish version ran from 1993 to 1995, and again in 1998 as &quot;El nuevo juego de la oca&quot; (&quot;The New Game of the Goose&quot;).
* In Jacques Rivette&#x27;s film, &quot;Le Pont du Nord&quot;, the game is described by the main character, Marie Lafée. The game itself provides the plot structure.

== Variations ==

===France===

Educational race games based on the &quot;Game of the Goose&quot; are a French invention of the 17th century. The earliest known adaptation is Pierre Marriette&#x27;s &quot;Jeu Chronologique&quot; dated 1638, with the purpose of teaching History. Successive versions taught geography, the arts of war, and heraldry, produced from expensively engraved copper plates as opposed to the provincial productions of games from woodcut blocks. These games retained the essential structure of the “Game of the Goose,” rewarding good luck and punishing bad luck. However, modifications had the purpose of attracting diverse audiences, such as children, travellers, or those interested in specific activities such as horse racing or hunting.

===England===

A century later, England joined the trend of educational race games with John Jeffreys’ 1759 &quot;A Journey through Europe, or the Play of Geography,&quot; printed by Carington Bowles. The first dated game of this kind marked a significant step in the evolution of educational games to facilitate the teaching of geography in the region. All used a teetotum, rather than dice, to move players around the board and avoid association with gambling.

The 18th-century English game &quot;Courtship and Matrimony&quot; has a track that is 64 spaces long. However, this game has a unique rule for the Prison space at No. 55. If a player of the opposite sex lands on the same space, it simulates a &quot;Fleet marriage,&quot; resulting in an immediate win and a division of the pot. This rule plays on the historical context of rapid marriages that took place in London&#x27;s Fleet Prison.

The 19th century British variation called &quot;The New Royal Game of the Goose&quot; offers a distinct rule at space 57, where a depicted man with a pipe suggests a gendered activity. Any player, unless they are female, are sent back to space 47, hinting at the societal views on smoking as an exclusively masculine activity.

===United States of America===

Crossing the Atlantic, the &quot;Game of the Goose&quot; was tailored once again. In the United States, &quot;The Mansion of Happiness&quot; was published in 1843 as one of the first board games mass-produced in America. The adaptation was designed by Anne Abbott, a clergyman&#x27;s daughter from Beverly, with the purpose of instilling ethical values based on Christian morality. It used gameplay to reflect the lively path to happiness. An introductory verse in the instructions makes this clear:

&quot;At this amusement each will find&quot;
&quot;A moral to improve the mind.&quot;
&quot;It gives to those their proper due&quot;
&quot;Who various paths of vice pursue, And shows (while vice destruction brings)&quot;
&quot;That Good from every Virtue springs.&quot;
&quot;Be virtuous then and forward press&quot;
&quot;To gain the seat of Happiness&quot;

===Germany===

Meanwhile, In Germany, around 1933, the “Reise durch Deutschland” (Tour of Germany) was published. At first glance, it mirrored Swiss games designed in the late 19th century to promote tourism, but its purpose was evidently more profound. The game carried a political message, reflecting on the division of Germany after the Treaty of Versailles. It featured depictions of rural workers in traditional attire and opened with a reference to the first Reichstag by Hitler.

===Netherlands===

A Dutch variation published in 1858 called &quot;Sint Nicolaas,&quot; involves the initial dice throw to affect the gameplay differently based on the player&#x27;s gender. An initial throw of 6 and 3 moves male players to space 25 and female players to space 26, each marked by images of a young man or woman. Conversely, an initial throw of 5 and 4 moves male players to space 51 and female players to space 53, marked with images of an older man or woman, with the implication of being past marriageable age.

===Male / Female Rules===

Historical variations of the “Game of the Goose” often reflect the cultural norms and gender roles of their times through the rules that differ according to the gender of the player.

<doc id="268415" wikidata="Q6858030" url="?curid=268415" title="Milk &amp; Kisses">
<text>Milk &amp; Kisses is the eighth and final studio album by Scottish rock band Cocteau Twins, released on 15 April 1996 in the United Kingdom by Fontana Records and on 14 May 1996 in the United States by Capitol Records. It proved to be their last; a meeting two years later to record a new album ended with the breakup of the band.

==Background==

Commenting on the inspiration for the title &quot;Milk &amp; Kisses&quot; for the album, lead singer Elizabeth Fraser said &quot;a friend was kind of comforting me on the phone and they were just being so sweet, really. They had empathy for what I was going through, and they said, &#x27;I wish I could get the poison out of you. I wish I could just take it out of you and replace it with milk and kisses.&#x27; And I just thought that was really brilliant! It&#x27;s beautiful, isn&#x27;t it? I kept hearing it and feeling so good about it, it seemed right to use it&quot;. On the process of the recording of the album, Robin Guthrie claimed &quot;making this record was a very joyous experience. It only took two months to record, which for us is amazing. Simon used to come into the studio in the daytime to do his thing, then I would come in at night to do mine, and then Liz would come in when neither one of us was around. We were never in the studio at the same time. This time, we really were together much of the time&quot;. Raymonde later recalled of &quot;Milk &amp; Kisses&quot; &quot;the brilliant thing about this album is that it all happened so fast. Robin and I would write a song and then not have to wait around forever the muse to visit Liz&quot;.

The song &quot;Rilkean Heart&quot; was an homage to Jeff Buckley, who was a lifelong lover of the work of poet Rainer Maria Rilke.

The Japanese edition of &quot;Milk &amp; Kisses&quot; contains two bonus tracks—&quot;Flock of Soul&quot; and &quot;Primitive Heart&quot;. The Hong Kong edition contains a duet version of &quot;Serpentskirt&quot; sung by Elizabeth Fraser with C-pop artist Faye Wong. Wong later recorded an acoustic version of &quot;Rilkean Heart&quot; for her 1997 album &quot;Faye Wong&quot;, on which Guthrie and Raymonde also wrote a new song, &quot;Yu Le Chang&quot; (&quot;Amusement Park&quot;), for her. In 2013, Sarah Brightman covered their song &quot;Eperdu&quot; on her album &quot;Dreamchaser&quot;.

==Recording==
The band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Four Calendar Cafe&quot; (1993), was recorded and released following the end of Fraser&#x27;s and Guthrie&#x27;s 13-year relationship. Fearing they would be unable to work together, each member had attempted to avoid the others, recording sessions in the studio independently. By 1995, the band seemed to be in a position where they were willing to work and spend time together again, and the recording process for &quot;Milk and Kisses&quot; was a lot smoother and more productive. &quot;We worked quite closely together on this record, which we hadn&#x27;t done so much on the previous one&quot; stated Raymonde. &quot;Robin and Liz had broken up and it was a complex time. But I actually think the band was in a really good place during Milk &amp; Kisses. Some time had passed and they were both in relationships with different people. All of the rawness was gone from their relationship. Ironically, Liz left a year or so after we finished it.&quot;

An alternate Chinese version of the song &quot;Serpentskirt&quot; on the album was recorded by Faye Wong (Wangfei), and featuring lead singer of Cocteau Twins, Elizabeth Fraser, featuring on backing vocals. Wong also recorded a version of &quot;Rilkean Heart&quot;, also from &quot;Milk &amp; Kisses&quot;.

==Release and performance==
The album was released by Fontana Records, their second release under the label following the release of their 1993 studio album &quot;Four Calendar Cafe&quot;. The album was released during a time of pressure and fragmented relations between the band and their label, with bassist Simon Raymonde claiming that the band should &quot;never have signed the deal&quot;, claiming that the record label worked in a very different manner than that of the band, and that the Cocteau Twins were unable to replicate previous sales and success, which appeared to be a disappointment to the record label.

Speaking during the 25th anniversary of the albums release in 2021, bassist Simon Raymonde stated &quot;I don&#x27;t think the recordings [on &quot;Milk and Kisses&quot;] are anywhere near the best we did by any stretch of the imagination. I think the songwriting was good, but I always felt the record sounded muffled. The remastering has actually helped that, which is something I almost never say. I do have a lot of great memories of it, because as you know it turned out to be our last record.&quot;

Critically, &quot;Milk &amp; Kisses&quot; received generally positive reviews, with &quot;AllMusic&quot; claiming &quot;Milk &amp; Kisses finds the band in a comfortable rut; they&#x27;ve created, and now perfected, a style of music so distinctive that there seems to be little recent creative growth. The result is a beautiful, lush, but somewhat dated and unengaging sounding album that tends to wash over the listener without making any real impact. It is, however, everything that a Cocteau Twins album promises; hypnotic, dreamy, awash in ethereal voices, and delicate, liquid guitars&quot;.

<doc id="268416" wikidata="Q1345267" url="?curid=268416" title="Suntory">
<text>(commonly referred to as simply Suntory) is a Japanese multinational brewing and distilling company group. Established in 1899, it is one of the oldest companies in the distribution of alcoholic beverages in Japan, and makes Japanese whisky. 

Its business has expanded to other fields, and the company now also makes soft drinks and operates sandwich chains. With its 2014 acquisition of Beam, Inc., it has diversified internationally and become the third largest maker of distilled beverages in the world. Suntory is headquartered in Dojimahama 2-chome, Kita-ku, Osaka, Osaka Prefecture. 

==History==
Suntory was started by , who first opened his store in Osaka on February 1, 1899, to sell imported wines. In 1907, the store began selling a fortified wine called Akadama Port Wine (Akadama literally meaning &quot;red ball,&quot; a euphemism for the sun). The store became the Kotobukiya company in 1921 to further expand its business and in 1923, Torii built Japan&#x27;s first malt whisky distillery Yamazaki Distillery. 

Due to shortages during World War II, Kotobukiya was forced to halt its development of new products, but in 1946 it re-released Torys Whisky, which sold well in post-war Japan. In 1961, Kotobukiya launched the &quot;Drink Torys and Go to Hawaii&quot; campaign. At the time, a trip abroad was considered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. In 1963, Kotobukiya changed its name to &quot;Suntory&quot;, taken from the name of the whisky it produces, which itself was derived from the English &quot;Sun&quot; (referencing &quot;akadama&quot;) + Tory, the anglicized version of Torii&#x27;s name. In the same year, Musashino Beer Factory began its production of the Suntory Beer. 

On April 1, 2009, Suntory became a stockholding company named and established , , , , , , and .

On July 14, 2009, Kirin announced that it was negotiating with Suntory on a merger. On February 8, 2010, it was announced that negotiations between the two were terminated.

In 2009, Suntory acquired Orangina-Schweppes, the owner of the orange soft drink Orangina, for 300 billion yen, and Frucor energy drinks for 600 million euros. On July 2, 2013, the company debuted on the Tokyo stock exchange and raised almost US$4 billion in the process.

In September 2013, Suntory purchased the drinks division of GlaxoSmithKline. This included the brands Lucozade and Ribena, however, the deal did not include Horlicks.

In January 2014, Suntory announced an agreement to buy the largest U.S. bourbon producer, Beam Inc. (producers of Jim Beam) for US$16 billion. This deal would make Suntory the world&#x27;s third largest spirits maker. The acquisition was completed in April 2014, when it was announced that the new subsidiary would be renamed Beam Suntory. 

In December 2016, Beam Suntory acquired the gin maker Sipsmith.

In November 2017, Suntory and PepsiCo form a joint venture in Thailand.

In 2018, Suntory sold most of Cerebos Pacific assets, including Australian and New Zealand food business to Kraft Heinz for A$290 million. This transaction excludes Cerebos Pacific&#x27;s health supplements and fresh coffee business which later integrated into Suntory Beverage &amp; Food Asia Pte. Ltd. and Suntory Coffee Australia respectively.

In March 2023, Makiko Ono became the first woman to be appointed CEO of Suntory Beverage &amp; Food Ltd.

In May 2024, Beam Suntory was re-branded as Suntory Global Spirits including the launch of a new website and visual identity.

From the early 1990s, Suntory has collaborated extensively with Melbourne biotechnology firm Florigene to genetically engineer the world&#x27;s first true blue rose, a symbol often associated with the impossible or unattainable. In 1991, the team won the intense global race to isolate the gene responsible for blue flowers, and has since developed a range of genetically modified flowers expressing colors in the blue spectrum, as well as a number of other breakthroughs extending the vase life of cut flowers.

In 2003, Suntory acquired a 98.5% equity holding in Florigene. Prior to this, Florigene had been a subsidiary of global agrochemicals giant Nufarm since 1999. In July 2004, Suntory and Florigene scientists announced to the world the development of the first roses containing blue pigment, an important step toward the creation of a truly blue colored rose.

In July 2011, Suntory Beverage and Food Limited together with PT GarudaFood from Tudung Group in Indonesia have agreed to make a new firm to produce non-alcoholic drink with 51 percent and 49 percent shares respectively. It will produce Suntory Oolong Tea, Boss and Orangina.

In April 2019, Suntory partnered with Drinkripples, an Israeli-based company. As part of the collaboration Suntory will use Drinkripples&#x27; Ripple Maker machines to print branded and viral content on top of Suntory beer in Suntory certified locations and factories throughout Japan.

==Media and advertising==
* Suntory was one of the first East Asian companies to specifically employ American celebrities to market their product. One of the most notable is Sammy Davis Jr., who appeared in a series of Suntory commercials in the early 1970s. In the late 1970s, Akira Kurosawa directed a series of commercials featuring American celebrities on the set of his film &quot;Kagemusha&quot;. One of these featured Francis Ford Coppola (an executive producer of the film), which later inspired his daughter Sofia Coppola in her writing of &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;, a film which focuses on an American actor (played by Bill Murray) filming a Suntory commercial in Tokyo for the &quot;Hibiki&quot; whisky.
* Suntory operates two museums, the Suntory Museum of Art in Tokyo and the Suntory Museum Tempozan in Osaka, in addition to a number of cultural and social programs across Japan.
* In the 1970s, Suntory engaged the US pop group the Carpenters to advertise its new line of soft drinks.
* Suntory is a former sponsor of the professional match play golf tournament, played annually at Wentworth Club, near London.
* In 2023 for Suntory&#x27;s 100th year anniversary, and 20 years after the appearance of &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;, director Sofia Coppola was asked to direct the company&#x27;s anniversary tribute video starring Keanu Reeves, with a mix that included scenes from her film along with footage of her father and Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s Suntory Whiskey advertisement from the 1970s.

<doc id="268420" wikidata="Q215414" url="?curid=268420" title="Foam">
<text>Foams are two-phase material systems where a gas is dispersed in a second, non-gaseous material, specifically, in which gas cells are enclosed by a distinct liquid or solid material. The foam &quot;may contain more or less liquid [or solid] according to circumstances&quot;, although in the case of gas-liquid foams, the gas occupies most of the volume. The word derives from the medieval German and otherwise obsolete &quot;veim&quot;, in reference to the &quot;frothy head forming in the glass once the beer has been freshly poured&quot; (cf. &quot;ausgefeimt&quot;).

Theories regarding foam formation, structure, and properties—in physics and physical chemistry—differ somewhat between liquid and solid foams in that the former are dynamic (e.g., in their being &quot;continuously deformed&quot;), as a result of gas diffusing between cells, liquid draining from the foam into a bulk liquid, etc. Theories regarding liquid foams have as direct analogs theories regarding emulsions, two-phase material systems in which one liquid is enclosed by another.

In most foams, the volume of gas is large, with thin films of liquid or solid separating the regions of gas. A bath sponge and the head on a glass of beer are examples of foams; soap foams are also known as &quot;suds&quot;.

Solid foams can be closed-cell or open-cell. In closed-cell foam, the gas forms discrete pockets, each completely surrounded by the solid material. In open-cell foam, gas pockets connect to each other. A bath sponge is an example of an open-cell foam: water easily flows through the entire structure, displacing the air. A sleeping mat is an example of a product composed of closed-cell foam.

Foams are examples of dispersed media. In general, gas is present, so it divides into gas bubbles of different sizes (i.e., the material is polydisperse)—separated by liquid regions that may form films, thinner and thinner when the liquid phase drains out of the system films. When the principal scale is small, i.e., for a very fine foam, this dispersed medium can be considered a type of colloid.

&quot;Foam&quot; can also refer to something that is analogous to foam, such as quantum foam.

==Structure==

A foam is, in many cases, a multi-scale system.
One scale is the bubble: material foams are typically disordered and have a variety of bubble sizes. At larger sizes, the study of idealized foams is closely linked to the mathematical problems of minimal surfaces and three-dimensional tessellations, also called honeycombs. The Weaire–Phelan structure is reported in one primary philosophical source to be the best possible (optimal) unit cell of a perfectly ordered foam, while Plateau&#x27;s laws describe how soap-films form structures in foams.

At lower scale than the bubble is the thickness of the film for metastable foams, which can be considered a network of interconnected films called lamellae. Ideally, the lamellae connect in triads and radiate 120° outward from the connection points, known as Plateau borders. 

An even lower scale is the liquid–air interface at the surface of the film. Most of the time this interface is stabilized by a layer of amphiphilic structure, often made of surfactants, particles (Pickering emulsion), or more complex associations.

==Formation==

Several conditions are needed to produce foam: there must be mechanical work, surface active components (surfactants) that reduce the surface tension, and the formation of foam faster than its breakdown.
To create foam, work (W) is needed to increase the surface area (ΔA):

:formula_1

where γ is the surface tension.

One of the ways foam is created is through dispersion, where a large amount of gas is mixed with a liquid. A more specific method of dispersion involves injecting a gas through a hole in a solid into a liquid. If this process is completed very slowly, then one bubble can be emitted from the orifice at a time as shown in the picture below.

One of the theories for determining the separation time is shown below; however, while this theory produces theoretical data that matches the experimental data, detachment due to capillarity is accepted as a better explanation.
The buoyancy force acts to raise the bubble, which is

:formula_2
where formula_3 is the volume of the bubble, formula_4 is the acceleration due to gravity, and ρ1 is the density of the gas ρ2 is the density of the liquid. The force working against the buoyancy force is the surface tension force, which is

:formula_5,
where γ is the surface tension, and formula_6 is the radius of the orifice.
As more air is pushed into the bubble, the buoyancy force grows quicker than the surface tension force. Thus, detachment occurs when the buoyancy force is large enough to overcome the surface tension force. 
:formula_7
In addition, if the bubble is treated as a sphere with a radius of formula_8 and the volume formula_3 is substituted in to the equation above, separation occurs at the moment when
:formula_10

Examining this phenomenon from a capillarity viewpoint for a bubble that is being formed very slowly, it can be assumed that the pressure formula_11 inside is constant everywhere. The hydrostatic pressure in the liquid is designated by formula_12. The change in pressure across the interface from gas to liquid is equal to the capillary pressure; hence,

:formula_13
where R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature and are set as positive. At the stem of the bubble, R3 and R4 are the radii of curvature also treated as positive. Here the hydrostatic pressure in the liquid has to take into account z, the distance from the top to the stem of the bubble. The new hydrostatic pressure at the stem of the bubble is &quot;p&quot;0(&quot;ρ&quot;1 − &quot;ρ&quot;2)&quot;z&quot;. The hydrostatic pressure balances the capillary pressure, which is shown below:

:formula_14

Finally, the difference in the top and bottom pressure equals the change in hydrostatic pressure:

:formula_15
At the stem of the bubble, the shape of the bubble is nearly cylindrical; consequently, either R3 or R4 is large while the other radius of curvature is small. As the stem of the bubble grows in length, it becomes more unstable as one of the radius grows and the other shrinks. At a certain point, the vertical length of the stem exceeds the circumference of the stem and due to the buoyancy forces the bubble separates and the process repeats.

==Stability==

===Stabilization===

The stabilization of foam is caused by van der Waals forces between the molecules in the foam, electrical double layers created by dipolar surfactants, and the Marangoni effect, which acts as a restoring force to the lamellae.

The Marangoni effect depends on the liquid that is foaming being impure. Generally, surfactants in the solution decrease the surface tension. The surfactants also clump together on the surface and form a layer as shown below.

For the Marangoni effect to occur, the foam must be indented as shown in the first picture. This indentation increases the local surface area. Surfactants have a larger diffusion time than the bulk of the solution—so the surfactants are less concentrated in the indentation.

Also, surface stretching makes the surface tension of the indented spot greater than the surrounding area. Consequentially—since the diffusion time for the surfactants is large—the Marangoni effect has time to take place. The difference in surface tension creates a gradient, which instigates fluid flow from areas of lower surface tension to areas of higher surface tension. The second picture shows the film at equilibrium after the Marangoni effect has taken place.

Curing a foam solidifies it, making it indefinitely stable at STP.

===Destabilization===
Witold Rybczynski and Jacques Hadamard developed an equation to calculate the velocity of bubbles that rise in foam with the assumption that the bubbles are spherical with a radius formula_6.

:formula_17

with velocity in units of centimeters per second. ρ1 and ρ2 is the density for a gas and liquid respectively in units of g/cm3 and ῃ1 and ῃ2 is the dynamic 
 viscosity of the gas and liquid respectively in units of g/cm·s and g is the acceleration of gravity in units of cm/s2.

However, since the density and viscosity of a liquid is much greater than the gas, the density and viscosity of the gas can be neglected, which yields the new equation for velocity of bubbles rising as:
:formula_18

However, through experiments it has been shown that a more accurate model for bubbles rising is:
:formula_19

Deviations are due to the Marangoni effect and capillary pressure, which affect the assumption that the bubbles are spherical.
For laplace pressure of a curved gas liquid interface, the two principal radii of curvature at a point are R1 and R2. With a curved interface, the pressure in one phase is greater than the pressure in another phase. The capillary pressure Pc is given by the equation of:

:formula_20,
where formula_21 is the surface tension. The bubble shown below is a gas (phase 1) in a liquid (phase 2) and point A designates the top of the bubble while point B designates the bottom of the bubble. 
At the top of the bubble at point A, the pressure in the liquid is assumed to be p0 as well as in the gas. At the bottom of the bubble at point B, the hydrostatic pressure is:
:formula_22
:formula_23
where ρ1 and ρ2 is the density for a gas and liquid respectively. The difference in hydrostatic pressure at the top of the bubble is 0, while the difference in hydrostatic pressure at the bottom of the bubble across the interface is &quot;gz&quot;(&quot;ρ&quot;2 − &quot;ρ&quot;1). Assuming that the radii of curvature at point A are equal and denoted by RA and that the radii of curvature at point B are equal and denoted by RB, then the difference in capillary pressure between point A and point B is:

:formula_24
At equilibrium, the difference in capillary pressure must be balanced by the difference in hydrostatic pressure. Hence,
:formula_25
Since, the density of the gas is less than the density of the liquid the left hand side of the equation is always positive. Therefore, the inverse of RA must be larger than the RB. Meaning that from the top of the bubble to the bottom of the bubble the radius of curvature increases. Therefore, without neglecting gravity the bubbles cannot be spherical. In addition, as z increases, this causes the difference in RA and RB too, which means the bubble deviates more from its shape the larger it grows.

Foam destabilization occurs for several reasons. First, gravitation causes drainage of liquid to the foam base, which Rybczynski and Hadamar include in their theory; however, foam also destabilizes due to osmotic pressure causes drainage from the lamellas to the Plateau borders due to internal concentration differences in the foam, and Laplace pressure causes diffusion of gas from small to large bubbles due to pressure difference. In addition, films can break under disjoining pressure, These effects can lead to rearrangement of the foam structure at scales larger than the bubbles, which may be individual (T1 process) or collective (even of the &quot;avalanche&quot; type).

==Mechanical properties==
===Liquid foams===

===Solid foams===
Solid foams, both open-cell and closed-cell, are considered as a sub-class of cellular structures. They often have lower nodal connectivity as compared to other cellular structures like honeycombs and truss lattices, and thus, their failure mechanism is dominated by bending of members. Low nodal connectivity and the resulting failure mechanism ultimately lead to their lower mechanical strength and stiffness compared to honeycombs and truss lattices.

The strength of foams can be impacted by the density, the material used, and the arrangement of the cellular structure (open vs closed and pore isotropy). To characterize the mechanical properties of foams, compressive stress-strain curves are used to measure their strength and ability to absorb energy since this is an important factor in foam based technologies. 

====Elastomeric foam====
For elastomeric cellular solids, as the foam is compressed, first it behaves elastically as the cell walls bend, then as the cell walls buckle there is yielding and breakdown of the material until finally the cell walls crush together and the material ruptures. This is seen in a stress-strain curve as a steep linear elastic regime, a linear regime with a shallow slope after yielding (plateau stress), and an exponentially increasing regime. The stiffness of the material can be calculated from the linear elastic regime where the modulus for open celled foams can be defined by the equation: 

formula_26

where formula_27 is the modulus of the solid component, formula_28 is the modulus of the honeycomb structure, formula_29 is a constant having a value close to one, formula_30 is the density of the honeycomb structure, and formula_31 is the density of the solid. The elastic modulus for closed cell foams can be described similarly by:

formula_32

where the only difference is the exponent in the density dependence. However, in real materials, a closed-cell foam has more material at the cell edges which makes it more closely follow the equation for open-cell foams. The ratio of the density of the honeycomb structure compared with the solid structure has a large impact on the modulus of the material. Overall, foam strength increases with density of the cell and stiffness of the matrix material.

====Energy of deformation====
Another important property which can be deduced from the stress strain curve is the energy that the foam is able to absorb. The area under the curve (specified to be before rapid densification at the peak stress), represents the energy in the foam in units of energy per unit volume. The maximum energy stored by the foam prior to rupture is described by the equation: 

formula_33

This equation is derived from assuming an idealized foam with engineering approximations from experimental results. Most energy absorption occurs at the plateau stress region after the steep linear elastic regime.

====Directional dependence====
The isotropy of the cellular structure and the absorption of fluids can also have an impact on the mechanical properties of a foam. If there is anisotropy present, then the materials response to stress will be directionally dependent, and thus the stress-strain curve, modulus, and energy absorption will vary depending on the direction of applied force. Also, open-cell structures which have connected pores can allow water or other liquids to flow through the structure, which can also affect the rigidity and energy absorption capabilities.

==Applications==
===Liquid foams===
Liquid foams can be used in fire retardant foam, such as those that are used in extinguishing fires, especially oil fires.

The dough of leavened bread has traditionally been understood as a closed-cell foam—yeast causing bread to rise via tiny bubbles of gas that become the bread pores—where the cells do not connect with each other. Cutting the dough releases the gas in the bubbles that are cut, but the gas in the rest of the dough cannot escape. When dough is allowed to rise too far, it becomes an open-cell foam, in which the gas pockets are connected; cutting the dough surface at that point would cause a large volume of gas to escape, and the dough to collapse. Recent research has indicated that the pore structure in bread is 99% interconnected into one large vacuole, thus the closed-cell foam of the moist dough is transformed into an open cell solid foam in the bread.

The unique property of gas-liquid foams having very high specific surface area is exploited in the chemical processes of froth flotation and foam fractionation.

====Depopulation====
Foam depopulation or foaming is a means of mass killing farm animals by spraying foam over a large area to obstruct breathing and ultimately cause suffocation. It is usually used to attempt to stop disease spread.

===Solid foams===
Solid foams are a class of lightweight cellular engineering materials. These foams are typically classified into two types based on their pore structure: open-cell-structured foams (also known as reticulated foams) and closed-cell foams. At high enough cell resolutions, any type can be treated as continuous or &quot;continuum&quot; materials and are referred to as cellular solids, with predictable mechanical properties.
Open-cell foams can be used to filter air. For example, a foam embedded with catalyst has been shown to catalytically convert formaldehyde to benign substances when formaldehyde polluted air passes through the open cell structure.

Open-cell-structured foams contain pores that are connected to each other and form an interconnected network that is relatively soft. Open-cell foams fill with whatever gas surrounds them. If filled with air, a relatively good insulator results, but, if the open cells fill with water, insulation properties would be reduced. Recent studies have put the focus on studying the properties of open-cell foams as an insulator material. Wheat gluten/TEOS bio-foams have been produced, showing similar insulator properties as for those foams obtained from oil-based resources. Foam rubber is a type of open-cell foam.
Closed-cell foams do not have interconnected pores. The closed-cell foams normally have higher compressive strength due to their structures. However, closed-cell foams are also, in general more dense, require more material, and as a consequence are more expensive to produce. The closed cells can be filled with a specialized gas to provide improved insulation. The closed-cell structure foams have higher dimensional stability, low moisture absorption coefficients, and higher strength compared to open-cell-structured foams. All types of foam are widely used as core material in sandwich-structured composite materials.

The earliest known engineering use of cellular solids is with wood, which in its dry form is a closed-cell foam composed of lignin, cellulose, and air. From the early 20th century, various types of specially manufactured solid foams came into use. The low density of these foams makes them excellent as thermal insulators and flotation devices and their lightness and compressibility make them ideal as packing materials and stuffings.

An example of the use of azodicarbonamide as a blowing agent is found in the manufacture of vinyl (PVC) and EVA-PE foams, where it plays a role in the formation of air bubbles by breaking down into gas at high temperature.

The random or &quot;stochastic&quot; geometry of these foams makes them good for energy absorption, as well. In the late 20th century to early 21st century, new manufacturing techniques have allowed for geometry that results in excellent strength and stiffness per weight. These new materials are typically referred to as engineered cellular solids.

====Syntactic foam====
====Integral skin foam====

&quot;Integral skin foam&quot;, also known as &quot;self-skin foam&quot;, is a type of foam with a high-density skin and a low-density core. It can be formed in an &quot;open-mold process&quot; or a &quot;closed-mold process&quot;. In the open-mold process, two reactive components are mixed and poured into an open mold. The mold is then closed and the mixture is allowed to expand and cure. Examples of items produced using this process include arm rests, baby seats, shoe soles, and mattresses. The closed-mold process, more commonly known as &quot;reaction injection molding&quot; (RIM), injects the mixed components into a closed mold under high pressures.

<text>Thomas Hooker (July 5, 1586 – July 7, 1647) was a prominent English colonial leader and Congregational minister, who founded the Connecticut Colony after dissenting with Puritan leaders in Massachusetts. He was known as an outstanding speaker and an advocate of universal Christian suffrage.

Called today &quot;the Father of Connecticut&quot;, Thomas Hooker was a towering figure in the early development of colonial New England. He was one of the great preachers of his time, an erudite writer on Christian subjects, the first minister of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and one of the first settlers and founders of both the city of Hartford and the state of Connecticut. He has been cited by many as the inspiration for the &quot;Fundamental Orders of Connecticut&quot;, which some have described as the world&#x27;s first written democratic constitution establishing a representative government.

==Life==

===Early life===
Thomas Hooker was likely born in Leicestershire at &quot;Marfield&quot; (Marefield or possibly Markfield) or Birstall. He went to Dixie Grammar School at Market Bosworth. Family genealogist Edward Hooker linked Thomas Hooker to the Hooker family in Devon, which produced the theologian and clergyman Richard Hooker. Other Hooker genealogists, however, have traced Thomas Hooker to Leicestershire. Positive evidence linking Thomas to Leicestershire is lacking since the Marefield parish records from before 1610 were lost. Any link to the Rev. Richard Hooker is likewise lacking since the Rev. Thomas&#x27;s personal papers were disposed of and his house destroyed after his death.
===College===
In March 1604, Hooker entered Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge as a sizar but migrated to Emmanuel College. He received his Bachelor of Arts in 1608 and his Master of Arts in 1611. In 1609 he was elected to a Dixie fellowship at Emmanuel.

Hooker was appointed to St George&#x27;s Church, Esher, Surrey in 1620, where he earned a reputation as an excellent speaker. He also became noted for his pastoral care of Mrs. Joan Drake, the wife of the patron. She was a depressive whose stages of spiritual regeneration became a model for his later theological thinking. While associated with the Drake household, he married Susannah Garbrand, Mrs. Drake&#x27;s woman-in-waiting (April 3, 1621) in Amersham, Mrs. Drake&#x27;s birthplace.

Around 1626, Hooker became a lecturer or preacher at what was then St. Mary&#x27;s parish church, Chelmsford (now Chelmsford Cathedral) and curate to its rector, John Michaelson. In 1629 Archbishop William Laud suppressed church lecturers, and Hooker retired to Little Baddow where he kept a school. 

His leadership of Puritan sympathizers brought him a summons to the Court of High Commission. Forfeiting his bond, Hooker fled to Rotterdam in the Netherlands, and considered a position in the English Reformed Church, Amsterdam, as assistant to its senior pastor, the Rev. John Paget. From the Netherlands, after a clandestine trip to England to put his affairs in order, he immigrated to the Massachusetts Bay Colony aboard the &quot;Griffin&quot;.

Hooker arrived in Boston and settled in Newtown (later renamed Cambridge), where he became the pastor of the earliest established church there, known to its members as &quot;The Church of Christ at Cambridge&quot;. His congregation, some of whom may have been members of congregations he had served in England, became known as &quot;Mr. Hooker&#x27;s Company&quot;. For a time he lived in Watertown, Massachusetts, but felt that the towns were too close together. When the General Court of Massachusetts allowed residents to split off and found new communities, his group was among the first to go.
Voting in Massachusetts was limited to freemen, individuals who had been formally admitted to their church after a detailed interrogation of their religious views and experiences. Hooker disagreed with this limitation of suffrage, putting him at odds with the influential pastor John Cotton. 

Owing to his conflict with Cotton, discontented with the suppression of Puritan suffrage, and at odds with the colony leadership, Hooker and the Rev. Samuel Stone led a group of about 100 who, in 1636, founded the settlement of Hartford. It was named for Stone&#x27;s birthplace, Hertford in England.

They founded the Connecticut Colony. Hooker became more active in politics in Connecticut. The General Court representing Wethersfield, Windsor and Hartford met at the end of May 1638 to frame a written constitution in order to establish a government for the commonwealth. Hooker preached the opening sermon at First Church of Hartford on May 31, declaring that &quot;the foundation of authority is laid in the free consent of the people.&quot;

On January 14, 1639, freemen from these three settlements ratified the &quot;Fundamental Orders of Connecticut&quot; in what John Fiske called &quot;the first written constitution known to history that created a government. It marked the beginnings of American democracy, of which Thomas Hooker deserves more than any other man to be called the father. The government of the United States today is in lineal descent more nearly related to that of Connecticut than to that of any of the other thirteen colonies.&quot;

In recognition of this, near Chelmsford Cathedral, Essex, England, where Hooker had been town lecturer and curate, there is a blue plaque fixed high on the wall of a narrow alleyway, opposite the south porch, that reads: &quot;Thomas Hooker, 1586–1647, Curate at St. Mary&#x27;s Church and Chelmsford Town Lecturer 1626–29. Founder of the State of Connecticut, Father of American Democracy.&quot;

==Death and legacy==

Hooker died during the 1647 North American influenza epidemic on July 7, at the age of 61, two days after his birthday. The location of his grave is unknown, although he is believed to be buried in Hartford&#x27;s Ancient Burying Ground. A crypt was erected there; in addition a plaque on the back of the First Church refers to his burial. 

Because there was no known portrait of him, in the 20th century Frances Laughlin Wadsworth used the likenesses of his descendants to sculpt the commissioned statue of Hooker that was erected in 1938 in front of Hartford&#x27;s Old State House.

==Views==

Thomas Hooker strongly advocated extended suffrage to include Puritan worshippers, leading him and his followers to colonize Connecticut. He also promoted the concept of a government that must answer to the people, stating: &quot;[T]hey who have the power to appoint officers and magistrates, it is in their power, also, to set the bounds and limitations of the power and place unto which they call them&quot; through &quot;the privilege of election, which belongs to the people according to the blessed will and law of God&quot;. Hooker argued for greater religious tolerance towards all Christian denominations.

Hooker defended the calling of synods by magistrates, and attended a convention of ministers in Boston whose purpose was to defend Congregationalism. Hooker later published &quot;A Survey of the Summed of Church-Discipline&quot; in defense of Congregationalism, and applied its principles to politics and government.

Thomas Hooker was a prominent proponent of the doctrine of preparationism, which taught that by making use of the means of grace, a &quot;person seeking conversion might dispose himself toward receiving God&#x27;s grace.&quot; He believed that much of God&#x27;s favor needed to be re-earned by men. To Hooker, sin was the most crafty of enemies, defeating grace on most occasions. He disagreed with many of the predecessor theologies of Free Grace theology, preferring a more muted view on the subject. He focused on preparation for heaven and following the moralist character.

==Family==
Thomas Hooker came to the colonies with his second wife, Suzanne. Nothing is known of his first wife.

His son Samuel, likely born at Cambridge, Massachusetts, graduated from Harvard College in 1653. He became minister of Farmington, Connecticut, where his descendants lived for many generations. Of Rev. Samuel Hooker, Cotton Mather wrote in &quot;Magnalia Christi Americana&quot;: &quot;Thus we have to this day among us our dead Hooker, yet living in his worthy son Samuel Hooker, an able, faithful, useful minister at Farmington, in the Colony of Connecticut.&quot;

His daughter Mary married Rev. Roger Newton, who was a founder and first minister of Farmington, Connecticut. Newton later was called as minister in Milford, Connecticut.

His grandchildren also had prominent lives. John Hooker, son of Rev. Samuel and grandson of Rev. Thomas, served as Speaker of the Connecticut Assembly, and previously as Judge of the state supreme court. James Hooker, brother of John and son of Rev. Samuel, also became a prominent political figure in Connecticut. He married the daughter of William Leete of Guilford, Connecticut, and subsequently settled there. James Hooker served as the first probate judge, and later as speaker of the Connecticut colonial assembly. Rev. Thomas&#x27;s granddaughter Mary Hooker, the daughter of Rev. Samuel, married the Rev. James Pierpont. Their daughter Sarah Pierpont married the Rev. Jonathan Edwards.

Other descendants of Thomas Hooker include Henry Hooker, John Hooker, Arthur Atterbury, Charles Atterbury Mary Hooker Pierpont, William Howard Taft, Timothy Dwight V, Aaron Burr, William Gillette, William Huntington Russell, Edward H. Gillette, George Catlin, Emma Willard, J.P. Morgan, Rev. Joshua Leavitt, Roger Hooker Leavitt, Hart Leavitt, Frank Nelson Doubleday, John Turner Sargent, Thom Miller, Adonijah Rockwell and Nathan Watson. On May 16, 1890, descendants of Thomas Hooker held their first reunion at Hartford, Connecticut.

<text>Russia has a high-income&lt;ref name=&quot;https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; mixed economy with state ownership in strategic areas of the economy. Market reforms in the 1990s privatized much of Russian industry and agriculture, with notable exceptions to this privatization occurring in the energy and defense-related sectors.

Russia&#x27;s vast geography is an important determinant of its economic activity, with some sources estimating that Russia contains over 30 percent of the world&#x27;s natural resources. The World Bank estimates the total value of Russia&#x27;s natural resources at US$75 trillion. Russia relies on energy revenues to drive most of its growth. Russia has an abundance of petroleum, natural gas and precious metals, which make up a major share of Russia&#x27;s exports. the oil-and-gas sector accounted for 16% of the GDP, 52% of federal budget revenues and over 70% of total exports.

<doc id="268438" wikidata="Q901723" url="?curid=268438" title="Excimer">
<text>An excimer (originally short for excited dimer) is a short-lived polyatomic molecule formed from two species that do not form a stable molecule in the ground state. In this case, formation of molecules is possible only if such atom is in an electronic excited state. Heteronuclear molecules and molecules that have more than two species are also called exciplex molecules (originally short for excited complex). Excimers are often diatomic and are composed of two atoms or molecules that would not bond if both were in the ground state. The lifetime of an excimer is very short, on the order of nanoseconds.

==Formation and decay==

Under the molecular orbital formalism, a typical ground-state molecule has electrons in the lowest possible energy levels. According to the Pauli principle, at most two electrons can occupy a given orbital, and if an orbital contains two electrons they must be in opposite spin states. The highest occupied molecular orbital is called the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital is called the LUMO; the energy gap between these two states is known as the HOMO–LUMO gap. If the molecule absorbs light whose energy is equal to this gap, an electron in the HOMO may be excited to the LUMO. This is called the molecule&#x27;s excited state.

Excimers are only formed when one of the dimer components is in the excited state. When the excimer returns to the ground state, its components dissociate and often repel each other. The wavelength of an excimer&#x27;s emission is longer (smaller energy) than that of the excited monomer&#x27;s emission. An excimer can thus be measured by fluorescent emissions.

Because excimer formation is dependent on a bimolecular interaction, it is promoted by high monomer density. Low-density conditions produce excited monomers that decay to the ground state before they interact with an unexcited monomer to form an excimer.

==Usage note==
The term &quot;excimer&quot; (excited state dimer) is, strictly speaking, limited to cases in which a true dimer is formed; that is, both components of the dimer are the same molecule or atom. The term exciplex refers to the heterodimeric case; however, common usage expands &quot;excimer&quot; to cover this situation.

==Examples and use==

Heterodimeric diatomic complexes involving a noble gas and a halide, such as xenon chloride, are common in the construction of excimer lasers, which are excimers&#x27; most common application. These lasers take advantage of the fact that excimer components have attractive interactions in the excited state and repulsive interactions in the ground state. Emission of excimer molecules is also used as a source of spontaneous ultraviolet light (excimer lamps).

The molecule pyrene is another canonical example of an excimer that has found applications in biophysics to evaluate the distance between biomolecules.

In organic chemistry, many reactions occur through an exciplex, for example, those of simple arene compounds with alkenes. The reactions of benzene and their products depicted are a [2+2]cycloaddition to the ortho product (A), a [2+3]cycloaddition to the meta product (B) and the [2+4]cycloaddition to the para product (C) with simple alkenes such as the isomers of 2-butene. In these reactions, it is the arene that is excited.

As a general rule, the regioselectivity is in favor of the ortho adduct at the expense of the meta adduct when the amount of charge transfer taking place in the exciplex increases.

== Generation techniques ==
For a noble gas dimer or noble gas halide it takes a noble gas atom in an excited electronic state to form an excimer molecule. Sufficiently high energy (approximately 10 eV) is required to obtain a noble gas atom in the lowest excited electronic state, which provides the formation of an excimer molecule. The most convenient way to excite gases is by an electric discharge. That is why such excimer molecules are generated in a plasma (see excimer molecule formation) or through high energy electron beams.

==Fluorescence quenching==
Exciplexes provide one of the three dynamic mechanisms by which fluorescence is quenched. A regular exciplex has some charge-transfer (CT) character, and in the extreme case there are distinct radical ions with unpaired electrons. If the unpaired electrons can spin-pair to form a covalent bond, then the covalent bonding interaction can lower the energy of the charge transfer state. Strong CT stabilisation has been shown to lead to a conical intersection of this exciplex state with the ground state in a balance of steric effects, electrostatic interactions, stacking interactions, and relative conformations that can determine the formation and accessibility of bonded exciplexes.

As an exception to the conventional radical ion pair model, this mode of covalent bond formation is of interest to photochemistry research, as well as the many biological fields using fluorescence spectroscopy techniques. Evidence for the bonded exciplex intermediate has been given in studies of steric and Coulombic effects on the quenching rate constants and from extensive density functional theory computations that show a curve crossing between the ground state and the low-energy bonded exciplex state.

<doc id="268440" wikidata="Q1030008" url="?curid=268440" title="Tamar (Genesis)">
<text>In the Book of Genesis, Tamar (; ) was the daughter-in-law of Judah (twice), as well as the mother of two of his children: the twins Perez and Zerah.

==Genesis narrative==
In , Tamar is first described as marrying Judah&#x27;s eldest son, Er. Because of his unidentified wickedness, Er was killed by God. By way of a levirate union, Judah asked his second son, Onan, to provide offspring for Tamar so that the family line might continue. This could have substantial economic repercussions, with any son born deemed the heir of the deceased Er, and able to claim the firstborn&#x27;s double share of inheritance. However, if Er was childless, Onan would inherit as the oldest surviving son.

Onan performed &quot;coitus interruptus&quot;. His action displeased God and so, like his older brother, God killed him. At this point, Judah is portrayed as viewing Tamar to be cursed and therefore as being reluctant to give her his remaining and youngest son Shelah. Rather, he tells Tamar to wait for Shelah. However, even after Shelah has grown up, Judah still does not give Tamar to him in marriage.

=== Judah and Tamar ===
After Shelah had grown up, Judah became a widower. After Judah mourned the death of his wife, he planned on going to Timnath to shear his sheep. Upon hearing this news, Tamar disguised herself as a prostitute and immediately went to Timnath which was en route to Judah&#x27;s destination. Upon arriving at a place near Timnath, where two roads met, Judah saw the woman but did not recognize her as Tamar because of the veil she wore over her face. Thinking she was a prostitute, he requested her services. Tamar&#x27;s plan was to become pregnant by this ruse so that she might bear a child in Judah&#x27;s line, since Judah had not given her to his son Shelah. So she played the part of a prostitute and struck a bargain with Judah for a goat, secured by his staff, seal, and cord. When Judah was able to have a goat sent to Timnath, in order to collect his staff, seal, and cord, the woman was nowhere to be found and no one knew of any prostitute in Timnath.

Three months later, Tamar was reported to Judah by family members to be pregnant. Upon hearing this news, Judah ordered that she be burned to death. Tamar sent the staff, seal, and cord to Judah with a message declaring that the owner of these items was the man who had made her pregnant. Upon recognizing these items as his security, Judah released Tamar from her sentence. Tamar gave birth to twins, Perez and Zerah. Their birth is reminiscent of the birth of Rebekah&#x27;s twin sons. The midwife marks Zerah&#x27;s hand with a scarlet cord when he emerges first from the womb, though Perez is born first. Perez is identified in the Book of Ruth as the ancestor of King David. The Genesis narrative also makes a note that Judah praised Tamar&#x27;s righteousness and did not have further sexual relations with her. 

According to Ethiopic tradition, Perez became the king of Persia.

==Narrative criticism==
Literary critics have focused on the relationship between the Judah story in chapter 38 and the Joseph story in chapters 37 and 39. Victor P. Hamilton notes some &quot;intentional literary parallels&quot; between the chapters, such as the exhortation to &quot;identify&quot; (38:25–26 and 37:32–33). John Emerton regards the connections as evidence for including chapter 38 in the J corpus, and suggests that the J writer dovetailed the Joseph and Judah traditions. Derek Kidner points out that the insertion of chapter 38 &quot;creates suspense for the reader&quot;, but Robert Alter goes further and suggests it is a result of the &quot;brilliant splicing of sources by a literary artist.&quot; He notes that the same verb &quot;identify” will play &quot;a crucial thematic role in the dénouement of the Joseph story when he confronts his brothers in Egypt, he recognizing them, they failing to recognize him.&quot;

J. A. Emerton also suggests that the &quot;Judah and Tamar narrative&quot; contains &quot;aetiological motifs concerned with the eponymous ancestors of the clans of Judah.&#x27; Emerton notes that Dillman and Noth considered the account of the deaths of Er and Onan to &quot;reflect the dying out of two clans of Judah bearing their names, or at least of their failure to maintain a separate existence.&quot; However, this view was &quot;trenchantly criticized&quot; by Thomas L. Thompson.

Along with the account of Lot and his daughters Tamar and Judah is one of two instances of sperm stealing in the Bible, in which a woman seduces a male relative under false pretenses in order to become pregnant. Each case involves a direct ancestor of King David.

===Jewish views===

According to the Talmud, Judah&#x27;s confession of guilt itself atoned for some of his prior faults, and resulted in his being divinely rewarded by a share in the future world. The Talmud also suggests that Tamar&#x27;s actions were for the purpose of avoiding Judah&#x27;s humiliation, although the Genesis Rabbah portrays her as boastful and unashamed in regard to the pregnancy itself.

Both the Genesis Rabbah and Talmud state that Tamar was an Israelite, and that Judah ended up marrying her and had further sexual liaisons with her as a result.

However, some argue that Tamar was Canaanite, since her father&#x27;s residence was not implied to be outside of Canaan. She is also theorized to be the daughter of Melchizedek. One reason includes Judah prescribing a penalty similar to the one in against Tamar. In addition, Melchizedek was the only Canaanite priest who worshiped the &quot;one true God&quot;.

Frymer-Kensky finds Tamar&#x27;s traits of assertiveness in action, willingness to be unconventional, and deep loyalty to family to be qualities that distinguish her descendant, King David.

According to &quot;Legends of the Jews&quot;, Tamar was endowed with a prophetic gift which allowed her to know the future of her descendants. From this gift, she knew that she would be the ancestress of royal line of David and mighty prophets. While she was standing in gate of Timnah and wearing a veil; Judah, who was intoxicated from wine that twisted his understanding away, came to her. After that, he left her with three symbolical pledges; his staff, the stay of Tribe of Judah; his mantle, representation of his strength; and his signet-diadem, the glory of kingdom of Judah. When her state became known, Tamar was dragged before the court, in which Isaac, Jacob, and Judah as the judges. 

As a judge, Judah gave a decision that Tamar was liable to the death penalty by burning according to the law, for she was the daughter of the high priest (Shem) who was accused of leading an unchaste demeanor. After Tamar showed the three pledges from the man who came to her, Judah&#x27;s countenance grew pale to green color when he publicly confessed his relationship with her.

===Christian views===
According to the Gospel of Matthew, Judah and Tamar are ancestors of Jesus through their son Perez.

==Chronological issues==

Together with the brief preceding narrative of the birth of Er, Onan, and Shelah, and the subsequent narrative of the birth of Perez&#x27;s children, the passage is often regarded as presenting a significant chronological issue, since it is surrounded by a narrative concerning Joseph; before the passage occurs, Joseph is described as being 17 years old, and after the passage, Joseph is described as meeting up with Judah 9 years after Joseph reached 30 years of age.

The gap, a maximum of 22 years, is somewhat small to contain within it Judah&#x27;s first marriage, the birth of Er and Onan, Er&#x27;s marriage to Tamar, Tamar&#x27;s subsequent pregnancy by Judah, and the birth of Judah&#x27;s children (Judah was the father and his daughter-in-law, Tamar, was the mother); the passage is also widely regarded as an abrupt change to the surrounding narrative Joseph story. According to some textual scholars, the reason for these features is that the passage derives from the Jahwist source, while the immediately surrounding narrative is from the Elohist, the two being spliced together at a later date.

The Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary proposes that Judah was about 20 years old when he settled in Adullam and that his sons, Er and Onan, were 17 years old when they married. The sons of Hezron and Hamul were considered to be part of Jacob&#x27;s family that moved to Egypt since they were born there.

<doc id="268451" wikidata="Q432637" url="?curid=268451" title="George Washington University">
<text>The George Washington University (GW or GWU) is a private federally-chartered research university in Washington, D.C., United States. Originally named Columbian College, it was chartered in 1821 by the United States Congress and is the first university founded under Washington, D.C.&#x27;s jurisdiction. It is one of the nation&#x27;s six federally chartered universities.

GW is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity.&quot; It is a member of the Association of American Universities. The university offers degree programs in seventy-one disciplines, enrolling around 11,500 undergraduate and 15,000 graduate students. The school&#x27;s athletic teams, the George Washington Revolutionaries, play in the NCAA Division I Atlantic 10 Conference. GW also annually hosts numerous political events, including the World Bank and International Monetary Fund&#x27;s Annual Meetings.

Several notable individuals have served as trustees, including two presidents, John Quincy Adams and Ulysses S. Grant, and Alexander Graham Bell. Notable alumni, faculty, and affiliates include 16 foreign heads of state or government, 28 United States senators, 27 United States governors, 18 U.S. Cabinet members, five Nobel laureates, two Olympic medalists, two Academy Award winners, and a Golden Globe winner. GW has over 1,100 active alumni in the U.S. Foreign Service and is one of the largest feeder schools for the diplomatic corps. In the 2023-2024 academic year, GW had $227 million in externally funded research. 

==History==
===Founding===
The first President of the United States, George Washington, long favored the establishment of a university in a central part of the United States. He advocated for its establishment to the U.S. Congress and others throughout his political career. Washington envisioned the new university would be in a central part of the new national capital, and he hoped the university would educate the most promising students from across the country while reaping the benefits of its location in Washington, D.C. 

On December 14, 1799, George Washington passed away at his home in Mount Vernon. Washington included a bequest of his shares in the Potomac Company to establish the university in his last will and testament, though the shares lost their value and no educational institution ever benefited from them. Following his death, his desire was shared and encouraged by U.S. presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who both expressed the need to carry out Washington&#x27;s plans. 

In 1821, the Baptist missionary and leading minister Luther Rice secured funds from James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, John C. Calhoun, and other benefactors for a college to educate citizens from throughout the young nation in Washington, D.C. A large building was constructed on College Hill, which is now known as Meridian Hill. On February 9, 1821, President Monroe approved the congressional charter, creating the non-denominational Columbian College. Washingtonians, Congress, and the academic community celebrated this new institution as the fulfillment of Washington&#x27;s vision. In 1824, the first commencement was considered an important event for the young city. In attendance were President Monroe, John C. Calhoun, Henry Clay, the Marquis de Lafayette, and other dignitaries.

Like much of Washington, D.C., George Washington University traces its origins back to the Freemasons. The Bible that the President of the George Washington University uses to swear an oath on upon inauguration is the Bible of Freemason George Washington. Freemasonry symbols are prominently displayed throughout the campus, including the foundation stones of many of the university buildings.

=== 19th century ===
During the 19th century, most of the university&#x27;s students came from the South. As the American Civil War commenced in 1861, many left their studies to join the Confederate States Army. However, the college was still fractured. Professor of anatomy A. Y. P. Garnett left the university to serve as Jefferson Davis&#x27; physician, and Robert King Stone stayed in Washington, D.C., serving as physician to Abraham Lincoln. The college was temporarily turned into a Union Army military camp during the Civil War. Poet Walt Whitman worked at this camp while visiting his wounded brother. 

In 1873, following the Civil War, Columbian College was renamed Columbian University and moved to an urban downtown location centered on 15th and H streets.

===20th century===

In 1904, Columbian University was renamed George Washington University following an agreement with the George Washington Memorial Association. In honor of George Washington, funds from the memorial association were donated to construct Lisner Auditorium. 

In 1912, the university moved its principal operations to the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Many of the colleges of the George Washington University are notable for their age and history. The law school is the oldest law school in the District of Columbia. The medical school is the 11th-oldest medical school in the nation and the first established in the nation&#x27;s capital. The Columbian College was founded in 1821 and is the oldest unit of the university. The Elliott School of International Affairs was formalized in 1898.

In the 1930s, the university was a major center for theoretical physics. George Gamow, a cosmologist, produced the Big Bang theory at the university in the 1930s and 1940s. On January 26, 1939, Niels Bohr announced that Otto Hahn had successfully split the atom at the Fifth Washington Conference on theoretical physics in the Hall of Government.

During the Vietnam War era, Thurston Hall, an undergraduate dormitory housing 1,116 students at 1900 F Street NW, located three blocks from the White House, was a staging ground for student anti-war demonstrations.

In 1996, the university purchased the Mount Vernon College for Women in the city&#x27;s Palisades neighborhood that became the school&#x27;s coeducational Mount Vernon Campus. The campus was first utilized in 1997 for women only but became co-educational in a matter of years. The Mount Vernon campus is now totally integrated into the GW community, serving as a complement to the Foggy Bottom campus. In 1999, GW hosted the Town Hall with President Clinton, the first presidential town hall to ever be webcast live.
=== 21st century ===
In December 2006, the university appointed Johns Hopkins University provost Steven Knapp as the 16th President of the George Washington University, and his presidency began August 1, 2007. In 2017, Thomas LeBlanc, provost of the University of Miami, was named the President of the George Washington University.

In July 2020, the university began forming special committees to look at possible name changes to an on-campus building and the school moniker. In a statement on the university&#x27;s website, LeBlanc said one of the panels would examine the Colonials moniker, which critics said conjured up racism, violence, and genocide. In 2022, the Colonials name was officially retired. The following year, in 2023, the new nickname, the George Washington Revolutionaries, was announced. Another panel looked into renaming the Marvin Center, which was named after former school President Cloyd Heck Marvin, a segregationist. 

In January 2022, LeBlanc was succeeded by former Washington University in St. Louis Chancellor Mark S. Wrighton as interim university president. A year later, in January 2023, the university named Ellen Granberg, provost at Rochester Institute of Technology, as the university&#x27;s new president, with a start date of July 1, 2023. George Washington University joined the Association of American Universities in 2023.

==Campuses==


GW has three fully integrated campuses in the Washington, D.C. area: the Foggy Bottom campus, the Mount Vernon campus, and the Virginia Science and Technology campus. The Foggy Bottom Campus houses the vast majority of academic programming. Residence halls exist on the Foggy Bottom and Mount Vernon campuses.

The GW library system contains the Gelman Library, the Himmelfarb Health Sciences Library, the Burns Law Library, Eckles Library (named for Charles Ellison Eckles and Anita Heurich Eckles), and the Virginia Science and Technology Library. The GW Library System is a constituent member of the Washington Research Library Consortium, which allows for resource sharing among the university libraries of the Washington metropolitan area.

===Foggy Bottom===
 
 
 

The main GW campus consists of in historic Foggy Bottom and is located a few blocks from the White House, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, State Department and the National Mall. Barring a few outlying buildings, the boundaries of campus are delineated by (running clockwise from Washington Circle) Pennsylvania Avenue, 19th Street, E Street, Virginia Avenue, 24th Street, and New Hampshire Avenue. The university owns much of the property in Foggy Bottom and leases it to various tenants, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Other institutions in proximity include the U.S. State Department, the Kennedy Center, the U.S. Institute of Peace, the Watergate complex, and embassies of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Spain, and Uruguay. The University Yard is the main open space and historic heart of the university. Along with George Washington&#x27;s main library, Gelman Library, it constitutes the hub of the main campus. The seven-story Gelman Library building contains over two million volumes and is constructed in the Brutalist architectural style of the 1970s. It features a concrete façade punctuated by windows that are divided by projecting vertical slabs. For most of the year, parts of the library are open 24 hours a day, seven days per week for use by students, faculty, and staff. The library&#x27;s seventh floor includes the Special Collections Research Center, National Security Archives, Global Resources Center, and Kiev Library.

The National Security Archives (NSA) is a research institution that publishes declassified U.S. government files concerning selected topics of American foreign policy. It was a National Security Archive Freedom of Information Act request that eventually made the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s so-called &quot;Family Jewels&quot; public.

Close to the library is Lisner Auditorium and a large open area between them is known as Kogan Plaza. Southeast of the plaza and located near Monroe Hall and Hall of Government is the Monroe Court, a landscaped area with a large fountain. The Foggy Bottom–GWU Washington Metro station is located at the intersection of 23rd and I Streets NW due south of Washington Circle, and provides access to the Orange, Blue and Silver lines. The University Hospital is located next to the Metro station entrance.

The Foggy Bottom campus contains most of the residence halls in which GW students live. The most notable include Shenkman Hall, Thurston Hall, Madison Hall, Potomac House, Fulbright Hall, Mitchell Hall, Munson Hall, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis Hall, Phillip Amsterdam Hall, Guthridge Hall, Madison Hall, Townhouse Row, South Hall, and the newest, District House, which opened in 2016.

In late 2007, construction began on a large mixed-use residential, office and retail development located on the site of the old GW Hospital (Square 54) and just east of the Foggy Bottom–GW Metrorail station. It was the second-largest undeveloped lot in the District of Columbia at the time of initial construction activity. In 2014, the university assumed ownership of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the oldest private art museum in Washington, D.C. and independent college of art and design. The college of art and design became The Corcoran School of the Arts and Design under the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences. The National Gallery of Art will acquire many of the 17,000 pieces of art from the Corcoran and the rest will be donated to other museums around the country. In May 2014, GW opened the Milken Institute School of Public Health, a nine-story building that received LEED certification for sustainability features including a green roof, rainwater collection system, and special heating and air conditioning technologies that helps mass air displacement. The Textile Museum reopened to the public in March 2015 after the institution merged with the university in 2011 and closed it for renovations two years later.

It was purchased so that the university could gain more space and valuable land for athletics, such as for the women&#x27;s soccer team. Now known as the Mount Vernon campus, it is totally integrated into the GW community, serving as a complement to the Foggy Bottom campus. The campus has transportation systems connecting the students to the GW campus in Foggy Bottom. It also includes Eckles Library, six residence halls, Lloyd Gymnasium, The GW-Mount Vernon Athletic Complex and other various campus facilities.

===Virginia===
The George Washington University also operates a research and graduate campus in Ashburn, Virginia (near Dulles International Airport) which was established in 1991. Starting with a donation of from Robert H. Smith, the campus grew to by 2010. Besides graduate education, this campus also offers undergraduate education to students, including Health Science, Cybersecurity &amp; Information Technology, and Nursing.

Additionally, the university also operates several other graduate satellite education centers. These include the Alexandria Graduate Education Center in Alexandria, the Graduate Education Center in Arlington, and the Hampton Roads Center in Newport News. The Virginia Science and Technology Campus hosts research and educational partnerships with industry and government officials and offers more than 20 graduate degrees.

The Virginia Science and Technology Campus is home to the first walkable solar-power sidewalk in the world. The project began in 2012 and was completed two years later, inaugurated in October 2014.

<text>Stearin , or tristearin, or glyceryl tristearate is an odourless, white powder. It is a triglyceride derived from three units of stearic acid. Most triglycerides are derived from at least two and more commonly three different fatty acids. Like other triglycerides, stearin can crystallise in three polymorphs. For stearin, these melt at 54 (α-form), 65, and (β-form).

Note that stearin is also used to mean the solid component of an oil or fat that can be separated into components that melt at higher (the stearin) and lower (the olein) temperatures. This is the usage meant in an example such as palm stearin.

== Occurrence ==
Stearin is obtained from animal fats created as a byproduct of processing beef. It can also be found in tropical plants such as palm. It can be partially purified by dry fractionation by pressing tallow or other fatty mixtures, leading to separation of the higher melting stearin-rich material from the liquid, which is typically enriched in fats derived from oleic acid. It can be obtained by interesterification, again exploiting its higher melting point which allows the higher melting tristearin to be removed from the equilibrated mixture. Stearin is a side product obtained during the extraction of cod liver oil removed during the chilling process at temperatures below .

== Uses ==
Stearin is used as a hardening agent in the manufacture of candles and soap. It is mixed with a sodium hydroxide solution in water, creating a reaction which gives glycerin and sodium stearate, the main ingredient in most soap:

:C3H5(C18H35O2)3 + 3 NaOH → C3H5(OH)3 + 3 C18H35OONa

Stearin is also added to aluminium flakes to help in the grinding process in making dark aluminium powder.

<doc id="268461" wikidata="Q1375894" url="?curid=268461" title="Operation Nachshon">
<text>Operation Nachshon (, &quot;Mivtza Nahshon&quot;; 5–16 April 1948) was a military operation of the Haganah during the 1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine and part of Plan Dalet. Its objective was to open the Tel Aviv – Jerusalem road blockaded by Palestinian Arabs, and furnish arms and supplies to the besieged Jewish community of Jerusalem. The operation was also known as &quot;The operation to take control of the Jerusalem road,&quot; following which participating units later broke off to form the Harel Brigade. Following attempts to take control of the road to Jerusalem were unsuccessful and led to the construction of a makeshift bypass—Burma Road.

Nachshon was the first major Haganah operation and the first step of Plan Dalet. The Deir Yassin massacre was conducted as a part of the operation. Operation Nachshon was carried out by the Haganah&#x27;s Givati and what was later to be known as the Harel Brigade of the Palmach.

==Background==

By the end of March 1948, Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni&#x27;s troops were preventing supply convoys from reaching Jerusalem. The city was besieged and the Jewish population was forced to adhere to a rationing system. On 31 March a 60 vehicle Jewish convoy was ambushed at Khulda and forced to turn back with the loss of five vehicles and 17 dead. Yishuv leader David Ben-Gurion decided to launch Nachshon in order to open up the city and provide supplies to the Jewish residents. Although initially intended as a one-shot affair, Nachshon later proved to be the first operation in the implementation of Plan Dalet.
According to historian Ilan Pappé, &quot;Operation Nachshon [...] was the first operation in which all the various Jewish military organisations endeavoured to act together as a single army – providing the basis for the future Israeli Defence Forces (IDF).&quot;

==The operation==

The operation was named after the Biblical figure Nachshon Ben Aminadav, who was the first to wade into the Red Sea when the Hebrews escaped from slavery in Egypt. The operation was commanded by Shimon Avidan.

The first orders were given on 2 April 1948. A telegraph confirming the beginning of the operation was released on 5 April, with the operation starting that same night. It lasted until 20 April. 1,500 men from the Givati and Harel brigades took control of the road to Jerusalem, allowing three of four convoys to get to the city.

The operation was a military success. All the Arab villages that blocked the route were either taken or destroyed, and the Jewish forces were victorious in all their engagements. Nonetheless, not all the objectives of the operation were achieved, as only 1,800 tonnes of the 3,000 envisaged were transported to the town, and two months of severe rationing had to be assumed.

Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni was killed during the night of 7–8 April, in the middle of the battles taking place in Al-Qastal. The loss of the charismatic Palestinian leader &#x27;disrupted the Arab strategy and organisation in the area of Jerusalem.&#x27; His successor, Emil Ghuri, changed tactics: instead of provoking a series of ambushes throughout the route, he had a huge road block erected at Bab-el-Oued, and Jerusalem was once again isolated as a consequence.

During Operation Nachshon the Haganah wanted to attack the strategic village of Abu Gosh but this was opposed by the Stern Gang whose local commanders were on good terms with the mukhtar.

==Aftermath==
Operation Nachshon exposed the poor military organisation of the Palestinian paramilitary groups. Due to lack of logistics, particularly food and ammunition, they were incapable of maintaining engagements that were more than a few hours away from their permanent bases.

Faced with these events, the Arab Higher Committee asked Alan Cunningham to allow the return of the Mufti, the only person capable of redressing the situation. Despite obtaining permission, the Mufti did not get to Jerusalem. His declining prestige cleared the way for the expansion of the influence of the Arab Liberation Army and of Fawzi al-Qawuqji in the Jerusalem area.

Between 15 and 20 April, three convoys, totalling over 700 lorries were able to reach Jewish Jerusalem. The Arabs, however, managed to block the road immediately thereafter. Operation Nachshon was therefore followed by Operation Harel, and immediately thereafter Operation Yevusi. Further operations in the Jerusalem region, Operation Maccabi and Operation Kilshon, took place in May.

<text>The Vehicle Assembly Building (originally the Vertical Assembly Building), or VAB, is a large building at NASA&#x27;s Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida, designed to assemble large pre-manufactured space vehicle components, such as the massive Saturn V, the Space Shuttle and the Space Launch System, and stack them vertically onto one of three mobile launcher platforms used by NASA. As of March 2022, the first Space Launch System (SLS) rocket was assembled inside in preparation for the Artemis I mission, launched on November 16, 2022.

At , it is the eighth-largest building in the world by volume as of 2022. The building is at Launch Complex 39 at KSC, south of Jacksonville, north of Miami, and due east of Orlando, on Merritt Island on the Atlantic coast of Florida.

The VAB is the largest single-story building in the world, was the tallest building () in Florida until 1974, and is the tallest building in the United States outside an urban area.

== History ==
The VAB, completed in 1966, was originally built for the vertical assembly of the Apollo–Saturn V space vehicle and was originally referred to as the &quot;Vertical Assembly Building&quot;. In anticipation of post-Apollo projects such as the Space Shuttle program, it was renamed the Vehicle Assembly Building on February 3, 1965. It was subsequently used to mate the Space Shuttle orbiters to their external fuel tanks and solid rocket boosters. Once the complete space vehicle was assembled on a mobile launcher platform, a crawler-transporter moved it to Launch Complex-39A or 39B.

The building was designed with future expansion in mind but ultimately ended up being larger than NASA would ever need. Initially, during the planning of Kennedy Space Center, as many as five launch pads were proposed, and designs for a six-bay VAB were drawn up. However, as the plans were scaled back to just two launch pads, the VAB was reduced to four bays. The contractors built the VAB to accommodate potential expansion to six bays, but such expansion was never required. In fact, only three bays were ever connected to the crawlerway. Bay 2, located on the west side of the building (farther from the launch pads), saw limited use during the Saturn V era and was eventually converted into a storage area for the Shuttle program.

Before the destruction of in 2003, NASA installed a sub-roof inside the VAB to deal with falling concrete debris due to the building&#x27;s age.

The VAB was designated as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2020.

== Construction ==

In 1963, NASA contracted Urbahn Architects to design and build the VAB. Construction began with driving the first steel foundation piles on Aug. 2, 1963. It was part of NASA&#x27;s massive effort to send astronauts to the Moon for the Apollo program. Altogether, 4,225 pilings were driven down 164 feet to bedrock with a foundation consisting of of concrete. Construction of the VAB required of steel. The building was completed in 1966. The VAB is tall, long and wide. It covers , and encloses of space. Located on Florida&#x27;s Atlantic coast, the building was constructed to withstand hurricanes and tropical storms. Despite this, it has received damage from several hurricanes (see below).

== Capabilities ==

The north end of the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) contains four “high bays” designed as enclosed, protected spaces for stacking rocket stages, payloads, and other components vertically on a mobile launcher platform. This configuration mirrors how the rocket will stand on the launch pad. Components and stages typically enter the VAB through the south side, which houses eight &quot;low bays&quot; used for storage and pre-assembly preparations. Platforms in both the high and low bays can be adjusted to provide crews safe access to all parts of the rocket. A transfer aisle runs the length of the building.

The VAB is equipped with five overhead cranes, including two capable of lifting up to 325 tons, as well as 136 additional lifting devices. These systems enable precise handling and assembly of heavy components. Once the launch vehicle is fully assembled and tested, a crawler-transporter enters the VAB, lifts the mobile launch platform with the attached spacecraft, and transports it to the a launch pad.

Each high bay features a massive door—the largest in the world—standing tall. Each door comprises seven vertical panels and four horizontal panels and takes about 45 minutes to open or close.

To manage internal conditions, the VAB is equipped with air conditioning, including 125 ventilators on the roof and four large air handlers located west of the building. The system provides a combined 10,000 tons of refrigeration (120,000,000 BTU/hr, 35 MW), not to cool the building, but to control moisture. The air inside the building can be completely replaced every hour. When the building&#x27;s large doors are opened, fog can enter and linger, leading to incorrect but persistent rumors that the VAB generates its own weather or forms clouds.

== Exterior ==

The American flag painted on the building was the largest in the world when added in 1976 as part of United States Bicentennial celebrations, along with the star logo of the anniversary, later replaced by the NASA insignia in 1998. It is high and wide. Each of the stars on the flag is across, the blue field is the size of a regulation basketball court, and each of the stripes is wide.
Work began in early 2007 to restore the exterior paint on the immense facility. Special attention was paid to the enormous American flag and NASA &quot;meatball&quot; insignia. The work repaired visible damage from years of storms and weathering. The flag and logo had been previously repainted in 1998 for NASA&#x27;s 40th anniversary.
The most extensive exterior damage occurred during the storm season of 2004, when Hurricane Frances blew off 850 aluminum panels from the building, resulting in about of new openings in the sides. Twenty-five additional panels were blown off the east side by the winds from Hurricane Jeanne just three weeks later. Earlier in the season, Hurricane Charley caused significant but less serious damage, estimated to cost $700,000 to repair. Damage caused by these hurricanes was still visible in 2007. Some of these panels are &quot;punch-outs&quot;, designed to detach from the VAB when a large pressure differential is created on the outside vs. the inside. This allows for equalization, and helps protect the structural integrity of the building during rapid changes in pressure such as in tropical cyclones.

The building has been used as a backdrop in several Hollywood movies including &quot;Marooned&quot;, &quot;SpaceCamp&quot;, &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, &quot;Contact&quot;, and others.

== Future ==
Originally, after the Space Shuttle was intended to be retired in 2010, the VAB would have been renovated for stacking of the Ares I and Ares V launch vehicles for the Constellation program, however the Constellation program was cancelled in 2010. The Space Shuttle itself was retired in 2011 after which NASA temporarily (as early as 2012) offered public tours of the VAB. These tours were temporarily discontinued in February 2014 to allow for renovations to take place.

The NASA FY2013 budget included US$143.7 million for Construction of Facilities (CoF) requirements in support of what is now known as the Artemis program and its vehicles, including the Space Launch System (SLS) and Orion spacecraft. NASA began modifying Launch Complex 39 at KSC to support the new SLS in 2014, beginning with major repairs, code upgrades and safety improvements to the Launch Control Center, Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) and the VAB Utility Annex. This initial work is required to support any launch vehicle operated from Launch Complex 39 and will allow NASA to begin modernizing the facilities, while vehicle-specific requirements are being developed.

The VAB could be used to some extent for assembly and processing of any future vehicles using Launch Complex 39, in addition to renovations for SLS capabilities. On June 16, 2015, NASA released an announcement for proposals (AFP) seeking interest in using the VAB High Bay 2 and other complex facilities for commercial use in &quot;assembling, integration, and testing of launch vehicles&quot;. This move is in line with the intent to migrate KSC towards acting as a spaceport accessible to both government and commercial ventures.

On April 21, 2016, NASA announced the selection of Orbital ATK (bought by Northrop Grumman as of 2019) to begin negotiations for High Bay 2. The &quot;potential agreement&quot; included an existing mobile launcher platform. NASA subsequently completed the agreement in August 2019 to lease High Bay 2 and Mobile Launcher Platform 3 to Northrop Grumman for use with their OmegA launch vehicle. However, development of OmegA was subsequently cancelled in September 2020. Northrop Grumman had yet to make any modifications to High Bay 2, and were using it for the storage of OmegA hardware. This hardware was scheduled to be removed from the VAB and returned to Northrop Grumman by the end of September 2020.

<text>Stapleton International Airport was a major airport in the western United States, and the primary airport of Denver, Colorado. It opened on October 17, 1929, and was replaced by the current Denver International Airport in 1995.

It was a hub for Continental Airlines, the original Frontier Airlines, People Express, United Airlines, and Western Airlines. Other airlines with smaller operations at Stapleton included Aspen Airways, today’s Frontier Airlines, and Rocky Mountain Airways, all three being based in Denver at the time.

Stapleton International Airport was replaced by Denver International Airport in 1995; it was closed and the property redeveloped as the commercial and residential neighborhood of Central Park, which was named Stapleton until 2020. The Stapleton International Airport codes were transferred to the new airport, which continues to use them today.

==History==


=== Prewar and wartime years (1929–1945) ===
Stapleton opened in 1929 as Denver Municipal Airport on October 17. The development of the airport was spearheaded by Denver mayor Benjamin F. Stapleton and Improvements and Parks Department manager Charles Vail. Prior to the new airport&#x27;s opening, Denver had been served by a number of smaller facilities, including an airstrip along Smith Road in Aurora (first used in 1911), an airfield at 26th Avenue and Oneida Street, Lowry Field near 38th Avenue and Dahlia Street, and Denver Union Airport at 46th Avenue east of Colorado Boulevard.

In the late 1930s the facilities consisted of two hangars and a small administration building mainly used for air mail processing. United Airlines and Continental Airlines began service in 1937. The March 1939 Official Aviation Guide (OAG) shows nine weekday departures: seven United and two Continental.

Continental moved its headquarters from El Paso, Texas, to Denver in October 1937, as airline president Robert F. Six believed that the airline should have its headquarters in a large city with a potential base of customers. Continental moved its headquarters to Los Angeles in July 1963.

The airfield was renamed Stapleton Airfield on 25 August 1944, in honor of Mayor Stapleton, who had served from 1923-1931 and from 1935 until 1947.

===Postwar years (1945–1978)===
Stapleton&#x27;s modern horseshoe-shaped terminal design was announced in 1946, and was shelved in 1947 by incoming mayor James Newton. The original administration building was extended with new wings in the early 1950s, and replaced entirely in 1954.

DC-4 nonstop flights to Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles began in 1946; DC-6 nonstops to Washington DC began in 1951 and to New York in 1952. Denver then had five airlines: United flew across the country, Continental flew south and east, Braniff flew to Texas, Frontier flew to smaller cities north and south from Denver, and Western connected Denver to Minneapolis and to Edmonton in Canada. TWA and Central arrived in 1956.

The April 1957 OAG shows 38 daily United departures, 12 for Continental, 7 Braniff, 7 Frontier, 7 Western, 5 TWA and 1 Central. The jet age arrived in May 1959 when Continental began operating Boeing 707s to Stapleton, initially under weight restrictions due to Stapleton&#x27;s runway weight capacity. (Scheduled 707s started in August 1959.)

Runway 17/35 and a new terminal building opened in 1964; runway 17L opened sometime between 1975 and 1980. Stapleton adopted the &quot;International&quot; name in 1964, but its first nonstop international flight came in 1968, when Western began flights to Calgary. The Boeing 747 was introduced to Stapleton on Continental&#x27;s Los Angeles route in 1970.

In the early 1970s Frontier was in Concourse A, United occupied most of Concourse B, and Western and Continental occupied most of Concourse C. United and TWA served both coasts nonstop, while Continental and Western nonstop flights only extended to the western half of the country. Concourse D was built in 1972.

===Post-deregulation (1978–1985)===
After deregulation, Denver&#x27;s four major airlines developed hubs at Stapleton. United occupied Concourse B, Continental and Western occupied Concourse C and Frontier occupied Concourse D. Western flew nonstop between Denver and London in 1981 and 1982, but then shifted resources to Salt Lake City and Los Angeles; Denver had ceased to be a Western hub by the time Delta acquired that airline in 1987. In 1983 Arrow Air introduced transatlantic services to London and Manchester, and Condor flew a weekly charter to Frankfurt, Germany. Southwest Airlines and People Express tried low-cost service to Denver in the mid-1980s, but Southwest withdrew and People Express was acquired by Continental.

In September 1982 the first revenue flight of the Boeing 767 arrived at Stapleton, a United flight from O&#x27;Hare International Airport in Chicago.

During the energy boom of the early 1980s, several skyscrapers were built in downtown Denver, including Republic Plaza (Denver&#x27;s tallest at 714′). Due to Stapleton&#x27;s location east of downtown, the Federal Aviation Administration imposed a building height restriction of 700&#x27;-715&#x27; (depending on the building&#x27;s position). This allowed an unimpeded glide slope for runways (8L/26R) and (8R/26L). The height restriction was lifted in 1995, well after the city&#x27;s skyscrapers had been erected.

===Decommissioning (1985–1995)===

By the 1980s, plans were under way to replace Stapleton, which had a number of problems, including:
* inadequate lateral separation between runways, leading to long waits during instrument-flight operations
* little or no room for other airlines that wanted to use Stapleton for new destinations (one such example was Southwest Airlines, now a large carrier at Denver International Airport)
* a lawsuit over aircraft noise, brought by residents of the nearby Park Hill community
* legal threats by Adams County, to block a runway extension into Rocky Mountain Arsenal lands

The Colorado General Assembly brokered a deal in 1985 to annex a plot of land in Adams County into the city of Denver, and use that land to build a new airport. Adams County voters approved the plan in 1988, and Denver voters approved the plan in a 1989 referendum.

To combat congestion, runway 18/36 was added in the 1980s and the terminal was again expanded with the $250-million (or $58-million according to the &quot;New York Times&quot;), 24-gate Concourse E opening in 1988, despite Denver&#x27;s replacement airport already being under construction. By the early 1990s, Concourses A and B were exclusively used by United and United Express; Continental used most of Concourses C and D, and most other airlines moved to Concourse E. In the early 1990s, several charter services to the United Kingdom were introduced, and Martinair inaugurated services to Amsterdam until Stapleton&#x27;s closure. Continental closed its Stapleton pilot and flight attendant bases in October 1994, reducing operations and making United the airport&#x27;s largest carrier. On the other hand, despite leaving Stapleton in the 1980s due to congestion, the new Denver International Airport would eventually become Southwest&#x27;s largest base.

On February 27, 1995, Delta Flight 569 from Dallas Fort Worth International Airport was the last revenue flight to land at Stapleton, scheduled for 7:59 pm. Later that evening, air traffic controller George Hosford cleared the last revenue flight – Continental Flight 34, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 bound for London′s Gatwick Airport scheduled to depart at 8:30 pm but delayed– to take off from Stapleton at 9:27 pm. The aircraft was piloted by Captain Gary &quot;Gomo&quot; Greer, First Officer Scott Nutter and Second Officer Bob Horn. After Flight 34 cleared the runway at 9:39 pm, the airport was shut down, marking the end of 65 years of service. A convoy of ground service equipment and other vehicles (rental cars, baggage carts, fuel trucks, etc.) traveled to the new Denver International Airport (DEN), which opened at 12:01 am on February 28.

===Post-closure redevelopment===
When it closed in 1995, Stapleton had six runways (two sets of three parallel runways) and five terminal concourses. The runways at Stapleton were then marked with large yellow &quot;X&quot;s, which indicated it was no longer legal or safe for aircraft to land there. The IATA and ICAO airport codes of DEN and KDEN were transferred to the new DIA, to coincide with the same changes in airline and ATC computers, to ensure that flights to Denver would land at the new DIA. The main reason the decision was made to close the airport was because the runways were too close together. This would mean air traffic controllers would have to stagger airplane movements. Also, most of the runways were too short, considering the fact that the airport was at 5,333 ft above sea level. Denver International Airport runways are all at or over 12,000 feet in length (runway 16/34L is 16,000 feet).

While Denver International was being built, planners began to consider how the Stapleton site would be redeveloped. A private group of Denver civic leaders, the Stapleton Development Foundation, convened in 1990 and produced a master plan for the site in 1995, emphasizing a pedestrian-oriented design rather than the automobile-oriented designs found in many other planned developments.

Denver sought tenants for Stapleton&#x27;s terminal and concourses, but these buildings proved ill-suited for alternative uses. A July 1997 hailstorm punched several thousand holes in the roofs of the old terminal and concourses, causing water damage, which compelled the city to tear them down. The airport&#x27;s 12-story control tower was retained and served for a time as part of the new Punch Bowl Social, a restaurant and social gathering spot. The office building attached to the tower housed the kitchens and social areas; the tower is closed to public access but is available for private tours.

Most of Stapleton&#x27;s airport infrastructure has been removed, except for the control tower and some hangars, used by Denver Police Academy and by Arise Church Denver among others. The final parking structure was torn down to make room for the &quot;Central Park West&quot; section of the housing development in May 2011. While not part of the former airport, United—Stapleton&#x27;s former largest carrier and current largest airline at Denver International—does operate a training center in the former Stapleton grounds.

==Facilities==
At the time of its decommissioning, the airport covered and had six runways:
* 17R/35L (11,500 ft), concrete
* 17L/35R (12,000 ft), concrete
* 8L/26R (8,599 ft), concrete
* 8R/26L (10,004 ft), concrete
* 7/25 (4,871 ft), concrete 
* 18/36 (7,750 ft), asphalt

The terminal had five concourses:
* Concourse A – Commuter flights, Mesa Air Group, United Airlines
* Concourse B – United Airlines
* Concourse C – Continental Airlines, Mexicana, Martinair, Condor
* Concourse D – Continental Express, Delta Air Lines, MarkAir, Pan Am, Trans World Airlines, Frontier Airlines,
* Concourse E – America West Airlines, American Airlines, Northwest Airlines, Sun Country, USAir

==Accidents and incidents==
Several major incidents occurred at Stapleton:
* On November 1, 1955, United Air Lines Flight 629 was blown up over Longmont shortly after takeoff from Stapleton while en route to Portland. Jack Gilbert Graham planted a bomb on the plane to kill his mother. He purchased travel insurance before the flight took off.
* On July 11, 1961, United Airlines Flight 859, a DC-8-12 (tail number N8040U), veered off the runway on landing. Asymmetric reverse thrust on engines 1 and 2 (left wing) resulted in a loss of directional control, causing the aircraft to collide with construction equipment, killing the driver of one vehicle. In the ensuing fire, 17 of the DC-8&#x27;s 122 occupants died.
* On December 21, 1967, Frontier Airlines (1950-1986) Flight 2610, a Douglas C-47 converted to carry cargo, crashed after takeoff due to the failure of the crew to perform a pre-takeoff control check resulting in takeoff with the elevators immobilized by a control batten. Both occupants were killed.
* On August 7, 1975, Continental Airlines Flight 426, a Boeing 727 bound for Wichita, Kansas, crashed after encountering windshear on takeoff on runway 35L after climbing to . Nobody was killed in the accident.
* On November 16, 1976, a Texas International DC-9-10 stalled after takeoff at Stapleton and crashed. There were 14 injuries among the 81 passengers and 5 crewmembers.

* On November 15, 1987, Continental Airlines Flight 1713, a DC-9-14 bound for Boise, Idaho, crashed on takeoff at Stapleton during a snowstorm. The probable cause of the crash was loss of control due to ice and snow adhering to the aircraft. The aircraft had been deiced, but spent longer than normal on the ground in moderate snowfall before takeoff due to confusion about its location. This accident led to significant changes in aircraft deicing fluids and flight crew procedures for checking for ice contamination prior to takeoff. Twenty-eight of the plane&#x27;s 82 occupants were killed.
* On September 17, 1988, Continental Express Flight 2063, a Beechcraft 1900, made a intentional belly landing after diverting from North Platte Regional Airport when hydraulic issues arose and forced the aircraft to return to Stapleton. A Stapleton spokesman said, &quot;It was a perfect landing, the propellers stopped turning when the aircraft was about four feet above the runway&quot;. There were no injuries and the aircraft was operational again within a week. The landing gear failed due to a manufacturing flaw.

<text>The Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences ( ) published in 1638 was Galileo Galilei&#x27;s final book and a scientific testament covering much of his work in physics over the preceding thirty years. It was written partly in Italian and partly in Latin.

After his &quot;Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems&quot;, the Roman Inquisition had banned the publication of any of Galileo&#x27;s works, including any he might write in the future. After the failure of his initial attempts to publish &quot;Two New Sciences&quot; in France, Germany, and Poland, it was published by Lodewijk Elzevir who was working in Leiden, South Holland, where the writ of the Inquisition was of less consequence (see House of Elzevir). Fra Fulgenzio Micanzio, the official theologian of the Republic of Venice, had initially offered to help Galileo publish the new work there, but he pointed out that publishing the &quot;Two New Sciences&quot; in Venice might cause Galileo unnecessary trouble; thus, the book was eventually published in Holland. Galileo did not seem to suffer any harm from the Inquisition for publishing this book since in January 1639, the book reached Rome&#x27;s bookstores, and all available copies (about fifty) were quickly sold.

&quot;Discourses&quot; was written in a style similar to &quot;Dialogues&quot;, in which three men (Simplicio, Sagredo, and Salviati) discuss and debate the various questions Galileo is seeking to answer. There is a notable change in the men, however; Simplicio, in particular, is no longer quite as simple-minded, stubborn and Aristotelian as his name implies. His arguments are representative of Galileo&#x27;s own early beliefs, as Sagredo represents his middle period, and Salviati proposes Galileo&#x27;s newest models.

== Introduction ==
The book is divided into four days, each addressing different areas of physics. Galileo dedicates &quot;Two New Sciences&quot; to Lord Count of Noailles.

In the First Day, Galileo addressed topics that were discussed in Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Physics&quot; and the Aristotelian school&#x27;s &quot;Mechanics&quot;. It also provides an introduction to the discussion of both of the new sciences. The likeness between the topics discussed, specific questions that are hypothesized, and the style and sources throughout give Galileo the backbone to his First Day. The First Day introduces the speakers in the dialogue: Salviati, Sagredo, and Simplicio, the same as in the &quot;Dialogue&quot;. These three people are all Galileo just at different stages of his life, Simplicio the youngest and Salviati, Galileo&#x27;s closest counterpart. The Second Day addresses the question of the strength of materials.

The Third and Fourth days address the science of motion. The Third day discusses uniform and naturally accelerated motion, the issue of terminal velocity having been addressed in the First day. The Fourth day discusses projectile motion.

In &quot;Two Sciences&quot; uniform motion is defined as a motion that, over &quot;any&quot; equal periods of time, covers equal distance. With the use of the quantifier ″any″, uniformity is introduced and expressed more explicitly than in previous definitions.

Galileo had started an additional day on the force of percussion, but was not able to complete it to his own satisfaction. This section was referenced frequently in the first four days of discussion. It finally appeared only in the 1718 edition of Galilei&#x27;s works. and it is often quoted as &quot;Sixth Day&quot; following the numbering in the 1898 edition. During this additional day Simplicio was replaced by Aproino, a former scholar and assistant of Galileo in Padua.

== Summary ==
Page numbers at the start of each paragraph are from the 1898 version, presently adopted as standard, and are found in the Crew and Drake translations.

=== Day one: Resistance of bodies to separation ===
[50] Preliminary discussions.
Sagredo (taken to be the younger Galileo) cannot understand why with machines one cannot argue from the small to the large: &quot;I do not see that the properties of circles, triangles and...solid figures should change with their size&quot;. Salviati (speaking for Galileo) says the common opinion is wrong. Scale matters: a horse falling from a height of 3 or 4 cubits will break its bones whereas a cat falling from twice the height won&#x27;t, nor will a grasshopper falling from a tower.

[56] The first example is a hemp rope which is constructed from small fibres which bind together in the same way as a rope round a windlass to produce something much stronger. Then the vacuum that prevents two highly polished plates from separating even though they slide easily gives rise to an experiment to test whether water can be expanded or whether a vacuum is caused. In fact, Sagredo had observed that a suction pump could not lift more than 18 cubits of water and Salviati observes that the weight of this is the amount of resistance to a void. The discussion turns to the strength of a copper wire and whether there are minute void spaces inside the metal or whether there is some other explanation for its strength.

[68] This leads into a discussion of infinites and the continuum and thence to the observation that the number of squares equal the number of roots. He comes eventually to the view that &quot;if any number can be said to be infinite, it must be unity&quot; and demonstrates a construction in which an infinite circle is approached and another to divide a line.

[85] The difference between a fine dust and a liquid leads to a discussion of light and how the concentrated power of the sun can melt metals. He deduces that light has motion and describes an (unsuccessful) attempt to measure its speed.

[106] Aristotle believed that bodies fell at a speed proportional to weight but Salviati doubts that Aristotle ever tested this. He also did not believe that motion in a void was possible, but since air is much less dense than water Salviati asserts that in a medium devoid of resistance (a vacuum) all bodies—a lock of wool or a bit of lead—would fall at the same speed. Large and small bodies fall at the same speed through air or water providing they are of the same density. Since ebony weighs a thousand times as much as air (which he had measured), it will fall only a very little more slowly than lead which weighs ten times as much. But shape also matters—even a piece of gold leaf (the densest of all substances [asserts Salviati]) floats through the air and a bladder filled with air falls much more slowly than lead.

[128] Measuring the speed of a fall is difficult because of the small time intervals involved and his first way round this used pendulums of the same length but with lead or cork weights. The period of oscillation was the same, even when the cork was swung more widely to compensate for the fact that it soon stopped.

[139] This leads to a discussion of the vibration of strings and he suggests that not only the length of the string is important for pitch but also the tension and the weight of the string.

=== Day two: Cause of cohesion ===
[151] Salviati proves that a balance can not only be used with equal arms but with unequal arms with weights inversely proportional to the distances from the fulcrum. Following this he shows that the moment of a weight suspended by a beam supported at one end is proportional to the square of the length. The resistance to fracture of beams of various sizes and thicknesses is demonstrated, supported at one or both ends.

[169] He shows that animal bones have to be proportionately larger for larger animals and the length of a cylinder that will break under its own weight. He proves that the best place to break a stick placed upon the knee is the middle and shows how far along a beam that a larger weight can be placed without breaking it.

[178] He proves that the optimum shape for a beam supported at one end and bearing a load at the other is parabolic. He also shows that hollow cylinders are stronger than solid ones of the same weight.

=== Day three: Naturally accelerated motion ===
[191] He first defines uniform (steady) motion and shows the relationship between speed, time and distance. He then defines uniformly accelerated motion where the speed increases by the same amount in increments of time. Falling bodies start very slowly and he sets out to show that their velocity increases in simple proportionality to time, not to distance which he shows is impossible.

[208] He shows that the distance travelled in naturally accelerated motion is proportional to the square of the time. He describes an experiment in which a steel ball was rolled down a groove in a piece of wooden moulding 12 cubits long (about 5.5m) with one end raised by one or two cubits. This was repeated, measuring times by accurately weighing the amount of water that came out of a thin pipe in a jet from the bottom of a large jug of water. By this means he was able to verify the uniformly accelerated motion. He then shows that whatever the inclination of the plane, the square of the time taken to fall a given vertical height is proportional to the inclined distance.

[221] He next considers descent along the chords of a circle, showing that the time is the same as that falling from the vertex, and various other combinations of planes. He gives an erroneous solution to the brachistochrone problem, claiming to prove that the arc of the circle is the fastest descent. 16 problems with solutions are given.

=== Day four: The motion of projectiles ===

[268] The motion of projectiles consists of a combination of uniform horizontal motion and a naturally accelerated vertical motion which produces a parabolic curve. Two motions at right angles can be calculated using the sum of the squares. He shows in detail how to construct the parabolas in various situations and gives tables for altitude and range depending on the projected angle.

[274] Air resistance shows itself in two ways: by affecting less dense bodies more and by offering greater resistance to faster bodies. A lead ball will fall slightly faster than an oak ball, but the difference with a stone ball is negligible. However the speed does not go on increasing indefinitely but reaches a maximum. Though at small speeds the effect of air resistance is small, it is greater when considering, say, a ball fired from a cannon.

[292] The effect of a projectile hitting a target is reduced if the target is free to move. The velocity of a moving body can overcome that of a larger body if its speed is proportionately greater than the resistance.

[310] A cord or chain stretched out is never level but also approximates to a parabola. (But see also catenary.)

=== Additional day: The force of percussion ===
[323] What is the weight of water falling from a bucket hanging on a balance arm onto another bucket suspended to the same arm?

[325] Piling of wooden poles for foundations; hammers and the force of percussion.

[336] Speed of fall along inclined planes; again on the principle of inertia.

== Methodology ==
Many contemporary scientists, such as Gassendi, dispute Galileo&#x27;s methodology for conceptualizing his law of falling bodies. Two of the main arguments are that his epistemology followed the example of Platonist thought or hypothetico-deductivist. It has now been considered to be &quot;ex suppositione&quot;, or knowing the how and why effects from past events in order to determine the requirements for the production of similar effects in the future. Galilean methodology mirrored that of Aristotelian and Archimedean epistemology. Following a letter from Cardinal Bellarmine in 1615 Galileo distinguished his arguments and Copernicus&#x27; as natural suppositions as opposed to the &quot;fictive&quot; that are &quot;introduced only for the sake of astronomical computations,&quot; such as Ptolemy&#x27;s hypothesis on eccentrics and equants.

Galileo&#x27;s earlier writing considered Juvenilia, or youthful writings, are considered his first attempts at creating lecture notes for his course &quot;hypothesis of the celestial motions&quot; while teaching in at the University of Padua. These notes mirrored those of his contemporaries at the Collegio as well as contained an &quot;Aristotelian context with decided Thomistic (St. Thomas Aquinas) overtones.&quot; These earlier papers are believed to have encouraged him to apply demonstrative proof in order to give validity to his discoveries on motion.

Discovery of folio 116v gives evidence of experiments that had previously not been reported and therefore demonstrated Galileo&#x27;s actual calculations for the Law of Falling Bodies.

His methods of experimentation have been proved by the recording and recreation done by scientists such as James MacLachlan, Stillman Drake, R.H. Taylor and others in order to prove he did not merely imagine his ideas as historian Alexandre Koyré argued, but sought to prove them mathematically.

Galileo believed that knowledge could be acquired through reason, and reinforced through observation and experimentation. Thus, it can be argued that Galileo was a rationalist, and also that he was an empiricist.

== The two new sciences ==
The two sciences mentioned in the title are the strength of materials and the motion of objects (the forebears of modern material engineering and kinematics). In the title of the book &quot;mechanics&quot; and &quot;motion&quot; are separate, since at Galileo&#x27;s time &quot;mechanics&quot; meant only statics and strength of materials.

=== The science of materials ===
The discussion begins with a demonstration of the reasons that a large structure proportioned in exactly the same way as a smaller one must necessarily be weaker known as the square–cube law. Later in the discussion this principle is applied to the thickness required of the bones of a large animal, possibly the first quantitative result in biology, anticipating J. B. S. Haldane&#x27;s work &quot;On Being the Right Size, and other essays,&quot; edited by John Maynard Smith.

=== The motion of objects ===
Galileo expresses clearly for the first time the constant acceleration of a falling body which he was able to measure accurately by slowing it down using an inclined plane.

In &quot;Two New Sciences&quot;, Galileo (Salviati speaks for him) used a wood molding, &quot;12 cubits long, half a cubit wide and three finger-breadths thick&quot; as a ramp with a straight, smooth, polished groove to study rolling balls (&quot;a hard, smooth and very round bronze ball&quot;). He lined the groove with &quot;parchment, also smooth and polished as possible&quot;. He inclined the ramp at various angles, effectively slowing down the acceleration enough so that he could measure the elapsed time. He would let the ball roll a known distance down the ramp, and use a water clock to measure the time taken to move the known distance. This clock was
a large vessel of water placed in an elevated position; to the bottom of this vessel was soldered a pipe of small diameter giving a thin jet of water, which we collected in a small glass during the time of each descent, whether for the whole length of the channel or for a part of its length. The water collected was weighed, and after each descent on a very accurate balance, the differences and ratios of these weights gave him the differences and ratios of the times. This was done with such accuracy that although the operation was repeated many, many times, there was no appreciable discrepancy in the results.

==== The law of falling bodies ====
While Aristotle had observed that heavier objects fall more quickly than lighter ones, in &quot;Two New Sciences&quot; Galileo postulated that this was due &quot;not&quot; to inherently stronger forces acting on the heavier objects, but to the countervailing forces of air resistance and friction. To compensate, he conducted experiments using a shallowly inclined ramp, smoothed so as to eliminate as much friction as possible, on which he rolled down balls of different weights. In this manner, he was able to provide empirical evidence that matter accelerates vertically downward at a constant rate, regardless of mass, due to the effects of gravity.

The unreported experiment found in folio 116V tested the constant rate of acceleration in falling bodies due to gravity. This experiment consisted of dropping a ball from specified heights onto a deflector in order to transfer its motion from vertical to horizontal. The data from the inclined plane experiments were used to calculate the expected horizontal motion. However, discrepancies were found in the results of the experiment: the observed horizontal distances disagreed with the calculated distances expected for a constant rate of acceleration. Galileo attributed the discrepancies to air resistance in the unreported experiment, and friction in the inclined plane experiment. These discrepancies forced Galileo to assert that the postulate held only under &quot;ideal conditions,&quot; i.e., in the absence of friction and/or air resistance.

==== Bodies in motion ====
Aristotelian physics argued that the Earth must not move as humans are unable to perceive the effects of this motion. A popular justification of this is the experiment of an archer shooting an arrow straight up into the air. If the Earth were moving, Aristotle argued, the arrow should fall in a different location than the launch point. Galileo refuted this argument in &quot;Dialogues Concerning the Two Chief World Systems&quot;. He provided the example of sailors aboard a boat at sea. The boat is obviously in motion, but the sailors are unable to perceive this motion. If a sailor were to drop a weighted object from the mast, this object would fall at the base of the mast rather than behind it (due to the ship&#x27;s forward motion). This was the result of simultaneously the horizontal and vertical motion of the ship, sailors, and ball.

==== Relativity of motions ====

One of Galileo&#x27;s experiments regarding falling bodies was that describing the relativity of motions, explaining that, under the right circumstances, &quot;one motion may be superimposed upon another without effect upon either...&quot;. In &quot;Two New Sciences&quot;, Galileo made his case for this argument and it would become the basis of Newton&#x27;s first law, the law of inertia.

He poses the question of what happens to a ball dropped from the mast of a sailing ship or an arrow fired into the air on the deck. According to Aristotle&#x27;s physics, the ball dropped should land at the stern of the ship as it falls straight down from the point of origin. Likewise the arrow when fired straight up should not land in the same spot if the ship is in motion. Galileo offers that there are two independent motions at play. One is the accelerating vertical motion caused by gravity while the other is the uniform horizontal motion caused by the moving ship which continues to influence the trajectory of the ball through the principle of inertia. The combination of these two motions results in a parabolic curve. The observer cannot identify this parabolic curve because the ball and observer share the horizontal movement imparted to them by the ship, meaning only the perpendicular, vertical motion is perceivable. Surprisingly, nobody had tested this theory with the simple experiments needed to gain a conclusive result until Pierre Gassendi published the results of said experiments in his letters entitled &quot;De Motu Impresso a Motore Translato&quot; (1642).

== Infinity ==
The book also contains a discussion of infinity. Galileo considers the example of numbers and their squares. He starts by noting that:
It cannot be denied that there are as many [squares] as there are numbers because every number is a [square] root of some square:

1 ↔ 1, 2 ↔ 4, 3 ↔ 9, 4 ↔ 16, and so on. 

But he notes what appears to be a contradiction:
Yet at the outset we said there are many more numbers than squares, since the larger portion of them are not squares. Not only so, but the proportionate number of squares diminishes as we pass to larger numbers.

(In modern language, there is a bijection between the set of positive integers N and the set of squares S, and S is a proper subset of N of density zero.) He resolves the contradiction by denying the possibility of comparing infinite numbers (and of comparing infinite and finite numbers):
We can only infer that the totality of all numbers is infinite, that the number of squares is infinite, and that the number of their roots is infinite; neither is the number of squares less than the totality of all numbers, nor the latter greater than the former; and finally the attributes &quot;equal,&quot; greater,&quot; and &quot;less,&quot; are not applicable to infinite, but only to finite, quantities.
This conclusion, that ascribing sizes to infinite sets should be ruled impossible, owing to the contradictory results obtained from these two ostensibly natural ways of attempting to do so, is a resolution to the problem that is consistent with, but less powerful than, the methods used in modern mathematics. The resolution to the problem may be generalized by considering Galileo&#x27;s first definition of what it means for sets to have equal sizes, that is, the ability to put them in one-to-one correspondence. This turns out to yield a way of comparing the sizes of infinite sets that is free from contradictory results.

These issues of infinity arise from problems of rolling circles. If two concentric circles of different radii roll along lines, then if the larger does not slip it appears clear that the smaller must slip. But in what way? Galileo attempts to clarify the matter by considering hexagons and then extending to rolling 100 000-gons, or n-gons, where he shows that a finite number of finite slips occur on the inner shape. Eventually, he concludes &quot;the line traversed by the larger circle consists then of an infinite number of points which completely fill it; while that which is traced by the smaller circle consists of an infinite number of points which leave empty spaces and only partly fill the line,&quot; which would not be considered satisfactory now.

== Reactions by commentators ==


Part of &quot;Two New Sciences&quot; was pure mathematics, as has been pointed out by the mathematician Alfréd Rényi, who said that it was the most significant book on mathematics in over 2000 years: Greek mathematics did not deal with motion, and so they never formulated mathematical laws of motion, even though Archimedes developed differentiation and integration. &quot;Two New Sciences&quot; opened the way to treating physics mathematically by treating motion mathematically for the first time. The Greek mathematician Zeno had designed his paradoxes to prove that motion could not be treated mathematically, and that any attempt to do so would lead to paradoxes. (He regarded this as an inevitable limitation of mathematics.) Aristotle reinforced this belief, saying that mathematic could only deal with abstract objects that were immutable. Galileo used the very methods of the Greeks to show that motion could indeed be treated mathematically. His idea was to separate out the paradoxes of the infinite from Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes. He did this in several steps. First, he showed that the infinite sequence S of the squares 1, 4, 9, 16, ...contained as many elements as the sequence N of all positive integers (infinity); this is now referred to as Galileo&#x27;s paradox. Then, using Greek style geometry, he showed a short line interval contained as many points as a longer interval. At some point he formulates the general principle that a smaller infinite set can have just as many points as a larger infinite set containing it. It was then clear that Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes on motion resulted entirely from this paradoxical behavior of infinite quantities. Renyi said that, having removed this 2000-year-old stumbling block, Galileo went on to introduce his mathematical laws of motion, anticipating Newton.

=== Gassendi&#x27;s thoughts ===
Pierre Gassendi defended Galileo&#x27;s opinions in his book, &quot;De Motu Impresso a Motore Translato&quot;. In Howard Jones&#x27; article, &quot;Gassendi&#x27;s Defence of Galileo: The Politics of Discretion&quot;, Jones says Gassendi displayed an understanding of Galileo&#x27;s arguments and a clear grasp of their implications for the physical objections to the earth&#x27;s motion.

=== Koyré&#x27;s thoughts ===
The law of falling bodies was published by Galileo in 1638. But in the 20th century some authorities challenged the reality of Galileo&#x27;s experiments. In particular, the French historian of science Alexandre Koyré bases his doubt on the fact that the experiments reported in &quot;Two New Sciences&quot; to determine the law of acceleration of falling bodies, required accurate measurements of time which appeared to be impossible with the technology of 1600. According to Koyré, the law was created deductively, and the experiments were merely illustrative thought experiments. In fact, Galileo&#x27;s water clock (described above) provided sufficiently accurate measurements of time to confirm his conjectures.

Later research, however, has validated the experiments. The experiments on falling bodies (actually rolling balls) were replicated using the methods described by Galileo, and the precision of the results was consistent with Galileo&#x27;s report. Later research into Galileo&#x27;s unpublished working papers from 1604 clearly showed the reality of the experiments and even indicated the particular results that led to the time-squared law.

<text>Sir Walter Mildmay (bef. 1523 – 31 May 1589) was a statesman who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer to Queen Elizabeth I, and founded Emmanuel College, Cambridge.

==Origins==
He was born at Moulsham in Essex, the fourth and youngest son of Thomas Mildmay, later auditor of the Court of Augmentations under Henry VIII, by his wife Agnes Read. As the Commissioner for receiving the surrender of the monasteries at the Dissolution, his father Thomas made a large fortune and in 1540 acquired the manor of Moulsham, near Chelmsford in Essex, where he built a fine mansion.

===Collateral line===
Walter&#x27;s elder brother Sir Thomas Mildmay (d. 1566) of Moulsham, was auditor of the Court of Augmentations, established in 1537 for allocating the property taken by the Crown from the monasteries. He was buried in Chelmsford Church, where his monument survived in 1878. Sir Thomas Mildmay was the grandfather of Sir Thomas Mildmay, 1st Baronet (d. 1626), created a baronet in 1611, and of Sir Henry Mildmay (d. 1654), a knight. Henry claimed, in right of his mother Frances Radcliffe, a daughter of Henry Radclyffe, 2nd Earl of Sussex, 3rd Baron FitzWalter (1507–1557), the barony of FitzWalter, and on 10 February 1670 his grandson Benjamin Mildmay, 17th Baron FitzWalter (c. 1646–1679), was summoned to the House of Lords by that title. Benjamin&#x27;s two sons were Charles Mildmay, 18th Baron FitzWalter (1670–1728) and Benjamin Mildmay, 1st Earl FitzWalter, 1st Viscount Harwich, 19th Baron FitzWalter (1672–1756), the latter being further created Viscount Harwich and Earl FitzWalter in 1730. On Earl FitzWalter&#x27;s death in 1756, the earldom became extinct and the barony fell into abeyance.

==Career==

Mildmay was educated at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, but as was common at the time, especially for those not intending to enter the church, did not take a degree. He later became a student of law at Gray&#x27;s Inn (1546), and there obtained some employment under his father in the Court of Augmentations. When the Court of Augmentation was reconstituted, about 1545, Mildmay was made one of its two surveyors-general. During Edward VI&#x27;s reign, Mildmay extended his official connection. 

On 22 February 1546/47 he was knighted, and on 14 September prepared, along with three others, an inventory of the late King&#x27;s wardrobe. Sixteen days later he was appointed a commissioner to report upon the Crown revenues. In 1548 he acted on commissions for the sale of lands (March) and for the maintenance of such grammar schools as had belonged to the dissolved chantries. After the Duke of Somerset&#x27;s arrest he was ordered by the Privy Council on 12 November 1549, to examine the Palace of Westminster, which had been in the Duke&#x27;s custody, and, on 8 March 1550/51, to take charge of the Duke&#x27;s property at Syon House.

For his services, he received many grants of land in Gloucestershire and Berkshire, some of which he exchanged for manors in Oxfordshire and Northamptonshire; other grants of land in Cornwall, Essex and London soon followed. He fixed his country residence at Apethorpe Palace, Northamptonshire, which was granted to him in 1552, and was confirmed to him in 1556. When in London he lived in the parish of St Bartholomew-the-Great.

Mildmay soon proved himself a skillful financier. In 1550 he was directed, together with the Earl of Warwick and Sir William Herbert, to examine the accounts of the King&#x27;s mints, and in 1551 superintended the establishment of a new mint at York. In December 1551 he was a commissioner to inspect the Courts which controlled the Crown lands.
*On 2 January 1552 he was commissioned to levy the King&#x27;s debts;
*On 21 November to settle with the Crown accountants the effect of a fall in the value of money;
*In December to audit the funds belonging to the king&#x27;s officers; and
*In that and the next year he superintended the receipt by the crown of plate, jewels, bells, and the like surrendered by dissolved monasteries or chantries.

Mildmay was elected MP for Lostwithiel in 1545, for Lewes in 1547 and Maldon on 1 March 1553, and then for Peterborough on 5 October 1553. Although a committed Calvinist, Queen Mary&#x27;s accession did not appreciably depress his fortunes, and before her death he was employed on Government business. On 9 January 1558, he was appointed treasurer of the forces sent to the relief of Calais and was chosen as knight of the shire to represent Northamptonshire in the parliament meeting in January 1557; after this he represented that constituency eight times until his death.

Under Queen Elizabeth, with whom he regularly exchanged New-Year&#x27;s gifts, his influence steadily grew. On her accession he was at once made treasurer of her household, and was appointed a member of a small committee of ways and means to supply the empty exchequer. He was soon employed in preparing a census of the farms of the royal revenues (22 December 1558), in examining Queen Mary&#x27;s grants of land, in compounding with those who refused knighthood (28 March 1559), in directing the issue of a new coinage (29 October 1560), and in selling crown lands (May 1563).

On 21 April 1566, Sir Richard Sackville, the chancellor of the exchequer, died, and Mildmay was appointed as his replacement; he was also made auditor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Occupied in the duties of his offices until his death, he concerned himself little with general politics. As the brother-in-law of Francis Walsingham and the friend of Lord Burghley, he was, however, always heard with attention in the Privy Council, the Star Chamber, and in Parliament. He used what influence he possessed to shield the Puritans from the attacks of the bishops, and often urged the Queen to intervene on behalf of the Protestants in the Low Countries. In his speeches in Parliament he argued that a liberal grant of subsidies placed the government under an obligation to redress grievances, and thus identified himself with the popular party in the commons.

In 1572 he helped to prepare evidence against Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, who, nevertheless, after his condemnation gave him some rich jewels. His nephew Sir Christopher Peyton was appointed Auditor General of Ireland in 1584.

The affairs of Mary, Queen of Scots, also occasionally occupied his attention. When she arrived in England in 1567 he strongly advised her detention. In October 1577 he and Cecil visited her at Chatsworth, after she had announced that she had important secrets to reveal to Elizabeth. 

In 1586, he went to Fotheringhay Castle and informed her of her forthcoming trial, in which he took part as one of the special commissioners. In March 1587 he urged the condemnation of William Davison in the Star Chamber. Although four times nominated an ambassador to Scotland, in 1565, 1580, 1582, and 1583, he was on each occasion detained at home, but when his name was suggested for the office in 1589, James VI expressed great readiness to receive him. Mildmay&#x27;s illness, however, brought the suggestion to nothing.

Mildmay died at Hackney on 31 May 1589, and is buried beside his wife in the church of St Bartholomew-the-Great in London, where an elaborate monument exists to his memory. The decorations are heraldic, but the Latin epitaph merely records names and dates. The tomb was restored in 1865 by Henry Bingham Mildmay. 

Epitaphs on Mildmay and Sir John Calthrop were licensed by the Stationers&#x27; Company on 29 July 1589. They are not known to be extant.

==Founder of Emmanuel College, Cambridge==

Mildmay displayed his interest in education with much effect. On 23 November 1583 he purchased for £550 the site of Cambridge Blackfriars, a dissolved house of the Dominican Order, which was situated in what was then called Preachers Street, but is now known as St Andrew&#x27;s Street. On 11 January 1584, he obtained the Queen&#x27;s licence to set up Emmanuel College there.

The architect was Ralph Symons, and in 1588 the new building was opened with a dedication festival, which Mildmay attended. He installed in the college a master, Laurence Chaderton, three fellows, and four scholars; but subsequent benefactions soon increased the fellowships to fourteen and the scholarships to fifty. According to Thomas Fuller, Mildmay, on coming to court, after the college was opened was addressed by the Queen with the words: &quot;Sir Walter, I hear you have erected a puritan foundation&quot;, to which Mildmay replied: &quot;No, madam; far be it from me to countenance anything contrary to your established laws; but I have set an acorn, which when it becomes an oak, God alone knows what will be the fruit thereof&quot;.

His statutes for the government of Emmanuel College are dated 1 October 1585 and are attested by his sons, Anthony and Humphrey, John Hammond, LL.D., William Lewyn, LL.D., Thomas Byng, LL.D., Timothy Bright, M.D., and Edward Downing. Mildmay deprecated perpetual fellowships, and warned the fellows against regarding the college as &quot;a perpetual abode&quot; — they were to look forward to spreading outside the knowledge they acquired within its walls.

Mildmay otherwise showed his interest in education by acting as an original governor of Chelmsford Chantry School, now King Edward VI Grammar School, founded in 1550–1; by giving an annuity of 52s. to Christ&#x27;s Hospital (10 April 1556); and by bestowing £20 a year on Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge (10 March 1568 – 1569), to be expended on a Greek lectureship, six scholarships and a preachership to be filled by a fellow of the college. He also contributed stone for completing the tower of Great St Mary&#x27;s Church, Cambridge, and he helped to found the free-school at Middleton, Lancashire.

There are three portraits of Mildmay at Emmanuel College; one with his wife. A fourth painting was at Moulsham Hall, demolished in 1809, near Chelmsford, and a fifth at Knole, Sevenoaks. There are also engravings by J. Faber and E. Harding, and an unsigned plate is known.

==Character and publications==
Sidney Lee wrote that Mildmay was a man of cultivation and of great piety, with some popular reputation as a believer in second sight. Henry Caesar, dean of Ely, was directed by the Star Chamber to retract a report that he had circulated to the effect that Mildmay had endeavoured to see by conjuration the person of Cardinal Pole after his death.

Henry Roberts, in his &quot;Fames Trumpet Soundinge&quot; (1589), mentions a book by Mildmay, and describes it as &quot;in print now extant&quot;. It was entitled &quot;A Note to know a Good Man.&quot; Sir John Harington, in his &quot;Orlando Furioso,&quot; bk. xxii, p. 175, gives a stanza in Latin with an English translation; the former he says he derived from Mildmay&#x27;s Latin poems, which are not otherwise known. A &quot;memorial&quot; by Mildmay, written for his son Anthony in 1570, consisting of sensible moral precepts, was printed from a manuscript at Apethorpe by the Rev. Arundell St John-Mildmay in 1893. Many of his official letters and papers are at Hatfield or in the state paper office.

==Marriage and issue==
Mildmay married Mary Walsingham (died 16 March 1576), a daughter of William Walsingham by his wife Joyce (or Joice), a daughter of Edmund Denny, a Baron of the Exchequer, and a sister of Sir Francis Walsingham. By his wife he had issue including:
*Sir Anthony Mildmay (d.1617), of Apethorpe, eldest son and heir, an ambassador to France, who married Grace Sharington by whom he had one daughter Mary Mildmay.
*Humphrey Mildmay of Danbury Place, Essex, father of Sir Henry Mildmay; 
*Winifred Mildmay, wife of Sir William Fitzwilliam of Gains Park, Essex; 
*Martha Mildmay, wife of Sir William Brouncker; 
*Christiana Mildmay, wife successively of Charles Barrett of Aveley in Essex, and Sir John Leveson of Kent, Knight.

<doc id="268487" wikidata="Q17010135" url="?curid=268487" title="Deficit spending">
<text>Within the budgetary process, deficit spending is the amount by which spending exceeds revenue over a particular period of time, also called simply deficit, or budget deficit, the opposite of budget surplus. The term may be applied to the budget of a government, private company, or individual. A central point of controversy in economics, government deficit spending was first identified as a necessary economic tool by John Maynard Keynes in the wake of the Great Depression.

== Controversy ==
Government deficit spending is a central point of controversy in economics, with prominent economists holding differing views.

The mainstream economics position is that deficit spending is desirable and necessary as part of countercyclical fiscal policy, but that there should not be a structural deficit (i.e., permanent deficit): The government should run deficits during recessions to compensate for the shortfall in aggregate demand, but should run surpluses in boom times so that there is no net deficit over an economic cycle (i.e., only run cyclical deficits and not structural deficits). This is derived from Keynesian economics, and gained acceptance during the period between the Great Depression in the 1930s and post-WWII in the 1950s.

This position is attacked from both sides: Advocates of federal-level fiscal conservatism argue that deficit spending is always bad policy, while some post-Keynesian economists—particularly neo-chartalists or proponents of Modern Monetary Theory—argue that deficit spending is necessary for the issuance of new money, and not only for fiscal stimulus. According to most economists, during recessions, the government can stimulate the economy by intentionally running a deficit.

The deficit spending requested by John Maynard Keynes for overcoming crises is the monetary side of his economy theory. As investment equates to real saving, money assets that build up are equivalent to debt capacity. Therefore, the excess saving of money in time of crisis should correspond to increased levels of borrowing, as this generally doesn&#x27;t happen - the result is intensification of the crisis, as revenues from which money could be saved decline while a higher level of debt is needed to compensate for the collapsing revenues. The state&#x27;s deficit enables a correspondent buildup of money assets for the private sector and prevents the breakdown of the economy, preventing private money savings to be run down by private debt.

The monetary mechanism describing how revenue surpluses enforce corresponding expense surpluses, and how these in turn lead to economic breakdown was explained by Wolfgang Stützel much later by the means of his Balances Mechanics.

William Vickrey, awarded the 1996 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, identified deficits being viewed as profligate spending as his #1 fallacy of Financial Fundamentalism when he commented: 

=== Fiscal conservatism ===
Advocates of fiscal conservatism reject Keynesianism by arguing that government should &quot;always&quot; run a balanced budget (and a surplus to pay down any outstanding debt), and that deficit spending is &quot;always&quot; bad policy. The neoclassical-inclined Chicago school of economics has supported fiscal conservative ideas. Numerous states of the United States have a balanced budget amendment to their state constitution, and the Stability and Growth Pact of the European Monetary Union punishes government deficits of 3% of GDP or greater.

Proponents of fiscal conservatism date back to Adam Smith, founder of modern economics. Fiscal conservatism was the dominant position until the Great Depression, associated with the gold standard and expressed in the now outdated Treasury View that government fiscal policy is ineffective.

The usual argument against deficit spending is the Government-Household analogy: &quot;households&quot; should not run deficits—one should have money before one spends it, from prudence—and that what is correct for a household is correct for a nation and its government. A similar argument is that deficit spending today will require increased taxation in the future, thus burdening future generations. (See generational accounting for discussion.)

Others argue that because debt is both owed &quot;by&quot; and owed &quot;to&quot; private individuals, there is no &quot;net&quot; debt burden of government debt, just wealth transfer (redistribution) from those who owe debt (government, backed by tax payers) to those who hold debt (holders of government bonds).

A related line of argument, associated with the Austrian school of economics, is that government deficits are inflationary. Anything other than mild or moderate inflation is generally accepted in economics to be a bad thing. In practice this is argued to be because governments pay off debts by printing money, increasing the money supply and creating inflation, and is taken further by some as an argument against fiat money and in favor of hard money, especially the gold standard.

=== Post-Keynesian economics ===
Some Post-Keynesian economists argue that deficit spending is &quot;necessary,&quot; either to create the money supply (Chartalism) or to satisfy demand for savings in excess of what can be satisfied by private investment.

Chartalists argue that deficit spending is logically necessary because, in their view, fiat money is &quot;created&quot; by deficit spending: fiat money cannot be collected in taxes before it is issued &quot;and spent&quot;; the amount of fiat money in circulation is exactly the government debt—money spent but not collected in taxes. In a quip, &quot;fiat money governments are &#x27;spend and tax&#x27;, not &#x27;tax and spend&#x27;&quot;—deficit spending comes first.

Chartalists argue that nations are fundamentally different from households. Governments in a fiat money system which only have debt in their own currency can issue other liabilities, their fiat money, to pay off their interest bearing bond debt. They cannot go bankrupt involuntarily because this fiat money is what is used in their economy to settle debts, while household liabilities are not so used. This view is summarized as:
Continuing in this vein, Chartalists argue that a structural deficit is &quot;necessary&quot; for monetary expansion in an expanding economy: if the economy grows, the money supply should as well, which should be accomplished by government deficit spending. Private sector savings are equal to government sector deficits, to the penny. In the absence of sufficient deficit spending, money supply can increase by increasing financial leverage in the economy—the amount of bank money grows, while the base money supply remains unchanged or grows at a slower rate, and thus the ratio (leverage = credit/base) increases—which can lead to a credit bubble and a financial crisis.

Chartalism is a small minority view in economics; while it has had advocates over the years, and influenced Keynes, who specifically credited it, A notable proponent was Ukrainian-American economist Abba P. Lerner, who founded the school of Neo-Chartalism, and advocated deficit spending in his theory of functional finance. A contemporary center of Neo-Chartalism is the Kansas City School of economics.

Chartalists, like other Keynesians, accept the paradox of thrift, which argues that identifying behavior of individual households and the nation as a whole commits the fallacy of composition; while the paradox of thrift (and thus deficit spending for fiscal stimulus) is widely accepted in economics, the Chartalist form is not.

An alternative argument for the necessity of deficits was given by U.S. economist William Vickrey, who argued that deficits were necessary to satisfy demand for savings in excess of what can be satisfied by private investment.
==Government deficits==
When the outlay of a government (i.e., the total of its purchases of goods and services, transfers in grants to individuals and corporations, and its net interest payments) exceeds its tax revenues, the government budget is said to be in deficit; government spending in excess of tax receipts is known as deficit spending. For a government that uses accrual accounting (rather than cash accounting) the budget balance is calculated using only spending on current operations, with expenditure on new capital assets excluded.

Governments usually issue bonds to match their deficits. They can be bought by its Central Bank through open market operations. Otherwise the debt issuance can increase the level of (i) public debt, (ii) private sector net worth, (iii) debt service (interest payments), and (iv) interest rates. (See Crowding out below.) Deficit spending may, however, be consistent with public debt remaining stable as a proportion of GDP, depending on the level of GDP growth.

The opposite of a budget deficit is a budget surplus; in this case, tax revenues exceed government purchases and transfer payments. For the public sector to be in deficit implies that the private sector (domestic and foreign) is in surplus. An increase in public indebtedness must necessarily therefore correspond to an equal decrease in private sector net indebtedness. In other words, deficit spending permits the private sector to accumulate net worth.

On average, through the economic cycle, most governments have tended to run budget deficits, as can be seen from the large debt balances accumulated by governments across the world.

===Keynesian effect===
Following John Maynard Keynes, many economists recommend deficit spending to moderate or end a recession, especially a severe one. When the economy has high unemployment, an increase in government purchases creates a market for business output, creating income and encouraging increases in consumer spending, which creates further increases in the demand for business output. (This is the multiplier effect.) This raises the real gross domestic product (GDP) and the employment of labour, and if all else is constant, lowers the unemployment rate. (The connection between demand for GDP and unemployment is called Okun&#x27;s law.)

The increased size of the market, due to government deficits, can further stimulate the economy by raising business profitability and spurring optimism, which encourages private fixed investment in factories, machines, and the like to rise. This accelerator effect stimulates demand further and encourages rising employment.

Similarly, running a government surplus or reducing its deficit reduces consumer and business spending and raises unemployment. This can lower the inflation rate. Any use of the government deficit to steer the macro-economy is called fiscal policy.

A deficit does not simply stimulate demand. If private investment is stimulated, that increases the ability of the economy to supply output in the long run. Also, if the government&#x27;s deficit is spent on such things as infrastructure, basic research, public health, and education, that can also increase potential output in the long run. Finally, the high demand that a government deficit provides may actually allow greater growth of potential supply, following Verdoorn&#x27;s law.

Deficit spending may create inflation, or encourage existing inflation to persist. For example, in the United States Vietnam-war era deficits encouraged inflation. This is especially true at low unemployment rates. But government deficits are not the only cause of inflation: It can arise due to such supply-side shocks as the oil crises of the 1970s and inflation left over from the past (e.g., inflationary expectations and the price/wage spiral).

If equilibrium is located on the classical range of the supply graph, an increase in government spending will lead to inflation without affecting unemployment. There must also be enough money circulating in the system to allow inflation to persist, so that inflation depends on monetary policy.

===Loanable funds===
Many economists believe government deficits influence the economy through the loanable funds market, whose existence Chartalists and other Post-Keynesians dispute. Government borrowing in this market increases the demand for loanable funds and thus (ignoring other changes) pushes up interest rates. Rising interest rates can crowd out, or discourage, fixed private investment spending, canceling out some or even all of the demand stimulus arising from the deficit—and perhaps hurting long-term supply-side growth.

Increased deficits also raise the amount of total income received, which raises the amount of saving done by individuals and corporations and thus the supply of loanable funds, lowering interest rates. Thus, crowding out is a problem only when the economy is already close to full employment (say, at about 4% unemployment) and the scope for increasing income and saving is blocked by resource constraints (potential output).

Despite a government debt that exceeded GDP in 1945, the U.S. saw the long prosperity of the 1950s and 1960s. The growth of the supply side, it seems, was not hurt by the large deficits and debts.

A government deficit increases government debt. In many countries the government borrows by selling bonds rather than borrowing from banks. The most important burden of this debt is the interest that must be paid to bond-holders, which restricts a government&#x27;s ability to raise its outlays or cut taxes to attain other goals.

===Crowding out===

Usually when economists use the term &quot;crowding out&quot; they are referring to the government spending using up financial and other resources that would otherwise be used by private enterprise. However, some commentators use &quot;crowding out&quot; to refer to government providing a service or good that would otherwise be a business opportunity for private industry.

===Unintentional deficits===
National government deficits may be intentional, a result of policy decisions, or unintentional. When an economy goes into a recession, deficits usually rise in the more affluent countries. Revenue from progressive taxes based on economic activity (income, expenditure, or transactions) falls. Other sources of tax revenue such as wealth taxes, notably property taxes, are not subject to recessions, though they are subject to asset price bubbles. Transfer payments due to increased unemployment and reduced household income rise.

===Automatic vs. active deficit policies===

Most economists favor the use of automatic stabilization over active or discretionary use of deficits to fight mild recessions (or surpluses to combat inflation). Active policy-making takes too long for politicians to institute and too long to affect the economy. Often, the medicine ends up affecting the economy only after its disease has been cured, leaving the economy with side-effects such as inflation. For example, President John F. Kennedy proposed tax cuts in response to the high unemployment of 1960, but these were instituted only in 1964 and impacted the economy only in 1965 or 1966 and the increased debt encouraged inflation, reinforcing the effect of Vietnam war deficit spending.

==Structural and cyclical deficit==

Structural and cyclical deficits are two components of deficit spending. These terms are especially applied to public sector spending which contributes to the budget balance of the overall economy of a country. The total budget deficit, or headline deficit, is equal to the sum of the structural deficit and the cyclical deficit (or surplus/es).

===Cyclical deficit===
A cyclical (temporary) deficit is a deficit that is related to the business or economic cycle. The business cycle is the period of time it takes for an economy to move from expansion to contraction, until it begins to expand again. This cycle can last anywhere from several months to many years, and does not follow a predictable pattern.

The cyclical deficit is the deficit experienced at the low point of this cycle when there are lower levels of business activity and higher levels of unemployment. This leads to lower government revenues from taxation and higher government expenditure on things like social security, which may cause the economy to go into deficit. While the cyclical component is affected by government decisions, it is mainly influenced by national and international economic conditions which can be significantly beyond government control.

===Structural deficit===
A structural (permanent) deficit differs from a cyclical deficit in that it exists regardless of the point in the business cycle due to an underlying imbalance in government revenues and expenditures. Thus, even at the high point of the business cycle when revenues are high the country&#x27;s economy may still be in deficit.

The structural component of the budget is used by some economists as an indication of a government&#x27;s financial management, as it indicates the underlying balance between long-term government revenues and expenditure, while removing factors that are mainly attributable to the business cycle. Other economists see the structural deficit as simply a reflection of the implied discretionary fiscal stance of the government, that is, a structural deficit would be an expansionary fiscal stance that promotes at least nominal economic growth.

Where deficits are being funded by borrowing, a structural deficit is seen by some economists as an issue for a government as even at the high points of the business cycle the government may need to continue to borrow and thus continue to accumulate debt. According to them, this would lead to continued &quot;deterioration&quot; of the debt-to-GDP ratio, a basic measure of the health of an economy and an indication of the country&#x27;s ability to pay off its debts.

Other economists believe that provided the debt is issued in the country&#x27;s own currency, and provided that currency &#x27;floats&#x27; freely against other currencies, and provided the overall level of the deficit is not so large as to cause excessive inflation, then structural deficits are harmless. Those economists who believe that structural deficits need to be reduced argue that structural deficit issues can only be addressed by explicit and direct government policies, primarily involving reducing government spending or increasing taxation.

An alternative in countries which have fiat money is to address high levels of debt and a poor debt-to-GDP ratio by monetising the debt, essentially creating more money to be used to pay off the debt. Monetising the debt can lead to high levels of inflation, but with proper fiscal control this can be minimised or even avoided. Both it and the final option of defaulting on the debt are thought to be poor results for investors. There having been recent incidents involving quantitative easing in the UK, the U.S. and the Eurozone following the 2008 global financial crisis. These are the first instances of either since the dropping of the gold standard.

Structural deficits may be planned, or may be unintentional due to poor economic management or a fundamental lack of economic capacity in a country. In a planned structural deficit, the government may commit to spending money on the future of the country in order to improve the productive potential of the economy, for example investing in infrastructure, education, or transport, with the intention that this investment will yield long-term economic gains. If these investments work out as planned the structural deficit will be dealt with over the long-term due to the returns on investment. However, if expenditures continue to exceed revenues, the structural deficit will worsen.

A government may also knowingly plan the budget to be in deficit in order to sustain the country&#x27;s standard of living and continue its obligations to the citizens, although this would generally be an indication of poor economic management. Ongoing planned structural deficits may eventually lead to a crisis of confidence in investors regarding the country&#x27;s ability to pay the debt, as seen in the financial crises in a number of European countries since the late-2000s, especially the Greek and Spanish financial crises.

===Structural and cyclical surplus===
Structural and cyclical surpluses are the opposite of the deficits described above. With a &quot;cyclical surplus&quot;, at the high point of the business cycle government revenue will be expected to be higher and government expenditure lower, meaning revenue exceeds expenditure and the government experiences a surplus. Likewise, a &quot;structural surplus&quot; is when the government budget is fundamentally operating at a surplus regardless of its point in the business cycle.

===Interplay of structural and cyclical components===

The overall government budget balance is determined by the sum of the cyclical deficit or surplus and the structural deficit or surplus (refer to chart). Therefore, for example, a cyclical surplus could mask an underlying structural deficit, as the overall budget may appear to be in surplus if the cyclical surplus is greater than the structural deficit. In this case, as economic conditions deteriorated and the budget went into cyclical deficit, the structural and cyclical deficits would then compound leading to higher deficits and more dire economic conditions.

An example of this occurred in Australia during the later years of the Howard government. From 2009 Treasury attempted to separate cyclical and structural components of the budget balance, and first started publishing estimates of the structural component. Treasury showed that despite a run of large and often unexpected headline surpluses, the Australian economy was in fact in structural deficit from at least 2006–2007, and was deteriorating as far back as 2002–2003. At this time they determined that despite a headline surplus of A$17.2 billion in 2006–2007, there was an underlying structural deficit of around $3 billion, or 0.3% of GDP.

This structural deficit was caused by a mining boom leading to extremely high revenues and large surpluses for several consecutive years, which the Howard government then used to fuel spending and tax cuts, rather than saving or investing them to cover future cyclical downturns. With the Global Financial Crisis unexpectedly starting in 2007, revenues quickly and significantly declined and the underlying structural deficit was exposed and exacerbated, which then had to be dealt with by later governments. By 2008–2009 when the budget had a headline deficit of $32 billion, the structural deficit was out to around $50 billion. In 2013 it was estimated the structural deficit remained at about $40 billion, or 2.5% of GDP.

===Criticism===
Economist Chris Dillow has questioned the distinction between cyclical and structural deficits, and this has received support from other leading economists. He contends that there are too many variables involved to allow a clear distinction to be made, especially when dealing with current circumstances rather than retrospectively, and suggests that the concept of structural deficits may be used more for political purposes than analytical purposes. The piece largely centred on the UK Labour government 1997–2010 of which Chris Dillow was a strong supporter and criticism that they ran a large structural deficit. Economic representatives of that government acknowledge that, unbeknownst to them at the time, they were running a structural deficit. Economist and Professor Bill Mitchell has also questioned the misuse of the term &#x27;structural deficit&#x27;, particularly in the Australian context.

Martin Wolf argues that nobody knows what the structural or cyclically adjusted balance is, and that it is least knowable precisely when such knowledge is most essential, namely, when the economy is experiencing a boom. He provides two examples of widely divergent IMF estimates of the average structural fiscal balance of Ireland and Spain for the period 2000–2007. The estimates were made in 2008 and in 2012 and Wolf stresses that they were post-fact estimates and not predictions. Specifically, the IMF declared in 2008 that Ireland had run an average structural surplus of 1.3% of GDP per year between 2000 and 2007, and Spain had an average structural surplus of 0.5% of GDP per year over the same period. Four years later, the IMF decided that, for this same 8-year period, Ireland&#x27;s annual average structural balance was four percentage points worse than it had thought in April 2008, estimating that Ireland had been running an average structural fiscal deficit of 2.7% of GDP. For Spain, the 2012 IMF estimate differed by 1.7 percentage points, estimating this time that Spain had been running and average structural fiscal deficit of 1.2% of GDP in the years 2000–2007.

Bruce Yandle writing for &quot;Reason&quot;, stated in 2022 as a result of rising inflation that, &quot;[It would be prudent to] Blame Washington, Not Moscow, for Surging Inflation; Few politicians are willing to admit deficit spending is the larger cause.&quot;

<text>Max Immelmann (21 September 1890 – 18 June 1916) &quot;PLM&quot; was the first German World War I flying ace. He was a pioneer in fighter aviation and is often mistakenly credited with the first aerial victory using a synchronized gun, which was in fact achieved on 1 July 1915 by the German ace Kurt Wintgens. Immelmann was the first aviator to receive the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;, colloquially known as the &quot;Blue Max&quot; in his honour, being awarded it at the same time as Oswald Boelcke. His name has become attached to a common flying tactic, the Immelmann turn, and remains a byword in aviation. He is credited with 15 aerial victories.

Max Immelmann was born on 21 September 1890, in Dresden, to an industrialist father who died when Max was young. In 1905 he was enrolled in the Dresden Cadet School. He joined the &quot;Eisenbahnregiment (Railway Regiment) Nr. 2&quot; in 1911 as an ensign, in pursuit of a commission. 

He left the army in March 1912 to study mechanical engineering in Dresden. He returned to service at the outbreak of war in 1914, as a reserve officer candidate. Assigned to &quot;Eisenbahnregiment Nr. 1&quot;, he soon transferred to aviation.

== Wartime career ==

When World War I started, Immelmann was called to active service, transferred to the German Army&#x27;s air arm, &quot;Die Fliegertruppe des Deutschen Kaiserreiches&quot; (later known as the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot;) and was sent for pilot training at Johannisthal Air Field in November 1914. He was initially stationed in northern France.

Immelmann served as a pilot with &quot;Feldflieger Abteilung&quot; (Field Flier Detachment) 10 from February to April 1915, and then in &quot;FFA 62&quot; by early May 1915. On several occasions he engaged in combat while flying the L.V.G. two-seaters with which his units were equipped, but never with any success. On 3 June 1915, he was shot down by a French pilot, but managed to land safely behind German lines. Immelmann was decorated with the Iron Cross, Second Class, for preserving his aircraft.

Two very early examples of the Fokker Eindecker fighters were delivered to the unit, one Fokker M.5K/MG production prototype numbered &quot;E.3/15&quot; for Oswald Boelcke&#x27;s use, with Immelmann later in July receiving &quot;E.13/15&quot; as a production Fokker E.I for his own use before the end of July 1915. It was with the &quot;E.13/15&quot; aircraft, armed with the synchronized lMG 08 &quot;Spandau&quot; machine gun, that Immelmann gained his first &quot;confirmed&quot; air victory of the war on 1 August 1915, a fortnight after &quot;Leutnant&quot; Kurt Wintgens obtained the very first confirmed German aerial victory on 15 July 1915 with his own Fokker M.5K/MG production prototype &quot;E.5/15&quot; Eindecker, one of five built, following two unconfirmed ones on 1 and 4 July, all before Immelmann:
Lieutenant William Reid fought back valiantly, flying with his left hand and firing a pistol with his right. Nonetheless, the 450 bullets fired at him took their effect; Reid suffered four wounds in his left arm, and his airplane&#x27;s engine quit, causing a crash landing. The unarmed Immelmann landed nearby, and approached Reid; they shook hands and Immelmann said to the British pilot &quot;You are my prisoner&quot; and pulled Reid out of the wreckage and rendered first aid.

Immelmann became one of the first German fighter pilots, quickly building an impressive score of air victories. During September, three more victories followed, and then in October he became solely responsible for the air defense of the city of Lille. Immelmann became known as &quot;The Eagle of Lille&quot; (&quot;Der Adler von Lille&quot;).

Immelmann flirted with the position of Germany&#x27;s leading ace, trading that spot off with Oswald Boelcke, another pioneer ace. Having come second to Boelcke for his sixth victory, he was second to be awarded the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern for this feat. On 15 December, Immelmann shot down his seventh British plane and moved into an unchallenged lead in the competition to be Germany&#x27;s leading ace.

Immelmann was the first pilot to be awarded the &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot;, Germany&#x27;s highest military honour, receiving it on the day of his eighth win, 12 January 1916. The medal became unofficially known as the &quot;Blue Max&quot; in the German Air Service in honour of Immelmann. His medal was presented by Kaiser Wilhelm II on 12 January 1916. Oswald Boelcke received his medal at the same time.

Boelcke scored again two days later. Immelmann would chase him in the ace race for the next four months, drawing even on 13 March at 11 each, losing the lead on 19 March, regaining it on Easter Sunday (23 April) 14 to 13, losing it again forever on 1 May. It was about this time, on 25 April, that Immelmann received a salutary lesson in the improvement of British aircraft. As the German ace described his attack on two Airco DH.2s, &quot;The two worked splendidly together ... and put 11 shots into my machine. The petrol tank, the struts on the fuselage, the undercarriage and the propeller were hit ... It was not a nice business.&quot;

On 31 May, Immelmann, Max von Mulzer, and another German pilot attacked a formation of seven British aircraft. Immelmann was flying a two-gun Fokker E.IV, and when he opened fire, the synchronizing gear malfunctioned. A stream of bullets cut off the tip of a propeller blade. The thrashing of the unbalanced air screw nearly shook the aircraft&#x27;s twin-row Oberursel U.III engine loose from its mounts before he could cut the ignition and glide to a dead-stick landing.

==Death==
In the late afternoon of 18 June 1916, Immelmann led a flight of four Fokker E.III Eindeckers in search of a flight of eight F.E.2b fighter/reconnaissance aircraft of 25 Squadron Royal Flying Corps over Sallaumines in northern France. The British flight had just crossed the lines near Arras, with the intent of photographing the German infantry and artillery positions within the area, when Immelmann&#x27;s flight intercepted them. After a long-running fight, scattering the participants over an area of some , Immelmann brought down one of the enemy aircraft, wounding both the pilot and observer. This was his 16th victory claim, though it went unconfirmed.

At 21:45 that same evening, Immelmann in Fokker E.III, serial 246/16 encountered No. 25 Squadron again, this time near the village of Lens. Immediately, he got off a burst, which hit RFC Lt. J. R. B. Savage, pilot of F.E.2b pusher serial 4909, mortally wounding him. This was his 17th victory claim, though Max Mulzer was later credited with the victory. The second aircraft he closed on was piloted by Second Lieutenant G. R. McCubbin, with Corporal J. H. Waller as gunner/observer.

McCubbin was credited by the British with shooting Immelmann down. On the German side, many had seen Immelmann as invincible and could not conceive the notion that he had fallen to enemy fire. Meanwhile, British authorities awarded McCubbin the Distinguished Service Order and the Distinguished Service Medal and sergeant&#x27;s stripes for Waller.

The German Air Service at the time said the loss was due to friendly anti-aircraft fire. Others, including Immelmann&#x27;s brother, believed his aircraft&#x27;s gun synchronisation, designed to enable his machine gun to fire between the whirling propeller blades without damaging them, had malfunctioned with catastrophic results. Early versions of such gears frequently malfunctioned in this way and this had happened to Immelmann twice before, while testing two- and three-machine gun installations. On each occasion, he had been able to land safely. 

McCubbin, in a 1935 interview, said that immediately after Immelmann shot down McCubbin&#x27;s squadron-mate, the German ace began an Immelmann turn, McCubbin and Waller descended from a greater altitude and opened fire, shooting down Immelmann. Waller pointed out later that the British bullets could have hit Immelmann&#x27;s propeller.

Damage to the propeller resulting in the loss of one blade could have been the primary cause of the structural failure, evident in accounts of the crash of his aircraft. The resultant vibration of an engine at full throttle spinning half a propeller could have shaken the fragile craft to pieces. At 2,000 metres, the tail was seen to break away from the rest of Immelmann&#x27;s Fokker. The wings detached or folded, and what remained of the fuselage fell straight down. Immelmann’s body was recovered by the German 6 Armee from the twisted wreckage, lying lifeless over what was left of the surprisingly intact Oberursel engine, sometimes cited as under it. His body was identified by his initials embroidered on his handkerchief.

Immelmann was given a state funeral and buried in his home city of Dresden. His body was later exhumed and cremated in the Dresden-Tolkewitz Crematorium. Immelmann, along with Max Ritter von Mulzer, scored all of his victories flying different types of Eindeckers, becoming one of the most successful pilots in the type.

==Grave robbery and desecration==

During the night of Sunday 31 January 2021, Max Immelmann&#x27;s memorial grave in Tolkewitz was robbed and desecrated. The Pöppelmann grave figure &quot;Eagle of Lille&quot;, weighing around 100 kilograms, and approximately 180 centimetres in height, was dismantled and taken away by two men using a handcart to transport it to a pick-up truck parked nearby.

A local resident observed the robbery and informed the police, who are also investigating the two suspects in connection with other thefts. The public prosecutor&#x27;s office in Dresden, which brought charges against the alleged perpetrators, estimated the value of the grave figure at around 50,000 euros. After restoration the figure was returned to Immelmann&#x27;s grave.

A number of historically significant First World War artefacts have been stolen from the graves of soldiers in the Tolkewitz cemetery during 2021, with a suspicion of possible &quot;theft to order&quot;.

==Legacy==

The present-day Luftwaffe has dubbed Squadron AG-51 the &quot;Immelmann Squadron&quot; in his honour.

==Fokker Eindecker==

Immelmann will forever be associated with the Fokker Eindecker, Germany&#x27;s first fighter aircraft, and the first such aircraft to be armed with a machine gun synchronised to fire forward, through the propeller arc. Immelmann, along with Oswald Boelcke and other pilots, was one of the main exponents of the Fokker Eindecker, resulting in the Fokker Scourge which inflicted heavy losses upon British and French aircrews during 1915.

Initially, Immelmann shared the same &quot;E.3/15&quot; machine with Oswald Boelcke, but late in the summer of 1915 would receive his own machine, bearing the IdFlieg serial number &quot;E.13/15&quot; on its fuselage. Both these E.3/15 machine earlier shared with Boelcke, and his own E.13/15 aircraft, both used to secure Immelmann&#x27;s first five victories between them each had a seven-cylinder 80 horsepower Oberursel U.0 rotary engine for their power. According to Immelmann, the latter E.13/15 aircraft was retired and shipped off to Berlin for display at the Zeughaus Museum, in March 1916, but was wrecked in the first bombing raids of the Royal Air Force in 1940, during World War II.

==The Immelmann turn==

This refers to two quite different aerobatic maneuvers. The first of these is the one now known as an &quot;Immelmann&quot; (also frequently spelled&quot; &quot;Immelman&quot;,&quot; in literature and media).
# A half loop followed by a half roll on top, used to rapidly reverse the direction of flight. This maneuver may not have been practical in the primitive, underpowered fighters of 1915–1916, and its connection with the German fighter ace is doubtful.
# During World War I, an &quot;Immelmann turn&quot; was actually a sharp rudder turn off a vertical zoom climb (almost to a full stall) or modified chandelle followed by a steep dive. Immelmann may very well have originated this maneuver, or at least used it in combat, although this cannot be authenticated.

<text>Gary Mark Gilmore (born Faye Robert Coffman; December 4, 1940 – January 17, 1977) was an American criminal who gained international attention for demanding the implementation of his death sentence for two murders he had admitted to committing in Utah. After the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a new series of death penalty statutes in the 1976 decision &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot;, he became the first person in almost ten years to be executed in the United States. These new statutes avoided the problems under the 1972 decision in &quot;Furman v. Georgia,&quot; which had resulted in earlier death penalty statutes being deemed &quot;cruel and unusual&quot; punishment, and therefore unconstitutional (the Supreme Court had previously ordered all states to commute death sentences to life imprisonment after &quot;Furman&quot;). Gilmore was executed by a firing squad in 1977. His life and execution were the subject of the 1979 nonfiction novel &quot;The Executioner&#x27;s Song&quot;, by Norman Mailer, and the 1982 TV film of the novel starring Tommy Lee Jones as Gilmore.

==Early life==
Gary Mark Gilmore was born in McCamey, Texas, on December 4, 1940, the second of four sons, to Frank and Bessie Gilmore. The other sons were Frank Jr., Gaylen, and the writer and music journalist Mikal Gilmore. Frank Harry Gilmore (c. November 23, 1890, Lincoln, Nebraska – July 31, 1962, Seattle, Washington), an alcoholic con man, had other wives and families, none of whom he supported. On a whim, he married Bessie (née Brown) (August 19, 1913, Provo, Utah – June 29, 1981, Portland, Oregon), an outcast from Provo, Utah, in Sacramento, California. Gary was born while they were living in Texas under the pseudonym of Coffman to avoid the law. Frank christened his son Faye Robert Coffman, but once they left Texas, Bessie changed it to Gary Mark. This name change proved to be a sore point years later. Frank&#x27;s mother, Fay, kept the original &quot;Faye Coffman&quot; birth certificate, and when Gary found it two decades later, he assumed he must be either illegitimate or someone else&#x27;s son. He seized on this as the reason that he and his father never got along; he became very upset and walked out on his mother when she tried to explain the name change to him.

The theme of illegitimacy, real or imagined, was common in the Gilmore family. Frank Sr.&#x27;s mother, Fay Gilmore, once told Bessie that Frank Sr.&#x27;s father was a famous magician who had passed through Sacramento, where she was living. Bessie researched this at the library and concluded that Frank was the illegitimate son of Harry Houdini. Houdini was only sixteen years old in 1890, the year of Frank Gilmore&#x27;s birth, and did not begin his career as a magician until the following year. Whether Fay meant that Frank Sr.&#x27;s father was someone who would &quot;later become known&quot; as a famous magician is unknown. Mikal Gilmore, Gary&#x27;s youngest brother, believes the story to be false, but has stated that both his father and mother believed it. Gary&#x27;s oldest brother, Frank Jr, was the illegitimate son of Robert Ingram, who was Frank Sr&#x27;s son from an earlier marriage. Ingram had a brief affair with Bessie shortly after she had married his father. Frank Sr had believed Gary was the illegitimate son.

During Gary&#x27;s childhood, the family frequently relocated throughout the Western United States, with Frank supporting them by selling fake magazine subscriptions. Gary had a troubled relationship with his father, whom his youngest brother Mikal described as a &quot;cruel and unreasonable man.&quot; Frank Gilmore Sr. was strict and quick to anger, and would often whip his sons, Frank Jr., Gary, and Gaylen, with a razor strop, whip, or a belt for little or no reason. Less often, he would beat his wife. He mellowed somewhat with age: Mikal reported that Frank whipped him only once, and never did it again after Mikal told him, &quot;I hate you.&quot; In addition, Frank and Bessie would argue loudly and verbally abuse each other. Frank would anger Bessie by calling her crazy, and mock Brigham Young, the second president and prophet of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, with the pejorative &quot;Bring &#x27;em Young&quot;. Bessie would retaliate by calling him a &quot;Cat-licker&quot; [Catholic] and threatening to kill him some night. This abuse continued for years and caused considerable turmoil within the Gilmore family.

In 1952, the Gilmore family settled in Portland, Oregon. As an adolescent, Gary began engaging in petty crime. Although Gilmore had an IQ test score of 133, gained high scores on both aptitude and achievement tests, and showed artistic talent, he dropped out of high school in the ninth grade. He ran away from home with a friend to Texas, returning to Portland after several months.

==Crimes==
At the age of 14, Gary started a small car theft ring with friends, which resulted in his first arrest. He was released to his father with a warning. Two weeks later, he was back in court on another car theft charge. The court remanded him to the MacLaren Reform School for Boys in Woodburn, Oregon, from which he was released the following year. He was sent to Oregon State Correctional Institution on another car theft charge in 1960 and was released later that year.

In 1961, Frank Sr., Gary&#x27;s father, was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer; he died at the end of July 1962, while Gary was in Rocky Butte Jail in Portland, facing charges of driving without a license. A jail guard told Gary when his father died. Despite his dysfunctional relationship with his father, Gary was devastated and tried to kill himself by slitting his wrists. After his father died, Gilmore got into more and more trouble, as he became more erratic and was frequently drunk. He faced assault and armed robbery charges again in 1964 and was given a 15-year prison sentence as a habitual offender and sent to the Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem, Oregon. A prison psychiatrist diagnosed him with antisocial personality disorder with intermittent psychotic decompensation. He was granted conditional release in 1972 to live weekdays in a halfway house in Eugene, Oregon, and study art at a community college. Gilmore never registered and, within a month, he was arrested and convicted of armed robbery.

Due to his violent behavior in prison, Gilmore was transferred in 1975 from Oregon to the federal prison in Marion, Illinois, at the time a maximum security facility.

Gilmore was conditionally paroled in April 1976 and went to Provo, Utah, to live with a distant cousin, Brenda Nicol, who tried to help him find work. Gilmore worked briefly at his uncle Vern Damico&#x27;s shoe repair shop and then for an insulation company owned by Spencer McGrath, but he soon returned to his previous lifestyle of stealing, drinking, and fighting. Gilmore, then 35, had a relationship with Nicole Barrett Baker (later &quot;Nicole Barrett Henry&quot;), a 19-year-old who had been married twice before and had two young children. The relationship was at first casual, but soon became intense and strained due to Gilmore&#x27;s aggressive behavior and pressure from Baker&#x27;s family to prevent her from seeing him.

===Murders===
On the evening of July 19, 1976, Gilmore robbed and murdered Max Jensen, a gas station employee in Orem, Utah. The next evening, he robbed and murdered Bennie Bushnell, a motel manager in Provo. Although both men had complied with his demands, he murdered them. The young men were each ordered to lie down and then were shot in the head. Both were students at Brigham Young University; both left widows with infants. While disposing of the .22 caliber pistol used in both killings, Gilmore accidentally shot himself in his right hand, leaving a trail of blood to the service garage where he had left his truck to be repaired prior to murdering Bennie Bushnell. Garage mechanic Michael Simpson witnessed Gilmore hiding the gun in the bushes. Seeing the blood on Gilmore&#x27;s crudely bandaged right hand when he approached to pay for the repairs to his truck, and hearing on a police scanner of the shooting at the nearby motel, Simpson wrote down Gilmore&#x27;s license plate number and called the police. Gilmore&#x27;s cousin, Brenda, turned him in to police shortly after he phoned her asking for bandages and painkillers for the injury to his hand. The Utah State Police apprehended Gilmore as he tried to drive out of Provo, and he gave up without attempting to flee. Although he was charged with the murders of Jensen and Bushnell, the Jensen case was never brought to trial, apparently due to there being no eyewitnesses.

==Trial==
Gilmore&#x27;s murder trial began at the Provo courthouse on October 5, 1976, and lasted two days. Peter Arroyo, a motel guest, testified that he saw Gilmore in the motel registration office that night. After taking the money, Gilmore ordered Mr. Bushnell to lie down on the floor and then shot him. Gerald F. Wilkes, an FBI ballistics expert, matched the two shell casings and the bullet that killed Mr. Bushnell to the gun hidden in the bush, and a patrolman testified that he had traced Gilmore&#x27;s trail of blood to that same bush. Gilmore&#x27;s two court-appointed lawyers, Michael Esplin and Craig Snyder, made no attempt to cross-examine the majority of the state&#x27;s witnesses and rested without calling any witnesses for the defense. Gilmore protested and the following day asked the judge if he could take the stand in his own defense, perhaps arguing that due to the dissociation and lack of control he felt at the time, he had a good case for insanity. His attorneys presented the findings of four separate psychiatrists, all of whom had said that Gilmore was aware of what he was doing and that he knew it was wrong at the time. While he did have an antisocial personality disorder, which may have been aggravated by drinking and drugs, he did not meet the legal criteria for insanity. Gilmore withdrew his request. During closing statements, Esplin did mention that since Gilmore had accidentally shot himself, he might have accidentally killed Bushnell. Mentioning the lack of witnesses to the shooting, he asked the jury to find Gilmore guilty of second degree murder or even acquit him. On October 7, the jury retired to deliberate and by mid-day, they had returned with a guilty verdict for first degree murder. Later that day, the jury unanimously recommended a death sentence due to the special circumstances of the crime.

Gilmore chose to not pursue &quot;habeas corpus&quot; relief in federal court. His mother, Bessie, sued for a stay of execution on his behalf. In a five-to-four decision, the US Supreme Court refused to hear his mother&#x27;s claim. The court&#x27;s &quot;per curiam&quot; opinion said that the defendant had waived his rights by not pursuing them. At the time, Utah had two methods of execution—firing squad or hanging. Believing a hanging could be botched, Gilmore chose the former, declaring, &quot;I&#x27;d prefer to be shot.&quot; The execution was set for November 15 at 8:00 a.m.

Against his expressed wishes, Gilmore received several stays of execution through the efforts of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The last of these occurred just hours before the rescheduled execution date of January 17. That stay was overturned at 7:30 a.m., and the execution was allowed to proceed as planned. At a board of pardons hearing in November 1976, Gilmore said of the efforts by the ACLU and others to prevent his execution: &quot;They always want to get in on the act. I don&#x27;t think they have ever really done anything effective in their lives. I would like them all—including that group of reverends and rabbis from Salt Lake City—to butt out. This is my life and this is my death. It&#x27;s been sanctioned by the courts that I die and I accept that.&quot;

During the time Gilmore was on death row awaiting his execution, he attempted suicide twice; the first time on November 16 after the first stay was issued, and again one month later on December 16.

==Execution==
Gilmore was executed on January 17, 1977, at 8:07 a.m. by firing squad at the Utah State Prison in Draper, Utah.

On the morning of his execution, Gilmore was transported to an abandoned cannery behind the prison, which served as its death house. He was strapped to a chair, with a wall of sandbags placed behind him to trap the bullets. Five local police officers stood concealed behind a curtain with five small holes, through which they aimed their rifles. When asked for any last words, Gilmore simply replied, &quot;Let&#x27;s do it.&quot; The Rev. Thomas Meersman, the Catholic prison chaplain, administered the last rites to Gilmore. After the prison physician cloaked him in a black hood, Gilmore uttered his last words to Meersman: &quot;Dominus vobiscum&quot; (Latin, translation: &quot;The Lord be with you.&quot;) Meersman replied, &quot;Et cum spiritu tuo&quot; (&quot;And with your spirit.&quot;)

In Utah, firing squads consisted of five volunteer law enforcement officers from the county in which the conviction of the offender took place. The five executioners were equipped with .30-30-caliber rifles and off-the-shelf Winchester 150-grain (9.7 g) SilverTip ammunition. Gilmore was restrained and hooded, and the shots were fired at a distance of , aiming at the chest.

Prison officials stated that the firing squad comprised four men with live rounds, and one with a blank, so that the shooters could not be certain as to who fired the fatal shots. However, upon inspecting the clothes worn by his brother Gary at his execution, Mikal Gilmore noted five holes in the shirt. According to his memoir &quot;Shot in the Heart&quot;, &quot;the state of Utah, apparently, had taken no chances on the morning that it put my brother to death.&quot;

Gilmore had requested that some of his organs be donated for transplant purposes. Within hours of the execution, two people received his corneas. His body was sent for autopsy and was cremated later that day. The following day, his ashes were scattered from an airplane over Spanish Fork, Utah.

==Representation in the media==
As Gilmore was the first person in the United States executed since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976, his story had immense cultural resonance at the time.

Before his execution, the December 11, 1976, episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (Season 2, Episode 10) featured guest host Candice Bergen and the cast singing a Christmas-themed medley entitled &quot;Let&#x27;s Kill Gary Gilmore for Christmas.&quot; Dressed in winter attire and surrounded by fake snow, the performers sang the medley of familiar Christmas carols with altered lyrics. Lyrics set to &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot; included this line: &quot;In the meadow we can build a snowman / One with Gary Gilmore packed inside / We&#x27;ll ask him, &#x27;Are you dead yet?&#x27; He&#x27;ll say, &#x27;No, man&#x27; / But we&#x27;ll wait out the frostbite till he dies.&quot; A later episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live,&quot; on October 20, 1979, featured guest host Eric Idle performing impersonations while strapped to a stretcher, assisted by orderlies. With the stretcher standing on end, Idle covered his eyes with a black blindfold and announced it as an impersonation of Gary Gilmore.

The founder of advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy, Dan Wieden, credits the inspiration for his &quot;Just Do It&quot; Nike slogan to Gilmore&#x27;s last words.

Norman Mailer wrote a novel, &quot;The Executioner&#x27;s Song,&quot; based on Gilmore&#x27;s life; it won the Pulitzer Prize. Notable for its portrayal of Gilmore and the anguish surrounding the murders he committed, the book expressed Mailer&#x27;s thinking about the national debate over the revival of capital punishment.

Another writer to blend fact with fiction was Colombian writer Rafael Chaparro Madiedo, who featured Gilmore as one of the main characters of his 1992 novel &quot;Opio en las Nubes&quot; (&quot;Opium in the Clouds&quot;) which won the National Prize.

In 1982, &quot;The Executioner&#x27;s Song&quot; was adapted by Mailer for a television movie of the same name starring Tommy Lee Jones as Gilmore, and co-starring Christine Lahti, Eli Wallach, and Rosanna Arquette. Jones won an Emmy Award for his portrayal of Gilmore.

Artist Matthew Barney&#x27;s film &quot;Cremaster 2&quot; (1999), featured Gilmore as the main character, played by Barney; it was the second of five films in the series &quot;The Cremaster Cycle.&quot; At the beginning of &quot;Cremaster 3&quot;, a metamorphosed character corresponding to Gilmore is played by Nesrin Karanouh.

Gary&#x27;s brother Mikal Gilmore, an American writer and music journalist, wrote a memoir in 1994 entitled &quot;Shot in the Heart&quot;, detailing his relationship with Gary and their often troubled family, starting with the original Mormon settlers and continuing through to Gary&#x27;s execution and its aftermath. &quot;Shot in the Heart&quot; received positive reviews, including a comment by &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Michiko Kakutani calling the book &quot;Remarkable, astonishing... &quot;Shot in the Heart&quot; reads like a combination of Brothers Karamazov and a series of Johnny Cash ballads... chilling, heartbreaking, and alarming.&quot; In 1994 &quot;Shot in the Heart&quot; won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award. In 2001, &quot;Shot in the Heart&quot; became an HBO film starring Giovanni Ribisi as Mikal, Elias Koteas as Gary, Sam Shepard as the brothers&#x27; looming father, and Lee Tergesen as Frank Gilmore Jr. The 1977 punk rock single &quot;Gary Gilmore&#x27;s Eyes&quot; by the band the Adverts was used in the soundtrack of the movie. The song is written from &quot;the point of view of a hospital patient who has received the eyes of Gary Gilmore in a transplant.&quot; In 2003, American alternative rock band ArmsBendBack released a song titled &quot;Gary Gilmore&#x27;s Eyes&quot; as well.

Welsh playwright Dic Edwards dramatised Gilmore&#x27;s life in his 1995 play &quot;Utah Blue&quot;.

==Other references==
Many musicians have explored the Gilmore case. In 1977, the Adverts had a top 20 hit in the UK with the song &quot;Gary Gilmore&#x27;s Eyes&quot;. The lyrics describe an eye donor recipient realizing his new eyes came from the executed murderer. The song was later covered by German punk rock band Die Toten Hosen and a country version of the song was recorded by Dean Schlabowske. In 1978, Los Angeles punk band the Deadbeatz released a song called &quot;Let&#x27;s Shoot Maria&quot; which featured the chorus, &quot;Gonna finish off what Gary Gilmore started.&quot; In 1977, New York City experimental punk band Chain Gang released the song &quot;Gary Gilmore and the Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; as the B-side to their single &quot;Son of Sam&quot; about David Berkowitz. The Police&#x27;s song &quot;Bring on the Night&quot;, from their 1979 album &quot;Reggatta de Blanc&quot;, speculated on Gilmore&#x27;s possible feelings on the evening before his execution. In 1980 the Judy&#x27;s released the song &quot;How&#x27;s Gary?&quot; on their album &quot;Wonderful World of Appliances&quot;. The song presumably asks Gilmore&#x27;s mother what&#x27;s wrong with him, saying that he never comes out to play anymore. The song also inquires about the holes in his vest and why he is wearing a blindfold.

Several playwrights have integrated the Gilmore story into their work in one way or another. The Oakland-based performance artist Monte Cazazza sent out photos of himself in an electric chair on the day of the execution. One of these was mistakenly printed in a Hong Kong newspaper as the real execution. Cazazza was also photographed alongside COUM Transmissions/Throbbing Gristle members Genesis P-Orridge and Cosey Fanni Tutti for the &quot;Gary Gilmore Memorial Society&quot; postcard, in which the three artists posed blindfolded and tied to chairs with loaded guns pointed at them to depict Gilmore&#x27;s execution. In Christopher Durang&#x27;s play &quot;Beyond Therapy&quot; (1983), the character Bruce claims that he &quot;wanted to see Gary Gilmore executed on television.&quot;

<doc id="268508" wikidata="Q15077505" url="?curid=268508" title="Debt consolidation">
<text>Debt consolidation is a form of debt refinancing that entails taking out one loan to pay off many others. This commonly refers to a personal finance process of individuals addressing high consumer debt, but occasionally it can also refer to a country&#x27;s fiscal approach to consolidate corporate debt or government debt. The process can secure a lower overall interest rate to the entire debt load and provide the convenience of servicing only one loan or debt. Debt consolidation is sometimes offered by loan sharks, charging clients exorbitant interest rates. Further regulation has been discussed as a result.

==Overview==

Debt generally refers to money owed by one party, the debtor, to a second party, the creditor. It is generally subject to repayments of principal and interest. Interest is the fee charged by the creditor to the debtor, generally calculated as a percentage of the principal sum per year known as an interest rate and generally paid periodically at intervals, such as monthly. Debt can be secured with collateral or unsecured.

Although there is variation from country to country and even in regions within country, consumer debt is primarily made up of home loans, credit card debt and car loans. Household debt is the consumer debt of the adults in the household plus the mortgage, if applicable. In many countries, especially the United States and the United Kingdom, student loans can be a significant portion of debt but are usually regulated differently than other debt. The overall debt can reach the point where a debtor is in danger of bankruptcy, insolvency, or other fiscal emergency. Options available to overburdened debtors include credit counseling and personal bankruptcy.

Other consumer options include:
*debt settlement, where an individual&#x27;s debt is negotiated to a lesser interest rate or principal with the creditors to lessen the overall burden;
*debt relief, where part or whole of an individual debt is forgiven; and 
*debt consolidation, where the individual is able to acquit the current debts by taking out a new loan.
Sometimes the solution includes some of each of these tactics.

===Process===
The bulk of the consumer debt, especially that with a high interest, is repaid by a new loan. Most debt consolidation loans are offered from lending institutions and secured as a second mortgage or home equity line of credit. These require the individual to put up a home as collateral and the loan to be less than the equity available.

The overall lower interest rate is an advantage that debt consolidation loan offers to consumers. Lenders have fixed costs to process payments and repayment can spread out over a larger period. However, such consolidation loans have costs: fees, interest, and &quot;points&quot; where one point equals to one percent of the amount borrowed. In some countries, these loans may provide certain tax advantages. Because they are secured, a lender can attempt to seize property if the borrower goes into default.

Personal loans comprise another form of debt consolidation loan. Individuals can issue debtors a personal loan that satisfies the outstanding debt and creates a new one on their own terms. These loans, often unsecured, are based on the personal relationship rather than collateral.

In United States, there are certain companies and private law firms addressed as debt relief companies and/or debt consolidation companies that provide professional debt consolidation services. A consumer can approach them for debt help and make only one monthly payment to them. This payment will then be disbursed by these companies among the various creditors the consumer is indebted to.
Many other countries, alongside the United States, also have such professional services for the benefit of consumers struggling with household debt. 

==Student loan consolidation==
In the United States, student loans which are part of the Federal Direct Student Loan Program are consolidated somewhat differently from in the UK, as federal student loans are guaranteed by the U.S. government.

===United States===
In a federal student loan consolidation, a weighted average interest rate is assigned to the consolidation loan, rounded up to the nearest eighth. Federal student loan consolidation is sometimes incorrectly referred to as refinancing. Unlike some private sector debt consolidation, student loan consolidation does not incur any fees for the borrower.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK student loan entitlements are guaranteed, and are recovered using a means-tested system from the student&#x27;s future income. Student loans in the UK can not be included in bankruptcy, but do not affect a person&#x27;s credit rating because the repayments are deducted from salary at source by employers, similar to income tax and National Insurance contributions. Many students, however, struggle with commercial debt well after their courses have finished.

===Australia===
Australia&#x27;s student loan system once allowed 35 years to pay back loans, but currently allows 15. Those seriously delinquent on student loans face arrest at the border.

===Japan===
In Japan, an increasing number of student loans are in arrears. In response, the nation is taking harsher steps when it comes to lending determinations. In an effort to prevent future defaults, Japan has begun associating loan approvals to academic performance.

<text>Public finance refers to the monetary resources available to governments and also to the study of finance within government and role of the government in the economy. Within academic settings, public finance is a widely studied subject in many branches of political science, political economy and public economics. Research assesses the government revenue and government expenditure of the public authorities and the adjustment of one or the other to achieve desirable effects and avoid undesirable ones. The purview of public finance is considered to be threefold, consisting of governmental effects on:
# The efficient allocation of available resources;
# The distribution of income among citizens; and
# The stability of the economy.

American public policy advisor and economist Jonathan Gruber put forth a framework to assess the broad field of public finance in 2010: 
# When should the government intervene in the economy? To which there are two central motivations for government intervention, market failure and redistribution of income and wealth.
# How might the government intervene? Once the decision is made to intervene the government must choose the specific tool or policy choice to carry out the intervention (for example public provision, taxation, or subsidization). 
# What is the effect of those interventions on economic outcomes? A question to assess the empirical direct and indirect effects of specific government intervention. 
# And finally, why do governments choose to intervene in the way that they do? This question is centrally concerned with the study of political economy, theorizing how governments make public policy.

== Overview ==
One of the more traditional subfields of economics, public finance emphasizes the function and role of government in the economy. A region&#x27;s inhabitants established a formal or informal entity known as the government to carry out a variety of tasks, including providing for social requirements like education and healthcare as well as protecting the populace&#x27;s private property from outside threats.
The proper role of government provides a starting point for the analysis of public finance. In theory, under certain circumstances, private markets will allocate goods and services among individuals efficiently (in the sense that no waste occurs and that individual tastes are matching with the economy&#x27;s productive abilities). If private markets were able to provide efficient outcomes and if the distribution of income were socially acceptable, then there would be little or no scope for government. In many cases, however, conditions for private market efficiency are violated. For example, if many people can enjoy the same good (the moment that good was produced and sold, it starts to give its utility to every one for free) at the same time (non-rival, non-excludable consumption), then private markets may supply too little of that good. National defense is one example of non-rival consumption, or of a public good.

&quot;Market failure&quot; occurs when private markets do not allocate goods or services efficiently. The existence of market failure provides an efficiency-based rationale for collective or governmental provision of goods and services. Externalities, public goods, informational advantages, strong economies of scale, and network effects can cause market failures. Public provision via a government or a voluntary association, however, is subject to other inefficiencies, termed &quot;government failure.&quot;

Under broad assumptions, government decisions about the efficient scope and level of activities can be efficiently separated from decisions about the design of taxation systems (Diamond-Mirrlees separation). In this view, public sector programs should be designed to maximize social benefits minus costs (cost-benefit analysis), and then revenues needed to pay for those expenditures should be raised through a taxation system that creates the fewest efficiency losses caused by distortion of economic activity as possible. In practice, government budgeting or public budgeting is substantially more complicated and often results in inefficient practices. 
Government can pay for spending by borrowing (for example, with government bonds), although borrowing is a method of distributing tax burdens through time rather than a replacement for taxes. A deficit is the difference between government spending and revenues. The accumulation of deficits over time is the total public debt. Deficit finance allows governments to smooth tax burdens over time and gives governments an important fiscal policy tool. Deficits can also narrow the options of successor governments. There is also a difference between public and private finance, in public finance the source of income is indirect, e.g., various taxes (specific taxes, value added taxes), but in private finance sources of income is direct.

== History ==
Although public finance only began to be viewed as a body of knowledge no more than a century and a half ago, there is evidence of principles common to public finance as early as the bible with discussions of Sunday-trade, slavery regulations, and compassion for the poor. Public finance, although not explicitly named, is often the subject of much of political philosophy.

These concepts can be seen in ancient greece as well, although it was split into two categories there: on one hand the government was to provide for a theater in every city and works of art in the country side. On the other hand, the government was to provide financing for war. Unemployment in ancient Greece was virtually non-existent as Greek economic rule equated heavily to slavery. Greek economic development as per the governmental duties extended to growth, equity, and employment.

The Romans later popularized systemic bodies of law. They guaranteed freedom of contract and property, as well as reasonable price and value. They also developed a well-maintained system of roads and colonies which led to one of the first real tax systems. Their system was tbased on two types of taxes: tributa and vectigalia. The former included the land tax and a poll tax, while the latter was made up of another poll tax, an inheritance tax, a sales tax, and a postage tax. Other taxes depended entirely on the city and were usually temporary. These taxes were used among other things to fund the military, establish trade routes, and fund the cursus publicum. Each region had a set amount to pay which would be collected by aristocrats. Who paid taxes was determined by local officials. The Romans employed a regressive tax system wherein the lower income levels paid higher taxes and the wealthier enjoyed reduced taxation.

During feudalism lacking communication led to issues with pre-existing tax systems. Taxation was organized based on what &quot;men spend&quot; in hopes of encouraging investment and savings. Since the government was meant to take care of those who would otherwise turn to charity or crime by means of an allowance provided by a public tax, it is one of the first concepts of what could be considered a negative income tax. Additionally, in England at the time, the main taxes paid were land taxes, a tax that was collected in order to pay for mercenaries. The first mention of a tax in Anglo-Saxon England dates back to the 7th century where it&#x27;s specified that fines resulting from judicial cases should be paid to the king. Later something known as food rent was introduced, wherein regions would pay a certain amount of their foodstuffs to the king periodically.

This food rent was not too dissimilar from the taxes imposed on serfs in Russia in the Middle Ages wherein they were to pay most of their produce and goods to the local lord. In 1550 serfs were instructed to pay another tax called za povoz, which was imposed on those who refused to deliver the harvest from their fields to their master. Later in the eighteenth and nineteenth century lords began having to pay a per capita tax for each of their peasants and were responsible for their well-being during times of famine.

Toward this time, public finance and interest in how governments were to utilize the money earned from taxes as well as how to provide for their state became increasingly common.

The laissez-faire approach first became popular toward the middle of the 17th century, popularized especially by Charles Davenant. The laissez-faire attitude was especially common with Physiocrats in France (as opposed to the classical school in Britain). They maintained a &quot;laissez-faire, laisser-passer&quot; attitude, with one of the central ideas being that the government&#x27;s central role should be to guarantee private property, and the maintenance of one single tax, namely the &quot;produit net&quot;, which encompassed the farmer&#x27;s surplus.

Adam Smith also advocated for the laissez-faire attitude, but also claimed that the government would need to take a more proactive role in protection, justice, and public works. He first proposed the idea of a public good, as he believed that a good could provide a value to society as whole that would exceed the value it would provide to only one individual. Adam Smith also maintained that a government should maintain a properly regulated money flow and banking system, patents as well as copyrights,  and provide public education and transport. For him public projects always needed to yield a profit that would be greater to society than the individual. One of the most pivotal works on taxation, Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;Canons of Taxation&quot; gave further criteria for taxation, namely equality, certainty, convenience, and economy.

Following Adam Smith, several economists expanded on his ideas, or transformed them as in the case of Thomas Robert Malthus, who believed that tax-financed public works would be most effective, so long as it created greater demand for labor and commodities.

Public finance as a field began becoming more well-known and independently recognized around this time, with John Ramsay McCulloch writing many pivotal works in the field.

==Public finance management==
Collection of sufficient resources from the economy in an appropriate manner along with allocating and use of these resources efficiently and effectively constitute good financial management. Resource generation, resource allocation, and expenditure management (resource utilization) are the essential components of a public financial management system.

The following subdivisions form the subject matter of public finance.

# Public expenditure
# Public revenue
# Public debt
# Financial administration
# Federal finance
# Fiscal policy

==Government expenditures==

Economists classify government expenditures into three main types. Government purchases of goods and services for current use are classed as government consumption. Government purchases of goods and services intended to create future benefits – such as infrastructure investment or research spending – are classed as government investment. Government expenditures that are not purchases of goods and services, and instead just represent transfers of money – such as social security payments – are called transfer payments.

===Government operations===

Government operations are those activities involved in the running of a state or a functional equivalent of a state (for example, tribes, secessionist movements or revolutionary movements) for the purpose of producing value for the citizens. Government operations have the power to make, and the authority to enforce rules and laws within a civil, corporate, religious, academic, or other organization or group.

===Income distribution===
* Income distribution – Some forms of government expenditure are specifically intended to transfer income from some groups to others. For example, governments sometimes transfer income to people that have suffered a loss due to natural disaster. Likewise, public pension programs transfer wealth from the young to the old. Other forms of government expenditure that represent purchases of goods and services also have the effect of changing the income distribution. For example, engaging in a war may transfer wealth to certain sectors of society. Public education transfers wealth to families with children in these schools. Public road construction transfers wealth from people that do not use the roads to those people that do (and to those that build the roads).
* Income Security
* Employment insurance
* Health Care
* Public financing of campaigns

==Financing of government expenditures==
Government expenditures are financed primarily in three ways:
* Government revenue
** Taxes
** Non-tax revenue (revenue from government-owned corporations, sovereign wealth funds, sales of assets, or seigniorage)
* Government borrowing
* Money creation

How a government chooses to finance its activities can have important effects on the distribution of income and wealth (income redistribution) and on the efficiency of markets (effect of taxes on market prices and efficiency). The issue of how taxes affect income distribution is closely related to tax incidence, which examines the distribution of tax burdens after market adjustments are taken into account. Public finance research also analyzes effects of the various types of taxes and types of borrowing as well as administrative concerns, such as tax enforcement.

===Taxes===

Taxation is the central part of modern public finance. Its significance arises not only from the fact that it is by far the most important of all revenues but also because of the gravity of the problems created by the present day tax burden. The main objective of taxation is raising revenue. A high level of taxation is necessary in a welfare State to fulfill its obligations. Taxation is used as an instrument of attaining certain social objectives, i.e., as a means of redistribution of wealth and thereby reducing inequalities. Taxation in a modern government is thus needed not merely to raise the revenue required to meet its expenditure on administration and social services, but also to reduce the inequalities of income and wealth. Taxation might also be needed to draw away money that would otherwise go into consumption and cause inflation to rise.

A tax is a financial charge or other levy imposed on an individual or a legal entity by a state or a functional equivalent of a state (for example, tribes, secessionist movements or revolutionary movements). Taxes could also be imposed by a subnational entity. Taxes consist of direct tax or indirect tax, and may be paid in money or as &quot;corvée&quot; labor. A tax may be defined as a &quot;pecuniary burden laid upon individuals or property to support the government [ . . .] a payment exacted by legislative authority.&quot; A tax &quot;is not a voluntary payment or donation, but an enforced contribution, exacted pursuant to legislative authority&quot; and is &quot;any contribution imposed by government [ . . .] whether under the name of toll, tribute, tallage, gabel, impost, duty, custom, excise, subsidy, aid, supply, or other name.&quot;
* There are various types of taxes, broadly divided into two heads – direct (which is proportional) and indirect tax (which is differential in nature):
* Stamp duty, levied on documents
* Excise tax (tax levied on production for sale, or sale, of a certain good)
* Sales tax (tax on business transactions, especially the sale of goods and services)
** Value added tax (VAT) is a type of sales tax
** Services taxes on specific services
* Road tax; Vehicle excise duty (UK), Registration Fee (US), Regco (Australia), Vehicle Licensing Fee (Brazil) etc.
* Gift tax
* Duties (taxes on importation, levied at customs)
* Corporate income tax on corporations (incorporated entities)
* Wealth tax
* Personal income tax (may be levied on individuals, families such as the Hindu joint family in India, unincorporated associations, etc.)

===Debt===

Governments, like any other legal entity, can take out loans, issue bonds, and make financial investments. Government debt (also known as public debt or national debt) is money (or credit) owed by any level of government; either central or federal government, municipal government, or local government. Some local governments issue bonds based on their taxing authority, such as tax increment bonds or revenue bonds.

As the government represents the people, government debt can be seen as an indirect debt of the taxpayers. Government debt can be categorized as internal debt, owed to lenders within the country, and external debt, owed to foreign lenders. Governments usually borrow by issuing securities such as government bonds and bills. Less creditworthy countries sometimes borrow directly from commercial banks or international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank.

Most government budgets are calculated on a cash basis, meaning that revenues are recognized when collected and outlays are recognized when paid. Some consider all government liabilities, including future pension payments and payments for goods and services the government has contracted for but not yet paid, as government debt. This approach is called accrual accounting, meaning that obligations are recognized when they are acquired, or accrued, rather than when they are paid. This constitutes public debt.

===Seigniorage===

Seigniorage is the net revenue derived from the issuing of currency. It arises from the difference between the face value of a coin or banknote and the cost of producing, distributing and eventually retiring it from circulation. Seigniorage is an important source of revenue for some national banks, although it provides a very small proportion of revenue for advanced industrial countries.

===Public finance through state enterprise===
Public finance in centrally planned economies has differed in fundamental ways from that in market economies. Some state-owned enterprises generated profits that helped finance government activities.. In various mixed economies, the revenue generated by state-owned enterprises is used for various state endeavors; typically the revenue generated by state and government agencies.

==Government finance statistics and methodology==
Macroeconomic data to support public finance economics are generally referred to as fiscal or government finance statistics (GFS). &quot;The Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001)&quot; is the internationally accepted methodology for compiling fiscal data. It is consistent with regionally accepted methodologies such as the &quot;European System of Accounts 1995&quot; and consistent with the methodology of the &quot;System of National Accounts (SNA1993)&quot; and broadly in line with its most recent update, the &quot;SNA2008&quot;.

=== Measuring the public sector ===
The size of governments, their institutional composition and complexity, their ability to carry out large and sophisticated operations, and their impact on the other sectors of the economy warrant a well-articulated system to measure government economic operations.

The &quot;GFSM 2001&quot; addresses the institutional complexity of government by defining various levels of government. The main focus of the &quot;GFSM 2001&quot; is the general government sector defined as the group of entities capable of implementing public policy through the provision of primarily non market goods and services and the redistribution of income and wealth, with both activities supported mainly by compulsory levies on other sectors. The &quot;GFSM 2001&quot; disaggregates the general government into subsectors: central government, state government, and local government (See Figure 1). The concept of general government does not include public corporations. The general government plus the public corporations comprise the public sector (See Figure 2).

The general government sector of a nation includes all non-private sector institutions, organisations and activities. The general government sector, by convention, includes all the public corporations that are not able to cover at least 50% of their costs by sales, and, therefore, are considered non-market producers.

In the European System of Accounts, the sector &quot;general government&quot; has been defined as containing:
* &quot;All institutional units which are other non-market producers whose output is intended for individual and collective consumption, and mainly financed by compulsory payments made by units belonging to other sectors, and/or all institutional units principally engaged in the redistribution of national income and wealth&quot;.

Therefore, the main functions of general government units are :
* to organize or redirect the flows of money, goods and services, or other assets among corporations, among households, and between corporations and households; in the purpose of social justice, increased efficiency or other aims legitimized by the citizens—examples are the redistribution of national income and wealth, the corporate income tax paid by companies to finance unemployment benefits, the social contributions paid by employees to finance the pension systems;
* to produce goods and services to satisfy households&#x27; needs (e.g., state health care) or to collectively meet the needs of the whole community (e.g. defense, public order, and safety).

The general government sector, in the European System of Accounts, has four sub-sectors:

# central government
# state government
# local government
# social security funds

&quot;Central government&quot; consists of all administrative departments of the state and other central agencies whose responsibilities cover the whole economic territory of a country, except for the administration of social security funds.

&quot;State government&quot; is defined as the separate institutional units that exercise some government functions below those units at central government level and above those units at local government level, excluding the administration of social security funds.

&quot;Local government&quot; consists of all types of public administration whose responsibility covers only a local part of the economic territory, apart from local agencies of social security funds.

&quot;Social security fund&quot; is a central, state or local institutional unit whose main activity is to provide social benefits. It fulfils the two following criteria:
* by law or regulation (except those about government employees), certain population groups must take part in the scheme and have to pay contributions;
* general government is responsible for the management of the institutional unit, for the payment or approval of the level of the contributions and of the benefits, independent of its role as a supervisory body or employer.

The &quot;GFSM 2001&quot; framework is similar to the financial accounting of businesses. For example, it recommends that governments produce a full set of financial statements including the statement of government operations (akin to the income statement), the balance sheet, and a cash flow statement. Two other similarities between the GFSM 2001 and business financial accounting are the recommended use of accrual accounting as the basis of recording and the presentations of stocks of assets and liabilities at market value. It is an improvement on the prior methodology – &quot;Government Finance Statistics Manual 1986&quot; – based on cash flows and without a balance sheet statement.

=== Users of GFS ===
The &quot;GFSM 2001&quot; recommends standard tables including standard fiscal indicators that meet a broad group of users including policy makers, researchers, and investors in sovereign debt.
Government finance statistics should offer data for topics such as the fiscal architecture, the measurement of the efficiency and effectiveness of government expenditures, the economics of taxation, and the structure of public financing. The &quot;GFSM 2001&quot; provides a blueprint for the compilation, recording, and presentation of revenues, expenditures, stocks of assets, and stocks of liabilities. The &quot;GFSM 2001&quot; also defines some indicators of effectiveness in government&#x27;s expenditures, for example the compensation of employees as a percentage of expense. The &quot;GFSM 2001&quot; includes a functional classification of expense as defined by the Classification of Functions of Government (COFOG) .

This functional classification allows policy makers to analyze expenditures on categories such as health, education, social protection, and environmental protection.
The financial statements can provide investors with the necessary information to assess the capacity of a government to service and repay its debt, a key element determining sovereign risk, and risk premia. Like the risk of default of a private corporation, sovereign risk is a function of the level of debt, its ratio to liquid assets, revenues and expenditures, the expected growth and volatility of these revenues and expenditures, and the cost of servicing the debt. The government&#x27;s financial statements contain the relevant information for this analysis.

The government&#x27;s balance sheet presents the level of the debt; that is the government&#x27;s liabilities. The memorandum items of the balance sheet provide additional information on the debt including its maturity and whether it is owed to domestic or external residents. The balance sheet also presents a disaggregated classification of financial and non-financial assets.

These data help estimate the resources a government can potentially access to repay its debt. The statement of operations (&quot;income statement&quot;) contains the revenue and expense accounts of the government. The revenue accounts are divided into subaccounts, including the different types of taxes, social contributions, dividends from the public sector, and royalties from natural resources. Finally, the interest expense account is one of the necessary inputs to estimate the cost of servicing the debt.

=== Fiscal data using the &quot;GFSM 2001&quot; methodology ===
GFS can be accessible through several sources. The International Monetary Fund publishes GFS in two publications: &quot;International Financial Statistics&quot; and the &quot;Government Finance Statistics Yearbook&quot;. The World Bank gathers information on external debt. On a regional level, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (Dibidami ) compiles general government account data for its members, and Eurostat, following a methodology compatible with the GFSM 2001, compiles GFS for the members of the European Union.

== Public finance and social equality ==
Social equality is the equivalent treatment of and opportunity for members of different groups within society regardless of individual distinctions of race, ethnicity, gender, age, social class, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, or other characteristics or circumstances.

Social fairness includes the equal access of the various groups forming society to the financial resources and opportunities in all areas. This concept is ensuring that every individual, despite their socioeconomic condition, race, gender, and other qualities, get equal opportunities to benefit from public services that relate to health, education, and social welfare.

=== Principles of social equality in public finance ===
The core tenets of promoting social equality through public finance include:

* Equitable taxation: The taxing system is set to be equitable and not to burden the poor while providing enough revenue to fund the government expenditures. Mostly, this will involve progressive taxations in which higher earners pay a higher rate.
* Uniform resource distribution: It ensures that public services across regions are of high quality and equal, including those from the less wealthy areas. This approach helps to mitigate regional disparities in access to government services.
* Universal access to services: These policies are put in place to make sure that all citizens have access to some of the essential public services. For example, among the services ensuring the well-being and economic productivity of people are primary education, healthcare, and public safety.
* Anti-discrimination measures: To enforce policies meant for the prevention of discrimination in the distribution of services and employment within the government sector. That is necessary in a society where people have an equal chance to succeed.

=== Implementation strategies ===
To achieve social equality, governments employ a variety of strategies, including:

* Policy evaluation and adjustment: Evaluation of the influence behind fiscal policies on the different demographic groups. Implemented to guarantee that said policies are effective.
* Public engagement: In this way, the process includes diverse community stakeholders to ensure they contribute and their needs are also addressed in the policies.
* Legislative reforms: Laws that support equitable access to resources and protect against discrimination in public service delivery.

=== Challenges and considerations ===
The challenges of a political nature and budget constraints are among many, which could prevent integration of social equality into public finance. There has to be constant review and fine-tuning of the policies with full commitment to fairness in the distribution of public finance.

These principles and strategies might very well make public finance one of the strongest allies for social equality—one where everyone has, under any circumstance, fair chances for success and participation in the benefits provided by society.

== Public finance and social equity ==
Social equity is the fair, just and equitable management of all institutions serving the public directly or by contract; and the fair and equitable distribution of public services, and implementation of public policy; and the commitment to promote fairness, justice and equity in the formation of public policy.

Social equity in public finance underlies the principles and practices that work toward fair distribution of public resources, especially geared towards reducing inequalities between different social groups. This idea is very relevant for designing and implementing public policies, notably towards issues such as taxation, budget allocations, and public spending.

=== Concepts and implementation ===
Social equity requires formulating fiscal policies that are not only fair but also inclusive across all groups of society. In more cases than not, this calls for a progressive tax system, where people of higher income bring in a higher percentage of their incomes, which helps in redistributing the resources toward communities that are under-served.

This underpins the importance for local governments to consider social equity in their strategic planning and budgeting process. This achieved through techniques such as the &quot;veil of ignorance,&quot; which would be applied to make sure that policy makers design systems without any bias based on their personal characteristics, such as race, income, or place of residence. Under this experiment, decision-makers would ideally create systems that they would deem fair regardless of their status in society.

=== Focus areas ===
In practice, successful involvement of social equity in public finance often requires a focus on specific demographic groups most affected by disparities, such as those differentiated by race, socio-economic status, or geographic location. Local governments may, in this way, bring equity by being able to customize public services and even distribution of resources to those groups, effectively dealing with the systemic inequalities.

Achieving social equity is challenged by limited resources, political resistance, and economic disparities, respectively. Overcoming them calls for transparent policymaking, antidiscrimination laws, and region-specific policies. Success, on the other hand, calls for involvement from the stakeholders and effective governance that takes into account long-term planning and sustainability.

=== Measuring Social Equity ===
Clear goals have to be set with regard to measuring social equity and also relevant metrics. Common measures include accessibility to quality education, health outcomes from healthcare, and walkability of neighborhoods. Local governments can measure through such indicators the efficiency of their efforts and performance in the allocation of resources from the budget to take care of the social disparities.

In so doing, public finance may appear as a very strong lever that guarantees social equity based on the ability of all members of the community to gain respective fair access to the opportunities required for their well-being and success.

<text>The Incoterms or International Commercial Terms are a series of pre-defined commercial terms published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) relating to international commercial law. Incoterms define the responsibilities of exporters and importers in the arrangement of shipments and the transfer of liability involved at various stages of the transaction. They are widely used in international commercial transactions or procurement processes and their use is encouraged by trade councils, courts and international lawyers. A series of three-letter trade terms related to common contractual sales practices, the Incoterms rules are intended primarily to clearly communicate the tasks, costs, and risks associated with the global or international transportation and delivery of goods. Incoterms inform sales contracts defining respective obligations, costs, and risks involved in the delivery of goods from the seller to the buyer, but they do not themselves conclude a contract, determine the price payable, currency or credit terms, govern contract law or define where title to goods transfers.

The Incoterms rules are accepted by governments, legal authorities, and practitioners worldwide for the interpretation of most commonly used terms in international trade. They are intended to reduce or remove altogether uncertainties arising from the differing interpretations of the rules in different countries. As such they are regularly incorporated into sales contracts worldwide.

&quot;Incoterms&quot; is a registered trademark of the ICC.

CISG art. 66 is a supplement to an inadequate Incoterms rule.

The first work published by the ICC on international trade terms was issued in 1923, with the first edition known as Incoterms published in 1936. The Incoterms rules were amended in 1953, 1967, 1976, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010, with the ninth version — Incoterms 2020 — having been published on September 10, 2019.

==Incoterms 2020==

&quot;Incoterms 2020&quot; is the ninth set of international contract terms published by the International Chamber of Commerce, with the first set having been published in 1936. &quot;Incoterms 2020&quot; defines 11 rules, the same number as defined by &quot;Incoterms 2010&quot;. One rule of the 2010 version (&quot;Delivered at Terminal&quot;; DAT) was removed, and is replaced by a new rule (&quot;Delivered at Place Unloaded&quot;; DPU) in the 2020 rules.

The insurance to be provided under terms CIF and CIP has also changed, increasing from Institute Cargo Clauses(C) to Institute Cargo Clauses(A). Under the CIF Incoterms rule, which is reserved for use in maritime trade and is often used in commodity trading, the Institute Cargo Clauses (C) remains the default level of coverage, giving parties the option to agree to a higher level of insurance cover. Taking into account feedback from global users, the CIP Incoterms rule now requires a higher level of cover, compliant with the Institute Cargo Clauses (A) or similar clauses.

In prior versions, the rules were divided into four categories, but the 11 pre-defined terms of &quot;Incoterms 2020&quot; are subdivided into two categories &quot;based only on method of delivery&quot;. The larger group of seven rules may be used regardless of the method of transport, with the smaller group of four being applicable only to sales that solely involve transportation by water where the condition of the goods can be verified at the point of loading on board ship. They are therefore not to be used for containerized freight, other combined transport methods, or for transport by road, air or rail.

Incoterms 2020 also formally defines delivery. Previously, the term had been defined informally but it is now defined as the point in the transaction where &quot;the risk of loss or damage [to the goods] passes from the seller to the buyer&quot;.

==Incoterms in government regulations==
In some jurisdictions, the duty costs of the goods may be calculated against a specific Incoterm: for example in India, duty is calculated against the CIF value of the goods, and in South Africa the duty is calculated against the FOB value of the goods. Because of this it is common for contracts for exports to these countries to use these Incoterms, even when they are not suitable for the chosen mode of transport. If this is the case then great care must be exercised to ensure that the points at which costs and risks pass are clarified with the customer.

==Defined terms in Incoterms==
There are certain terms that have special meaning within Incoterms, and some of the more important ones are defined below:
* Delivery: The point in the transaction where the risk of loss or damage to the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer 
* Arrival: The point named in the Incoterm to which carriage has been paid
* Free: Seller has an obligation to deliver the goods to a named place for transfer to a carrier
* Carrier: Any person who, in a contract of carriage, undertakes to perform or to procure the performance of transport by rail, road, air, sea, inland waterway or by a combination of such modes
* Freight forwarder: A firm that makes or assists in the making of shipping arrangements;
* Terminal: Any place, whether covered or not, such as a dock, warehouse, container yard or road, rail or air cargo terminal
* To clear for export: To file Shipper’s Export Declaration and get export permit

==Variation of Incoterms==
Parties adopting Incoterms should be wary about their intention and variations. The desire of the parties should be expressed clearly and casual adoption should be refrained. Also, making additions or variations to the meaning of a certain term should be carefully done as parties&#x27; failure to use any trade term at all can produce unexpected results.

==Rules for any mode of transport==

===EXW – Ex Works (named place of delivery)===
The seller makes the goods available at their premises, or at another named place. This term places the maximum obligation on the buyer and minimum obligations on the seller. The Ex Works term is often used while making an initial quotation for the sale of goods without any costs included.

EXW means that a buyer incurs the risks of bringing the goods to their final destination. Either the seller does not load the goods on collecting vehicles and does not clear them for export, or if the seller does load the goods, they do so at buyer&#x27;s risk and cost. If the parties agree that the seller should be responsible for the loading of the goods on departure and to bear the risk and all costs of such loading, this must be made clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in the contract of sale.

There is no obligation for the seller to make a contract of carriage, but there is also no obligation for the buyer to arrange one either - the buyer may sell the goods on to their own customer for collection from the original seller&#x27;s warehouse. However, in common practice the buyer arranges the collection of the freight from the designated location, and is responsible for clearing the goods through Customs. The buyer is also responsible for completing all the export documentation, although the seller does have an obligation to obtain information and documents at the buyer&#x27;s request and cost.

These documentary requirements may result in two principal issues. Firstly, the stipulation for the buyer to complete the export declaration can be an issue in certain jurisdictions (not least the European Union) where the customs regulations require the declarant to be either an individual or corporation resident within the jurisdiction. If the buyer is based outside of the customs jurisdiction, they will be unable to clear the goods for export, meaning that the goods may be declared in the name of the seller by the buyer, even though the export formalities are the buyer&#x27;s responsibility under the EXW term.

Secondly, most jurisdictions require companies to provide proof of export for tax purposes. In an EXW shipment, the buyer is under no obligation to provide such proof to the seller, or indeed to even export the goods. In a customs jurisdiction such as the European Union, this would leave the seller liable to a sales tax bill as if the goods were sold to a domestic customer. It is therefore of utmost importance that these matters are discussed with the buyer before the contract is agreed. It may well be that another Incoterm, such as FCA &quot;seller&#x27;s premises&quot;, may be more suitable, since this puts the onus for declaring the goods for export onto the seller, which provides for more control over the export process.

=== FCA – Free Carrier (named place of delivery)===

The seller delivers the goods, cleared for export, at a named place (possibly including the seller&#x27;s own premises). The goods can be delivered to a carrier nominated by the buyer, or to another party nominated by the buyer.

In many respects this Incoterm has replaced FOB in modern usage, although the critical point at which the risk passes moves from loading aboard the vessel to the named place. The chosen place of delivery affects the obligations of loading and unloading the goods at that place.

If delivery occurs at the seller&#x27;s premises, or at any other location that is under the seller&#x27;s control, the seller is responsible for loading the goods on to the buyer&#x27;s carrier. However, if delivery occurs at any other place, the seller is deemed to have delivered the goods once their transport has arrived at the named place; the buyer is responsible for both unloading the goods and loading them onto self own carrier.

=== CPT – Carriage Paid To (named place of destination) ===

CPT replaces the C&amp;F (cost and freight) and CFR terms for all shipping modes outside of non-containerized sea freight.

The seller pays for the carriage of the goods up to the named place of destination. However, the goods are considered to be delivered when the goods have been handed over to the first or main carrier, so that the risk transfers to buyer upon handing goods over to that carrier at the place of shipment in the country of Export.

The seller is responsible for origin costs including export clearance and freight costs for carriage to the named place of destination (either the final destination such as the buyer&#x27;s facilities or a port of destination. This has to be agreed to by seller and buyer, however).

If the buyer requires the seller to obtain insurance, the Incoterm CIP should be considered instead.

===CIP – Carriage and Insurance Paid to (named place of destination)===

This term is broadly similar to the above CPT term, with the exception that the seller is required to obtain insurance for the goods while in transit. CIP requires the seller to insure the goods for 110% of the contract value under Institute Cargo Clauses (A) of the Institute of London Underwriters (which is a change from Incoterms 2010 where the minimum was Institute Cargo Clauses (C)), or any similar set of clauses, unless specifically agreed by both parties. The policy should be in the same currency as the contract, and should allow the buyer, the seller, and anyone else with an insurable interest in the goods to be able to make a claim.

CIP can be used for all modes of transport, whereas the Incoterm CIF should only be used for non-containerized sea-freight.

===DPU – Delivered At Place Unloaded (named place of destination)===

This Incoterm requires that the seller delivers the goods, unloaded, at the named place of destination. The seller covers all the costs of transport (export fees, carriage, unloading from main carrier at destination port and destination port charges) and assumes all risk until arrival at the destination port or terminal.

The terminal can be a port, airport, or inland freight interchange, but must be a facility with the capability to receive the shipment. If the seller is not able to organize unloading, they should consider shipping under DAP terms instead. All charges after unloading (for example, import duty, taxes, customs and on-carriage) are to be borne by buyer. However, any delay or demurrage charges at the terminal will generally be for the seller&#x27;s account.

Some uncertainty has emerged since Incoterms 2020 were adopted as to the meaning of &quot;unloaded&quot; when goods are delivered in a container, usually by sea, as the removal of the container from the incoming vessel may suggest that it has been &quot;unloaded&quot;, but the goods themselves are not yet &quot;unloaded&quot; while they remain in the container.

===DAP – Delivered At Place (named place of destination)===

Incoterms 2010 defines DAP as &#x27;Delivered at Place&#x27; – the seller delivers when the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer on the arriving means of transport ready for unloading at the named place of destination. Under DAP terms, the risk passes from seller to buyer from the point of destination mentioned in the contract of delivery.

Once goods are ready for shipment, the necessary packing is carried out by the seller at their own cost, so that the goods reach their final destination safely. All necessary legal formalities in the exporting country are completed by the seller at their own cost and risk to clear the goods for export.

After arrival of the goods in the country of destination, the customs clearance in the importing country needs to be completed by the buyer, e.g. import permit, documents required by customs, etc., including all customs duties and taxes.

Under DAP terms, all carriage expenses with any terminal expenses are paid by seller up to the agreed destination point. The necessary unloading cost at final destination has to be borne by buyer under DAP terms.

===DDP – Delivered Duty Paid (named place of destination)===

Seller is responsible for delivering the goods to the named place in the country of the buyer, and pays all costs in bringing the goods to the destination including import duties and taxes. The seller is not responsible for unloading. This term is often used in place of the non-Incoterm &quot;Free In Store (FIS)&quot;. This term places the maximum obligations on the seller and minimum obligations on the buyer. No risk or responsibility is transferred to the buyer until delivery of the goods at the named place of destination.

The most important consideration for DDP terms is that the seller is responsible for clearing the goods through customs in the buyer&#x27;s country, including both paying the duties and taxes, and obtaining the necessary authorizations and registrations from the authorities in that country. Unless the rules and regulations in the buyer&#x27;s country are very well understood, DDP terms can be a very big risk both in terms of delays and in unforeseen extra costs, and should be used with caution.

==Rules for sea and inland waterway transport==

To determine if a location qualifies for these four rules, please refer to &#x27;United Nations Code for Trade and Transport Locations (UN/LOCODE)&#x27;.

The four rules defined by Incoterms 2020 for international trade where transportation is entirely conducted by water are as per the below. It is important to note that these terms are generally not suitable for shipments in shipping containers; the point at which risk and responsibility for the goods passes is when the goods are loaded on board the ship, and if the goods are sealed into a shipping container it is impossible to verify the condition of the goods at this point.

Also of note is that the point at which risk passes under these terms has shifted from previous editions of Incoterms, where the risk passed at the ship&#x27;s rail.

===FAS – Free Alongside Ship (named port of shipment)===
The seller delivers when the goods are placed alongside the buyer&#x27;s vessel at the named port of shipment. This means that the buyer has to bear all costs and risks of loss of or damage to the goods from that moment. The FAS term requires the seller to clear the goods for export, which is a reversal from previous Incoterms versions that required the buyer to arrange for export clearance. However, if the parties wish the buyer to clear the goods for export, this should be made clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in the contract of sale. This term should be used only for non-containerized sea freight and inland waterway transport.

===FOB – Free on Board (named port of shipment)===

Under FOB terms the seller bears all costs and risks up to the point the goods are loaded on board the vessel. The seller&#x27;s responsibility does not end at that point unless the goods are &quot;appropriated to the contract&quot; that is, they are &quot;clearly set aside or otherwise identified as the contract goods&quot;. Therefore, FOB contract requires a seller to deliver goods on board a vessel that is to be designated by the buyer in a manner customary at the particular port. In this case, the seller must also arrange for export clearance. On the other hand, the buyer pays cost of marine freight transportation, bill of lading fees, insurance, unloading and transportation cost from the arrival port to destination. Since Incoterms 1980 introduced the Incoterm FCA, FOB should only be used for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport. However, FOB is commonly used incorrectly for all modes of transport despite the contractual risks that this can introduce. In some common law countries such as the United States of America, FOB is not only connected with the carriage of goods by sea but also used for inland carriage aboard any &quot;vessel, car or other vehicle.&quot;

===CFR – Cost and Freight (named port of destination)===
The seller pays for the carriage of the goods up to the named port of destination. Risk transfers to buyer when the goods have been loaded on board the ship in the country of Export. The seller is responsible for origin costs including export clearance and freight costs for carriage to the named port. The shipper is not responsible for delivery to the final destination from the port (generally the buyer&#x27;s facilities), or for buying insurance. If the buyer requires the seller to obtain insurance, the Incoterm CIF should be considered. CFR should only be used for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport; for all other modes of transport it should be replaced with CPT.

===CIF – Cost, Insurance &amp; Freight (named port of destination)===
====Use preceding Incoterms====
The term &quot;cost, insurance, freight&quot; or &quot;c.i.f.&quot; predates the introduction of Incoterms. Craighall noted in a 1919 article that in &quot;earlier times&quot; the initials were usually written &quot;C. F. &amp; I.&quot;: he quotes the phrase &quot;C. F. &amp; I. by steamer to N.Y.&quot; used in a shipping contract addressed in the New York State case of Mee v. McNider (1886).

The first English court case which referred to c.i.f. was Tregelles v. Sewell (1862), where the court established that under c.i.f. terms, risk passes to the buyer on shipment. In the case of E. Clemens Horst Co. v. Biddell Brothers, the UK House of Lords ruled in 1911 that &quot;the sellers in a c.i.f. contract were entitled to payment of the price upon tender of the bill of lading and insurance policy. The purchasers&#x27; intent to wait for satisfactory delivery and inspection was overruled. Shortly afterwards in 1915-16, the case of Arnhold Karberg &amp; Co. v. Blythe, Green, Jourdain &amp; Co. in the High Court and Court of Appeal showcased judicial debate about whether a c.i.f. bill of lading could evidence a sale of goods, Scrutton J ruling in the High Court that it did not, because a c.i.f. sale is &quot;not a sale of goods, but a sale of documents relating to goods&quot;. The Court of Appeal upheld his decision, although Bankes LJ and Warrington LJ argued that &quot;a c.i.f. contract is a contract for the sale of goods to be performed by the delivery of the documents&quot;. In a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals case referencing the Arnhold Karberg case and also Manbre Saccharine v Corn Products (1919), it was explained that &quot;under a c. i. f. contract the obligation of the seller is to deliver documents rather than goods, to transfer symbols rather than physical property&quot;. In the Manbre Saccharine case the seller was unable to enforce the c.i.f. contract where the goods had been lost at sea, but McCardie J emphasised that this was because no insurance policy was tendered, only a letter confirming insurance, and also because the goods did not match the contracted description: had these matters been otherwise, the contract would have been enforced.

====Incoterms usage====
As an Incoterm, CIF is broadly similar to the term CFR, with the exception that the seller is required to obtain insurance for the goods while in transit. CIF requires the seller to insure the goods for 110% of the contract value under Institute Cargo Clauses (A) of the Institute of London Underwriters (which is a change from Incoterms 2010 where the minimum was Institute Cargo Clauses (C)), or any similar set of clauses, unless specifically agreed by both parties. The policy should be in the same currency as the contract. The seller must also turn over documents necessary, to obtain the goods from the carrier or to assert claim against an insurer to the buyer. The documents include (as a minimum) the invoice, the insurance policy, and the bill of lading. These three documents represent the cost, insurance, and freight of CIF. The seller&#x27;s obligation ends when the documents are handed over to the buyer. Then, the buyer has to pay at the agreed price. Another point to consider is that CIF should only be used for non-containerized sea freight; for all other modes of transport it should be replaced with CIP.

==Allocations of costs to buyer/seller according to Incoterms 2020==
With all Incoterms beginning with D there is no obligation to provide insurance, however the insurable risk is for the seller&#x27;s account.

==Allocations of risks to buyer/seller according to Incoterms 2020==

The risk and the cost is not always the same for Incoterms. In many cases, the risk and cost usually goes together but it is not always the case. The below represents the transfer of risk.

Rules for sea and inland waterway transport
Rules for any modes of transport
==Previous Incoterms==

While these terms do not feature in the current version of Incoterms it is possible that they may be seen in sales order contracts. Care must be taken to ensure that both parties agree on their obligations in this case.

===DAF – Delivered at Frontier (named place of delivery)===
This term can be used when the goods are transported by rail and road. The seller pays for transportation to the named place of delivery at the frontier. The buyer arranges for customs clearance and pays for transportation from the frontier to their factory. The passing of risk occurs at the frontier.

===DAT – Delivered at Terminal===
This term means that the seller delivers the goods to the buyer to the named terminal in the contract of sale, unloaded from the main carriage vehicle.
The seller is responsible for making a safe delivery of goods to the named terminal, paying all transportation and export and transit customs clearance expenses. The seller bears the risks and costs associated with supplying the goods to the delivery terminal and unloading them, where the buyer becomes responsible for paying the duty and taxes, as well as any further carriage to a destination.

===DES – Delivered Ex Ship ===

Where goods are delivered ex ship, the passing of risk does not occur until the ship has arrived at the named port of destination and the goods made available for unloading to the buyer. The seller pays the same freight and insurance costs as they would under a CIF arrangement. Unlike CFR and CIF terms, the seller has agreed to bear not just cost, but also Risk and Title up to the arrival of the vessel at the named port. Costs for unloading the goods and any duties, taxes, etc. are for the Buyer. Until 2011, DES was a commonly used term in shipping bulk commodities, such as coal, grain, dry chemicals; and where the seller either owned or had chartered their own vessel.

===DEQ – Delivered Ex Quay (named port of delivery)===

This is similar to DES, but the passing of risk does not occur until the goods have been unloaded at the port of discharge.

===DDU – Delivered Duty Unpaid (named place of destination)===

This term means that the seller delivers the goods to the buyer to the named place of destination in the contract of sale. A transaction in international trade where the seller is responsible for making a safe delivery of goods to a named destination, paying all transportation and export and transit customs clearance expenses. The seller bears the risks and costs associated with supplying the goods to the delivery location, where the buyer becomes responsible for paying the duty and taxes.

===FOR - Free on rail and FOT - Free on truck===
These two terms were both included in Incoterms 1953, in each case specifying a named departure point.

<doc id="268524" wikidata="Q1050837" url="?curid=268524" title="Ship of Theseus">
<text>The Ship of Theseus, also known as Theseus&#x27;s Paradox, is a paradox and a common thought experiment about whether an object is the same object after having all of its original components replaced over time, typically one after the other.

In Greek mythology, Theseus, the mythical king of the city of Athens, rescued the children of Athens from King Minos after slaying the minotaur and then escaped onto a ship going to Delos. Each year, the Athenians would commemorate this by taking the ship on a pilgrimage to Delos to honour Apollo. A question was raised by ancient philosophers: If no pieces of the original made up the current ship was it still the Ship of Theseus? Furthermore, if it was no longer the same, when had it ceased existing as the original ship?

In contemporary philosophy, this thought experiment has applications to the philosophical study of identity over time. It has inspired a variety of proposed solutions and concepts in contemporary philosophy of mind concerned with the persistence of personal identity.

==History==
In its original formulation, the &quot;Ship of Theseus&quot; paradox concerns a debate over whether or not a ship that has had all of its components replaced one by one would remain the same ship. The account of the problem has been preserved by Plutarch in his &quot;Life of Theseus&quot;:

Over a millennium later, the philosopher Thomas Hobbes extended the thought experiment by supposing that a ship custodian gathered up all of the decayed parts of the ship as they were disposed of and replaced by the Athenians, and used those decayed planks to build a second ship. Hobbes then posed the question of which of the two resulting ships—the custodian&#x27;s or the Athenians&#x27;—was the same ship as the &quot;original&quot; ship.

Hobbes considers the two resulting ships as illustrating two definitions of &quot;Identity&quot; or sameness that are being compared to the original ship:

#the ship that maintains the same &quot;Form&quot; as the original, that which persists through complete replacement of material and;
#the ship made of the same &quot;Matter&quot;, that which stops being 100 per cent the same ship when the first part is replaced.

==Proposed resolutions==
The Ship of Theseus paradox can be thought of as an example of a puzzle of material constitution — that is, a problem with determining the relationship between an object and the material of which it is made.

===Constitution is not identity===
According to the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;, the most popular solution is to accept the conclusion that the material out of which the ship is made is not the same object as the ship, but that the two objects simply occupy the same space at the same time.

===Temporal parts===

Another common theory, put forth by David Lewis, is to divide up all objects into three-dimensional time-slices which are temporally distinct. This avoids the issue that the two different ships exist in the same space at one time and a different space at another time by considering the objects to be distinct from each other at &quot;all&quot; points in time.

===Cognitive science===
According to other scientists, the thought puzzle arises because of extreme externalism: the assumption that what is true in our minds also holds true in the world. Noam Chomsky says that this is not an unassailable assumption, from the perspective of the natural sciences, because human intuition is often mistaken. Cognitive science would treat this thought puzzle as the subject of an investigation of the human mind. Studying this human confusion can reveal much about the brain&#x27;s operation, but little about the nature of the human-independent external world.

Following on from this observation, a significant strand in cognitive science would consider the ship not as a thing, nor even a collection of objectively existing thing parts, but rather as an organisational structure that has perceptual continuity.

===Deflationism===
According to the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;, the deflationist view is that the facts of the thought experiment are undisputed; the only dispute is over the meaning of the term &quot;ship&quot; and is thus merely verbal. American philosopher Hilary Putnam asserts that &quot;the logical primitives themselves, and in particular the notions of object and existence, have a multitude of different uses rather than one absolute &#x27;meaning&#x27;.&quot; This thesis—that there are many meanings for the existential quantifier that are equally natural and equally adequate for describing all the facts—is often referred to as &quot;the doctrine of quantifier variance.&quot;

===Continued identity theory===
This solution (proposed by Kate, Ernest et al.) sees an object as staying the same as long as it continuously and metaphysically exists under the same identity without being fully transformed at one time. For instance, a house that has its front wall destroyed and replaced at Year One, the ceiling replaced at Year Two, and so on, until every part of the house has been replaced will still be understood as the same house. However, if every wall, the floor, and the roof are destroyed and replaced at the same time, it will be known as a new house.

==Alternative forms==
In Europe, several independent tales and stories feature knives of which the blades and handles had been replaced several times but are still used and represent the same knife. France has Jeannot&#x27;s knife, Spain uses Jeannot&#x27;s knife as a proverb, though it is referred to simply as &quot;the family knife&quot;, and Hungary has &quot;Lajos Kossuth&#x27;s pocket knife&quot;. Several variants or alternative statements of the underlying problem are known, including the grandfather&#x27;s axe and Trigger&#x27;s broom, where an old axe or broom has had both its head and its handle replaced, leaving no original components.

The ancient Buddhist text &quot;Da zhidu lun&quot; contains a similar philosophical puzzle: a story of a traveller who encountered two demons in the night. As one demon ripped off all parts of the traveler&#x27;s body one by one, the other demon replaced them with those of a corpse, and the traveller was confused about who he was.

The French critic and essayist Roland Barthes refers at least twice to a ship that is entirely rebuilt, in the preface to his &quot;Essais Critiques&quot; (1971) and later in his &quot;Roland Barthes par Roland Barthes&quot; (1975); in the latter, the persistence of the form of the ship is seen as a key structuralist principle. He calls this ship the &quot;Argo&quot;, on which Theseus was said to have sailed with Jason; he may have confused the &quot;Argo&quot; (referred to in passing in Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Theseus&quot; at 19.4) with the ship that sailed from Crete (&quot;Theseus&quot;, 23.1).

In Japan, the Ise Grand Shrine is rebuilt every twenty years with entirely &quot;new wood&quot;. The continuity over the centuries is considered spiritual and comes from the source of the wood, which is harvested from an adjoining forest that is considered sacred.

In the United States, a man claims to own the axe that George Washington used to cut down the cherry tree but the axe handle has been replaced twice and the axe head has been replaced once.

<doc id="268541" wikidata="Q1345412" url="?curid=268541" title="Ivy Lee">
<text>Ivy Ledbetter Lee (July 16, 1877 – November 9, 1934) was an American publicity expert and a founder of modern public relations. Lee is best known for his public relations work with the Rockefeller Family.

His first major client was the Pennsylvania Railroad, followed by numerous major railroads such as the New York Central, the Baltimore and Ohio, and the Harriman lines such as the Union Pacific. He established the Association of Railroad Executives, which included providing public relations services to the industry. Lee advised major industrial corporations, including steel, automobile, tobacco, meat packing and rubber, as well as public utilities, banks and foreign governments.

Lee pioneered the use of internal magazines to maintain employee morale, as well as management newsletters, stockholder reports and news releases to the media. He did a great deal of pro bono work, which he knew was important to his own public image. During WWI, he became the publicity director for the American Red Cross.

==Early life and career==
Lee was born near Cedartown, Georgia, the son of Emma Eufaula (Ledbetter) and a Methodist minister, James Wideman Lee, author of several books and a contributor to John L. Brandt&#x27;s &quot;Anglo-Saxon Supremacy, or, Race Contributions to Civilization&quot; (1915); who founded a prominent Atlanta family. Ivy Lee studied at Emory College and then graduated from Princeton. He worked as a newspaper reporter and stringer. He was a journalist at the &quot;New York American&quot;, the &quot;New York Times&quot;, and the &quot;New York World&quot;.

Lee got his first job in 1903 as a publicity manager for the Citizens Union. He authored the book &quot;The Best Administration New York City Ever Had&quot; (1903). He later took a job with the Democratic National Committee. Lee married Cornelia Bartlett Bigalow in 1901. They had three children: Alice Lee in 1902, James Wideman Lee II in 1906, and Ivy Lee, Jr. in 1909.

Together with George Parker, he established the nation&#x27;s third public relations firm, Parker and Lee, in 1905. The agency boasted of &quot;Accuracy, Authenticity, and Interest.&quot; It made this partnership after working together in the Democratic Party headquarters, handling publicity for Judge Alton Parker&#x27;s unsuccessful presidential race against Theodore Roosevelt in 1904.

The Parker and Lee firm lasted less than four years, but the junior partner, Lee, was to become one of the most influential pioneers in public relations. He evolved his philosophy in 1906 into the &quot;Declaration of Principles&quot;, the first articulation of the concept that public relations practitioners have a public responsibility that extends beyond obligations to the client. In the same year, after the 1906 Atlantic City train wreck, Lee issued what is often considered to be the first press release, after persuading the company to disclose information to journalists before they could hear it elsewhere.

When Lee was hired full-time by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1912, he was considered to be the first public relations person placed in an executive-level position. In fact, his archives reveal that he drafted one of the first job descriptions of a VP-level corporate public relations position.

In 1919, he founded a public relations counseling office, Ivy Lee &amp; Associates.

During World War I, Lee served as a publicity director, and later as Assistant to the Chairman of the American Red Cross.

Through his sister Laura, Lee was an uncle to novelist William S. Burroughs.

Ivy Lee died of a brain tumor in New York City at age 57.

==Effect on public relations==
Many historians credit Lee with being the originator of modern crisis communications. His principal competitor in the new public relations industry was Edward Bernays, and he has been credited with influencing Pendleton Dudley to enter the then-nascent field.

In 1914, he was to enter public relations on a much larger scale when he was retained by John D. Rockefeller Jr to represent his family and Standard Oil (&quot;to burnish the family image&quot;), after their bloody repression of the coal mining strike in Colorado known as the &quot;Ludlow Massacre.&quot; Lee warned that the Rockefellers were losing public support due to ordering the massacre of striking workers and their families (and the burning of their homes). He developed a strategy that Junior followed to repair it. It was necessary for Junior to overcome his shyness, go personally to Colorado to meet with the miners and their families, inspect the conditions of the homes and the factories, attend social events and listen to the grievances (all the while being photographed for press releases). This was novel advice which attracted widespread media attention, and opened the way to wallpaper over the conflict and present a more humanized version of the wealthy Rockefellers.

Lee guided public relations of Rockefellers and their corporate interests, including a strong involvement in the construction of the Rockefeller Center, even after he moved on to establish his own consulting firm. He was the person who brought the original, unfunded plan for Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s expansion to Junior&#x27;s attention, and he convinced Junior to rename the center after the family against the latter&#x27;s wishes.

Lee became an inaugural member of the Council on Foreign Relations in the US when it was established in New York in 1921. In the early 1920s, he promoted friendly relations with Soviet Russia. In 1926, Lee wrote a famous letter to the president of the US Chamber of Commerce in which he presented a convincing argument for the need to normalize US-Soviet political and economic relations.

His supposed instruction to the son of the Standard Oil fortune was to echo in public relations henceforth: &quot;Tell the truth, because sooner or later the public will find out anyway. And if the public doesn&#x27;t like what you are doing, change your policies and bring them into line with what people want.&quot; The context of the quote was said to be apocryphal, being spread by Lee as self-promotion, making it both famous and infamous.

Lee is considered to be the father of the modern public relations campaign when, from 1913 to 1914, he successfully lobbied for a railroad rate increase from a reluctant federal government.

Lee espoused a philosophy consistent with what has sometimes been called the &quot;two-way street&quot; approach to public relations, in which PR consists of helping clients listen as well as communicate messages to their publics.

Lee advised foreign governments and provided public relations counsel to a German company during the early days of the Nazi government, work that put him in communication with the party leaders, possibly including Adolf Hitler. Shortly before his death in 1934, the US Congress had been investigating his work in Germany on behalf of the company IG Farben. During his work with the dye trust, Lee protested the group&#x27;s use of Nazi propaganda and fascist messages. But in doing so, he may have been unaware that his advice was being transmitted directly to the Nazi government and that the Dye Trust had quickly become nationalized under the regime.

Lee also worked for the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, in which capacity he famously advised managers to list and number their top priorities every day, and work on tasks in the order of their importance until daily time allows, not proceeding until a task was completed. For this suggestion company head Charles M. Schwab later paid him $25,000 (the equivalent of $400,000 in 2016 dollars), saying it had been the most profitable advice he had received. Over his career he also was a public relations advisor to George Westinghouse, Charles Lindbergh, John W. Davis, Otto Kahn and Walter Chrysler.

==Effect on Productivity Studies==

Productivity experts and platforms have cited the &quot;Ivy Lee Method&quot; for improving individuals&#x27; efficiency in managing tasks and getting things done. This was the method that Lee reportedly taught Charles M. Schwab and his employees at the Bethlehem Steel Corporation. It works on the principle of listing six important tasks for each day – setting clear priorities the night before – and focusing on completing them the next day before adding more. By emphasizing focus and recognizing limits on a person&#x27;s time and energy, the method runs counter to the idea of multitasking.

== In popular culture ==

Ivy Lee is name checked by the British indie rock band Sea Power on their 2017 album Let the Dancers Inherit the Party with a song titled The Voice of Ivy Lee.

<doc id="268567" wikidata="Q244356" url="?curid=268567" title="Battle of Ain Jalut">
<text>The Battle of Ain Jalut (), also spelled Ayn Jalut, was fought between the Bahri Mamluks of Egypt and the Mongol Empire on 3 September 1260 (25 Ramadan 658 AH) near the spring of Ain Jalut in southeastern Galilee in the Jezreel Valley. It marks as the first major loss of the Mongolian advances and halted their expansion into Arabia and Europe.

Continuing the westward expansion of the Mongol Empire, the armies of Hulagu Khan captured and sacked Baghdad in 1258, along with the Ayyubid capital of Damascus sometime later. Hulagu sent envoys to Cairo demanding Qutuz surrender Egypt, to which Qutuz responded by killing the envoys and displaying their heads on the Bab Zuweila gate of Cairo. Shortly after this, Möngke Khan was slain in battle against the Southern Song. Hulagu returned to Mongolia with the bulk of his army to attend the kurultai in accordance with Mongol customs, leaving approximately 10,000 troops west of the Euphrates under the command of Kitbuqa.

Learning of these developments, Qutuz quickly advanced his army from Cairo towards Palestine. Kitbuqa sacked Sidon, before turning his army south towards the Spring of Harod to meet Qutuz&#x27; forces. Using hit-and-run tactics and a feigned retreat by Mamluk general Baibars, combined with a final flanking maneuver by Qutuz, the Mamluks forced the Mongol army to retreat toward Bisan, after which the Mamluks led a final counterattack, which resulted in the deaths of many Mongols, including Kitbuqa himself.

The battle has been cited as the first time the Mongols were permanently prevented from expanding their influence; it also marked the first of two defeats the Mongols would face in their attempts to invade Egypt and the Levant, the other being the Battle of Marj al-Saffar in 1303.

==Background==
When Möngke Khan became Great Khan in 1251, he immediately set out to implement his grandfather Genghis Khan&#x27;s plan for a world empire. To lead the task of subduing the nations in the West, he selected his brother, another of Genghis Khan&#x27;s grandsons, Hulagu Khan. Assembling the army took five years, and it was not until 1256 that Hulagu was prepared to begin the invasions. Operating from the Mongol base in Persia, Hulagu proceeded south. Möngke had ordered good treatment for those who yielded without resistance and destruction for the rest. In that way, Hulagu and his army had conquered some of the most powerful and longstanding dynasties of the time.

Other countries in the Mongols&#x27; path submitted to Mongol authority and contributed forces to the Mongol army. When the Mongols had reached Baghdad, their army included Cilician Armenians and even some Frankish forces from the Principality of Antioch. The Assassins in Persia fell, the 500-year-old Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad was destroyed (see Battle of Baghdad) and the Ayyubid dynasty in Damascus fell as well. Hulagu&#x27;s plan was then to proceed southwards through the Kingdom of Jerusalem towards the Mamluk Sultanate, to confront the major Islamic power.

During the Mongol attack on the Mamluks in the Middle East, most of the Mamluks were Kipchaks, and the Golden Horde&#x27;s supply of Kipchaks replenished the Mamluk armies and helped them fight off the Mongols.

In 1260, Hulagu sent envoys to Qutuz in Cairo with a letter demanding his surrender. Qutuz responded, however, by killing the envoys and displaying their heads on Bab Zuweila, one of the gates of Cairo. Hulagu withdrew from the Levant with the bulk of his army, leaving his forces west of the Euphrates with only one tumen (nominally 10,000 men, but usually fewer), and a handful of vassal troops under the Naiman Nestorian Christian general Kitbuqa. Contemporary Mamluk chronicler al-Yunini&#x27;s &quot;Dhayl Mirat Al-Zaman&quot; states that the Mongol army under Kitbuqa, including vassals, numbered 100,000 men in total, but this was likely an exaggeration.

Until the late 20th century, historians believed that Hulagu&#x27;s sudden retreat had been caused by the power dynamic having been changed by the death of the Great Khan Möngke on an expedition to the Song dynasty&#x27;s China, which made Hulagu and other senior Mongols return home to decide his successor. However, contemporary documentation discovered in the 1980s reveals that to be untrue, as Hulagu himself claimed that he withdrew most of his forces because he could not sustain such a large army logistically, that the fodder in the region had been mostly used up and that a Mongol custom was to withdraw to cooler lands for the summer.

Upon receiving news of Hulagu&#x27;s departure, Mamluk Sultan Qutuz quickly assembled a large army at Cairo and invaded Palestine. In late August, Kitbuqa&#x27;s forces proceeded south from their base at Baalbek, passing to the east of Lake Tiberias into Lower Galilee. Qutuz was then allied with a fellow Mamluk, Baibars, who chose to ally himself with Qutuz in the face of a greater enemy after the Mongols had captured Damascus and most of Bilad ash-Sham.

=== Mongol invasion of the crusader states ===
The Mongols attempted to form a Franco-Mongol alliance or at least to demand the submission of the remnant of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, now centered on Acre; but Pope Alexander IV had forbidden it. Tensions between the Franks and the Mongols had also increased when Julian of Sidon caused an incident which resulted in the death of one of Kitbuqa&#x27;s grandsons. Angered, Kitbuqa sacked Sidon. The Barons of Acre and the remainder of the Crusader outposts, contacted by the Mongols, had also been approached by the Mamluks and sought military assistance against the Mongols.

Though the Mamluks were the traditional enemies of the Franks, the Barons of Acre recognised the Mongols as the more immediate menace and so the Crusaders opted for a position of cautious neutrality between the two forces. In an unusual move, they agreed that the Egyptian Mamluks could march north through the Crusader states unmolested and even camp to resupply near Acre. When news arrived that the Mongols had crossed the Jordan River, Sultan Qutuz and his forces proceeded southeast, toward the spring called Ain Jalut, also known as Harod&#x27;s spring in Hebrew, in the Jezreel Valley.

==Battle==

The first to advance were the Mongols, whose force also included troops from the Kingdom of Georgia and about 500 troops from the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, both of which had submitted to Mongol authority. The Mamluks had the advantage of knowing the terrain, and Qutuz capitalized on that by hiding the bulk of his force in the highlands and hoping to bait the Mongols with a smaller force, under Baibars.

Both armies fought for many hours, with Baibars usually implementing hit-and-run tactics to provoke the Mongol troops and to preserve the bulk of his troops intact. When the Mongols carried out another heavy assault, Baibars, who it is said had laid out the overall strategy of the battle since he had spent much time in that region earlier in his life as a fugitive, and his men feigned a final retreat to draw the Mongols into the highlands to be ambushed by the rest of the Mamluk forces concealed among the trees. The Mongol leader, Kitbuqa, already provoked by the constant fleeing of Baibars and his troops, committed a grave mistake. Instead of suspecting a trick, Kitbuqa decided to march forward with all of his troops on the trail of the fleeing Mamluks. When the Mongols reached the highlands, Mamluk forces emerged from hiding and began to fire arrows and attack with their cavalry. The Mongols then found themselves surrounded on all sides. Additionally, Timothy May hypothesizes that a key moment in the battle was the defection of the Mongol Syrian allies.

The Mongol army fought very fiercely and very aggressively to break out. Some distance away, Qutuz watched with his private legion. When Qutuz saw the left wing of the Mamluk army almost destroyed by the desperate Mongols seeking an escape route, he threw away his combat helmet, so that his warriors could recognize him and cried loudly three times &quot;O Islam! O Allah grant your servant Qutuz a victory against these Mongols&quot;. He was seen the next moment rushing fiercely towards the battlefield yelling &quot;wa islamah!&quot; (&quot;Oh my Islam&quot;), urging his army to keep firm and advancing towards the weakened side, followed by his own unit. The Mongols were pushed back and fled to a vicinity of Beisan, followed by Qutuz&#x27;s forces, but they managed to reorganize and to return to the battlefield, making a successful counterattack. However, the battle shifted toward the Mamluks, who now had both the geographic and psychological advantage, and some of the Mongols were eventually forced to retreat. Kitbuqa, with almost the rest of the Mongol army that had remained in the region, perished.

==Aftermath==
Hulagu Khan ordered the execution of the last Ayyubid emir of Aleppo and Damascus, An-Nasir Yusuf, and his brother, who were in captivity, after he heard the news of the defeat of the Mongol army at Ain Jalut. However, the Mamluks captured Damascus five days later after Ain Jalut, followed by Aleppo within a month.

On the way back to Cairo after the victory at Ain Jalut, Qutuz was assassinated by several emirs in a conspiracy led by Baibars. Baibars became the new Sultan. Local Ayyubid emirs sworn to the Mamluk sultanate subsequently defeated another Mongol force of 6,000 at Homs, which ended the first Mongol expedition into Syria. Baibars and his successors would go on to capture the last of the crusader states in the Holy Land by 1291.

Internecine conflict prevented Hulagu Khan from being able to bring his full power against the Mamluks to avenge the pivotal defeat at Ain Jalut. Berke Khan, the Khan of the Golden Horde to the north of Ilkhanate, had converted to Islam and watched with horror as his cousin destroyed the Abbasid Caliph, the spiritual and administrative center of Islam. The Muslim historian Rashid-al-Din Hamadani quoted Berke as sending the following message to Mongke Khan, protesting the attack on Baghdad since he did not know that Mongke had died in China: &quot;He (Hulagu) has sacked all the cities of the Muslims, and has brought about the death of the Caliph. With the help of God I will call him to account for so much innocent blood.&quot; The Mamluks, learning through spies that Berke was a Muslim and was not fond of his cousin, were careful to nourish their ties to him and his Khanate.

Later on, Hulagu was able to send only a small army of two tumens in his sole attempt to attack the Mamluks in Aleppo in December 1260. They were able to massacre a large number of Muslims in retaliation for the death of Kitbuqa, but after a fortnight could make no other progress and had to retreat.

After the Mongol succession was finally settled, with Kublai as the last Great Khan, Hulagu returned to his lands by 1262 and massed his armies to attack the Mamluks and avenge Ain Jalut. However, Berke Khan initiated a series of raids in force that lured Hulagu north, away from the Levant, to meet him. Hulagu suffered a severe defeat in an attempted invasion north of the Caucasus in 1263. That was the first open war among the Mongols and signaled the end of the unified empire. Hulagu Khan died in 1265 and was succeeded by his son Abaqa.

The Muslim Mamluks defeated the Mongols in all battles except one. Beside a victory to the Mamluks in Ain Jalut, the Mongols were defeated in the second Battle of Homs, Elbistan and Marj al-Saffar. After five battles with the Mamluks, the Mongols only won at the Battle of Wadi al-Khaznadar. They never returned to Syria again.

==Legacy==
===Medieval===
The large number of sources in vastly-different languages caused Mongol historians to have generally focused on one limited aspect of the empire. From that standpoint, the Battle of Ain Jalut has been represented by numerous academic and popular historians as an epochal battle. One that saw, for the first time, a Mongol advance that experienced their first major defeat and a permanent halt to forward movements.

According to Ahmad Yousef al-Hassan, Arabic military treatises of the 14th centuries state that the hand cannon was used by the Mamluk side in the Battle of Ain Jalut to frighten the Mongol armies, making it the earliest known battle for hand cannon being used. The compositions of the gunpowder used in the cannon were also given in those manuals. Hassan&#x27;s claims are contradicted by other historians such as David Ayalon, Iqtidar Alam Khan, Joseph Needham, Tonio Andrade, and Gabor Ágoston. Khan argues that it was the Mongols who introduced gunpowder to the Islamic world, and believes cannons only reached Mamluk Egypt in the 1370s. According to Needham, fire lances or proto-guns were known to Muslims by the late 13th century and early 14th century. However the term &quot;midfa&quot;, dated to textual sources from 1342 to 1352, cannot be proven to be true hand-guns or bombards, and contemporary accounts of a metal-barrel cannon in the Islamic world do not occur until 1365. Needham also concludes that in its original form the term &quot;midfa&quot; refers to the tube or cylinder of a naphtha projector (flamethrower), then after the invention of gunpowder it meant the tube of fire lances, and eventually it applied to the cylinder of hand-gun and cannon. Similarly, Andrade dates the textual appearance of cannon in middle eastern sources to the 1360s.

However, such claim contradicts other historians who claim hand cannons did not appear in the Middle East until the 14th century.

A recent study claims that the Mongol defeat was in part caused by a short term climate anomaly following the eruption of Samalas volcano a few years earlier, stating that &quot;a return to warmer and dryer conditions in the summer of 1260 CE, [...] likely reduced the regional carrying capacity and may therefore have forced a mass withdrawal of the Mongols from the region that contributed to the Mamluks’ victory.&quot; 
===Modern===

One of the three original brigades of the Palestine Liberation Army was named &quot;Ain Jalut&quot;, after the battle. In July 1970, Yasser Arafat referred to the modern area in the context of the historical battle:
This will not be the first time that our people has vanquished its enemies. The Mongols came and swept away the Abbasid caliphate, then they came to Ain Jalut in our land – in the same region where we are today fighting the Zionists – and they were defeated at Ain Jalut.

<text>Antivirus software (abbreviated to AV software), also known as anti-malware, is a computer program used to prevent, detect, and remove malware.

Antivirus software was originally developed to detect and remove computer viruses, hence the name. However, with the proliferation of other malware, antivirus software started to protect against other computer threats. Some products also include protection from malicious URLs, spam, and phishing.

== History ==

=== 1971–1980 period (pre-antivirus days) ===
The first known computer virus appeared in 1971 and was dubbed the &quot;Creeper virus&quot;. This computer virus infected Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s (DEC) PDP-10 mainframe computers running the TENEX operating system.

The Creeper virus was eventually deleted by a program created by Ray Tomlinson and known as &quot;The Reaper&quot;. Some people consider &quot;The Reaper&quot; the first antivirus software ever written – it may be the case, but it is important to note that the Reaper was actually a virus itself specifically designed to remove the Creeper virus.

The Creeper virus was followed by several other viruses. The first known that appeared &quot;in the wild&quot; was &quot;Elk Cloner&quot;, in 1981, which infected Apple II computers.

In 1983, the term &quot;computer virus&quot; was coined by Fred Cohen in one of the first ever published academic papers on computer viruses. Cohen used the term &quot;computer virus&quot; to describe programs that: &quot;affect other computer programs by modifying them in such a way as to include a (possibly evolved) copy of itself.&quot; (note that a more recent definition of computer virus has been given by the Hungarian security researcher Péter Szőr: &quot;a code that recursively replicates a possibly evolved copy of itself&quot;).

The first IBM PC compatible &quot;in the wild&quot; computer virus, and one of the first real widespread infections, was &quot;Brain&quot; in 1986. From then, the number of viruses has grown exponentially. Most of the computer viruses written in the early and mid-1980s were limited to self-reproduction and had no specific damage routine built into the code. That changed when more and more programmers became acquainted with computer virus programming and created viruses that manipulated or even destroyed data on infected computers.

Before internet connectivity was widespread, computer viruses were typically spread by infected floppy disks. Antivirus software came into use, but was updated relatively infrequently. During this time, virus checkers essentially had to check executable files and the boot sectors of floppy disks and hard disks. However, as internet usage became common, viruses began to spread online.

=== 1980–1990 period (early days) ===
There are competing claims for the innovator of the first antivirus product. Possibly, the first publicly documented removal of an &quot;in the wild&quot; computer virus (the &quot;Vienna virus&quot;) was performed by Bernd Fix in 1987.

In 1987, Andreas Lüning and Kai Figge, who founded G Data Software in 1985, released their first antivirus product for the Atari ST platform. In 1987, the &quot;Ultimate Virus Killer (UVK)&quot; was also released. This was the de facto industry standard virus killer for the Atari ST and Atari Falcon, the last version of which (version 9.0) was released in April 2004. In 1987, in the United States, John McAfee founded the McAfee company and, at the end of that year, he released the first version of VirusScan. Also in 1987 (in Czechoslovakia), Peter Paško, Rudolf Hrubý, and Miroslav Trnka created the first version of NOD antivirus.

In 1987, Fred Cohen wrote that &quot;there is no algorithm that can perfectly detect all possible computer viruses&quot;.

Finally, at the end of 1987, the first two heuristic antivirus utilities were released: &quot;Flushot Plus&quot; by Ross Greenberg and &quot;Anti4us&quot; by Erwin Lanting. In his O&#x27;Reilly book, &quot;Malicious Mobile Code: Virus Protection for Windows&quot;, Roger Grimes described Flushot Plus as &quot;the first holistic program to fight malicious mobile code (MMC).&quot;

However, the kind of heuristic used by early AV engines was totally different from those used today. The first product with a heuristic engine resembling modern ones was F-PROT in 1991. Early heuristic engines were based on dividing the binary into different sections: data section, code section (in a legitimate binary, it usually starts always from the same location). Indeed, the initial viruses re-organized the layout of the sections, or overrode the initial portion of a section in order to jump to the very end of the file where malicious code was located—only going back to resume execution of the original code. This was a very specific pattern, not used at the time by any legitimate software, which represented an elegant heuristic to catch suspicious code. Other kinds of more advanced heuristics were later added, such as suspicious section names, incorrect header size, regular expressions, and partial pattern in-memory matching.

In 1988, the growth of antivirus companies continued. In Germany, Tjark Auerbach founded Avira (&quot;H+BEDV&quot; at the time) and released the first version of &quot;AntiVir&quot; (named &quot;Luke Filewalker&quot; at the time). In Bulgaria, Vesselin Bontchev released his first freeware antivirus program (he later joined FRISK Software). Also Frans Veldman released the first version of ThunderByte Antivirus, also known as &quot;TBAV&quot; (he sold his company to Norman Safeground in 1998). In Czechoslovakia, Pavel Baudiš and Eduard Kučera founded Avast Software (at the time &quot;ALWIL Software&quot;) and released their first version of avast! antivirus. In June 1988, in South Korea, Ahn Cheol-Soo released its first antivirus software, called &quot;V1&quot; (he founded AhnLab later in 1995). Finally, in autumn 1988, in the United Kingdom, Alan Solomon founded S&amp;S International and created his &quot;Dr. Solomon&#x27;s Anti-Virus Toolkit&quot; (although he launched it commercially only in 1991 – in 1998 Solomon&#x27;s company was acquired by McAfee, then known as Network Associates Inc.).

Also in 1988, a mailing list named VIRUS-L was started on the BITNET/EARN network where new viruses and the possibilities of detecting and eliminating viruses were discussed. Some members of this mailing list were: Alan Solomon, Eugene Kaspersky (Kaspersky Lab), Friðrik Skúlason (FRISK Software), John McAfee (McAfee), Luis Corrons (Panda Security), Mikko Hyppönen (F-Secure), Péter Szőr, Tjark Auerbach (Avira) and Vesselin Bontchev (FRISK Software).

In 1989, in Iceland, Friðrik Skúlason created the first version of F-PROT Anti-Virus (he founded FRISK Software only in 1993). Meanwhile, in the United States, Symantec (founded by Gary Hendrix in 1982) launched its first &quot;Symantec antivirus for Macintosh&quot; (SAM). SAM 2.0, released March 1990, incorporated technology allowing users to easily update SAM to intercept and eliminate new viruses, including many that didn&#x27;t exist at the time of the program&#x27;s release.

In the end of the 1980s, in United Kingdom, Jan Hruska and Peter Lammer founded the security firm Sophos and began producing their first antivirus and encryption products. In the same period, in Hungary, VirusBuster was founded (and subsequently incorporated by Sophos).

=== 1990–2000 period (emergence of the antivirus industry) ===
In 1990, in Spain, Mikel Urizarbarrena founded Panda Security (&quot;Panda Software&quot; at the time). In Hungary, the security researcher Péter Szőr released the first version of &quot;Pasteur&quot; antivirus.

In 1990, the Computer Antivirus Research Organization (CARO) was founded. In 1991, CARO released the &quot;Virus Naming Scheme&quot;, originally written by Friðrik Skúlason and Vesselin Bontchev. Although this naming scheme is now outdated, it remains the only existing standard that most computer security companies and researchers ever attempted to adopt. CARO members includes: Alan Solomon, Costin Raiu, Dmitry Gryaznov, Eugene Kaspersky, Friðrik Skúlason, Igor Muttik, Mikko Hyppönen, Morton Swimmer, Nick FitzGerald, Padgett Peterson, Peter Ferrie, Righard Zwienenberg and Vesselin Bontchev.

In 1991, in the United States, Symantec released the first version of Norton AntiVirus. In the same year, in the Czech Republic, Jan Gritzbach and Tomáš Hofer founded AVG Technologies (&quot;Grisoft&quot; at the time), although they released the first version of their &quot;Anti-Virus Guard&quot; (AVG) only in 1992. On the other hand, in Finland, F-Secure (founded in 1988 by Petri Allas and Risto Siilasmaa – with the name of Data Fellows) released the first version of their antivirus product. F-Secure claims to be the first antivirus firm to establish a presence on the World Wide Web.

In 1991, the European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research (EICAR) was founded to further antivirus research and improve development of antivirus software.

In 1992, in Russia, Igor Danilov released the first version of &quot;SpiderWeb&quot;, which later became Dr.Web.

In 1994, AV-TEST reported that there were 28,613 unique malware samples (based on MD5) in their database.

Over time other companies were founded. In 1996, in Romania, Bitdefender was founded and released the first version of &quot;Anti-Virus eXpert&quot; (AVX). In 1997, in Russia, Eugene Kaspersky and Natalya Kaspersky co-founded security firm Kaspersky Lab.

In 1996, there was also the first &quot;in the wild&quot; Linux virus, known as &quot;Staog&quot;.

In 1999, AV-TEST reported that there were 98,428 unique malware samples (based on MD5) in their database.

=== 2000–2005 period ===
In 2000, Rainer Link and Howard Fuhs started the first open source antivirus engine, called &quot;OpenAntivirus Project&quot;.

In 2001, Tomasz Kojm released the first version of ClamAV, the first ever open source antivirus engine to be commercialised. In 2007, ClamAV was bought by Sourcefire, which in turn was acquired by Cisco Systems in 2013.

In 2002, in United Kingdom, Morten Lund and Theis Søndergaard co-founded the antivirus firm BullGuard.

In 2005, AV-TEST reported that there were 333,425 unique malware samples (based on MD5) in their database.

=== 2005–2014 period ===
In 2007, AV-TEST reported a number of 5,490,960 new unique malware samples (based on MD5) only for that year. In 2012 and 2013, antivirus firms reported a new malware samples range from 300,000 to over 500,000 per day.

Over the years it has become necessary for antivirus software to use several different strategies (e.g. specific email and network protection or low level modules) and detection algorithms, as well as to check an increasing variety of files, rather than just executables, for several reasons:
* Powerful macros used in word processor applications, such as Microsoft Word, presented a risk. Virus writers could use the macros to write viruses embedded within documents. This meant that computers could now also be at risk from infection by opening documents with hidden attached macros.
* The possibility of embedding executable objects inside otherwise non-executable file formats can make opening those files a risk.
* Later email programs, in particular Microsoft&#x27;s Outlook Express and Outlook, were vulnerable to viruses embedded in the email body itself. A user&#x27;s computer could be infected by just opening or previewing a message.

In 2005, F-Secure was the first security firm that developed an Anti-Rootkit technology, called &quot;BlackLight&quot;.

Because most users are usually connected to the Internet on a continual basis, Jon Oberheide first proposed a Cloud-based antivirus design in 2008.

In February 2008 McAfee Labs added the industry-first cloud-based anti-malware functionality to VirusScan under the name Artemis. It was tested by AV-Comparatives in February 2008 and officially unveiled in August 2008 in McAfee VirusScan.

Cloud AV created problems for comparative testing of security software – part of the AV definitions was out of testers control (on constantly updated AV company servers) thus making results non-repeatable. As a result, Anti-Malware Testing Standards Organisation (AMTSO) started working on method of testing cloud products which was adopted on May 7, 2009.

In 2011, AVG introduced a similar cloud service, called Protective Cloud Technology.

=== 2014–present: rise of next-gen, market consolidation ===
Following the 2013 release of the APT 1 report from Mandiant, the industry has seen a shift towards signature-less approaches to the problem capable of detecting and mitigating zero-day attacks. Numerous approaches to address these new forms of threats have appeared, including behavioral detection, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud-based file detection. According to Gartner, it is expected the rise of new entrants, such Carbon Black, Cylance and Crowdstrike will force end point protection incumbents into a new phase of innovation and acquisition.

One method from Bromium involves micro-virtualization to protect desktops from malicious code execution initiated by the end user. Another approach from SentinelOne and Carbon Black focuses on behavioral detection by building a full context around every process execution path in real time, while Cylance leverages an artificial intelligence model based on machine learning.

Increasingly, these signature-less approaches have been defined by the media and analyst firms as &quot;next-generation&quot; antivirus and are seeing rapid market adoption as certified antivirus replacement technologies by firms such as Coalfire and DirectDefense. In response, traditional antivirus vendors such as Trend Micro, Symantec and Sophos have responded by incorporating &quot;next-gen&quot; offerings into their portfolios as analyst firms such as Forrester and Gartner have called traditional signature-based antivirus &quot;ineffective&quot; and &quot;outdated&quot;.

As of Windows 8, Windows includes its own free antivirus protection under the Windows Defender brand. Despite bad detection scores in its early days, AV-Test now certifies Defender as one of its top products. While it isn&#x27;t publicly known how the inclusion of antivirus software in Windows affected antivirus sales, Google search traffic for antivirus has declined significantly since 2010. In 2014 Microsoft bought McAfee.

Since 2016, there has been a notable amount of consolidation in the industry. Avast purchased AVG in 2016 for $1.3 billion. Avira was acquired by Norton owner Gen Digital (then NortonLifeLock) in 2020 for $360 million. In 2021, the Avira division of Gen Digital acquired BullGuard. The BullGuard brand was discontinued in 2022 and its customers were migrated to Norton. In 2022, Gen Digital acquired Avast, effectively consolidating four major antivirus brands under one owner.

As of 2024, more than half of Americans use built-in antivirus protection for their devices like Microsoft Defender or XProtect from Apple. However, about 121 million adults still use third-party antivirus software. Half of these adults use paid products, and about 50% of third-party software users - the owners of personal computers and Windows operating systems.

== Identification methods ==
In 1987, Frederick B. Cohen demonstrated that the algorithm which would be able to detect all possible viruses can&#x27;t possibly exist (like the algorithm which determines whether or not the given program halts). However, using different layers of defense, a good detection rate may be achieved.

There are several methods which antivirus engines can use to identify malware:
* Sandbox detection: a particular behavioural-based detection technique that, instead of detecting the behavioural fingerprint at run time, it executes the programs in a virtual environment, logging what actions the program performs. Depending on the actions logged which can include memory usage and network accesses, the antivirus engine can determine if the program is malicious or not. If not, then, the program is executed in the real environment. Although this technique has shown to be quite effective, given its heaviness and slowness, it is rarely used in end-user antivirus solutions.
* Data mining techniques: one of the latest approaches applied in malware detection. Data mining and machine learning algorithms are used to try to classify the behaviour of a file (as either malicious or benign) given a series of file features, that are extracted from the file itself.

=== Signature-based detection ===
Traditional antivirus software relies heavily upon signatures to identify malware.

Substantially, when a malware sample arrives in the hands of an antivirus firm, it is analysed by malware researchers or by dynamic analysis systems. Then, once it is determined to be a malware, a proper signature of the file is extracted and added to the signatures database of the antivirus software.

Although the signature-based approach can effectively contain malware outbreaks, malware authors have tried to stay a step ahead of such software by writing &quot;oligomorphic&quot;, &quot;polymorphic&quot; and, more recently, &quot;metamorphic&quot; viruses, which encrypt parts of themselves or otherwise modify themselves as a method of disguise, so as to not match virus signatures in the dictionary.

=== Heuristics ===
Many viruses start as a single infection and through either mutation or refinements by other attackers, can grow into dozens of slightly different strains, called variants. Generic detection refers to the detection and removal of multiple threats using a single virus definition.

For example, the Vundo trojan has several family members, depending on the antivirus vendor&#x27;s classification. Symantec classifies members of the Vundo family into two distinct categories, &quot;Trojan.Vundo&quot; and &quot;Trojan.Vundo.B&quot;.

While it may be advantageous to identify a specific virus, it can be quicker to detect a virus family through a generic signature or through an inexact match to an existing signature. Virus researchers find common areas that all viruses in a family share uniquely and can thus create a single generic signature. These signatures often contain non-contiguous code, using wildcard characters where differences lie. These wildcards allow the scanner to detect viruses even if they are padded with extra, meaningless code. A detection that uses this method is said to be &quot;heuristic detection&quot;.

=== Rootkit detection ===

Anti-virus software can attempt to scan for rootkits. A rootkit is a type of malware designed to gain administrative-level control over a computer system without being detected. Rootkits can change how the operating system functions and in some cases can tamper with the anti-virus program and render it ineffective. Rootkits are also difficult to remove, in some cases requiring a complete re-installation of the operating system.

=== Real-time protection ===
Real-time protection, on-access scanning, background guard, resident shield, autoprotect, and other synonyms refer to the automatic protection provided by most antivirus, anti-spyware, and other anti-malware programs. This monitors computer systems for suspicious activity such as computer viruses, spyware, adware, and other malicious objects. Real-time protection detects threats in opened files and scans apps in real-time as they are installed on the device. When inserting a CD, opening an email, or browsing the web, or when a file already on the computer is opened or executed.

== Issues of concern ==
=== Unexpected renewal costs ===
Some commercial antivirus software end-user license agreements include a clause that the subscription will be automatically renewed, and the purchaser&#x27;s credit card automatically billed, at the renewal time without explicit approval. For example, McAfee requires users to unsubscribe at least 60 days before the expiration of the present subscription, while Bitdefender sends notifications to unsubscribe 30 days before the renewal. Norton AntiVirus also renews subscriptions automatically by default.

=== Rogue security applications ===
Some apparent antivirus programs are actually malware masquerading as legitimate software, such as WinFixer, MS Antivirus, and Mac Defender.

=== Problems caused by false positives ===
A &quot;false positive&quot; or &quot;false alarm&quot; is when antivirus software identifies a non-malicious file as malware. When this happens, it can cause serious problems. For example, if an antivirus program is configured to immediately delete or quarantine infected files, as is common on Microsoft Windows antivirus applications, a false positive in an essential file can render the Windows operating system or some applications unusable. Recovering from such damage to critical software infrastructure incurs technical support costs and businesses can be forced to close whilst remedial action is undertaken.

Examples of serious false-positives:

* May 2007: a faulty virus signature issued by Symantec mistakenly removed essential operating system files, leaving thousands of PCs unable to boot.
* May 2007: the executable file required by Pegasus Mail on Windows was falsely detected by Norton AntiVirus as being a Trojan and it was automatically removed, preventing Pegasus Mail from running. Norton AntiVirus had falsely identified three releases of Pegasus Mail as malware, and would delete the Pegasus Mail installer file when that happened. In response to this Pegasus Mail stated:
* April 2010: McAfee VirusScan detected svchost.exe, a normal Windows binary, as a virus on machines running Windows XP with Service Pack 3, causing a reboot loop and loss of all network access.
* December 2010: a faulty update on the AVG anti-virus suite damaged 64-bit versions of Windows 7, rendering it unable to boot, due to an endless boot loop created.
* October 2011: Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) removed the Google Chrome web browser, rival to Microsoft&#x27;s own Internet Explorer. MSE flagged Chrome as a Zbot banking trojan.
* September 2012: Sophos&#x27; anti-virus suite identified various update-mechanisms, including its own, as malware. If it was configured to automatically delete detected files, Sophos Antivirus could render itself unable to update, required manual intervention to fix the problem.
* September 2017: the Google Play Protect anti-virus started identifying Motorola&#x27;s Moto G4 Bluetooth application as malware, causing Bluetooth functionality to become disabled.
* September 2022: Microsoft Defender flagged all Chromium based web browsers and Electron based apps like WhatsApp, Discord, Spotify as a severe threat.

=== System and interoperability related issues ===
Running (the real-time protection of) multiple antivirus programs concurrently can degrade performance and create conflicts. However, using a concept called multiscanning, several companies (including G Data Software and Microsoft) have created applications which can run multiple engines concurrently.

It is sometimes necessary to temporarily disable virus protection when installing major updates such as Windows Service Packs or updating graphics card drivers. Active antivirus protection may partially or completely prevent the installation of a major update. Anti-virus software can cause problems during the installation of an operating system upgrade, e.g. when upgrading to a newer version of Windows &quot;in place&quot;—without erasing the previous version of Windows. Microsoft recommends that anti-virus software be disabled to avoid conflicts with the upgrade installation process. Active anti-virus software can also interfere with a firmware update process.

The functionality of a few computer programs can be hampered by active anti-virus software. For example, TrueCrypt, a disk encryption program, states on its troubleshooting page that anti-virus programs can conflict with TrueCrypt and cause it to malfunction or operate very slowly. Anti-virus software can impair the performance and stability of games running in the Steam platform.

Support issues also exist around antivirus application interoperability with common solutions like SSL VPN remote access and network access control products. These technology solutions often have policy assessment applications that require an up-to-date antivirus to be installed and running. If the antivirus application is not recognized by the policy assessment, whether because the antivirus application has been updated or because it is not part of the policy assessment library, the user will be unable to connect.

===Effectiveness===
Studies in December 2007 showed that the effectiveness of antivirus software had decreased in the previous year, particularly against unknown or zero day attacks. The computer magazine &quot;c&#x27;t&quot; found that detection rates for these threats had dropped from 40 to 50% in 2006 to 20–30% in 2007. At that time, the only exception was the NOD32 antivirus, which managed a detection rate of 68%. According to the &quot;ZeuS tracker&quot; website the average detection rate for all variants of the ZeuS trojan is as low as 40%.

The problem is magnified by the changing intent of virus authors. Some years ago it was obvious when a virus infection was present. At the time, viruses were written by amateurs and exhibited destructive behavior or pop-ups. Modern viruses are often written by professionals, financed by criminal organizations.

In 2008, Eva Chen, CEO of Trend Micro, stated that the anti-virus industry has over-hyped how effective its products are—and so has been misleading customers—for years.

Independent testing on all the major virus scanners consistently shows that none provides 100% virus detection. The best ones provided as high as 99.9% detection for simulated real-world situations, while the lowest provided 91.1% in tests conducted in August 2013. Many virus scanners produce false positive results as well, identifying benign files as malware.

Although methods may differ, some notable independent quality testing agencies include AV-Comparatives, ICSA Labs, SE Labs, West Coast Labs, &quot;Virus Bulletin&quot;, AV-TEST and other members of the Anti-Malware Testing Standards Organization.

===New viruses===
Anti-virus programs are not always effective against new viruses, even those that use non-signature-based methods that should detect new viruses. The reason for this is that the virus designers test their new viruses on the major anti-virus applications to make sure that they are not detected before releasing them into the wild.

Some new viruses, particularly ransomware, use polymorphic code to avoid detection by virus scanners. Jerome Segura, a security analyst with ParetoLogic, explained:

A proof of concept virus has used the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to avoid detection from anti-virus software. The potential success of this involves bypassing the CPU in order to make it much harder for security researchers to analyse the inner workings of such malware.

=== Rootkits ===
Detecting rootkits is a major challenge for anti-virus programs. Rootkits have full administrative access to the computer and are invisible to users and hidden from the list of running processes in the task manager. Rootkits can modify the inner workings of the operating system and tamper with antivirus programs.

=== Damaged files ===
If a file has been infected by a computer virus, anti-virus software will attempt to remove the virus code from the file during disinfection, but it is not always able to restore the file to its undamaged state. In such circumstances, damaged files can only be restored from existing backups or shadow copies (this is also true for ransomware); installed software that is damaged requires re-installation (however, see System File Checker).

=== Firmware infections ===
Any writeable firmware in the computer can be infected by malicious code. This is a major concern, as an infected BIOS could require the actual BIOS chip to be replaced to ensure the malicious code is completely removed. Anti-virus software is not effective at protecting firmware and the motherboard BIOS from infection. In 2014, security researchers discovered that USB devices contain writeable firmware which can be modified with malicious code (dubbed &quot;BadUSB&quot;), which anti-virus software cannot detect or prevent. The malicious code can run undetected on the computer and could even infect the operating system prior to it booting up.

== Performance and other drawbacks ==
Antivirus software has some drawbacks, first of which that it can impact a computer&#x27;s performance.

Furthermore, inexperienced users can be lulled into a false sense of security when using the computer, considering their computers to be invulnerable, and may have problems understanding the prompts and decisions that antivirus software presents them with. An incorrect decision may lead to a security breach. If the antivirus software employs heuristic detection, it must be fine-tuned to minimize misidentifying harmless software as malicious (false positive).

Antivirus software itself usually runs at the highly trusted kernel level of the operating system to allow it access to all the potential malicious process and files, creating a potential avenue of attack. The US National Security Agency (NSA) and the UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) intelligence agencies, 
respectively, have been exploiting anti-virus software to spy on users. Anti-virus software has highly privileged and trusted access to the underlying operating system, which makes it a much more appealing target for remote attacks. Additionally anti-virus software is &quot;years behind security-conscious client-side applications like browsers or document readers. It means that Acrobat Reader, Microsoft Word or Google Chrome are harder to exploit than 90 percent of the anti-virus products out there&quot;, according to Joxean Koret, a researcher with Coseinc, a Singapore-based information security consultancy.

== Alternative solutions ==
Antivirus software running on individual computers is the most common method employed of guarding against malware, but it is not the only solution. Other solutions can also be employed by users, including Unified Threat Management (UTM), hardware and network firewalls, Cloud-based antivirus and online scanners.

=== Hardware and network firewall ===
Network firewalls prevent unknown programs and processes from accessing the system. However, they are not antivirus systems and make no attempt to identify or remove anything. They may protect against infection from outside the protected computer or network, and limit the activity of any malicious software which is present by blocking incoming or outgoing requests on certain TCP/IP ports. A firewall is designed to deal with broader system threats that come from network connections into the system and is not an alternative to a virus protection system.

=== Cloud antivirus ===
Cloud antivirus is a technology that uses lightweight agent software on the protected computer, while offloading the majority of data analysis to the provider&#x27;s infrastructure.

One approach to implementing cloud antivirus involves scanning suspicious files using multiple antivirus engines. This approach was proposed by an early implementation of the cloud antivirus concept called CloudAV. CloudAV was designed to send programs or documents to a network cloud where multiple antivirus and behavioral detection programs are used simultaneously in order to improve detection rates. Parallel scanning of files using potentially incompatible antivirus scanners is achieved by spawning a virtual machine per detection engine and therefore eliminating any possible issues. CloudAV can also perform &quot;retrospective detection&quot;, whereby the cloud detection engine rescans all files in its file access history when a new threat is identified thus improving new threat detection speed. Finally, CloudAV is a solution for effective virus scanning on devices that lack the computing power to perform the scans themselves.

Some examples of cloud anti-virus products are Panda Cloud Antivirus and Immunet. Comodo Group has also produced cloud-based anti-virus.

=== Online scanning ===
Some antivirus vendors maintain websites with free online scanning capability of the entire computer, critical areas only, local disks, folders or files. Periodic online scanning is a good idea for those that run antivirus applications on their computers because those applications are frequently slow to catch threats. One of the first things that malicious software does in an attack is disable any existing antivirus software and sometimes the only way to know of an attack is by turning to an online resource that is not installed on the infected computer.

=== Specialized tools ===
Virus removal tools are available to help remove stubborn infections or a certain type of infection. Examples include &quot;Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool&quot;, &quot;Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool&quot;, and &quot;Sophos Scan &amp; Clean&quot;. It is also worth noting that sometimes antivirus software can produce a false-positive result, indicating an infection where there is none.

A rescue disk that is bootable, such as a CD or USB storage device, can be used to run antivirus software outside of the installed operating system in order to remove infections while they are dormant. A bootable rescue disk can be useful when, for example, the installed operating system is no longer bootable or has malware that is resisting all attempts to be removed by the installed antivirus software. Examples of software that can be used on a bootable rescue disk include the &quot;Kaspersky Rescue Disk&quot;, &quot;Trend Micro Rescue Disk&quot;, and &quot;Comodo Rescue Disk&quot;.

== Usage and risks ==
According to an FBI survey, major businesses lose $12 million annually dealing with virus incidents. A survey by Symantec in 2009 found that a third of small to medium-sized business did not use antivirus protection at that time, whereas more than 80% of home users had some kind of antivirus installed. According to a sociological survey conducted by G Data Software in 2010 49% of women did not use any antivirus program at all.

<doc id="268647" wikidata="Q26635" url="?curid=268647" title="Greater scaup">
<text>The greater scaup (Aythya marila), just scaup in Europe or, colloquially, &quot;bluebill&quot; in North America, is a mid-sized diving duck, larger than the closely related lesser scaup and tufted duck. It spends the summer months breeding in Iceland, east across Scandinavia, northern Russia and Siberia, Alaska, and northern Canada. During the winter, it migrates south to the coasts of Europe, eastern Asia, and North America.

Drake greater scaup are larger and have more rounded heads than the females; they have a bright blue bill and yellow eyes. Their heads are dark, with a green to purple (depending on light angle) gloss; the breast is black, the belly white, the upperparts pale grey, and the wing shows a strong white stripe. The females are mostly brown, again with white on the wing. They have dull blue bills and a white patch on the face.

Greater scaup nest near water, typically on islands in northern lakes or on floating mats of vegetation. They begin breeding at age two, but start building nests in the first year. The drakes have a complex courtship, which takes place on the return migration to the summer breeding grounds and concludes with the formation of monogamous pairs. Females lay a clutch of six to nine olive-buff-coloured eggs. The eggs hatch in 24 to 28 days. The down-covered ducklings are able to follow their mother in her search for food immediately after hatching.

Greater scaup eat aquatic molluscs, plants, and insects, which they obtain by diving underwater to depths of 0.5–6 m, exceptionally 10 m. They form large groups, called &quot;rafts&quot;, that can number in the thousands. Their main threat is human development, although they are also preyed upon by owls, skunks, raccoons, foxes, coyotes, and humans. Greater scaup populations have been declining since the 1980s; however, they are still listed as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List.

==Taxonomy==

The greater scaup was formally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1761 under the binomial name &quot;Anas marila&quot;. The type locality is Lapland. The species is now placed in the genus &quot;Aythya&quot; that was introduced for the greater scaup by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1822.

The genus name &quot;Aythya&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;aithuia&quot; which refers to a seabird mentioned by Aristotle and others and is thought to refer to a seaduck or other seabird. The species name &quot;marila&quot; is from the Greek word for charcoal embers or coal dust.
Two subspecies of Greater scaup are currently accepted. The nominate &quot;A. m. marila&quot; is found from northern Europe to east Siberia, west of the Lena river. The birds in North America are treated as a separate subspecies &quot;A. m. nearctica&quot;, and are distinguishable from those in Europe by a typically higher forehead, and the male having stronger vermiculations on the mantle and scapulars. Additionally, there is less extensive white on the primary feathers than &quot;A. m. marila&quot;. Greater Scaup of far eastern Asia (east of the Lena River towards the Bering Sea) are intermediate between the two subspecies and sometimes lumped with either race, or a distinct subspecies &quot;A. m. mariloides&quot;, though the latter name is invalid, as it was first used to describe the lesser scaup &quot;A. affinis&quot;. Based on size differences, a Pleistocene paleosubspecies, &quot;Aythya marila asphaltica&quot;, has also been described by Serebrovskij in 1941 from fossils recovered at Binagady, Azerbaijan. A phylogenetic analysis of the diving ducks, examining the skeletal anatomy and skin, found that the greater and lesser scaups are each other&#x27;s closest relatives, with the tufted duck as the next closest relative of the pair.

The greater scaup&#x27;s English name, first attested as &#x27;Scaup Duck&#x27; in 1678, most likely comes from &quot;scaup&quot; or &quot;scalp&quot;, a Scottish and Northern English word for a shellfish bed, where the birds typically feed in winter. but could also be from the duck&#x27;s mating call: &quot;scaup scaup&quot;.

==Description==
The adult greater scaup is long with a wingspan and a weight of . It has a light blue bill with a small black nail on the tip, yellow eyes, and is 20% heavier and 10% longer than the closely related lesser scaup. The male has a dark head with a green to purple sheen, a black breast, a light back, a black tail, and a white underside. The drake or male is larger and has a more rounded head than the female. The drake&#x27;s belly and flanks are a bright white. Its neck, breast, and tail feathers are glossy black, while its lower flanks are vermiculated grey. The upper wing has a white stripe starting as the speculum and extending along the flight feathers to the wingtip. Legs and feet of both sexes are grey. 

The adult female has a brown body and head, with white wing markings similar to those of the male but slightly duller. It has a white band and brown oval shaped patches at the base of the bill, which is a slightly duller shade of blue than the drake&#x27;s. Juvenile greater scaup look similar to adult females. The drake&#x27;s eclipse plumage looks similar to its breeding plumage, except the pale parts of the plumage are a buffy grey. 

Distinguishing greater from lesser scaups can be difficult in the field. The head of the greater tends to be more rounded, and the white wing stripe is more extensive. The bill is also tends to be larger and wider, with a slightly larger black nail at the tip. The North American subspecies &quot;A. m. nearctica&quot; typically has a higher forehead and reduced white on the wings, intermediate between the European &quot;A. m. marila&quot; and Lesser Scaup.

==Distribution and habitat==
The greater scaup has a circumpolar distribution, breeding within the Arctic Circle both in the Old World (the Palearctic) and in North America (the Nearctic). It spends the summer months in Iceland, east across Scandinavia, northern Russia and Siberia, Alaska, and northern Canada. It is mostly migratory, but small numbers are present in Iceland and the Aleutian Islands year round. The summer habitat is marshy lowland tundra and islands in fresh water lakes. In the autumn, greater scaup populations start their migration south for the winter. They winter along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of North America, the coasts of northwest Europe, the Caspian Sea, the Black Sea, the coast of Japan, Yellow Sea and East China Sea. During the winter months, they are found in coastal bays, estuaries, and sometimes inland lakes, such as the lakes of Central Europe and the Great Lakes.

In Europe, the greater scaup breeds in Iceland, the northern coasts of the Scandinavian peninsula, including much of the northern parts of the Baltic Sea, the higher mountains of Scandinavia and the areas close to the Arctic Sea in Russia. It has also bred sporadically in northern Scotland. These birds spend the winters in the British Isles, western Norway, the southern tip of Sweden, the coast from Brittany to Poland, including all of Denmark, the Alps, the eastern Adriatic Sea, the northern and western Black sea and the southwestern Caspian Sea.

In North America, the greater scaup summers in Newfoundland and Labrador, Ungava Bay, Hudson Bay, Lake Winnipeg, northern Yukon, northern Manitoba, and northern Saskatchewan. It winters along the coasts of North America from northern British Columbia south to the Baja Peninsula and from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick south to Florida, as well as the shores of the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico.

==Behaviour==

===Breeding===

Greater scaup breed in the tundra and the boreal forest; it is estimated that 75% of the North American population breed in Alaska. They typically nest on islands in large northern lakes. Greater scaup begin breeding when they are two years old, although they may start nesting at age one. Drake greater scaup have a soft, quick whistle they use to attract the attention of hens during courtship, which takes place from late winter to early spring, on the way back to their northern breeding grounds. Female greater scaup have a single pitch, a raspy &quot;arrr-arrr-arrr-arrr-arrr&quot; call note. The courtship is complex and results in the formation of monogamous pairs. 

Pairs nest in close proximity to each other in large colonies, usually near water, on an island or shoreline, or on a raft of floating vegetation. The nest consists of a shallow depression made by the female and lined with her down. After the female lays the eggs, the drake abandons the female and goes with other drakes to a large, isolated lake to moult. These lakes can be close to the breeding grounds, or distant, with birds performing a moult migration of up to several hundred km, such as from northern Scandinavia to the IJsselmeer in the Netherlands. The lakes chosen are used yearly by the same ducks. The optimal moulting lake is fairly shallow and has an abundance of food sources and cover. 

The female lays six to nine olive-buff-coloured eggs, which she incubates for 24–28 days. A larger clutch could indicate brood parasitism by other greater scaups or even ducks of other species. The newly hatched ducklings are covered with down and are soon able to walk, swim, and feed themselves; however, they are not able to fly until 40–45 days after hatching. The vulnerable small ducklings follow their mother, who protects them from predators.

===Feeding===

The greater scaup dive to obtain food, which they eat on the surface. They mainly eat molluscs, aquatic plants, and aquatic insects. During the summer months, the greater scaup will eat small aquatic crustaceans. There is a report of four greater scaups in April near Chicago swallowing hibernating leopard frogs (a species with a body length about 5 centimetres, or 2.0 in), which they dredged out of a roadside freshwater pond. In freshwater ecosystems, the greater scaup will eat seeds, leaves, stems and roots, along with sedges, pondweeds, muskgrass, and American eelgrass. Owing to the greater scaup&#x27;s webbed feet and weight, it can dive up to and stay submerged for up to a minute. In the past, they also often fed in winter in huge flocks on spent grain pumped offshore from distilleries (notably in the Firth of Forth in Scotland), but with modern pollution control, this food source is no longer available.

==Threats==

Common predators of the greater scaup are owls, foxes, skunks, raccoons, coyotes, and humans. Greater scaup often find themselves entangled in fishing nets, thus large numbers of them drown in nets each year. Greater scaup can catch avian influenza, so future outbreaks have the potential to threaten greater scaup populations.

Although the greater scaup faces numerous threats, the most significant challenge to their survival is habitat degradation caused by a mix of human development and runoff. Greater scaup, when moulting and during the winter, are threatened by escalated levels of organochloride contaminants. Oil and sewage pollution also threaten this duck. Since 80% of the greater scaup population winters in the urbanised part of the Atlantic Flyway, these ducks are subject to high levels of organic contaminates, along with increased levels of heavy metals in foods and habitat.

A joint group of American and Canadian scientists researching scaup migration across the Great Lakes found that 100% of female greater scaup, and 77% of female lesser scaup, had escalated levels of selenium in their bodies. Selenium is an occurring semimetallic trace element that occurs naturally in some soils and minute amounts are necessary for animal life. However excessive selenium can cause reproductive harm and is highly toxic. On their migration across the Great Lakes, greater scaups are at risk of ingesting selenium by eating the invasive zebra mussels, which can render the female infertile. This sterilization of females is causing the population to decrease.

In a study of 107 scaup, they all had traces of iron, zinc, manganese, copper, lead, cadmium, cobalt and nickel in their tissue samples with varying concentrations of metals in different types of tissues. Further analysis revealed that the kidneys had the highest levels of cadmium, the liver had the highest levels of copper and manganese, the liver and the stomach had the highest levels of zinc, and the lungs and liver had the highest levels of iron. There was no difference in concentration when comparing sexes.

==Conservation==
Greater scaup are rated as a species of least concern by the IUCN Redlist. During aerial population surveys greater and lesser scaup are counted together, because they look almost identical from the air. It was estimated that the greater scaup made up about 11% of the continental scaup population. Since the 1980s, scaup populations have been steadily decreasing. Some of the primary factors contributing to this decline are habitat loss, contaminants, changes in breeding habitat, and a lower female survival rate. The 2010 American scaup population survey was 4.2 million scaup, however, the worldwide greater scaup population survey estimated 1,200,000 to 1,400,000 mature greater scaup. Along with the aerial population surveys, there is a ringing programme for the greater scaup. Metal leg bands are placed on them, so that if the scaup is killed by a hunter or if it is captured by another ringing group, the number on the band can be reported to biologists and wildlife organisations. These ringing programmes yield valuable data about migration patterns, harvest rates, and survival rates.

==Human interactions==
Greater scaup are a popular game bird in North America and Europe. They are hunted in Denmark, Germany, Greece, France, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, and in Iran for both sport and commercial reasons. Greater scaup are hunted with shotguns because they must be shot on the fly, a challenging task, as they can fly at up to . Greater scaup are hunted from shorelines and in open water hunting blinds or layout boats, low-profile kayak-like boats that hunters lie inside. Hunters frequently use decoys to attract the birds, often arranged to simulate a raft of greater scaup and featuring an open area to attract the birds to land.

<text>A riddle is a statement, question, or phrase having a double or veiled meaning, put forth as a puzzle to be solved. Riddles are of two types: &quot;enigmas&quot;, which are problems generally expressed in metaphorical or allegorical language that require ingenuity and careful thinking for their solution, and &quot;conundra&quot;, which are questions relying for their effects on punning in either the question or the answer.

Archer Taylor says that &quot;we can probably say that riddling is a universal art&quot; and cites riddles from hundreds of different cultures including Finnish, Hungarian, American Indian, Chinese, Russian, Dutch, and Filipino sources amongst many others. Many riddles and riddle-themes are internationally widespread.

In the assessment of Elli Köngäs-Maranda (originally writing about Malaitian riddles, but with an insight that has been taken up more widely), whereas myths serve to encode and establish social norms, &quot;riddles make a point of playing with conceptual boundaries and crossing them for the intellectual pleasure of showing that things are not quite as stable as they seem&quot; — though the point of doing so may still ultimately be to &quot;play with boundaries, but ultimately to affirm them&quot;.

==Definitions and research==

===Etymology===
The modern English word &quot;riddle&quot; shares its origin with the word &quot;read&quot;, both stemming from the Common Germanic verb *&quot;rēdaną&quot;, which meant &#x27;to interpret, guess&#x27;. From this verb came the West Germanic noun *&quot;rādislī&quot;, literally meaning &#x27;thing to be guessed, thing to be interpreted&#x27;. From this comes Dutch &quot;raadsel&quot;, German &quot;Rätsel&quot;, and Old English *&quot;rǣdels&quot;, the latter of which became modern English &quot;riddle&quot;.

===Definitions===

Defining riddles precisely is hard and has attracted a fair amount of scholarly debate. The first major modern attempt to define the riddle in modern Western scholarship was by Robert Petsch in 1899, with another seminal contribution, inspired by structuralism, by Robert A. Georges and Alan Dundes in 1963. Georges and Dundes suggested that &quot;a riddle is a traditional verbal expression which contains one or more descriptive elements, a pair of which may be in opposition; the referent of the elements is to be guessed&quot;. There are many possible sub-sets of the riddle, including charades, droodles, and some jokes.

In some traditions and contexts, riddles may overlap with proverbs. For example, the Russian phrase &quot;Nothing hurts it, but it groans all the time&quot; can be deployed as a proverb (when its referent is a hypochondriac) or as a riddle (when its referent is a pig).

===Research===

Much academic research on riddles has focused on collecting, cataloguing, defining, and typologising riddles. Key work on cataloguing and typologising riddles was published by Antti Aarne in 1918–20, and by Archer Taylor. In the case of ancient riddles recorded without solutions, considerable scholarly energy also goes into proposing and debating solutions.

Whereas previously researchers had tended to take riddles out of their social performance contexts, the rise of anthropology in the post-War period encouraged more researchers to study the social role of riddles and riddling, highlighting their role of re-orienting reality in the face of fear and anxiety. However, wide-ranging studies of riddles have tended to be limited to Western countries, with Asian and African riddles being relatively neglected.

Riddles have also attracted linguists, often studying riddles from the point of view of semiotics; meanwhile, the twenty-first century has seen the rise of extensive work on medieval European riddles from the point of view of eco-criticism, exploring how riddles can inform us about people&#x27;s conceptualisation and exploration of their environment.

==International riddles==

Many riddles appear in similar form across many countries, and often continents. Borrowing of riddles happens both on a local scale, and across great distances. Kofi Dorvlo gives an example of a riddle that has been borrowed from the Ewe language by speakers of the neighboring Logba language: &quot;This woman has not been to the riverside for water, but there is water in her tank&quot;. The answer is &quot;a coconut&quot;. On a much wider scale, the Riddle of the Sphinx has also been documented in the Marshall Islands, possibly carried there by Western contacts in the last two centuries.

Key examples of internationally widespread riddles follow, based on the classic (European-focused) study by Antti Aarne.

=== Writing-riddle ===
The basic form of the writing-riddle is &#x27;White field, black seeds&#x27;, where the field is a page and the seeds are letters. An example is the eighth- or ninth-century Veronese Riddle:

Here, the oxen are the scribe&#x27;s finger(s) and thumb, and the plough is the pen. Among literary riddles, riddles on the pen and other writing equipment are particularly widespread.

=== Year-riddle ===
The year-riddle is found across Eurasia. For example, a riddle in the Sanskrit &quot;Rig Veda&quot;, from around 1500–1000 BCE, describes a &#x27;twelve-spoked wheel, upon which stand 720 sons of one birth&#x27; (i.e. the twelve months of the year, which together supposedly have 360 days and 360 nights).

=== Person-riddle ===
The most famous example of this type is the riddle of the Sphinx. This Estonian example shows the pattern:

The riddle describes a crawling baby, a standing person, and an old person with a walking stick.

=== Two-legs, three-legs, and four-legs ===
This type includes riddles along the lines of this German example:

The conceit here is that Two-legs is a person, Three-legs is a three-legged stool, Four-legs is a dog, and One-leg is a ham hock.

=== Four Hang; Two Point the Way ===
An example of Four Hang; Two Point the Way, to which the pre-eminent solution is &#x27;cow&#x27; is given here in thirteenth-century Icelandic form:

The cow has four teats, four legs, two horns, two back legs, and one tail.

=== Featherless bird-riddle ===
The featherless bird-riddle is best known in Central Europe. An English version is:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em&quot;&gt;
White bird featherless
Flew from Paradise,
Perched upon the castle wall;
Up came Lord John landless,
Took it up handless,
And rode away horseless to the King&#x27;s white hall.&lt;/poem&gt;
Here, a snowflake falls from the sky, and is blown off by the wind.

==Riddle-traditions by region==
The riddle was at times a prominent literary form in the ancient and medieval world, so riddles are extensively, if patchily, attested in our written records from these periods. More recently, riddles have been collected from oral tradition by scholars in many parts of the world.

===Babylon===

According to Archer Taylor, &quot;the oldest recorded riddles are Babylonian school texts which show no literary polish&quot;. The answers to the riddles are not preserved; the riddles include &quot;my knees hasten, my feet do not rest, a shepherd without pity drives me to pasture&quot; (a river? A rowboat?); &quot;you went and took the enemy&#x27;s property; the enemy came and took your property&quot; (a weaving shuttle?); &quot;who becomes pregnant without conceiving, who becomes fat without eating?&quot; (a raincloud?). These may be riddles from oral tradition that a teacher has put into a schoolbook.

=== South Asia ===

It is thought that the world&#x27;s earliest surviving poetic riddles survive in the Sanskrit &quot;Rigveda&quot;. of the first book of the &quot;Rigveda&quot; can be understood to comprise a series of riddles or enigmas which are now obscure but may have been an enigmatic exposition of the pravargya ritual. These riddles overlap in significant part with a collection of forty-seven in the Atharvaveda; riddles also appear elsewhere in Vedic texts. Taylor cited the following example: &#x27;&quot;Who moves in the air? Who makes a noise on seeing a thief? Who is the enemy of lotuses? Who is the climax of fury?&quot; The answers to the first three questions, when combined in the manner of a charade, yield the answer to the fourth question. The first answer is bird (&quot;vi&quot;), the second dog (&quot;śvā&quot;), the third sun (&quot;mitra&quot;), and the whole is Vishvamitra, Rama&#x27;s first teacher and counselor and a man noted for his outbursts of rage&#x27;.

Accordingly, riddles are treated in early studies of Sanskrit poetry such as Daṇḍin&#x27;s seventh- or eighth-century &quot;Kāvyādarśa&quot;.

Early narrative literature also sometimes includes riddles, prominently the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, which for example contains the Yaksha Prashna, a series of riddles posed by a nature-spirit (&quot;yaksha&quot;) to Yudhishthira.

The first riddle collection in a medieval Indic language is traditionally thought to be the riddles of Amir Khusrow (1253–1325), which are written in Hindawi, in verse, in the mātrika metre.

As of the 1970s, folklorists had not undertaken extensive collecting of riddles in India, but riddling was known to be thriving as a form of folk-literature, sometimes in verse. Riddles have also been collected in Tamil.

===Hebrew, Arabic and Persian===
While riddles are not numerous in the Bible, they are present, most famously in Samson&#x27;s riddle in Judges xiv.14, but also in I Kings 10:1–13 (where the Queen of Sheba tests Solomon&#x27;s wisdom), and in the Talmud. Sirach also mentions riddles as a popular dinner pastime, while the Aramaic &quot;Story of Ahikar&quot; contains a long section of proverbial wisdom that in some versions also contains riddles. Otherwise, riddles are sparse in ancient Semitic writing.

In the medieval period, however, verse riddles, alongside other puzzles and conundra, became a significant literary form in the Arabic-speaking world, and accordingly in Islamic Persian culture and in Hebrew — particularly in Al-Andalus. Since early Arabic and Persian poetry often features rich, metaphorical description, and ekphrasis, there is a natural overlap in style and approach between poetry generally and riddles specifically; literary riddles are therefore often a subset of the descriptive poetic form known in both traditions as &quot;wasf&quot;. Riddles are attested in anthologies of poetry and in prosimetrical portrayals of riddle-contests in Arabic &quot;maqāmāt&quot; and in Persian epics such as the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;. Meanwhile, in Hebrew, Dunash ben Labrat (920–990), credited with transposing Arabic metres into Hebrew, composed a number of riddles, mostly apparently inspired by folk-riddles. Other Hebrew-writing exponents included Moses ibn Ezra, Yehuda Alharizi, Judah Halevi, Immanuel the Roman, and Israel Onceneyra.

In both Arabic and Persian, riddles seem to have become increasingly scholarly in style over time, increasingly emphasising riddles and puzzles in which the interpreter has to resolve clues to letters and numbers to put together the word which is the riddle&#x27;s solution.

Riddles have been collected by modern scholars throughout the Arabic-speaking world.

=== Europe ===

==== Greek ====

Riddles are known to have been popular in Greece in Hellenistic times, and possibly before; they were prominent among the entertainments and challenges presented at symposia. Oracles were also represented as speaking in often riddlic language. However, the first significant corpus of Greek riddles survives in an anthology of earlier material known as the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot;, which contains about 50 verse riddles, probably put into its present form by Constantine Cephalas, working in the tenth century CE. Most surviving ancient Greek riddles are in verse. In the second chapter of Book III of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, the philosopher stated that &quot;good riddles do, in general, provide us with satisfactory metaphors: for metaphors imply riddles, and therefore a good riddle can furnish a good metaphor.&quot;

Literary riddles were also composed in Byzantium, from perhaps the tenth century with the work of John Geometres, into the fifteenth century, along with a neo-Byzantine revival in around the early eighteenth century. There was a particular peak around the long twelfth century.

==== Latin and romance ====
Two Latin riddles are preserved as graffiti in the Basilica at Pompeii. The pre-eminent collection of ancient Latin riddles is a collection of 100 hexametrical riddles by Symphosius which were influential on later medieval Latin writers. The Bern Riddles, a collection of Latin riddles clearly modelled on Symphosius, were composed in the early seventh century by an unknown author, perhaps in northern Italy. Symphosius&#x27;s collection also inspired a number of Anglo-Saxon riddlers who wrote in Latin. They remained influential in medieval Castilian tradition, being the basis for the second set of riddles in the thirteenth-century &quot;Libro de Apolonio&quot;, posed by Apolonio&#x27;s daughter Tarsiana to her father.

The perhaps eighth- or ninth-century Veronese Riddle is a key witness to the linguistic transition from Latin to Romance, but riddles are otherwise rare in medieval romance languages. However, in the early modern period, printed riddle collections were published in French, including the &quot;Adevineaux amoureux&quot; (printed in Bruges by Colard Mansion around 1479); and &quot;Demandes joyeuses en maniere de quolibets&quot;, the basis for Wynkyn de Worde&#x27;s 1511 &quot;Demaundes Joyous&quot;.

==== The Germanic-speaking world ====

Riddles survive only fragmentarily in Old High German: three, very short, possible examples exist in manuscripts from the Monastery of St Gallen, but, while certainly cryptic, they are not necessarily riddles in a strict sense. About 150 survive in Middle High German, mostly quoted in other literary contexts. Likewise, riddles are rare in Old Norse: almost all occur in one section of &quot;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks&quot;, in which the god Óðinn propounds around 37 riddles (depending on the manuscript). These riddles do, however, provide insights into Norse mythology, medieval Scandinavian social norms, and rarely attested poetic forms.

By contrast, verse riddles were prominent in early medieval England, following the seminal composition of one hundred and one riddles by Aldhelm (c. 639–709), written in Latin and inspired by the fourth- or fifth-century Latin poet Symphosius. Aldhelm was followed by a number of other Anglo-Saxons writing riddles in Latin. This prestigious literary heritage contextualises the survival of nearly one hundred riddles in the tenth-century Exeter Book, one of the main surviving collections of Old English verse. The riddles in this book vary in subject matter from ribald innuendo to theological sophistication. Three, Exeter Book Riddle 35 and Riddles 40/66, are in origin translations of riddles by Aldhelm (and Riddle 35 the only Old English riddle to be attested in another manuscript besides the Exeter Book). Unlike the pithy three-line riddles of Symphosius, the Old English riddles tend to be discursive, often musing on complex processes of manufacture when describing artefacts such as mead (Exeter Book Riddle 27) or a reed-pen or -pipe (Exeter Book Riddle 60). They are noted for providing perspectives on the world which give voice to actors which tend not to appear in Old English poetry, ranging from female slaves to animals and plants. In addition, they often subvert the conventions of Old English heroic and religious poetry.

While medieval records of Germanic-language riddles are patchy, with the advent of print in the West, collections of riddles and similar kinds of questions began to be published. A large number of riddle collections were printed in the German-speaking world and, partly under German influence, in Scandinavia. Riddles were evidently hugely popular in Germany: a recent research project uncovered more than 100,000 early modern German riddles, with the most important collection being that &quot;Strassburger Rätselbuch&quot;, first published around 1500 and many times reprinted. This is one of the most famous riddles of that time:

That is, &quot;the snow (featherless bird) lies on a bare tree in winter (leafless tree), and the sun (speechless maiden) causes the snow to melt (ate the featherless bird)&quot;.

Likewise, early modern English-speakers published printed riddle collections, such as the 1598 &quot;Riddles of Heraclitus and Democritus&quot;, which includes for example the following riddle:&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em&quot;&gt;
First I was small, and round like a pearl;
Then long and slender, as brave as an earl;
Since, like an hermit, I lived in a cell,
And now, like a rogue, in the wide world I dwell.
&lt;/poem&gt;
After the early Middle Ages, the riddle was seldom used as a literary form in English. Tellingly, while Jonathan Swift composed at least eight verse riddles on themes such as a pen, gold, and the privy, this was seen as a lapse in taste by many of his contemporaries. However, although riddles are seldom used today as a literary form in their own right, they have arguably influenced the approach to poetry of a number of twentieth-century poets, such as Francis Ponge, Wallace Stevens, Richard Wilbur, Rainer M. Rilke, and Henrikas Radauskas. The famed Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote &quot;All is a riddle, and the key to a riddle ... is another riddle&quot;.

Riddles continued to flourish until recently as an oral form of entertainment, however; the seminal collection of Anglophone riddles from the early modern period through to the twentieth century is Archer Taylor&#x27;s. Riddles are, for example, prominent in some early-modern ballads collected from oral tradition. Some of those included in the Child Ballads are &quot;Riddles Wisely Expounded&quot; (Child 1), &quot;The Elfin Knight&quot; (Child 2), &quot;King John and the Bishop&quot; (Child 45), &quot;Captain Wedderburn&#x27;s Courtship&quot; (Child 46), and &quot;Proud Lady Margaret&quot; (Child 47). Contemporary English-language riddles typically use puns and double entendres for humorous effect, rather than to puzzle the butt of the joke, as in &quot;Why is six afraid of seven?&quot; &quot;Because seven eight nine (eight can be replaced with ate).&quot; These riddles are now mostly children&#x27;s humour and games rather than literary compositions.

Some riddles are composed of foreign words and play on similar sounds, as in:

:&quot;There were two cats, one two three cat and un deux trois cat. They had a swimming race from England to France. Who won?&quot;
:&quot;One two three cat, because un deux trois quatre cinq (un deux trois cat sank).&quot;

This plays on the fact that the French words for four and five are pronounced similarly to the English words &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;sank&quot;.

====The Celtic-speaking world====

Few riddles are attested in medieval Celtic languages, though this depends on how narrowly a riddle is defined; some early medieval Welsh and Irish juridical texts have been read as being riddles. One undisputed riddle is attested in medieval Welsh, an elaborate text entitled &#x27;Canu y Gwynt&#x27; (&#x27;song of the wind&#x27;) in the fourteenth-century Book of Taliesin probably inspired by Latin riddles on the same theme. However, this record is supplemented by Latin material, apparently from a Brittonic cultural background in North Britain, about Lailoken: in a twelfth-century text, Lailoken poses three riddles to his captor King Meldred.

The earliest riddles attested in Irish are generally held to be found in a short collection from the fifteenth-century Book of Fermoy. However, other forms of wisdom contest do occur in Irish literature, such as &quot;The Colloquy of the Two Sages&quot;, first attested in twelfth-century manuscripts, and in one such contest, in &quot;Imthecht na Tromdaime&quot;, first attested in the fifteenth century, at least one riddle is arguably posed.

Even research on the post-medieval Celtic-speaking world has yielded a &quot;comparatively meagre corpus&quot;.

====The Finnic-speaking world====

The corpus of traditional riddles from the Finnic-speaking world (including the modern Finland, Estonia, and parts of Western Russia) is fairly unitary, though eastern Finnish-speaking regions show particular influence of Russian Orthodox Christianity and Slavonic riddle culture. The Finnish for &quot;riddle&quot; is &quot;arvoitus&quot; (pl. &quot;arvoitukset&quot;), related to the verb &quot;arvata&quot; (&quot;guess&quot;).

Finnic riddles are noteworthy in relation to the rest of the world&#x27;s oral riddle canon for its original imagery, their abundance of sexual riddles, and the interesting collision of influences from east and west; along with the attestation in some regions of an elaborate riddle-game. Riddles provide some of the first surviving evidence for Finnish-language literature.

===East Asia===

====China====

In modern Chinese, the standard word for &#x27;riddle&#x27; is &quot;mi&quot; (謎, literally &quot;to bewilder&quot;). Riddles are spoken of as having a &quot;mian&quot; (面, &quot;surface&quot;, the question component of the riddle), and a &quot;di&quot; (底, &quot;base&quot;, the answer component). Ancient Chinese terms for &#x27;riddle&#x27; include &quot;yin&quot; (讔) and &quot;sou&quot; (廋), which both mean &quot;hidden&quot;.

Literary riddles in China first begin to be attested in significant numbers around the second century CE.

The Chinese riddle-tradition makes much use of visual puns on Chinese characters. One example is the riddle &quot;千 里 会 千 金&quot;; these characters respectively mean &#x27;thousand kilometre meet thousand gold&#x27;.
#The first stage of solving the riddle is verbal: 
##In Chinese culture, &quot;it is said that a good horse can run thousands of kilometers per day&quot;, so &quot;千 里&quot; (thousand kilometer) is resolved as &quot;马&quot; (horse). 
##Meanwhile, because &quot;a daughter is very important in the family&quot;, in Chinese culture it is possible to resolve &quot;千 金&quot; (thousand gold) as &quot;女&quot; (daughter).
#The second stage of solving the riddle is visual: combining the radical &quot;马&quot; (horse) with the radical &quot;女&quot; (daughter) produces the character &quot;妈&quot; (mother).
Thus the answer to &quot;thousand kilometres meet thousand gold&quot; is &quot;妈&quot; (mother).

The posing and solving of riddles has long been an important part of the Chinese Lantern Festival. China also contributed a distinctive kind of riddle known in English as the &quot;kōan&quot; (), developed as a teaching technique in Zen Buddhism in the Tang dynasty (618–907). In this tradition, the answer to the riddle is to be established through years of meditation, informed by Zen thought, as part of a process of seeking enlightenment.

In the twentieth century, thousands of riddles and similar enigmas have been collected, capitalising on the large number of homophones in Chinese. Examples of folk-riddles include:

* There is a small vessel filled with sauce, one vessel holding two different kinds. (Egg)
* Washing makes it more and more dirty; it is cleaner without washing. (Water)
* When you use it you throw it away, and when you do not use it you bring it back. (Anchor)

====The Philippines====
Quite similar to its English counterpart, the riddle in the Philippines is called &quot;Bugtong&quot;. It is traditionally used during a funeral wake together with other games such as &quot;tong-its&quot; or the more popular &quot;sakla&quot;; later generations use &quot;Bugtong&quot; as a form of past time or as an activity. One peculiarity of the Filipino version is the way they start with the phrase &quot;Bugtong-bugtong&quot; before saying the riddle; usually it is common to create riddles that rhyme.

This is an example of a &quot;Tagalog&quot; &quot;Bugtong&quot;:
Further south, in Sulawesi, Indonesia, among the Pendau, riddles are also used at funeral gatherings.

===Africa===
Anthropological research in Africa has produced extensive collections of riddles over the last century or so. Riddles have been characterised as &quot;one of the most important forms of oral art in Africa&quot;; Hamnett analyzes African riddling from an anthropological viewpoint; Yoruba riddles have enjoyed a recent monograph study. Wambi Cornelius Gulere wrote his doctoral project at Makerere University, titled &quot;Riddle Performance and Societal Discourses: Lessons from Busoga&quot;. He argues for recognition of the importance of the riddling act, not merely gathering and studying lists of riddles. Grivas Muchineripi Kayange has seen African riddles as a window into African philosophy.

===The Americas===
====Native American traditions====
Riddles in the Americas are of particular interest to scholarship because it was long thought that native American cultures had no autochthonous riddle traditions (as opposed to riddles inspired by European culture, as with the twenty-two Aztec riddles collected by Bernardino de Sahagún in the sixteenth century, in the famous Florentine codex). If so, this would have suggested that riddles are not a universal art form. However, Hieronymus Lalemant gave a fairly detailed account of a riddle-contest among the Huron around 1639 as part of a healing ritual.
Someone will say, &quot;What I desire and what I am seeking is that which bears a lake within itself;&quot; and by this is intended a pumpkin or calabash. Another will say, &quot;What I ask for is seen in my eyes—it will be marked with various colors&quot;; and because the same Huron word that signifies &quot;eye&quot; also signifies &quot;glass bead&quot;, this is a clue to divine what he desires—namely, some kind of beads of this material, and of different colors.
Accordingly, during the twentieth century, progressively more substantial collections of Native American riddles were made, including from the Alaskan Athabaskans (Ten&#x27;a) people in British Columbia; Amuzgo people in Central America; and Quechua people in South America. Thus, while data remains rather thin, it seems clear that riddling did exist in the Americas independently of European culture.

====Colonial traditions====
Riddles are found extensively in the settler-colonial cultures of the Americas.

One form of riddle features in &quot;payada de contrapunto&quot; (&quot;counterpoint payada&quot;), a Rioplatense musical genre in which guitar players compete in a symbolic duel. Two guitar players challenge each other in song by asking a riddle-like question and/or answering the opponent&#x27;s questions. This is performed through several successive rounds of witty exchanges which may include banter and even insults—typically with a humorous intent. The most famous literary example of counterpoint payada comes from Martín Fierro, Part 2, Song 30, verses 6233–6838.

==Riddle-contests==
The Riddle Game is a formalized guessing game, a contest of wit and skill in which players take turns asking riddles. The player that cannot answer loses. Riddle games occur frequently in mythology and folklore as well as in popular literature.

In many cultures or contexts, people are not actually expected to guess the answers to riddles: they may be told by the riddler, or learn riddles and their answers together as they grow up. Thus riddle-contests are not the only or even necessarily the main forum for the expression of riddles.

The unsolvable riddle with which literary characters often win a riddle-contest is sometimes referred to as neck-riddle.

===In real life===

It seems that in ancient Greece, riddle-competitions were popular as an intellectual entertainment at symposia. A key source for this culture is Athenaeus.

Elaborate and unusual riddle-games took place in the culture of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Finnish-language riddles. For example, Elias Lönnrot observed customary riddle-contests in nineteenth-century Finland:
It took place without teams, but was a kind of a contest: a member of the group would be sent out of the room, the others agreed on the riddle to be posed; for three failures to divine the answer, the riddlee would have to drop out of the game, to step aside, and to &quot;buy&quot; with a token the right to participate again.

===In ancient, medieval, and folk literature===

In older texts, riddle-contests frequently provide the frame stories whereby riddles have been preserved for posterity. Such contests are a subset of wisdom contests more generally. They tend to fall into two groups: testing the wisdom of a king or other aristocrat; and testing the suitability of a suitor. Correspondingly, the Aarne–Thompson classification systems catalogue two main folktale-types including riddle-contests: AT 927, Outriddling the Judge, and AT 851, The Princess Who Can Not Solve the Riddle.

===In modern literature===
* In J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s novel &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Gollum challenges Bilbo Baggins to a riddle competition for his life. Bilbo breaks &quot;the ancient rules&quot; of the game but is able to escape with Gollum&#x27;s magic ring. Rather like in the Old Norse &quot;Heiðreks saga&quot;, although Bilbo asked more of a simple question than a riddle, by attempting to answer it rather than challenging it Gollum accepted it as a riddle; by accepting it, his loss was binding.
* In &quot;The Grey King&quot;, the third book of Susan Cooper&#x27;s fantasy sequence &quot;The Dark is Rising&quot;, Will and Bran must win a riddle game in order for Bran to claim his heritage as the Pendragon.
* In Patricia A. McKillip&#x27;s &quot;The Riddle-Master&quot; trilogy, the ancient art of riddlery is taught at the College of Caithnard – the study based on books recovered from the ruins of the School of Wizards. The riddles in the series are composed of three parts – the question, the answer, and the stricture – and are both a way of recording history and a guide to living life. Riddles play a crucial role in the series, the main protagonist, Morgon of Hed, beginning his journey by winning the crown of the kings of Aum in a Riddle Game with the ancient ghost of Peven of Aum; Peven had a standing wager going that no one could win a riddle-game with him, and those who lost against him forfeited their lives. &quot;Beware the unanswered riddle.&quot;
* In Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands&quot; and &quot;The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass&quot;, the ka-tet must riddle against Blaine the Mono in order to save their lives. At first Blaine can answer all riddles posed to him by the ka-tet easily, but then Eddie Dean, one of the ka-tet, gains the upper hand when he starts to ask joke riddles, effectively frustrating Blaine&#x27;s highly logical mind.
* In the &quot;Batman&quot; comic books, one of the hero&#x27;s best known enemies is The Riddler who is personally compelled to supply clues about his upcoming crimes to his enemies in the form of riddles and puzzles. Stereotypically, they are these kinds of simple children&#x27;s riddles, but modern treatments generally prefer to have the character use more sophisticated puzzles.

<text>Carlo Tresca (March 9, 1879 – January 11, 1943) was an Italian-American dissident, newspaper editor, orator, and labor organizer and activist who was a leader of the Industrial Workers of the World during the 1910s. He is remembered as a leading public opponent of fascism, Stalinism, and Mafia infiltration of the trade unions for the purposes of labor racketeering and corruption.

Born, raised, and educated in Italy, Tresca was editor of an Italian socialist newspaper and secretary of the Italian Federation of Railroad Workers before he emigrated to the United States in 1904. After a three-year spell as secretary of the Italian Socialist Federation of North America, he joined the Industrial Workers of the World in 1912, and was involved in strikes across the United States over the rest of the decade. He was jailed in 1925 after printing a paid advertisement for a birth control pamphlet in one of his newspapers.

During the 1930s, Tresca was a vocal critic of both Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist government in his native Italy, and of Joseph Stalin and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1937, he was a member of the Dewey Commission, which cleared Leon Trotsky of all charges made during the Moscow Trials. Tresca also used his newspapers to mount a public campaign criticising the Mafia. He was assassinated in New York in January 1943, allegedly by Carmine Galante.

==Personal life==
Carlo Tresca was born March 9, 1879, in Sulmona, Abruzzo, Italy, the son of a landowner. His formal education reached to secondary school. Tresca had no hope of attending university as his family&#x27;s finances were poor during the economic slump of the 1880s. He enrolled at a seminary instead but left soon afterward and emerged as an anticlerical and an atheist.

From 1898 to 1902, Tresca was secretary of the Italian Federation of Railroad Workers. He was also the editor of &quot;Il Germe,&quot; a socialist weekly based in Abruzzo. Seeking to avoid a jail term for his radical political activities, Tresca emigrated to the United States in 1904, settling in Philadelphia.

Tresca had a relationship with Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and Flynn&#x27;s sister, Bina, and was the father of Bina&#x27;s son Peter D. Martin. He also had a relationship with sculptor Minna Harkavy, whose bust of him was erected in his birth town of Sulmona.

==American years==
In America, Tresca was elected Secretary of the Italian Socialist Federation of North America in 1904. He remained in that position for the next three years. During this same interval, Tresca was also the editor of &quot;Il Proletario&quot; (The Proletarian), the official newspaper of the Italian Socialist Federation.

Tresca&#x27;s political views became increasingly radical and he soon came to identify himself as an anarchist. In 1907 Tresca resigned as editor of &quot;Il Proletario&quot; and began publishing his own newspaper, &quot;La Plebe&quot; (The Plebeian). He would later transfer &quot;La Plebe&quot; to Pittsburgh and, with it, revolutionary ideas to Italian miners and mill workers in Western Pennsylvania. In 1909, Tresca became editor of &quot;L&#x27;Avvenire,&quot; (The Future) remaining in that capacity until the coming of World War I, when the publication was suppressed under the Espionage Act.

Tresca joined the revolutionary syndicalist Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1912, when he was invited by the union to Lawrence, Massachusetts, to help mobilize the Italian workers during a campaign to free strike leaders Joseph Ettor and Arturo Giovannitti, jailed on false murder charges. After the victorious strike in Lawrence, Tresca was active in several strikes across the United States; the Little Falls, New York, textile workers&#x27; strike (1912), the New York City hotel workers&#x27; strike (1913), the Paterson silk strike (1913), and the Mesabi Range, Minnesota, miners&#x27; strike (1916). He was arrested several times and jailed for nine months awaiting trial for murder in conjunction with the Minnesota action, ultimately being released without going to trial.

In August 1920, Tresca became involved tangentially in the Irish War of Independence. As Sidney Czira, secretary of Cumann na mBan in New York, and sister of Grace Gifford, later recalled, &quot;Picketing of the British Embassy in Washington had been going on from 1916 onwards and I remember a very successful picketing that was undertaken as a protest in New York against the British arrest of Dr. Mannix in August 1920. This latter picketing was largely the work of an Italian called Carlo Tresca, a personal friend of the well-known Irish-American family of Flynn, who were great friends of James Connolly. Tresca had great influence among the sea-faring fraternity and suggested that we should call out the seamen from the British ships as a protest against the arrest of Dr. Mannix. This was done by pickets walking on the docks with placards, calling on the men to leave the ships. So far as I was concerned, this was rather an amusing incident, because I had a placard which read something like this, &quot;Hear the call of the blood and refuse to work on British ships&quot;. I realised that the call of the blood was addressed to Greeks, Italians, Lascars, etc., and when they saw a young woman with a placard they came up to enquire what the strike was about. My efforts to translate &quot;Hear the call of the blood&quot; into Italian were funny, but I found one word which they all seemed to know was &quot;tyranny - Irlanda&quot;, and smiling and nodding, they would all walk away. The picketing was extremely effective because when we were holding our meetings it was a thrilling sight when, from time to time, we would hear the march of feet and the crew of some ship would come marching into the room. We found out subsequently that Tresca, who had organised them, was generally supposed to be an anarchist! Of course, there were extremely severe penalties under American law for behaviour of this kind.&quot;

In August 1923, Tresca was arrested on charges of having printed an advertisement for a birth control pamphlet in his new publication, &quot;Il Martello&quot; (The Hammer). He was found guilty in an October 1923 trial and was sentenced to a year and a day in Atlanta Federal Penitentiary. This sentence was confirmed on November 10, 1924, and Tresca entered prison on January 5, 1925.

==Making enemies==
Tresca became a prominent figure among Italian-Americans for his opposition to fascism and was reported to Benito Mussolini as a leading enemy of the fascist movement. Tresca edited an anti-fascist newspaper named &quot;Il Martello&quot;, where he attacked the myths that undergirded Mussolini&#x27;s power. Tresca was monitored by the United States Department of Justice, who sought to deport him, and by Rome, where Mussolini feared that Italian-Americans would hurt his reputation with the United States and its banks. With pressure from the Italian ambassador to ban Tresca&#x27;s newspaper, the American government charged Tresca with publishing obscenities. Tresca was sentenced and subject to deportation, but public dissent led the United States President Calvin Coolidge to commute Tresca&#x27;s sentence. The fascists turned to violence, with a bombing assassination attempt in 1926, after which the antifascists fought back. Tresca contributed towards stopping Mussolini&#x27;s ideological spread among Italian-Americans, despite Tresca&#x27;s lack of reach into Italian-American media and business influence.

During the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti, Tresca organized publicity, fundraising, and the defense lawyer Fred Moore.

In the 1930s, Tresca became an outspoken opponent of Soviet communism and Stalinism, particularly after the Soviet Union had engineered the destruction of the anarchist movement in Catalonia and Aragon during the Spanish Revolution of 1936.

In 1937, Tresca was a member of the Dewey Commission, which cleared Leon Trotsky of all charges made during the Moscow Trials.

In early 1938, Tresca publicly accused the Soviets of kidnapping Juliet Stuart Poyntz to prevent her defection from the Communist Party USA underground apparatus. Tresca alleged that before she had disappeared, Poyntz had talked to him about &quot;exposing the communist movement&quot;.

==Assassination==
On January 11, 1943, in New York City, Tresca was leaving his parole officer&#x27;s offices when he dodged surveilling officers by jumping into a car that was waiting for him. Two hours later, Tresca was crossing Fifth Avenue at 15th Street on foot when a black Ford pulled up beside him. A short, squat gunman in a brown coat jumped out and shot Tresca in the back of the head with a handgun, killing him instantly. The black Ford was later found abandoned nearby with all four doors open. One theory at the time was that the suspected assassin was a member of the Mafia, acting on orders from Sicily, and other theories suggested that he was murdered by Italian fascists. Others have theorized that Tresca was eliminated by the NKVD as retribution for criticism of the Stalin regime of the Soviet Union.

Vito Genovese, the boss of the Genovese crime family, is said to have allegedly ordered the murder of Tresca, with the shooter allegedly being Carmine Galante of the Bonanno crime family. No one was ever charged in the Tresca murder.

A eulogy at his memorial service was delivered by Angelica Balabanoff, a socialist activist and former Bolshevik. According to Lewis Coser&#x27;s account of the funeral, &quot;I was sitting near a burly Irish policeman who clearly didn&#x27;t understand a word of Balabanoff&#x27;s fierce Italian oratory. But at her climax he burst into tears.&quot;

<doc id="268686" wikidata="Q833243" url="?curid=268686" title="Lesser scaup">
<text>The lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) is a small North American diving duck that migrates south as far as Central America in winter. It is colloquially known as the little bluebill or broadbill because of its distinctive blue bill. The origin of the name scaup may stem from the bird&#x27;s preference for feeding on scalp—the Scottish word for clams, oysters, and mussels; however, some credit it to the female&#x27;s discordant scaup call as the name&#x27;s source. It is apparently a very close relative of the Holarctic greater scaup or &quot;bluebill&quot; (&quot;A. marila&quot;), with which it forms a superspecies. The scientific name is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;aithuia&quot; an unidentified seabird mentioned by authors including Hesychius and Aristotle, and Latin, &quot;affinis&quot; &quot;related to&quot;, from its resemblance to the greater scaup.

==Description==
Adults are long, on average. The species can weigh ; males weigh on average and females weigh noticeably less, at on average. Wing lengths (not wingspans) are about in males and in females; the tarsus is about long, and the bill . The wingspan is .

The adult males (drakes) in definitive basic (breeding) plumage have a black, iridescent head and a small tuft at the hindcrown, a black breast, a whitish-grey back and wings with darker vermiculations and black outer and greyish-brown inner primary remiges. The underparts are white with some olive vermiculations on the flanks, and the rectrices and tail coverts are black. Adult females (hens) have a white band at the base of the bill, often a lighter ear region, and are otherwise dark brown all over, shading to white on the mid-belly. Drakes in eclipse plumage look similar, but with a very dark head and breast, little or no white on the head and usually some greyish vermiculations on the wings. Immature birds resemble the adult females, but are duller and have hardly any white at the bill base. Both sexes have white secondary remiges, a blue-grey bill with a smallblack &quot;nail&quot; at the tip and grey feet; the drakes have a bright yellow iris, while that of females is orange to yellow varying with age and that of immatures is brown. Downy hatchlings look much like those of related species, with dark brown upperparts and pale buff underparts, chin, supercilium and back spots.

These birds are not very vocal, at least compared to dabbling ducks. Hens give the namesake discordant &quot;scaup, scaup&quot; call; in courtship drakes produce weak whistles. Hens vocalize more often than those of the greater scaup—particularly during flight—but their call is weaker, a guttural &quot;brrtt, brrtt&quot;.

===Identification===
Lesser scaup are often hard to distinguish from the greater scaup when direct comparison is not possible, but in North America a large scaup flock will often have both species present. Females, juveniles and drakes in eclipse plumage are hard to identify; there is considerable overlap in length between the two species, but greater scaup are usually noticeably more bulky. Lesser scaup females and immatures tend to have less white around the bill, but this too varies considerably between individual birds. Lesser Scaup generally have a smaller and straighter bill, with a relatively narrow profile, while Greater Scaup have a wider, more spatulate profile toward the tip of the bill. The dark nail tip averages wider on Greater Scaup. In flight, the most tell-tale sign is the white secondary remiges, whereas in the greater scaup the white extends on the primary remiges also, i.e. far towards the wingtip. 

Lesser scaup drakes in nuptial plumage are often said to be recognizable by the purple instead of green sheen of the head and a darker back. But this is unreliable because it varies according to light conditions, and these birds are often too far away from the observer to make out any sheen at all. The shape of the head is a crucial difference, but only when birds are at rest and not actively diving. In the greater scaup drake, the forehead is usually quite massive (especially in North American and East Asian populations), whereas the nape presents a smooth shallow curve and may appear almost straightly sloping. The lesser scaup drake presents the opposite shape, with a less bulging forehead and a nape that looks strongly curved or even angular due to the small crest. When the birds raise their heads, these differences are most easy to spot, and after observing the two species in direct comparison it usually becomes easy to recognize. In fact, in basic plumage the lesser scaup drake may appear identical in shape and size to a drake of the ring-necked duck (&quot;A. collaris&quot;); the black back and wings of that species are hard to confuse with the light ones of the lesser scaup male though.

====Hybridization====
Particularly in the case of vagrant birds in Europe, the identification is complicated by similar-looking &quot;Aythya&quot; hybrids. Except for hybrids between the two scaup species, the most reliable mark is the black bill-tip of hybrids, whereas in the scaups only the very point (&quot;nail&quot;) of the bill is black. This is even recognizable at considerable range, as the scaups&#x27; bills appear uniformly grey from a distance, whereas those of hybrids look two-colored. European hybrids typically involve the tufted duck (&quot;A. fuligula&quot;), yielding offspring that have a small nape crest unlike any European &quot;Aythya&quot; species. Female and immature hybrids typically lack the white bill base, except in those between lesser scaup and ring-necked duck, where the white extends to the eye region. But especially with juveniles, the bi-colored bill of hybrids is most diagnostic.
Hybrid combinations that are known from the wild and resemble the lesser scaup are:
* The occurrence of hybridization between lesser and greater scaup in the wild is disputed. Such hybrids could only be identified with certainty by DNA sequence comparison however. But while they may exist unnoticed, they cannot be frequent, as the species are largely sympatric and closely related, yet remain distinct, with no signs of significant introgression.
* Hybrids between lesser scaup and ring-necked ducks are recognizable by very dark wings contrasting with a light grey underside more than in the lesser scaup but less than in the ring-necked duck.
* Hybrids between the lesser scaup and the redhead (&quot;A. americana&quot;) are recognizable by the lack of contrast between wings and belly and the dull brownish head.
* Hybrids between the tufted duck and the common pochard (&quot;A. ferina&quot;) are almost indistinguishable from lesser scaup, though neither parent species resembles &quot;A. affinis&quot;.
In theory, each and every &quot;Aythya&quot; species is able to produce potentially fertile hybrids with any other, though due to their different ranges and behavioral cues given during courtship most of these hybrids are only known from birds kept in captivity without conspecific mates.

Two syntype specimens of &quot;Fuligula affinis&quot; Eyton (Monogr. Anat., 1838, p.157.) are held in the vertebrate zoology collections of National Museums Liverpool at World Museum, with accession numbers NML-VZ D826c (female adult) and NML-VZ D826b (male adult). The specimens were collected in North America and came to the Liverpool national collection via Thomas Campbell Eyton’s collection and the 13th Earl of Derby’s collection which was bequeathed to the people of Liverpool in 1851.

== Distribution and migration ==
Their breeding habitat is inland lakes and marsh ponds in tundra from Alaska through western Canada to western Montana; few breed east of James Bay and the Great Lakes. Notable breeding concentrations, with more than half a million birds at the height of the season, can be found in Alaska, in the woodlands of the McKenzie River valley and on the Old Crow Flats. These birds migrate south (mostly via the Central and Mississippi Flyways) when the young are fledged and return early spring, usually arriving on the breeding ground in May. Lesser scaup typically travel in flocks of 25–50 birds and winter mainly on lakes, rivers and sheltered coastal lagoons and bays between the US–Canada border and northern Colombia, including Central America, the West Indies and Bermuda. 

Wintering lesser scaup are typically found in freshwater or slightly brackish habitat and unlike greater scaup rarely are seen offshore when unfrozen freshwater habitat is available. They may even spend the winter on lakes in parks, as long as they are not harassed, and will occur even on smallish Caribbean islands such as Grand Cayman. Thousands winter each year on the Topolobampo lagoons in Mexico, and even in the southernmost major wintering location—Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta in Colombia—hundreds of birds can be seen. In Central America, flocks are present from July on, but only really numerous after September. They move north again in April and May. In the extreme southeast and southwest of the breeding range—the Rocky Mountains region of the northwestern United States and the southern Great Lakes—lesser scaup are present all-year; it is not clear whether the breeding birds are replaced by migrants from the far north in winter, or whether the local populations do not migrate, or whether both local and migrant birds are found there in winter.

They are rarely—but apparently increasingly often—seen as vagrants in western Europe. The first documented British record was a first-winter male at Chasewater, Staffordshire in 1987 but by 2006, over 60 had been recorded, with an average of 2 per year. UK records are typically in the northern parts of the country. Vagrant lesser scaup have also been recorded on the Hawaiian Islands Japan, possibly China, and—for the first time on 18 January 2000—in the Marianas, as well as in Ecuador, Suriname, French Guiana, Trinidad and Venezuela (in winter), and Greenland (in summer).

==Ecology==
Lesser scaup forage mainly by sifting through the bottom mud, usually after diving and swimming underwater, occasionally by dabbling without diving. They mainly eat mollusks such as mussels and clams, as well as seeds and other parts of aquatic plants like sedges and bulrushes (Cyperaceae), &quot;pondweeds&quot;, widgeon-grass (&quot;Ruppia cirrhosa&quot;), wild celery (&quot;Vallisneria americana&quot;) or wild rice (&quot;Zizania&quot;). In winter, but less so in summer, other aquatic animals—crustacean, insect and their larvae and small fishes—form an important part of their diet. It has been reported that both the lesser and the greater scaup have shifted their traditional migration routes to take advantage of the presence of the zebra mussel (&quot;Dreissena polymorpha&quot;) in Lake Erie, which was accidentally introduced in the 1980s and has multiplied enormously. This may pose a risk to these birds because zebra mussels are efficient filter feeders and so accumulate environmental contaminants rapidly.

They nest in a sheltered location on the ground near water, usually among thick vegetation such as sedges and bulrushes, sometimes in small loose groups and not rarely next to colonies of gulls or terns; several females may deposit eggs in a single nest. The drakes court the hens in the winter quarters; pairs form shortly before and during the spring migration. When nesting starts, the males aggregate while they moult into eclipse plumage, leaving the task of incubation and raising the young to the females alone.

The nest is a shallow depression scraped in the ground and lined with plants and some down feathers. Breeding begins in May, but most birds nest only in June, later than usual for North American waterfowl. The clutch numbers about 9–11 eggs on average; up to 26 eggs have been found in a single nest, but such high numbers are from more than one female. Incubation is by the female only and lasts around 3 weeks. The young fledge some 45–50 days after hatching and soon thereafter the birds migrate to winter quarters already. Lesser scaup become sexually mature in their first or second summer. The oldest known individual reached an age of over 18 years.

Before the start of the population decline (see below), about 57% of the lesser scaup nests failed each breeding season because the female was killed or the eggs were eaten or destroyed. The average brood size of nests where eggs hatched successfully was 8.33 hatchlings.

==Conservation status==
Although the lesser scaup has the largest population of any species of diving duck in North America, their population has been steadily declining since the mid-1980s, and reached an all-time low in the early 21st century. During breeding bird surveys, lesser and greater scaup are counted together due to the impossibility of identifying the species unequivocally when large numbers of birds are involved. Lesser scaup are thought to comprise slightly less than nine-tenths of the scaup population of North America. In the 1970s, the lesser scaup population was estimated at 6.9 million birds on average; in the 1990s it had declined to about half that number, and by the late 2000s it is estimated at 3 million individuals or less. Due to the wide breeding range and the fact that the rate of decline, though remarkable, is still not threatening in respect to the enormous overall numbers, the lesser scaup is classified as a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN. An increase of the decline is liable to result in an uplisting to Near Threatened or even Vulnerable status.

The causes for this stark—though not threatening yet—decline remain unknown. There are indications that the breeding success is decreasing, but why this is so remains puzzling. On one hand, pollution and habitat destruction, especially in the wintering regions, has certainly increased since the early-mid 20th century. On the other hand, the narrow time frame in which lesser scaup breed and raise their young may be tied to some specific ecological conditions—such as abundance of key food, without the ducks being able to adapt. In this regard, it is alternatively or additionally possible that greater scaup, which may be increasing in numbers, is putting the lesser scaup under increasingly severe competition.

However, it seems that greater scaup eats larger food items on average, and the species are sympatric in part of their range and presumably have been for millennia without any problems due to competition. The experience of the past as well as the reproduction rate—even if this is declining—suggests that hunting has no major impact on lesser scaup populations at present either. Also, the breeding habitat is mainly in regions little-used by humans; habitat destruction on the breeding grounds is also not considered to be problematic.

<text>Wallace Fard Muhammad, also known as W. F. Muhammad, W. D. Fard, Wallace D. Fard, or Master Fard Muhammad, among other names (pronounced &quot;Far-odd&quot; ) (reportedly born February 26, – disappeared ) was the founder of the Nation of Islam. 

He arrived in Detroit in 1930 with an ambiguous background and several aliases and proselytized syncretic Islamic teachings to the city&#x27;s black population. His group taught followers to abandon their old &quot;slave names&quot; in favor of new names that were bestowed on new members. Fard&#x27;s movement similarly taught Black pride and Black exceptionalism, saying that the black man is the &quot;Original&quot; man, and teaching that the white race were devils created by eugenics. The group preached abstinence from drugs, alcohol, pork, and out-of-wedlock sex. 

After one of Fard&#x27;s followers performed a human sacrifice, Fard was briefly arrested. Fard was set free, but he was ordered by police to depart Detroit and not return. Instead he continued to return to the city, where he was spotted by police. In 1934, after repeated arrests and death threats, Fard left Detroit and ultimately disappeared.

Elijah Muhammad succeeded Fard as leader of the Nation of Islam. Fard&#x27;s teachings in turn influenced many, including Malcolm X, Clarence 13X, boxing legend Muhammad Ali, and indirectly, basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

==Fard before Detroit==

Fard&#x27;s origins are uncertain, as Fard variously identified as white, black, Spanish, Arab, Afghan, and on one occasion, Jewish. Scholar John Andrew Morrow describes Fard as a &quot;racial and ethnic chameleon&quot;, noting &quot;Farad lived in one of the most vicious, racist societies in the world: America. The conditions in which black people and indigenous people lived here were horrific. Segregation was severe. Bigotry abounded. White supremacy permeated everything. Lynchings were a daily occurrence; there were columns in the newspaper titled &#x27;Today&#x27;s Lynchings&#x27;... Fard witnessed unspeakable horrors committed by genuine devils... Why would Master Fard pass for white? Who wouldn&#x27;t?&quot;

Many scholars argue that Fard may have had been from the Indian subcontinent. On his World War I draft card, Fard identified as a citizen of Afghanistan, born in Shinkay. Fard reportedly spent time at the Ahmadiyya Mosque (a movement prominent in Pakistan), used translations of the Quran from Pakistanis, and bestowed Pakistani names on followers. Fard&#x27;s teaching of the Tribe of Shabazz may have been tied to Pakistan&#x27;s Shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar. 

Some speculate Fard was a Turk or a Greek -- he had been known as &quot;Fred the Greek&quot; and &quot;Fred the Turk&quot; in 1908. Some claim Fard was a white man, perhaps from New Zealand -- Fard indicated that background in records from 1920. In 1924, when he married a woman of Spanish ancestry, Fard claimed he had been born in Madrid, Spain. Less popular theories of origin suggest he may have been Syrian, Moroccan, Bosnian, Albanian, African-American, or Jewish. Fard was traditionally held by the Nation of Islam to be an Arab from Mecca.
===Oregon===
Prior to his time in Detroit, Fard operated a food cart and later restaurant in Oregon and California. In 1908, papers in Eugene, Oregon announced that Turkish tamale vendor Fred Walldad had acquired a small house on wheels to use as a food cart. That Halloween, papers reported on a &quot;Halloween prank&quot; in which local boys took the wheels off Fred the Turk&#x27;s tamale wagon and dropped it, breaking Fred&#x27;s dishes and eggs, as well as injuring Fred himself; the wheel was stolen. By the following February, he had sold his lunchwagon and moved to Cottage Grove, where he had leased a restaurant and lodging house. 

By 1912, Fard was again selling tamales, this time in Salem, Oregon; newspapers reported on vendor Fred Dadd, a naturalized American originally from New Zealand, attending his first baseball game. In 1913, Fard penned an announcement in the newspaper complaining about police harassment. His complaint of police harassment would be investigated by the police committee. After the committee reported and the report was adopted, the mayor instructed the chief of police to allow Dodd to sell his wares.

In 1914, Fard was arrested for allegedly inducing Laura E. Swanson to leave her spouse for him; he was released on $1,000 bond. A March 23 report cited Dodd&#x27;s charge as &quot;assaulting a married woman&quot;. On April 20, 1914, Dodd married Pearl Allen, a white-passing member of the Klamath people, in Multnomah County, Oregon. The following day, April 21, a jury acquitted Dodd. &quot;The Capital Journal&quot; explained the verdict by saying &quot;It was brought out in the cross examination of the complaining witness that there was another person in the house at the time of the alleged assault and that she did not cry for help as a person in her circumstances would be aroused.&quot;

The marriage to Pearl was short-lived; Divorce proceedings began by August 30. On November 14, he was arrested for larceny after allegedly stealing from Pearl. Pearl gave birth to a son the following year, though a 2024 DNA test may suggest that this son was not biologically descended from Dodd.

===Los Angeles and San Quentin===
Fard moved to Los Angeles, using the name Wallie Dodd Ford, where he owned a restaurant. The Nation of Islam contests the claim that Wallace Fard Muhammad and Wallie Dodd Ford were the same person.

Ford was arrested by Los Angeles police on November 17, 1918, on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon. As of 1920, Ford was still living in Los Angeles as 26-year-old Wallie D. Ford, with his 25-year-old common law wife, Hazel E. Ford. The pair had a son, Wallie Dodd Ford Jr.

A marriage certificate, dated June 5, 1924, was issued to Wallie Dodd Ford and Carmen Treviño, a Mexican-born woman of Spanish ancestry, in Santa Ana, California. 

Ford was arrested again on January 20, 1926, for violation of the California Woolwine Possession Act, and on February 15, 1926, for violation of the State Poison Act. After this second arrest, a Spanish-language paper in Los Angeles described him as a &quot;street politician&quot;. Ford was sentenced to six months to six years at San Quentin State Prison on June 12, 1926. Ford was paroled from San Quentin on May 27, 1929.

===In Chicago===
In the 1930 census, Fard was listed as a resident of Chicago, with stated occupation of clothing salesman. Scholars speculate that Fard&#x27;s Nation of Islam might have been influenced by the Moorish Science Temple in Chicago: Both groups saw &quot;Negroes&quot; as Afro-Asiastic, bestowed new names to replace slave names, and promoted wearing of the fez.

==Fard in Detroit (1930–34)==

Fard first appeared in Detroit in 1930; his followers cite July 4, 1930, as the date of his arrival. A door-to-door salesman, Fard spread his religious teachings throughout Detroit, and within three years grew the movement to a reported 25,000 members in Detroit, Chicago, and other cities.

===Clothing peddler===
Fard began by selling Oriental silks door-to-door in Detroit&#x27;s black section. Fard visited the homes of black families who had recently migrated to Detroit from the rural South. Fard told black residents that his silks were the same kind that their ancestors in Mecca used and claimed to be a traveler from that land. When offered food, Fard reportedly ate what was provided but would advise residents to avoid certain foods, promising health benefits would follow. At his suggestion, he came back to teach the residents, along with guests.

===Bible study leader at house churches===
In the early stage of his ministry, Fard used the Bible as his textbook, since it was the only religious book with which the majority of his audience were familiar. Patrick D. Bowen writes that in the early Nation of Islam, &quot;ministers regularly referenced passages from the Bible to prove their claims&quot;. Fard&#x27;s successor Elijah Muhammad would later claim Fard &quot;knew the Bible better than any of the Christian-bred Negroes&quot;. Lomax wrote that Fard was &quot;well-versed&quot; in the Bible, used it as a textbook and taught in the style of a Southern Baptist preacher.

Beynon writes that &quot;With growing prestige over a constantly increasing group, [Fard] became bolder in his denunciation of white people and began to attack the teachings of the Bible in such a way as to shock his audience and bring them to an emotional crisis.&quot;

Fard taught a form of black exceptionalism and self-pride to poor Southern blacks during the Great Northward Migration at a time when old ideas of scientific racism were prevalent. He advocated that community members establish and own their own businesses, eat healthy, raise families, and refrain from drugs and alcohol. In 1938, sociologist Erdmann Doane Beynon published in the &quot;American Journal of Sociology&quot; a firsthand account of several interviews he conducted with followers of Fard in Michigan. From those interviews, Beynon wrote that Fard lived and taught in Detroit from 1930 to 1934.

===Giver of new names===
Fard taught his followers to reject surnames inherited from white slaveowners. As part of their initiation into the group, Fard bestowed new Muslim names upon his converts. He taught that this practice restored their original and true identities, while also revealing the lies that cloaked the origins of the so-called Asiatic Blackman. Such names included Muhammad, Ali, Karriem, and Fardan. Scholars note that new names had previously been given by Noble Drew Ali of the Moorish Science Temple of America, who assigned surnames El and Bey; the term &quot;slave name&quot; was used by the MSTA.

After Fard&#x27;s disappearance, Elijah Muhammad continued the practice of giving new Muslim names to converts to the Nation of Islam and added the letter X, symbolizing the unknown, instead of a name.

===Leader of the Allah Temple of Islam===
Beynon&#x27;s interviewees told him that reports of Fard&#x27;s message spread throughout the black community. Attendance at the house meetings grew until the listeners were divided into groups and taught in shifts. Finally, the community contributed money and rented a hall to serve as a temple where meetings were conducted. The Quran was soon introduced as the most authoritative of all texts for the study of the faith. Fard prepared texts that served as authoritative manuals of the faith and were memorized verbatim by his followers.

According to Beynon, Fard&#x27;s followers grew to approximately eight thousand, and &quot;[w]ithin three years the prophet not only began the movement but organized it so well that he himself was able to recede into the background, appearing almost never to his followers during the final months of his residence in Detroit.&quot;

During this time, Clara Poole, later renamed Clara Muhammad, was introduced to W.D. Fard and his teachings through her in-laws. His teachings gave Poole hope and presented her life with new possibilities and new memories. After one of Fard&#x27;s services, during which he asked if someone knew Elijah Poole, Clara, introduced him and his teachings to her husband, Elijah Poole, who later became Elijah Muhammad. His guidance and teachings eventually changed and reformed Elijah Poole into a responsible and ideal husband, who would later become the face and leader of the Nation Of Islam. 

From interviews with approximately two hundred families who followed Fard, Beynon concluded:Although the prophet lived in Detroit from July 4, 1930 until June 30, 1934, virtually nothing is known about him, save that he &#x27;came from the East&#x27; and that he &#x27;called&#x27; the Negroes of North America to enter the Nation of Islam. His very name is uncertain. He was known usually as Mr. Wali Farrad or Mr. W. D. Fard, though he used also the following names: Professor Ford, Mr. Farrad Mohammed, Mr. F. Mohammed Ali. One of the few survivors who heard his first addresses states that he himself said: &#x27;My name is W. D. Fard and I came from the Holy City of Mecca. More about myself I will not tell you yet, for the time has not yet come. I am your brother. You have not yet seen me in my royal robes.&#x27; Legends soon sprang up about this mysterious personality.

In 1933, he began signing his name &quot;W. F. Muhammad&quot;, which stood for Wallace Fard Muhammad, and used it on several lessons written in 1933 and 1934.

=== &quot;Voodoo Murder&quot; drives Fard from Detroit (1932) ===
On November 20, 1932, Robert Harris (who had received the name Robert Karriem from Fard) escorted James J. Smith into a room with a makeshift altar. In the audience were twelve adult witnesses and Harris&#x27;s wife and children. Smith, who believed he was being inducted into the Allah Temple of Islam, was asked if he would sacrifice his life for Islam, and Smith nodded his assent. Harris then stabbed Smith in the chest, and proceeded to bludgeon him to death with an axle rod.

After neighbors called the police, Harris was arrested. Under questioning, he confessed to the murder: &quot;I had to kill somebody, I could not forsake my gods&quot;. Police initiated a manhunt for Fard and another leader, Ugan Ali, who were arrested and questioned. Harris was deemed insane and committed to a mental hospital. &quot;The society cannot be blamed for anything he did,&quot; Ali was quoted as saying in the &quot;Detroit News&quot;. Fard and Ugan Ali, who acknowledged leadership of the Allah Temple of Islam but vehemently denied any teaching of human sacrifice, were examined by psychiatrist David Clark, who recommended they be committed for further observation. A judge agreed, and both Fard and Ugan Ali were placed in straitjackets and confined in padded cells.

With Fard and Ugan Ali still in custody five days after the murder, Elijah Muhammad, at the time known as Elijah Karriem, led over two hundred members into the court building and staged a protest on the main floor. The police spent a full day expelling the protesters. 
On November 25, Harris was arraigned on charges of first-degree murder; he pleaded guilty, but his bizarre courtroom behavior convinced witnesses of his insanity. On December 6, three psychiatrists testified that Harris was legally insane, and he was committed to the Ionia State Hospital for the Criminal Insane; he died there on June 19, 1935. Faced with criminal charges, Ugan Ali was released after promising to help disband the Allah Temple of Islam, while Fard agreed to forever leave Detroit as a condition of release.

On December 7, 1932, police put Fard on a train bound for Chicago. The Allah Temple of Islam was officially disbanded, though soon replaced by a new organization called the Nation of Islam. Former leader Ugan Ali was replaced by Elijah Muhammad.

===Fard in exile and the Nation of Islam (1932–34)===
In January 1933, Fard snuck back into Detroit and held secret meetings with followers. Fard left Detroit for a few weeks but returned to Detroit and resumed preaching on street corners. Recognized by police, he was arrested on May 25, booked, and photographed. He was again released and ordered to depart the city.

Fard renamed his community the &quot;Nation of Islam&quot;. Following the rapid increase in membership, he instituted a formal organizational structure. He established the Muslim Girls&#x27; Training and General Civilization Class, where women were taught how to keep their houses, clean, and cook. The men of the organization were drilled by captains and referred to as the Fruit of Islam. The entire movement was placed under a Minister of Islam.

On September 26, Fard was arrested in Chicago by local police while addressing an audience in a rented hall. The following morning, the Chicago judge Dunn dismissed charges of disturbing the peace and released Fard. Fard made a third surreptitious visit to Detroit, this time preaching that the white man would soon be destroyed by poison bombs.

Fard established the University of Islam, where school-aged children were taught, as an alternative to Detroit public schools. By January 1934, local truant officers had noticed the pattern of dropouts and alerted authorities. On March 27, the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; proclaimed that the &quot;voodoo cult&quot; had been revived, and the city initiated legal action against the school. The school was raided by police, and Elijah Muhammad was arrested.

Press reported that at trial, fifteen-year-old Sally Ali, who had attended the University of Islam, testified that she had been taught &quot;in the Islamic New Deal that if she cut off the heads of four devils—devils being unrighteous people—she would win a free trip to Mecca and a button of some sort.&quot; She further testified that she had been taught that Caucasians would be destroyed in the year 1934 by poison gas and fighting. Elijah Muhammad was found guilty for his role in establishing an unlicensed school, but he was released on probation. Amid rumors that police wanted both Fard and his chief aide dead, Elijah Muhammad fled for Chicago, and Fard was never again seen by most residents of Detroit.

==Fard&#x27;s fate and death==
It is not known what became of Fard or the circumstances of his death. Though he was a naturalized citizen, he may have been forced to accept voluntary deportment; In 1932, the &quot;Escanaba Daily Press&quot; reported that he had been awaiting an immigration hearing. 

After he had departed Detroit, Fard visited Hazel Barton, the mother of his child, in Los Angeles; she recalled him only eating one meal per day as part of his new lifestyle. Hazel recalled he was driving a new car with California plates, with white sheets covering the seats. He left the sheets with her, saying he was going &quot;back to New Zealand&quot;. 

Fard&#x27;s last known contact with the Nation of Islam was a letter sent from Mexico which was received in March 1934. Morrow speculates that Fard might have tried to return to the US under another name.

For decades after Fard&#x27;s disappearance, Elijah Muhammad maintained that Fard was alive and well. Fard suffered from diabetes and had to carry sugar packets; Morrow notes the possibility that Fard might have died not long after his disappearance.

==Ideology==
Beynon described the substance of Fard&#x27;s teaching as follows:The black men in North America are not Negroes, but members of the lost tribe of Shabazz, stolen by traders from the Holy City of Mecca 379 years ago. The prophet came to America to find and to bring back to life his long lost brethren, from whom the Caucasians had taken away their language, their nation and their religion. Here in America they were living other than themselves. They must learn that they are the original people, noblest of the nations of the earth. The Caucasians are the colored people, since they have lost their original color. The original people must regain their religion, which is Islam, their language, which is Arabic, and their culture, which is astronomy and higher mathematics, especially calculus. They must live according to the law of Allah, avoiding all meat of &#x27;poison animals&#x27;, hogs, ducks, geese, possums and catfish. They must give up completely the use of stimulants, especially liquor. They must clean themselves up – both their bodies and their houses. If in this way they obeyed Allah, he would take them back to the Paradise from which they had been stolen – the Holy City of Mecca.

Fard&#x27;s lessons themselves state that the &quot;traders&quot; referenced by Beynon came to Africa, not Mecca.

Modern Nation of Islam theology is based upon the belief that Fard&#x27;s teaching of Elijah Muhammad was fulfillment of scripture regarding God&#x27;s teaching of an Apostle, where Fard is described as &quot;God in Person&quot;, the &quot;Messiah&quot;, and the &quot;Mahdi&quot;. Fard wrote the following for his followers:[T]he LESSONS that OUR SAVIOUR (ALLAH) gave us to Study and Learn is the Fulfillment of the Prophecies of All the Former Prophets concerning the Beginning of the Devils, and the Ending of the Civilization, and of our Enslavement by the Devils, and Present Time of our Delivery from the Devils by OUR SAVIOUR (ALLAH). PRAISE HIS HOLY NAME! There is No God but ALLAH. How that ALLAH would separate us from the Devils and, then destroy them; and Change us into a New and Perfect People; and Fill the Earth with FREEDOM, JUSTICE and EQUALITY as it was filled with wickedness; and Making we, the Poor Lost-Founds, the Perfect RULERS.

In Elijah Muhammad&#x27;s 1965 book &quot;Message to the Blackman in America&quot;, which is a compilation of articles written for newspapers throughout the early part of his ministry, Muhammad summarized what Fard taught him as follows:He began teaching us the knowledge of ourselves, of God and the devil, of the measurement of the earth, of other planets, and of the civilization of some of the planets other than earth. ... He measured and weighed the earth and its water; the history of the moon; the history of the two nations, black and white, that dominate the earth. He gave the exact birth of the white race; the name of their God who made them and how; and the end of their time, the judgment, how it will begin and end. ... He taught us the truth of how we were made &#x27;slaves&#x27; and how we are kept in slavery by the &#x27;slave-masters&#x27; children. He declared the doom of America, for her evils to us was past due. And that she is number one to be destroyed. Her judgment could not take place until we hear the truth. ... He declared that we were without the knowledge of self or anyone else. How we had been made blind, deaf and dumb by this white race of people and how we must return to our people, our God and His religion of peace (Islam), the religion of the prophets. We must give up the slave names of our slave-masters and accept the name of Allah (God) or one of His divine attributes. He also taught us to give up all evil doings and practices and do righteousness or be destroyed from the face of the earth. He taught us that the slave-masters had taught us to eat the wrong food and that this is the cause of our sickness and short span of life. He declared that he would heal us and set us in heaven at once, if we would submit to Him. Otherwise he would chastise us with a severe chastisement until we did submit. And that He was able to force the whole world into submission to his will. He said that he loved us (the so-called Negroes), his lost and found, so well that he would eat rattlesnakes to free us if necessary, for he has power over all things. 

Part of Fard&#x27;s teaching also involved admiration for Japan. 

Both during and after his life, some charged that Fard was a conman who used mystery and charisma to swindle poor blacks, selling them new Muslim names and stirring up racial animosity by copying selected elements of other Muslim religious sects and ideologies that fit his racial supremacist narrative.
===Influences===

Fard was influenced by the Jehovah&#x27;s Witness movement, Freemansonry (especially the Shriners), Marcus Garvey, Moorish Science, and of course Islam. 

The teaching of the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses has been called &quot;the most obvious non-Islamic source for [Fard&#x27;s] teachings&quot;. Fard was known to teach from what a Detroit newspaper described as &quot;The Bible of Islam&quot;; in 2023, the book was identified as &quot;Deliverance!&quot; by Joseph Franklin Rutherford, of the Watch Tower Society or Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. Fard recommended radio broadcasts by Rutherford, Frank Norris, and other millennial preachers. Jehovah&#x27;s Witness founder Charles Taze Russell, like Fard, interpreted the year 1914 as the beginning of an apocalypse. Both groups instructed members to refuse compulsory military service. Both groups taught that souls were not immortal, that there was no afterlife, and that heaven and hell were states of life on Earth rather than allegories. 

Fard encouraged students to read James Henry Breasted’s &quot;Conquest of Civilization&quot;, Hendrick van Loon’s &quot;The Story of Mankind&quot; and books on Freemansonry. Fard recommended the writings of Henry Ford, including &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, an anti-Jewish forgery promoted by Henry Ford. Police found literature by anti-Jewish preacher Gerald Burton Winrod.

Fard is believed to have been influenced by the Moorish Science Temple of America, which also assigned new names to members to replace their &quot;slave name&quot;. Both groups taught African-Americans to identify as &#x27;Asiatics&#x27;, both groups wore the fez. Both groups met at &quot;temples&quot;, not mosques. Freemasonry has similarly been thought to be a souce of inspiration; Elijah Pool (later Elijah Muhammad) had been a Freemason before meeting Fard. Garveyism has similarly be cited an inspiration, with modern scholars noting Garvey&#x27;s teachings were popular in San Quentin.

The Islamic scholar John Andrew Morrow summarizes Fard&#x27;s teachings as rooted in &quot;a wide variety of ideas from both East and West&quot; including &quot;Twelver Shi&#x27;ism, Sevener Shi&#x27;ism, Druzism, and Shi&#x27;ite Extremism, as well as Babism, Baha&#x27;ism, Yezidism, Ahmadism, and Sufism.&quot; Like Islam, Fard&#x27;s teaching forbade drugs, alcohol, and pork; Fard also preached against &#x27;slave foods&#x27; like ducks, geese, possums and catfish.

==Legacy==
Fard influenced his successor Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm X, and many other Black nationalist thinkers. The annual Saviours&#x27; Day event is held in honor of Fard&#x27;s birth. In 2020, it attracted an estimated 14,000 participants.

===Continued deification under Elijah Muhammad===

With regard to Elijah Muhammad, Beynon&#x27;s article stated: &quot;From among the larger group of Muslims there has sprung recently an even more militant branch than the Nation of Islam itself. This new movement, known as the Temple People. To Mr. Fard alone do they offer prayer and sacrifice. Since Mr. Fard has been deified, the Temple People raise the former Minister of Islam, now a resident of Chicago.&quot; This reference is in conflict with the first hand accounts of Malcolm X, such as his appearance in 1963 on the news program City Desk. Malcolm X states that Elijah Mohammed was neither Allah nor a Prophet, but rather that he was a Messenger. Elijah Muhammad, who led the Nation of Islam from 1934 to 1975, heard Fard teach for the first time in 1931. Elijah Muhammad stated that he and Fard became inseparable between 1931 and 1934, where he felt &quot;jailed almost&quot; due to the amount of time that they spent together with Fard teaching him day and night.

A handwritten lesson written by Fard states:Twelve Leaders of Islam from all over the Planet have conferred in the Root of Civilization concerning the Lost-Found Nation of Islam – must return to their original Land. One of the Conference Members by the name of Mr. Osman Sharrieff said to the Eleven Members of the Conference: &#x27;The Lost-Found Nation of Islam will not return to their original Land unless they, first, have a thorough Knowledge of their own.&#x27; So they sent a Messenger to them of their own. Now, the Messenger and his Laborers worked day and night for the last three and one-half years, and their accomplishments are approximately twenty-five thousand...

In this lesson, Fard places the number of converts obtained in Detroit at 25,000, and he describes a &quot;Messenger&quot; sent to the &quot;Lost-Found Nation of Islam&quot; who is &quot;of their own&quot;. Nation of Islam theology states that this &quot;Messenger&quot; is Elijah Muhammad. Fard wrote, in his instructions to the leaders of his community, that they should &quot;copy the Answers of Lesson of Minister Elijah Muhammad.&quot; He went on to state: &quot;Why is Stress made to the Muslims to Copy, the Minister, Elijah Muhammad&#x27;s Answers? The past History shows that the ALMIGHTY ALLAH sends Prophets and Apostles for the people&#x27;s Guide and Example, and through them HIS Mystery was Revealed. And those who follow the Apostle would see the Light.&quot;

Fard wrote several lessons which are read and committed to memory by members of the Nation of Islam. Some of the lessons are in the form of questions asked by Fard to Elijah Muhammad. One such lesson concludes with the text: &quot;This Lesson No. 2 was given by our Prophet, W.D. Fard, which contains 40 questions answered by Elijah Muhammad, one of the lost found in the wilderness of North America February 20th, 1934.&quot;

While some scholars argue that Fard&#x27;s divinity was a creation of Elijah Muhammad, Morrow points out that Fard did identify himself as God to Detroit police and that the psychiatrists who examined Fard after his arrest reported that Fard had delusions of Godhood. Morrow argues that under Elijah Muhammad, the doctrine of whites as devils was emphasized, while Fard had taught that &quot;devils&quot; were unbelievers of all races.

===FBI&#x27;s public claims about Fard===
A declassified Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) memorandum dated May 16, 1957, states: &quot;From a review of instant file it does not appear that there has been a concerted effort to locate and fully identify W. D. Fard. In as much as Elijah Muhammad recognizes W.D. Fard as being Allah (God) and claims that Fard is the source of all of his teachings, it is suggested that an exhaustive effort be made to fully identify and locate W. D. Fard and/or members of his family.&quot; The FBI took note of the article written by Erdmann Doane Beynon, and it conducted a search for Fard using various aliases including the name &quot;Ford&quot;. On October 17, 1957, the FBI located and interviewed Hazel Barton-Ford, Wallie Ford&#x27;s common-law wife, with whom he had a son named Wallace Dodd Ford, born on September 1, 1920. This son, later also known as Wallace Max Ford, died in 1942. He was serving for the United States Coast Guard, during World War II, at the time of his death. Barton-Ford gave a description of Wallie Ford, and described him as a Caucasian New Zealander. The FBI&#x27;s search for Fard was officially closed the following year on April 15, 1958. Immigration records did not match any of his aliases. His true identity remains unknown, but there is strong evidence that the Nation of Islam founder Wallace D. Fard was the same man as Wallace Dodd Ford, an inmate in San Quentin Prison. According to Patrick D. Bowen, a PhD candidate at the University of Denver&#x27;s Iliff School of Theology, fingerprints and photographs taken from San Quentin Prison matched those of Fard taken during the 1930s in Detroit; furthermore, in San Quentin he almost certainly came in contact with African American Muslim preachers and converts also incarcerated there.

On August 15, 1959, the FBI sent a story to the Chicago &quot;New Crusader&quot; newspaper, stating that Fard was a &quot;Turkish-born Nazi agent who worked for Hitler in World War II&quot;. According to the FBI story, Fard was a &quot;Muslim from Turkey who had come to the United States in the early 1900s. He had met Muhammad in prison … where the two men plotted a confidence game in which followers were charged a fee to become Muslims.&quot; 

After the story was published, Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X subsequently charged black media outlets, which reprinted the accusation in large numbers, with running the story without requesting a response from the Nation of Islam.

According to the FBI, Fard was linked to the Pacific Movement of the Eastern World, a pro-Japanese movement of African Americans which promoted the idea that the Empire of Japan was the champion of all non-white peoples, and to senior members of the Black Dragon Society, such as Satokata Takahashi and Ashima Takis. The FBI charged that Takahashi had been an influential presence in the Nation of Islam. He spoke as a guest at the NOI temples in Detroit and Chicago. A February 19, 1963, FBI memorandum states: &quot;In connection with efforts to disrupt and curb growth of the NOI, extensive research has been conducted into various files maintained by this office. Among the files reviewed was that of Wallace Dodd Ford.&quot; Five months later, in July 1963, the FBI told the &quot;Los Angeles Evening Herald-Examiner&quot; that Fard was actually Wallace Dodd Ford. The paper published the story in an article titled &quot;Black Muslim Founder Exposed As White.&quot; An FBI memorandum dated August 1963 states that the FBI had not been able to verify his birthdate or birthplace, and &quot;he was last heard from in 1934.&quot;

===Demotion by Warith Deen Mohammed===
Upon Elijah Muhammad&#x27;s death in February 1975, his son Wallace (later Warith) was named successor and instituted sweeping reforms. Where his father has regarded Fard as a physical manifestation of Allah, Wallace denounced Fard as a human who &quot;had his own designs on the black community&quot;. The group discontinued the annual Savior&#x27;s Day celebration in honor of Fard.

Wallace brought the group closer to mainstream Sunni Islam, restyling their &#x27;temples&#x27; as mosques while &#x27;ministers&#x27; became known as imams. Wallace rejected black nationalism in favor of Islamic anti-racism and disbanded the militaristic &quot;Fruit of Islam&quot; group.

In a 2000s interview alongside Louis Farrakhan, Warith Deen Muhammad described breaking with his father Elijah Muhammad over the issue of Fard&#x27;s divinity:

I differed with my father, and I didn&#x27;t want to differ with him. In fact I never differed with him directly, he was told that someone heard me saying something different. So he called me to question me about it.

And I told him that I could more readily believe &quot;he&quot; was God, than I could believe that his teacher was God. Because his teacher was a white man and he said white people were devils.

My mother, when I was leaving the home one day, after my father had insisted that I accept God the way he presented God, or I was gonna be cut off from all communication, he told me he knew it would hurt me to know that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to see my mother. He said - &quot;you won&#x27;t be able to talk to your mother or see her&quot;. So... I didn&#x27;t change, and as I was leaving my mother was hurt, and it hurt me to see her hurting like that.

She said, she walked me to the door, which she didn&#x27;t do, that wasn&#x27;t normal for her. And she stood on the porch at the door and she said - &#x27;Wallace, why don&#x27;t you go back there and accept it? Just say you believe.&#x27;

I said - &#x27;Mama, tell me what Mr. Fard told you all. Did he tell you he was God?&#x27;

And she looked like her face went blank, and looked like she didn&#x27;t know what to say, and in a few seconds she said - &#x27;No, he did not. In fact he told us to not even call him Prophet, said that was too big a title for him.&#x27;

Then I said to my mother - &#x27;How can you ask your son now, to accept a man as God, who said Prophet was too big a title for him?&#x27;.
===False claim that Muhammad Abdullah was Fard===
After the death of Elijah Muhammad in 1975, his son and new Nation of Islam leader Wallace D. Muhammad suggested that his newly appointed Oakland California Imam Muhammad Abdullah was Fard, though Abdullah himself later retracted this claim. Scholar Fatimah Fanusie has argued that Abdullah was, in fact, Fard. Abdullah was reportedly introduced as Fard to boxing legend Muhammad Ali.

===Restoration under Louis Farrakhan===
In 1978, Farrakhan and a small number of supporters decided to rebuild what they considered the original Nation of Islam upon the foundations established by Wallace Fard Muhammad and Elijah Muhammad.

In 1979, Farrakhan&#x27;s group founded a weekly newspaper entitled &quot;The Final Call&quot;, which was intended to be similar to the original &quot;Muhammad Speaks&quot; newspaper that Malcolm X claimed to have started, Farrakhan had a weekly column in &quot;The Final Call&quot;. In 1981, Farrakhan and his supporters held their first Saviours&#x27; Day convention in Chicago, Illinois, and took back the name of the Nation of Islam. The event was similar to the earlier Nation&#x27;s celebrations, last held in Chicago on February 26, 1975. At the convention&#x27;s keynote address, Farrakhan announced his attempt to restore the Nation of Islam under Elijah Muhammad&#x27;s teachings.

In a 2000s interview featuring both Louis Farrakhan and Warith Deen Muhammad, Farrakhan argued that &quot;Master Fard Muhammad taught us to accept our own and to be ourselves. We know that he, a man born February 26, 1877, is not the originator of the Heavens and Earth... Fard Muhammad developed a methodology, strange as it seems, unorthodox as it seems, even poisonous as it may seem, yet it was a prescription that started bringing balance to the system, and that we would evolve from a Nationalist Black-thinking people into the universal message of Islam.&quot;

In 2007, the Nation of Islam had an estimated membership of 20,000–50,000.

===In popular culture===
Fard appears in the novel &quot;Middlesex&quot;, by Jeffrey Eugenides, in which Fard&#x27;s Detroit Temple No. 1 is the setting for several scenes.

Fard and his teachings are also referenced in many hip-hop songs. Artists who have made references within their music include Jay-Z and Jay Electronica in the song &quot;We Made It&quot;, Brand Nubian in the song &quot;Wake Up&quot;, and Ras Kass in the song &quot;Riiiot!&quot;

<doc id="268717" wikidata="Q223266" url="?curid=268717" title="Vassal">
<text>A vassal or liege subject is a person regarded as having a mutual obligation to a lord or monarch, in the context of the feudal system in medieval Europe. While the subordinate party is called a vassal, the dominant party is called a suzerain. The rights and obligations of a vassal are called vassalage, while the rights and obligations of a suzerain are called suzerainty.
The obligations of a vassal often included military support by knights in exchange for certain privileges, usually including land held as a tenant or fief. The term is also applied to similar arrangements in other feudal societies.

In contrast, fealty (&quot;fidelitas&quot;) was sworn, unconditional loyalty to a monarch.

== European vassalage ==
In fully developed vassalage, the lord and the vassal would take part in a commendation ceremony composed of two parts, the homage and the fealty, including the use of Christian sacraments to show its sacred importance. According to Eginhard&#x27;s brief description, the &quot;commendatio&quot; made to Pippin the Younger in 757 by Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria, involved the relics of Saints Denis, Rusticus, Éleuthère, Martin, and Germain – apparently assembled at Compiegne for the event. Such refinements were not included from the outset when it was time of crisis, war, hunger, etc. Under feudalism, those who were weakest needed the protection of the knights who owned the weapons and knew how to fight.

Feudal society was increasingly based on the concept of &quot;lordship&quot; (French &quot;seigneur&quot;), which was one of the distinguishing features of the Early Middle Ages and had evolved from times of Late Antiquity.

In the time of Charlemagne (ruled 768–814), the connection slowly developed between vassalage and the grant of land, the main form of wealth at that time. Contemporaneous social developments included agricultural &quot;manorialism&quot; and the social and legal structures labelled — but only since the 18th century — &quot;feudalism&quot;. These developments proceeded at different rates in various regions. In Merovingian times (5th century to 752), monarchs would reward only the greatest and most trusted vassals with lands. Even at the most extreme devolution of any remnants of central power, in 10th-century France, the majority of vassals still had no fixed estates.

The stratification of a fighting band of vassals into distinct groups might roughly correlate with the new term &quot;fief&quot; that had started to supersede &quot;benefice&quot; in the 9th century. An &quot;upper&quot; group comprised great territorial magnates, who were strong enough to ensure the inheritance of their benefice to the heirs of their family. A &quot;lower&quot; group consisted of landless knights attached to a count or duke. This social settling process also received impetus in fundamental changes in the conduct of warfare. As co-ordinated cavalry superseded disorganized infantry, armies became more expensive to maintain. A vassal needed economic resources to equip the cavalry he was bound to contribute to his lord to fight his frequent wars. Such resources, in the absence of a money economy, came only from land and its associated assets, which included peasants as well as wood and water.

==Difference between &quot;vassal&quot; and &quot;vassal state&quot;==
Many empires have set up vassal states, based on tribes, kingdoms, or city-states, the subjects of which they wish to control without having to conquer or directly govern them. In these cases a subordinate state (such as a dependency, residency, client state or protectorate) has retained internal autonomy, but has lost independence in foreign policy, while also, in many instances, paying formal tribute, or providing troops when requested.
This is a similar relationship to vassals, but vassals hold fiefdoms which are present in the actual territory of the monarch.

In this framework, a &quot;formal colony&quot; or &quot;junior ally&quot; might also be regarded as a vassal state in terms of international relations, analogous to a domestic &quot;fief-holder&quot; or &quot;trustee&quot;.

The concept of a vassal state uses the concept of personal vassalry to theorize formally hegemonic relationships between states – even those using non-personal forms of rule. Imperial states to which this terminology has been applied include, for instance: Ancient Rome, the Mongol Empire, Imperial China and the British Empire.
