<text>Clifford Alan Pickover (born August 15, 1957) is an American author, editor, and columnist in the fields of science, mathematics, science fiction, innovation, and creativity. For many years, he was employed at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown, New York, where he was editor-in-chief of the &quot;IBM Journal of Research and Development&quot;. He has been granted more than 700 U.S. patents, is an elected Fellow for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, and is author of more than 50 books, translated into more than a dozen languages.

== Life, education and career ==
Pickover graduated first in his class from Franklin and Marshall College, after completing the four-year undergraduate program in three years. He received his PhD in 1982 from Yale University&#x27;s Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, where he conducted research on X-ray scattering and protein structure.

Pickover was elected as a Fellow for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry for his &quot;significant contributions to the general public&#x27;s understanding of science, reason, and critical inquiry through their scholarship, writing, and work in the media.&quot; Other Fellows have included Carl Sagan and Isaac Asimov. He has been awarded almost 700 United States patents, and his &quot;The Math Book&quot; was winner of the 2011 Neumann Prize.

He joined IBM at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in 1982, as a member of the speech synthesis group and later worked on the design-automation workstations. For much of his career, Pickover has published technical articles in the areas of scientific visualization, computer art, and recreational mathematics.

He is currently an associate editor for the scientific journal &quot;Computers and Graphics&quot; and is an editorial board member for &quot;Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Leonardo&quot;. He is also the Brain-Strain columnist for &quot;Odyssey&quot; magazine, and, for many years, he was the Brain-Boggler columnist for &quot;Discover&quot; magazine.

Pickover has received more than 100 IBM invention achievement awards, three research division awards, and four external honor awards.

== Work ==


Pickover&#x27;s primary interest is in finding new ways to expand creativity by melding art, science, mathematics, and other seemingly disparate areas of human endeavor.
In &quot;The Math Book&quot; and his companion book &quot;The Physics Book&quot;, Pickover explains that both mathematics and physics &quot;cultivate a perpetual state of wonder about the limits of thoughts, the workings of the universe, and our place in the vast space-time landscape that we call home.&quot;
Pickover is an inventor with over 700 patents, the author of puzzle calendars, and puzzle contributor to magazines geared to children and adults. His Neoreality and Heaven Virus science-fiction series explores the fabric of reality and religion.

Pickover is author of hundreds of technical papers in diverse fields, ranging from the creative visualizations of fossil seashells, genetic sequences, cardiac and speech sounds, and virtual caverns and lava lamps, to fractal and mathematically based studies. He also has published articles in the areas of skepticism (e.g. ESP and Nostradamus), psychology (e.g. temporal lobe epilepsy and genius), and technical speculation (e.g. &quot;What if scientists had found a computer in 1900?&quot; and &quot;An informal survey on the scientific and social impact of a soda can-sized super-super computer&quot;). Additional visualization work includes topics that involve breathing motions of proteins, snow-flake like patterns for speech sounds, cartoon-face representations of data, and biomorphs.

Pickover has also written extensively on the reported experiences of people on the psychotropic compound DMT. Such apparent entities as Machine Elves are described as well as &quot;Insects From A Parallel Universe&quot;.

On November 4, 2006, he began Wikidumper.org, a popular blog featuring articles being considered for deletion by English Wikipedia.

=== Pickover stalks ===
Pickover stalks are certain kinds of details that are empirically found in the Mandelbrot set in the study of fractal geometry. In the 1980s, Pickover proposed that experimental mathematicians and computer artists examine the behavior of orbit trajectories for the Mandelbrot set in order to study how closely the orbits of interior points come to the x and y axes in the complex plane. In some renditions of this behavior, the closer that the point approaches, the higher up the color scale, with red denoting the closest approach. The logarithm of the distance is taken to accentuate the details. This work grew from his earlier work with Julia sets and &quot;Pickover biomorphs,&quot; the latter of which often resembled microbes.

=== Frontiers of Scientific Visualization ===
In &quot;Frontiers of Scientific Visualization&quot; (1994) Pickover explored &quot;the art and science of making the unseen workings of nature visible&quot;. The books contains contributions on &quot;Fluid flow, fractals, plant growth, genetic sequencing, the configuration of distant galaxies, virtual reality to artistic inspiration&quot;, and focuses on use of computers as tools for simulation, art and discovery.

=== Visualizing Biological Information ===
In &quot;Visualizing Biological Information&quot; (1995) Pickover considered &quot;biological data of all kinds, which is proliferating at an incredible rate&quot;. According to Pickover, &quot;if humans attempt to read such data in the form of numbers and letters, they will take in the information at a snail&#x27;s pace. If the information is rendered graphically, however, human analysts can assimilate it and gain insight much faster. The emphasis of this work is on the novel graphical and musical representation of information containing sequences, such as DNA and amino acid sequences, to help us find hidden pattern and meaning&quot;.

=== Vampire numbers and other mathematical highlights ===
In mathematics, a vampire number or &quot;true vampire number&quot; is a composite natural number &quot;v&quot;, with an even number of digits &quot;n&quot;, that can be factored into two integers &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; each with &quot;n&quot;/2 digits and not both with trailing zeroes, where &quot;v&quot; contains all the digits from &quot;x&quot; and from &quot;y&quot;, in any order. &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are called the &quot;fangs&quot;. As an example, 1260 is a vampire number because it can be expressed as 21 × 60 = 1260. Note that the digits of the factors 21 and 60 can be found, in some scrambled order, in 1260. Similarly, 136,948 is a vampire because 136,948 = 146 × 938.

Vampire numbers first appeared in a 1994 post by Clifford A. Pickover to the Usenet group sci.math, and the article he later wrote was published in chapter 30 of his book &quot;Keys to Infinity&quot;.

In addition to &quot;Vampire numbers&quot;,
a term Pickover actually coined, he has coined the following terms in the area of mathematics:
Leviathan number, factorion,
Carotid–Kundalini function and fractal, batrachion, Juggler sequence, and Legion&#x27;s number, among others. For characterizing noisy data, he has used Truchet tiles and Noise spheres, the later of which is a term he coined for a particular mapping, and visualization, of noisy data to spherical coordinates.

In 1990, he asked &quot;Is There a Double Smoothly Undulating Integer?&quot;, and he computed &quot;All Known Replicating Fibonacci Digits Less than One Billion&quot;. With his colleague John R. Hendricks, he was the first to compute the smallest perfect (nasik) magic tesseract. The &quot;Pickover sequence&quot; dealing with e and pi was named after him, as was the &quot;Cliff random number generator&quot; and the Pickover attractor, sometimes also referred to as the Clifford Attractor.

=== Culture, religion, belief ===

Starting in about 2001, Pickover&#x27;s books sometimes began to include topics beyond his traditional focus on science and mathematics. For example, &quot;Dreaming the Future&quot; discusses various methods of divination that humans have used since stone-age times. &quot;The Paradox of God&quot; deals with topics in religion. Perhaps the most obvious departure from his earlier works includes &quot;Sex, Drugs, Einstein, and Elves: Sushi, Psychedelics, Parallel Universes, and the Quest for Transcendence&quot;, which explores the &quot;borderlands of science&quot; and is &quot;part memoir and part surrealist perspective on culture.&quot;. Pickover follows-up his &quot;quest for transcendence&quot; and examination of popular culture with &quot;A Beginner&#x27;s Guide to Immortality: Extraordinary People, Alien Brains, and Quantum Resurrection&quot;.

=== History of science and mathematics ===

Starting in 2008, Pickover&#x27;s books began to focus on the history of science and mathematics, with such titles as &quot;Archimedes to Hawking&quot;, as well as &quot;The Math Book&quot;, &quot;The Physics Book&quot;, and &quot;The Medical Book&quot;—a trilogy of more than 1,500 pages that presents various historical milestones, breakthroughs, and curiosities.

=== WikiDumper.org ===
Wikidumper.org is a website created by Pickover that promises to permanently record a snapshot of the &quot;best of the English Wikipedia rejects&quot;, articles that are slated for deletion at the English Wikipedia. WikiDumper was launched on November 4, 2006, and accepts user submissions. Although the site doesn&#x27;t specify its criteria for inclusion, many of its articles don&#x27;t cite their sources. The site has been criticized as likely to be less accurate than English Wikipedia.

== Publications ==


Pickover is author of over forty books on such topics as computers and creativity, art, mathematics, black holes, human behavior and intelligence, time travel, alien life, Albert Einstein, religion, dimethyltryptamine elves, parallel universes, the nature of genius, and science fiction.

<doc id="268188" wikidata="Q17015569" url="?curid=268188" title="Bar (law)">
<text>In law, the bar is the legal profession as an institution. The term is a metonym for the line (or &quot;bar&quot;) that separates the parts of a courtroom reserved for spectators and those reserved for participants in a trial such as lawyers.

In the United Kingdom, the term &quot;the bar&quot; refers only to the professional organization for barristers (referred to in Scotland as advocates); the other type of UK lawyer, solicitors, have their own body, the Law Society. Correspondingly, being &quot;called to the bar&quot; refers to admission to the profession of barristers, not solicitors.

==Courtroom division==
The origin of the term &quot;bar&quot; is from the barring furniture dividing a medieval European courtroom, which defined the areas restricted to lawyers and court personnel from which the general public was excluded. Within most modern courts of the U.S., Europe and many other countries, the bar continues to be represented by a physical partition, such as a or . The area behind the bar is open to the public. This restriction is enforced in nearly all courts.

==License and certification==
&quot;The bar&quot; may also refer to the qualifying procedure by which a lawyer is licensed to practice law in a given jurisdiction.

===U.S. procedure===

In the United States, this procedure is administered by the individual U.S. states and their respective bar associations. In general, a candidate must graduate from a qualified law school and pass a written test: the &quot;bar examination&quot;. Almost all states use the Multistate Bar Examination (MBE), a multiple-choice exam administered on one day of a two- or three-day test. An increasing number use the Uniform Bar Examination, which includes the MBE. In either case, on days during which the MBE is not administered, the bar exam may include questions related to that state&#x27;s laws. If the candidate reaches the score required by a particular state, the candidate is then &quot;admitted to the bar&quot;. A lawyer whose license to practice law is revoked is said to be &quot;disbarred&quot;. 

State bar associations may set additional requirements to bar admission such as trial and court observations, character and background screenings, or an additional examination on professional ethics. 

==== U.S. patent procedure ====

Admission to practice before the patent section of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requires that the individual pass a separate, single-day examination administered by that agency. This test is typically referred to as the &quot;patent bar&quot;, although the word &quot;bar&quot; does not appear in the test&#x27;s official name.

Unlike the general bar examination, for which graduation from a recognized law school is a prerequisite, the USPTO exam does not require that the candidate have taken any law school courses. Instead, the main prerequisite is a science or engineering background, most often met with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in a relevant field. Individuals who pass the examination are referred to as &quot;patent attorneys&quot; if they have an active law license from any U.S. jurisdiction, and &quot;patent agents&quot; otherwise. Attorneys and agents have the same license to represent clients before the patent section of the USPTO, and both may issue patentability opinions. However, any other patent-related practice (such as licensing or infringement litigation) can only be performed by licensed attorneys—who do not necessarily have to be USPTO-licensed.

===British procedure===

In the United Kingdom, the practice of law is divided between barristers (advocates in Scotland) and solicitors; advocacy before a court is almost always carried out by barristers (or advocates). A person who becomes an advocate or barrister is referred to as being &quot;called to the bar&quot;. In the UK, there is a distinction between the &quot;inner bar&quot; (for senior King&#x27;s counsel) and the &quot;outer bar&quot; (for Junior barristers).

==The legal profession==
&quot;The bar&quot; commonly refers to the legal profession as a whole. With a modifier, it may refer to a branch or division of the profession: as, for instance, the &quot;tort bar&quot;—lawyers who specialize in filing civil suits for damages.

In conjunction with &quot;bench&quot;, &quot;bar&quot; may differentiate lawyers who represent clients (&quot;the bar&quot;) from judges or members of a judiciary (&quot;the bench&quot;). In this sense, the bar advocates and the bench adjudicates. Yet, in some countries, judges who previously worked as lawyers representing clients commonly remain members of the bar and lawyers are commonly referenced as &quot;Officers of the Court&quot;.

The phrase &quot;bench and bar&quot; denotes all judges and lawyers collectively.

<doc id="268194" wikidata="Q3090218" url="?curid=268194" title="Lucy Parsons">
<text>Lucy E. Parsons ( – March 7, 1942) was an American social anarchist and later anarcho-communist. Her early life is shrouded in mystery: she herself said she was of mixed Mexican and Native American ancestry; historians believe she was born to an African-American slave, possibly in Virginia, then married a black freedman in Texas. In addition to Parsons, she went by different surnames during her life including Carter, Diaz, Gonzalez and Hull. She met Albert Parsons in Waco, Texas, and claimed to have married him although no records have been found. They moved to Chicago together around 1873 and Parsons&#x27; ideology was shaped by the harsh repression of the Chicago railroad strike of 1877. She argued for labor organization and class struggle, writing polemical texts and speaking at events. She joined the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association and later the Knights of Labor, and she set up the Chicago Working Women&#x27;s Union with her friend Lizzie Swank and other women.

She had two children and worked in Chicago as a seamstress, later opening her own shop. After Albert Parsons was executed in 1887 following the Haymarket affair, she became internationally famous as an anarchist speaker, touring frequently across the United States and visiting England. She was a founding member of the Industrial Workers of the World and edited radical newspapers. She was helped financially by the Pioneer Aid and Support Association and completed &quot;The Life of Albert R. Parsons&quot; with her young lover Martin Lacher. Following the Russian Revolution in 1917, Parsons moved towards communism. She became a notorious political figure and Chicago police attempted for decades to stop her speaking publicly. She clashed with Emma Goldman over their differing attitudes to free love and continued her activism as she grew older, supporting Angelo Herndon, Tom Mooney, and the Scottsboro Boys.

Parsons died in a house fire on March 7, 1942. Her partner George Markstall returned to find the building on fire and was unable to rescue her; he died the following day. She was buried in the German Waldheim Cemetery, where the Haymarket Martyrs&#x27; Monument stands. After her death, Parsons was primarily referenced as the wife of Albert Parsons, until recent scholarship and two book-length biographies have commemorated her own achievements. The Chicago Park District named a park on Belmont Avenue after her in 2004.

==Early life==
Little is known for certain about Parsons&#x27; early life. Caroline Ashbaugh states in &quot;Lucy Parsons, American revolutionary&quot; that she was born the daughter of a slave in 1849 and was possibly called Lucy Gathings; through her life Parsons also used the surnames Carter, Diaz, Gonzalez and Hull. There is confusion over Parsons&#x27; middle name; while historians such as Philip S. Foner give it as Eldine, both the birth certificate of her daughter and her own death certificate supply the name Ella. Throughout her life, Parsons denied being of African heritage and said that she had Mexican and Native American parents, mixing up their genders. When later events made her famous, national newspapers tried to investigate her Texas heritage but were unable to do so. One story she told was that she was born in Texas to Marie del Gather (who was of Spanish-Mexican ancestry) and John Waller, a Muscogee Native American. Her entry in the &quot;American National Biography&quot; suggests she may have been daughter to Pedro Diáz González and his wife Marie. Her contemporaries remarked upon her beautiful appearance and dark hair.

In &quot;Goddess of anarchy: The life and times of Lucy Parsons, American radical&quot;, the social historian Jacqueline Jones states that Parsons was born a slave in Virginia and in 1863 at the age of 12 was brought to McLennan County, Texas, by her owner Thomas J. Taliaferro along with her mother and brother. On this account she was called Lucia; she then moved to Waco, Texas, which had been founded in 1849 and in the postwar period was a place where people were reinventing their identities as they moved on from their past lives as slaves or Confederate soldiers. The 1863 Emancipation Proclamation by Abraham Lincoln had freed enslaved African Americans and in Texas General Order No. 3 emancipated slaves on June 19, 1865. Parsons, then known as Lucia Carter, began living with (and possibly married) a black freedman called Oliver Benton, formerly known as Oliver Gathings because slaves were given the surnames of their owners. She was about 16 or 17 years old, and he was around 35 or 36. Benton paid $1.50 per month for her education at a local black school and they may have had a child together who died at a young age. Ashbaugh suggests that Parsons was (like Benton) a former slave of the Gathings brothers, since Philip Gathings had a daughter named Lucy in 1849 and Parsons may have been named after her. While slave records do not preserve names, the Gathings brothers did each own two slave girls in 1860 who would have been around Parsons&#x27; age. Parsons herself told different versions of her life history.

Lucy Gathings met the white Albert Parsons in Waco. He had fought in the American Civil War on the losing Confederate side then after the war had become a Radical Republican agitating for black civil rights. It is doubtful they were ever married since no records have been found and there were at the time anti-miscegenation laws. Both Lucy and Albert Parsons claimed that they married in Austin in 1872, while Parsons told the &quot;Dictionary of American Biography&quot; for Albert&#x27;s entry that they married on June 10, 1871. The historian Lucie C. Price was unable to find any records either of the marriage certificate or of the official whom Parsons said had recorded the marriage. The couple lived together as husband and wife, Lucy taking the last name Parsons. Lucy Parsons always opposed racism and it is likely she had witnessed the activities of the Ku Klux Klan in Waco, while Albert was shot in the leg for helping black people to register to vote.

==Moving to Chicago==
Lucy and Albert Parsons moved to Chicago in about 1873. The industrial city was growing quickly as it recovered from the 1871 Great Chicago Fire, with the population rocketing from 112,000 to 1.1 million inhabitants between 1870 and 1890. The couple lived in poor working-class slum tenements around Larrabee Street and North Avenue on the North Side. Albert Parsons worked as a compositor for newspapers and Lucy Parsons earned money as a seamstress. The couple became involved in the Social Democratic Party of North America and later the Workingmen&#x27;s Party of the United States after the dissolution of the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association (which had also been known as the First International). Parsons demonstrated her willingness to stand up for her rights by twice taking white people to court in 1875, over an unpaid bill and a neighbor disturbance, respectively.

When the Chicago railroad strike of 1877 occurred as part of the Great Upheaval, Albert Parsons at first told the crowds to remain non-violent and to vote for the Workingmen&#x27;s Party to achieve political change. Soon, all railway workers were on strike and the Chicago Board of Trade was concerned that a situation similar to the 1871 Paris Commune might develop. On July 23, Albert Parsons and fellow socialists Philip Van Patten and George Schilling spoke to a crowd of 25,000 people. He was then fired from his job at the &quot;Chicago Times&quot; and blacklisted. Armed men took him to Mayor of Chicago Monroe Heath&#x27;s office, where the police chief and angry business leaders threatened him; later that day he had gun put to his head by two unknown men when he went to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; to ask for work. Lucy Parsons was forced to get a job to support her family and started a shop selling suits and dresses. She expanded the business into Parsons &amp; Co., Manufacturers of Ladies&#x27; and Children&#x27;s Clothing, opening a workspace at 306 Mohawk Street and employing her now blacklisted partner.

Parsons&#x27; first writings to be published were letters to the editor of &quot;The Socialist&quot; concerning the hunger and poverty of the working class. She began to lecture after the birth of her son, Albert Parsons Jr., in September 1879. Her biographer Jones notes that on the birth certificate she wrote her maiden name as Carter and Virginia as her place of birth. Parsons&#x27; political perspective was evolving, and she determined that her personal problems were insignificant since only social movements could achieve change. She was more militant than her partner, campaigning against voting at a time when she did not have the right to do it herself. Her observations of the strike taught her that workers were powerful when united. She developed her social anarchist approach, in which she condoned political violence, urged self-defense against racial violence and called for class struggle against religion. Alongside women such as Elizabeth Chambers Morgan, Elizabeth Flynn Rodgers, Alzina Stevens and Lizzie Swank she helped to set up the Chicago Working Women&#x27;s Union (WWU) and attended meetings while pregnant, at a time when child-bearing women were expected to stay at home. Swank became a good friend of Parsons and as soon as the Knights of Labor decided to admit women, they both joined up. The WWU encouraged women to unionize and promoted the eight-hour day.

On April 20, 1881, Parsons gave birth to her second child, Lulu Eda, who was to die of lymphedema at the age of eight. In 1883, Johann Most visited Chicago and met the Parsons family. He was an insurrectionary anarchist who promoted propaganda of the deed. In November, Albert Parsons founded the American Group of Chicago as local part of the International Working People&#x27;s Association (IWPA), which contained five of the eight men who would later be the Haymarket affair defendants, namely himself and Samuel Fielden, Adolph Fischer, Oscar Neebe and August Spies. When it published the radical newspaper &quot;The Alarm&quot; in 1884, the four main contributors were Lucy Parsons, Albert Parsons, William Holmes and Lizzie Swank. Lucy Parsons published texts including &quot;Our Civilization. Is it Worth Saving?&quot;, &quot;The Factory Child. Their Wrongs Portrayed and Their Rescue Demanded&quot; and &quot;The Negro. Let Him Leave Politics to the Politician and Prayers to the Preacher&quot;. Her article &quot;To Tramps, the Unemployed, the Disinherited and Miserable&quot; was reprinted from &quot;The Alarm&quot; and sold more than 100,000 copies between May and November 1885. The same year Parsons published &quot;Dynamite! The only voice the oppressors of the people can understand&quot; in the &quot;Denver Labor Enquirer&quot;. She saw violence as inevitable in class struggle and also believed in trade unions as the engine of the revolution. On April 28, 1885, Parsons and Lizzie Holmes () led an IWPA march to the Board of Trade building. During this time period, Parsons and her partner would often address crowds of 500 to 1,000 people on Sundays at the shore of Lake Michigan. Labor organizer Mother Jones attended and thought the speeches advocated too much violence.

==Haymarket affair==
On Saturday May 1, 1886, 300,000 workers went on strike across the US. In Chicago, the Parsons family led a peaceful demonstration of 80,000 people down Michigan Avenue, demanding the eight-hour day. Two days later, August Spies addressed striking workers at the McCormick Reaper factory; Chicago Police and private security guards known as Pinkertons attacked the gathering, shooting at least one person dead. On May 4, Lucy Parsons organized a meeting to support striking sewing women and asked Albert Parsons to join her; on the same night, there was a protest against the recent police brutality at the nearby Haymarket Square. Albert Parsons went to the protest and took the podium to make a speech after August Spies. When the speakers had finished, 176 police officers marched into the square and ordered the demonstrators to disperse; in response, a bomb was thrown from the crowd. In an incident which became known as the Haymarket affair, the police opened fire, shooting at least seven workers dead, while one police officer died and six others succumbed to their injuries later; it is likely that in the chaos the officers were killed by police bullets. The Parsons family was at Zepf&#x27;s Hall nearby and heard the blast; Lucy urged Albert to flee the city and he first went to Geneva, Illinois to stay with Lizzie and William Holmes, then moved to Waukesha, Wisconsin where he worked as a laborer and stayed with Daniel Hoan.

On May 5, the day after the bombing, Lucy Parsons was in the office of the &quot;Arbeiter-Zeitung&quot; when it was raided by police officers without a search warrant. They arrested the entire staff including Parsons, whom an officer called &quot;a black bitch&quot;; she was released without charge since the police were hoping she would lead them to her partner. Over the next six months she was briefly detained several times. Other mass arrests and unlawful searches were made and Julius S. Grinnell, the Illinois Attorney General who would go on to prosecute the case, said &quot;Make the raids first then look up the law afterwards&quot;. Lucy Parsons reported in the &quot;Denver Labor Enquirer&quot;: &quot;They have invaded the homes of everyone who has ever been known to have raised a voice or sympathized with those who have had aught to say against the present system of robbery and oppression&quot;. A Grand Jury announced charges against 31 men on May 27, including murder charges against ten. Lizzie Holmes was not charged since prosecutors did not want to cause a scandal by sentencing a woman to death. All but one of the men were members of the Central Labor Union and the most fervent advocates of propaganda by the deed (including Lucy Parsons and Lizzie Holmes) had not been charged.

The attitude of the US labor movement towards those accused was mixed, with some militants voicing support and others concerned by the loss of life at the square. While Albert was in hiding, he wrote to Lucy Parsons asking her to talk to the lawyer William P. Black and discuss the conditions of his surrender. Black encouraged her to bring him to court, believing there was little chance of conviction. His chief aide William A. Foster disagreed, thinking it best that Parsons remained free. On the first day of trial, Albert Parsons appeared after spending some hours with Lucy and surrendered to Judge Joseph Gary. The mainstream media campaign against anarchists was intense, with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; calling for executions and Texas newspapers revisiting the presumed scandal of Parsons leaving her marriage with Oliver Benton for Albert. The &quot;Waco Day&quot; headlined a story &quot;Beast Parsons: the sneaking snarl from some moral morass in which he hides; miscegenationist, murderer, moral outlaw, for whom the gallows waits&quot;. In response, Parsons visited her partner in jail with a journalist from the &quot;Tribune&quot; and he said he had been romantically attached to Benton&#x27;s wife but that she was a different person to Lucy. 

Lucy Parsons attended every day of the trial and was there when her partner, George Engel, Fielden, Fischer, Louis Lingg, Michael Schwab and Spies were sentenced to death. Afterwards, she made a seven-week lecture tour in order to raise funds for the defense committee; she addressed more than 200,000 people in places such as Cincinnati, New York and Philadelphia. In New Haven, Connecticut, she said &quot;You may have expected me to belch forth great flames of dynamite and stand before you with bombs in my hands. If you are disappointed, you have only the capitalist press to thank for it&quot;. She spoke with the socialist Thomas J. Morgan at a rally in Sheffield, Indiana, which was just across the state line from Illinois, so that the Chicago police were unable to stop the event. In Columbus, Ohio, she was prevented from speaking and sent by the mayor to Franklin County Jail. When not lecturing, Parsons would visit her partner in jail, taking the children with her. She stopped her tailoring shop and the family was forced to move out of their Indiana Street apartment to another on Milwaukee Avenue. After his death sentence was announced, Albert Parsons wrote to his wife &quot;I have one request to make of you: Commit no rash act to yourself when I am gone, but take up the great cause of Socialism where I am compelled to lay it down.&quot; An Amnesty Association was founded and took action to save Albert Parsons and the six other men on death row; Lucy Parsons spent her time fundraising and collecting signatures on the street, and the campaign to commute the sentences was supported even by those such as Melville Elijah Stone, editor of the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;, who had previously condemned the anarchists.

On Thursday November 10, Louis Lingg was either murdered or committed suicide in his cell. In the evening Governor of Illinois Richard J. Oglesby announced that of the other men condemned to death, Fielden and Schwab would have their sentences commuted to life imprisonment and Engel, Fischer, Parsons and Spies would be executed the next day. On the morning of Parsons&#x27; execution, Lucy Parsons took the children to see him for the last time, accompanied by Lizzie Holmes. Despite being promised by a deputy sheriff the day before that she would gain access, she was prevented from entering the jail by a police cordon. When she attempted to cross the cordon, the group was arrested and taken to the Chicago Avenue police station where they were strip-searched for explosives and detained until 15:00. The casket containing the corpse of Albert Parsons was taken to Lucy Parsons&#x27; shop, where over 10,000 people came to pay respects in one day. A total of between 10,000 and 15,000 people attended the funeral on Sunday, November 13; Parsons walked behind the casket. Twenty years later, she edited and published &quot;The Famous Speeches of the Eight Chicago Anarchists in Court: When asked if they had anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon them: October 7, 8, and 9, 1886&quot; which sold more than 10,000 copies in 18 months.

==Continued activism==

After the funeral of her partner, Parsons continued her political activism. The Pioneer Aid and Support Association gave her a stipend of $12 per week and in March 1888 she toured the East Coast making speeches. During the 1887 Chicago mayoral election, Parsons supported the United Labor Party candidate against the eventual victor, Republican John A. Roche. Roche framed the contest as a battle between the US flag and the flags of anarchism and communism, later attempting to ban the use of red flags at left-wing meetings. Parsons began to work on the book which she later published as &quot;The Life of Albert R. Parsons&quot;. She was helped by Martin Lacher, a young German who lived with her from 1889 onwards. In October 1888, she took the boat to London, where she met anarchists Peter Kropotkin and William Morris and visited the Tower of London and Westminster Abbey with Jane Morris. She addressed the Socialist League and clashed with Annie Besant, a leader of the matchgirls&#x27; strike, over the issue of violence. When she arrived back in New York City by boat, a reporter interviewed her and then claimed that she was getting married to the German democratic socialist Eduard Bernstein. Parsons&#x27; anarchist contemporaries such as Justus Schwab condemned the story and she denied it.

After Parsons returned to Chicago in 1889, the newly renamed Albert R. Parsons Assembly of the Knights of Labor publicized a forthcoming lecture by her entitled Review of the Labor Movement in Europe. Chicago police chief George W. Hubbard resolved to stop the event and on the day itself, Lacher and another man were arrested as they protested for Parsons&#x27; right to speak. Hubbard announced that &quot;she simply can&#x27;t speak in Chicago&quot; and repeatedly stopped events occurring. The same year, Parsons published &quot;The Life of Albert R. Parsons&quot; with a foreword by George Schilling. In November 1890, Johann Most, Parsons and Hugh O. Pentecost were prevented from speaking in Newark, New Jersey when the police closed the hall. Parsons then attempted to speak on the street: she was arrested and charged with incitement to riot. Parsons edited the newspaper &quot;Freedom, a revolutionary anarchist-communist monthly&quot; from 1891 onwards. Parsons built a house at 999 Hammond Avenue, later North Troy Street in Avondale, with the aid of the Pioneer Aid and Support Association, but some members of the group began to resent her need for funds, alleging that she was still claiming a stipend for her daughter who had died. Her relationship with Lacher was controversial since he remained married to someone else. The couple were by 1890 seen together publicly until their relationship ended in a court battle, when Parsons accused him of attacking her household belongings with an axe. Lacher admitted destroying furniture but argued it belonged to him; he was fined $25 plus costs for disorderly conduct. He also alleged that he had written the majority of the &quot;Life of Albert R. Parsons&quot;. Parsons used her position as editor of &quot;Freedom&quot; to attack Lacher, claiming he had stolen money from a local group and was pursuing a vendetta against her.

As Parsons grew older, there were events to mark the anniversary of the Haymarket affair and the police continued to stop her addressing these and other meetings. When the anarchist Alexander Berkman attempted to assassinate the industrialist Henry Clay Frick in 1892, Parsons wrote in &quot;Freedom&quot; &quot;For our part we have only the greatest admiration for a hero like Berkman&quot; and she supported her friends Henry Bauer and Carl Nold who were arrested on conspiracy charges despite not being involved. Berkman was handed a sentence of 22 years and Nold and Bauer each received five years. In 1893, Parsons negotiated with the mayor that she could speak on the condition that she did not denounce him, then took the stage and immediately said the mayor was no better than a czar. In August 1896, her house burned down and her stock of books was damaged, although she later sold fire-damaged copies of &quot;Anarchism: Its Philosophy and Scientific Basis&quot; and &quot;The Life of Albert R. Parsons&quot;.

Parsons was attracted to the activism of the Social Democracy of America, led by Eugene V. Debs, and met Emma Goldman through the group in 1897. While Goldman promoted free love, emancipation for women and the freedom of the individual, Parsons (despite having extra-marital sex in her private life) publicly endorsed monogamy, marriage and motherhood, and she still believed in the primacy of the struggle of the working class as a whole. At the time Goldman, Parsons and Louise Michel were amongst a small cohort of women who were internationally famous as anarchists and labor activists. When Oscar Rotter wrote about free love and the destruction of property relations in the anarchist newspaper &quot;Free Society&quot;, Parsons responded angrily in support of monogamy and this led to a long-lasting feud with Goldman, who complained that Parsons was living off her executed partner&#x27;s legacy. Parsons opposed both the Spanish–American War and the Philippine–American War; after her son Albert Jr. attempted to enlist, she had him committed to the Northern Illinois State Mental Hospital in 1899; he remained there for the rest of his life, dying in 1919 of tuberculosis.

== 1900s ==

Parsons was visited by anarchist Errico Malatesta in 1900 and the same year made a speech alongside trade unionist Jay Fox at a picnic on Memorial Day. By that time, Parsons was the Chicago correspondent for &quot;Free Society&quot; which had its printing press destroyed by the police following the assassination of President William McKinley. In 1905, Parsons set up the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) with Eugene V. Debs, Bill Haywood and Mother Jones. She continued to tour the US making speeches and selling pamphlets, while editing the radical newspapers &quot;The Liberator&quot; and &quot;The Alarm&quot;. She was often prevented from speaking by the police, particularly in Chicago, yet she continued to lecture until the 1920s. Around 1912, she was involved with the Syndicalist League of North America, which was led by William Z. Foster.
After Parsons spoke at a January 1915 hunger march in Chicago which ended in 1,500 unemployed people fighting with the police near Hull House on Halsted Street, she was arrested alongside Father Irwin St. John Tucker and 19 other people. Following the Russian Revolution in 1917, Parsons moved towards communism. She later wrote to Carl Nold that the communists were &quot;the only bunch who are making a vigorous protest against the present horrible conditions!&quot; and lamented that &quot;anarchism is a dead issue in American life today&quot;. She became involved with the International Labor Defense and in 1930, she spoke to thousands of people at the May Day (International Workers&#x27; Day) event at Ashland Auditorium in Chicago, making a speech that was reprinted in &quot;Hearings Before a Special Committee to Investigate Communist Activities in the U.S.&quot;. In a continuance of their rivalry, Emma Goldman criticized her for jumping from one revolutionary cause to the next. Parsons finally joined the Communist Party in 1939.

Parsons suffered an attack of pleurisy in 1932, recovering enough to visit the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair the following year. She was despondent about the US anarchist movement, discussing its failure with friends such as Nord, yet she continued her activism, supporting Angelo Herndon, Tom Mooney and the Scottsboro Boys. She went blind, received a pension and lived in poverty in Avondale at North Troy Street with a library of around 3,000 books which featured the work of Engels, French socialists, Victor Hugo, Jack London, Marx, Rousseau, Leo Tolstoy and Voltaire.

==Death==

On her last May Day in 1941, Parsons accompanied the Farm Equipment Workers&#x27; Organizing Committee as guest of honor. At the age of around 91, she died in a house fire on March 7, 1942. Her long-term partner George Markstall returned to find the building on fire and was unable to rescue her; he died of his injuries the next day. Parsons had spoken to Ben Reitman about her funeral and drawn up a will in 1938, leaving the house to Markstall and upon his death to the Pioneer Aid and Support Association. Her will was declared invalid, and the building was sold for $800 in 1943. The fire had destroyed part of her library, but many books remained undamaged; when a friend went to the house to save the books, he discovered that only burnt copies remained. He asked the police where the library had gone and was told the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had taken it. The FBI denied any knowledge of the books and when Reitman asked the head of the Chicago Red Squad, he was told the FBI had them; the books were not recovered. Years later, a signed copy of William Morris&#x27; &quot;The Signs of Change: Seven Lectures&quot; with the dedication &quot;To Lucy E. Parsons, from William Morris, Nov. 15th 1888&quot; was put up for sale, bearing stamps from the Library of Congress and the FBI.

A memorial service for Parsons and Markstall was attended by 300 people on March 12. Reitman spoke, calling her &quot;the last of the dinosaurs, that brave group of Chicago Anarchists.&quot; Parsons was buried in the German Waldheim Cemetery, where the Haymarket Martyrs Monument stands. Voltairine de Cleyre and Emma Goldman are also buried there.

==Legacy==

Parsons&#x27; fellow activist Elizabeth Gurley Flynn remembered her as a passionate speaker and revolutionary. The philosopher Ruth Kinna noted in her 2020 book &quot;Great Anarchists&quot; that Parsons has historically been referred to primarily as the wife of Albert Parsons, yet she was in fact a &quot;talented writer, orator and organizer in her own right&quot;. Until Ashbaugh&#x27;s 1976 biography, Parsons was often only mentioned in footnotes: more recently coverage of her career has increased. She has been claimed by various left-wing groups as a figurehead and a self-managed social center in Boston was named after her.

Historians have criticised Parsons&#x27; lack of interest in the struggles of African Americans, with her stance reflecting a belief in the need for the working class generally to rise up against its employers, rather than appealing to the need for racial equality. One explanation is that since she denied her own black heritage, she focused more on class struggle. As a result, she did not work with the contemporaneous black Chicago activist Ida Wells-Barnett, nor the National Association of Colored Women and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Historians have also focused on the question of Parsons&#x27; specific political affiliations, while at the time labels were more fluid and Albert Parsons wrote: &quot;We are called by some Communists, or Socialists, or Anarchists. We accept all three of the terms.&quot;

Parsons is one of the historical figures depicted in Annalee Newitz&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;The Future of Another Timeline&quot;, part of which is set in Chicago in the 1890s. 

The Chicago Park District named a small area on Belmont Avenue the &quot;Lucy Ella Gonzales Parsons&quot; park in 2004, a decision which was opposed by the Fraternal Order of Police. In 2022, a new housing development in Logan Square, Chicago with 100 percent affordable units was named the Lucy Gonzalez Parsons Apartments.

A historical marker dedicated to Lucy and her husband Albert was erected in 1997 by the City of Chicago at the location of their home, 1908 North Mohawk Street, in the Old Town neighborhood.

<text>William Ernst Trautmann (July 1, 1869 – November 18, 1940) was an American trade unionist who was the founding general-secretary of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and one of six people who initially laid plans for the organization in 1904.

He was born to German parents in New Zealand in 1869 and raised in Europe. After completing a brewing apprenticeship in Poland, he worked as a masterbrewer in Germany before being expelled for labor activities under Bismark&#x27;s anti-socialist laws. In 1890 he moved to the United States, where he joined the Beer Brewers Union. Trautmann was a key figure in the United Brewery Workers&#x27; Union in Milwaukee and the editor of the United Brewery Workers&#x27; German-language newspaper, &quot;Brauer Zeitung&quot;. He was expelled from that union for his participation in the founding IWW convention. In 1905, he joined with other industrial unionists to found the Industrial Workers of the World. Between 1905 and 1912, he mostly worked in the field as an organizer. In 1912, he broke with the IWW leadership over strike tactics and the alleged misuse of funds collected for the &quot;Bread and Roses&quot; strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts. In 1913, Trautmann joined the so-called yellow IWW created by the Socialist Labor Party, which later became the Workers&#x27; International Industrial Union (WIIU), as a &quot;full-time propagandist.&quot;

In 1922, Trautmann published a novel, &quot;Riot&quot;, drawing on his experiences as an IWW activist during the Pressed Steel Car Strike of 1909 in McKees Rocks (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania).

==Early life==
Born in New Zealand into a German-American miner family in 1869. His father died when Trautmann was four years of age. When he was 14 he and his mother moved back to Europe where he worked as an apprentice to a brewer in Poland. At this brewery he had to work as many as hours as his brewmaster told him. It was during this time that Trautmann was exposed to the radical labor ideas that would become his life&#x27;s work. Trautmann worked throughout Eastern Europe before settling in Germany. In Germany he was a vocal supporter of workers going through the same abuse in the brewing industry that he had gone through. In 1890 he was forced to leave Germany under the new anti-Socialist laws, which marked him as a dangerous radical. He decided to move to the United States as he already had family there. He moved to Massachusetts and continued to organize labor. He was very active in the United Brewery Worker Union. He was also very vocal against the American Federation of Labor, who he saw as being too conservative and not looking out for the interest of the worker.

==Time in IWW==
Trautmann was one of the founders of the Industrial Workers of the World. He helped write the Industrial Union Manifesto, one of the IWW&#x27;s founding documents. While in the Industrial Workers of the World Trautmann worked as an organizer, propagandist, and for some time as secretary-treasurer. He was much more known for his essays than for his administrative skills. His works include One Big Union, Why Strikes are Lost &amp; How to Win, and Industrial Unionism: The Hope of the Workers. He was thrust into a leadership role with the resignation of Eugene Debs from the union, and while he was a skilled writer his administrative skills were lacking. He could not keep a record of the members of the union (that is both the individuals and the different local branches of the IWW), and at the 1906 IWW convention, it was discovered that Trautmann had not been keeping a financial record for the entire year.

His start in the IWW was also met with turbulent times. He failed many of his first attempts at organizing strikes. He switched his tactics to target primarily Eastern European immigrants, since he was also one. This lead him to the McKees Rocks strike, a strike in a steel town of Pennsylvania. Trautmann tried to keep the protests peaceful, but soon violence erupted. Five state troopers were killed, and Trautmann was arrested. Thousands of workers threatened to riot if he was not released, and their demands met. Eventually the factory operators met the workers&#x27; demands and Trautmann achieved his first labor victory.

Trautmann was also a part of the schisms that happened during the 1910s in the IWW. In 1906 Trautmann, and his allies Vincent St. John, and Daniel DeLeon found themselves at odds with the President of the IWW, Charles Sherman. Sherman had a more conservative view (as far as unions went) and many in the IWW feared that he would allow the union to become more of an AFL type. Some members thought that Sherman would try to work within the confines of the capitalist system rather than trying to change the system as many in the IWW were trying to do. Trautmann and his allies were a proponent of &quot;direct action&quot;, the use of strikes and sabotage to achieve the aims of the union. The Trautmann faction was able to rally enough to support to outvote Sherman and his supporters, and were able to take control of the IWW.

With an even greater leadership role in the union Trautmann was soon seen as being out of his depth. He was replaced as an administrator by St. John. This allowed Trautmann to be a field organizer, a job that suited him much better. He was involved in the Lawrence Strike of 1912. Despite its success Tratumann no longer believed that the direct action approach of the IWW was the right idea, and in 1913, after a brief stint in DeLeon&#x27;s Yellow IWW, he left the union for good.

==Post IWW Life==
Trautmann wrote a historical novel entitled &quot;Riot&quot; that was based on his experiences organizing the McKees Rocks strike. He abandoned radical politics and wrote &quot;America&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; in which he said, &quot;Millions of toilers are today agreed that not capitalism, not the employers of labor as a class, are the enemies of the workers so much as those who, claiming to spring from the ranks of the proletariat, have become the apostles of corruption, the promoters of crime, the fomentors of chaos and destruction.&quot; He instead promoted peaceful labor reform, eventually ending up in Los Angeles where he worked on his autobiography and a New Deal highway project until his death in 1940.

<text>The 188th &quot;Barak&quot; (Lightning) Armored Brigade is an Israeli armoured brigade, subordinate to Israel&#x27;s Northern Regional Command. The emblem of the Barak Armored Brigade is a red-bordered rhombus bearing a sword against a blue and white background depicting the Haifa coastline. The brigade has a long history beginning before the foundation of the State of Israel.

In 1990 the brigade was the first to adopt the Merkava mark-III main battle tank, phasing out its older Centurion tanks.
The brigade phased out the mark-III in 2020 in favor of the mark-IVs.

==History==


The brigade was formed as the 2nd Brigade during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war when it was split off from the Levanoni Brigade. Named the Carmeli Brigade because it was led by Moshe Carmel, the brigade was an infantry formation operating in northern Israel. It played an important part in Operation Hiram. After the IDF was formed, the Carmeli Brigade became its 18th Brigade.

During the Sinai Campaign of 1956, the brigade was stationed along the Jordanian border, in case the Jordanians decided to open a second front, and so was not involved in combat.
It was shortly later assigned armoured units to become the 45th Armored Brigade, also known as the &quot;Barak Armored Brigade&quot;. It consisted of one tank battalion, two armoured infantry battalions, a mortar battalion and reconnaissance units. The changeover was completed in 1962.

During the Yom Kippur War, it played an important role in defending Israel&#x27;s border against the Syrian attack in the southern Golan Heights. 112 soldiers were killed in action, including the brigade commander. The brigade was almost destroyed. The main Syrian attack at 2:30–2:50 PM, confronted by the newly positioned 74th Tank Battalion, under the command of Lt.Col. Yair Nafshi. Nafshi moved his battalion position 1.5 km forward from its previous defensive position, a maneuver that saved his men and machines from the Syrian artillery barrage.

His was the only remaining tank force, equipped with 36 Israeli modified Centurion tanks to fight the Syrians for 3 continuous days until reinforcements and reserves were moved into positions. His battalion was reinforced with a tank company from the 53rd battalion. After 4 days of fighting, his battalion was reduced to 5 operational tanks. More than 102 soldiers and officers died defending the southern Golan Line, from reinforced points (bunkers) 107 to 114. For his gallant, professional, and courageous behaviour during the war, Yair Nafshi received Israel&#x27;s second-highest decoration, the Medal of Valor. He retired from the army with the rank of Brigadier General.

During the battle, Lieutenant Zvika Greengold, who had arrived unattached to any unit, fought off attacks with his single tank until help arrived. &quot;For the next 20 hours, Zvika Force, as he came to be known on the radio net, fought running battles with Syrian tanks—sometimes alone, sometimes as part of a larger unit, changing tanks half a dozen times as they were knocked out. He was wounded and burned but stayed in action and repeatedly showed up at critical moments from an unexpected direction to change the course of a skirmish.

After the war, the task of rebuilding the brigade was assigned in part to Yonatan Netanyahu who took command of Battalion 71. In the 1982 Lebanon War, it fought in Beirut and participated in the capture of the local airport. Today, the brigade is part of the 36th Armored Division, the largest regular-service armoured division in the IDF.

During 2014 Gaza War, the unit saw deployment in Gaza City.

During the 2023 Gaza War, the unit saw deployment in Bureij.

<text>Bath and North East Somerset (B&amp;NES) is a unitary authority district in Somerset, South West England. Bath and North East Somerset Council was created on 1 April 1996 following the abolition of the county of Avon. It is part of the ceremonial county of Somerset.

The unitary authority provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within the district, including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service. Its administrative headquarters is in Bath, though many departments are based at offices in Keynsham. The air ambulance and critical care service is provided by the charity Great Western Air Ambulance Charity.

Bath and North East Somerset covers an area of , of which two thirds is green belt. It stretches from the outskirts of Bristol, south into the Mendip Hills and east to the southern Cotswold Hills and Wiltshire border. The city of Bath is the principal settlement in the district, but B&amp;NES also covers Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Radstock, Westfield, Saltford and the Chew Valley.

The area has varied geography including river valleys and rolling hills. The history of human habitation is long but expanded massively during Roman times, and played significant roles in the Saxon era and English Civil War. Industry developed from a largely agricultural basis to include coal mining with the coming of canals and railways. Bath developed as a spa resort in Georgian times and remains a major cultural tourism centre having gained World Heritage City status.

==History==
Although B&amp;NES was only created in 1996 the area it covers has been occupied for thousands of years. The age of the henge monument at Stanton Drew stone circles is unknown, but is believed to be from the Neolithic period, as is the chambered tomb known as Stoney Littleton Long Barrow. Solsbury Hill has an Iron Age hill fort. The hills around Bath such as Bathampton Down saw human activity from the Mesolithic period. Several Bronze Age round barrows were opened by John Skinner in the 18th century. Bathampton Camp may have been a univallate Iron Age hill fort or stock enclosure. A long barrow site believed to be from the Beaker people was flattened to make way for RAF Charmy Down.
The archaeological evidence shows that the site of the Roman Baths&#x27; main spring was treated as a shrine by the Celts, and was dedicated to the goddess Sulis, whom the Romans identified with Minerva; however, the name Sulis continued to be used after the Roman invasion, leading to Bath&#x27;s Roman name of &quot;Aquae Sulis&quot; (literally, &quot;the waters of Sulis&quot;).

Excavations carried out before the flooding of Chew Valley Lake also uncovered Roman remains, indicating agricultural and industrial activity from the second half of the first century until the third century AD. The finds included a moderately large villa at Chew Park, where wooden writing tablets (the first in the UK) with ink writing were found. There is also evidence from the Pagans Hill Roman Temple at Chew Stoke, and a villa at Keynsham.

The Saxon advance from the east seems to have been halted by battles between the British and Saxons, for example; at the siege of Badon Mons Badonicus (which may have been in the Bath region e.g. at Solsbury Hill), or Bathampton Down. This area became the border between the Romano-British Celts and the West Saxons following the Battle of Deorham in 577 AD. The Western Wandsdyke was probably built during the 5th or 6th century. The ditch is on the north side, so presumably it was used by the Celts as a defence against Saxons encroaching from the upper Thames valley. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, the Saxon Cenwalh achieved a breakthrough against the British Celtic tribes, with victories at Bradford-on-Avon (in the &quot;Avon Gap&quot; in the Wansdyke) in 652 AD. In 675, Osric, King of the Hwicce, set up a monastic house at Bath, probably using the walled area as its precinct. King Offa of Mercia gained control of this monastery in 781 and rebuilt the church, which was dedicated to St. Peter. In the ninth century the old Roman street pattern had been lost and it had become a royal possession, with King Alfred laying out the town afresh, leaving its south-eastern quadrant as the abbey precinct. Edgar of England was crowned king of England in Bath Abbey in 973.
===11th to 16th centuries===
King William Rufus granted the city to a royal physician, John of Tours, who became Bishop of Wells and Abbot of Bath in 1088. It was papal policy for bishops to move to more urban seats, and he translated his own from Wells to Bath. He planned and began a much larger church as his cathedral, to which was attached a priory, with the bishop&#x27;s palace beside it. New baths were built around the three springs. Later bishops, however, returned the episcopal seat to Wells, while retaining the name of Bath in their title as the Bishop of Bath and Wells. The priory at Hinton Charterhouse was founded in 1232 by Ela, Countess of Salisbury who also founded Lacock Abbey.

By the 15th century, Bath&#x27;s abbey church was badly dilapidated and in need of repairs. Oliver King, Bishop of Bath and Wells, decided in 1500 to rebuild it on a smaller scale. The new church was completed just a few years before Bath Priory was dissolved in 1539 by Henry VIII. The abbey church was allowed to become derelict before being restored as the city&#x27;s parish church in the Elizabethan period, when the city revived as a spa. The baths were improved and the city began to attract the aristocracy. Bath was granted city status by Royal Charter by Queen Elizabeth I in 1590.

Keynsham, said to be named after Saint Keyne, developed into a medieval market town, its growth prompted by the foundation of an influential and prosperous abbey, founded by the Victorine order of Augustinian monks around 1170. It survived until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539 and a house was built on the site. The remains have been designated as Grade I listed by English Heritage.

===17th century onwards===
During the English Civil War, Somerset, which was largely Parliamentarian, was the site of a number of important battles between the Royalists and the Parliamentarians. The Battle of Lansdowne was fought on 5 July 1643 on the northern outskirts of the city.

In 1668 Thomas Guidott, who had been a student of chemistry and medicine at Wadham College, Oxford, moved to Bath and set up practice. He became interested in the curative properties of the waters and in 1676 he wrote &quot;A discourse of Bathe, and the hot waters there. Also, Some Enquiries into the Nature of the water&quot;. This brought the health-giving properties of the hot mineral waters to the attention of the country and soon the aristocracy started to arrive to partake in them. Several areas of the city underwent development during the Stuart period, and this increased during Georgian times in response to increasing numbers of people visiting the spa and resort town and requiring accommodation. The architects John Wood the elder and his son John Wood the younger laid out the new quarters in streets and squares, the identical facades of which gave an impression of palatial scale and classical decorum providing a unique set of buildings and architecture. The creamy gold of Bath stone further unified the city, much of it obtained from the limestone Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines, which were owned by Ralph Allen (1694–1764). Allen, in order to advertise the quality of his quarried limestone, commissioned the elder John Wood to build him a country house on his Prior Park estate between the city and the mines.

In north Somerset, around Radstock mining in the Somerset coalfield was an important industry, and in an effort to reduce the cost of transporting the coal the Somerset Coal Canal was built; part of it was later converted into a railway. It connected to the Kennet and Avon Canal which linked the River Thames at Reading and the Floating Harbour at Bristol, joining the River Avon at Bath via Bath Locks. The Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway connected Bath and Bournemouth. It was jointly operated by the Midland Railway and the London and South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR). After the 1 January 1923 Grouping, joint ownership of the S&amp;D passed to the LMS and the Southern Railway.

The area was also served by the Bristol and North Somerset Railway that connected Bristol with towns in the Somerset coalfield. The line was opened in 1873 between Bristol and Radstock, where it joined with an earlier freight-only line from Frome. The biggest civil engineering project on the line was the Pensford Viaduct over the River Chew. The viaduct is 995 feet long, reaches a maximum height of 95 feet to rail level and consists of 16 arches. It is now a Grade II listed building. Freight services on the branch ceased in 1951. The line achieved some fame after closure by its use in the film The Titfield Thunderbolt, but the track was taken up in 1958.

During World War II, between the evening of 25 April and the early morning of 27 April 1942, Bath suffered three air raids in reprisal for RAF raids on the German cities of Lübeck and Rostock. The three raids formed part of the Luftwaffe campaign popularly known as the Baedeker Blitz; over 400 people were killed, and more than 19,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed. Houses in the Royal Crescent, Circus and Paragon were burnt out along with the Assembly Rooms, while the south side of Queen Square was destroyed. All have since been reconstructed.

The River Chew suffered a major flood in 1968 with serious damage to towns and villages along its route, including Chew Stoke, Chew Magna, Stanton Drew, Publow, Woollard, Compton Dando and Chewton Keynsham. The flood even swept away the bridge at Pensford.

==Geography==
Bath and North East Somerset covers an area of , of which two thirds is green belt. It stretches from the outskirts of Bristol, south into the Mendip Hills and east to the southern Cotswold Hills and Wiltshire border. Surrounding local government areas include Bristol, North Somerset, Somerset, South Gloucestershire, and Wiltshire.

The city of Bath is the principal settlement in the district, but B&amp;NES also covers Keynsham, Midsomer Norton, Radstock and the Chew Valley. Bath lies on the River Avon and its tributaries such as the River Chew and Midford Brook cross the area.

In the west of the area the Chew Valley consists of the valley of the River Chew and is generally low-lying and undulating. It is bounded by higher ground ranging from Dundry Down to the north, the Lulsgate Plateau to the west, the Mendip Hills to the south and the Hinton Blewett, Marksbury and Newton St Loe plateau areas to the east. The River Chew was dammed in the 1950s to create Chew Valley Lake, which provides drinking water for the nearby city of Bristol and surrounding areas. The lake is a prominent landscape feature of the valley, a focus for recreation, and is internationally recognised for its nature conservation interest, because of the bird species, plants and insects.

To the north of Bath are Lansdown, Langridge and Solsbury hills. These are outliers of the Cotswolds.

==Governance==

Historically part of the county of Somerset, Bath was made a county borough in 1889 so being independent of the newly created administrative Somerset county council, which covered the rest of the area that became B&amp;NES. The area that would become B&amp;NES became part of Avon when that non-metropolitan county was created in 1974. Since the abolition of Avon in 1996, Bath has been the main centre of the district of Bath and North East Somerset (B&amp;NES), one of the four authorities that replaced Avon County Council and the six district councils of Avon. B&amp;NES covers the combined areas of the non-metropolitan districts (that existed 1974 to 1996) of Wansdyke and Bath.

Before the Reform Act of 1832 Bath elected two members to the unreformed House of Commons. Bath now has a single parliamentary constituency, with Liberal Democrat Wera Hobhouse as Member of Parliament. The rest of the area falls within the Frome and East Somerset and North East Somerset and Hanham constituencies. Previously most of the area was in the Wansdyke constituency, which covers the part of B&amp;NES that is not in the Bath constituency. It also contained four wards or parts of wards from South Gloucestershire Council. It was named after the former Wansdyke district.

Since B&amp;NES was created, until 2015, no political party had been in overall control of the council. The Liberal Democrats quickly became the dominant party, but in the local elections on 3 May 2007 the Conservative Party won 31 seats and became the largest party, though they did not have a majority. In the 2011 local elections, the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives won 29 seats each with the Labour Party winning only five seats; the Liberal Democrats went on to form a minority administration. In 2015, the Conservative Party became the first party to secure a majority, with 37 seats. The Liberal Democrats subsequently took majority control of the council in 2019, and increased their majority again in 2023.

The current council composes of 59 councillors, 28 from Bath, 6 each from the Norton Radstock and Keynsham areas, and 19 others. The current political division after the election of May 2023 is:


Local concerns include the building of a new road for buses on Conservation Area land as part of the Bath Transportation Package, the closure of a Bath Secondary School to remove excess places, economic difficulties in the Norton Radstock area, development of the large Western Riverside brownfield land site in Bath, and the now popular, but long delayed Thermae Bath Spa development. On 10 December 2003, Bath and North East Somerset was granted Fairtrade Zone status.

Between 2000 and 2014, Bath and North East Somerset Council ran a youth democracy group, Democratic Action for B&amp;NES Youth (DAFBY). The group was consulted by the council and its partners on issues that affected young people.
===Elected mayor===
Following a successful petition, a referendum was held on 10 March 2016 proposing a directly elected mayor for Bath and North East Somerset. However, the majority of voters in the district opted to stay with the current system.

===Parishes===
The area of the city of Bath, which was formerly the Bath county borough, is unparished. The fifteen electoral wards of Bath are: Bathwick, Combe Down, Kingsmead, Lambridge, Lansdown, Moorlands, Newbridge, Odd Down, Oldfield Park, Southdown, Twerton, Walcot, Westmoreland, Weston and Widcombe &amp; Lyncombe. These wards are co-extensive with the city, except that Newbridge includes also two parishes beyond the city boundary.

==Demography==

170,238 people live in the area and approximately half live in the City of Bath making it 12 times more densely populated than the rest of the area.

According to the UK Government&#x27;s 2001 census, Bath, together with North East Somerset, which includes areas around Bath as far as the Chew Valley, has a population of 169,040, with an average age of 39.9 (the national average being 38.6). According to the same statistics, the district is overwhelmingly populated by people of a white ethnic background at 97.2% – significantly higher than the national average of 90.9%. Other non-white ethnic groups in the district, in order of population size, are multiracial at 1%, Asian at 0.5% and black at 0.5% (the national averages are 1.3%, 4.6% and 2.1%, respectively).

The district is largely Christian at 71%, with no other religion reaching more than 0.5%. These figures generally compare with the national averages, though the non-religious, at 19.5%, are significantly more prevalent than the national 14.8%. Although Bath is known for the restorative powers of its waters, and only 7.4% of the population describe themselves as &quot;not healthy&quot; in the last 12 months, compared to a national average of 9.2%; only 15.8% of the inhabitants say they have had a long-term illness, as against 18.2% nationally.

==Transport==
Bath is approximately south-east of the larger city and port of Bristol, to which it is linked by the A4 road, and is a similar distance south of the M4 motorway. Bath and North East Somerset is also served by the A37 and A368 trunk roads, and a network of smaller roads. Bath is also south-west of Chippenham, and south-west of Corsham.

Bath is connected to Bristol and the sea by the River Avon, navigable via locks by small boats. The river was connected to the River Thames and London by the Kennet &amp; Avon Canal in 1810 via Bath Locks; this waterway – closed for many years, but restored in the last years of the 20th century – is now popular with narrow boat users. Bath is on National Cycle Route 4, with one of Britain&#x27;s first cycleways, the Bristol &amp; Bath Railway Path, to the west, and an eastern route toward London on the canal towpath. Although Bath does not have an airport, the city is about from Bristol Airport, which may be reached by road or by rail via Bristol Temple Meads station.

Bath is served by the Bath Spa railway station (designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel), which has regular connections to London Paddington, Bristol Temple Meads, Cardiff Central, Swansea, Exeter St Davids, Plymouth and Penzance (see Great Western Main Line), and also Westbury, Warminster, Frome, Salisbury, Southampton Central, Portsmouth Harbour and Brighton (see Wessex Main Line). Services are provided by Great Western Railway. There are suburban stations on the main line at Oldfield Park and Keynsham which have a limited commuter service to Bristol. Green Park station was once operated by the Somerset &amp; Dorset Joint Railway, whose line (always steam driven) climbed over the Mendip Hills and served many towns and villages on its run to Bournemouth; this example of an English rural line was closed by the Beeching cuts in March 1966, with few remaining signs of its existence, but its Bath station building survives and now houses a number of shops.

The 2004 Bristol/Bath to South Coast Study was commissioned as a result of the de-trunking in 1999 of the A36/A46 trunk road network from Bath to Southampton.

== Education ==
State-funded schools are organised within the district of Bath and North East Somerset. A review of Secondary Education in Bath was started in 2007, primarily to reduce surplus provision and reduce the number of single-sex secondary schools in Bath, and to access capital funds available through the government&#x27;s Building Schools for the Future programme.

The city contains one further education college, Bath College, and several sixth forms as part of both state, private, and public schools. In England, on average in 2006, 45.8% of pupils gained 5 grades A-C including English and Maths; for Bath and North East Somerset pupils taking GCSE at 16 it is 52.0%. Special needs education is provided by Three Ways School.

Bath has two universities. The University of Bath was established in 1966. It is known, academically, for the physical sciences, mathematics, architecture, management and technology.

Bath Spa University was first granted degree-awarding powers in 1992 as a university college (Bath Spa University College), before being granted university status in August 2005. It has schools in Art and Design, Education, English and Creative Studies, Historical and Cultural Studies, Music and the Performing Arts, and Social Sciences.
It also awards degrees through colleges such as Weston College in nearby Weston-super-Mare.

<text>Fuchsia ( ) is a genus of flowering plants that consists mostly of shrubs or small trees.

Almost 110 species of &quot;Fuchsia&quot; are recognized; the vast majority are native to South America, but a few occur north through Central America to Mexico, and also several from New Zealand to Tahiti. One species, &quot;F. magellanica&quot;, extends as far as the southern tip of South America, occurring on Tierra del Fuego in the cool temperate zone, but the majority are tropical or subtropical. 

== Taxonomy ==
The first to be scientifically described, &quot;Fuchsia triphylla&quot;, was discovered on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic) about 1696–1697 by the French Minim friar and botanist, Charles Plumier, during his third expedition to the Greater Antilles. He named the new genus after German botanist Leonhart Fuchs (1501–1566, ).

The fuchsias are most closely related to the northern hemisphere genus &quot;Circaea&quot;, the two lineages having diverged around 41 million years ago.

== Description ==

Most fuchsias are shrubs from tall, but one New Zealand species, the kōtukutuku (&quot;F. excorticata&quot;), is unusual in the genus in being a tree, growing up to tall. Fuchsia leaves are opposite or in whorls of three to five, simple lanceolate, and usually have serrated margins (entire in some species), 1–25 cm long, and can be either deciduous or evergreen, depending on the species.

The flowers are very decorative; they have a pendulous teardrop shape and are displayed in profusion throughout the summer and autumn, and all year in tropical species. They have four long, slender sepals and four shorter, broader petals; in many species, the sepals are bright red and the petals purple (colours that attract the hummingbirds that pollinate them), but the colours can vary from white to dark red, purple-blue, and orange. A few have yellowish tones. The ovary is inferior.

The fruit is a small (5–25 mm) dark reddish green, deep red, or deep purple berry, containing numerous very small seeds. The fruit of the berry of &quot;F. splendens&quot; is reportedly among the best-tasting. Its flavor is reminiscent of citrus and black pepper, and it can be made into jam. The fruits of some other fuchsias are flavorless or leave a bad aftertaste.

== Species ==

The majority of &quot;Fuchsia&quot; species are native to Central and South America. A small additional number are found on Hispaniola (two species), in New Zealand (three species) and on Tahiti (one species). Philip A. Munz in his &quot;A Revision of the Genus Fuchsia&quot; classified the genus into seven sections of 100 species. More recent scientific publications, especially those by the botanists Dennis E. Breedlove of the University of California and, currently, Paul E. Berry of the University of Michigan, recognize 108 species and 122 taxa, organized into 12 sections. In New Zealand and Tahiti, section &quot;Skinnera&quot; now consists of only three species as &quot;F.&quot; × &quot;colensoi&quot; has been determined to be a naturally occurring hybrid between &quot;F. excorticata&quot; and &quot;F. perscandens&quot;. Also, &quot;F. procumbens&quot; has been placed into its own section, &quot;Procumbentes.&quot; Two other new sections are &quot;Pachyrrhiza&quot; and &quot;Verrucosa&quot;, each with one species. The Plant List, a cooperative endeavor by several leading botanical institutions to maintain a working list of all plant species, lists most currently accepted &quot;Fuchsia&quot; species and synonyms.

The vast majority of garden hybrids have descended from a few parent species.

== Cultivation ==
Fuchsias are popular garden shrubs, and once planted can live for years with a minimal amount of care. The British Fuchsia Society maintains a list of hardy fuchsias that have been proven to survive a number of winters throughout Britain and to be back in flower each year by July. Enthusiasts report that hundreds and even thousands of hybrids survive and prosper throughout Britain. In the United States, the Northwest Fuchsia Society maintains an extensive list of fuchsias that have proven hardy in members&#x27; gardens in the Pacific Northwest over at least three winters.

Fuchsias from sections &quot;Quelusia&quot; (&quot;F. magellanica&quot;, &quot;F. regia&quot;), &quot;Encliandra&quot;, &quot;Skinnera&quot; (&quot;F. excorticata&quot;, &quot;F. perscandens&quot;) and &quot;Procumbentes&quot; (&quot;F. procumbens&quot;) have especially proven to be hardy in widespread areas of Britain and Ireland, as well as in many other countries such as New Zealand (aside from its native species) or the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. A number of species will easily survive outdoors in agreeable mild temperate areas. Though some may not always flower in the average British summer, they will often perform well in other favorable climatic zones. Even in somewhat colder regions, a number of the hardier species will often survive as herbaceous perennials, dying back and reshooting from below ground in the spring.

Due to the favorably mild, temperate climate created by the North Atlantic Current fuchsias grow abundantly in the West Kerry and West Cork region of Ireland and in the Isles of Scilly, even colonising wild areas there. While &quot;F. magellanica&quot; is not widespread in Scotland it has been known to grow wild in sheltered areas, such as the banks of local streams in Fife. In the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, &quot;F. magellanica&quot; also easily survives regional winters.

=== Categories ===
Horticultural fuchsias may be categorised as upright and bushy, or trailing. Some can be trained as hedges, such as &quot;F. magellanica&quot;. Faster-growing varieties are easiest to train. Care should be taken to choose the hardier cultivars for permanent plantings in the garden as many popular upright Fuchsias such as &#x27;Ernie&#x27;, &#x27;Jollies Nantes&#x27; and &#x27;Maria Landy&#x27; are not reliably winter hardy, but rather extremely tender (hardiness zone 10).

== Cultivars ==
In the UK, 60 cultivated varieties of fuchsia have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit, including:-
* &#x27;Alice Hoffman&#x27; (pink sepals, white petals – hardy)
* &#x27;Display&#x27; (deep pink/rose pink single)
* &#x27;Dollar Prinzessin&#x27; (cerise sepals, purple petals – hardy)
* &#x27;Garden News&#x27; (light pink sepals, double magenta petals – hardy)
* &#x27;Genii&#x27; (single, cerise/purple)
* &#x27;Hawkshead&#x27; (white self)
* &#x27;Lady Thumb&#x27; (compact, pink sepals, white petals)
* &#x27;Mrs Popple&#x27; (vigorous, red sepals, purple petals – hardy)

* &#x27;Thalia&#x27; (&quot;tryphilla&quot; group, orange)
* &#x27;Tom Thumb&#x27; (compact, pink sepals, mauve petals)

== Pests and diseases ==


Fuchsias are eaten by the caterpillars of some Lepidoptera, such as the elephant hawk-moth (&quot;Deilephila elpenor&quot;) and the black-lyre leafroller moth (&quot;&quot;Cnephasia&quot; jactatana&quot;). Other major insect pests include aphids, mirid bugs such as &quot;Lygocoris&quot;, &quot;Lygus&quot; and &quot;Plesiocoris&quot; spp., vine weevils (&quot;Otiorhynchus&quot; spp.), and greenhouse whitefly (&quot;Trialeurodes vaporariorum&quot;). Problematic mites include the fuchsia gall mite (&quot;Aculops fuchsiae&quot;) and red spider mite (&quot;Tetranychus urticae&quot;).

== Pronunciation and spelling ==
While the original pronunciation from the word&#x27;s German origin is , the standard pronunciation for the common name in English is . As a consequence, &quot;fuchsia&quot; is often misspelled as &quot;&quot; in English.

When pronounced as scientific Latin name, the pronunciation would be , if one applies the rule that the root word in honorific Latin names should follow as much as possible the original pronunciation of the name of the person the plant is named for, plus the standard pronunciation of the Latin suffix. In practice, however, English-speaking botanists often pronounce it the same as the common name.

== History ==

Leonhart Fuchs, the eminent namesake of the genus, was born in 1501 in Wemding in the Duchy of Bavaria. A physician and professor, he occupied the chair of Medicine at the University of Tübingen from his appointment at the age of 34 until his death in 1566. Besides his medical knowledge, according to his record of activities which was extensive for the time, he studied plants. This was usual for the period. Most remedies and medicines were herbal and the two subjects were often inseparable. In the course of his career Fuchs wrote the seminal &quot;De Historia Stirpium Commentarii Insignes&quot;, which was richly illustrated and published in 1542. Along with Otto Brunfels (1489–1534) and Hieronymus Bock (1498–1554), also called Hieronymus Tragus, he is today considered one of the three fathers of botany.

It was in honour of Fuchs&#x27; and his work that the fuchsia received its name shortly before 1703 by Charles Plumier. Plumier compiled his &quot;Nova Plantarum Americanum&quot;, which was published in Paris in 1703, based on the results of his third plant-finding trip to the Caribbean in search of new genera. In it he described &quot;Fuchsia triphylla flore coccinea...&quot;. Plumier&#x27;s novel species was accepted by Linnaeus in 1753 but the long descriptive name was shortened in accordance with his binomial system.

The first fuchsia species were introduced into English gardens and glasshouses at the end of the 18th century. &quot;Fuchsia coccinea&quot; Aiton arrived at Kew Gardens in 1788 to be formally described in 1789. It was apparently shortly followed by &quot;Fuchsia magellanica&quot; Lam. There is much early confusion between these two similar-looking species in the Quelusia Section and they seem to have hybridized readily as well. &quot;Fuchsia magellanica&quot;, however, proved very hardy outdoors and its cultivars soon naturalized in favorable areas of the British Isles. Other species were quickly introduced to greenhouses. Of special interest is the introduction of &quot;Fuchsia fulgens&quot; Moç. &amp; Sessé ex DC in the 1830s as it resulted in an outpouring of new cultivars when crossed with the existing species.

Philip Munz, in his &quot;A Revision of the Genus Fuchsia&quot; (1943), repeats the story that the fuchsia was first introduced into England by a sailor who grew it in a window where it was observed by a nurseryman from Hammersmith, a Mr. Lee, who succeeded in buying it and propagating it for the trade. This was supposedly either one of the short-tubed species such as &quot;Fuchsia magellanica&quot; or &quot;Fuchsia coccinea&quot;. The story given by Munz first appears in the 1850s and is embellished in various early publications. Captain Firth, a sailor, brought the plant back to England from one of his trips to his home in Hammersmith where he gave it to his wife. Later James Lee of St. Johns Wood, nurseryman and an astute businessman, heard of the plant and purchased it for £80. He then propagated as many as possible and sold them to the trade for prices ranging from £10 to £20 each. In the &quot;Floricultural Cabinet&quot;, 1855, there is a report which varies slightly from the above. There it is stated that &quot;F. coccinea&quot; was given to Kew Garden in 1788 by Captain Firth and that Lee acquired it from Kew. Other than a citation at Kew itself that &quot;Fuchsia coccinea&quot; was indeed given to it by a Captain Firth, there is no firm evidence to support any of these introduction stories.

Throughout the nineteenth century, plant-collecting fever spread throughout Europe and the United States. Many species of numerous genera were introduced, some as living plants, others as seed. The following fuchsias were recorded in England at Kew: &quot;F. lycioides&quot;, 1796; &quot;F. arborescens&quot;, 1824; &quot;F. microphylla&quot;, 1827; &quot;F. fulgens&quot;, 1830; &quot;F. corymbiflora&quot;, 1840; and &quot;F. apetala&quot;, &quot;F. decussata&quot;, &quot;F. dependens&quot; and &quot;F. serratifolia&quot; in 1843 and 1844, the last four species attributable to Messrs. Veitch of Exeter.

With the increasing numbers of differing species in England plant breeders began to immediately develop hybrids to develop more desirable garden plants. The first recorded experiments date to 1825 as &quot;F. arborescens&quot; Χ &quot;F. macrostemma&quot; and &quot;F. arborescens&quot; X &quot;F. coccinea&quot; where the quality of the resultant plants was unrecorded.

Between 1835 and 1850 there was a tremendous influx to England of both hybrids and varieties, the majority of which have been lost.

In 1848 Felix Porcher published the second edition of his book &quot;Le Fuchsia son Histoire et sa Culture&quot;. This described 520 cultivars. In 1871 in later editions of M. Porchers book reference is made to James Lye who was to become famous as a breeder of fuchsias in England. In 1883 the first book of English fuchsias was published.

Between 1900 and 1914 many of the famous cultivated varieties were produced which were grown extensively for Covent Garden market by many growers just outside London. During the period between the world wars, fuchsia-growing slowed as efforts were made toward crop production until after 1949, when plant and hybrid production resumed on a large scale.

In the United States, Sidney Mitchell, a member of the newly formed American Fuchsia Society in San Francisco (1929), shipped a large collection of fuchsias back to California from a nine-month trip to visit gardens in Europe in 1930. Almost immediately after the Society had been established in 1929, a thorough census and collection of fuchsias already growing in California gardens and nurseries had been undertaken under the scientific leadership and direction of Alice Eastwood. The census yielded ninety-one existing cultivars. Armed with that list, Mitchell acquired 51 new fuchsias; 48 of his plants survived the long trip. These were doled out to members of the society and local businesses. Half were also cultivated at the University of California Botanical Garden in Berkeley and the other half at the Berkeley Horticultural Nursery. A wave of interest in fuchsia breeding was launched. Together with the hybrids already in California, many famous American hybrids of the 1940s and 1950s are the descendants of this 1930 group.

<doc id="268224" wikidata="Q166817" url="?curid=268224" title="Caltrain">
<text>Caltrain (reporting mark JPBX) is a commuter rail line in California, serving the San Francisco Peninsula and Santa Clara Valley (Silicon Valley). The southern terminus is in San Jose at the Tamien station with weekday rush hour service running as far as Gilroy. The northern terminus of the line is in San Francisco at 4th and King Street. Caltrain has express, limited, and local services. There are 28 regular stops, one limited-service weekday-only stop (College Park), one weekend and holiday-only stop (Broadway), and one stop that is only served on football game days (Stanford). While average weekday ridership in 2019 exceeded 63,000, impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have been significant: in June 2024, Caltrain had an average weekday ridership of 24,580 passengers.

Caltrain is governed by the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board (PCJPB) which consists of agencies from the three counties served by Caltrain: Santa Clara, San Francisco, and San Mateo. Each member agency has three representatives on a nine-member Board of Directors. The member agencies are the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, and the San Mateo County Transit District (SamTrans).

Historically served by diesel locomotives, Caltrain has electrified of its route between 4th and King and Tamien and has transitioned to electric service, with diesel trains remaining in service between San Jose and Gilroy.

==History==
===Southern Pacific service===
The original commuter railroad was built in 1863 under the authority of the San Francisco &amp; San Jose Railroad; it was purchased by Southern Pacific (SP) in 1870.

SP double-tracked the line in 1904 and rerouted it via the Bayshore Cutoff. After 1945, ridership declined with the rise in automobile use; in 1977 SP petitioned the state Public Utilities Commission to discontinue the commuter operation because of ongoing losses. California legislators wrote Assembly Bill 1853 in 1977 to allow local transit districts along the line to make bulk purchases of tickets for resale at a loss, subsidizing commuters reliant on the Peninsula Commute until 1980; more importantly, the bill also authorized the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to begin negotiating with SP to operate the passenger rail service and acquire the right-of-way between San Bruno and Daly City.

To preserve the commuter service, in 1980 Caltrans contracted with SP and began to subsidize the Peninsula Commute. Caltrans purchased new locomotives and rolling stock, replacing SP equipment in 1985. Caltrans also upgraded stations, added shuttle buses to nearby employers, and dubbed the operation CalTrain.

===Joint Powers Board===

The Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board was formed in 1987 to manage the line. Subsequently, San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties commissioned Earth Metrics, Inc., to prepare an Environmental Impact Report on right-of-way acquisition and expansion of operations. With state and local funding, the PCJPB bought the railroad right of way between San Francisco and San Jose from SP in 1991. As SamTrans advanced most of the local fund used to purchased the right-of-way, it was also agreed that SamTrans would serve as the managing agency until San Francisco and Santa Clara Counties could repay their portions. The following year, PCJPB took responsibility for CalTrain operations and selected Amtrak as the contract operator. PCJPB extended the CalTrain service from San Jose to Gilroy, connecting to VTA light rail at Tamien station in San Jose.

In July 1995, CalTrain became accessible to passengers with wheelchairs. Five months later, CalTrain increased the bicycle limit to 24 per train, making the service attractive to commuters in bicycle-friendly cities such as San Francisco and Palo Alto.

In July 1997, the current logo was adopted, and the official name became Caltrain, dropping the capitalized “T”.

In 1998, the San Francisco Municipal Railway extended the N Judah line from Market Street to the San Francisco Caltrain Station at 4th and King streets, providing a direct connection between Caltrain and the Muni Metro system. A year later, VTA extended its light rail service from north Santa Clara to the Mountain View station. Starting in 1999, Caltrain reconstructed several stations and upgraded tracks and level crossings under the &quot;Ponderosa Project&quot;.

In June 2003, a passenger connection for the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and Caltrain systems opened at Millbrae station just south of the San Francisco International Airport.

In 2008, Caltrain reached an all-time high of 98 trains each weekday.

Caltrain announced on August 19, 2011, a staff recommendation to sign a five-year, $62.5 million contract with TransitAmerica Services, after taking proposals from three other firms, including Amtrak California, which had provided operating employees since 1992. The new operating contract was approved by the full Joint Powers Board at its scheduled September 1 meeting. TransitAmerica Services took over not only the conductor and engineer jobs on the trains, but also dispatching and maintenance of equipment, track, and right-of-way from Amtrak. On May 26, 2012, TransitAmerica took over full operations.

===Baby Bullet service===
In June 2004, Caltrain finished its two-year CTX (Caltrain Express) project for a new express service called the Baby Bullet. The project entailed new bypass tracks in Brisbane and Sunnyvale as well as a new centralized traffic control system. The Baby Bullet trains reduced travel time by stopping at only four or five stations between San Francisco and San Jose Diridon station; the express trains could overtake local trains at the two locations (near Bayshore and Lawrence stations) where passing loops were added. Travel time for about 46.75 miles between San Francisco and San Jose is 57 minutes (four stops), 59 minutes (five stops) or 61 minutes (six stops), compared to 1 hour 30 minutes for local trains. The Baby Bullets have the same top speed of as other trains, but fewer stops save time. The CTX project included the purchase of new Bombardier BiLevel Coaches along with MPI MP36PH-3C locomotives. The Baby Bullets proved popular, but many riders had longer commutes on non-bullet trains, some of which would wait for Baby Bullet trains to pass.

===Budget crises===
In May 2005 Caltrain started a series of fare increases and schedule changes in response to a projected budget shortfall. The frequency of the popular Baby Bullet express trains was increased; two express trains were added in May and another ten were added in August. New Baby Bullet stops, Pattern B stops, were introduced. Another increase of $0.25 in basic fare came in January 2006.

On April 2, 2010, Caltrain announced the need to cut its services by around 50%, as it was required to cut $30 million from its $97 million budget because all three authorities that fund the line were facing financial problems themselves and $10 million a year in previous state funding had been cut. Revenues for both local and state agencies had been steadily declining, as well as ticket revenues at Caltrain itself, and had left all &quot;beyond broke.&quot;

On January 1, 2011, Caltrain cut four midday trains but upgraded four weekend trains to Baby Bullet service as a pilot program. This reduced its schedule from 90 to 86 trains each weekday. At the same time, it raised fares $0.25 and continued to contemplate cutting weekday service to 48 trains during commute hours only. By April 2011, Caltrain&#x27;s board had approved a budget with fare increases to take effect on July 1, 2011, and no service cuts. The budget gap would be closed with another $0.25 fare increase, a $1 parking fee increase to $4, and additional money from other transit agencies and the MTC.

On February 17, 2017, California State Senator Jerry Hill introduced SB 797, which would permit the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board to submit a regional measure for sales tax increase of th of one cent to the voters in the three counties served by Caltrain. The regional measure would require a two-thirds majority (aggregated among the three counties) to pass, and would provide Caltrain with a dedicated revenue source estimated at $100 million per year. For comparison, in fiscal year 2016 (ending June 30, 2016), the operating expenses for Caltrain were $118 million, and farebox revenues were $87 million, leaving approximately $31 million in expenses to be funded by the PCJPB through its member agencies and county government contributions. SB 797 passed the California State Senate in May, and the State Assembly in September, and Governor Brown signed the bill into law in October.
Advocates for the increased tax cited its potential benefits to alleviate congestion along U.S. Route 101, which Carl Guardino quipped &quot;has become so congested that we&#x27;ve changed its name to the &#x27;101 Parking Lot&#x27;.&quot; Detractors pointed to Caltrain&#x27;s bureaucracy and stated fares should be increased to improve services instead. A poll of 1,200 voters in early May indicated support was strong enough to pass the sales tax increase, if the tax would result in expanding ridership capacity. The poll was sponsored by the Silicon Valley Leadership Group (SVLG), headed by Guardino, which predicted that daily ridership could rise to 250,000 with the improvements in service funded by the dedicated sales tax increase. Potential capital projects which could use the dedicated funding include additional electric multiple units (making electric trains 8-EMU consists, rather than 6-EMU), extended boarding platforms, and the proposed Downtown Rail Extension (now known as The Portal) to the Salesforce Transit Center. A dedicated tax was proposed in 2011, contemporaneously with the prior budget crisis, but polls at the time indicated insufficient support. After SVLG&#x27;s May 2017 poll indicated strong support, they petitioned Hill to act.

By early 2020, the joint powers board was planning to propose a one-eighth-cent sales tax for voter approval later in the year, to provide an estimated $ of dedicated funding for the system, which currently relies on rider fares for 70% of its revenue. This funding would have enabled Caltrain to run 168 trains per weekday, with rush-hour headways of 10 minutes, with the completion of electrification in 2022. BART-like service levels were projected to increase ridership significantly.

In March 2020, Caltrain&#x27;s ridership dropped by 95% due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in losses of $ per month. The joint powers board recast the sales tax proposal as a way to keep the system afloat. Due to the COVID-19 measures and subsequent loss of approximately 75% of its ridership, Caltrain discontinued Baby Bullet service starting March 17, 2020. Two weeks later, due to continued loss of ridership, Caltrain further cut service from 92 to 42 trains per weekday, starting March 30. Average weekday ridership plummeted from approximately 65,000 (pre-pandemic) to 1,300. By June 15, service was increased to 70 trains per weekday, and limited (skip-stop) service was reinstated; later that month, ridership had recovered to 3,200 per weekday. In July, after the San Francisco Board of Supervisors initially declined to consider the ballot proposal, citing concerns about the system&#x27;s governance structure, Caltrain officials warned that the agency would run out of operating funds and be forced to suspend service by the end of the year. In August, San Mateo County officials agreed to make Caltrain more independent from SamTrans in exchange for placing the sales tax on the ballot. In November 2020, Measure RR passed which created dedicated funding of a one-eighth cent sales tax. The schedule was adjusted again starting December 14, with slightly fewer weekday trains (68) but more frequent off-peak and weekend service to support essential workers.

The number of weekday trains returned to 70 starting March 22, 2021, and the schedule was adjusted to facilitate transfers to BART at Millbrae. Caltrain began operation with a new schedule that exceeds pre-pandemic service on August 30, 2021; there are 104 trains operated per weekday, including reinstated Baby Bullet service. Headways for popular stations are as low as 15 minutes during peak commute hours (6–9 a.m. and 4–7 p.m.) and 30 minutes throughout the day before 11 p.m. for most stations. The separate Saturday and Sunday schedules were consolidated into a single weekend schedule with 32 trains per weekend day. All stations have a maximum headway of 60 minutes, including weekends, except for a 90-120 minute gap between the earliest weekend trains. In addition, fares were cut in half for September.

Gilroy service was increased to four weekday round trips on September 25, 2023.

===Modernization and electrification===

The Caltrain Modernization Program electrified the main line between San Francisco and the San Jose Tamien station, allowing transition from diesel-electric locomotive power to electric rolling stock. Proponents said electrification would improve service times via faster acceleration, allow better scheduling and reduce air pollution and noise. Electrification would also allow future expansion to downtown San Francisco. Electrified vehicles require less maintenance, but electrification will increase required track maintenance by about the same dollar amount, at least initially. The plan called to electrify the system between San Francisco 4th and King Street station and San Jose Tamien station. Originally scheduled for completion by 2020, the first electric multiple unit services started on August 11, 2024, with full electrification achieved and diesel trains retired on September 21, 2024.

The electrification project between San Francisco and Tamien is the first phase, the second phase being from Tamien station to Gilroy. Cost, excluding electric rolling stock, for the first phase was estimated at $471 million (2006 dollars). By 2016, costs had increased to $1.7 billion. Notably, in 2021, Caltrain stated that the overall cost of electrification had risen to $2.44 billion. As part of the Caltrain Modernization Program and mandated by the federal government, positive train control (PTC) was installed along the route between San Francisco and San Jose by late 2015.

Caltrain planned to use lighter electric multiple units that do not comply with the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) crashworthiness standards, but instead comply with the International Union of Railways (UIC) standards, on the electrified lines. The FRA granted Caltrain a waiver to operate these units, which were previously banned on mixed-use lines with other FRA-compliant rolling stock due to concerns over crashworthiness, after Caltrain submitted simulation data showing UIC-compliant rolling stock performed no worse or even better than FRA-compliant rolling stock in crashes. Caltrain plans to retain its newer diesel-electric rolling stock for use on the Dumbarton Extension and service south of Tamien.
Caltrain awarded the electrification and EMU contracts at the July 7, 2016, PCJPB board meeting to Balfour Beatty and Stadler Rail, respectively, signaling the start of modernization efforts that will make Caltrain more akin to rapid-transit services such as Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) than traditional commuter services, and allow the future California High-Speed Rail trains to reach San Francisco utilizing Caltrain tracks. In August 2016, Caltrain ordered sixteen six-car double-decker Stadler KISS electric multiple unit sets from Stadler Rail. The price is $166m for the 16 units, or $551m including an option of 96 more EMU cars.

However, the plans for an electrified Caltrain were put in jeopardy in February 2017 by the Trump administration when US Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao decided to indefinitely delay granting the federal funding for the Caltrain electrification project that had been approved by the Obama administration. One month later, in March 2017, the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) sent a letter to Secretary Chao calling the Caltrain delay &quot;concerning.&quot; In more than two decades, the APTA wrote, &quot;no project has failed to secure final signature after successfully meeting evaluation criteria.&quot; In February 2017, Caltrain fired Parsons Transportation Group and sued them for delays in designing the custom technologies necessary for the PTC system. They then went on to sign a contract with Wabtec, who would offer them the industry-standard PTC system.
On April 30, legislators in the United States Congress included $100 million for the Caltrain electrification project in the proposed 2017 federal spending bill, which was signed into law by President Trump on May 6. The $100 million represents the federal funding for fiscal year 2017 of the total $647 million grant, with the balance expected in future years. Secretary Chao claimed she could not sign the grant without the full grant being budgeted, which was disputed by Caltrain and both California Senators Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris. On May 22, the FTA announced its intent to sign the funding grant, restoring the final piece of funding for the electrification project. The official grant was finally signed on May 23, and Caltrain broke ground for the Peninsula Corridor Electrification Project on July 21, 2017, in a ceremony attended by local and state officials at the Millbrae station.

In December 2018, it was reported that Caltrain was again behind schedule in installing PTC for the rail corridor, and had requested a two-year extension. The Federal Railroad Administration certified Caltrain&#x27;s PTC project in December 2020. The first electric trainset was shipped to the Transportation Technology Center for testing in February 2021. In June 2021, Caltrain announced the start of revenue service with electric multiple units would be delayed to late 2024.

In February 2022, the last foundation required for the new overhead catenary system was completed, with the entire line planned to be energized by summer 2022. Testing of the line would then begin using a AEM-7 electric locomotive, with revenue service planned for 2024. On March 10, 2022, a southbound train struck a contractor&#x27;s crane in San Bruno, injuring 13 people.

Caltrain began public operation of its electrified trainsets on August 11, 2024, with two trainsets, adding more each week until the full rollout of electric service between San Francisco and Tamien on September 21. As part of the transition, a new schedule was implemented. The new schedule provides for 104 trains on weekdays (52 in each direction) between San Francisco and San Jose Diridon, with local service running every 30 minutes, and alternating trains continuing to Tamien. During weekday rush hours, local service is supplemented by express (stopping only at 22nd Street, South San Francisco, Millbrae, San Mateo, Hillsdale, Redwood City, Palo Alto, Mountain View and Sunnyvale) and limited-stop trains (running express between San Francisco and Redwood City, then local between Redwood City and San Jose). Diesel trains continue to be used for South County Connector service between San Jose and Gilroy, with 4 trains in each direction, with these trains scheduled to provide timed cross-platform transfers to and from limited-stop or express electric trains at Diridon. Weekend service was doubled to 66 trains (33 in each direction), with local service running every 30 minutes between San Francisco and San Jose Diridon, and alternating trains continuing to Tamien.

===Grade separation===

, there were 41 vehicular at-grade crossings remaining along the PCJPB-owned right-of-way from San Francisco to Tamien:
* 2 in San Francisco: Mission Bay Dr, 16th St
* 29 in San Mateo County
** South San Francisco: Linden Ave
** San Bruno: Scott St
** Millbrae: Center St
** Burlingame: Broadway, Oak Grove, North Lane, Howard Ave, Bayswater, Peninsula
** San Mateo: Peninsula, Villa Terrace, Bellevue, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 9th
** Redwood City: Whipple, Brewster, Broadway, Maple, Main, Chestnut

** Atherton: Fair Oaks Ln, Watkins
** Menlo Park: Encinal, Glenwood, Oak Grove, Ravenswood
* 10 in Santa Clara County
** Palo Alto: Palo Alto, Churchill, Meadow, Charleston
** Mountain View: Rengstorff Ave, Castro St
** Sunnyvale: Mary, Sunnyvale
** San Jose: Auzerais, West Virginia

In addition, there are 28 more at-grade crossings in Santa Clara County along the UP-owned right-of-way between Tamien and Gilroy, including crossings at Skyway Drive, Branham Lane, Chynoweth Avenue in south San Jose.
The first grade separation project under PCJPB was completed in 1994, building a flyover for Oyster Point Boulevard in South San Francisco. Additional grade separations were completed in 1995 (Fifth Ave in North Fair Oaks, depressed under rails), 1996 (Millbrae Ave in Millbrae, elevated above rails), and 1999 (Jefferson Ave in Redwood City, depressed under rails). Grade separation projects near the Belmont and San Carlos stations (for Ralston, Harbor, Holly, Brittan, and Howard) were completed in 1995, and 2000; these were &quot;hybrid&quot; crossings, executed as a combination of road depression and rails elevated on berms. The San Bruno station reconstruction was completed in 2014, separating the crossings at San Bruno, San Mateo, and Angus by elevating the rails on a long, curved berm. In 2021, a similar hybrid grade separation project (25th, 28th, and 31st Avenues in San Mateo) was completed near the Hillsdale station, which was relocated north during the grade separation.

In 2018, gates were down for an average of approximately 11 minutes at each crossing during a typical peak weekday commute hour. The anticipated increase in rail traffic resulting from the completion of PCEP and implementation of CAHSR will result in additional road traffic delays for the remaining at-grade crossings along the Peninsula Corridor.

== Proposed plans ==

=== Integration with California High-Speed Rail ===

The Caltrain line from Gilroy to San Francisco is part of the planned route of the California High-Speed Rail line. With the adaptation of the preferred alternative in July 2019 on the San Jose to Gilroy HSR section, dedicated HSR tracks are planned south and east of Gilroy station, while CAHSR trains would use a &quot;blended&quot; service, sharing tracks with Caltrain between San Francisco and Gilroy. Blended service CAHSR trains would travel at speeds up to between Gilroy and San Francisco, and higher HSR speeds up to south and east of Gilroy.

=== Downtown San Francisco extension ===

A tunnel has been proposed to extend Caltrain from its north end in San Francisco at 4th and King to the newly built Salesforce Transit Center, closer to the job center of San Francisco and BART, Muni, Transbay AC Transit buses, and long-distance buses. , only the structural &quot;train box&quot; below the Transbay Terminal had been funded and was being built. In April 2012, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission decided to make the remainder of the $2.5 billion extension its top priority for federal funding. The extension would also serve the California High-Speed Rail system.

An alternative proposal, by then-Mayor Ed Lee, would see the existing terminal and trains yards demolished, along with Interstate 280 in Mission Bay, and replaced with infill housing. Caltrain and high-speed rail would be extended to the Transbay Terminal in a new tunnel under Third Street.

In April 2018, the alternative alignment through Mission Bay was rejected in favor of a revised alignment under Pennsylvania Avenue. The new alignment would ultimately join the original alignment near 4th and King Station while tunneling under Pennsylvania Avenue from near 25th Street. As of 2023, the revised extension is projected to cost $6.7 billion and could open for service as soon as 2032.

=== Dumbarton extension ===

Caltrain has been chosen to provide commuter rail service on a to-be-rebuilt Dumbarton Rail Corridor across the San Francisco Bay between the Peninsula and Alameda County in the East Bay. This project would add four stations to the Caltrain system: Union City, Fremont-Centerville, Newark, and Menlo Park/East Palo Alto. The two obsolete swing bridges along the corridor would be replaced. Dumbarton Rail was scheduled to start construction in 2009 after a 30-month environmental review and begin service in 2012. SamTrans, one of Caltrain&#x27;s member agencies, already owns the right-of-way for the Dumbarton Rail Bridge. The bridge has not been used since 1982, when it was still owned by Southern Pacific, and about 33% of the bridge collapsed due to an arson fire in 1998. However, the project&#x27;s estimated cost doubled between 2004 and 2006, to US$600 million, and is financially problematic. In January 2009, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission instead applied the funds to the BART Warm Springs Extension project in Fremont, delaying the Dumbarton rail project for at least a decade.

=== South of Gilroy extension ===
Potential restoration of &quot;Del Monte&quot;-like service to had been identified as early as the Caltrans 1984-89 Rail passenger development plan. Amtrak declined to operate such service, but operations under Southern Pacific (by then running state-subsidized services) were studied with ridership forecast developed. Extensions to Hollister have been proposed since at least 2003.

Caltrain was approached by the Transportation Agency for Monterey County (TAMC) to extend service south of Gilroy into Monterey County. A draft environmental impact report stated the lack of public transportation between Monterey County and the Bay Area has resulted in increased private commuter vehicle traffic. Traffic on U.S. Route 101 was projected to rise by up to 56% in 2020 compared to 1998 levels, resulting in unstable traffic flow from the Salinas city limits to the Santa Clara County line as a result.

The concept of a Caltrain extension to Monterey County has been considered since at least 1996, with the cities of Salinas and Watsonville considering rail station improvements and construction between 1996 and 1998, culminating in a TAMC-sponsored &quot;Extension of Caltrain Commuter Service to Monterey County Business Plan&quot; in 2000. The proposed extension would create new stations and stops in Pajaro (serving Watsonville in adjacent Santa Cruz County at an estimated cost of ) and Castroville (at an estimated cost of ) before terminating at the existing Salinas Amtrak station with &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; service. The Salinas station would be rebuilt as an intermodal station to connect commuter rail with Monterey-Salinas Transit buses. A layover yard would be added to accommodate Caltrain crews and maintenance, and the total cost of the Salinas improvements was estimated at . The cost of operating commuter rail from the anticipated start of service until 2030 was estimated at for two daily round trips, including an expansion to four round trips daily within ten years.

This project depends on state and federal funding availability, a possible local sales tax measure, and an agreement with Union Pacific, the owner of the Salinas-to-Gilroy tracks and right-of-way. This project is managed by TAMC, who released the Final Environment Impact Report (EIR) for this project in 2006. This would complement another plan to re-establish rail service last provided by Southern Pacific&#x27;s &quot;Del Monte Express&quot; which operated between Monterey and San Francisco.

In 2009, Caltrain requested that TAMC approach other train operators. TAMC subsequently opened discussions with the Capitol Corridor Joint Powers Authority and the Caltrans Division of Rail to extend &quot;Capitol Corridor&quot; service south from San Jose to Salinas using the same routing and stations. The switch to Capitol Corridor was cited as an advantage, since CCJPA had experience with commuter trains sharing service on Union Pacific-owned freight right-of-way. Two Capitol Corridor trains would originate from Salinas in the mornings and run through to San Jose and on to Sacramento, with two evening trains making the return trip south to Salinas.

By 2016, plans had shifted in favor of Amtrak California&#x27;s &quot;Capitol Corridor&quot; to be the service extended to Salinas station. However, with the awarding of Road Repair and Accountability Act funds in 2018, it was revealed that Caltrain again would operate to Salinas as the first commuter rail service with Capitol Corridor service to follow later. , two daily Caltrain round trips were planned to begin in 2022 after the completion of the Salinas layover facility and trackwork at Gilroy. Future phases are proposed to add stations at Pajaro/Watsonville and Castroville, with the potential for up to six daily round trips.

=== Oakdale infill station ===
A study from 1988 evaluated replacing the Paul Avenue station with a new station to the north, at either Williams, Palou, or Evans, as part of the effort to relocate the home port for to the Hunters Point Shipyard, and concluded that with the completion of the Downtown Rail Extension (now known as The Portal), daily ridership could increase to 2,400. However, without the Downtown Extension, ridership would be limited to less than 100. The 1988 study concluded the preferred site was at Evans Avenue.

The &quot;Bayview Hunters Point Community Revitalization Concept Plan&quot; (March 2002) identified the Oakdale-Palou area as the community&#x27;s preferred location for the Caltrain station. With the completion of the Caltrain Express project, service to Paul Avenue was reduced and the station was closed in 2005. A feasibility study that year proposed a replacement station just north of Oakdale Avenue, next to the City College of San Francisco Southeast Campus in Bayview, north of the former Paul Avenue station, connecting with multiple bus lines. The station would be near the Quint Street Lead, which is used by freight trains moving east to the Intermodal Freight Rail Cargo Transfer Facility near Piers 90–96. A follow-up study in 2014 predicted daily ridership of around 2,350.

The Southeast Rail Station Study (SERSS) was released in June 2022 and was endorsed by the San Francisco Planning Commission on July 14. SERSS recommended a new Bayview Station should be located between Oakdale and Jerrold, over alternatives at Evans or at Williams.

Near the proposed station, the Caltrain line is grade-separated from Oakdale (which passes over the rail line) and Quint. Prior to 2016, the rail line was carried over Quint on a steel bridge originally constructed for the Bayshore Cutoff in the early 1900s. In preparation for a new Oakdale station, the bridge over Quint was removed on April 30 and replaced by a berm completed in July 2016, which severed Quint between Oakdale and Jerrold. A new road has been proposed to reconnect Quint to Jerrold on land belonging to Union Pacific, west of the tracks.

== Infrastructure and service ==

=== Right of way ===
The Caltrain right of way between San Francisco and Tamien stations is owned and maintained by its operating agency, the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board (PCJPB). PCJPB purchased the right of way from Southern Pacific (SP) in 1991, while SP maintained rights to inter-city passenger and freight trains. In exchange SP granted PCJPB rights to operate up to 6 trains per day between Tamien and Gilroy stations, later increased to 10 trains per day on a deal with SP&#x27;s successor Union Pacific (UP) in 2005. Three round-trip freight trains operate daily over the line.

Law enforcement services are provided by a division of the San Mateo County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, under contract with PCJPB.

=== Stations ===
The system has 31 stations. 28 stations are served daily, one (Broadway) is served on weekends only, one (College Park) is served during Bellarmine College Preparatory&#x27;s commute times on weekdays only, and one (Stanford) is served on Stanford University&#x27;s football game days only. San Francisco 4th and King Street is the northern terminus of the system, while Gilroy is the southern terminus. However, most trains originate and terminate at Tamien. The five southernmost stations—Capitol, Blossom Hill, Morgan Hill, San Martin, and Gilroy—are served only on weekdays during commute times in the peak direction, going toward San Francisco in the morning and toward Gilroy in the afternoon. Twelve stations were served by the express train service known as Baby Bullet, inaugurated in 2004 and discontinued in 2024. Santa Clara station is not long enough to accommodate six-car trains without minor service impacts. Seven stations (Millbrae, Burlingame, San Carlos, Menlo Park, Palo Alto, Santa Clara and San Jose Diridon) are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Southern Pacific Railroad originally built many stations with a side platform on the west side of the tracks to serve southbound trains, plus a narrow island platform between tracks to serve northbound trains. To protect northbound passengers from being struck by southbound trains, Caltrain implemented a &quot;hold-out rule&quot; (GCOR 6.30): if a train is stopped for passengers, an approaching train on another track must wait outside the station. This rule caused numerous delays, especially after the Caltrain Express project added Baby Bullet trains that pass through many stations without stopping. Most stations have been rebuilt (often as part of larger projects) with side platforms or wider island platforms, thus avoiding the hold-out rule. They have included in 1995; in the late 1990s; , , and in 2000; in 2002; in 2003; in 2005; and in 2008, in 2012, and in 2021. Weekday service at and was eliminated in 2005 due to the hold-out rule, while has only limited service. Atherton station was closed altogether in December 2020.

=== Services ===
The current services became effective on September 21, 2024:

=== Maintenance and operations facility ===
The Centralized Equipment Maintenance and Operations Facility is the train maintenance yard and facility serving Caltrain, north of San Jose Diridon station in San Jose. The maintenance station began construction in 2004 and opened on September 29, 2007. It consolidates much of Caltrain&#x27;s maintenance and operations into one location.
== Operations ==

The Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board purchased the right of way between San Francisco and San Jose for $212million from Southern Pacific in 1991 (equivalent to $ in ). Trackage rights with Union Pacific limit service south of Tamien to up to five round trips per weekday (four daily round trips operate ).

=== Operating expenses and farebox recovery ===
The operating expenses for fiscal year 2021 were $170,847,000. The fare revenue was $32,440,000, making the farebox recovery ratio 19.1%. Operating expenses for fiscal year 2022 rose to $174,388,000 while fare revenue rose to $33,236,000, marking a modest gain in the farebox recovery ratio to 21%, still less than a third of pre-pandemic levels.

=== Ridership ===
Caltrain ridership more than doubled between 2005 and 2015. Ridership growth has been linked to the expansion of businesses near Caltrain stations, a shift in attitudes against the use of cars for commuting, and the expansion Caltrain service which has included extra trains and the introduction of fast express services (&quot;Baby Bullet&quot; service).

=== Performance ===
According to the &quot;Rail and the California Economy&quot; study published in 2017, Caltrain Baby Bullet trains operate with a 95% on-time performance, defined as making stops within ten minutes of published schedules. In addition, Caltrain carries over 4,500 people per hour in each direction, equivalent to two freeway lanes in each direction. At current ridership levels, Caltrain directly removes of carbon dioxide emissions per day, displacing the equivalent of 10,000 vehicles per day, not counting any ancillary benefit from improved traffic flow resulting from reduced congestion.

== Ticketing ==
Caltrain operates as a proof-of-payment system. Each rider must buy a ticket prior to boarding the train that may or may not be checked during the trip. Tickets can be purchased at ticket vending machines located at all stations, as well as on the Caltrain app. Ticket windows located at San Jose Diridon and Fourth and King were closed in 2005.

One-way tickets expire four hours after purchase, but round-trip tickets (&quot;day passes&quot;) are good for unlimited rides within their zone limit until the last train of the day. A joint adult Caltrain/VTA Day Pass, valid through Zone 3 and intended for service to Levi&#x27;s Stadium, costs an additional $6 and covers fares on VTA buses and light rail, with the exception of VTA Express service. A Zone Upgrade may be purchased to augment a valid one-way ticket, day pass, or monthly pass at $2 per zone, valid for four hours after purchase and in one direction only. Discounted 8-ride tickets and monthly passes are available only with a Clipper card. Caltrain eliminated sales of the 8-ride ticket as of October 1, 2017; existing 8-ride tickets would be honored through the end of October. Seniors (aged 65 years and older), children (aged 17 years or younger), disabled, and Medicare card holders are eligible for a discounted fare at approximately half price (varies depending on the ticket).

=== Zone fare structure ===
Caltrain stations are split into six zones. Zone 1 comprises all stations in San Francisco, plus South San Francisco and San Bruno stations in San Mateo County. Zone 2 comprises most stations in San Mateo County. Zone 3 comprises stations in northern Santa Clara County, plus Menlo Park station in San Mateo County. Zone 4 comprises stations in central Santa Clara County. Zones 5 and 6, which are used only during rush hour, comprise stations in southern Santa Clara County.

Fares for Caltrain service are based on the number of zones traveled, which is considered to be the number of zones &quot;touched&quot; between the origin and destination. For instance, a passenger that boards at a Zone 1 station and departs at a Zone 1 station is considered to travel within one zone. A passenger that boards at a Zone 2 station and departs at a Zone 4 station is considered to travel within three zones (Zones 2, 3, and 4). When purchasing a ticket from the station ticket machine, the machine assumes the origin zone is the same as the station&#x27;s zone, and prompts the passenger to select a destination zone, but the origin zone can be changed if necessary.
;Notes
Zone ticketing requires little infrastructure at the stations but can be expensive for passengers making a short trip that crosses a zone boundary (each zone is 13 miles long). Travel between Sunnyvale and Lawrence is a two-zone ride, since Sunnyvale is the southernmost station in Zone 3 and Lawrence is the northernmost station in Zone 4. A ride between Sunnyvale and Lawrence covers and costs $6, the same as San Francisco [Zone 1] to Redwood City [southernmost station in Zone 2], which covers a distance of .

=== Payment ===

In August 2009 Caltrain became the fifth public transit agency in the San Francisco Bay Area to implement the Clipper card. Monthly passes are implemented exclusively through the Clipper card; in addition, some employer-sponsored annual Go passes are implemented through the Clipper card, starting in January 2019. All passengers who use the electronic Clipper card to ride (including holders of monthly and annual Go passes) must remember to &quot;tag on&quot; with their card prior to boarding and &quot;tag off&quot; with their card after exiting the train. If they board the train without tagging on, they will be subject to the same fines as riders without a ticket. Passengers with monthly passes must tag on and off at least once before the 15th of the month to activate the pass, unless the monthly pass was added through a physical card interaction at a retailer or add value machine.

Without a pass, stored cash on the Clipper card may be used to purchase a one-way ticket. Clipper card users receive a $0.55 discount on the one way full fares. When tagging on, the stored cash value on the Clipper card is debited the maximum one-way fare from the originating zone, where the card was tagged on prior to boarding the train. When tagging off, the stored cash value on the Clipper card is credited according to the destination zone when leaving the train; pass holders are credited the full amount that was debited when tagging off. If passengers who use the Clipper card fail to tag off when they exit the train, they will be charged &quot;the highest cash fare from [their] point of origin&quot;, including pass holders. Because of the initial maximum fare debit when tagging on, passengers are required to have at least $1.25 stored cash on the Clipper card to avoid exceeding the card&#x27;s allowable negative value limit when boarding Caltrain.

For example, if a passenger tags on and boards a northbound or southbound train at San Mateo (Zone 2), their Clipper card will be debited for a five-zone one-way fare (Zone 2 to Zone 6, which is the most distant theoretical destination from the origin point, a one-way fare debit of -$12.20); if that passenger travels south and tags off at Sunnyvale (Zone 3), their Clipper card will be credited for the three zones not traveled (Zones 4, 5, and 6; +$6.75 credit overall) so the net deduction from stored cash is a two-zone one-way fare (Zone 2 to 3, -$5.45 with Clipper cash discount), unless the passenger has a pass; in that case, the passenger would receive a $12.20 credit. In the example given, failing to tag off means the initial five-zone fare debit (Zone 2 to 6, -$12.20) would remain. Because pass holders are credited only when tagging off, pass holders also would be charged the five-zone fare debit if they forget to tag off.

Those who use a clipper card hear one beep or see a light flash when they tag on to begin their journey and see two flashes with a double beep when they tag off to end their trip. Three beeps mean the card does not have valid fare. This ensures Caltrain is universally accessible beyond many other Clipper card acceptance mechanisms.

In 2018, Caltrain rolled out a mobile app allowing riders to purchase fares from Android and iOS smartphones. The Caltrain Mobile app was written by moovel North America, which has written apps with similar functionality for Santa Clara Valley Transportation Agency and San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency.

=== Fare enforcement ===

Before 2018, passengers who were unable to show a viable ticket were subject to fines of up to $250 plus court fees. Approximately 2,100 riders are given verbal warnings or written citations per month for fare evasion, and, while the old system was in place, an average of 15 incidents of violence against conductors occurred every month as a result of fare enforcement. This has led to trains being delayed while waiting for the police to respond. The fines for fare evasion were collected by the superior court system of the county in which the ticket is issued, and were not returned to Caltrain. The complexity of the ticketing system meant that up to 65% of issued fine tickets were later overturned in court.

Caltrain moved to a more streamlined process of issuing citations, effective February 1, 2018. Rather than writing the citation on the spot, which takes up to fifteen minutes, the conductor will scan the photo ID, and an administrative penalty will be mailed to the address on record, bypassing the civil superior court system. In addition, the cost of the fine decreased to $75 per infraction, and Caltrain will retain the fees. However, passengers who accrue a third (or more) fare evasion citation will be subject to traditional fines and/or criminal penalties through the superior court system.

== Logos, markings, and liveries ==
During the initial years as the state was assuming control (1980–1985), locomotives and rolling stock were leased from Southern Pacific. The leased &quot;suburban&quot; and &quot;gallery&quot; coaches continued to wear SP&#x27;s standard dark grey. Locomotives wore SP&#x27;s &quot;Bloody Nose&quot; paint scheme.

An experimental scheme was applied to SP/CDTX #3187 and three gallery cars (SP/CDTX #3700, 3701, 3702), unveiled on May 15, 1982; the locomotive had a red nose and both locomotive and cars had the body painted silver (upper half) and dark blue (lower half) blue, separated by three stripes (blue, teal, and red). The scheme was nicknamed &quot;Rainbow&quot;, &quot;Postal Service&quot;, or &quot;Mailbox&quot;.

When new equipment was introduced in 1985, CalTrain adopted a new logo and painted the newly acquired silver EMD F40PH locomotives with teal and blue stripes, matching the colors in the Caltrans logo.

After the new Caltrain logo was adopted in 1997, the F40PH locomotives were repainted to gray with a black roof, and the MPI MP36 locomotives ordered for Baby Bullet service wore gray with red accents.

===Train numbering scheme===
Each train on the schedule is assigned a three-digit number indicating direction, sequence and stop pattern. With the transition to fully electric service between San Francisco and Tamien, using Stadler KISS EMUs, the entire three-digit train number and final destination are displayed on electronic destination signs visible on the leading (cab) car and the side windows of other cars. Caltrain adopted a modified train numbering scheme starting in September 2024:
* The first digit still indicates the service/stop pattern:
** 1xx trains are weekday local trains that make all regular stops.
** 4xx trains are weekday limited-service trains that run skip-stop between San Francisco and Redwood City, and local between Redwood City and San Jose Diridon.
** 5xx trains are weekday express trains, similar to the legacy Baby Bullet trains with a few additional stops.
** 6xx trains are weekend local trains that make all regular stops.
** 8xx trains are South County Connector diesel services operating between San Jose and Gilroy.
* The second and third digits are assigned sequentially within each stop pattern, starting from x01.
** The second and third digits still indicate the direction of the train; odd-numbered trains run northbound, and even-numbered trains run southbound.
** For example, 501 is the first northbound train that operates with the 5xx express service stop pattern, and 502 would be the first southbound train with the same 5xx stop pattern. Thus x03 is the second northbound train, x04 is the second southbound train, etc.

====Legacy schemes====

The practice of placarding train numbers, which provides basic information about the train&#x27;s direction and type of service, dates back to when the trains were operated by Southern Pacific. The train number placard was displayed on each leading element (locomotive or cab car), using a physical or electronic sign which may be changed by the engineer. The train number should not be confused with the locomotive or equipment number, which is the 9xx number permanently stenciled on each locomotive, or the three or four-digit number similarly painted on each piece of rolling stock. 

;Until 2021
All train number placards were physical signs capable of displaying two digits only until the MPI MP36 locomotives entered service in 2004, which can display three digits on an electronic sign. Prior to 2021, two-digit physical train number placards reflected the sequential train number, which are the last two digits of the three-digit train number.
* The first digit of the number posted on the trains indicated the stop pattern.
** The first digit for weekday trains was always 1, 2 or 3.
*** 1xx trains were local trains that made all regular stops.
*** 2xx trains were limited-service trains that skipped some stations. Each limited-service train used one of three or four stop patterns: local south of Redwood City, local north of Redwood City, or express services with approximately double the number of stops compared to Baby Bullet trains. In general, the split-local limited trains offered timed transfers at Menlo Park and Redwood City.
*** 3xx trains were Baby Bullet trains, which made the fewest stops.
** The first digit for weekend trains was always 4 or 8.
*** 4xx trains were local trains that made all stops.
*** 8xx trains were Weekend Baby Bullet trains that made fewer stops.
* The second and third digits indicated the sequence number of the train. For instance, x01 was the first train of the day.
** These digits also indicated the direction of the train; odd-numbered trains run northbound, and even-numbered trains run southbound. Thus x02 is the first southbound train of the day, x03 is the second northbound train of the day, etc.

;2021 – 2024

Between August 30, 2021, and September 2024, Caltrain used a modified numbering scheme.
* The first digit reflects the stopping pattern:
** 1xx were local weekday trains making all regular stops
** 2xx were local weekend trains making all regular stops
** 3xx were limited weekday trains which skip selected stops, running local service between Lawrence and Redwood City
** 4xx were limited weekday trains which skip selected stops, running local between San Mateo and San Bruno
** 5xx were limited weekday trains which skip selected stops, running local between Palo Alto and Redwood City
** 7xx were Baby Bullet/express weekday trains which have the fewest stops, either seven southbound or eight northbound stops between San Jose and San Francisco
* The second and third digits are assigned sequentially within the service type
** These continue to reflect the direction of travel, so even numbers = southbound and odd = northbound. For example, 504 is the second southbound train within the 5xx stopping pattern.

In addition, during this period, the information provided on the two-digit physical placards on the leading element of the train (either the control car, for northbound trains, or the locomotive, for southbound trains) was changed to provide the stop pattern only. Two-digit train placards combined the basic stopping scheme (L for local or limited, B for Baby Bullet service) with the first digit of the train number; for example, train 501 is the first northbound train with the 5xx limited stop pattern, and would carry &quot;L5&quot; on the physical placard; in the pre-2021 scheme, this train would have carried &quot;01&quot; instead.

==Rolling stock==
===Electric multiple units===

In August 2016, Caltrain awarded a $551 million contract to Stadler Rail, which would produce the trainsets needed for running on the electrified line. The award was for 96 Stadler KISS EMU cars arranged into 16 trainsets, scheduled to be delivered for testing by August 2019. Under the contract, Caltrain had the option to procure an additional 96 units in the future for an additional $385 million. In December 2018, Caltrain was reportedly carrying 65,000 passengers a day, and expected to have 240,000 daily riders in 2040. Therefore, after funding was received from the California State Transportation Agency&#x27;s Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program, Caltrain&#x27;s board approved the purchase of additional cars from Stadler, increasing the order from 16 six-car sets to 19 seven-car sets. 

In August 2023, Caltrain exercised an option order for four additional seven-car EMU trainsets ($220 million) and a single four-car battery electric multiple unit (BEMU) trainset ($80 million). This will result in a fleet of 23 EMU trainsets, six diesel-hauled trainsets, and one BEMU trainset by 2030, with over 90% of service using electric trains. The BEMU trainset will be used on the non-electrified portion of the corridor between Tamien and Gilroy.

New trains are double-decked and equipped for both platform heights in anticipation of sharing facilities with California High-Speed Rail trains. The six-car EMU traisets would have been long; as delivered, the seven-car EMU trains are . Units can reach speeds of , though operations will likely be limited to .

Acceleration and deceleration of the EMUs are substantially better than the legacy diesel-electric trains. The legacy locomotives offer a starting tractive effort of for an EMD F40PH-2 and for an MPI M36PH-3C, while a seven-car KISS EMU set has a starting tractive effort of .

The first Stadler KISS was completed by Stadler&#x27;s Salt Lake City factory in July 2020. It was taken to the Transportation Technology Center in Pueblo, Colorado, for high-speed testing.

Caltrain began public operation of its electrified trainsets on August 11, 2024, with two trainsets, adding more trains each week until the full rollout of electric service on September 21.

===Locomotives===
Prior to 1985, Caltrain used equipment leased from Southern Pacific, including SP/CDTX 3187, an EMD GP9 repainted in prototype Caltrain livery and other locomotives that had been used for the Peninsula Commute service. Since 1985, Caltrain has used the following locomotives, which are almost all powered by diesel engines:

Caltrain also leased a number of Amtrak F40PH&#x27;s in 1998 and 1999 while Caltrain&#x27;s F40PH-2&#x27;s were being overhauled.

Since September 2024, newer diesel locomotives have been retained for service between Gilroy and San Jose. Revenue service between San Francisco and Tamien is provided by electric multiple units. Older diesel locomotives (built before 1987) were sold to Lima, Peru.

===Legacy passenger cars===
Before the rollout of all-electric service between San Francisco and Tamien in September 2024, Caltrain diesel trains consisted of one locomotive and a five- or six-car consist. Trains ran in a puller configuration (led by the locomotive) towards San Jose and in a pusher configuration (led by the cab car) towards San Francisco, so the orientation of cars remained consistent.
Caltrain had 93 Nippon Sharyo bi-level Gallery-type cars and 41 Bombardier BiLevel Coaches in revenue service in 2017. Each revenue train consist was made up of a single type of car, i.e., the passenger cars in trains were either all gallery or all bilevel, never mixed. Of the Gallery cars, 66 were coaches and 27 were bike-accessible cab cars. Caltrans purchased the first 63 gallery cars in 1985 when it began subsidizing the commuter rail service. The other 30 were purchased by Caltrain in 2000, and the older cars were rebuilt by Nippon Sharyo around the same time.

The first 17 Bombardier BiLevel Coaches were purchased as surplus from Sounder Commuter Rail in 2002, of which 10 are coaches, 5 are cab-bike cars, and 2 are cab-wheelchair cars. Caltrain purchased an additional eight cars in 2008 to meet short-term passenger growth and to increase spare ratio. These Bombardier cars were initially only used on Baby Bullet express trains, but now also used on limited-stop and local trains.

Caltrain bought 14 remanufactured Budd Rail Diesel Car (&quot;Boise Budd&quot;) single-level cars from Virginia Railway Express around 2000 for use on Special-Event trains. A seven-car special train took fans to the first game at Pac Bell Park on March 31, 2000. The northbound train ran at an estimated 125% of capacity and skipped stops after Hillsdale because it was already well above seated capacity. These cars were sold in 2005 after Bombardier cars were delivered and are now in service on the Grand Canyon Railway.
Caltrain purchased 16 used Bombardier BiLevel Coaches from Metrolink in 2014 to cope with increasing ridership by lengthening certain Bombardier sets from five to six cars. The $15 million purchase was financed by a farebox revenue fund. Since the cars had retired from Metrolink service, they required rehabilitation before being placed in service with Caltrain. The ex-Metrolink cars were of older Series 1 and 2 that have riveted bodies, instead of the welded bodies in the Series 6 and 7 cars that Caltrain had purchased starting from 2002.

Ex-Metrolink cars retained their Metrolink blue-on-white livery, but Metrolink logos were painted over and rolling stock numbers were repainted with JPBX numbers. All five-car Bombardier sets were lengthened to six-car Bombardier sets using surplus ex-Metrolink cars in May 2015. In July 2016, six-car Bombardier sets replaced some five-car gallery sets to relieve overcrowding. In November 2016, Caltrain rolled out six-car gallery sets for certain trains to further relieve overcrowding; the longer trains were a temporary measures to increase capacity until more frequent service can be achieved with electrification.

After September 2024, electric multiple units displaced the legacy diesel locomotive and passenger car fleet for service between San Francisco and Tamien. The newer MPI diesel locomotives and bilevel passenger cars have been retained for service on the southern segment between San Jose and Gilroy. 19 locomotives and 90 gallery cars, built between 1985 and 1987, have been sold at a nominal price of US$6 million to Lima, Peru, and will be used in a new commuter rail service; the service is predicted to displace the equivalent of 4,000 cars per day between the eastern suburbs (Chosica) and the seashore (Callao) in the Lima metropolitan area.

===Miscellaneous/Maintenance-of-Way===
Caltrain has several cars used for track maintenance, such as JPBX 505, a track geometry car. Some other rolling stock is infrequently used for special service, such as on the Holiday Train, an annual non-revenue train decorated with lights, carrying volunteer carolers, and making limited stops for toy donations. The annual event began in 2001. It is sponsored by the Silicon Valley Community Foundation.

==Intermodal connections==

===Inter-City, Regional and Commuter rail===
Caltrain has direct connections to three regional rail services; Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) (with service to San Francisco, SFO, Oakland, Fremont, Richmond, Dublin, Concord, and Pittsburg) at Millbrae, Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Capitol Corridor&quot; and &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; trains, as well as the &quot;Altamont Corridor Express&quot; at San Jose Diridon station and the Santa Clara Transit Center.

The future San Jose BART extension would also introduce connecting BART service at Diridon station and Santa Clara station. The proposed Downtown Rail Extension (now known as The Portal), if completed, would connect Caltrain and the California High-Speed Rail project to BART in San Francisco proper through an underground pedestrian walkway between Caltrain platforms at the Salesforce Transit Center and BART&#x27;s Embarcadero station. 

===Bus/Light rail===

Caltrain is served by a number of local bus/rail systems. These systems include the San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni), San Mateo County Transit District (SamTrans) and Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA). (Additionally, Golden Gate Transit of Marin and Sonoma Counties is within 20 minutes&#x27; walking distance, or a short Muni ride via the N or T lines, from Caltrain&#x27;s northern terminus.)

In August 2005, as part of its Vasona light rail project, VTA light rail established its third transfer point with Caltrain at San Jose&#x27;s central train station Diridon. In addition to many bus connections, VTA light rail service has two other Caltrain transfer points at San Jose&#x27;s Tamien and at Mountain View. 
The San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni) has two light rail connections, the N Judah and T Third Street lines, at separate stops near the San Francisco 4th and King station. Muni intended to establish another light rail connection to the Bayshore station at Visitacion Valley in southern San Francisco for the T Third line, but this has been delayed indefinitely due to cost and design issues. The T Third opened on April 18, 2007, without the connection to Bayshore station. If the aforementioned Downtown Rail Extension (now known as The Portal) is completed, the underground walkway between the Salesforce Transit Center and Embarcadero station would also connect Caltrain to Muni Metro&#x27;s F Market &amp; Wharves, J Church, K Ingleside, and M Ocean View, as well as providing a second connection to the N Judah and linking Caltrain with the California street cable car line. The extension to the Salesforce Transit Center would also directly link Caltrain with more Muni bus routes, transbay buses operated by AC Transit and Golden Gate Transit, and intercity buses operated by Greyhound and Megabus, as well as place Caltrain within walking distance of the Ferry Building.

===Airport===

;San Francisco
Caltrain passengers may transfer to BART or SamTrans at the Millbrae Intermodal Station for travel to San Francisco International Airport (SFO).

Prior to the opening of the BART SFO extension in 2003, a free shuttle bus operated between Millbrae and the airport. On June 24, 2018, SamTrans launched Route SFO, which provides service using buses equipped with luggage racks between the station platform at Millbrae and regular samTrans SFO terminal stops. Fares on Route SFO match samTrans local pricing. Due to low ridership, as part of the Reimagine SamTrans plan implementation, Route SFO was discontinued in summer 2022; route 292 was modified to connect Millbrae station with SFO.

;San Jose
Caltrain passengers can connect to San Jose International Airport by disembarking at the Santa Clara Transit Center and transferring to northbound VTA bus route 60 towards Milpitas, which boards at the bus bay adjacent to the southbound Caltrain platform. VTA generally uses specialized equipment for route 60 with buses branded &quot;Airport Flyer&quot; which are equipped with luggage racks in the center of the bus. In addition to Caltrain, route 60 also serves BART from its northern terminus of Milpitas station and serves VTA Light Rail with stops at Winchester and Metro/Airport station.

;Oakland
Passengers using public transit to travel through Oakland International Airport generally use the BART Oakland Airport Connector from Coliseum station, which means Caltrain passengers must transfer to BART since Caltrain does not run in the East Bay. For Caltrain passengers, Millbrae offers the most direct transfer between Caltrain and BART.
* Millbrae: transfer to BART by boarding a Red Line train and subsequently transfer to a southbound Blue (with a final destination of Dublin/Pleasanton) or Green Line (Berryessa) train at some point between Daly City and West Oakland.

Other stations also can be used to transfer to BART, involving one or more intermediate connections and transit systems. From north to south, these include:
* Hillsdale: transfer to AC Transit Line M at Hillsdale Shopping Center and then transfer to northbound BART Orange (Richmond) or Green Line (Daly City) service at Hayward. AC Transit Line M was suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic and has not been reinstated.
* Mountain View: transfer to VTA light rail by boarding the Orange Line, then transfer to northbound BART Orange (Richmond) or Green Line (Daly City) service at Milpitas.
* Palo Alto: transfer to AC Transit Line U and then transfer to northbound BART Orange or Green Line services at Fremont. Alternatively, transfer to Dumbarton Express and then transfer to a northbound BART Orange or Green Line train at Union City.
* San Jose Diridon: transfer to VTA light rail by boarding the Green Line at San Jose Diridon, then transfer to the VTA Orange Line at some point between Champion and Old Ironsides, and finally transfer to northbound BART Orange or Green Line at Milpitas.

===Regional express bus===
Caltrain is also served by AC Transit at Palo Alto station (Line U). This is in addition to the Dumbarton Express from Union City/Fremont at Palo Alto. Furthermore, Amtrak&#x27;s Highway 17 Express bus from Santa Cruz at San Jose, as well as San Benito County Express from Hollister and Monterey-Salinas Transit from Salinas at Gilroy.

===Bus shuttle===
Caltrain sponsors many shuttle routes serving local employers on the Peninsula and in Silicon Valley. Shuttle connections via the Stanford Marguerite Shuttle are available to Stanford University at the Palo Alto and California Avenue stations and San Jose State University at the San Jose station.

==Bicycle access==

Caltrain was one of the first commuter rail services to add bicycle capacity to its trains, inaugurating bicycle service in 1992 by allowing four bikes on certain trains. By 2016, up to 80 bicycles could be carried per train in two or three bike cars. After the EMU fleet entered revenue service in 2024, each seven-car train has two bike cars.

===Bicycle policies===
Legacy gallery and bilevel passenger cars with bike racks have a yellow &quot;Bike Car&quot; sign posted on the exterior next to the door. EMU bike cars have white bicycles stenciled on the windows of the doors. Cyclists are required to tie their bicycle to the rack with the bungee cord provided, and must be racked so they do not protrude into the aisle. Each rack can accommodate four bicycles. Because the bikes are stacked together against the racks, most riders place a destination tag, available from a conductor, on their bicycles to optimize placement and minimize shuffling.

Cyclists must be at least six years old, and cyclists younger than 12 must be accompanied by an adult and capable of carrying their own bike on and off the train. Bicycles must be single-rider, with a maximum of in length, and tandem or three-wheel bikes are not allowed. Bulky attachments such as training wheels, trailers, saddlebags, and baskets are similarly not allowed. Folding bicycles are not restricted and can be carried on any car when folded; they may not be placed on seats or block aisles.

===History of bikes on Caltrain===

The initial pilot program launched in 1992 allowed up to four bikes per train for off-peak service, and bicycles were carried in the cab car (northernmost car). Bicycle capacity was expanded to twelve bikes per train for all trains in 1995, followed by a doubling to 24 bikes per train for all trains in 1996. Only the cab/control car of each train consist was modified for bicycle service.

Starting in 2001, additional gallery cars were modified for bicycle service. Gallery cars modified for bicycle service removed seats from the lower level in the north half of the car, resulting in space to carry 32 bicycles per car. By 2006, Bombardier cars were also modified for bicycle service by partially removing seats from the lower level of the car, resulting in space to carry 16 bicycles per car. Additional bicycle capacity was proposed by removing some seats from bicycle cars. Initially Caltrain rejected this idea because some trains are operated at seated capacity and the seat removal would take space from other passengers. However, in early 2009 Caltrain announced that it would be expanding bicycle capacity by 8 spots by removing some seats in the bike cars, bringing bike capacity to 40 bikes on gallery cars and 24 bikes on Bombardier cars. The expansion started several months later. After this, bike capacity on trains has been expanded by increasing the number of bike cars in a consist, rather than further modifying cars.

In fall 2009, all Bombardier consists and some gallery consists substituted a second bike car for one of the passenger trailers. The remaining gallery consists continued with a single bike car, resulting in a carrying capacity of 48 bicycles on Bombardier consists or 40–80 bicycles on gallery consists with one or two bike cars, respectively. Due to demand, in 2011, the remaining gallery sets modified a passenger trailer to take bicycles, giving two bike cars to all consists, increasing capacity on all gallery consists to 80 bicycles per train. 10 gallery trailer cars, 3826-3835, had their lower-level seats removed in 2011. Although the Baby Bullet runs initially used five-car Bombardier consists, many of the Baby Bullet runs returned to five-car gallery sets due to their superior bicycle capacity, since demand for bicycle car access was high.

Prior to 2016, both Bombardier and gallery trains used five-car consists. With the purchase of Bombardier cars from Metrolink, Caltrain announced in January 2015 that roughly half of the additional ex-Metrolink cars will be converted to bike cars with capacity for 24 bikes, so some trains running Bombardier cars will be six-car consists, of which three will be bike cars.

Six-car Bombardier consists started running in May 2015, but the third car was not converted for bike service until March 2016. Five of the Bombardier cars were refurbished as bike cars and entered service in March 2016. All Bombardier consists are now six-car sets with three bike cars and three passenger cars. The third bike car is just south of the existing southern bike car. The third bike car is being placed next to the other bike car to help conductors to manage bike capacity. Official bike capacity for six-car Bombardier consists is 72 (24 bikes × 3 cars), comparable to the 80-bike capacity of five-car gallery consists (40 bikes × 2 cars).

The EMUs which began revenue service in 2024 have two bicycle cars with a total capacity of 72 bikes per train, carrying 36 bicycles in each car.

===Capacity issues===

The variation on bicycle capacity between trainsets generated criticisms from the bicycling community, as cyclists may be denied boarding when a train reaches its bicycle capacity. The Baby Bullets, favored by many cyclists, often used lower bike-capacity Bombardier cars and some cyclists had to wait for slower trains with higher-capacity gallery cars, or seek alternate transportation.

Due to equipment rotation and maintenance concerns, Caltrain said in 2009 that it could not dedicate cars with higher bike capacity on trains with high bike demand. Eventually, two bike cars were added to every train consist by 2011, and in 2016, a third bike car was added to Bombardier consists.

To provide an alternative to bringing bicycles on board the trains, Caltrain has installed bicycle lockers at most stations, and constructed a new bicycle station at the San Francisco station. In early 2008, Caltrain sponsored Warm Planet bicycle station opened at the 4th and Townsend terminus. A bicycle station was open at the Palo Alto station from April 1999 to October 2004, and reopened in February 2007. Nearly all stations have racks and/or lockers available to park bicycles.

<text>The Al-Kabri massacre occurred when the Israeli army attacked the Palestinian village of Al-Kabri on the night of May 20-21 1948, during the 1948 Palestine war. The attack was part of Operation Ben-Ami, itself a part of Plan Dalet. Orders were given to &quot;attack with the aim of capturing, the villages of Kabri, Umm al Faraj and Al-Nahr, to kill the men [and] to destroy and set fire to the villages&quot;, orders which Meron Benvenisti states were &quot;carried out to the letter&quot;. At least seven people were killed. The attack was committed partially as revenge for the March 27 Yehiam convoy ambush.

==Attack==
On the night of May 20-21, 1948, the Israeli Carmeli Brigade captured al-Kabri (), a Palestinian Arab village in the northwest corner of the region of the British Mandate of Palestine that was later incorporated into the State of Israel. Historian Saleh Abdel Jawad writes that Moshe Carmeli gave orders &quot;to attack with the aim of conquest, the killing of adult males, destruction and torching.&quot; Al-Kabri was captured without any resistance and it was almost immediately depopulated. It was treated particularly harshly due to the villagers involvement with the destruction of the Jewish convoy. According to Walid Khalidi, an &#x27;undisclosed number of villagers were taken prisoner and some were killed&#x27; and others were killed during their dispersal in Galilee when it was discovered that they had come from al-Kabri. Jawad writes &quot;seven young men murdered.&quot;

==Historiography==
Historian Benny Morris wrote that &quot;a number of villagers&quot; were &quot;apparently executed.&quot;

==Firsthand accounts==
Dov Yirmiya of the IDF took part in the attack on al-Kabri. He reported:
&quot;Kabri was conquered without a fight. Almost all inhabitants fled. One of the soldiers, Yehuda Reshef, who was together with his brother among the few escapees from the Yehi’am convoy, got hold of a few youngsters who did not escape, probably seven, ordered them to fill up some ditches dug as an obstacle and then lined them up and fired at them with a machine gun. A few died but some of the wounded succeeded to escape.&quot;

Aminah Muhammad Musa, a Palestinian refugee from al-Kabri testified:
&quot;My husband and I left Kabri the day before it fell... At dawn [the next day], while my husband was preparing for his morning prayer, our friend Raja passed us and urged us to proceed, saying that we should run... It was not too long before we were met by the Jews... They took us and a few other villagers... in an armoured car back to the village. There a Jewish officer interrogated us and, putting a gun to my husband&#x27;s neck, he said &quot;You are from Kabri?&quot;... The Jews took away my husband, Ibrahim Dabajah, Hussain Hassan al-Khubaizah, Khalil al-Tamlawi, Uthman Iban As&#x27;ad Mahmud, and Raja. They left the rest of us... An officer came to me and asked me not to cry. We slept in the village orchards that night. The next morning, Umm Hussain and I went to the village... I saw Umm Taha on the way to the village courtyard. She cried and said &quot;You had better go see your dead husband.&quot; I found him. He was shot in the back of the head.&quot;

<text>Thomas Joseph Hagerty (c. 1862 – sometime in the 1920s) was an American Roman Catholic priest and trade union activist. Hagerty is remembered as one of the founding members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), as author of the influential Preamble to the Constitution of the IWW, and as the creator of &quot;Hagerty&#x27;s Wheel&quot;, a frequently reproduced illustration depicting the interrelation of the IWW&#x27;s constituent industrial unions.

In November 1914, Hagerty alongside Benjamin F. Morris, executives on the International Board of Directors of the United Mine Workers, traveled to Indianapolis to assist in negotiating terms and basic labor rights for coal miners on strike in West Virginia, Arkansas, and Colorado that led to and end of the strike. 

Hagerty abruptly abandoned the radical movement shortly after the formation of the IWW, adopting the pseudonym &quot;Ricardo Moreno&quot; and working as a Spanish teacher and an oculist. After 1920 Hagerty lived on the streets of Chicago in conditions of dire poverty, eking out a meager existence as a beggar.

==Biography==

===Activist priest===

Little is known about the early years of Thomas Joseph Hagerty, prior to his completion of seminary training in 1895. He is believed to have become a Marxist about 1892 and to have spent his early life attempting to rectify the teachings of the church and the socialist movement.

Hagerty&#x27;s first posting was to St. Agatha&#x27;s Parish in Chicago in 1895, where he served as assistant to the rector. He was assigned to St. Joseph&#x27;s Church in Cleburne, Texas in the Diocese of Dallas in 1897 before being promoted to rector of Our Lady of Victory Church in Paris, Texas in 1901. He was transferred to Our Lady of Sorrows Church in Las Vegas, New Mexico later that same year.

As a Catholic priest in the Southwestern United States Hagerty came into frequent contact with Mexican railroad workers, the mistreatment of whom by their employers angered him. Finding little socialist writing to be available in Spanish, Hagerty began translating a number of short works from German, French, and English. Hagerty was warned by the railroads to stay out of labor relations, he told a messenger &quot;Tell the people who sent you here that I have a brace of Colts and can hit a dime at twenty paces.&quot;

Upon arriving in New Mexico in 1901, Hagerty became associated with the American Labor Union (ALU) and the Western Federation of Miners (WFM). During the summer of 1902, Hagerty went on a tour of mining camps in Colorado with Socialist Party of America (SPA) orator Eugene V. Debs, attempting to recruit the impoverished miners to the ALU and the SPA. This blatantly political activity brought Hagerty into conflict with his superiors, resulting in his suspension by his archbishop.

Despite this fall from grace with the church hierarchy, Hagerty continued to consider himself a priest in good standing, writing in &quot;International Socialist Review&quot; that
&quot;While it is true that I have withdrawn from the technical work of the ministry, the withdrawal implies no derogation of my sacerdotal character. I am as much a priest today as I ever was. I have not separated myself from the communion of the Catholic Church; and I hold myself as much a member thereof as the Pope himself.&quot;

Hagerty remained defiant of his superiors, declaring that &quot;bishops and priests exceed their authority when they use the influence of their position to oppose a movement whose highest purpose is the industrial liberation of the wage slaves of the world.&quot; Catholics were &quot;not bound to pay any attention to them in such matters,&quot; Hagerty asserted, adding that the papal encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII against Socialism &quot;have no more authority than that which attaches to the opinions of any private theologian.&quot;

One chapter of Hagerty&#x27;s life was at an end. Another was beginning.

===Industrial union activist===

Hagerty was employed as a touring organizer for the Socialist Party in 1903, traveling the breadth of the United States to deliver lectures on behalf of the party. Hagerty proved of value to the Socialists for his ability to appeal to Catholic workers on the basis of the social gospel, standing in contrast to the conservative church establishment, which remained staunchly and outspokenly anti-socialist. Hagerty proved to be a skillful orator and authored several pamphlets as a written adjunct to his activities as a party lecturer.

Hagerty attempted to instill the idea that radical political ideas and traditional theological conceptions were fully independent. In his pamphlet &quot;Economic Discontent and Its Remedy,&quot; Hagerty wrote:
&quot;As a matter of fact, Socialism has no more to do with religion than astronomy or biology. Socialism is an economic science, not a system of dogmatic beliefs. It is as much beyond the scope of Socialism to deal with Divine revelation as it is beyond the range of the Republican Party to advance a new exegesis of the Davidic Psalms.
&quot;If there are atheists and infidels in the Socialist Party, it is not the fault of Socialism. They have as much right to membership there as in any of the other political parties under a free government... No one would dream of censuring the Democratic Party because the founder of that party, Thomas Jefferson, was an infidel in the ecclesiastical sense of the term. There are many physicians who do not believe in God, yet no one is so ignorant as to condemn the science of Therapeutics on that account. One does not enquire into the religion of the architect before admiring some Corinthian structure which he has designed, nor the particular church affiliations of the bricklayer who built the walls of the house which one is about to buy or rent.&quot;

Hagerty was further radicalized during 1903 and 1904, a period marked by particular violence among the mining communities of the American west. Hagerty emerged as a leading critic of electorally-oriented socialist gradualists, who sought slow evolution towards the ultimate socialist goal by means of &quot;boring from within&quot; the established craft unions of the American Federation of Labor. Hagerty was not long in moving outside of the Socialist Party&#x27;s orbit altogether, changing the focus of his efforts to the construction of new radical industrial unions.
In 1904 Hagerty took a position as editor of a short-lived monthly publication of the American Labor Union called &quot;Voice of Labor,&quot; through which he gave voice to his ideas about organization of workers in industry. It was in this capacity as a leading union magazine editor of the day that Hagerty was invited early in January 1905 as one of 23 industrial union activists from 9 organizations to a secret Chicago conference for the planning of a new national union. Hagerty help to draft the gathering&#x27;s &quot;Industrial Union Manifesto,&quot; a document which was to serve as an intellectual foundation stone for the establishment of the Industrial Workers of the World at a convention later that same year.

At the founding convention Hagerty served as secretary of the Constitution Committee, and as such wrote the preamble to the IWW Constitution — a short and effective manifesto which became a fundamental element of the organization&#x27;s official doctrine for decades to follow. 

Hagerty favored direct action, as opposed to political action of the Socialist Party and its left wing rival, the Socialist Labor Party, referring to them as &quot;slowcialists.&quot; Emphasizing this point during a speech to the founding convention of the IWW, Hagerty declared:
&quot;The Ballot Box is simply a capitalist concession. Dropping pieces of paper into a hole in a box never did achieve emancipation of the working class, and in my opinion it never will.&quot;

=== Hagerty&#x27;s Wheel of Fortune ===

Hagerty also produced a circular graphic commonly known as &quot;Hagerty&#x27;s Wheel&quot;, which depicted the various industrial unions comprising the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) organization as interrelated spokes.

The diagram was around the clock divided into eight departments: Manufacture, Public Service, Distribution, Food Stuffs, Agriculture, Mining, Transportation, and Building, and in the centre a Central Administration. The diagram pretend to encompass &quot;every imaginable type of economic activity and form of employment.&quot;

It was Samuel Gompers who sarcastically labelled the diagram &quot;Father Hagerty&#x27;s Wheel of Fortune&quot;.

===Later years===
Shortly after the formation of the IWW in 1905, Thomas Hagerty suddenly dropped out of the radical union movement. Hagerty severed his connections with both the church and the IWW, adopted the pseudonym &quot;Ricardo Moreno&quot; and henceforth earned his living as a teacher of Spanish and an oculist.

From 1920 until the time of his death Hagerty-Moreno lived as a derelict on the streets of Chicago&#x27;s skid row. The few of his old comrades who located Hagerty in Chicago found him, in the words of Roland Boer, &quot;living in deep poverty, eventually reliant on soup kitchens, a few cents from passers-by, missions for a bed, and free concerts to keep up his cultural interests.&quot;

Hagerty-Moreno&#x27;s death passed unremarked, probably sometime in the 1920s.

<doc id="268236" wikidata="Q5231290" url="?curid=268236" title="David Bellotti">
<text>David Frank Bellotti (13 August 1943 – 10 June 2015) was a British Liberal Democrat politician who was Member of Parliament (MP) for the Eastbourne constituency from 1990 to 1992.

He was the first Liberal Democrat politician to win a parliamentary election, following the formation of the party through the merger of the Liberal Party and the SDP. He was also the most recent UK Member of Parliament to successfully take a seat from an opposing party following the assassination of the incumbent politician.

==Early life==
Bellotti attended Exeter School and then went on to complete diplomas in youth service and counselling. He studied part-time at the University of Sussex, gaining a MA in education policy.

==Political career==
Bellotti first contested the Eastbourne seat at the 1979 general election, subsequently fighting Lewes in the 1983 and 1987 general elections under the Liberal banner. He then won the parliamentary seat of Eastbourne for the Liberal Democrats in the 1990 by-election following the assassination of Conservative MP Ian Gow by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). He became the first person to be elected as a Liberal Democrat MP after the party was formed in 1988 by a merger of the Liberal Party and the SDP. Bellotti&#x27;s win was both unexpected and controversial, with Conservative MP Ann Widdecombe noting: &quot;Bellotti is the innocent beneficiary of murder. I suspect as last night as the Liberal Democrats were toasting their success, in its hideouts the IRA were doing the same thing&quot;. After Bellotti&#x27;s win, future by-elections resulting from assassinations of MPs saw most parties decline to contest the seat. The shock defeat contributed to the end of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s premiership in November 1990 as Conservative MPs worried if they could hold their seats at a general election if she remained prime minister.

Two years later Bellotti was defeated by Nigel Waterson in the 1992 general election in which John Major&#x27;s Conservative government was re-elected.

He subsequently unsuccessfully contested the East Sussex and Kent South constituency in the 1994 elections to the European Parliament.

Bellotti returned to local government, regaining a seat on East Sussex County Council and was elected chairman of Sussex Police Authority. He then became CEO of Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, a position in which he controversially took part in the sale of the indebted football club&#x27;s stadium after their articles of association had been changed, allowing for profit to be made on the sale of the Goldstone Ground. This change was however reversed on the insistence of the Football Association, preventing directors from taking out more than they had invested. Bellotti became reviled by Brighton fans and left the area shortly afterwards.

After leaving the football club and losing his council seat Bellotti moved to Bath and became election agent for Don Foster MP. In May 2003 David Bellotti was elected councillor for Lyncombe ward on Bath and North East Somerset council and was re-elected in 2007 and 2011. He was appointed as chairman of the council for 2008/9 and was the council&#x27;s cabinet member for resources for four years. He died on 10 June 2015, aged 71.

==Personal life==
Bellotti married three times. His first wife was Shelia Jones, whom he married in 1965, and they had a son and a daughter. He then married Jennifer Compson in 1973, with the couple having a son. His third wife was Jo Brown whom he married in 1996, and with whom he had a son and daughter.

<doc id="268245" wikidata="Q1452633" url="?curid=268245" title="Hula massacre">
<text>The Hula massacre took place between 31 October and 1 November 1948 in Hula, a village in Lebanon 3 km west of Kibbutz Manara, not far from the Litani River. It was captured on October 24 by the Carmeli Brigade of the Israel Defense Forces without any resistance. The women and children were expelled, most of the men aged between 15 and 60 were shot. In total between 35 and 58 men were executed in a house which was later blown up on top of them. One Israeli officer was tried and convicted by a military court and sentenced to seven years in prison, though this sentence was reduced to one year on appeal.

== Aftermath and legal proceedings ==

Two officers were held responsible for the massacre, and were reported as war criminals by their superior, Dov Yermiya. One of them, First Lieutenant Shmuel Lahis, who served as company commander, was tried for murder by an Israeli military court. At his trial, Lahis put forth the defence that the crime had been committed outside the borders of Israel. The military court rejected this defence but gave Lahis a postponement so that he could appeal this point to the High Court of Justice. In the same HCJ case, the Israeli government argued that the HCJ did not have the right to interpret military law. In February 1949, the HCJ rejected both the claim of Lahis and the claim of the government, allowing the trial to continue.

Lahis was found guilty and sentenced to 7 years in prison. His sentence was reduced to one year on appeal, and he was released from prison in 1950. Lahis received a retrospective presidential amnesty in 1955.

=== Shmuel Lahis later life and controversy ===

Shmuel Lahis went on to become a lawyer and in 1978 became president of the Jewish Agency. Some Israelis opposed this appointment because of his involvement in the Hula massacre.

At the time of Lahis&#x27; nomination to head the Jewish Agency, Lahis&#x27;s immediate superior in the Carmeli Brigade, Dov Yermiya, wrote to Jewish Agency Chairman Arie Dulzin about Lahis&#x27; role in the 1948 massacre. After Lahis&#x27; appointment in the role, the controversy was reported in the Israeli media and caused debate in the Knesset. Yermiya&#x27;s letter was later published in the newspaper Al Hamishmar.

:&quot;I received a report that there had been no resistance in the village, that there was no enemy activity in the area, and that about a hundred people were left in the village. They had surrendered and requested to stay. The men among them were kept in one house under guard. I was brought there and saw about 35 men. [Yermiya does not remember the exact number today, and there were in fact over 50 men there] in the age range 15-60, including one Lebanese soldier in uniform [who was not killed]... When I returned to the village the following morning with an order to send the villagers away, I found out that, while I was away, two of the troops&#x27; officers had killed all of the captives who were in the house with a sub-machine gun, and had then blown up the house on top of them to be their grave. The women and children were sent west.&quot;

:&quot;When I asked him why he had done this, the officer answered that this was &#x27;his revenge for the murder of his best friends in the Haifa Oil Refinery massacre.&#x27;&quot; (Journal of Palestine Studies, vol. VII, no. 4 (summer 1978), no. 28, pp. 143-145)

Dulzin&#x27;s response to Yermiya&#x27;s letter said that Lahis&#x27; past had been known to the Jewish Agency since 1961. It also revealed that when Lahis had applied to be registered as a lawyer in 1955 the matter had been examined by the Israeli Legal Council. It was decided that the act which was the reason for Lahis&#x27; trial at the military courts was &quot;not an act that carries with it a stigma&quot; (quoted by Dulzin, as translated by JPS).

== Commemoration ==
During the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon a memorial to the victims of the massacre was defaced by Israeli soldiers.

<text>Wilbur Schwichtenberg (July 12, 1912 – July 15, 1989), known professionally as Will Bradley, was an American trombonist and bandleader during the 1930s and 1940s. He performed swing, dance music, and boogie-woogie songs, many of them written or co-written by Don Raye.

==Career==
Born in Newton, New Jersey, Wilbur Schwichtenberg was raised in Washington, New Jersey. In 1928, he moved to New York City and became a member of bands such as Red Nichols &amp; His Five Pennies. During the 1930s, except for one year with the Ray Noble orchestra, he was studio musician for CBS Radio, and was the resident hot trombonist on the network&#x27;s popular jam session &quot;The Saturday Night Swing Club&quot;. He also led the studio band for the &quot;Summer Silver Theater&quot; on CBS in 1941, with Ed Sullivan as the show&#x27;s host.

In 1939, he changed his name from Wilbur Schwichtenberg to Will Bradley, and started a big band with Ray McKinley, a swing drummer and vocalist from Texas. The band included Freddie Slack (piano), Arthur Rollini (saxophone), Peanuts Hucko (clarinet), and Pete Candoli (trumpet). Vocalists included Terry Allen, Carlotta Dale, Lynn Gardner, Steve Jordan, Ray McKinley, Phyllis Myles, Larry Southern, and Jimmy Valentine.

The Bradley band became well known for boogie-woogie, particularly with its hit record, &quot;Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar&quot;. The song reached the top ten of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s popular music chart, as did &quot;Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat&quot; and &quot;Down the Road a Piece&quot;. The latter song was recorded by the Will Bradley Trio (McKinley on drums, Slack on piano, and Doc Goldberg on bass), with the vocal by songwriter Don Raye.

James Roosevelt introduced a new concept in filmed entertainment: three-minute musical Soundies filmed for coin-operated &quot;movie jukeboxes.&quot; Will Bradley was one of the first bandleaders to work in Soundies (in December 1940; the others were Vincent Lopez and Ray Kinney).

In 1942, McKinley departed the Bradley outfit to form his own band, and Slack followed suit that same year. Bradley hired trumpeter Shorty Rogers and drummer Shelly Manne, but many members were drafted into the armed forces. Bradley dissolved his big band and returned to broadcasting. He remained in demand as a recording-studio musician; in the mid-forties he recorded as &quot;Will Bradley and His Boogie Woogie Boys,&quot; and he filmed more Soundies in 1944, leading a nine-piece combo. He played trombone for Jimmy Dorsey&#x27;s hit record &quot;So Rare&quot;. In December 1954 he signed with NBC Radio&#x27;s flagship station in New York, WRCA, joining many veterans of the big-band era to provide live music on the air. He continued to work in radio and television, including music for commercials. 

In 1956, Will Bradley&#x27;s former drummer Ray McKinley -- who had assumed leadership of the Miller band in 1945 -- formed a new Glenn Miller Orchestra at the request of Glenn Miller&#x27;s widow Helen. McKinley recruited Bradley as featured trombonist. They remained with the Miller band until 1966, when Helen Miller died.

==Death==
Will Bradley died on July 15, 1989, in Flemington, New Jersey, three days after his 77th birthday.

<text>Keystone is a small unincorporated community on Whidbey Island in Island County, Washington, in the northwestern United States. It is near the Keystone ferry landing, a dock at Keystone Harbor for the Washington State Ferries&#x27; Coupeville to Port Townsend route. The route provides a maritime link for State Route 20 across Admiralty Inlet to the Olympic Peninsula. Since its establishment in the 1930s, the ferry route to Port Townsend was known as the Keystone-Port Townsend Ferry; the name was changed in 2010 at the suggestion of the Central Whidbey Chamber of Commerce in order to avoid confusion from tourists and visitors to Whidbey Island.

Keystone is located about four miles south of Coupeville, next to Fort Casey State Park, Camp Casey, and is two miles from Ebey&#x27;s Prairie National Historic Preserve. There is a residential area and farms in Keystone, including the historic Crockett Barn located next to the Crockett Blockhouse and Crockett Lake. Currently, the only business in Keystone is Callen&#x27;s Restaurant, located directly across Highway 20 from the ferry landing and boat launch parking area.

<doc id="268250" wikidata="Q963914" url="?curid=268250" title="Kevin O'Higgins">
<text>Kevin Christopher O&#x27;Higgins (; 7 June 1892 – 10 July 1927) was an Irish politician who served as Vice-President of the Executive Council and Minister for Justice from 1922 to 1927, Minister for External Affairs from June 1927 to July 1927 and Minister for Economic Affairs from January 1922 to September 1922. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1918 to 1927.

He was part of early nationalist Sinn Féin, before going on to become a prominent member of Cumann na nGaedheal. In his capacity as Minister for Justice, O&#x27;Higgins established the Garda Síochána police force. His brother Thomas and nephews Tom and Michael were also elected TDs at various stages.

Along with Arthur Griffith, Michael Collins and Eoin O&#x27;Duffy, O&#x27;Higgins is an important figure in Irish nationalist historiography, representing a more &quot;conservative revolutionary&quot; position when contrasted with republicanism. After having a role in the Irish War of Independence, he went on to defend the nascent Irish Free State, as part of the pro-Treaty side in the Irish Civil War. During this time he signed the execution orders of seventy-seven prisoners. He was later assassinated in retaliation by an IRA unit in Booterstown, County Dublin.

==Background==
Kevin O&#x27;Higgins was born in Stradbally, County Laois, one of sixteen children of Dr. Thomas Higgins and Anne Sullivan, daughter of the Nationalist politician Timothy Daniel Sullivan. His aunt was married to the Nationalist Member of Parliament (MP) Tim Healy. He was educated at the Jesuit-run Clongowes Wood College, where he was expelled. O&#x27;Higgins was then moved to Knockbeg College, St. Marys Christian Brother School, Portlaoise. With a view to becoming a priest he went to St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth. There he broke the non-smoking rules, and was removed to Carlow Seminary. He attended University College Dublin.

O&#x27;Higgins joined the Irish Volunteers in 1915. He was efficient, had a forceful personality and was soon appointed captain of Stradbally company, Carlow brigade. He joined Sinn Féin, but was soon arrested and imprisoned in 1918. While he was in prison he became MP for Queen&#x27;s County (Laois).

==1919–1923==
In 1919, the First Dáil elected its &quot;Aireacht&quot; (Ministry) under the shadow of the Irish War of Independence. O&#x27;Higgins was appointed as the Assistant Minister for Local Government under W. T. Cosgrave. When Cosgrave was arrested in 1920, O&#x27;Higgins took the lead as head of the Ministry. Like other writers on Sinn Féin, O&#x27;Higgins believed the extremists were self-deluded; they themselves rejected the damning epithet &quot;extremist&quot;. When he wrote on disillusionment he articulated this fear:

Sinn Féin then split in 1922 over the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. In the debate that took place in the Dáil on the Treaty, O&#x27;Higgins outlined the reasons for his support thus:

When running for election in 1922, he told a crowd:

He was duly elected as a TD for Leix–Offaly, becoming Minister for Justice and External Affairs in the Provisional Government.

===Irish Civil War===

When the Irish Civil War broke out in June 1922, O&#x27;Higgins tried to restore law and order by introducing tough measures. Between then and mid-1923, he confirmed the sentences of execution of seventy-seven republican prisoners of war. The execution&#x27;s of Liam Mellows, Richard Barrett, Joe McKelvey and Rory O&#x27;Connor, was particularly noteworthy given O&#x27;Connor had been best man at his wedding to Brigid Cole the previous year, and, the men were executed for a crime that was legislated for after their imprisonment and were offered no trial. O&#x27;Higgins and his colleagues did not view them as prisoners of war, but rather as criminals. Today, the executions O&#x27;Higgins legislated for are seen as unconstitutional even by the Fine Gael party, the inheritors of the Pro-Treaty party. In 2022, then Taoiseach, Micheál Martin said the four executions were “murder by any definition and were seen so as that at the time”. The contemporary Labour Party leader Tom Johnson said the executions were &quot;utterly to destroy in the public mind the association of the Government with the idea of law. I am almost forced to say you have killed the new State at its birth&quot;. On 11 February 1923, the Anti-Treaty IRA killed his father, who had snatched a revolver from the leader of a raiding party in his family home in Stradbally, County Laois.

O&#x27;Higgins feared, as did many of his colleagues, that a prolonged civil conflict would give the British an excuse, in the eyes of the world, to reassert their control in the Free State. He was given a nominal posting to the Irish Army during the early stages of the war, which he described as &quot;very short, though very brilliant&quot;. General Richard Mulcahy was less impressed, recalling that &quot;O&#x27;Higgins&#x27; personal presence in the Adjutant-General&#x27;s office at that time (July–August 1922) was the personal presence of a person who didn&#x27;t understand what was going on&quot;.

In August 1922, following Collins&#x27; assassination, O&#x27;Higgins was moved from the Army to Ministry of Home Affairs. O&#x27;Higgins had formed a negative view of Cosgrave, having worked under him at Local Government, and was not happy when the latter was appointed President of the Executive Council. Of the alternatives Mulcahy had been seen as indecisive, pedantic and too close to the Army (opinions which the subsequent Kenmare incident would make widespread), whereas O&#x27;Higgins himself was not avowedly republican. In the Government of the 3rd Dáil, he would be classed, along with Desmond FitzGerald, as one of the “Donnybrook set&quot; – out of step with the rest on issues such as Irish language, autarky and militarism.

O&#x27;Higgins had set up the Garda Síochána, but by September 1922, the force was experiencing indiscipline in the ranks. He appointed Eoin O&#x27;Duffy as Garda Commissioner. At the time O&#x27;Duffy was a fine organiser and worked for the emergence of a respected and unarmed police force. O&#x27;Duffy insisted on a Catholic nationalist ethos to distinguish the Gardaí from their RIC predecessors. He became increasingly authoritarian in later years, however, a fact that caused several high-profile arguments between himself and O&#x27;Higgins. Cosgrave appointed O&#x27;Higgins as Vice-President in December that year.

==Politics and later career==
In March 1924, midway through the &#x27;Army Mutiny&#x27;, Minister Joseph McGrath resigned from the cabinet and President Cosgrave took sick leave. O&#x27;Higgins, as &quot;de facto&quot; head of government, reversed Cosgrave&#x27;s policy of appeasement and confronted the IRAO mutineers confounding their objectives. In June, the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 changed his title from Minister for Home Affairs to Minister for Justice.

As Minister for External Affairs he successfully increased Ireland&#x27;s autonomy within the Commonwealth of Nations. O&#x27;Higgins was seen very much as the &quot;strong man&quot; of the cabinet. He once described himself as one of &quot;the most conservative-minded revolutionaries that ever put through a successful revolution&quot;. Though far-left political enemies characterised him as having supposed &quot;fascist&quot; tendencies, O&#x27;Higgins was to the fore in resisting the small wing of Cumann na nGaedheal who looked to Italy for inspiration. He did not approve of feminism, for instance when asked by Leader of the Labour Party Thomas Johnson in the Dáil whether he believed giving women the vote had been a success, O&#x27;Higgins replied, &quot;I would not like to pronounce an opinion on it in public&quot;.

He famously derided the socialist influenced Democratic Programme of the First Dáil as &quot;mostly poetry&quot;. Before his death, he toyed with Arthur Griffith&#x27;s idea of a dual monarchy to end the Partition of Ireland.

==Assassination==
At approximately midday on Sunday 10 July 1927, O&#x27;Higgins was assassinated at the age of 35 by three anti-Treaty members of the IRA, Timothy Coughlan, Bill Gannon and Archie Doyle, in revenge for O&#x27;Higgins&#x27; part in the executions of 77 IRA prisoners during the civil war. O&#x27;Higgins had been walking from his home on Cross Avenue, Blackrock to mass on Booterstown Avenue. He had been accompanied by an armed garda detective but had sent the detective back to Blackrock to buy cigarettes. As he approached the junction with Booterstown Avenue, one of the assassins emerged from a parked car and shot him. O&#x27;Higgins ran a short distance before collapsing, and one of the assailants shot him again as he lay on the ground. The men then got back in their car and drove away. Despite being hit eight times, O&#x27;Higgins did not die for almost five hours. Harry White, the former IRA chief of staff explained the cause of the assassination as; &quot;As minister for justice, he ordered the murder of his former friends, Rory O’Connor, Liam Mellows, Dick Barrett and Joe McKelvey in Mountjoy Jail .. That’s why he was killed.&quot;

None of the three assassins was ever apprehended or charged, but Coughlan, a member of Fianna Fáil as well as the IRA, was killed in strange circumstances in Dublin, in 1928, by a police undercover agent whom he was attempting to murder. The other two (Doyle and Gannon) benefited from the amnesty to IRA members issued by Éamon de Valera, upon his assumption of power in 1932. Gannon, who died in 1965, joined the Communist Party of Ireland and played a central role in organising Irish volunteers for the Spanish Civil War. Yet in party publications, his part in assassinating O&#x27;Higgins is downplayed. Doyle remained a prominent IRA militant and took part in various acts in the early 1940s. He lived to an old age, dying in 1980, and continued to take pride in having killed O&#x27;Higgins.

==Legacy==
O&#x27;Higgins&#x27; body lay in state in the Mansion House before a state funeral held at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Westland Row. He was buried at Glasnevin Cemetery.

In 1927, a relief of O&#x27;Higgins was posthumously added to a 1923 cenotaph in the grounds of Leinster House dedicated to Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith. This was replaced in 1950, by a simpler granite obelisk commemorating Griffith, Collins and O&#x27;Higgins.

In July 2012, Taoiseach Enda Kenny unveiled a commemorative plaque to his memory at the site in Booterstown, at the junction of Cross Avenue and Booterstown Avenue, where he was shot. Red paint was sprayed over this memorial within its first week, and it was further damaged shortly afterwards. It was removed some two weeks later and has not returned.

His brother Thomas F. O&#x27;Higgins and nephews Tom O&#x27;Higgins and Michael O&#x27;Higgins were later elected TDs. His granddaughter Iseult O&#x27;Malley is a judge of the Supreme Court of Ireland.

<text>Septimania is a historical region in modern-day southern France. It referred to the western part of the Roman province of &quot;Gallia Narbonensis&quot; that passed to the control of the Visigoths in 462, when Septimania was ceded to their king, Theodoric II. During the Early Middle Ages, the region was variously known as Gallia Narbonensis, Gallia, or Narbonensis. The territory of Septimania roughly corresponds with the modern French former administrative region of Languedoc-Roussillon that merged into the new administrative region of Occitanie. In the Visigothic Kingdom, which became centred on Toledo by the end of the reign of Leovigild, Septimania was both an administrative province of the central royal government and an ecclesiastical province whose metropolitan was the Archbishop of Narbonne. Originally, the Goths may have maintained their hold on the Albigeois, but if so it was conquered by the time of Chilperic I. There is archaeological evidence that some enclaves of Visigothic population remained in Frankish Gaul, near the Septimanian border, after 507.

The region of Septimania was invaded by the Andalusian Muslims in 719, renamed as &quot;Arbūnah&quot; and turned into a military base for future operations by the Andalusian military commanders. It passed briefly to the Emirate of Córdoba, which had been expanding from the south during the same century, before its subsequent conquest by the Christian Franks in 759, who by the end of the 9th century renamed it as Gothia or the Gothic March (&quot;Marca Gothica&quot;). After the Frankish conquest of Narbonne in 759, the Muslim Arabs and Berbers were defeated by the Christian Franks and retreated to their Andalusian heartland after forty years of occupation, and the Carolingian king Pepin the Short came up reinforced. Septimania became a march of the Carolingian Empire and then West Francia down to the 13th century, though it was culturally and politically autonomous from the northern France-based central royal government. The region was under the influence of the people from the count territories of Toulouse, Provence, and ancient County of Barcelona. It was part of the wider cultural and linguistic region comprising the southern third of France known as Occitania. This area was finally brought under effective control of the French kings in the early 13th century as a result of the Albigensian Crusade, after which it was assigned governors. From the end of the thirteenth century Septimania evolved into the royal province of Languedoc.

The name &quot;Septimania&quot; may derive from the Roman name of the city of Béziers, &quot;Colonia Julia Septimanorum Baeterrae&quot;, which in turn alludes to the settlement of veterans of the Roman Seventh Legion in the city. The name can also be an allusion to the seven cities (&quot;civitates&quot;) of the territory: Béziers, Elne, Agde, Narbonne, Lodève, Maguelonne, and Nîmes. Septimania extended to a line halfway between the Mediterranean and the river Garonne in the northwest; in the east the Rhône separated it from Provence; and to the south its boundary was formed by the Pyrénées.

==Visigothic Narbonensis==

===Gothic acquisition===
Under Theodoric II, the Visigoths settled in Aquitaine as &quot;foederati&quot; of the Western Roman Empire (450s). Sidonius Apollinaris refers to Septimania as &quot;theirs&quot; during the reign of Avitus (455–456), but Sidonius is probably considering Visigothic settlement in and around Toulouse. The Visigoths were then holding the area around Toulouse against the legal claims of the Empire, though they had more than once offered to exchange it for the Auvergne.

In 462, the Empire, controlled by Ricimer in the name of Libius Severus, granted the Visigoths the western half of the province of Gallia Narbonensis in which to settle. The Visigoths additionally occupied Provence (eastern Narbonensis) and only in 475 did the Visigothic king, Euric, cede it to the Empire via a treaty whereby the emperor Julius Nepos recognised the Visigoths&#x27; full independence.

===Visigothic Kingdom of Narbonne===
The Visigoths, perhaps because they were Arian Christians, met with the opposition of the Catholic Franks in Gaul. The Franks allied with the &quot;Armorici&quot;, whose land was under constant threat from the Goths south of the Loire, and in 507 Clovis I, the Frankish king, invaded the Visigothic kingdom, whose capital lay in Toulouse, with the consent of the leading men of the tribe. Clovis defeated the Goths in the Battle of Vouillé and the child-king Amalaric was carried for safety into Iberia while Gesalec was elected to replace him and rule from Narbonne.

Clovis, his son Theuderic I, and his Burgundian allies proceeded to conquer most of Visigothic Gaul, including the Rouergue (507) and Toulouse (508). The attempt to take Carcassonne, a fortified site guarding the Septimanian coast, was defeated by the Ostrogoths (508) and Septimania thereafter remained in Visigothic hands, though the Burgundians managed to hold Narbonne for a time and drive Gesalec into exile. Border warfare between Gallo-Roman magnates, including bishops, had existed with the Visigoths during the last phase of the Empire and it continued under the Franks.

The Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great reconquered Narbonne from the Burgundians and retained it as the provincial capital. Theudis was appointed regent at Narbonne by Theodoric while Amalaric was still a minor in Iberia. In 509 Theodoric the Great created the first kingdom of Septimania, retaining its traditional capital at Narbonne. He appointed as his regent an Ostrogothic nobleman named Theudis. When Theodoric died in 526, Amalaric was elected king in his own right and he immediately made his capital in Narbonne. He ceded Provence, which had at some point passed back into Visigothic control, to the Ostrogothic king Athalaric. The Frankish king of Paris, Childebert I, invaded Septimania in 531 and chased Amalaric to Barcelona in response to pleas from his sister, Chrotilda, that her husband, Amalaric, had been mistreating her. The Franks however, did not try to hold the province and under Amalaric&#x27;s successor, the centre of gravity of the kingdom crossed the Pyrenees and Theudis made his capital in Barcelona.

===Gothic province of Gaul===
In the Visigothic Kingdom, which became centred on Toledo by the end of the reign of Leovigild, the province of Gallia Narbonensis, usually shortened to just Gallia or Narbonensis and never called Septimania, was both an administrative province of the central royal government and an ecclesiastical province whose metropolitan was the Archbishop of Narbonne. Originally, the Goths may have maintained their hold on the Albigeois, but if so it was conquered by the time of Chilperic I. There is archaeological evidence that some enclaves of Visigothic population remained in Frankish Gaul, near the Septimanian border, after 507. In 534, Prince Theudebert, son of Theuderic of Austrasia (Merovingian Frankish not Gothic) invaded Septimania in concert with Prince Gunthar son of King Chlothar. Gunthar stopped at Rodez and did not invade Septimania. Theudebert took and held the country as far as Béziers and Carbiriers from which he took the woman Deuteria as a wife. Theudebert and his half brother Childebert invaded Spain as far as Saragossa 534-538. At some point soon after this, the Visigoths regained the territory they had lost in Theudebert&#x27;s invasion.

The province of Gallia held a unique place in the Visigothic Kingdom, as it was the only province outside of Iberia, north of the Pyrénées, and bordering a strong foreign nation, in this case the Franks. The kings after Alaric II favoured Narbonne as a capital, but twice (611 and 531) were defeated and forced back to Barcelona by the Franks before Theudis moved the capital there permanently. Under Theodoric Septimania had been safe from Frankish assault, but was raided by Childebert I twice (531 and 541). When Liuva I succeeded to the throne in 568, Septimania was a dangerous frontier province and Iberia was wracked by revolts. Liuva granted Iberia to his son Leovigild and took Septimania to himself.

During the revolt of Hermenegild (583–585) against his father Leovigild, Septimania was invaded by Guntram, King of Burgundy, possibly in support of Hermenegild&#x27;s revolt, since the latter was married to his niece Ingundis. The Frankish attack of 585 was repulsed by Hermenegild&#x27;s brother Reccared, who was ruling Narbonensis as a sub-king. Hermenegild died at Tarragona that year and it is possible that he had escaped confinement in Valencia and was seeking to join up with his Frankish allies. Alternatively, the invasion may have occurred in response to Hermenegild&#x27;s death. Reccared meanwhile took Beaucaire (Ugernum) on the Rhône near Tarascon and Cabaret (a fort called Ram&#x27;s Head), both of which lay in Guntram&#x27;s kingdom. Guntram ignored two pleas for a peace in 586 and Reccared undertook the only Visigothic invasion of Francia in response. However, Guntram was not motivated solely by religious alliance with the fellow Catholic Hermenegild, for he invaded Septimania again in 589 and was roundly defeated near Carcassonne by Claudius, Duke of Lusitania. It is clear that the Franks, throughout the sixth century, had coveted Septimania, but were unable to take it and the invasion of 589 was the last attempt.

In the 7th century, Gallia often had its own governors or &quot;duces&quot; (dukes), who were typically Visigoths. Most public offices were also held by Goths, far out of proportion to their part of the population.

===Culture of Gothic Septimania===
The native population of Gallia was referred to by Visigothic and Iberian writers as the &quot;Gauls&quot; and there is a well-attested hatred between the Goths and the Gauls, which was atypical for the kingdom as a whole. The Gauls commonly insulted the Goths by comparing the strength of their men to that of Gaulish women, though the Iberians regarded themselves as the defenders and protectors of the Gauls. It is only in the time of Wamba (reigned 672–680) and Julian of Toledo, however, that a large Jewish population becomes evident in Septimania: Julian referred to it as a &quot;brothel of blaspheming Jews.&quot;

Thanks to the preserved canons of the Council of Narbonne of 590, a good deal can be known about surviving Gothic Pagan beliefs and practices in Visigothic Septimania. The Council may have been responding in part to the orders of the Third Council of Toledo, which found &quot;the sacrilege of idolatry [to be] firmly implanted throughout almost the whole of Iberia and Septimania.&quot; The traditional Roman practice of not working Thursdays in honour of Jupiter was still prevalent. The council set down penance to be done for not working on Thursday save for church festivals and commanded the practice of Martin of Braga, rest from rural work on Sundays, to be adopted. Also punished by the council were fortunetellers, who were publicly lashed and sold into slavery.

Different theories exist concerning the nature of the frontier between Visigothic Septimania and Frankish Gaul. On the one hand, cultural exchange is generally reputed to have been minimal, but the level of trading activity has been disputed. There have been few to no objects of Neustrian, Austrasian, or Burgundian provenance discovered in Septimania. However, a series of Germanic sarcophagi of a unique regional style, variously labelled Visigothic, Aquitainian, or southwestern Gallic, are prevalent on both sides of the Septimanian border. These sarcophagi are made of locally quarried marble from Saint-Béat and are of varied design, but with generally flat relief which distinguishes them from ancient Roman sarcophagi. Their production has been dated to either the 5th, 6th, or 7th century, with the second of these being considered the most likely today. However, if they were made in the 5th century, while both Aquitaine and Septimani were in Visigothic hands, their existence provides no evidence for a cultural osmosis across the Gothic-Frankish frontier.

A unique style of orange pottery was common in the 4th and 5th centuries in southern Gaul, but the later (6th century) examples culled from Septimania are more orange than their cousins from Aquitaine and Provence and are not found commonly outside of Septimania, a strong indicator that there was little commerce over the frontier or at its ports. In fact, Septimania helped to isolate both Aquitaine and Iberia from the rest of the Mediterranean world.

Coinage of the Visigothic Kingdom of Hispania did not circulate in Gaul outside of Septimania and Frankish coinage did not circulate in the Visigothic Kingdom, including Septimania. If there had been a significant amount of commerce over the frontier, the monies paid had to have been melted down immediately and re-minted as foreign coins have not been preserved across the frontier.

==Muslim-ruled and Frankish Septimania==


The region of Septimania, in southern Gaul, was the last unconquered province of the Visigothic Kingdom. The incursion into Septimania was motivated by the need to secure their territorial gains in Iberia. Arab and Berber Muslim forces began to campaign in Septimania in 719.

The Arab and Berber Muslim forces under al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani, &quot;wāli&quot; (governor-general) of al-Andalus, sweeping up the Iberian peninsula, by 719 had invaded the region of Septimania and deposed the local Visigothic Kingdom in 720. The region was renamed &quot;Arbūnah&quot; and turned into a military base for future operations by the Andalusian military commanders. Following the Islamic invasion, al-Andalus was divided into five administrative areas, roughly corresponding to present-day Andalusia, Galicia, Lusitania, Castile and Léon, Aragon, and Catalonia, and the ancient province of Septimania. With Narbonne secure, and equally important, its port, for the Arab mariners controlled various areas of the Western Mediterranean, al-Samh invaded the remaining Septimanian cities, still controlled by their Gothic counts, taking Alet, Béziers, Agde, Lodève, Maguelonne, and Nîmes.

By 721, al-Samh was reinforced and ready to lay siege to Toulouse, a possession that would open up the bordering region of Aquitaine to him on the same terms as Septimania. But his plans were thwarted in the disastrous battle of Toulouse in 721; the Aquitanian Christian army led by Odo the Great, Duke of Aquitaine defeated the Umayyad Muslim army and achieved a decisive and significant victory. The surviving Umayyad forces drove away from Aquitaine with immense losses, in which al-Samh was so seriously wounded that he soon died at Narbonne. Arab and Berber Muslim forces, soundly based in Narbonne and easily resupplied by sea, struck in the 720s, conquering Carcassonne on the north-western fringes of Septimania (725). In 731, the Berber lord of the region of Cerdagne, Uthman ibn Naissa, called &quot;Munuza&quot; by the Franks, was an ally of the Duke of Aquitaine Odo the Great after he revolted against the Emirate of Córdoba, but the rebel lord was killed by the Arab Umayyad commander Abd al-Rahman ibn Abd Allah al-Ghafiqi.

After capturing Bordeaux on the wake of Duke Hunald&#x27;s detachment attempt, the Carolingian king Charles Martel directed his attention to Septimania and Provence. While his reasons for leading a military expedition south remain unclear, it seems that he wanted to seal his newly secured grip on Burgundy, now threatened by Umayyad occupation of several cities lying in the lower Rhône, or maybe it provided the excuse he needed to intervene in this territory ruled by Visigothic and Roman law, far off from the Frankish centre in the north of Gaul. In 737, the Frankish king went on to attack Narbonne, but the local nobility of Gothic and Gallo-Roman stock had concluded different military and political arrangements to oppose the expanding Frankish realm. Charles Martel attempted to conquer the whole region of Septimania and besieged Narbonne in 737 but his forces were unable to take the city. However, when the Arabs sent reinforcements from Muslim-ruled Iberia, the Frankish Christian army intercepted them at the mouth of the River Berre (located in the present-day Département of Aude) and achieved a decisive and significant victory, after which the Frankish army marched on Nîmes. Islamic burials have been found in Nîmes.
Around 747, the government of the Septimania region (and the Upper March, from the Pyrénées to the Ebro River) was given to Umar ibn Umar. Umayyad rule collapsed by 750, and Umayyad territories in Europe were ruled autonomously by Yusuf ibn &#x27;Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri and his supporters. In 752, the Carolingian king Pepin the Short headed south to Septimania. The Gothic counts of Nîmes, Melguelh, Agde, and Béziers refused allegiance to the emir at Córdoba and declared their loyalty to the Frankish king—the Gothic count of Nîmes, Ansemund, having some authority over the remaining counts. The Gothic counts and the Franks then began to besiege Narbonne, where Count Miló was probably the count (as successor to Count Gilbert).

In 754, an anti-Frankish reaction, led by Ermeniard, killed Ansemund, but the uprising was without success and Radulf was designated new count by the Frankish court. About 755, Abd ar-Rahman ibn Uqba replaced Umar ibn Umar. In 759, Narbonne was not receiving reinforcements from al-Andalus, rife as it was with internal fights. Yusuf ibn &#x27;Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri, &quot;wali&quot; of al-Andalus, had to quash a rebellion in Zaragoza in 756, and immediately head south to fight Abd ar-Rahman I, who defeated him. Northeastern Iberia and the remainder of Septimania was left without any relevant commander in charge. Finally, the Gothic and Gallo-Roman defenders of Narbonne surrendered to the Frankish forces, proceeding to eliminate the Andalusian garrison after killing the Arab-Berber Muslim troops, and opening the gates of the stronghold to the investing forces of the Carolingian king. Previously, the Frankish king Pepin had promised to uphold and respect the Gothic laws and probably their own government, so garnering the allegiance of the Gothic nobility of Septimania.
Narbonne capitulated to the Franks in 759 only after Pepin promised the defenders of the city to uphold the Visigothic law, and the county was granted to Miló, the Gothic count in Muslim times, thus earning the loyalty of Septimanian Goths against Duke Waifer, the independent ruler (&quot;princeps&quot;) of Aquitaine. After the Frankish conquest of Narbonne in 759, the Muslim Arabs and Berbers were defeated by the Christian Franks and expelled to their Andalusian heartland after 40 years of occupation, and the Carolingian king Pepin the Short came up reinforced. The siege remained as a key battlefield in the context of the Carolingian expedition south to Provence and Septimania starting in 752. The Iberian Christian counter-offensive known as the &quot;Reconquista&quot; began in the early 8th century, when Andalusian Muslim forces managed to temporarily push into Aquitaine. In the wake of Narbonne&#x27;s submission, Pepin took Roussillon, and then directed his effort against Toulouse, Rouergue, and Albigeois in Aquitaine, leading to the battle for Aquitaine.

==Gothia in Carolingian times==
The region of Roussillon was taken by the Franks in 760. Pepin then diverted northwest to Aquitaine, triggering the war against Waifer of Aquitaine. Albi, Rouergue, Gévaudan, and the city of Toulouse were conquered. In 777, the wali of Barcelona, Sulayman al-Arabi, and the wali of Huesca Abu Taur, offered their submission to Charlemagne and also the submission of Husayn, wali of Zaragoza. When Charlemagne invaded the Upper March in 778, Husayn refused allegiance and he had to retire. In the Pyrénées, the Basques defeated his forces in Roncesvalles (August 15, 778).

The Frankish king found Septimania and the borderlands so devastated and depopulated by warfare, with the inhabitants hiding among the mountains, that he made grants of land that were some of the earliest identifiable fiefs to Visigothic and other refugees. Charlemagne also founded several monasteries in Septimania, around which the people gathered for protection. Beyond Septimania to the south Charlemagne established the Hispanic Marches in the borderlands of his empire. The territory passed to Louis, king in Aquitaine, but it was governed by Frankish margraves and then dukes (from 817) of Septimania.
The Frankish noble Bernat of Septimania was the ruler of these lands from 826 to 832. His career (he was beheaded in 844) characterized the turbulent 9th century in Septimania. His appointment as Count of Barcelona in 826 occasioned a general uprising of the Catalan lords (Bellonids) at this intrusion of Frankish power over the lands of &quot;Gothia&quot;. For suppressing Berenguer of Toulouse and the Catalans, Louis the Pious rewarded Bernat with a series of counties, which roughly delimit 9th century Septimania: Narbonne, Béziers, Agde, Magalona, Nîmes and Uzés. Rising against Charles the Bald in 843, Bernat was apprehended at Toulouse and beheaded. Bernat&#x27;s son, known as Bernat of Gothia, also served as Count of Barcelona and Girona, and as Margrave of Gothia and Septimania from 865 to 878.

Septimania became known as &quot;Gothia&quot; after the reign of Charlemagne. It retained these two names while it was ruled by the counts of Toulouse during early part of the Middle Ages, but other names became regionally more prominent such as, Roussillon, Conflent, Razès or Foix, and the name &quot;Gothia&quot; (along with the older name &quot;Septimania&quot;) faded away during the 10th century, as the region fractured into smaller feudal entities, which sometimes retained Carolingian titles, but lost their Carolingian character, as the culture of Septimania evolved into the culture of Languedoc. This fragmentation in small feudal entities and the resulting fading and the gradual shifting of the name &quot;Gothia&quot; are the most probable origins of the ancient geographical area known as &quot;Gathalania&quot; or &quot;Cathalania&quot; which has reached our days as the present region of Catalonia.

The name was used because the area was populated by a higher concentration of Goths than in surrounding regions. The rulers of this area, when joined with several counties, were titled the Marquesses of Gothia (and, also, the Dukes of Septimania).

<text>Burning Flipside (or Flipside) is an annual effigy burn, display of creative arts, and self-expression of performances staged in Central Texas near Austin. Modeled on and associated with Burning Man, Flipside was the first regional Burning Man event.

Lasting five days during the Memorial Day weekend, it is significantly smaller than Burning Man, with 3131 tickets sold in 2022, compared to about 80,000 participants for Burning Man. Participants build a temporary city called Pyropolis; all of the structures in this city are dismantled and removed at the end of the event. The main structure, the &quot;effigy&quot;, is burned the last night, as are many other pieces of art around Flipside.

==Organisation==
Flipside was initially organized under the auspices of a limited liability company called Austin Artistic Deconstruction. This entity was wound down and succeeded in 2001 by another LLC, Austin Artistic Reconstruction. This was in turn succeeded by a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, Catalyst Collective, in 2023.

The legal entity prohibits all commercial use of photographs, video, film or any other medium taken at Burning Flipside without written permission. Therefore, media from Flipside is inherently . This prohibition on commercial use of imagery appeared as early as 1999.

==Principles==

While Flipside, like all regional burns, adheres to the same principles as Burning Man in spirit, Flipside predates the formulation of Burning Man&#x27;s 10 Principles and never formally adopted them. Instead, Flipside formulated three principles that are more abstract and cover most of the same ground as Burning Man&#x27;s ten:

* Accountability
* Cooperation
* Self Expression

Despite this difference, Burning Flipside is regarded as a &quot;ten principles event.&quot;

===Other similarities===

&quot;No Vending.&quot; Flipside is a non-commercial event; sales of any commodity (the one exception being ice) for cash is not allowed and may cause eviction from the event. Instead, a gift economy is used. Giving one gift in exchange for another is considered good form, but any kind of quid pro quo is a violation of the gift-economy rules

&quot;Leave No Trace.&quot; An extension of the self-reliance principle applied to outdoor living, requiring all participants to respect their environment and clean up everything they bring in. Participants try to leave the site cleaner than they found it rather than in an identical condition.

&quot;Art Installations&quot;—Flipside community members bring art to the event for display, including large free-standing works, fire art, and interactive pieces.

&quot;Theme camps&quot;—Groups of participants who build a structure or area for public entertainment with an underlying theme. (Example: Casineaux Camp - A camp with a Casino Theme with real gambling style games, but using donated prizes and fake coins.)

&quot;Performances&quot;—Flipside has a number of performance spaces that are used by musicians, theatre groups, DJs, fire performers, pageants, and interactive performances.

==Differences from Burning Man==
Similar to Burning Man&#x27;s Black Rock Rangers, the Pyropolis Rangers mediate disputes and maintain security at the event; they wear a similar khaki uniform, and attempt to be non-intrusive to other participants. Unlike Burning Man, however, the event is not regularly patrolled by law enforcement, although they arrive quickly in the event of an emergency.

Flipside has some other differences from Burning Man. Flipside&#x27;s location is in a private camp area in the wooded, grassy Texas Hill Country, unlike the extremely flat, very dusty dried lake bed in Black Rock Desert where Burning Man is held. The Texas Hill Country features creeks, swimming holes, and tree-covered groves that make camping a more comfortable experience than the harsh high Nevada desert. Flipside is slightly more strict about the vending rule: the only thing sold is ice. The smaller size of the event creates a sense that one could meet everyone, as part of a temporary community that encompasses all the event participants. Almost every participant of Flipside, including the event&#x27;s organizers, pay to get in regardless of how much time they put in volunteering. The only exceptions Austin Artistic Reconstruction makes are four free tickets: two to the designer of the sticker, and two to the designer of the ticket.

Additionally, unlike Burning Man where the central effigy of a glowing neon man stays essentially unaltered from year to year (with alteration to its base and other design elements), the Flipside effigy changes radically with each event. For example, participants built and burned a 6-armed, cowboy hat-wearing Hanuman effigy in 2004, a rocket ship at the 2005 event, and a chalice at the 2006 event.

== Event history ==
&quot;Burning Man Texas&quot; was held in June 1998 by George Paap. It had 30 attendees, and featured the burning of a straw man built on site. Burning Flipside (named by Melody Byrd in Prost&#x27;s backyard) began in 1999.

From 1998 through 2005, the event was held at Recreation Plantation (), a private campground in neighboring Dripping Springs, Texas. Having outgrown that space, the event moved to a larger property in 2006, Flat Creek Crossing (). While this location allowed for potential future growth, the land is also more primitive, due to the presence of large cliffs, scorpions, mountain lions, and other hazards, some believe that the land is more dangerous than even the Black Rock Desert. In 2010, the event moved to Apache Pastures near San Gabriel, Texas and Rockdale, Texas. The endemic pecan trees offered shade and participant created trails provided access to the San Gabriel River, a larger body of water than was present at Flat Creek Crossing.

<text>Maud Gonne MacBride (; 21 December 1866 – 27 April 1953) was an Irish republican revolutionary, suffragette and actress. She was of Anglo-Irish descent and was won over to Irish nationalism by the plight of people evicted in the Land Wars. She actively agitated for home rule and then for the republic declared in 1916. During the 1930s, as a founding member of the Social Credit Party, she promoted the distributive programme of C. H. Douglas. Gonne was well known for being the muse and long-time love interest of Irish poet W. B. Yeats.

==Early life==
She was born in England at Tongham near Aldershot, Hampshire, as Edith Maud Gonne, the eldest daughter of Captain Thomas Gonne (1835–1886) of the 17th Lancers, and his wife, Edith Frith Gonne, born Cook (1844–1871). After her mother died while Maud was still a child, her father sent her to a boarding school in France to be educated. &quot;The Gonnes came from County Mayo, but my great-great grandfather was disinherited and sought fortune abroad trading in Spanish wine,&quot; she wrote. &quot;My grandfather was head of a prosperous firm with houses in London and Oporto – he destined my father to take charge of the foreign business and had him educated abroad. My father spoke 6 languages but had little taste for business, so he got a commission in the English army; his gift for languages secured for him diplomatic appointments in Austria, the Balkans and Russia, and he was as much at home in Paris as in Dublin.&quot;

==Early career==
===Dublin, London and Paris===
In 1882, her father, an army officer, was posted to Dublin. She accompanied him and remained with him until his death in 1886. With her sister Kathleen, Gonne spent an unhappy time in London under the guardianship of their uncle William Gonne. Unaware that she would inherit a fortune on her majority, she tried to become an actress, but became ill with the tuberculosis that stayed with her throughout her life; in the summer of 1887 she went to the French spa town of Royat in the Auvergne to recover.

In France, Gonne met Lucien Millevoye (1850–1918), a married journalist with fervid right-wing politics, a supporter of the revanchist General Boulanger. Her relationship with Millevoye, who was sixteen years her senior, was both sexually and politically driven. With Boulanger he would redeem France by regaining Alsace-Lorraine. Her mission was Ireland, and together they would constitute an alliance against the British Empire.

In December 1887 Maud Gonne inherited trust funds in excess of £13,000 and an unentailed sum from her mother&#x27;s estate. She was a very wealthy woman and was free to live as she pleased. She travelled early in 1888 on a clandestine Boulangist mission to Russia, where she met the notable &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; editor W. T. Stead, who wrote of meeting in St Petersburg &quot;one of the most beautiful women of the world&quot; (&quot;Review of Reviews&quot;, 7 June 1892). She returned to Ireland and worked for the release of Irish political prisoners from jail.

In 1889, she first met W. B. Yeats, who fell in love with her. Gonne was attracted to the occultist and spiritualist worlds deeply important to Yeats, asking his friends about the reality of reincarnation. In 1891 she briefly joined the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, an occultist organisation with which Yeats had involved himself.

In 1890, in France she again met Millevoye. They had a son, Georges, but the child died within the year, possibly of meningitis. Gonne was distraught, and buried him in a large memorial chapel. (Her distress remained with her; in her will she asked for Georges&#x27;s baby shoes to be interred with her). After the child&#x27;s death, she separated from Millevoye, but in late 1893 arranged to meet him at the mausoleum in Samois-sur-Seine and, next to their child&#x27;s sarcophagus, they had sexual intercourse. Her purpose was to conceive a baby with the same father, to whom the soul of Georges would transmigrate in metempsychosis. Gonne&#x27;s daughter by Millevoye, Iseult Gonne, was born in August 1894.

Gonne MacBride is known for having had anti-Semitic views. Historian D. G. Boyce described her as &quot;noisily anti-Semitic.&quot; The &quot;Dictionary of Irish Biography&quot; states that she believed in anti-Semitic and anti-Masonic theories.

===Inghinidhe na hÉireann===
During the 1890s, Gonne travelled extensively throughout England, Wales, Scotland and the United States campaigning for the nationalist cause, forming an organisation called the &quot;Irish League&quot; () in 1896.

In 1900, Gonne helped found (Daughters of Ireland). Twenty-nine women attended the first meeting. They decided to &quot;combat in every way English influence doing so much injury to the artistic taste and refinement of the Irish people.&quot;

At the same time, she conceived as a distinct voice for women in Irish affairs. In an early issue of , the organisation&#x27;s journal, the editorial proclaimed, &quot;Our desire to have a voice in directing the affairs of Ireland is not based on the &quot;failure of men&quot; to do so properly, but is the inherent right of women as loyal citizens and intelligent human souls.&quot;

===Sinn Féin===

In her autobiography she wrote, &quot;I have always hated war and am by nature and philosophy a pacifist, but it is the English who are forcing war on us, and the first principle of war is to kill the enemy.&quot;

A second organisation, the National Council, was formed in 1903 by Gonne and others, including Arthur Griffith, on the occasion of the visit of King Edward VII to Dublin. Its purpose was to lobby Dublin Corporation to refrain from presenting an address to the king. The motion to present an address was duly defeated, but the National Council remained in existence as a pressure group with the aim of increasing nationalist representation on local councils.

The first annual convention of the National Council on 28 November 1905 was notable for two things: the decision, by a majority vote (with Griffith dissenting), to open branches and organise on a national basis; and the presentation by Griffith of his &#x27;Hungarian&#x27; policy, which was now called the policy. This meeting is usually taken as the date of the foundation of the party.

==Acting==

In 1897, along with Yeats and Griffith, she organised protests against Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee. In April 1902, she took a leading role in Yeats&#x27;s play . She portrayed Cathleen, the &quot;old woman of Ireland&quot;, who mourns for her four provinces which had been &quot;lost&quot; to the British. She was already spending much of her time in Paris.

In the same year, she joined the Roman Catholic Church. She refused many marriage proposals from Yeats, not only because he was unwilling to convert to Catholicism and because she viewed him as insufficiently radical in his nationalism, but also because she believed his unrequited love for her had been a boon for his poetry and that the world should thank her for never having accepted his proposals. When Yeats told her he was not happy without her, she replied,
==Marriage==
In Paris in 1903, after having turned down at least four marriage proposals from Yeats between 1891 and 1901, Maud married Major John MacBride, who had led the Irish Transvaal Brigade against the British in the Second Boer War. The following year their son Seán MacBride was born. 
Afterwards Gonne and her husband agreed to end their marriage. She demanded sole custody of their son, but MacBride refused, and a divorce case began in Paris on 28 February 1905. The only charge against MacBride substantiated in court was that he had been drunk on one occasion during the marriage. A divorce was not granted, and MacBride was given the right to visit his son twice weekly.

After the marriage ended, Gonne made allegations of domestic violence and, according to W. B. Yeats, of sexual molestation of Iseult, her daughter from a previous relationship, then aged 11. Critics have suggested that Yeats may have fabricated his allegations due to his hatred of MacBride over Maud&#x27;s rejection of him in favour of MacBride. Neither the divorce papers submitted by Gonne nor Iseult&#x27;s own writings mention any such incident, which is unsurprising, given the reticence of the times around such matters, but Francis Stuart, Iseult&#x27;s later husband, attests to Iseult telling him about it. The allegation concerning Iseult was made by Maud to Anthony MacBride, John&#x27;s brother. Though Maud omitted it from court proceedings, the MacBride side raised it in court to have John&#x27;s name cleared. As Maud wrote to Yeats, MacBride succeeded in this. Yeats and some of his biographers have maintained that Iseult was a victim, and have omitted the court incident.

MacBride visited his son as allowed for a short time, but returned to Ireland and never saw him again. Gonne raised the boy in Paris. MacBride was executed in May 1916 along with James Connolly and other leaders of the Easter Rising. After MacBride&#x27;s death Gonne felt that she could safely return to live permanently in Ireland.

In 1917, Yeats, in his fifties, proposed first to Maud Gonne, who turned him down, and then to the 23-year-old Iseult, who did not accept either. He had known her since she was four, and often referred to her as his darling child and took a paternal interest in her writings (many Dubliners wrongly suspected that Yeats was her father). Iseult considered the proposal, but finally turned him down, because he was not really in love with her and it would upset her mother too much.

==Irish republicanism==

Known as the &quot;Irish Joan of Arc&quot;, Gonne became known for her Irish republican views on a variety of contemporary social issues in Ireland. During the era, she supported Irish Catholic tenant farmers in their struggles against the Protestant Ascendancy and the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) during the Land War. Gonne chaired several meetings of international groups to build sympathy for her causes among the American, British and French publics. During the Second Boer War, Gonne, along with a small group of republicans, supported the Boer republics by giving speeches and publishing newspaper articles advocating against Irish involvement in the war. Gonne became known for her eloquence in her political speeches and they were credited for animating the founding of new Irish nationalist organisations.

In April 1900, Gonne wrote an article titled &quot;The Famine Queen&quot; for the &quot;United Irishman&quot; newspaper on the occasion of a planned visit by Queen Victoria to Ireland. The newspaper was suppressed by the RIC but the article was republished in American newspapers.

Gonne remained very active in Paris. In 1913, she established , a French newspaper. She wanted to be considered seriously: her idea was to get affiliation with the English Red Cross, and wrote to Geneva to gain an international profile for the new nationalist organisation. In 1918, she was arrested in Dublin and imprisoned in England for six months.

She worked with the Irish White Cross for the relief of victims of violence. Gonne moved in upper-class circles. Lord French&#x27;s sister, Mrs Charlotte Despard was a famous suffragist, who was already a Sinn Feiner when she arrived in Dublin in 1920. She naturally accompanied Gonne on a tour of County Cork, seat of the most fervent revolutionary activity. Cork was under a Martial Law Area (MLA) prohibited to Irishmen and women outside the zone but the Viceroy&#x27;s sister had a pass.

In 1921, she opposed the Treaty and advocated the Republican side. The committee that set up White Cross in Ireland asked Gonne to join in January 1921 to distribute funds to victims administered by . She settled in Dublin in 1922. During the street battles she headed a delegation called The Women&#x27;s Peace Committee which approached the Dáil leadership, and her old friend Arthur Griffith. But they were unable to stop the indiscriminate shooting of civilians, being more interested in law and order. In August she set up a similar organisation, the Women&#x27;s Prisoner&#x27;s Defence League. The prisons were brutal and many women were locked up in men&#x27;s prisons. The League supported families wanting news of inmates. They worked for prisoners rights, began vigils, and published stories of tragic deaths. Through her friendship with Despard and opposition to government they were labeled &quot;Mad and Madame Desperate&quot;. Historians have related the extent of the damage done to her home at 75 St Stephen&#x27;s Green, when soldiers from the National Army ransacked the place. Gonne was arrested and taken to Mountjoy Jail. On 9 November 1922, the Sinn Féin Office was raided in Suffolk street; the Free State had swept the capital, rounding up opposition committing them to prison for internment. The evidence comes from Margaret Buckley, who as Secretary of Sinn Féin acted as legal representative for the women but there was nothing prudish about their concerted opposition to civil rights abuses.

On 10 April 1923, Gonne was arrested. The charges were: 1) painting banners for seditious demonstrations, and 2) preparing anti-government literature. According to the diary account of her colleague Hannah Moynihan: Last night [10th April] at 11pm, we heard the commotion which usually accompanies the arrival of new prisoners... we pestered the wardress and she told us there were four – Maud Gonne MacBride, her daughter Mrs Iseult Stuart and two lesser lights... Early this morning... we could see Maud walking majestically past our cell door leading on a leash a funny little lap dog which answered to the name that sounded like Wuzzo – Wuzzo. She was released on 28 April, after twenty days in custody. Months later the women spread a rumour that Nell Ryan had died in custody in order to gain a propaganda victory. Women continued to be arrested. On 1 June Gonne was standing in protest outside Kilmainham Jail with Dorothy Macardle, the writer and activist, and Iseult Stuart. They were supporting hunger striker Máire Comerford. Again the source for this story seems to be fellow ex-prisoner Hannah Moynihan.

==Other activism==
Gonne was a leading figure in the Catholic monetary reform movement in Ireland in the 1930s. Formed in 1932 as the Financial Freedom Federation, they became the Irish Social Credit Party in late 1935 and Gonne MacBride was a prominent member of the group throughout the 1930s. They were committed to reforming Ireland&#x27;s financial and economic systems by way of instituting reforms laid out in the inter-war period by the originator of social credit economics, Major C.H. Douglas. In the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; in 1936, Gonne criticised Ernest Blythe&#x27;s denunciation of social credit economics. Opening, she wrote; &quot;I read with amazement the report of Mr. Blythe&#x27;s broadcast attack on Social Credit. Major Douglas&#x27;s contention that production has outstripped distribution with disastrous results of unemployment and starvation, tending to war and anarchy is incontrovertible, and is apparent to all in the desperate scramble for markets, the restriction of output and destruction in almost every country of consumable goods, while millions of people who need these goods are allowed to starve.&quot;

In the 1930s, she was involved in the Friends of Soviet Russia organisation. She met and was photographed with the Indian independence leader Subhas Chandra Bose when he visited Ireland in 1936.

==Yeats&#x27;s muse==
Gonne was a muse for Yeats. Many of Yeats&#x27;s poems are inspired by her, or mention her, such as &quot;This, This Rude Knocking.&quot; He wrote the plays &quot;The Countess Cathleen&quot; and &quot;Cathleen ni Houlihan&quot; for her. 

Few poets have celebrated a woman&#x27;s beauty to the extent Yeats did in his lyric verse about Gonne. From his second book to &quot;Last Poems&quot;, she became the Rose, Helen of Troy (in &quot;No second Troy&quot;), the Ledaean Body (&quot;Leda and the Swan&quot; and &quot;Among School Children&quot;), &quot;Cathleen Ní Houlihan&quot;, Pallas Athene and Deirdre.

Why should I blame her that she filled my days With misery, or that she late Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways Or hurled the little streets upon the great. (from &#x27;No second Troy&#x27;, 1916)

Yeats&#x27;s 1893 poem &quot;On a Child&#x27;s Death&quot; is thought to have been inspired by the death of Gonne&#x27;s son Georges, whom Yeats thought Gonne had adopted. The poem was not published in Yeats&#x27;s lifetime; scholars say he did not want the poem to be part of his canon, as it is of uneven quality.

==Personal==
Maud Gonne MacBride published her autobiography in 1938, titled &quot;A Servant of the Queen&quot;, a reference to both a vision she had of the Irish queen of old, Kathleen Ni Houlihan and an ironic title considering Gonne&#x27;s Irish Nationalism and rejection of the British monarchy.

Iseult Gonne (1894–1954), her daughter with Millevoye, was educated at a Carmelite convent in Laval, France. When she returned to Ireland she was referred to as Maud&#x27;s niece or cousin rather than daughter. She was to attract the admiration of literary figures including Ezra Pound, Lennox Robinson and Liam O&#x27;Flaherty. In 1916, in his fifties, Yeats proposed to the 22-year-old Iseult who refused his advances. Many Dubliners had suspected that Yeats was her father. In 1920, she eloped to London with 17-year-old Irish-Australian Francis Stuart, who became a writer, and the couple later married.

Iseult was not acknowledged as her mother&#x27;s daughter in Maud Gonne&#x27;s will when Gonne died in 1953, possibly due to pressure from her half-brother Seán MacBride who did not want to reveal Maud&#x27;s relation to Millevoye. Iseult died less than a year later from heart disease.

Gonne&#x27;s son, Seán MacBride (1904–1988) was active in the IRA and in Irish republican politics. As Irish Foreign Minister (1948–1951) he was active the United Nations and helped secure ratification of the European Convention on Human Rights. He was later a founding member of Amnesty International and its Chairman, and he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1974.

Gonne died in Clonskeagh, aged 86, and is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin.

<doc id="268260" wikidata="Q356305" url="?curid=268260" title="Jamie Cullum">
<text>Jamie Paul Joseph Cullum (born 20 August 1979) is an English jazz-pop singer, pianist, songwriter and radio presenter. Although primarily a vocalist and pianist, he also accompanies himself on other instruments, including guitar and drums. He has recorded nine studio albums, three compilation albums, one live album and twenty-four singles. Since April 2010, he has presented a weekly Tuesday evening jazz show on BBC Radio 2.

==Early life==
Cullum&#x27;s Jewish father, whose own mother had fled Nazi Germany, was born in Jerusalem. His mother&#x27;s father was Indian and her mother was born in Burma. Following the Japanese invasion, the family left Burma and moved to Wales, when his mother was aged five.

Cullum was born in Rochford, Essex, but was brought up in Hullavington, Wiltshire. He failed his grade 4 piano exam, and by his own admission can barely read music. At 15, after attending Grittleton House School, he went to Sheldon School in Chippenham. He felt that he &quot;was on a pathway&quot; for a place at the University of Oxford; instead, he read English Literature and Film Studies at the University of Reading, from where he graduated with First-Class Honours.

==Career==
Cullum produced his first album, &quot;Heard It All Before&quot;, with only £480. It was released in 1999, with only 500 copies made. The success of the album led to an invitation to appear on Geoff Gascoyne&#x27;s album &quot;Songs of the Summer&quot;.

After graduating from Reading University, Cullum released his album &quot;Pointless Nostalgic&quot; (2002), which stirred interest from broadcasters Michael Parkinson and Melvyn Bragg.

Just after Cullum made his first television appearance, on &quot;Parkinson&quot;, in April 2003, he signed a £1m contract for three albums with Universal, who beat Sony in a bidding war. Cullum&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Twentysomething&quot;, released in October 2003, went platinum and became the No. 1 selling studio album by a jazz artist in the United Kingdom. Cullum ended 2003 as the UK&#x27;s biggest selling jazz artist of all time.

Although primarily a jazz musician, Cullum performs in a wide range of styles and is generally regarded as a &quot;crossover&quot; artist, with his musical roots firmly based in jazz. Cullum draws his inspiration from many different musicians and listens to an eclectic mix of music including Miles Davis.

A stomp box made from a small wooden block (not to be confused with an effect pedal for guitars) features in Cullum&#x27;s concerts. The box is used to amplify a musician&#x27;s tapping foot. Cullum found this in Melbourne, Australia and uses it to enhance upbeat and fast-paced songs such as &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;, originally by The White Stripes, and &quot;Gold Digger&quot;, originally by Kanye West. He also often uses a looping machine; this plays a major part in Cullum&#x27;s versions of &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; and &quot;Teardrop&quot; by Massive Attack. Cullum also beatboxes at most gigs.

As well as The White Stripes and Kanye West, Cullum has performed work by Massive Attack, Pharrell, Rihanna, Pussycat Dolls, Radiohead, Gnarls Barkley, Elton John, Justin Timberlake, John Legend, Joy Division, Lady Gaga and many others. He has performed with Deltron 3030, Kylie Minogue, Sugababes, will.i.am, Burt Bacharach and The Heritage Orchestra.

Cullum has played at many large music festivals, including Festival International de Jazz de Montréal (in 2006, 2009 and 2015), Montreux Jazz Festival (2004, 2009, 2014, 2016, 2018), Glastonbury (2004, 2009 and 2017), New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival (in 2005), Coachella (2005), South by Southwest (2004, 2006), North Sea Jazz Festival, the Hollywood Bowl (performing with the Count Basie Orchestra), the 2006 Playboy Jazz Festival, the 2007 Jakarta International Java Jazz Festival and the 2008 Monterey Jazz Festival. On 30 April 2006 Cullum played his biggest-ever crowd on Queensday in the Netherlands.

In February 2012, Germany picked Roman Lob with &quot;Standing Still&quot;, a composition by Cullum alongside Steve Robson and Wayne Hector, as their entry for the Eurovision Song Contest.

In October 2014, Cullum appeared in a comedy sketch with Jimmy Carr and Daisy Lowe, which was made for Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Feeling Nuts Comedy Night&quot; to raise awareness of testicular cancer.

On 30 April 2016, Cullum played at The White House in Washington, D.C., as part of the International Jazz Day Global Concert.

In January 2017, Cullum appeared as a member of the house band in ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Halcyon&quot;.

===&quot;Pointless Nostalgic&quot;===
On this album, Cullum created covers of old classics with new arrangements of Bob Dorough&#x27;s composition &quot;Devil May Care&quot;, Thelonious Monk&#x27;s &quot;Well You Needn&#x27;t&quot; and Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Necessarily So&quot;.

The song as recorded by Cullum (&quot;It Ain&#x27;t Necessarily So&quot;) is also used in the film &quot;The Anatomy of Hate; A Dialogue to Hope&quot; by Mike Ramsdell.

=== &quot;Twentysomething&quot; ===
Recorded at London&#x27;s Mayfair Studios and released in 2003, &quot;Twentysomething&quot; contains a mix of jazz standards, contemporary covers, and ballads. Due to the acoustic nature of the music, producer Stewart Levine chose to record and mix &quot;Twentysomething&quot; entirely on analogue tape.

The album includes jazz standards &quot;What a Diff&#x27;rence a Day Made&quot;, &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, and Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;I Get a Kick out of You&quot;, modern takes on &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; &quot;I Could Have Danced All Night&quot;, Jeff Buckley&#x27;s &quot;Lover, You Should Have Come Over&quot;, and Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot;, as well as new tracks written by Cullum and his brother Ben, including the first single from the album &quot;All at Sea&quot; and the title track &quot;Twentysomething&quot;.

=== &quot;Catching Tales&quot; ===
&quot;Catching Tales&quot; has been released on double vinyl, as was the first single, &quot;Get Your Way&quot;. A limited edition version of the &quot;Get Your Way&quot; single was released on red vinyl.
Cullum toured in support of &quot;Catching Tales&quot; from the end of October 2005 to December 2006.

=== &quot;The Pursuit&quot; ===
In June 2009, Cullum announced the title of his fourth studio album, &quot;The Pursuit&quot;. The album, which was released on 10 November 2009, was produced by Greg Wells, and the first single was &quot;I&#x27;m All Over It&quot;, written with Deacon Blue frontman, Ricky Ross.

&quot;The Pursuit&quot; was recorded in a variety of places: Cullum&#x27;s kitchen, a studio in L.A. and Terrified Studios (his own in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, London). Various musicians were used in the recording process. Songs recorded in L.A. mostly used session musicians and saw Wells and Cullum play various instruments including drums and bass. &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop The Music&quot;, the second single from the album (released as a download only in January 2010) was recorded with Chris Hill and Brad Webb. The track &quot;Gran Torino&quot;, written in collaboration with Clint Eastwood, was used as the title track of Eastwood&#x27;s 2008 movie of the same name and was nominated for the 2008 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.

From 2003 to 2008, Cullum played consistently with Geoff Gascoyne on bass, and Sebastiaan de Krom on drums. From 2003 until 2004 the trio was joined by Ben Castle on saxophone, John Hoare on trumpet, Barnaby Dickinson on trombone and Malcolm MacFarlane on guitar.
Sam Wedgwood (guitarist, bassist and trumpeter) later joined Cullum on tour, for a little over a year. At the end of 2005 Cullum was joined by Tom Richards (saxophonist, occasional guitarist and percussion). Soon after that Sam Wedgwood left to pursue his own solo musical career. At the beginning of 2006 Rory Simmons (trumpeter and guitarist) joined the band as a replacement, bringing the total number of band members (including Cullum himself) to five.

In late 2009, Cullum replaced Geoff Gascoyne (bass) and Sebastiaan de Krom (drums) with Chris Hill (bass) and Brad Webb (drums).

=== &quot;Momentum&quot; ===
Jamie Cullum&#x27;s album &quot;Momentum&quot; was released on 20 May 2013. In conjunction with the album, he performed six intimate gigs across Europe; the first was in London.

In an interview with NBHAP, Cullum said that &quot;Momentum&quot; is about the crossover period from being a young man while having one foot in the adult world, and about the balance of childish fantasies with grand and epic responsibilities.

=== &quot;Interlude&quot; ===
&quot;Interlude&quot; is an album consisting of jazz covers, released on 6 October 2014. Recorded with producer Benedic Lamdin of big band Nostalgia 77, and recorded in one take, the album was influenced by Cullum&#x27;s BBC Radio 2 weekly jazz show. The duets on the album include two acts for which Cullum&#x27;s radio show acted as a springboard for mainstream success: Laura Mvula featured on the track &quot;Good Morning Heartache&quot;, and Gregory Porter on the lead single &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot;.

Available in standard and deluxe versions, the latter including a DVD of Cullum&#x27;s full performance at Jazz à Vienne, and an exclusive photo booklet containing tour and studio pictures.

To celebrate the launch of his first pure jazz album, Cullum played at several jazz clubs, including Blue Note Jazz Club in New York, and London&#x27;s Ronnie Scott&#x27;s.

=== &quot;God Only Knows&quot; ===

In October 2014 Cullum was part of the 2014 BBC charity single &quot;God Only Knows&quot; for Children in Need. He appeared in the song&#x27;s video in a hot air balloon, wearing a salmon-coloured Alexander McQueen suit.

=== &quot;Taller&quot; ===
In February 2017, Cullum revealed he was working on his next studio album &quot;Taller&quot;, following the release of its first single &quot;Work of Art&quot; on 17 February.

=== Recent work ===
In July 2020, Cullum released the single &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up on Me&quot; on the Island Records label.

== Awards ==
The British Jazz Awards recognised Cullum&#x27;s growing success by awarding him the &quot;Rising Star&quot; award, at the 2003 ceremony in July. At the 2004 BRIT Awards, Cullum was nominated in the British Breakthrough Act category. He performed a live duet with Katie Melua of The Cure&#x27;s &quot;The Lovecats&quot; during the ceremony at Earl&#x27;s Court. At the 2005 BRIT Awards, Cullum was nominated for two awards: Best Male Artist and Best Live Act. In 2005, Cullum was nominated for a Grammy. He was named the BBC Radio 2&#x27;s Artist of the Year honors at the BBC Jazz Awards (as voted by listeners of Radio 2).

In 2007, Cullum won the Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club Award for Best British Male. He was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song for his composition &quot;Gran Torino&quot; for the Clint Eastwood film &quot;Gran Torino&quot;. At the 2013 Jazz FM awards, Cullum was a nominee for UK Jazz Artist of the Year.

== Projects ==
Cullum&#x27;s early music career saw him playing three or four times a week at PizzaExpress&#x27;s restaurants throughout London, gaining exposure and later his big break with Universal. In 2011 the &quot;Pizza Express Big Audition with Jamie Cullum&quot; competition gave singers, songwriters and musicians a platform and a chance to win a £5,000 prize and a residency at the restaurant chain&#x27;s Dean Street Jazz Club. 7,500 acts entered the competition and the final, held at the Addison&#x27;s Rooms in Kensington on 23 November, was judged by Cullum, Michael Parkinson, M People&#x27;s Heather Small and other music critics. The winning act was Offbeat South, an urban group of 18- to 21-year-olds from Croydon.

In 2021, alongside Sophie Ellis-Bextor and The Feeling, Cullum re-recorded the classic 1977 Fleetwood Mac song &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot; as part of the UK&#x27;s National Thank You Day on 4 July, to celebrate the work of the National Health Service. The single was released on 25 June.

In 2022, Cullum was among the artists who celebrated 60 years of music from James Bond films in a concert at the Royal Albert Hall.

== Personal life ==
Cullum married the English author and former model Sophie Dahl in a private ceremony in Hampshire on 9 January 2010. The couple first met at a charity concert where she performed a song. Their daughter was born in 2011 and their second daughter was born in 2013.

In 2011, a portrait of Cullum, painted by artist Joe Simpson, was exhibited around the UK, including a solo exhibition at the Royal Albert Hall.

Cullum was the guest for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; on 25 March 2012, where he created programme history by performing three of his chosen songs, live in the studio for the show. His disc choices included &quot;The Lamb&quot; by John Tavener, and &quot;Concerning the UFO Sighting near Highland Illinois&quot; by Sufjan Stevens. His favourite was &quot;I Think It&#x27;s Going to Rain Today&quot; by Randy Newman.

Cullum is a fan of Swindon Town Football Club.

<text>James Augustine O&#x27;Dea (26 April 1899 – 7 January 1965) was an Irish actor and comedian.

==Life==
Jimmy O&#x27;Dea was born at 11 Lower Bridge Street, Dublin, to James O&#x27;Dea, an ironmonger, and Martha O&#x27;Gorman, who kept a small toy shop. He was one of 11 children. His father had a shop in Capel Street. He was educated at the Irish Christian Brothers O&#x27;Connell School in North Richmond Street, Dublin, where a classmate was future Taoiseach Seán Lemass, by the Holy Ghost Fathers at Blackrock College, and by the Jesuits at Belvedere College. From a young age he was interested in taking to the stage; he co-founded an amateur acting group, the Kilronan Players, in 1917. But his father would not hear of it. O&#x27;Dea was apprenticed to an optician in Edinburgh, Scotland, where he qualified as an optician.

He returned to Dublin where, aged 21, he set up his own business which he was, eventually, to give to his sister, Rita. In his spare time, he took part in amateur productions of Ibsen and Chekhov. From 1920 he was in the Irish theatre in Hardwicke Street working with actor-producer John McDonagh. In 1922 he made a series of comedy films for Norman Whitten. After working in plays by Shaw for a few years he rejoined McDonagh in revues, the first of which, &quot;Dublin To-Night&quot;, was produced at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre in 1924. In 1927 he took to the stage full-time. In 1928, this company&#x27;s first production &quot;Here We Are&quot; won international acclaim, and in December of the same year it produced its first Christmas Pantomime, &quot;Sinbad the Sailor&quot;.

O&#x27;Dea formed a partnership with Harry O&#x27;Donovan (died 3 November 1973) whom he first met in a production of &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot; in 1924. Their first show was &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Here&quot; at Queen&#x27;s. For more than two decades beginning in 1929 the duo produced two shows a year in Dublin, first in the Olympia Theatre, then in the Gaiety. They created O&#x27;Dea&#x27;s most famous character, &quot;Mrs. Biddy Mulligan&quot;. The role drew on Jimmy&#x27;s previous manifestations as &quot;Dames&quot; in Variety performances and pantomimes. Biddy Mulligan was the representation (caricature, parody and stereotype) of a Dublin street-seller, with all the working-class repartee, wisdom and failings implicit. He made a number of recordings of sketches starring Mrs. Mulligan. Biddy Mulligan is referenced in many Dublin music hall songs such as &quot;Biddy Mulligan the Pride of the Coombe&quot;, &quot;Daffy the Belle of the Coombe&quot; and &quot;The Charladies&#x27; Ball&quot;.

O&#x27;Dea made some film appearances, such as &quot;Darby O&#x27;Gill and the Little People&quot; (1959) in which he played the leprechaun king Brian, and &quot;Johnny Nobody&quot; (1961) as a postman. He also had a successful career in pantomime and toured Ireland and England many times, and is much associated with actress Maureen Potter (1925–2004), with whom he often partnered.

O&#x27;Dea was also a prolific songwriter. Many of his songs are still well known to this day, some of them having been sung and recorded by Dublin singer Frank Harte. 

==Personal life==

O&#x27;Dea married Ursula Doyle. Maureen Potter was a bridesmaid. Seán Lemass, was best man; while Taoiseach, Lemass also gave the valedictory oration at O&#x27;Dea&#x27;s funeral in 1965. Jimmy O’Dea had one child – Christine O’Dea – who married Ursula Doyle&#x27;s brother Noel Doyle. Christine lives in Toronto. Christine and Noel had two boys, Donal and Eamonn. Eamonn has 2 daughters, Eve Siobhan and Bridget Kate.

==Death==
Jimmy O&#x27;Dea died at Dr Steevens&#x27; Hospital, Dublin, aged 65, on 7 January 1965.

<text>A tray is a shallow platform designed for the carrying of items. It can be fashioned from numerous materials, including silver, brass, sheet iron, paperboard, wood, melamine, and molded pulp. Trays range in cost from inexpensive molded pulp trays which are disposable and inexpensive melamine trays used in cafeterias, to mid-priced wooden trays used in a home, to expensive silver trays used in luxury hotels. Some examples have raised galleries, handles, and short feet for support.

Trays are flat, but with raised edges to stop things from sliding off them. They are made in a range of shapes but are commonly found in oval or rectangular forms, sometimes with cutout or attached handles with which to carry them.

A more elaborate device is the tray table, which is designed to accommodate a tray, or to serve as a tray itself. There are two primary kinds of tray tables. The TV tray table is typically a small table, which may have legs that fold to allow it to be carried like a tray. The airplane tray table is a tray built into the back of an airline seat, which folds down so that the person sitting in the seat behind the one containing the table can use it as a surface from which to eat meals served on the airplane.

==Examples==

* A butler&#x27;s tray often has a gallery, or deeper surround, handles on the long sides to facilitate carrying (usually cut into the surround), and a portable stand with folding legs. It is used for the service of drinks and generally serves as a convenient side table.
* A cafeteria tray is used for carrying items in a cafeteria. It is typically made of plastic or fiberglass. A compartment tray or mess tray is a cafeteria tray designed to be used directly, without dishes - it incorporates shallow compartments in which different types of food are placed.
*A , the rear of a ute, used to hold goods.
* A molded pulp tray is a disposable (or recyclable) tray provided by fast food restaurants, coffee shops and movie theaters. The tray is designed to hold four disposable cups.
* Surgical trays are used to carry surgical instruments, are rectangular and made of stainless steel to resist the heat of sterilization without corrosion.
* Seed trays are used for propagating vegetables and flowers and other plants from seed. They are also used for taking plant cuttings. The trays for seedling production are made of expanded polystyrene or polythene. They come in many sizes; the most common are the Danish and the European sized trays. Seed trays can also be stacked in seed tray racks to take up less space.
* A darkroom tray, also known as print developing tray, is used in photography.
* A dental impression tray is a receptacle or device that is used to carry impression material to the mouth, confine the material in apposition to the surfaces to be recorded, and control the impression material while it sets to form the impression.
* A baking tray or oven tray is used to cook a variety of foods in an oven, including vegetables and meats such as whole chickens. It allows food to be very exposed to the hot air inside the oven whilst preventing any fats of liquids from falling onto the oven floor. See also Sheet pan.
* Food packaging trays
** A foam tray is used by the supermarkets and by the fruit shops to package meat and small fruits, vegetables and mushrooms. Patents for this product exist since 1966.
** Aluminium foil take-out food tray used by the supermarkets for packaging processed food.
** Thin plastic trays used for both packaging shelf food and for take-out food
* A coin tray is used to store or collect coins. They are used in banks, restaurants, shops, casinos, and for coin collecting.

<doc id="268268" wikidata="Q445461" url="?curid=268268" title="Jakob Maria Mierscheid">
<text>Jakob Maria Mierscheid [[Member of Parliament|MdB]] has been a fictitious politician in the German Bundestag since 11 December 1979. He was the alleged deputy chairman of the &quot;&quot; (Committee for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses) of the Bundestag in 1981 and 1982. According to his official biography, he was born in Morbach/Hunsrück, a very rural constituency in Rhineland-Palatinate. He is Catholic and a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany.

The idea of Jakob Mierscheid was created on 11 December 1979 on the back of a menu in the restaurant of the Bundestag, when two members of parliament from the SPD, and , decided that their recently deceased colleague Carlo Schmid needed a worthy successor.
He is now a widely known curiosity within the Bundestag and uses Twitter as means of communication.

In 1983, the party magazine &quot;Vorwärts&quot; published an article purportedly written by Mierscheid claiming the discovery of a &quot;law&quot;, the Mierscheid Law, that indicated a strong correlation between the election results of the SPD in national elections and West &quot;German&quot; steel production. 
The Bundestag official web site carries an ostensibly serious &#x27;biography&#x27; and a photograph purporting to depict Mierscheid. In previous versions of the photograph, his fashion sense seemed very antiquated and his eyeglasses were added later. The current (2010) image shows a balding man sitting in a chair, facing away from the camera, in the middle of the empty Hall of Representatives. The German language version of the site lists 615 current names although the actual membership of the Bundestag is only 614, while the English and French language versions only list the actual membership of the Bundestag. Mierscheid has his own stationery and e-mail address and issues press releases now and then. The picture of Mierscheid at the Bundestag is based on the RTL Samstag Nacht character Karl Ranseier.

The hoax is paralleled in Germany in a number of other areas; for example, is a known (fictional) lawyer, and is a known (fictional) diplomat. Mierscheid, Nagelmann, and Dräcker each have a long list of publications which have sometimes really been published in otherwise reputable media (science journals, parliament press).

== Biography ==
The biography of Jakob Maria Mierscheid is that of a backbencher with a list of humble career steps. The official biography of the German parliament lists him as a member of the Trade Union of Peasants and Lumberjacks, member of the Sport Friends Club (treasurer 1977-1982), honorary member of the Choral Society of the Trade Union for Wood and Plastics Workers. First listed as official delegate to the Social Democrat Party congress in Hannover 1960, Mierscheid first visited the West German capital in 1967.

In 1967–68, he wrote a four-part series about the &quot;travel routes of the ring-tailed wood pigeons and its avionics&quot; in the Central Journal of the Carrier Pigeon Breeder Association, reprinted 1969 in the Swiss-confederate journal &quot;Homing Pigeon Correspondences&quot;. He entered the parliament in 1979. Following his time as deputy chairman of the &quot;&quot; (Committee for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses) of the Bundestag in 1981 and 1982, he wrote an article on the &quot;Mierscheid Law&quot; in the Social Democrats&#x27; journal &quot;Vorwärts&quot; published on 14 July 1983.

His activities continued with an article in &quot;Vorwärts&quot; titled &quot;The Solution: More market than corruption&quot; published on 12 January 1985, and in 1993 he authored &quot;Ecological data on the CFC replacement R134a&quot; for the third Höchst Stone Louse Symposium in Frankfurt.
There are some approved biography books like that of Peter Raabe: &quot;Die Mierscheid-Akte. Dokumentarische Spuren eines Phantoms&quot; (The Mierscheid File: Documentary Traces of a Phantom). Later Dietrich Sperling and Friedhelm Wollner published &quot;Jakob Mierscheid, Aus dem Leben eines Abgeordneten: Eine politische Holografie&quot; (Jakob Mierscheid, from the Life of a Member of Parliament: A Political Holography) in 1998.

On 11 December 2004, Mierscheid celebrated his 25th anniversary as member of the Bundestag. On 1 March 2013, the President of the German &quot;Bundestag,&quot; Mr. Norbert Lammert, said an official congratulation on occasion of Mierscheid&#x27;s 80th birthday. Mierscheid did not show up to a reception given in his honour in his home-town of Morbach.

In July 2005, the German &quot;Tagesschau&quot; announced the exit of Mierscheid from SPD to the German Linkspartei and WASG. Mierscheid&#x27;s angry dementi was announced both by the Tagesschau, and an interview in &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;.

After the parliament moved to Berlin, two new office buildings for members of parliament were connected with a pedestrian bridge over the Spree river. This bridge was nicknamed the &quot;Mierscheid Bridge&quot;. Attempts to mark it with an official plate were said to have failed because &quot;the nails were nuts&quot; (pun on &quot;Niete&quot; meaning nut/rivet, a blank in lottery or a person that is unable to accomplish anything).

After the historic defeat in the 2009 election, Mierscheid quoted Alfred, Lord Tennyson&#x27;s poem &quot;Ulysses&quot; in German to raise the spirits of his comrades in the Bundestag.

&lt;poem&gt;
Tho&#x27; much is taken, much abides; and tho&#x27;
We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Further appreciation ==
On Mierscheid’s 80th &quot;birthday&quot; in 2013, his alleged home town Morbach opened a hiking trail, a roundtrip of about 16 km (10 miles), providing humorous reflections on Mierscheid’s life and political activities on 14 information boards along the trail.

<doc id="268276" wikidata="Q1674139" url="?curid=268276" title="Ming Pao">
<text>Ming Pao () is a Chinese-language newspaper published by Media Chinese International in Hong Kong. In the 1990s, &quot;Ming Pao&quot; established four overseas branches in North America; each provides independent reporting on local news and collects local advertisements. Currently, of the overseas editions, only the two Canadian editions remain: &quot;Ming Pao Toronto&quot; and &quot;Ming Pao Vancouver&quot;. In a 2022 survey from the Chinese University of Hong Kong sampling 994 local households, &quot;Ming Pao&quot; was listed as the second most credible paid newspaper in Hong Kong.

==History==
=== Launch, early days ===

&quot;Ming Pao&quot; was first published on 20 May 1959, and was founded by the famous Chinese Wuxia novelist Louis Cha, known better by his pseudonym Jin Yong (金庸), and his friend, Shen Pao Sing (沈寶新).

Daisy Li Yuet-Wah won an International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for her work with the paper in 1994.

Before British Hong Kong&#x27;s handover to the People&#x27;s Republic of China by the United Kingdom in 1997, &quot;Ming Pao&quot; was considered hostile to the Chinese authority. When China reunited with Hong Kong, the controversial editors of &quot;Ming Pao&quot; turned favorable towards the Chinese government.

=== Merger with Malaysia Sinchew and Nanyang Groups ===

In October 1995, the publisher of &quot;Ming Pao&quot;, Ming Pao Enterprise was taken over by Tiong Hiew King (Chinese: 張曉卿). On 29 January 2007, Tiong released a proposal to merge the three media groups – Sin Chew Media Corporation Berhad (Malaysia), Nanyang Press Holdings Berhad (Malaysia) and Ming Pao Enterprise Corporation Limited (Hong Kong). The merged group, named Media Chinese International Limited was dual-listed on the main boards of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong and the Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad in April 2008. All of the existing groups retain their existing publications and independent operations.

The website of &quot;Ming Pao&quot; was set up in 1995, one of the earliest newspaper websites in Hong Kong.

Since April 2008, &quot;Ming Pao&quot; is published by Ming Pao Newspapers Limited, a subsidiary of Media Chinese International Limited.

== International development ==

&quot;Ming Pao&quot; set up a Toronto office in Canada in May 1993 to publish the Ming Pao Eastern Edition (), then set up a Vancouver office in October the same year for the Ming Pao Western Edition ().

In April 1997, the group set up a New York office and started publishing the Ming Pao US East Coast Edition (). The journal launched in the San Francisco Bay Area in April 2004 with a print run of 25,000, the sixth Chinese newspapers to be distributed in the region. In 2007, the office also published the &quot;New York Free Newspaper&quot; ().

&quot;Ming Pao New York&quot; and &quot;Ming Pao San Francisco&quot; ceased operations on 31 January and 14 February 2009, respectively. The closing of NY operations was a symbol of the weakening of ethnic newspapers of the region. The group merged the resources of &quot;Ming Pao New York&quot; and the &quot;New York Free Newspaper&quot; to create &quot;Ming Pao Daily Free News (New York)&quot; (), serving the Chinese community along the US East Coast.

== Controversies ==

=== Accusations of Chinese Communist Party influence ===

A 2001 report on Chinese media censorship by the Jamestown Foundation cited Ming Pao as one of the four major Chinese newspapers in the United States directly or indirectly controlled by Beijing. &quot;Employees at &quot;Ming Pao&quot;&#x27;s New York office have told sources that their &#x27;true boss&#x27; is none other than the Chinese Consulate [in New York], and that they are obligated to do whatever the Consulate asks,&quot; it said.

A 2006 study of &quot;Ming Pao&quot; editorials noted a tendency toward self-censorship concerning criticism toward Beijing. According to a 2013 report by the Center for International Media Assistance, this came after a number of newspapers, including &quot;Ming Pao Daily&quot;, were bought by business tycoons with interests in China and close ties to mainland officials before and after the handover of Hong Kong in 1997.

=== Assault on former chief editor Kevin Lau ===
Kevin Lau, who had been chief editor of the journal until January 2014, was attacked in the morning of 26 February 2014 in Sai Wan Ho, Hong Kong. He was seriously injured in a targeted knife attack. It was widely speculated that the attack may have been driven by political motivation, and related to its role in investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) into the offshore assets of China&#x27;s leaders, including relatives of Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping, former Premier Wen Jiabao, and several members of the National People&#x27;s Congress Journalists and press of the world saw the attack as an attack on press freedom. Thousands of people, led by leading journalists, attended a rally to denounce violence and intimidation of the media.

During the court hearings of the two suspects, one declared that he was looking to get a $100,000 reward with this attack.

=== Appointment of Chong Tien Siong ===

In 2014, the appointment of new chief editor Chong Tien Siong sparked controversy and internal revolt, due to Siong&#x27;s close ties to Beijing, and was seen as a major threat to the Chinese-language newspaper&#x27;s editorial independence.

=== Censorship of 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre ===

&quot;Ming Pao&quot; was subject to controversy in 2015 after editor-in-chief Chong Tien-siong ordered that a story detailing the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre be replaced with a story about Chinese Internet giant Alibaba as a &quot;role model for young, would-be entrepreneurs&quot;. Chum Shun-kin said the story that was pulled contained details about the history of the massacre, including eyewitness accounts of the killing of civilians and information from diplomatic cables from Canada. The pulling of the Tiananmen story has been criticised by some, including Civic Party lawmaker Claudia Mo who said that Chong appears to &quot;want to shield Beijing from embarrassment, instead of acting in the interests of the public and protecting their right to information&quot;.

Hong Kong Journalists Association spokeswoman Shum Yee-lan called on Chong to &quot;communicate&quot; with his own staff.

=== Termination of chief editor Keung Kwok-yuen ===
The journal&#x27;s executive chief editor, Keung Kwok-yuen (), was abruptly terminated on 20 April 2016, the same day that a report based on the Panama Papers was published on its front page. Management said that the paper&#x27;s turnover had been falling in since last year and the Keung had been laid off with immediate effect due to difficult operating conditions. The timing of Keung&#x27;s removal led to speculation that the Panama Papers report, which connected a number of influential individuals in the territory to tax havens abroad, may have been considered sensitive, thus being the real reason for the dismissal.

Keung had written several weeks earlier about the suppression of &quot;Ten Years&quot;, a dystopian film about Hong Kong in the year 2025 that was banned in mainland China. Staff and the union publicly denounced editor-in-chief Chong Tien Siong&#x27;s decision to &quot;punish editorial staff who have different opinions&quot;, and questioned the cost reduction pretext as an excuse. Journalists at &quot;Ming Pao&quot; manifested the concern felt by the media at large, several of them protested by filed blank space reports in an edition the Sunday following the dismissal.

===Editorials for 2019 anti-extradition bill protests===
On 13–14 June 2019, &quot;Ming Pao&quot; published editorials to define the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests as a riot (), blaming the violence of the protesters. However, on 14 June, the instant news section of &quot;mingpao.com&quot;, the web portal of the publisher, published a statement to declare that the editorial represents the newspaper, but not the frontier staff of the publisher. The translator of the editorial refused to translate the article to English as well as any editorials in the future in protest.

On 17 June 2019, &quot;Ming Pao&quot; published an open letter written by some of its employees criticizing the 13 June editorial for being biased towards the establishment and damaging the reputation of the newspaper.

<doc id="268279" wikidata="Q1162701" url="?curid=268279" title="Panathenaic Games">
<text>The Panathenaic Games () were held every four years in Athens in Ancient Greece from 566 BC to the 3rd century AD. These Games incorporated religious festival, ceremony (including prize-giving), athletic competitions, and cultural events hosted within a stadium.

==History==

The Panathenaic festival was formed in order to honor the goddess Athena who had become the patron of Athens after having a competition with the god Poseidon where they were to win the favor of the Athenian people by offering the people gifts. The festival would also bring unity among the people of Athens. 
The attempted assassination of the tyrants Hippias and Hipparchus during the Panathenaea in 514 BC by Harmodius and Aristogeiton was often regarded as the birth of Athenian democracy.

As the birthplace of Athena is Lake Tritonis in North Africa, Athenians did not contest North Africans to also participate in the Panathenaic games since they considered them to have a similar culture of that of Hellenists, one example of this is prince Mastanabal of Numidia the son of Masinissa, who won for Numidia 4 gold Medals in chariot racing.

== Events ==
The competitions for which the festival came to be known were part of the Great Panathenaia, a much larger religious occasion. These ritual observances consisted of numerous sacrifices to Athena (the namesake of the event and patron deity to the hosts of the event) as well as Poseidon and others. The Lesser Panathenaia, a sister-event to the Great Panathenaia, was held every year with 3 to 4 days shorter in celebration. The competitions were the most prestigious games for the citizens of Athens, but not as important as the Olympic Games or the other Panhellenic Games.

The Panathenaea also included poetic and musical competitions. Prizes were awarded for rhapsodic recitation of Homeric poetry, for instrumental music on the aulus and cithara, and for singing to the accompaniment of the aulus and cithara (citharody). In addition, the Games included a reading of epic poetry by early poets such as Homer, Pindar and Hesiod.

==The Panathenaic Stadium==

The athletic events were staged at the Panathenaic Stadium, which is still in use today. In 1865, Evangelis Zappas left a vast fortune in his will with instructions to excavate and refurbish the ancient Panathenaic stadium so that modern Olympic Games could be held every four years &quot;in the manner of our ancestors&quot;. The Panathenaic Stadium has hosted Zappas Olympics in 1870, and 1875, as well as the modern Olympic Games in 1896 and 2004. The stadium also hosted the 1906 Intercalated Games.

=== Contests ===
The Panathenaic Games held contests in a number of musical, athletic, and equestrian events. Due to the fact that there were so many contests held, the games usually lasted a little over a week. On a fourth century marble block, experts explain that on the block is written a program for the games, as well as individual events and their prizes. The inscription also says that there are two age categories for the music events but three age categories for the athletic events. According to scholars, the age groups are boys: 12–16; beardless youths: 16–20; men: over 20. One thing that was different about these games than normal funeral games is that prizes were given to runners-up, not just the lone victor.

Using the inscription, experts put together a general program like so:
* Day 1 - Musical and Rhapsodic Contest
* Day 2 - Athletic Contest for Boys and Youths
* Day 3 - Athletic Contest for Men
* Day 4 - Equestrian Contest
* Day 5 - Tribal Contest
* Day 6 - Torch Race and Sacrifice
* Day 7 - Boat Race
* Day 8 - Awarding of Prizes, Feasting and Celebrations
Experts reasonably came up with how the games went based on the order of prizes which were written on the marble block. Wrestling and discus were also included in the contest.

The musical events which took place were Kithara players, Flute players, and singers. The athletic events were the stadion, pentathlon, wrestling, boxing, and pankration. The equestrian events were two-horse chariot race, horse race, and javelin throw on horseback. Based on the inscription, we learn that the prizes given to the men and the youth were different. Men were rewarded a certain amount of drachmas and/or a valuable crown worth a certain amount of drachmas. Boys and youths were given a certain number of amphorae of olive oil.
=== Ceremony ===
The Panathenaic games were a chrematitic (&#x27;monetary&#x27;) event where the winner would take home prizes with a monetary value, as opposed to stephanitic (&#x27;crowned&#x27;) games like the Olympics which awarded the winner with only a crown. Award ceremonies included the giving of Panathenaic amphorae, which were large ceramic vessels containing olive oil given as a prize. The winner of the chariot race received as a prize one-hundred and forty Panathenaic amphorae full of olive oil.

==In mythology==
In the myth of the Minotaur, Minos&#x27; son Androgeus is killed during the Panathenaic Games. Some accounts, like Pseudo-Apollodorus&#x27;s &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, state he won and his jealous competitors ambushed and murdered him. Others, such as &quot;Graeciae Descriptio&quot; by Pausanias, say he was trampled to death by a mad bull.

<doc id="268284" wikidata="Q192936" url="?curid=268284" title="Nick Mason">
<text>Nicholas Berkeley Mason (born 27 January 1944) is an English drummer and a founder member of the progressive rock band Pink Floyd. He has been the only constant member since the band&#x27;s formation in 1965, and the only member to appear on every Pink Floyd album. He co-wrote Pink Floyd compositions including &quot;Echoes&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Careful with That Axe, Eugene&quot; and &quot;One of These Days&quot;.

In 1996, Mason was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Pink Floyd. In 2018, he formed a new band, Nick Mason&#x27;s Saucerful of Secrets, to perform music from Pink Floyd&#x27;s early years. Mason collects classic cars and competes in motorsport races, and has produced books and documentaries on the subject.

==Early life==
Mason was born on 27 January 1944 in Birmingham to Ailsa Sarah (née Kershaw) and Bill Mason, a documentary filmmaker; one of his paternal great-grandfathers was Rowland Hill Berkeley, who was Lord Mayor of Birmingham in 1904–1905.

Mason was brought up in Hampstead, London, and attended the Hall School, Hampstead, and Frensham Heights School, near Farnham, Surrey. While studying architecture at the Regent Street Polytechnic (now the University of Westminster), he formed a band, Sigma 6, an early incarnation of Pink Floyd, with Roger Waters, Bob Klose and Richard Wright in 1964. In September 1963, Waters and Mason moved into a flat near Crouch End in London, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the nearby Hornsey College of Art and the Regent Street Polytechnic. Mason moved out after the 1964 academic year.

==Pink Floyd==
Pink Floyd released their debut album, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;, in 1967. Mason has played on every Pink Floyd album since. The only Pink Floyd compositions credited solely to Mason are &quot;The Grand Vizier&#x27;s Garden Party&quot; (from &quot;Ummagumma&quot;) and &quot;Speak to Me&quot; (from &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;). The track &quot;Nick&#x27;s Boogie&quot; was named after him.

The only occasions on which Mason&#x27;s voice has been included on Pink Floyd&#x27;s albums are &quot;Corporal Clegg&quot;; the single spoken line in &quot;One of These Days&quot;; and spoken parts of &quot;Signs of Life&quot; and &quot;Learning to Fly&quot; (the latter taken from an actual recording of Mason&#x27;s first solo flight) from &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot;. He does, however, sing lead vocals on two unreleased but heavily bootlegged tracks, &quot;Scream Thy Last Scream&quot; (1967), penned by original group leader Syd Barrett, and &quot;The Merry Xmas Song&quot; (1975–76). In live performances of the song &quot;Sheep&quot;, Mason delivered the spoken section.

Despite legal conflicts over ownership of the name &quot;Pink Floyd&quot;, which began when Waters left the group in 1985 and lasted roughly seven years, Waters and Mason are reportedly on good terms. Mason joined Waters on the last two nights of his 2002 world tour to play drums on the Pink Floyd song &quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot;, and he also played drums on some concerts of Waters&#x27; European tour in 2006, and during performances in Los Angeles and New York City in the United States.

In July 2005, Mason, Gilmour, Wright, and Waters played together on stage for the first time in 24 years at the Live 8 concert in London. Mason joined Gilmour and Wright again for the encore during Gilmour&#x27;s show at the Royal Albert Hall, London, on 31 May 2006. He also stated in 2006 that Pink Floyd had not officially disbanded, but with the death of Wright in 2008, the band effectively came to an end, as confirmed by Gilmour. While Gilmour and Waters continued to quarrel, Mason remained close to both.

On 12 May 2007, Mason joined Waters on stage at Earls Court to play &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. On 12 May 2011, Mason was featured (along with Gilmour) on the encore &quot;Outside the Wall&quot; at a concert by Waters, who was performing &quot;The Wall&quot; in its entirety (Gilmour also performed on &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; that night). Mason worked with musicians including Steve Hillage (as drummer and producer), Robert Wyatt (with whom he appeared on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;), the Damned and Gong. He also drummed for Michael Mantler. 

Mason&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd&quot;, was published in the UK in October 2004. It is also available, abridged, as a 3-CD audio book, read by Mason. An updated edition was published in paperback in 2011.

Mason performed in the closing ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games on 12 August 2012. He produced and played on the charity single &quot;Save the Children (Look Into Your Heart)&quot;, which also featured Beverley Knight, Mick Jagger and Ronnie Wood and which was released in May 2015 in aid of Save the Children&#x27;s Nepal Earthquake Appeal. On 17 October 2012, Mason was presented with a BASCA Gold Badge Award in recognition of his contributions to music. Mason said in 2018 that, while he remained close to Gilmour and Waters, the two remained &quot;at loggerheads&quot;.

===Nick Mason&#x27;s Saucerful of Secrets===

In 2018, Mason formed a new band, Nick Mason&#x27;s Saucerful of Secrets, to perform Pink Floyd&#x27;s early psychedelic material. Along with Mason, the band comprises former Blockheads guitarist Lee Harris, bassist and Pink Floyd collaborator Guy Pratt, vocalist and guitarist Gary Kemp of Spandau Ballet, and Orb keyboardist Dom Beken. As many fans had discovered Pink Floyd with &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, Mason wanted to bring their earlier material to a wider audience. The band toured Europe and North America in 2018 and 2019, with a third tour postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2020, they released a live album and film, &quot;Live at the Roundhouse&quot;.

==Drumming style==

Influenced by jazz and big band music, Mason embraced acoustic drums (both single- and double-headed), tuned percussion, electronic drums and Rototoms, melding all of these into a melodic whole. His snare drum sound shifted from harsh demarcation of beats 2 and 4 (&quot;Careful with that Axe, Eugene&quot;) to a fatter and gentler timbre (&quot;Echoes&quot;) — a change that reflected growing studio skills.

Mason&#x27;s style was gentler and more laid back than that of other progressive rock drummers of the time. He soloed on a few Pink Floyd compositions including &quot;Nick&#x27;s Boogie&quot;, &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot;, &quot;The Grand Vizier&#x27;s Garden Party&quot;, &quot;Up The Khyber&quot;, &quot;Skins&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot;. Due to the dynamic live performances of Pink Floyd, Mason&#x27;s style was more energetic and complex live, and can be heard on such albums as &quot;Ummagumma&quot; and &quot;Live at Pompeii&quot;.

Mason began using Premier drums but changed to Ludwig drums after seeing Ginger Baker use them. He also briefly used Fibes Drums. He currently uses Drum Workshop (DW) drums, pedals and hardware. His kit is a DW double bass kit with the &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; logo on the drums. He has also used Paiste cymbals during his entire career with Pink Floyd and currently uses a mixture of Paiste Traditional, Signature and 2002 cymbals. He also endorses Remo drumheads, Latin Percussion and Pro-Mark sticks.

==Cars and motor racing==

As Pink Floyd&#x27;s recording and touring schedule grew more sporadic, Mason had more time to pursue his favourite hobby, motor racing. This interest was documented in the 1986 short film &quot;Life Could Be a Dream&quot;. He owns (through his company Ten Tenths) and races several classic cars, and has competed at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. His racing cars include: 

* Alfa Romeo 8C
* Bentley 4½ Litre (his father&#x27;s racing car) 
* BRM P30 (which he previously raced)
* Bugatti Type 35 
* Jaguar D-Type; 
* Ferrari 250 LM 
* Ferrari BB LM 
* Maserati Tipo 61
* McLaren F1 GTR 

In 1998, Mason published a book, &quot;Into the Red&quot;, in which he documents his experience with his cars, along with some histories. It was followed in 2010 by a second book, &quot;Passion for Speed: Twenty-four Classic Cars that Shaped a Century of Motor Sport&quot;.

Mason is associated with the Italian manufacturer Ferrari, and estimates he has owned 40 Ferrari cars. His first purchase in the early 1970s was a Ferrari 275 GTB/4, which he comments would regularly wet-plug (when spark plugs are coated with unburned fuel). His most notable purchase was in 1977 from his proceeds from the sale of the Pink Floyd album &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot;, when he paid £37,000 () for one of only 39 Ferrari 250 GTOs. He still owns the car, valued now in excess of £30 million. Mason and Gilmour drove the first two Ferrari F40s back to the UK from Maranello.

Mason was invited by Ferrari to purchase one of the 399 original Enzo cars. He appeared in an episode of the BBC motoring programme &quot;Top Gear&quot; in which he allowed Jeremy Clarkson to borrow it for a review, on the condition Clarkson promote the release of the book &quot;Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd&quot;. Skirting BBC advertising rules prohibiting product endorsements, Clarkson referenced Pink Floyd songs and album titles in the review of the Enzo and the Stig drove around the Top Gear test track with &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot; playing, despite the fact that the Enzo does not come equipped with a stereo. Mason later sold the Enzo, and replaced it with a Blu Scozia-coloured LaFerrari.

Mason appeared on Season 2, Episode 8 of &quot;The Grand Tour&quot;. He won against the Police drummer Stewart Copeland for the title of &quot;fastest rock drummer from a band that begins with a P&quot; (driving not drumming) in the Celebrity Face Off segment.

==Personal life==
Mason&#x27;s first marriage was to Lindy Rutter in 1969, with whom he had two daughters, Holly and Chloe. During this time, she contributed uncredited tin whistle and flute parts to two Pink Floyd albums, &quot;More&quot; and &quot;Ummagumma&quot;. The couple divorced in 1988, and in 1990, Mason married Annette (Nettie) Lynton, an actress. They live in Hampstead, London with their two sons, Cary and Guy. Since 1995, the family has also owned Middlewick House, the Grade II listed former home of Andrew and Camilla Parker Bowles, just outside the Wiltshire town of Corsham.

Mason is an atheist. His wealth amounted to £75 million, according to the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; 2015–2016. In addition to vintage car collecting, Mason is a qualified helicopter pilot, and flies an Aerospatiale AS 350 Squirrel helicopter in specially painted colours.

Mason is part of Football Ventures, a consortium that bought Bolton Wanderers Football Club out of administration in August 2019. He is a supporter of Arsenal F.C.

In December 2021, Mason&#x27;s portrait was painted by semi-finalists on an episode of &quot;Portrait Artist of the Year&quot;.

===Views and advocacy===
In common with Roger Waters, Mason has played concerts to raise funds for the Countryside Alliance, a group which campaigned against the ban on fox hunting with the Hunting Act 2004. In 2007 they both performed at Highclere Castle in Hampshire in support of the group.

He is a board member and co-chairman of the Featured Artists&#x27; Coalition. As a spokesman for the organisation, Mason has voiced his support for musicians&#x27; rights and offered advice to younger artists in a rapidly changing music industry.

In 2014, Mason joined Waters in expressing support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign against Israel over the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and urged the Rolling Stones not to play in Israel.

In November of that year, Mason designed a &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;-themed Paddington Bear statue, exhibited outside the O2 Arena in London (one of 50 placed around the city). The statues were auctioned to raise funds for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).

Nick and Annette Mason have been supporters of Wiltshire and Bath Air Ambulance Charity for many years, including opening the gardens of their home, Middlewick House, to raise money for the charity.

==Honours and awards==
On 26 November 2012, Mason received the Honorary title of Doctor of Letters from the University of Westminster at the presentation ceremony of the School of Architecture and Built Environment (he had studied architecture at the university&#x27;s predecessor, Regent Street Polytechnic, 1962–1967).

Mason was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2019 New Year Honours, &quot;for services to music&quot;, and was presented with the award by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge at Buckingham Palace on 2 May 2019.

On 24 July 2023, ahead of his Pompeii concert with his current band, Nick Mason’s Saucerful of Secrets, Mason was awarded with the honorary citizenship of the Italian city of Pompeii.

<text>Ephraim Kishon (: August 23, 1924 – January 29, 2005) was a Hungarian-born Israeli author, dramatist, screenwriter, and Oscar-nominated film director. He was one of the most widely read contemporary satirists in Israel, and was also particularly popular in German-speaking countries.

== Biography ==
Ephraim Kishon was born on August 23, 1924, by the name of Ferenc Hoffmann into a middle-class Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary. In his youth he knew neither Hebrew nor Yiddish. His father worked as a bank manager and his mother was a former secretary. Kishon also had a sister who was a writer.

His writing talent became evident in his youth. In 1940 he won his first prize for writing a novel for high school students. Due to the racial laws applied in Hungary during World War II, he was not allowed to continue his studies at the university and therefore he began to study jewelry making in 1942.

During World War II the Nazis imprisoned him in several concentration camps. At one camp his chess talent helped him survive, as he played chess with the guards. In another camp, the Germans lined up the inmates and shot every tenth person, but passed him by. He later wrote in his book &quot;The Scapegoat&quot;, &quot;They made a mistake—they left one satirist alive&quot;. He eventually managed to escape the concentration camps while being transported to the Sobibor extermination camp in Nazi German Occupied Poland, and hid the remainder of the war disguised as &quot;Stanko Andras&quot;, a Slovak laborer.

After the war when he returned to Budapest he discovered that his parents and sister had survived, but many other family members had been murdered in the gas chambers at Auschwitz. In 1945, he changed his surname from Hoffmann to Kishont and returned to Hungary, where he continued to study art and writing. In 1948 he completed his studies in metal sculpturing and art history and began publishing humorous articles under the name Franz Kishunt.

In 1949 he immigrated to the newly founded state of Israel, together with his first wife Eva (Chawa) Klamer, to escape the Communist regime. When arriving in Israel an immigration officer officially his name to &quot;Ephraim Kishon&quot;. According to Kishon, the Jewish Agency clerk asked him for his name and when he answered &quot;Ferenc&quot; the clerk said: There is no such thing, and wrote &quot;Ephraim&quot;, and afterwards he went ahead and Hebraicized his family name as well, Kishon being a river near Haifa, the Israeli city on Mount Carmel.

His first marriage to Eva (Chawa) Klamer in 1946 ended in divorce. In 1959, he married Sara (&quot;née&quot; Lipovitz), who died in 2002. In 2003, he married the Austrian writer Lisa Witasek. Kishon had three children: Raphael (b. 1957), Amir (b. 1963), and Renana (b. 1968).

In 1981, Kishon established a second home in the rural Swiss canton of Appenzell as he felt unwelcome in Israel due to his status as an immigrant.
Being a popular Israeli writer, he still felt he was getting negative treatment from the Israeli media due to the fact he was rather right wing in his political views.

Kishon died on January 29, 2005, at his home in Switzerland at the age of 80 following a cardiac arrest. His body was flown to Israel and he was buried at the Trumpeldor Cemetery in Tel Aviv.

== Literary career==
Kishon initially lived in the &quot;Sha&#x27;ar Ha&#x27;Aliyah&quot; transit camp near Haifa, and soon afterwards moved to Kibbutz Kfar Hahoresh, in which he worked as a nurse while learning the Hebrew language during his free time with the help of his neighbor Joseph Bilitzer. During this period he wrote several humorous lists for the Hungarian newspaper &quot;Új Kelet&quot;. Afterwards Kishon moved to a housing project. He studied Hebrew at the Ulpan &quot;Etzion&quot; in Jerusalem, and soon became proficient in the language. Nevertheless, his heavy Hungarian accent accompanied him throughout his life.

Mastering the Hebrew language with remarkable speed, in 1951 Kishon began writing a satirical column in the easy-Hebrew daily, &quot;Omer&quot;, after only two years in the country. Later on Kishon began writing for the newspaper &quot;Davar&quot; (which was very influential at the time) in which he published a satire called &quot;The Blaumilch Canal&quot;. That same year he published his first book in Israel &quot;Ha-ole Ha-Yored le-Chayenu&quot;- &quot;The Pestering Immigrant&quot;, (a pun on the Hebrew word for &quot;Immigrant&quot;) which was written in Hungarian and translated into Hebrew by Avigdor Hameiri. The book was mostly about the life experiences of new immigrants in Israel during the 1950s.

In 1952 Kishon began writing a regular satirical column called &quot;Had Gadya&quot; (&quot;One Young Goat&quot; in Aramaic, taken from the Passover Seder liturgy) in the daily Hebrew tabloid &quot;Ma&#x27;ariv&quot;. Kishon kept writing the column for about 30 years, while in the first two decades he published a new column almost every day. Within a few years after launching his writing career in Israel Kishon became one of the most prominent humorists and satirists in the country.

Kishon&#x27;s extraordinary linguistic inventiveness and flair for creating characters was carried over into his work for the theater. Collections of his humorous writings have appeared in Hebrew and in translation. Among the English translations are &quot;Look Back Mrs. Lot&quot; (1960), &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark, Tourist Class&quot; (1962), &quot;The Seasick Whale&quot; (1965), and two books on the Six-Day War and its aftermath, &quot;So Sorry We Won&quot; (1967), and &quot;Woe to the Victors&quot; (1969). Two collections of his plays have also appeared in Hebrew: &quot;Shemo Holekh Lefanav&quot; (1953) and &quot;Ma´arkhonim&quot; (1959).

Kishon&#x27;s books have been translated into 37 languages and sold particularly well in Germany. Kishon rejected the idea of universal guilt for the Holocaust. He said: “It gives me great satisfaction to see the grandchildren of my executioners queuing up to buy my books.” Until his death in 1979, Friedrich Torberg translated his work into German. Thereafter Kishon did the German translations himself.

== Chess ==

Kishon was a lifelong chess enthusiast, and took an early interest in chess-playing computers. In 1990, German chess computer manufacturer Hegener &amp; Glaser together with Fidelity produced the &quot;Kishon Chesster&quot;, a chess computer distinguished by the spoken comments it would make during a game. Kishon wrote the comments to be humorous, but were also carefully chosen to be relevant to chess and the position in the game.

===Films===
Kishon expanded into cinema in the early 1960s. He wrote, directed and produced five feature films, all of them comedic /satirical movies. Three movies were nominated for major international awards including the Golden Globe award (two wins) and the Oscar (two nominations):
* &quot;Sallah Shabati&quot; (1964), nominated for Oscar for best foreign language film), Israeli comedy film about the chaos of Israeli immigration and resettlement which was critical of the treatment immigrants to Israel received depicting immigrants being vilified by Ashkenazi Israelis. This social satire placed the director Ephraim Kishon among the first Israeli filmmakers to achieve international success. It also introduced actor Chaim Topol (&quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;) to audiences worldwide.
* &quot;Ervinka&quot; (1967), written and directed by Kishon. The film, starring Topol, is a comical tale of a con man who falls in love with a police officer.
* &quot;Blaumilch Canal&quot;, also known as &quot;The Big Dig&quot; (1969, nominated for Golden Globe 1971), an Israeli comedy which depicts the madness of bureaucracy through a municipality&#x27;s reaction to the actions of a lunatic.
* &quot;The Policeman&quot;, original Hebrew title &quot;Ha-Shoter Azoulay&quot; (literally, &quot;Constable Azoulay&quot;) (1971, nominated for Oscar for best foreign language film, awarded 1972 Golden Globe for best foreign language film). It won several other awards, such as best foreign film in the Barcelona film festival and best director in the Monte Carlo festival. In Israel it is considered a cinematic classic.
* &quot;The Fox in the Chicken Coop&quot; (1978), based on Kishon&#x27;s satirical book by the same name (Hebrew: Ha Shu&#x27;al B&#x27;Lool HaTarnegolot), features many prominent Israeli actors of the time, most notably Shaike Ophir and Seffy Rivlin. The film takes a satirical, comic look at the old generation of Israeli politicians.

==Awards==
* 1953, Nordau Prize for Literature
* 1958, Sokolov Prize for Journalism
* 1964, Kinor David (David&#x27;s Harp) Prize
* 1970, Herzl Award for Hungarian Jewry: for literature
* 1998, co-recipient (jointly with Nurit Guvrin and Aryeh Sivan) of the Bialik Prize for Hebrew literature
* 2002, Israel Prize for lifetime achievement &amp; special contribution to society and the State of Israel Upon receiving the prize, he remarked: &quot;I&#x27;ve won the Israel Prize, even though I&#x27;m pro-Israel. It&#x27;s almost like a state pardon. They usually give it to one of those liberals who love the Palestinians and hate the settlers.&quot;

Kishon was nominated twice for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and three times for a Golden Globe Award. He won two Golden Globe Best Foreign Language Film Awards, for &quot;Sallah Shabati&quot; (1964), and &quot;The Policeman&quot; (1971).

<text>Corpus Christi College (full name: &quot;The College of Corpus Christi and the Blessed Virgin Mary&quot;, often shortened to &quot;Corpus&quot;) is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge. From the late 14th century to the early 19th century it was also commonly known as St Benet&#x27;s College.

The college is notable as the only one founded by Cambridge townspeople: it was established in 1352 by the Guild of Corpus Christi and the Guild of the Blessed Virgin Mary, making it the sixth-oldest college in Cambridge. With around 300 undergraduates and 200 postgraduates, it also has the second smallest student body of the traditional colleges of the university, after Peterhouse.

The College has traditionally been one of the more academically successful colleges in the University of Cambridge. In the unofficial Tompkins Table, which ranks the colleges by the class of degrees obtained by their undergraduates, in 2012 Corpus was in third position, with 32.4% of its undergraduates achieving first-class degrees. The college&#x27;s average position between 2003 and 2012 was 9th, and in the 2022 rankings it was placed 9th.

Corpus ranks among the wealthiest Cambridge colleges in terms of fixed assets, being exceptionally rich in silver.
The College&#x27;s endowment was valued at £99.7 million at the end of June 2023, while its net assets were valued at £239 million.

== History ==
=== Foundation ===
The guild of Corpus Christi was founded in Cambridge in 1349 by William Horwode, Henry de Tangmere, and John Hardy in response to the Black Death. They determined to found a new college in the University of Cambridge, the sixth in the University&#x27;s history. Later the same year the new guild merged with an older guild, the Guild of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which had been decimated by the Plague. The united guilds acquired land in the centre of town and their patron, the Duke of Lancaster, applied to King Edward III for a licence to found a new college, which was granted in 1352.

Construction of a single modest court near the parish church began immediately and in 1356 it was ready to house the Master and two fellows. The college&#x27;s statutes were drawn up in 1356. The united guild merged its identity with the new college, which acquired all the guild&#x27;s lands, ceremonies, and revenues. The grandest of these ceremonies was the annual Corpus Christi procession: a parade through the streets to Magdalene Bridge, the host carried by a priest and several of the college&#x27;s treasures carried by the Master and fellows, before returning for an extravagant dinner. The parade continued until the English Reformation, when the Master, William Sowode, put a stop to it in 1535. The college continues to have a grand dinner on the feast day of Corpus Christi, the Thursday after Trinity Sunday.

The newly constructed court could house 22 fellows and students. The statutes laid down the rules governing the behaviour of fellows only. Students were not part of the foundation at this stage and would not come within the scope of the statutes for another 200 years.

===Name===
The college&#x27;s most formal name is the College of Corpus Christi and the Blessed Virgin Mary in the University of Cambridge, usually abbreviated to Corpus Christi College. From the early 16th century, it was also known as Benet or St Benet&#x27;s College, from the nearby St Bene&#x27;t&#x27;s Church, associated with the founding guild of Corpus Christi. Both the college and the church stand on Bene&#x27;t Street. Until the late 16th century, the church served as the college chapel, although St Botolph&#x27;s was also used for some services. When Thomas Cosyn was master of the college in the late 15th century, a gallery was built which linked the college to St Benet&#x27;s church.

By the later 16th century, Benet College became the name most commonly used, as &quot;Corpus Christi&quot; was deemed to have a very Roman Catholic flavour. This preference continued until the early 19th century.

=== Medieval period ===
In its early centuries, the college was relatively poor and so could not construct new buildings; thus Old Court has survived to the present day. It had no chapel, so the members worshipped in St Bene&#x27;t&#x27;s Church next door. From the late 14th century through to the 19th century, particularly during the Reformation when Catholic references were discouraged, Corpus was known as St Benet&#x27;s College. By 1376 it possessed 55 books, and many more would be donated or bequeathed over the succeeding centuries, including, those bequeathed by Thomas Markaunt and, most significantly, those donated in the 16th century by Archbishop Matthew Parker, who is celebrated by the college as its greatest benefactor.

During the Peasants&#x27; Revolt in 1381, the college was sacked by a mob of townspeople (and apparently some students) led by the mayor which, according to the college, carried away its plate as well as its charter to be burned while gutting the rest of the college buildings. Corpus was the only University college, although by no means the only University building, to be attacked. The revolt, which ironically took place during the Corpus Christi week, focused on the college as centre of discontent due to its rigid collection of &quot;candle rents&quot;. The college claimed £80 (roughly £50,000 in modern terms) in damages.

In 1460 during the Wars of the Roses, the college paid for armaments including artillery and arrows, and protective clothing to defend the college&#x27;s treasures from a &quot;tempestuous riot&quot;.

Elizabeth, Duchess of Norfolk, and her sister Lady Eleanor Botelar née Talbot, who is believed by some to have been secretly married to Edward IV, endowed the college with scholarships in the 1460s and financed repairs to the college buildings. As a monument a &#x27;talbot&#x27;, the heraldic supporter of the Talbot family, was placed on the gable of Old Court and can still be seen today. At the same time the Master, Thomas Cosyn, built the college&#x27;s first chapel and a passageway between Old Court and St Bene&#x27;t&#x27;s Church. Over the next few centuries, garret rooms were added in Old Court increasing student numbers.

=== Reformation ===
Although spared the worst of the religious tumult that the Reformation brought to England, the college produced adherents and indeed martyrs to both traditions. Notable are William Sowode who cancelled the Corpus Christi procession, St Richard Reynolds who was martyred by Henry VIII, and Thomas Dusgate and George Wishart who were both burned as Protestants. 

It was during this time that Matthew Parker became Master. He donated his unrivalled library to the college, much silver plate and its symbol, the pelican. In order to ensure the safety of his collection Parker inserted into the terms of his endowment one which stated that if any more than a certain number of books were lost, the rest of the collection would pass first to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge and then (in the event of any more losses) to Trinity Hall, Cambridge. Every few years, representatives from both of those colleges ceremonially inspect the collection for any losses.

Parker placed a similar condition on the silver that he bequeathed to the college and these stipulations are part of the reason why Corpus Christi College retains to this day the entirety of the library and the silver collection: they were unable to sell off (or melt down) the less valuable parts of either collection without losing both. (Parker&#x27;s assiduousness in his acquisition of books and manuscripts has been suggested as an origin of the phrase &quot;Nosey Parker&quot;.) Parker was forced to resign as Master in 1553 by the accession of Mary I but was elected Archbishop of Canterbury upon the succession of Elizabeth I.

The playwright Christopher Marlowe is perhaps the college&#x27;s most-celebrated son, having matriculated to Corpus in 1580. Although little is known about his time there, it is often believed that it was during his study for his MA that he began his work as a spy, a claim based on only a single cryptic statement by the Privy Council. 

In 1952, a portrait of a man &quot;in the 21st year of his age&quot; was discovered during renovation work at the college. As the painting is dated 1585, the year Marlowe was 21, it has been claimed as a portrait of the playwright, of whom no other known portrait exists.

As the number of students rose a bigger chapel became necessary. In 1578 Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, who had already endowed several scholarships to the college, donated £200 (roughly £30,000 now) for the construction of a new chapel. This sum was not nearly great enough to build a chapel, and despite the efforts of the Master and fellows, the project outran estimates and nearly bankrupted the college. The college sold all of its silver, apart from the gifts from Parker, and the building work was not completed until 1662. Other contributors included Elizabeth I and Sir Francis Drake.

Owing to disputed appointments to the Mastership, Elizabeth I imposed the appointment of John Jegon as Master in 1590. The college did not appoint its own master for some time. Although not the college&#x27;s choice, Jegon extricated the college from its financial difficulties by instituting &quot;fellow commoners&quot;, who would stay for one or two years and were never technically members of the university. Their parents were required to pay with a silver cup or tankard, which would then be melted down. The next notable master was Henry Butts, who was also vice chancellor of the university. When the plague returned to the city and the rest of the university had fled, Butts stayed at his post and tried to limit the pestilence while staying alone in the college. He was unrewarded for his bravery and this experience seems to have had a terrible effect on him. In 1632, when Butts failed to turn up to deliver the University Sermon on Easter Day, he was found to have hanged himself.

=== Jacobean period ===
Corpus maintains an impressive collection of silver as it was the only college not to sell its silverware in support of either side during the Civil War. That, and its unrivalled collection of manuscripts and massive collection of rare wines and ports, fuels rumours that it is Cambridge&#x27;s richest college per student. This is a moot point, since these assets cannot be sold and the majority of them cannot be valued.

Unlike other Oxbridge colleges, the college managed to remain neutral during the Civil War. This was due to the ministration of Richard Love who was Master throughout the Civil War and the Commonwealth. According to college legend, the silver plate was distributed to the fellows to keep it from being requisitioned by the warring factions. When the fighting finished the plate was returned and melted down to pay for repairs. Twelve college heads were removed from their posts, but Love and three others were retained. The college also escaped the worst excesses of the puritan Commonwealth. When William Dowsing inspected the college he found &quot;nothing to amend&quot;. St Benet&#x27;s Church was not so lucky and indeed there was much disturbance in the fellowship as many were forced out and reinstated as circumstances changed through the period.

=== Age of Enlightenment ===

In 1688, the college was attacked once again by a mob, this time with an anti-Catholic bent. They made for the rooms of the bursar, Clement Scott, whom they suspected of popery. He hid himself from the mob so they destroyed his books and papers. The college continued to grow throughout the 18th century and did produce several distinguished scholars and clergymen including the so-called Benedictine Antiquaries, a dozen or so men all well known for antiquarian research including such figures as Richard Gough and William Stukeley.

In the 1740s, Archbishop Thomas Herring left £1000 for the rebuilding of the college and this led to several abortive attempts to start construction. In 1770 Matthias Mawson, former Master and Bishop of Ely, bequeathed £3000 to defray the costs of demolishing and rebuilding the college but this was not enough. It was not until 1822 when £55,000 had accrued in the rebuilding fund that efforts started. William Wilkins, who had recently completed major works at Downing, King&#x27;s, and Trinity, was appointed architect and the New Court was completed in 1827 in a neo-Gothic style. This involved the demolition of several buildings, including the Elizabethan chapel. The chapel currently standing in New Court is part of the 19th-century construction. Completion of a new, larger court allowed for many more students and numbers increased from 48 to 100.

=== Victorian Period ===
During the 19th century the college became associated with the Evangelical religious movement. In the 1860s its popularity grew so great that it became the third largest college in Cambridge. Corpus was always strongly clerical as, at the time, all the fellows had to be in Holy Orders of the Church of England. For many years the majority of the college&#x27;s graduates went on to be clergymen. However, the university was changing quickly; with the repeal of the Test Acts and Catholic emancipation allowing Catholics to join the university for the first time. The syllabus also broadened and the fellow commoners faded away. In 1882, fellows were allowed to marry for the first time. This meant that being an academic fellow could be a lifelong career rather than a stop gap between study and becoming a country parson. Consequently, the demographics of the college fellowship changed significantly during this time. The first married fellow was Edward Byles Cowell who was the first professor of Sanskrit. Later in the century the college fell on hard times and the number of undergraduates dropped to fewer than 50. It was around this time that the infamous &#x27;Chess Club&#x27; was founded. Despite their impeccant name they became notorious for hard drinking and partying. They were outlawed in the 1980s for their activities.

=== Edwardian period ===
Colonel Robert Caldwell was made Master in 1906 and was the first ever layman to be appointed to the post. He changed the policy of the college with regard to admittance of fellows and undergraduates, encouraging men from other colleges and outside Cambridge to become fellows. The college was no longer chiefly training men for the clergy. Student numbers increased significantly and a new undergraduate Library named after one of the Burgesses for the university, Geoffrey Butler was completed. The college also began construction of its sports grounds in west Cambridge in 1939.

=== Second World War===

During the Second World War, the Master of the College was Sir Will Spens, who was also Regional Commissioner of Civil Defence for the Eastern Region: had Hitler invaded, he would have been in charge of running Eastern England. The college housed various government departments whilst the then Master was also the Regional Commissioner. Corpus would have hosted the organisation which may have been required to act as an autonomous government authority if central government was incapacitated. This has led to a persistent rumour of a network of tunnels under the college excavated for this purpose. While there are extensive wine cellars, there is no evidence of such tunnels. During the war there were fewer undergraduates in residence, but the space was taken up by cadets and officers of the armed services taking short courses. Due to the increase in student numbers in the 1930s, Corpus is one of the few British institutions to have lost more members in the Second World War than in the First. Their names are inscribed in the Chapel.

Corpus owns The Eagle Pub, which is managed by Greene King. Watson and Crick are said to have refreshed themselves in this pub while studying the structure of DNA in the nearby Cavendish Laboratory. Upon making the discovery in 1952, they are said to have walked into the pub and declared, &quot;We have found the secret of life&quot;. A blue plaque on the front of the pub commemorates the event. The Eagle is also well known as a haunt for RAF officers in World War Two; renovations revealed hundreds of signatures, drawings and messages written, or even burnt, onto the walls and ceilings.

=== Modern period ===
During the 1960s, central heating was extended across the entire college campus. Women were also allowed to join the college Chapel Choir and dine in hall. In 1963, the college&#x27;s first bar was opened in New Court. In 2008, it was moved to Library Court and the old bar was converted into a post room, staffroom and a graduate student common room.

In 1962, the college approved the conversion of the Leckhampton site to allow for more accommodation for fellows and postgraduate students. Further properties were purchased adjacent to the site and a new building, the George Thomson building, named in honour of a former Master, was completed in 1964.

In 1983, women were first admitted as undergraduates. They had been able to become research students and Fellows for a few years before this. In the same year, the college completed building work in Botolph Court, adding further undergraduate accommodation. Similar renovation work was completed in Bene&#x27;t Court above the Eagle pub in the 1990s along with the creation of the Robert Beldam building.

In recent years, the College has spearheaded the Northern Ireland Initiative. It also has strong links with New Zealand, taking a student on a full scholarship from the country each year, paid for by the Worshipful Company of Girdlers. A former president is the historian and Cold War scholar Christopher Andrew. He also chairs the &#x27;Cambridge Intelligence Seminar&#x27; which convenes regularly in rooms.

The current college visitor is the Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, Lord Sainsbury of Turville.

In 2008, the college completed the renovation of an adjacent bank building and other college buildings to create Library Court, the third court within the main college campus.

In January 2012, several pieces of silver worth a total of £11,596 were stolen from the college collection. The items, which included chalices and patens, were taken from the college chapel while it was open to the public. Several pieces worth £956 in total were recovered a fortnight later; the remainder was discovered to have been melted down. A local man was arrested and charged with the theft. None of the pieces lost were part of Parker&#x27;s bequest.

On 12 July 2017, the Fellowship of the College elected professor Christopher Kelly, president of the college and former senior tutor, as the college&#x27;s 52nd master. He took up his post in the Michaelmas Term of 2018.

A major restoration of the college&#x27;s dining hall and servery were undertaken in 2017–18 and completed in February 2019, revealing medieval stonework that had been covered up by the previous restoration in the 1950s.

In July 2019, the college announced that it would create 30 new undergraduate places, specifically aimed at helping students from under-represented backgrounds to take up places at the university.

== Buildings ==
=== Old Court ===
Built in the 1350s, Old Court contains some of Cambridge&#x27;s oldest buildings, and retains many of its original features, such as sills and jambs used to hold oil-soaked linen in the days prior to the arrival of glass. The court is the oldest continually inhabited courtyard in the country (a claim disputed by Merton College, Oxford, which says the same of its Mob Quad). It is possibly built from the core of an even older building. Four sided, it typifies the model of construction of the colleges in Oxford or Cambridge. A passageway connects Old Court to Bene&#x27;t Street. Due to its age the rooms are large and contain antique furniture but lack basic facilities and plumbing. In 1919 the ivy was removed from Old Court and a roughcast rendering was put in its place, followed by a major restoration in 1952 paid for by donations from old members.

During the summer months students are permitted to sit on the lawn in Old Court and garden parties may be held whereas, like other Oxbridge colleges, normally only fellows are allowed to walk on the lawns. There is a large plaque, on the northern wall, dedicated to Christopher Marlowe and John Fletcher, both famous playwrights who studied at Corpus. Standing inside Old Court one can see the tower of St Bene&#x27;t&#x27;s Church, the oldest building in Cambridge, and the Old Cavendish Laboratory where the structure of DNA was solved by Watson and Crick and groundbreaking work on the structure of the atom was conducted by J. J. Thomson and Ernest Rutherford. Around 1500, the master, Thomas Cosyn built a brick gallery which connects Old Court with St. Benet&#x27;s Church; the gallery is now part of an Old Court room set.

=== St Bene&#x27;t&#x27;s Church ===

The adjacent St Bene&#x27;t&#x27;s Church served as the college&#x27;s chapel until 1579 when one was built specifically for the purpose. The college remains the patron. The tower of St Bene&#x27;t&#x27;s is the oldest building in Cambridge dating back to before the Norman Conquest, built in the late Anglo-Saxon period. It is also notable for being the birthplace of the practice of ringing the changes, which was started by Fabian Stedman, a parish clerk, in 1670.

=== New Court ===
New Court (completed 1827) was designed by William Wilkins, who is buried in the vaults of the college chapel. Although he went on to design the curtain wall in front of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge and the National Gallery in London, he considered Corpus to be his favourite work and requested to be buried in the Chapel. A plaque commemorating him is in the entrance to the Parker Library within the court. This court also housed the Butler Library, the college&#x27;s student library, directly below the Parker Library. Upon completion of the building works in 2008, it relocated to the new Library Court and was renamed the Taylor Library after the project&#x27;s main benefactor John Taylor. Many of the more precious volumes in the Parker Library are now protected in vaults in what used to be the Butler Library. New Court was built to symbolise the harmony between the mind, body and soul with the Parker Library on the right representing the mind, the Hall and kitchens on the left representing the body and the Chapel in the centre representing the soul.

==== The Chapel ====

The current Chapel is the third the college has had and was completed in 1827 along with the rest of New Court. It was also designed by William Wilkins, but includes some medieval glass and features, including the fellows&#x27; stalls, several memorials and the floor of the older Elizabethan Chapel, which was demolished in the construction of New Court. The first four stained glass windows date to around 1500 and are believed to come from the Abbey of Mariawald in Germany which had been dissolved by Napoleon. Some of the pews and the pulpit of the Elizabethan chapel can now be found in St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Thurning, Norfolk. Hanging on the south wall is a depiction of the Madonna and Child by 17th-century artist Elisabetta Sirani. The Chapel also features an icon, something unusual for an Oxbridge college. The depiction of the Christ Pantocrator was painted for the college by a Greek Orthodox monk and is used as a focus for meditation.

The Chapel was extended in the late 19th century to make room for increasing student numbers, and the chancel dates from this time. The ceiling, which had been a stone fan-ribbed vault like the ceiling of the college gatehouse, was replaced by the painted wooden ceiling still in place today.

Services are held daily and there are sung services three times a week: Evensong on a Wednesday evening, and on Sunday Holy Communion in the morning and Evensong in the evening. The Chapel choir is made up of students from both Corpus and other colleges in the university. They have released several CDs and tour regularly, previously visiting New York City and Italy.

The current organ was built by Noel Mander MBE in 1968 and the casework was designed by Stephen Dykes Bower. The previous organ was donated to Methodist College Belfast on their centenary in 1968.

==== The Parker Library ====

The collection was begun in 1376 and much improved by a bequest from Matthew Parker, the college&#x27;s Master between 1544 and 1553, who as Archbishop of Canterbury formed a fine collection of manuscripts from the libraries of dissolved monasteries. 

The Parker Collection is one of the finest and most important collections of medieval manuscripts in the world. The historian James D. Wenn has suggested that Parker may have enjoyed the protection of Sir Rowland Hill of Soulton, Shropshire, during his period of disfavour under Mary I, when this collection would have been in danger, along with Parker himself; Hill was the publisher of the Geneva Bible and joined Parker as a Commissioner for Ecclesiastical Cases in 1559.

The building was completed in 1827 in the construction of Wilkin&#x27;s New Court. Currently the collection comprises over 600 manuscripts, around 480 of which were given by Parker, who also donated around 1000 printed volumes.

Its most famous possession is the St Augustine Gospels, probably brought to England by St Augustine, when he was sent by Pope Gregory I to convert the people of Britain in 598 AD. The Gospels are still used in the enthronement of the Archbishops of Canterbury today and are transported to and from Canterbury by the Master and college representatives. It also contains the principal manuscript of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, works by Matthew Paris, and Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot;, to name only a few.

In a joint venture between the college, the University Library and Stanford University in the United States of America the entire collection was digitised and is now available on the internet. Completed in 2010, the process involved the digitisation of over 200,000 separate pages.

=== Kwee Court (formerly Library Court) ===

In 2005, the lease of the bank adjacent to Corpus expired and the college reclaimed it to begin construction of Library Court. Due to be completed in 2007, the project overran due to archaeological finds and issues removing the bank vault.

Library Court was completed in January 2008 and houses the college&#x27;s student centre which includes the college bar, JCR and the Taylor Library along with new college offices. The Taylor Library was largely funded by and named after John Taylor, a former graduate of the college, inventor of the cordless kettle and former chairman of Strix Ltd, an electric kettle thermostat manufacturer.

While the outer facade of the bank building facing onto Trumpington Street, designed by architect Horace Francis, is Grade II listed, the interior was not. The inside was stripped out and a modern library was installed. The other rooms including the bar, student rooms, fellows rooms and student centre were remodelled within the existing building. Facing onto Library Court from the Taylor Library is a large window decorated by an engraving by Lida Kindersley. The project was designed by Wright &amp; Wright Architects of London. The building has received several awards including the 2009 Royal Institute of British Architects Award in the East.

On 19 September 2008, physicist Stephen Hawking unveiled a new clock called the Chronophage, which means &quot;Time Eater&quot; in Greek. It is situated facing onto the corner of King&#x27;s Parade and Trumpington where the old entrance to the bank used to be. The clock is unusual not only because of its design but also because it is accurate only once every five minutes. The clock was conceived, designed and paid for by Taylor and donated to his &quot;alma mater&quot;. The clock is neon lit at night.

In 2013, the Library Court was renamed Kwee Court after a large financial donation was made to the college. Students and fellows, however, continue to refer to the court by its traditional name. The donation – made by the Kwee family – was made on the condition that a balcony was built somewhere in the college. As most of the college buildings are Grade I listed, the only practical space for a balcony was in library court. The balcony (Kwee Balcony) is at the far end of the court from the entrance to the library.

=== Leckhampton ===

Leckhampton is a large, separate campus for postgraduate students. It is situated about a mile west of the main College site (which is traditionally referred to by postgraduate students as the &#x27;Old House&#x27;, to differentiate it from Leckhampton), just outside the city centre and is set off Grange Road. Here there are playing fields, 9½ acres (38,000 m2) of gardens and an open-air swimming pool. The site is made up of a Victorian mansion called Leckhampton House and the grade-II listed George Thomson Building, as well as five substantial detached houses on Cranmer Road, one house on Selwyn Gardens, and one house on Barton Road; all other than Barton Road back on to communal gardens and constitute a single site. In 2012, a new, purpose-built accommodation building was built to house additional students. The new Kho Building was opened on 14 September 2012 by the College Visitor and Chancellor of the University, the Lord Sainsbury of Turville. The site is known by students of the College as &#x27;Leck&#x27;.

=== Other buildings and gardens ===
There are several outlying college properties. These include Bene&#x27;t Street Hostel, above The Eagle, Newnham House, located near to Newnham College and Botolph Court which is said to be built on top of a 17th-century plague pit and slowly sinking into it.
The Robert Beldam Building, adjacent to Bene&#x27;t Street Hostel, is a modern accommodation block completed in the 1990s. It includes the McCrum Lecture Theatre. Additionally, the college owns two houses (Nos. 6 &amp; 8) in Trumpington Street, known in the college as &quot;T&quot; Street, which are almost directly opposite the University Engineering Department.

Between Trumpington Street and Library Court are a series of terraced houses, also designed by Wilkins, owned by the college. All have been reclaimed by the college for use as student rooms or part of the Library except for the block used by the Trumpington Street Medical Practice. The doors leading from Trumpington Street have been sealed and the buildings can only be entered through Library Court.

There are two main gardens in the main college campus, the Bursar&#x27;s Garden and the Master&#x27;s Garden, the latter being the private garden of the Master and his family attached to the Master&#x27;s Lodge. The Bursar&#x27;s garden is a small garden situated between New Court, the Chapel and Old Court. Students are allowed to sit there throughout the Easter term at certain times of day. It is notable for the mulberry tree which was given to the college by King James I as part of his abortive attempt to found a silk industry in England. There is a door leading out onto Free School Lane accessible through the Bursar&#x27;s Garden.

=== Gallery ===
== Student life ==
Most of the undergraduates, who refer to themselves as &quot;Corpuscles&quot;, live in or very near the main college campus. Unlike most other colleges there is a dedicated accommodation site for graduates in Leckhampton.

As with all Cambridge colleges, Corpus has its own student unions (combination rooms) for both undergraduates and graduates, the JCR and MCR respectively. Confusingly, the JCR (Junior Combination Room) is also the name for the entire student body &#x27;en masse&#x27; (including the graduates) and the name of the student common room as well. On 14 November 2010, the JCR and MCR student bodies disaffiliated from CUSU, after holding a College-wide ballot in which 71% of undergraduates and 86% of postgraduates that voted were in favour of disaffiliation.

In 2008 the college bar was relocated from New Court to an underground position in the newly built Library Court. It hosts regular themed parties known in Corpus slang as a &quot;slack&quot;, (e.g. the Hallowe&#x27;en slack). Like most other colleges, Corpus owns a punt named &quot;Prudence&quot;, she can only be used by members of the MCR with the permission of the &#x27;Admiral of the Punt&#x27;. Unfortunately, she is no longer river-worthy after being used (as is traditional) as a drinks dispenser at the 2011 May Ball.

Corpus hosts a biennial May Ball on the Friday of May Week.

Dramatically, each spring a duck chooses to lay her eggs in a flower pot in Old Court some 200 m from the River Cam. When the ducklings hatch and are ready to leave for the water one of the porters must stop traffic on Trumpington Street to allow the duck and her offspring to cross. The porters from St Catharine&#x27;s across the road open the gates of their college and take over the responsibility of getting them to the river from there.

=== Corpus challenge ===
Every year Corpus competes with its sister college in Oxford, also called Corpus Christi, in the &quot;Corpus Challenge&quot;. Both colleges compete in many sports including football, rugby, hockey and rowing races as well as darts, table tennis, pool and board games. Winning an individual sport accrues a set number of points with the totals deciding the overall winners. The location of &#x27;The Challenge&#x27; alternates between the colleges every year. In 2017, it was held in Oxford, who won the cup on home soil.

=== Playroom ===
The Corpus Playroom is a student theatre situated on St Edward&#x27;s Passage. It opened in 1979 and was, until 2001, run solely by the students of Corpus Christi. In 2011 the ADC Theatre took over the management of the Playroom, working alongside the college and the Fletcher Players, the college drama society, named after the Corpus alumnus and playwright, John Fletcher. The Playroom has an important place in the drama landscape of Cambridge, being the only other permanent student venue apart from the ADC. Several notable performers and directors have played there including Emma Thompson, Hugh Bonneville (alumnus of Corpus Christi), Sam Mendes and Stephen Fry, who is the Playroom&#x27;s patron. The Playroom is currently undergoing a fund-raising campaign to renovate and expand its facilities.

== Traditions and anecdotes ==

=== College ghosts ===
The College is said to be haunted by a number of ghosts. Most famous, and feared, is the terrifying apparition of Henry Butts, hero of the plague of 1630, who hanged himself with his garters in the then Master&#x27;s Lodge on Easter Sunday, 1632. Butts&#x27; ghost was subject to an attempted (and purportedly unsuccessful) exorcism by three students in 1904. The last sighting of Butts was in 1967 as a half length figure of a man in the passage between New Court and Old Court.

Another is that of Elizabeth Spencer and her young lover (both died in 1667). Elizabeth was the daughter of the then Master, John Spencer and apart from the Master&#x27;s wife, the only woman in college. One of the students, James Betts, became enamoured with her and they regularly had tea together. On one such occasion her father interrupted them and she bungled Betts into a wardrobe. She then went away for some time leaving him in the cupboard, which only opened from the outside. When she came back to the cupboard she discovered he had asphyxiated. Elizabeth, in a fit of grief, committed suicide, throwing herself from the roof of Old Court. Their ghosts are said to walk on Christmas Eve.

There have been few sightings of either apparition since the early 20th Century. This may have been because the Master in the 1930s, Sir Will Spens, let it be known that anyone complaining of a ghost would be sent down.

=== Coat of arms ===
The college&#x27;s coat of arms consists of a quartered shield featuring a pelican on a red background in the top left and bottom right corners and three white lilies on a blue background in the top right and bottom left corners.
The coat of arms was granted in 1570 by Robert Cooke, Clarencieux King of Arms, at the request of the Master, Archbishop Matthew Parker. It was by this that Parker introduced into the college the symbol of the mythical pelican with the body of a swan and the head of an eagle. It was believed in the Middle Ages that a pelican lived in a tree and laid three eggs; and that after they hatched the pelican quarrels with them and inadvertently kills them, while the mother pelican pecked at her own breast, spilling her blood on them and restoring them to life. This became a potent symbol for Christ feeding his followers spiritually with his body and blood. It was often associated with the Corpus Christi cult during the Middle Ages but not with the Cambridge guild until the granting of the arms in the 16th Century.

The white lilies on a blue background are an ancient symbol of the Virgin Mary. The two symbols therefore incorporate the two constituent guilds of Corpus Christi and the Blessed Virgin Mary.

Although the college officially has no motto, the college toast, &quot;Floreat Antiqua Domus&quot; (i.e. &quot;May the old house flourish&quot;) is often used as such. The nickname &#x27;Old House&#x27; has historically been used to refer to the whole college, but most usually to designate the main college buildings, as opposed to outlying places.

The College colours used on scarves, ties, and various sports&#x27; kits are two white stripes on a cerise background. The Boat Club use maroon, rather than the cerise shade of pink, for their strips and oar blades. The other sports teams use maroon or sometimes a lighter pink. The Chapel scarf, worn by the choir or chapel wardens, is a dark maroon background with two white stripes on either side of a navy blue stripe running down the middle.

=== Grace ===
Formal dinners are held in the college&#x27;s hall on Friday, Sunday, and some Wednesdays. Before the meal starts, a gong is sounded and the attendees stand as the fellows and their guests come in from the Old Combination Room to sit at High Table. The following Latin grace is then said:
Before dinner at Leckhampton, the College&#x27;s postgraduate campus, a silent grace is held, with diners pausing to collect their thoughts and silently offer their own thanks before sitting. This unique tradition stems from the first dinner at Leckhampton, when new students and fellows, not knowing if the College grace should be said, hesitated awkwardly before sitting for dinner.

== In popular culture ==

* In &quot;Porterhouse Blue&quot; and &quot;Grantchester Grind&quot; by Tom Sharpe, the college is mentioned several times throughout the books including a scene where the Senior Tutor wakes after having &quot;dined in Corpus&quot; the night before with such a bad hangover he becomes convinced he is insane. Corpus also appeared in the television adaptation of &quot;Porterhouse Blue&quot;.
* In &quot;Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell&quot; by Susanna Clarke when Lascelles and Drawlight are discussing Jonathan Strange, he is described as the man who &quot;when an undergraduate at Cambridge, frightened a cat belonging to the Master of Corpus Christi&quot;.
* In &quot;The Black Death: The Intimate Story of a Village in Crisis 1345–1350&quot;, which is a fictionalised account of the trials of the village of Walsham during the plague by John Hatcher, himself a fellow of Corpus, the author makes regular reference to the guild of Corpus Christi in Cambridge.
* In &quot;Engleby&quot; by Sebastian Faulks there are several references to Corpus. At one point Engleby is talking about acquiring opium that he bought &quot;from a boy who got it from a Modern History fellow in Corpus Christi&quot;.
* Several of the college buildings briefly appear in the Doctor Who serial &quot;Shada&quot; with Tom Baker as the Doctor. The show was never broadcast and the episode became the subject of some controversy when it was cancelled by the BBC. It was released on video in 1992.
* In the novel, &quot;The Night Climbers&quot;, by Ivo Stourton, himself a graduate of the college, Stourton refers to Corpus Christi on several occasions.
* The Parker Library, and more often documents from it, make an appearance in several TV documentaries, particularly in those dealing with the Anglo-Saxons and the Medieval period. Notable amongst these are David Starkey&#x27;s &quot;Monarchy&quot; and David Dimbleby&#x27;s &quot;Seven Ages of Britain&quot;. Most recently, Christopher de Hamel, then the Donnelly Fellow Librarian, appeared on the BBC Four series &quot;The Beauty of Books&quot;.
* The front of the college chapel appears on the cover of Andrew Douglas&#x27;s book, &quot;The King&#x27;s Codebreaker&quot; the first in the Thomas Hill trilogy about an Oxford academic working for the King during the English Civil War in 1643. The use of the college as the cover is unusual given that the college is not in Oxford, neither was the facade of the Chapel built until the 1820s.
* The college features prominently in the second episode of &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot;, a two-part documentary presented by Cambridge academic Michael C Scott on the subject of luxury. Several shots included the Wilkins Room of the Parker Library, the front of the Chapel and Old Court. Scott also discusses the foundation of the college, with the help of the Duke of Lancaster, as an example of the nature of luxury changing in the Middle Ages.
* New Court and the Chapel, as viewed from the main gate, feature in the British Government&#x27;s GREAT Campaign to promote the UK abroad. The College Chapel is pictured under the caption &quot;Knowledge is Great Britain&quot; and above the bottom half of a Union flag.

<doc id="268295" wikidata="Q387163" url="?curid=268295" title="Copper Country">
<text>The Copper Country is an area in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the United States, including Keweenaw County, Michigan, Houghton, Baraga and Ontonagon counties as well as part of Marquette County. The area is so named as copper mining was prevalent there from 1845 until the late 1960s, with one mine (the White Pine mine) continuing through 1995. The region includes Copper Island, Copper Harbor and Isle Royale. In its heyday in the latter half of the 19th century and the early 20th century, the area was the world&#x27;s greatest producer of copper.

==Native copper==

Copper Country is highly unusual among mining districts in that the copper mined was predominantly in its elemental (&quot;native&quot;) form, rather than in the form of compounds (mostly oxides and sulfides) that form the basis of the copper ore at almost every other copper-mining district.

==History==


Supporting the Old Copper complex, Native Americans mined copper from small pits as early as 3000 B.C. on this peninsula in Lake Superior. Native artifacts made from copper have been found from Michigan through Wisconsin to Minnesota along the Lake. 

Douglass Houghton, the State Geologist of Michigan in the mid-1800s and later to become mayor of Detroit, reported on the copper deposits in 1841. The first successful copper mine, the Cliff mine, began operations in 1845, and spurred by venture capital from Boston and other East Coast investors, many other mines quickly followed. Mining of the most productive deposit, the Calumet conglomerate, began in 1865. Mining took place along a belt that stretched about 100 miles southwest to northeast.

While mining in Copper Country continues to this day, it is on a much smaller scale than before, with tourism and logging having taken over as the area&#x27;s largest industries.

==Immigrants to Copper Country==
Initially, Irish, Cornish, French-Canadian and German immigrants came to mine copper on the peninsula. They were followed by large numbers of Finns, Swedes, Danes, Sámi and Norwegians who immigrated to the Upper Peninsula, especially the Keweenaw Peninsula, to work in the mines. The immigration of people from Finland peaked from 1899 to World War I. Slovenes, Croatians, and Italians emigrated from about 1880, the first two groups sometimes called Austrians as their homelands were then part of the Austrian Empire. Polish people also were attracted to this successful mining area. Thus the pattern in this boom period was first the Native Americans and people from the British Isles, French Canada and Western Europe, followed by people from the Nordic countries, and then by people from Southern and Eastern Europe. The Finns in particular stayed on and prospered even after the copper mines closed, while most moved on to other mining areas or homesteaded in other Midwestern states.

The list of ethnic groups included the aforementioned Nordic peoples, Chinese; Cornish; Croatians; French Canadians; Germans; Irish; Italians; Native Americans; Poles; and Slovenes.

==After the copper mining==
Popular tourist destinations include the cities of Copper Harbor, Houghton, and the Porcupine Mountains with Lake of the Clouds. Snowmobiling is very popular in the winter, and snowmobile trails are found in most areas.

The Copper Country is largely rural, and much of it has been designated as state parks or similar designations. These include McLain State Park, Porcupine Mountains State Park, and the Copper Country State Forest. The Keweenaw National Historical Park includes several important sites relating to the area&#x27;s copper-mining history.

Institutions of higher education include the former Finlandia University in Hancock, founded in 1896 as Suomi College (closed in 2023), and Michigan Technological University in Houghton, originally established in 1885 as the Michigan School of Mines. Finlandia University was affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, reflecting the spiritual heritage of the region&#x27;s many Finnish immigrants. Michigan Tech was founded in response to the needs of the copper mines.

Industrial pollution leftover from the former mining operations remains a significant problem in the region. Copper processing produced enormous quantities of stamp sand as a waste product, which was often stored in large, unsecured piles near the coast. In the town of Gay, Michigan, stamp sands from a former mill have escaped into the lake and gradually moved South along the coast, burying the natural shoreline, creating new land, and obstructing piers and waterways.

===Winter snowfall===
The Copper Country averages more snowfall than any part of the United States east of the Mississippi River, and more snowfall than any non-mountainous region of the continental United States.

<doc id="268300" wikidata="Q1844502" url="?curid=268300" title="Punk-O-Rama">
<text>Punk-O-Rama is the title given to a series of ten compilation albums published by Epitaph Records. The first volume was released in 1994, the second in 1996, and the rest annually from 1998 to 2005. The albums included artists from Epitaph&#x27;s roster as well as from its subsidiary label ANTI- and its partnership labels Hellcat Records and Burning Heart Records. In total the series included 257 songs contributed by 88 different artists.

Rancid and Pennywise are the only bands to appear on all 10 volumes. Scott Radinsky appears on all 10, 1 with Ten Foot Pole and 9 with Pulley.

As its title implied, the series featured mostly punk rock and various punk subgenres such as garage punk, hardcore punk, pop punk, post-hardcore, ska punk, skate punk, and street punk. However, as the series went on and the labels&#x27; rosters diversified, the music of the &quot;Punk-O-Rama&quot; compilations grew to include additional styles of music such as alternative hip hop, alternative rock, digital hardcore, emo, experimental music, garage rock, indie rock, metalcore, psychobilly, and screamo.

Artwork for the series was inconsistent over the first four installments, with cover art and layout provided by varying artists and designers. C. Martin provided artwork and layout for both the fifth and sixth volumes, though they had differing styles and themes. Nick Pritchard of Metrosea.com provided artwork and layout for the final four volumes of the series, which adopted a similar look and style.

Epitaph also organized several &quot;Punk-O-Rama&quot; tours featuring bands that had contributed to the compilations, such as Agnostic Front, All, The Distillers, Guttermouth, Millencolin, Straight Faced, and the Voodoo Glow Skulls. Occasionally these would be accompanied by special &quot;Punk-O-Rama&quot; tour sampler CDs that differed from the main. series of compilation albums. In 2003 the label published the DVD &quot;Punk-O-Rama: The Videos, Volume 1&quot;, including 22 music videos and &quot;The Epitaph Story&quot;, a short film relating the history of the label. Though a second volume was never published, the subsequent ninth and tenth albums in the compilation series included DVDs of music videos as well.

In 2006 Epitaph announced the retirement of the &quot;Punk-O-Rama&quot; brand in favor of a new series titled &quot;Unsound&quot;, the less genre-specific title being more conducive to the label&#x27;s expanding roster of musical styles. However, only one compilation was published under the &quot;Unsound&quot; banner before that series was also discontinued.

# &quot;Glass&quot; – Eyedea &amp; Abilities
# &quot;NFA&quot; – The Special Goodness

==== &quot;Unsound&quot; (2006) ====
Unsound is the first, and currently only, compilation released in the &quot;Unsound&quot; series, which replaced Epitaph Records&#x27; &quot;Punk-O-Rama&quot; series. Epitaph chose to change the name of the compilation series because the name &quot;Punk-O-Rama&quot;, especially in its later releases, no longer reflected the wide range of music released on the compilations. &quot;Unsound&quot; is similar to the last two entries in the &quot;Punk-O-Rama&quot; series in that it is a two-disc set with a CD and a DVD, which contains music videos of bands on the CD.

<text>Jeanette &quot;Jennie&quot; Spencer-Churchill (; 9 January 1854 – 29 June 1921), known as Lady Randolph Spencer-Churchill, was an American-born British socialite, the wife of Lord Randolph Churchill, and the mother of British prime minister Winston Churchill.

==Early life==
Jennie Jerome was born in the Cobble Hill section of Brooklyn in 1854, the second of four daughters (one died in childhood) of financier, sportsman, and speculator Leonard Jerome and his wife Clarissa (always called Clara), daughter of Ambrose Hall, a landowner. Jerome&#x27;s father was of Huguenot extraction, his forebears having emigrated to America from the Isle of Wight in 1710. Hall family lore insists that Jennie had Iroquois ancestry through her maternal grandmother; however, there is no research or evidence to corroborate this.

She was raised in Brooklyn, Paris, and New York City. She had two surviving sisters, Clarita (1851–1935) and Leonie (1859–1943). Another sister, Camille (1855–1863) died when Jennie was nine.

There is some disagreement regarding the time and place of her birth. A plaque at 426 Henry St. gives her year of birth as 1850, not 1854. However, on 9 January 1854, the Jeromes lived nearby at number 8 Amity Street (since renumbered as 197). It is believed that the Jeromes were temporarily staying at the Henry Street address, which was owned by Leonard&#x27;s brother Addison, and that Jennie was born there during a snowstorm.

She was a noted beauty; an admirer, Lord d&#x27;Abernon, said that there was &quot;more of the panther than of the woman in her look.&quot;

==Personal life==
Jennie was a talented amateur pianist, having been tutored as a girl by Stephen Heller, a friend of Chopin. Heller believed that his young pupil was good enough to attain &quot;concert standard&quot; with the necessary &quot;hard work&quot;, of which, according to author Mary S. Lovell, he was not confident she was capable.

In 1909, when American impresario Charles Frohman became sole manager of The Globe Theatre, the first production was &quot;His Borrowed Plumes&quot;, written by Jennie. Although Mrs Patrick Campbell produced and took the lead role in the play, it was a commercial failure. It was at this point that Campbell began an affair with Jennie’s then husband, George Cornwallis-West.

Jennie served as the chair of the hospital committee for the American Women&#x27;s War Relief Fund starting in 1914. This organization helped fund and staff two hospitals during World War I.

===First marriage===

Jennie Jerome was married for the first time on 15 April 1874, aged 20, at the British Embassy in Paris, to Lord Randolph Churchill, the third son of John Winston Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough and Lady Frances Anne Vane. The couple had met at a sailing regatta on the Isle of Wight in August 1873, having been introduced by the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII. 

Although they became engaged within three days of this initial meeting, the marriage was delayed for months while their parents argued over settlements. By this marriage, she was properly known as Lady Randolph Churchill and would have been addressed in conversation as Lady Randolph.
The Churchills had two sons: Winston (1874–1965), and John (1880–1947). Winston, the future prime minister, was born less than eight months after the marriage. Amongst his biographers, there are varied opinions on whether he was conceived before the marriage (notably William Manchester), or born two months prematurely after Lady Randolph &quot;had a fall.&quot; When asked about the circumstances of his birth, Winston Churchill replied: &quot;Although present on the occasion, I have no clear recollection of the events leading up to it.&quot; Rumours also circulated about the parentage of Winston&#x27;s younger brother John, as Lady Randolph&#x27;s sisters initially believed that the biological father of the second son, John (1880–1947) was Evelyn Boscawen, 7th Viscount Falmouth, although that was mostly discredited due to the boys&#x27; striking likeness to Randolph Churchill and to each other.

Lady Randolph is believed to have had numerous lovers during her marriage, including the Prince of Wales, Milan I of Serbia, Prince Karl Kinsky, and Herbert von Bismarck.

As was the custom of the day in her social class, Lady Randolph played a limited role in her sons&#x27; upbringing, relying largely upon nannies, especially Elizabeth Everest. Winston worshipped his mother, writing her numerous letters during his time at school and begging her to visit him, which she rarely did. He wrote about her in &quot;My Early Life&quot;: &quot;She shone for me like the evening star. I loved her dearly – but at a distance.&quot; After he became an adult, they became good friends and strong allies, to the point where Winston regarded her almost as a political mentor, and “on even terms, more like brother and sister than mother and son.” 

Lady Randolph was well-respected and influential in the highest British social and political circles. She was said to be intelligent, witty, and quick to laughter. It was said that Queen Alexandra especially enjoyed her company, although Lady Randolph had been involved in an affair with her husband the king, which was well known to Alexandra. Through her family contacts and her extramarital romantic relationships, Lady Randolph greatly helped her husband&#x27;s early career, as well as that of her son Winston.

===Later marriages===
Lord Randolph died in 1895, aged 45. His death freed Jennie to move on effortlessly despite her lack of money; she mixed in the highest London society circles. Attending a weekend party in July 1898 hosted by Daisy Warwick, Jennie was introduced to George Cornwallis-West, a captain in the Scots Guards who was just 16 days older than her own son Winston; he was instantly smitten, and they spent much time together. George and Jennie were married on 28 July 1900 at St Paul&#x27;s Church, Knightsbridge.

Around this time, Jennie became well known for chartering the hospital ship Maine to care for those wounded in the Second Boer War. She headed the effort to charter the ship in partnership with two American-born socialites residing in London: Jennie Goodell Blow and Fanny Ronalds. For this work, Churchill was awarded the decoration of the Royal Red Cross (RRC) in the South Africa Honours list published on 26 June 1902. Churchill received the decoration in person from King Edward VII on 2 October 1902 during a visit to Balmoral Castle. 

In 1908, she wrote her memoirs, &quot;The Reminiscences of Lady Randolph Churchill.&quot; 

George doted on Jennie, amorously nicknaming her &quot;pussycat&quot;. However, they drifted apart. The Churchills were becoming a dedicated literary family, and George, who was a financial failure in the City, slowly fell out of love with his wife, who was old enough to be his mother. Short of money, Jennie contemplated selling the family home in Hertfordshire to move into the Ritz Hotel in Piccadilly. George was in fragile health, and recuperated at the Swiss skiing resort of St Moritz. Jennie took to writing plays for the West End, in many of which the star was Mrs. Patrick Campbell.

Jennie separated from George in 1912, and they were divorced in April 1914, whereupon Cornwallis-West married Mrs. Campbell. Jennie dropped the surname &quot;Cornwallis-West&quot;, and resumed, by deed poll, the name &quot;Lady Randolph Churchill.&quot;

Her third marriage, on 1 June 1918, was to Montagu Phippen Porch (1877–1964), a member of the British Civil Service in Nigeria, who was younger than her son Winston by three years. At the end of World War I, Porch resigned from the colonial service. After Jennie&#x27;s death, he returned to West Africa, where his business investments had proven successful.

==Death==

In May 1921, while Montagu Porch was away in Africa, Jennie slipped while coming down a friend&#x27;s staircase wearing new high-heeled shoes, breaking her ankle. Gangrene set in, and her left leg was amputated above the knee on 10 June. At age 67, she died at her home at 8 Westbourne Street in London on 29 June, following a haemorrhage of an artery in her thigh resulting from the amputation.

She was buried in the Churchill family plot at St Martin&#x27;s Church, Bladon, Oxfordshire, next to her first husband.

==Cocktail misattribution==
The invention of the Manhattan cocktail is sometimes erroneously attributed to Jennie Churchill, who supposedly asked a bartender to make a special drink to celebrate the election of Samuel J. Tilden to the New York governorship in 1874. However, though the drink is believed to have been invented by the Manhattan Club (an association of New York Democrats) on that occasion, Jennie could not have been involved as she was in Europe at the time, about to give birth to her son Winston later that month.

<text>Estonia is a country in the Baltic region of Northern Europe. It is a developed country with an advanced, high-income economy that as of 2011 is among the fastest growing in the EU. Its Human Development Index ranks very highly, and it performs favourably in measurements of economic freedom, civil liberties and press freedom (3rd in the world in 2012 and 2007). The 2015 PISA test places Estonian high school students 3rd in the world, behind Singapore and Japan. Citizens of Estonia are provided with universal health care, free education and the longest paid maternity leave in the OECD. Since independence the country has rapidly developed its IT sector, becoming one of the world&#x27;s most digitally advanced societies. In 2005 Estonia became the first nation to hold elections over the Internet, and in 2014 the first nation to provide E-residency.

<doc id="268311" wikidata="Q2095418" url="?curid=268311" title="Pinball Construction Set">
<text>Pinball Construction Set is a video game by Bill Budge written for the Apple II. It was originally published in 1982 through Budge&#x27;s own company, BudgeCo, then was released by Electronic Arts in 1983 along with ports to the Atari 8-bit computers and Commodore 64.

The game created a new genre of video games: the construction set. Users can build and play their own virtual pinball machine by dropping bumpers, flippers, spinners, and other parts onto a table. Attributes such as gravity and the physics model can be modified. Tables can be saved to floppy disks and freely traded; &quot;Pinball Construction Set&quot; is not needed to play them.

Versions were released for the IBM PC compatibles (as a self-booting disk) and Mac in 1985. EA followed &quot;Pinball Construction Set&quot; with &quot;Music Construction Set&quot;, &quot;Adventure Construction Set&quot;, and &quot;Racing Destruction Set&quot; all from different authors.

==Development==

Bill Budge, author of the &quot;Raster Blaster&quot; pinball game for the Apple II, began developing &quot;Pinball Construction Set&quot; in July 1982. He did not want to write another game (&quot;all the current (arcade) games are either maze games or &quot;Pong&quot;; I didn&#x27;t want any part of that&quot;), but began experimenting with game and graphical tools he had written. As part of the development process he purchased and disassembled an old Gottlieb &quot;Target Alpha&quot; pinball machine, so his new project could accurately depict its components. Budge does not enjoy playing video games, and described having to play pinball for months while developing &quot;Pinball Construction Set&quot; as &quot;sheer torture&quot;.

The project was ambitious given the Apple&#x27;s limited memory and graphics capabilities. While Budge did not work on the Apple Lisa project as an Apple employee from 1980 to 1981 he was aware of it and the Graphic User Interface research at Xerox PARC, and gave &quot;Pinball Construction Set&quot; a Lisa-like user interface. He originally published and distributed the game via his publishing company BudgeCo in late 1982; the box art was a photograph of the parts of the disassembled pinball machine. It did not sell well, however, as BudgeCo did not have the distribution network that other, larger companies did. Budge agreed to have EA to publish his game when Trip Hawkins approached him in 1983. &quot;Raster Blaster&quot; and other projects had already made Budge a celebrity among Apple II owners, and his name was much larger than the name of the software on EA&#x27;s &quot;Pinball Construction Set&quot; box art.

==Reception==
&quot;Pinball Construction Set&quot;″s sales had surpassed 250,000 copies by November 1989, and it ultimately sold over 300,000 copies in all platforms.

&quot;Pinball Construction Set&quot;″s scope and flexibility on a 48K Apple II was impressive. Steve Wozniak called it &quot;the greatest program ever written for an 8-bit machine&quot;, and for thousands the software was their first experience with a GUI. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1983 considered the software toy revolutionary, and easy to understand because of its representative icons and drag-and-drop method of constructing a table; the magazine stated that &quot;there&#x27;s something almost magical about the way this product works. You take everything it does for granted after just a few minutes&quot;. The nine-page manual was considered &quot;overkill&quot;, since &quot;Pinball Construction Set&quot; required no programming knowledge; an eight-year-old had no problems creating his own tables. Reviewing the Atari version in their &quot;Arcade Alley&quot; column, &quot;Video&quot; magazine described &quot;Pinball Construction Set&quot; as a &quot;remarkably clever and easy-to-use program&quot;, and noted that a third-party company had already published a suite of pre-made pinball games for use with the construction set.

&quot;BYTE&quot; found the tool kit as &quot;complete&quot; and praised Budge&#x27;s &quot;marvelous sense of programming&quot;. The magazine reported that &quot;creativity is encouraged. [Users] are gently encouraged and aided. This is valuable for children and inexperienced players and computer users&quot;. &quot;InfoWorld&quot; compared the game&#x27;s importance to that of Scott Adams&#x27;s &quot;Adventureland&quot;, and predicted that it &quot;is sure to have lots of children and grandchildren&quot;. &quot;InfoWorld&#x27;s Essential Guide to Atari Computers&quot; cited it as a notable arcade game. &quot;Ahoy!&quot; called &quot;Pinball Construction Set&quot; as one of the best home entertainment programs of its era. &quot;The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984&quot; gave the &quot;pinball wizard&#x27;s dream&quot; an overall A+ rating, praising the user interface as &quot;exceptionally human engineered&quot;. &quot;Compute!&quot; listed it in 1988 as one of &quot;Our Favorite Games&quot;, calling the game &quot;a programming work of art ... a classic that never seems to grow old&quot;. Orson Scott Card said in the magazine in 1989 that the program was so flexible that his son used it as a graphics program.

===Awards===
In 1984 &quot;Pinball Construction Set&quot; received a Certificate of Merit in the category of &quot;1984 Most Innovative Video Game/Computer Game&quot; at the 5th annual Arkie Awards. One month later &quot;Softline&quot; readers named the game the ninth most-popular Apple and Atari program of 1983. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1996 declared &quot;Pinball Construction Set&quot; the 50th-best computer game ever released, and ranked it #1 in the magazine&#x27;s list of the most innovative computer games. &quot;Pinball Construction Set&quot; is an inductee in GameSpy&#x27;s Hall of Fame. In 2008, &quot;Pinball Construction Set&quot; was honored at the 59th Annual Technology and Engineering Emmy Awards for &quot;User Generated Content/Game Modification&quot;.

==Legacy==
A version for the Coleco Adam combined with &quot;Hard Hat Mack&quot; under the title &quot;The Best of Electronic Arts&quot; was completed but not released.

In 1993, Budge wrote a version of &quot;Pinball Construction Set&quot; for the Sega Genesis with the name &quot;Virtual Pinball&quot;.

Will Wright cited the game as an inspiration.

In 2013, Budge released the source code to the Atari 8-bit family version of &quot;Pinball Construction Set&quot; to the public on GitHub under the MIT license.

<doc id="268316" wikidata="Q4633087" url="?curid=268316" title="2DTV">
<text>2DTV is a British satirical animated television series which was co-created and produced by Giles Pilbrow for ITV. It premiered on ITV on 27 March 2001 and was nominated for the Rose d&#x27;Or Award in both 2002 and 2003.

The programme was considered the spiritual successor of &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, a 1980s series that also featured work by Pilbrow. The show&#x27;s style also paid homage to the animation studio Hanna-Barbera. The voice cast included Jon Culshaw, Jan Ravens and Mark Perry. &quot;2DTV&quot; ran for five series before being cancelled in 2004 due to falling viewing figures. It was succeeded in 2008 by the short-lived series &quot;Headcases&quot;.

==Background==
&quot;2DTV&quot; employed the same satirical style as &quot;Spitting Image&quot; but used animation rather than puppets. The animation was produced using computer graphics, frequently with animators working up to the day of broadcast. The producer, Giles Pilbrow, was a veteran of &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, as were some of the show&#x27;s voice artists.

The series was directed by Tim Searle. &quot;2DTV&quot; was first broadcast in 2001, but an un-broadcast pilot episode was recorded nearly six months earlier. The pilot episode featured the resident newsreader played by Alistair McGowan, but the character was not carried over when the full seven-part first series was commissioned by ITV. Each episode in the first series lasted ten minutes.

A second seven-episode series began broadcasting in 2002, with each episode again lasting ten minutes. The series spawned its own official single in July 2002, &quot;Shoot the Dog&quot;, performed by George Michael. The music video features an animated Michael, plus several other characters from &quot;2DTV&quot; performing the song.

A commercial for the home media compilation &quot;The Best of 2DTV&quot; was banned by the Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre in 2002. The commercial depicted George W. Bush taking one VHS out of its case and putting it in his toaster. Ofcom stated that advertisements for products cannot appear to be endorsed by someone without their permission – in this case, George W. Bush. The original advert was reworked into a sketch in which Bush writes a letter complaining about being portrayed as a moron by the media, then proceeding to &quot;post&quot; the letter in his toaster. The programme creators subsequently proposed another commercial, this time satirising Osama bin Laden, but they were informed that this would also be banned on the grounds that Bin Laden would have to give permission for his image to be used.

Another commercial satirised David Beckham compiling his list for Christmas, asking his wife; &quot;how do you spell DVD?&quot;. A ban was later overturned on the grounds that the commercial was legitimate satire and the commercial was shown unedited. The programme&#x27;s creators claimed that the controversy generated more interest in the show than the adverts could ever have done alone.

For the third series, each episode was extended to 20 minutes, including advertisements. After the third series, many of the original cast members, including Jon Culshaw, Jan Ravens and Mark Perry, decided to leave following an announcement that the fourth series would be extended to 30 minutes per episode. New cast members Lewis MacLeod, Kate O&#x27;Sullivan and Enn Reitel took over, appearing alongside the only remaining original cast member, Dave Lamb. All four returned for the fifth series in 2004, but due to falling ratings, its broadcast was placed in the so-called graveyard slot, and the show was officially cancelled at the end of that year.

<text>Marus () was a Palestinian village in Upper Galilee, 7 km northeast of Safad. In the Roman and medieval period it had Jewish population, and by the 16th century it became entirely Muslim. After a period of desertion, the Ottoman authorities resettled it with Algerian Arabs in the 19th century. It was depopulated in 1948 during the Operation Hiram by the Israeli attacking brigade Sheva&#x27; Brigade.

==History and archaeology==
===Archaeology===
In 1875, Victor Guérin found major ruins here. He described the place as a destroyed Arab village.

In 1881 the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; found here: &quot;Modern and ancient ruins; a spring in a rock-cut cave, ancient foundations of good-sized stones; the foundations of a small rectangular building to the west of the eastern portion of the ruin. Some rock-cut tombs and many caves in hills around.&quot;

Starting in 1981 Zvi Ilan excavated in sites next to the 20th century village in different directions. Excavations revealed signs of a long-standing community, and Jewish presence at some periods. An ancient synagogue built in the late 4th or early 5th century, and a related Beth midrash of the 7th century, a cache of coins ranging from the 5th to 9th centuries, a necropolis partly of the 1st century CE, and sherds from Roman to early Ottoman period. There are remains of a defensive wall of large stones, and a hewn moat.

===Written sources===
====Classical era====
Based on the archaeological findings and the name Marus, archaeologist Zvi Ilan suggested Marus is to be identified with the town Meroth. Meroth () is mentioned by Josephus as a border town between Jewish Galilee and Tyre in the First Jewish–Roman War, and a place he fortified early in the war. Previous suggestions as to its location included Maroun al-Ras, and Meiron, which show less archaeological parallels. The name possibly derives from (Me&#x27;arot, &quot;caves&quot;).

====Middle Ages====
Marus is probably mentioned in a Samaritan medieval manuscript, again as the border of Tyre, and in a pilgrimage guide of the 14th century.

====Ottoman era====
In 1596, Marus was part of the Ottoman Empire, a village in the &quot;nahiya&quot; (subdistrict) of Jira under the &quot;liwa&#x27;&quot; (&quot;district&quot;) of Safad, with a population of 176. It paid taxes on a number of crops, including wheat, barley, and fruits as well as on goats. All the villagers were Muslim.

In the second half of the 19th century Algerian followers of Abdelkader El Djezairi have been defeated by the French in Algeria, and sought refuge in another part of the Ottoman Empire. They were given lands in various locations in Ottoman Syria, including Marus, and the close by Dayshum, Ammuqa, Al-Husayniyya, and Tulayl. The Algerian settlers belonged to the tribe of Awlad bu Alwarath, from Dellys, Algeria.

====British Mandate era====
In the British Mandate period the village was classified as a hamlet by the &quot;Palestine Index Gazetteer&quot;. In the 1922 census of Palestine, Marus had a population of 45; all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 59, still all Muslims, in a total of 12 houses.

In the 1945 statistics the population was 80 Muslims, and the total land area was 3,183 dunums. Of this, 108 dunums were plantations and irrigable land, 903 used for cereals, while 8 dunams were built-up (urban) land.

====Israeli rule====
The village was occupied by the Israeli Defense Force&#x27;s Sheva&#x27; Brigade, during the Operation Hiram at the close of 1948 Arab-Israeli war.

According to the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, describing the village land in 1992: &quot;The site contains some olive and fig trees as well as stones from ruined homes. The surrounding land is used for grazing.&quot;

<text>Act Now to Stop War and End Racism (ANSWER), also known as International A.N.S.W.E.R. and the ANSWER Coalition, is a United States–based protest umbrella group consisting of many antiwar and civil rights organizations. Formed in the wake of the September 11th attacks, ANSWER has since helped to organize many of the largest anti-war demonstrations in the United States, including demonstrations of hundreds of thousands against the Iraq War. The group has also organized activities around a variety of other issues, ranging from the Israel/Palestine debate to immigrant rights to Social Security to the extradition of Luis Posada Carriles.

ANSWER is closely associated with the Party for Socialism and Liberation and characterizes itself as anti-imperialist, and its steering committee consists of socialists, communists, civil rights advocates, and left-wing or progressive organizations from the Muslim, Arab, Palestinian, Filipino, Haitian, and Latin American communities.

ANSWER has faced criticism from other anti-war groups for its affiliations, tactics at demonstrations, and allegedly sectarian approach to joint anti-war work. It also faced criticism from various sources for its anti-Zionist politics.

== History ==

Many of ANSWER&#x27;s lead organizers at its founding were also members of the Workers World Party (WWP) and its affiliate, the International Action Center.

After the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) split from the WWP in 2004, ANSWER remained tightly tied to PSL. ANSWER&#x27;s National Coordinator is Brian Becker, a PSL co-founder who said &quot;we do a great deal of work through&quot; ANSWER. A writer for &quot;The New Republic&quot; described ANSWER as a PSL &quot;front group,&quot; and the two have significant financial overlap.

== Major protest actions ==
=== 2001–02 ===
ANSWER&#x27;s first major action was a September 29, 2001 &quot;Anti-War, Anti-Racist&quot; political rally and march in Washington, D.C., primarily in protest of the impending U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. An estimated 8,000 people participated.

The group&#x27;s next major demonstration took place on April 20, 2002, which according to ANSWER&#x27;s website, drew 100,000 people to Washington in the largest pro-Palestinian demonstration in U.S. history. On October 26 of that year, the group held a demonstration against Congress&#x27; vote to authorize the use of force against Iraq, which according to its website drew 100,000 in San Francisco and 200,000 in Washington, D.C.

=== 2003–04 ===
ANSWER called antiwar demonstrations on January 18, 2003, in Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, which were each attended by 200,000 people, according to the group&#x27;s website. ANSWER was one of several groups organizing the U.S. component of the worldwide February 15, 2003 anti-war protest, which was, across the globe, the largest anti-war rally that has ever taken place. ANSWER sponsored emergency demonstrations just before the launch of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, on March 15, 2003, which according to its website drew 100,000 people each in San Francisco and Washington. With United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ), it cosponsored an anti-occupation protest in Washington on October 25 of that year which, again according to the group&#x27;s website, brought out 100,000 people in Washington.

ANSWER called for national anti-war, pro-Palestinian, and anti-Haitian coup demonstrations on March 20, 2004, (the first anniversary of the invasion of Iraq). The protest in New York, cosponsored by UFPJ, was attended by 100,000 according to the ANSWER website. ANSWER participated in the March for Women&#x27;s Lives on April 25, and the protests of the 2004 Republican National Convention from August 30 to September 2.

=== 2005–06 ===
ANSWER and UFPJ jointly sponsored a rally in Washington, D.C., on September 24, 2005, with attendance estimated by police at 150,000 and by organizers at 300,000 people.

ANSWER was involved with demonstrations on May Day, 2006, in support of rights for undocumented immigrants, which brought out several million people across the U.S. These protests were organized by a number of groups unrelated to ANSWER as well.

In late June 2006, ANSWER organized and participated in local rallies against the Israeli invasion of Gaza. Shortly after Israel invaded Lebanon two weeks later, ANSWER—along with the National Council of Arab Americans and the Muslim American Society—initiated a call for protests on August 12, 2006, against the &quot;U.S.-Israeli War on the People of Lebanon and Palestine.&quot; Organizers estimated that the August 12 demonstrations drew 30,000 protesters in Washington, 10,000 in San Francisco, and 5,000 in Los Angeles.

=== 2007–2010 ===

ANSWER called national antiwar demonstrations in San Francisco and Washington, D.C., for September 15, 2007. According to the group, the attendance was 100,000.

ANSWER joined with other groups to organize the March 20, 2010 anti-war protest in Washington, D.C.

=== 2010–2020 ===
In response to the escalating tensions in Iraq between U.S. military and diplomats and Iraqi shia militias in correspondence with Iran, ANSWER called for a national demonstration against war in Iraq and aggression against Iran. The call for the demonstrations was made public via social media on January 1, 2020, but the importance of the proposed demonstrations on January 3, 2020, when the U.S. targeted and bombed a convoy of vehicles in the Baghdad International Airport, killing the Iranian general Qasem Soleimani and several key figures in the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces, including the militia&#x27;s Deputy Chairman Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. On January 4, 2020, over 70 demonstrations, led by ANSWER and other organizations in coordination with ANSWER, took place across the United States. Demonstrations ranged from smaller in size in small cities to large gatherings in cities like New York City and Chicago. The Washington, D.C., demonstration included actress Jane Fonda.

=== Since 2021 ===
ANSWER has increasingly turned its attention to the growing conflict between the U.S. and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Brian Becker, the National Director of the ANSWER Coalition, is an endorser of the organization &quot;Pivot to Peace&quot; mission statement, which is an organization of &quot;concerned Americans from all walks of life who have come together in opposition to the dramatically increasing drive toward confrontation between the United States and China.&quot; They have also worked with &quot;No Cold War&quot; on events, including their webinar, &quot;For a Peaceful Pacific,&quot; which featured ANSWER organizer Derek Ford.

After several Asian women were killed in a hate crime in Atlanta on March 16, 2021, the ANSWER Coalition organized a nationwide day of action to protest the anti-Asian hate crime. ANSWER sees the hate crimes as &quot;the result of the growing hostility towards China&quot;.

In March 2023, the ANSWER Coalition organized demonstrations in Washington, D.C., and other American cities against the &quot;U.S. empire&quot; in commemoration of &quot;the 20th anniversary […] of the criminal U.S.-invasion of Iraq.&quot; The demonstrations&#x27; major theme was protesting American involvement in the Russo-Ukrainian War after Russia&#x27;s full-scale invasion a year earlier. The organization stated that &quot;The Biden administration is determined to escalate the Ukraine war. The real goal of the massive arming and training of Ukrainian forces has nothing to do with the interests of Ukrainian, Russian or American people. The aim instead is to “weaken Russia” as stated by the U.S. Secretary of Defense himself, even at the risk of a catastrophic nuclear war that could end life on Earth.&quot;

In October and November 2023, the ANSWER Coalition joined with other groups such as the Palestinian Youth Movement to organize a series of protests across the USA. Prominent events included protests in New York City and Washington DC.

=== Attendance figures ===
ANSWER figures for the size of its March 2007, protest were higher than corresponding &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; figures. ANSWER engaged in a public dispute with the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; about the size of that demonstration. ANSWER Western Regional Coordinator Richard Becker wrote in an op-ed:

While tens of thousands of spirited anti-war marchers were still entering the San Francisco Civic Center on Sunday, March 18... organizers got word that a &quot;Chronicle&quot; reporter covering the event had already determined that only 3,000 people were present... Mainstream media undercounting of progressive demonstrations is nothing new, but this one had a magician&#x27;s touch.

Analyzing the width and pace of the march together with the time required for the march to pass a certain point, Becker argues that the &quot;Chronicle&quot;″s estimate is &quot;impossible.&quot;

Some on the left have also accused ANSWER of exaggerating protest attendance. An October 2007 &quot;Socialist Worker&quot; editorial penned by Todd Chretien and republished on &quot;CounterPunch&quot; asserted: &quot;Ask anyone who has worked with ANSWER, and they will tell you that its organizers always double the number of people at their marches. More recently, the multiplication factor has increased.&quot; Chretien describes this as &quot;disorienting for the movement.&quot;

==Controversies==
=== Relationships within the anti-war movement ===
For much of its history, few other prominent antiwar groups in the U.S. or elsewhere have had formal relationships with ANSWER, although many have participated in major ANSWER-sponsored protests.

During the protests against the U.S.-led invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, there was much discussion among U.S. leftist opponents of those invasions, as to the degree to which they are or are not willing to work with ANSWER because of its affiliations.

Michael Albert and Stephen R. Shalom writing in &quot;Z magazine&quot; argue that regardless of the political views of some speakers at a major antiwar demonstration, &quot;as long as other speakers can and do express positions with a different point of view, the overall impact of the event will still be positive, particularly in the absence of other options. Most of the people at the demonstration will in fact be unaware of exactly who said what and whether any particular speaker omitted this or that point. What they will experience will be a powerful antiwar protest. And most of the public will see it that way too.&quot;

==== Break with UFPJ ====
Although ANSWER worked with United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ) to build the September 24, 2005, Washington, D.C. rally, a December 2005 statement by the UFPJ Steering Committee says that UFPJ &quot;has decided not to coordinate work with ANSWER again on a national level. The document cites three reasons for the decision:
# ANSWER did not honor the agreed-upon time limits for its sections of the pre-march Rally...
# ANSWER delayed the start of the March... and
# ANSWER did not turn out many volunteers.&quot;

The document says that the UFPJ Steering Committee &quot;did not have consensus&quot; about the decision not to work with ANSWER, but had &quot;a more than two thirds supermajority ... We make no recommendations or mandates on this issue to UFPJ member groups in local or constituency-based area...&quot;

ANSWER responded by saying that &quot;UFPJ has publicly proclaimed its intention to split the movement,&quot; and accused UFPJ of &quot;a false and ugly attack on the ANSWER Coalition,&quot; and of doing so for &quot;embarrassingly petty and astonishingly trivial&quot; reasons. Besides giving their own version of the events surrounding September 24, ANSWER&#x27;s statement indicates some less trivial differences between the groups: they criticize UFPJ for its willingness to support the ideas of mainstream politicians, such as John Murtha, who are disaffected with the war, while ANSWER &quot;considers it harmful to try to tailor the message of the progressive movement to please the long-awaited but fictional support from the politicians.&quot; ANSWER asks, &quot;Why is it that UFPJ&#x27;s leadership can build a gushing &quot;united front&quot; with imperialist politicians but not the ANSWER Coalition, which has organized hundreds of thousands of people to promote genuine peace and self-determination?&quot;

At considerable length, ANSWER argued that the current split has historical roots, dating back to &quot;the first Iraq war of 1990–1991, [when] some of the same leadership forces now in UFPJ chose to create a second antiwar coalition and insisted on marching under the banner &quot;Economic Sanctions Not War&quot; while some of those who are today in the leadership of ANSWER argued that economic sanctions were war—and a weapon of mass destruction at that. We contended that economic sanctions against Iraq would result in a form of genocide against the Iraqi people and that the only correct position for the U.S. antiwar movement was to demand, &#x27;No war against Iraq.&#x27;... The economic sanctions ultimately took the lives of more than one million Iraqis, most of them children under the age of five, according to the UN&#x27;s own statistics... The question for the antiwar movement is this: are we building a movement that comprehensively challenges imperialism or are we opposed only to certain tactics employed by imperialism such as overt, unilateral military invasion?&quot;

Regarding the prospects of working again with UFPJ, ANSWER wrote, &quot;[we regard] the united front that was formed at [our] initiative to have been remarkably successful,&quot; and later, &quot;Different groups may have different slogans on their banners, but they should try to overcome the forces of division so as to march shoulder to shoulder against the real enemy.&quot;

Although the language of the UFPJ Steering Committee statement makes the break appear definitive, they have published similar statements (rejecting future work with ANSWER) in the past, only to later agree to united demonstrations. A May 2005 decision to the same effect—announcing a September 24 demonstration separate from the one initiated by ANSWER—was reversed when UFPJ agreed to a united antiwar demonstration. Previous united demonstrations between the two groups took place on October 25, 2003, and March 20, 2004.

=== Anti-Zionism and allegations of antisemitism ===
The Anti-Defamation League has criticized ANSWER for its support of Hezbollah and Hamas and of attacks on Israelis by those and other groups, as well as its anti-Zionist stance. It also characterized ANSWER as fostering an anti-Semitic environment at some of its rallies, citing examples of signs held by attendees promoting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and demonizing Israel. The Stephen Roth Institute has said &quot;Anti-Israel and antisemitic content has marked some ANSWER events.&quot;

The May–June 2003 issue of &quot;Tikkun&quot;, a progressive magazine of Jewish interests, contained a special section entitled &quot;Authoritarianism and Anti-Semitism in the Anti-War Movement?&quot; According to &quot;Tikkun&quot;, &quot;many Jews report that they were encountering what they perceived to be anti-Semitism at anti-war demonstrations organized by International A.N.S.W.E.R.&quot; &quot;Tikkun&quot; described the perceptions of anti-Semitism as based on Israel being singled out for criticism and A.N.S.W.E.R.&#x27;s refusal to &quot;acknowledge or support the right of the Jewish people to national self-determination.&quot;

According to A.N.S.W.E.R.: &quot;There are those within the Jewish political establishment who charge anti-Semitism against any who dare condemn these terrible acts, or who condemn Israel fundamentally. But being opposed to Zionism is not the same as being anti-Semitic.&quot;

ANSWER works with Jewish Voice for Peace and other Jewish groups opposed to Israel.

=== Immigration and May Day 2006 ===
In addition to anti-war activism, ANSWER is involved in advocacy for rights for undocumented immigrants, believing that all immigration should be legal. ANSWER became involved in immigrant rights activism through protests against Save Our State, a California-based anti-undocumented immigration protest group, and the Minutemen Project, a group which patrols the U.S.-Mexico border to prevent illegal border crossings, and which ANSWER views as practicing racist vigilantism. These protests began soon after the founding of the Minutemen group in April 2005. ANSWER has not usually been the primary organizer of these protests but has actively supported them. For example, ANSWER helped organize counter-protests of rallies held by right-wing groups in Alhambra, California, on June 21, 2005; in Sacramento, California, on August 29, 2005; in Los Angeles on January 7, 2006; and in Burbank, California, on January 21, 2006.

ANSWER has also been involved in the much larger demonstrations in opposition to the Sensenbrenner Bill and support of legalization for undocumented immigrants that have occurred across the United States since March 2006. ANSWER was not the primary organizer of the initial large protests in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Dallas in late March and early April, but endorsed them. ANSWER was more prominent in the promotion of a May Day &quot;Day Without An Immigrant&quot; strike and boycott, because this call was controversial within the immigrant rights movement, contributing to a growing division between its left-wing advocates and moderates who believed a strike and boycott would be counterproductive.

ANSWER&#x27;s position on the left side of this issue led to criticism; Jaime Contreras, president of the National Capital Immigrant Coalition and chairman of the local Service Employees International Union in Washington, D.C., told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; regarding ANSWER: &quot;Groups... that have done nothing on immigration have no reason to stick their nose where it doesn&#x27;t belong... They have no business saying, &#x27;Let&#x27;s do a strike&#x27; when it will create a humongous burden on immigrant groups. They need to stay in their box.&quot; Brian Becker, ANSWER&#x27;s national coordinator, responded that ANSWER has in fact been involved in immigration in the long term, and that &quot;We are just part of the coalition; we are not spearheading it at all... Whatever the immigrant rights community calls for is what we support.&quot;

=== Conflict with D.C. city government over posters ===
In August 2007, the D.C. Department of Public Works claimed that ANSWER broke city ordinances by putting signs, advertising a September 15 antiwar march, on utility boxes and using an adhesive that is difficult to remove. Additionally, the National Park Service, which administers many of the parks in the District of Columbia, claimed that the signs were defacement of federal property and ordered the group to remove the signs or pay for their removal. ANSWER refused to remove the signs, stating that the adhesive used was legal, water-soluble paste and the city&#x27;s actions were &quot;politically motivated.&quot; The group said any fines would be without legal basis, and they would appeal if fines were imposed. ANSWER sued the city in federal court to stop the city from enforcing its laws until it creates a &quot;constitutionally allowable and non-discriminating system&quot; for determining the rules on sign posting. An ANSWER spokeswoman stated that they gained support from the publicity and intended to continue to post more posters, stickers, and banners despite the efforts of the city.

<text>Safsaf ( &quot;Ṣafṣāf&quot;, &quot;weeping willow&quot;) was a Palestinian village 9 kilometres northwest of Safed, present-day Israel. Its villagers fled to Lebanon after the Safsaf massacre in October 1948, during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

==History==
The village was called Safsofa in Roman times.

According to Yaqut, it was harried in 950 CE by the Hamdanid ruler of Aleppo, Sayf al-Dawla.

===Ottoman era===
In the early sixteenth century CE, Safsaf was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire, and by the 1596 tax records, it was a village in the &quot;nahiyah&quot; (&quot;subdistrict&quot;) of Jira, part of Sanjak Safad. It had a population of 25 households, an estimated 138 persons, all Muslim. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on several agricultural items, including wheat, barley, olives and fruits, as well as other types of produce, such as beehives and goats; a total of 3,714 akçe. A quarter of the revenue went to a waqf (religious endowment). 

In 1838 Safsaf was noted as a village in the Safad district, while in 1875 Victor Guérin described it as a village with fifteen Muslim families. 

In 1881 the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described Safsaf as a small village situated on a plain, with a population of about 100. They also noted that &quot;ornamented stones of a preexisting public building&quot; had been built into the doorway of the village mosque. The villagers cultivated olive and fig trees and vineyards.

A population list from about 1887 showed Safsaf to have about 740 inhabitants, all Muslim. At this time it was part of Beirut vilayet. 

===British Mandate era===
Safsaf became a part of the British Mandate in 1922. During this time, the village lay on the eastern side of the Safad-Tarshiha highway and extended in a northeast–southwest direction. All the residents of Safsaf were Muslims. A mosque and several shops were located in the village center, and an elementary school was established during this period. Agriculture was the main economic activity, and it was both irrigated from springs and rainfed. Fruits and olives were cultivated on the land north of the village. 

In the 1922 census of Palestine Safsaf had a population of 521 Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 662, still all Muslims, in a total of 124 houses.
In the 1945 statistics the population was 910 Muslims, with a total of 7,391 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, a total of 2,586 dunums were allotted to cereals; 769 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards, while a 72 dunams was built-up (urban) area.

===1948, and aftermath===

On October 29, 1948, Israeli forces assaulted the village as part of Operation Hiram. After the villagers surrendered, some 50-70 men were massacred while bound and four women reported being raped. The IDF records for this massacre remain classified.

In 1949 Kfar Hoshen was established on village land, followed by Bar Yohai in 1979, also on village land.

In 1992 the village site was described: &quot;The site is overgrown with grass and scattered trees among which can be seen a few terraces and piles of stones from destroyed houses. A few houses are inhabited by Israelis. A fraction of surrounding land is cultivated by the settlements, and the rest is forested.&quot;

<doc id="268331" wikidata="Q335024" url="?curid=268331" title="Saponification">
<text>Saponification is a process of cleaving esters into carboxylate salts and alcohols by the action of aqueous alkali. Typically aqueous sodium hydroxide solutions are used. It is an important type of alkaline hydrolysis. When the carboxylate is long chain, its salt is called a soap. The saponification of ethyl acetate gives sodium acetate and ethanol:

== Saponification of fats ==
Vegetable oils and animal fats are the traditional materials that are saponified. These greasy materials, triesters called triglycerides, are usually mixtures derived from diverse fatty acids. In the traditional saponification, the triglyceride is treated with lye, which cleaves the ester bonds, releasing fatty acid salts (soaps) and glycerol. In one simplified version, the saponification of stearin gives sodium stearate.
This process is the main industrial method for producing glycerol (). 

Some soap-makers leave the glycerol in the soap. Others precipitate the soap by salting it out with sodium chloride.
Fat in a corpse converts into adipocere, often called &quot;grave wax&quot;. This process is more common where the amount of fatty tissue is high and the agents of decomposition are absent or only minutely present.

=== Saponification value ===

The saponification value is the amount of base required to saponify a fat sample. Soap makers formulate their recipes with a small deficit of lye to account for the unknown deviation of saponification value between their oil batch and laboratory averages.

=== Mechanism of basic hydrolysis ===

The hydroxide anion adds to the carbonyl group of the ester. The immediate product is called an orthoester.
Expulsion of the alkoxide generates a carboxylic acid:
The alkoxide ion is a strong base so the proton is transferred from the carboxylic acid to the alkoxide ion, creating an alcohol:

In a classic laboratory procedure, the triglyceride trimyristin is obtained by extracting it from nutmeg with diethyl ether. Saponification to the soap sodium myristate takes place using NaOH in water. Treating the soap with hydrochloric acid gives myristic acid.

== Saponification of fatty acids ==
The reaction of fatty acids with base is the other main method of saponification. In this case, the reaction involves neutralization of the carboxylic acid. The neutralization method is used to produce industrial soaps such as those derived from magnesium, the transition metals, and aluminium. This method is ideal for producing soaps that are derived from a single fatty acid, which leads to soaps with predictable physical properties, as required by many engineering applications.

== Applications ==
=== Hard and soft soaps ===
Depending on the nature of the alkali used in their production, soaps have distinct properties. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) produces &quot;hard&quot; soaps; hard soaps can also be used in water containing Mg, Cl, and Ca salts. By contrast, potassium soaps (derived using KOH) are &quot;soft&quot; soaps. The fatty acid source also affects the soap&#x27;s melting point. Most early hard soaps were manufactured using animal fats and KOH extracted from wood ash; these were broadly solid. However, the majority of modern soaps are manufactured from polyunsaturated triglycerides such as vegetable oils. As in the triglycerides they are formed from the salts of these acids have weaker inter-molecular forces and thus lower melting points.

=== Lithium soaps ===
Lithium 12-hydroxystearate and other lithium-based fatty acids are important constituents of lubricating greases. In lithium-based greases, lithium carboxylates are thickeners. &quot;Complex soaps&quot; are also common, these being combinations of more than one acid salt, such as azelaic or acetic acid.

=== Fire extinguishers ===
Fires involving cooking fats and oils (classified as class K (US) or F (Australia/Europe/Asia)) burn hotter than most flammable liquids, rendering a standard class B extinguisher ineffective. Such fires should be extinguished with a wet chemical extinguisher. Extinguishers of this type are designed to extinguish cooking fats and oils through saponification. The extinguishing agent rapidly converts the burning substance to a non-combustible soap.

== Oil paints ==

Saponification can occur in oil paintings over time, causing visible damage and deformation. Oil paints are composed of pigment molecules suspended in an oil-binding medium. Heavy metal salts are often used as pigment molecules, such as in lead white, red lead, and zinc white. If those heavy metal salts react with free fatty acids in the oil medium, metal soaps may form in a paint layer that can then migrate outward to the painting&#x27;s surface.

Saponification in oil paintings was described as early as 1912. It is believed to be widespread, having been observed in many works dating from the fifteenth through the twentieth centuries; works of different geographic origin; and works painted on various supports, such as canvas, paper, wood, and copper. Chemical analysis may reveal saponification occurring in a painting&#x27;s deeper layers before any signs are visible on the surface, even in paintings centuries old.

The saponified regions may deform the painting&#x27;s surface through the formation of visible lumps or protrusions that can scatter light. These soap lumps may be prominent only on certain regions of the painting rather than throughout. In John Singer Sargent&#x27;s famous &quot;Portrait of Madame X&quot;, for example, the lumps only appear on the blackest areas, which may be because of the artist&#x27;s use of more medium in those areas to compensate for the tendency of black pigments to soak it up. The process can also form chalky white deposits on a painting&#x27;s surface, a deformation often described as &quot;blooming&quot; or &quot;efflorescence&quot;, and may also contribute to the increased transparency of certain paint layers within an oil painting over time.

Saponification does not occur in all oil paintings and many details are unresolved. At present, retouching is the only known restoration method.

<doc id="268332" wikidata="Q388563" url="?curid=268332" title="Northwest Arkansas National Airport">
<text>Northwest Arkansas National Airport in Northwest Arkansas is a public-use airport located in Benton County, Arkansas, serving the rapidly growing Northwest Arkansas region, northwest of Fayetteville and northwest of Springdale. Since its opening in 1998, XNA has become a vital transportation hub, reflecting the area&#x27;s economic expansion and increasing travel demands.

XNA covers 2,680 acres (1,085 ha) of land and has two parallel 8,800 foot (2,682 m) runways.

XNA&#x27;s operations benefit significantly from its proximity to the headquarters of major corporations, including Walmart in Bentonville, Tyson Foods in Springdale, and J.B. Hunt Transport Services in Lowell. The airport is also frequently utilized by athletic teams from the University of Arkansas for away games and by Razorback opponents visiting Fayetteville.

XNA is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2019–2023, in which it is categorized as a small-hub primary commercial service facility.

==History==
The establishment of XNA was driven by the need to accommodate the region&#x27;s growing population and economic activities. Prior to XNA, Drake Field in Fayetteville was the primary airport, but its operational limitations prompted the search for a more capable facility. In 1990, the Northwest Arkansas Council, a private, non-profit organization, was formed with Alice L. Walton as its first chairperson. Under her leadership, the Council initiated efforts that led to the creation of the Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport Authority, which included representatives from Bentonville, Fayetteville, Rogers, Siloam Springs, Springdale, and Benton and Washington counties. This collaborative approach culminated in the opening of XNA on November 1, 1998, featuring a single terminal and runway.

In 2023, the Arkansas General Assembly passed legislation allowing regional airport authorities to detach from municipalities without requiring annexation by another municipality. Consequently, on September 19, 2023, XNA initiated the process to detach from the city of Highfill, aiming for equitable regional benefit for all five cities and two counties.

In 2024, XNA set a record, surpassing 2 million passengers for the first time, with 2,293,352 passengers served.

===Expansion===
In 2007, airport officials announced the construction of a new concourse costing between $20 million and $25 million. The new facility, east of the upper concourse, has allowed the airport to increase its number of airplane parking positions from twelve to twenty. Building the new facility took over three years.

The airport completed a ticket counter expansion in 2010. The airport has completed a $21 million expansion to the upper-level concourse that includes the state&#x27;s first moving walkway. With the walkway, it is anticipated to take about three minutes to get from security to the last gate. The addition adds and twelve upper-level gates to the east side of the airport.

The airport was previously known as Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport. It adopted the name Northwest Arkansas National Airport in December 2019. Airport officials attributed the change to perception, saying that the new name would help attract more airline service.
On September 23, 2021, it was announced that Board members took the first steps toward adding a second concourse. The board voted to have staff negotiate with Fentress Architects for conceptual drawings for the first phase of Concourse B. The design work will cost about $185,000. The new concourse would allow the airport to use its boarding gates more efficiently. The Board are contemplating bringing some gates on Concourse A back into use for certain aircraft sizes and redesigning others. Phase One would include an elevated walkway, a hold room for passengers and a covered walkway out to a ground-level loading area onto the aircraft. Construction of the project is estimated to cost roughly $35 million to $50 million. Longer range plans call for building out Concourse B to roughly match Concourse A.

In 2023, the airport began a Terminal Modernization Project designed to enhance passenger experience and accommodate growing demand. Key elements of this project include:

* Updated baggage claims with upgraded conveyor systems.
* New elevators, escalators, and stairwells to improve accessibility and increase vertical redundancy of passenger flow.
* Redesigned pick-up and drop-off areas, with additional traffic lanes for better flow.
Recognizing the need for upgraded infrastructure, the airport began construction of a new air traffic control tower in June 2024. The new tower will replace the existing 57-foot structure, which was originally intended as a temporary solution when the airport opened in 1998.

The new tower will stand at 141 feet to the top of the cab, significantly improving visibility and operational efficiency for air traffic controllers. The enhanced height and modern features of the new tower will enable XNA to better handle increasing air traffic volumes as the region continues to grow.

At present, excluding Robinson Maneuver Training Center and Little Rock Air Force Base, two military facilities, XNA is the largest commercial/public/general aviation airport in terms of land area (2,680 acres, 4.2 sq.mi.) in the state of Arkansas.

===Runway===
The original runway built in 1998 required complete reconstruction in 2011, following the discovery of alkali-silica reaction (ASR) in its Portland cement concrete. Since the runway was the only one at the airport, a temporary runway was necessary to maintain service during reconstruction. Stimulus funds of $9 million ($ million in today&#x27;s dollars) from the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) allowed XNA to accelerate the alternative runway construction project. Upon completion of the alternate runway in 2012, all aircraft operations were shifted to the new surface and demolition and replacement of the primary runway began.

===Access Road===
Construction officially began on a four-lane interstate-standard access road on April 17, 2024. Managed by the Arkansas Department of Transportation (ArDOT), the project will be a four-lane highway, extending approximately 4 miles from the airport entrance at Highway 264 to Highway 612, also known as the Springdale Bypass. Once completed, the road will provide a much-needed connection to the airport, improving travel times and accessibility for passengers and businesses in the region.

The need for this access road has been discussed for more than two decades. This project is expected to greatly improve safety, reducing the number of accidents caused by heavy traffic on narrow, rural routes leading to the airport.

The access road is scheduled for completion in 2027.

==Facilities==

The airport covers 2,680 acres (1,085 ha) at an elevation of 1,288 feet (393 m). It has two runways, 16R/34L and 16L/34R. 16L/34R is 8,801 feet long by 150 feet (2,683 x 46 m) wide and 16R/34L is 8,800 feet long by 150 feet (2,682 x 46 m) wide.

In the year ending June 30, 2023, the airport had 46,510 aircraft operations, average 127 per day: 49% airline, 12% air taxi, 25% military, and 14% general aviation. In June 2023, 12 aircraft were based at the airport: 3 single-engine, and 9 jet.

<text>Moshe Carmel (, 17 January 1911 – 14 August 2003) was an Israeli Major-General and politician who served as Minister of Transportation for eight years.

==Biography==
Born in Mińsk Mazowiecki in the Russian Empire (today in Poland), Carmel emigrated to Mandate Palestine in 1924 when he was 13 years old. He was a founding member of kibbutz Na&#x27;an, and was active in the HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed youth movement. Between 1939 and 1941 he was imprisoned by the British authorities. During the 1948 Palestine war, he was commander of the Carmeli Brigade, participating in the Battle of Haifa and Operation Hiram.

He was elected to the third Knesset in 1955 as a member of Ahdut HaAvoda and was appointed Minister of Transportation. On 28 September 1956 he flew to Paris with Moshe Dayan, Shimon Peres and Golda Meir where they had meetings with French Foreign Minister Christian Pineau. The purpose of the meetings was &#x27;to clarify ... the possibilities of joint action against Egypt&#x27;.

On 29 October 1957 he suffered a broken arm after a Mills grenade was thrown into the debating chamber of the Knesset. David Ben-Gurion and Golda Meir were also injured. The attack was carried out by Moshe Dwek, whose motives were attributed to a dispute with the Jewish Agency, though he was also described as &#x27;mentally unbalanced&#x27;. He retained his seat in the 1959 and 1961 elections, and was reappointed Minister of Transportation towards the end of the fifth Knesset in 1965. When Ahdut HaAvoda merged with Mapai to form the Alignment, Carmel joined the new party and retained his ministerial post in the sixth Knesset.

Carmel remained a Knesset member until 1977, and published two books; &quot;Northern Campaigns&quot; (1949) and &quot;Between the Walls&quot; (1965). He died in 2003 at the age of 92.

<text>Johann Christian Wilhelm Augusti (27 October 1772 – 28 April 1841) was a German theologian.

==Life==
He was born at Eschenbergen, near Gotha, Augusti was of Jewish descent, his grandfather having been a converted rabbi. He was educated at the &quot;gymnasium&quot; of Gotha and the University of Jena. At Jena he studied oriental languages, of which he became a professor there in 1803. Subsequently, he was professor of theology (1812), and for a time rector, at the University of Breslau. In 1819 he transferred as a professor of theology to the University of Bonn. In 1828 he was appointed chief member of the consistorial council at Koblenz. There he was afterwards made director of the Rhenish Consistory of the Evangelical Church in Prussia. He died at Koblenz. 

Augusti had little sympathy with the modern philosophical interpretations of dogma, and he held to the traditional faith. His works on theology (&quot;Lehrbuch Der Christlichen Dogmengeschichte&quot;, 1805) are simple statements of fact; they do not attempt a speculative treatment of their subjects. In 1809 he published in conjunction with WML de Wette a new translation of the Old Testament. His other works include, &quot;Grundriss einer historisch-kritischen Einleitung in&#x27;s Alte Testament&quot; (1806), &quot;Exegetisches Handbuch des Alten Testaments&quot; (1797–1800) and an edition of &quot;Die Apochryphen des A. T.&quot; (1804).

In addition to these, his most important writings are the &quot;Denkwürdigkeiten aus der Christlichen Archäologie&quot;, 12 vols. (1817–1831), a partially digested class of materials, and the &quot;Handbuch der christlichen Archäologie&quot;, (1836–1837), which gives the substance of the larger work in a more compact and systematic form.

<text>The Assyrian Church of the East (ACOE), sometimes called the Church of the East and officially known as the Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East, is an Eastern Christian church that follows the traditional Christology and ecclesiology of the historical Church of the East. It belongs to the eastern branch of Syriac Christianity, and employs the Divine Liturgy of Saints Addai and Mari belonging to the East Syriac Rite. Its main liturgical language is Classical Syriac, a dialect of Eastern Aramaic.
The Assyrian Church of the East is officially headquartered in the city of Erbil, in northern Iraq; its original area encompassed Iraq, southeastern Turkey, northeastern Syria and northwestern Iran, corresponding roughly to ancient Assyria. The current Catholicos-Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East, Mar Awa III, was consecrated in September 2021.

The Assyrian Church of the East claims continuity with the historical Church of the East, and is not in communion with the Catholic, Oriental Orthodox or Eastern Orthodox churches. The faction of the original Church of the East which came into full communion with the Holy See of Rome is the Chaldean Catholic Church, whose members are mostly ethnic Assyrians. After the Common Christological Declaration in 1994 between the Church of the East and the Catholic Church, and a 2001 theological dialogue between the churches, they drew up guidelines for the faithful to have mutual admission to the Eucharist between the Chaldean Catholic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East.

The Assyrian Church of the East has a traditional episcopal structure, headed by the Catholicos-Patriarch. Its hierarchy is composed of metropolitan bishops and diocesan bishops, while lower clergy consists of priests and deacons, who serve in dioceses (eparchies) and parishes throughout the Western Asia, India, North America, Oceania, and Europe (including the Caucasus and Russia).

==History==

The Assyrian Church of the East considers itself as the continuation of the Church of the East, a church that originally developed among the Assyrians during the first century AD in Assyria, Upper Mesopotamia and northwestern Persia, east of the Byzantine Empire. It is an apostolic church established by Thomas the Apostle, Addai of Edessa, and Bartholomew the Apostle.

The historical distinctiveness of the Assyrian Church of the East resulted from the series of complex processes and events that occurred within the Church of the East during the transitional period that started in the middle of the 16th century, and lasted until the beginning of the 19th century. That turbulent period was marked by several consequent splits and mergers, resulting in the creation of separate branches and rival patriarchal lines. During the entire period, one of the main questions of dispute was the union with the Catholic Church. Ultimately, the pro-Catholic branches were consolidated as the Chaldean Catholic Church, while the traditional branches were consolidated as the Assyrian Church of the East.

===Schisms and branches===
During the patriarchal tenure of Shemon VII Ishoyahb (1539–1558), who resided in the ancient Rabban Hormizd Monastery near Alqosh, an internal dissent occurred over several issues, including the question of hereditary succession to the patriarchal throne, and the question of union with the Catholic Church. By that time, Franciscan missionaries had already gained some influence over several local communities, and they took an active role in organizing the opposition to the Patriarch at that time. By the end of 1552, a pro-Catholic party had been organized in Mosul under the leadership of the priest Yohannan Sulaqa, who decided to legitimize his position by traveling to Rome and seeking confirmation by Pope Julius III (1550–1555).

Receiving support from the Franciscan missionaries, he arrived in Rome and entered into full communion with the Catholic Church in February 1553. At that point, officials of the Roman Curia were given incorrect information that the elderly Patriarch Shemon VII had actually died. After some deliberation, the Pope decided to appoint Yohannan Sulaqa as &quot;Patriarch of Babylon&quot; and named the breakaway Church as &#x27;The Church of Assyria and Mosul&quot; in April 1553.

Upon consecration, Yohannan Sulaqa took the name &quot;Shimun&quot; and by the end of the year he returned to his homeland. He started to organize the pro-Catholic party by appointing several metropolitans and bishops.

===The senior Eliya line of Alqosh===

Union with Rome was actively opposed by Patriarch Shemon VII Ishoyahb, who continued to reside in the Rabban Hormizd Monastery near the ancient Assyrian town of Alqosh. He was succeeded by his nephew Eliya (1558–1591), who was designated as Eliya &quot;VII&quot; in older historiography, but renumbered as Eliya &quot;VI&quot; in recent scholarly works. The same renumbering was applied to his successors, who all took the same name thus creating the &quot;Eliya line&quot;. During his patriarchal rule, the &quot;Eliya line&quot; preserved its traditional christology and full ecclesiastical independence. His successor was Patriarch Eliya VII (VIII) (1591–1617), who negotiated on several occasions with the Catholic Church, in 1605 and 1610, and again in 1615–1616, but without any conclusion. Further negotiations were abandoned by the next Patriarch Eliya VIII (IX) (1617–1660). David Wilmshurst noted that his successor, Patriarch Eliya IX (X) (1660–1700) also was a &quot;vigorous defender of the traditional faith&quot;.

The Eliya line of traditionalist Patriarchs continued throughout the entire 18th century, residing in the ancient Monastery of Rabban Hormizd, which was eventually attacked and looted by muslim Turks in 1743, at the beginning of the Ottoman–Persian War (1743–1746). Faced with a centuries-old rivalry and frequent conflicts between two mighty Islamic empires (Ottoman and Persian), all Christian communities in the bordering regions were constantly exposed to danger – and not only in the times of war, since local, mainly Kurdish, warlords were accustomed to attacking Assyrian and Armenian Christian communities and monasteries and taking their land, often with Ottoman support. Patriarchs Eliya X (XI) (1700–1722) and Eliya XI (XII) (1722–1778) tried to improve the increasingly worsening position of their Christian flock by staying loyal to Ottoman authorities, but the local administration was frequently unable to provide effective protection. The Eliya line of traditionalist Patriarchs ended in 1804 with the death of Eliya XII (XIII) (1778–1804).

===The junior Shimun line of Qochanis===
During the second half of the 16th century, traditionalist patriarchs of the Eliya line were faced with the continuous presence of the pro-Catholic movement, led by successors of Shimun VIII Yohannan Sulaqa. After his death in 1555, the newly established line of patriarchs who were united with the Catholic Church was continued by Abdisho IV Maron (1555–1570), who remained in full communion with the Catholic Church. He visited Rome and was officially confirmed by the Pope of Rome in 1562. Soon after his death, connections with Rome were weakened for the first time during the tenure of Patriarch Yahballaha IV who did not seek confirmation from the Pope. That interlude was ended by his successor Shimun IX Dinkha (1580–1600) who restored full communion with the Catholic Church, and was officially confirmed by the Pope in 1584.

After his death, the patriarchal office was made hereditary, and Patriarchs of this line continued to use the name &quot;Shimun&quot;, thus creating the Shimun line. Hereditary succession was not acceptable to Rome, and during the tenure of the next Patriarch Shimun X Eliyah (1600–1638) ties with the Catholic Church were loosened again. In 1616, Shimun X signed a traditional profession of faith that was not accepted by the Pope, leaving the Patriarch without Rome&#x27;s confirmation. His successor Shimun XI Eshuyow (1638–1656) restored communion with the Catholic Church as late as 1653, eventually receiving confirmation from the Pope. By that time, the movement towards full commitment to the traditional faith was constantly growing stronger within the Shimun line. When the next Patriarch Shimun XII Yoalaha decided to send his profession of faith to the Pope, he was deposed by his bishops because of his pro-Catholic attitude. The Pope tried to intervene on his behalf, but without success.

Final resolution of conflicts within the Shimun line occurred under the next Patriarch Shimun XIII Dinkha (1662–1700), who definitively broke communion with the Catholic Church. In 1670, he gave a traditionalist reply to an approach that was made from the Pope, and by 1672 all connections with the Catholic Church were terminated. At the same time, Patriarch Shimun XIII moved his seat from Amid to Qochanis. After the final return to the traditional faith, Patriarchs of the Shimun line decided to keep their independence and after that time there were two independent lines of traditional patriarchs: the senior Eliya line in Alqosh and the junior Shimun line in Qochanis.

Such division was additionally caused by the complex structure of local Assyrian communities, traditionally organized as tribal confederations with each tribe being headed by a local lord (&quot;malik&quot;), while each &quot;malik&quot; was ultimately subject to the patriarch, who mediated between Christian Assyrians and the Ottoman authorities.

===Consolidation of remaining branches===
In 1780, at the beginning of the patriarchal tenure of Eliya XII (XIII) (1778–1804), a group seceded from the Eliya line in Alqosh and elected Yohannan Hormizd, who entered full communion with the Catholic Church and was officially appointed Archbishop of Mosul and patriarchal administrator of the Chaldean Catholic Church, in 1783. Only after the death in 1827 of the last representative of the Josephite line, Joseph V Augustine Hindi, was Yohannan recognized as the Chaldean Catholic Patriarch by the Pope, in 1830. By this official appointment, the final merger of various factions committed to the union with the Catholic Church was achieved, thus forming the modern Chaldean Catholic Church.

At the same time, the long coexistence and rivalry between two traditionalist patriarchal branches — the senior Eliya line of Alqosh and the junior Shimun line of Qochanis — ended in 1804 when the last primate of the Eliya line, Patriarch Eliya XII (XIII) died and was buried in the ancient Rabban Hormizd Monastery. His branch decided not to elect a new patriarch, thus enabling the remaining patriarch Shimun XVI Yohannan (1780–1820) of the Shimun line to become the sole primate of both Assyrian traditionalist branches. Consolidated after 1804, the reunited traditionalist Church led by patriarchs of the Shimun line became widely known as the &quot;Assyrian Church of the East&quot;. Still based in Qodchanis, Assyrian Patriarch Shimun XVI Yohannan was not able to secure control over the traditional seat of the former Eliya line in the ancient Rabban Hormizd Monastery; and around 1808 that venerated monastic institution passed to the Chaldean Catholics.

The next Assyrian Patriarch Shimun XVII Abraham (1820–1861) also governed his church from Qodshanis. During years marked by political turbulence, he tried to maintain good relations with the local Ottoman authorities. In 1843, he was faced with renewed hostilities from Kurdish warlords, who attacked and looted many Christian villages, killing 10,000 Christian men and taking away women and children as captives. The patriarch himself was forced to take temporary refuge in Mosul. He was succeeded by Patriarch Shimun XVIII Rubil (1861–1903) who also resided in Qodshanis. In 1869, he received an open invitation from the Vatican to visit Rome to attend the First Vatican Council as an observer, but he did not accept the invitation, In following years, he also rejected other initiatives for union with the Catholic Church.
By the end of the 19th century, the Assyrian Church of the East consolidated itself as the sole representative of all traditionalist Assyrians. It also managed to secure a certain level of autonomy within the highly complex system of Ottoman local governance in the bordering regions. On several occasions, Assyrian patriarchs refused to enter communion with the Catholic Church or merge with the Chaldean Catholic Church. On the other hand, by the end of the 19th century some of its communities were converted to Protestantism by various western missionaries, while other communities were drawn to Eastern Orthodoxy. That movement was led by Assyrian Bishop Mar Yonan of Supurghan in the region of Urmia who converted to Eastern Orthodoxy in 1898, through the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Urmia.

===20th century===

Among all the tragedies and schisms which thinned the church out, no other was as severe as the Assyrian genocide. At that point the Assyrian Church of the East was based in the mountains of Hakkari, as it had been since 1681. In 1915, The Young Turks invaded the region — despite the Assyrians&#x27; plea of neutrality during the Caucasus campaign by Russia and their Armenian allies — out of fear of an Assyrian independence movement. In response to this, Assyrians of all denominations (the Assyrian Church of the East, the Chaldean Catholic Church, the Syriac Orthodox Church and Assyrian Protestants) entered into a war of independence and allied themselves with the United Kingdom, the Russian Empire and the Armenians against the Ottomans and their Islamic Kurdish, Iranian and Arab allies.

Despite the odds, the Assyrians fought successfully against the Ottomans and their allies for three years throughout southeastern Turkey, northern Iraq, northwestern Iran and northeastern Syria. Eventually, however, they were abandoned by their allies, the Russian Empire and the First Republic of Armenia, due to the Russian Revolution and the collapse of the Armenian defense, leaving the Assyrians vastly outnumbered, surrounded, and cut off from supplies of ammunition and food. During this period, their See at Qodchanis was completely destroyed and the Turks and their Islamic allies massacred all of the Assyrians in the Hakkari Mountains.

Those who survived fled into Iran with what remained of the Assyrian defense under Agha Petros, but they were pursued into Iranian territory despite the fact they were fleeing. Later, in 1918, after the murder of their &quot;de facto&quot; leader and Patriarch Shimun XIX Benyamin and 150 of his followers during a negotiation, fearing further massacres at the hands of the Turks and Kurds, most of the survivors fled by train from Iran into what was to become Iraq. They sought protection under the British mandate there, and joined the already existing indigenous Assyrian communities of both Eastern Orthodox and Catholic rites in the north, where they formed communities in Baghdad, Basra, and other areas.

====Patriarch Shimun XXI Eshai====

In the aftermath of World War I, the British-educated Patriarch Shimun XXI Eshai, born into the line of patriarchs at Qodchanis, had agitated for an independent Assyrian state. Following the end of the British mandate in 1933 and a massacre of Assyrian civilians at Simele by the Iraqi Army, the patriarch was forced to take refuge in Cyprus. There, Shimun petitioned the League of Nations regarding his people&#x27;s fate, but to little avail, and he was consequently barred from entering Syria and Iraq. He traveled through Europe before moving to Chicago in 1940 to join the growing Assyrian diaspora community there.

Due to the church&#x27;s and the general Assyrian community&#x27;s disorganized state as a result of the conflicts of the 20th century, Patriarch Shimun XXI Eshai was forced to reorganize the church&#x27;s structure in the United States. He transferred his residence to San Francisco in 1954, and was able to travel to Iran, Lebanon, Kuwait, and India, where he worked to strengthen the church.

In 1964, the patriarch decreed a number of changes to the church, including liturgical reform, the adoption of the Gregorian calendar, and the shortening of Lent. These changes, combined with Shimun&#x27;s long absence from Iraq, caused a rift in the community there, which led to another schism. In 1968, traditionalists within the church elected Thoma Darmo as a rival patriarch to Shimun XXI Eshai, forming the independent Ancient Church of the East, based in Baghdad, Iraq.

In 1972, Shimun decided to step down as patriarch, and the following year he got married, in contravention to longstanding church custom. This led to a synod in 1973 in which further reforms were introduced, the most significant of which included the permanent abolition of hereditary succession — a practice introduced in the middle of the fifteenth century by Patriarch Shemon IV Basidi (who had died in 1497) — and it was also decided that Shimun should be reinstated. The second matter was supposed to be settled at another synod in 1975; however, Shimun was assassinated in November 1975 by an estranged relative before this could take place.

====Patriarch Dinkha IV====
Almost a year after the death of Shimun, Mar Khnanya Dinkha, Metropolitan of Tehran, convened a synod of seven Assyrian bishops which took place at St Paul&#x27;s Abbey, Alton, in England, from 12 to 17 October 1976. They were joined by two Church of England bishops, representing the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London, and elected Dinkha as the 120th Catholicos-Patriarch of the Church of the East. On 17 October he was consecrated as Dinkha IV at St Barnabas Church, Ealing, in an area where many Assyrians lived.

Dinkha, who was then aged 33, operated his see at Tehran until the Iran–Iraq War of 1980–1988, when he went into exile in the United States and transferred the Patriarchal See to Chicago. Much of his patriarchate had been concerned with tending to the Assyrian diaspora community and with ecumenical efforts to strengthen relations with other churches. On 26 March 2015, Dinkha IV died in the United States, leaving the Assyrian Church of the East in a period of &quot;sede vacante&quot; until 18 September 2015. During that time, Aprem Mooken served as the custodian of the Patriarchate of Seleucia-Ctesiphon.

====Patriarch Gewargis III====

On 18 September 2015, the Holy Synod of the Assyrian Church of the East elected the Metropolitan of Iraq, Jordan, and Russia, Warda Sliwa, to succeed the late Dinkha IV as Catholicos-Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East. On 27 September 2015, he was consecrated as Catholicos-Patriarch in the Cathedral Church of St. John the Baptist, in Erbil, Iraq. Upon his consecration, he assumed the ecclesiastical name Gewargis III.

Church leaders proposed moving the Patriarchal See from Chicago back to Erbil.

There have also been talks of reunification. In the Common Christological Declaration Between the Catholic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East in 1994, the two churches recognized the legitimacy and rightness of each other&#x27;s titles for Mary.

In 2005, the Assyrian Church of the East had about 380,000 members, mostly living in the United States, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey.

====Patriarch Awa III====

On 6 September 2021, Mar Gewargis III formally stepped down as Catholicos-Patriarch during an Extraordinary Session of the Holy Synod of the Assyrian Church of the East, leaving the Patriarchal See vacant. On 8 September 2021, the Holy Synod elected Mar Awa Royel, Bishop of California and Secretary of the Holy Synod, to succeed Mar Gewargis III as the 122nd Catholicos-Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East.

==Doctrine==

Following doctrinal traditions of the ancient Church of the East, the modern Assyrian Church of the East recognizes the first two ecumenical councils: the First Council of Nicaea (325), and the First Council of Constantinople (381). The Assyrian Church follows trinitarian doctrines, expressed in the Nicene Creed, and professes the eternal procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father.

===Christology===
Theologically, the Assyrian Church of the East does not accept doctrinal definitions that were adopted at the Council of Ephesus (431) and the Council of Chalcedon (451), and still adheres to the Church of the East&#x27;s traditional Christology, that is often labeled as Nestorian. The use and exact meaning of that term has been the subject of many debates, not only throughout history but also in modern times, since the Assyrian Church of the East has distinctive views on several Christological questions and claims that its theological doctrines and traditions are essentially Orthodox, while admitting the need for further inter-Christian dialogue that would resolve various questions in the field of comparative Christological terminology.

The Nestorian nature of Assyrian Christianity remains a matter of contention. Elements of Nestorian doctrine were explicitly repudiated by Patriarch Dinkha IV on the occasion of his accession in 1976.

The Christology of the Church of the East has its roots in the Antiochene theological tradition of the early church. The founders of Assyrian theology are Diodorus of Tarsus and Theodore of Mopsuestia, both of whom taught at Antioch. &quot;Antiochene&quot; is a modern designation given to the style of theology associated with the early church at Antioch, as contrasted with the theology of the Church of Alexandria.

Antiochene theology emphasizes Christ&#x27;s humanity and the reality of the moral choices he faced. In order to preserve the impassibility of Christ&#x27;s Divine Nature, the unity of his person is defined in a looser fashion than in the Alexandrian tradition. The normative Christology of the Church of the East was written by Babai the Great (d. 628) during the controversy that followed the 431 Council of Ephesus. Babai held that within Christ there exist two &quot;qnome&quot; (Syriac: ܩܢܘܡܐ / &quot;qnômâ&quot;, a complex term, equivalent for Greek term hypostasis), unmingled, but everlastingly united in the one prosopon (person) of Christ.

The precise Christological teachings of Nestorius are shrouded in obscurity. Wary of Monophysitism, Nestorius rejected Cyril&#x27;s theory of a hypostatic union, proposing instead a much looser concept of prosopic union. Nestorianism has come to mean radical Dyophysitism, in which Christ&#x27;s two natures are eternally separate, though it is doubtful whether Nestorius ever taught such a doctrine. Nestorius&#x27; rejection of the term Theotokos (&#x27;God-bearer&#x27;, or &#x27;Mother of God&#x27;) has traditionally been held as evidence that he asserted the existence of two persons (dyoprosopism) — not merely two natures — in Jesus Christ, but there exists no evidence that Nestorius denied Christ&#x27;s oneness. In the controversy that followed the Council of Ephesus, the term &quot;Nestorian&quot; was applied to all doctrine upholding a strictly Antiochene Christology. In consequence, the Church of the East was labelled Nestorian, though its official Christology was in fact defined by Babai the Great, at the council that was held in 612.

==Liturgy==
The church employs the Syriac dialect of Eastern Aramaic in its liturgy, the East Syriac Rite, which includes three anaphoras, attributed to Addai of Edessa and Mari, Theodore of Mopsuestia and later also Nestorius.

== Iconography ==
In their homes, Christians belonging to the Assyrian Church of the East hang a Christian cross (without the corpus) on the eastern wall of the main room.

The Assyrian Church of the East does not make use of icons, and the interiors of its houses of worship are simple. Iconography has been present in the Church of the East&#x27;s history; opposition to religious images eventually became the norm due to the spread of Islam in the region, which forbade any type of depictions of saints and biblical prophets. Thus, the church was forced to get rid of her icons.

A Nestorian Peshitta Gospel book written in Estrangela, from the 13th century, resides at the State Library of Berlin. This illustrated manuscript from Upper Mesopotamia or Tur Abdin proves that in the 13th century the church was not yet aniconic. The Nestorian Evangelion preserved in the contains an illustration depicting Jesus Christ (not a crucifix) in the circle of a ringed cross (in the form of Celtic cross) surrounded by four angels.

Three Syriac manuscripts from the early 19th century and earlier—they were edited into a compilation titled &quot;The Book of Protection&quot; by Hermann Gollancz—contain a number of illustrations which are more or less crude. These manuscripts prove the continuous use of images. Moreover, a life-size male stucco figure was discovered in a church of Seleucia-Ctesiphon from the late 6th century. Beneath this church were found the remains of an earlier church. Although it cannot be determined which Nestorian Church was involved, the discovery nevertheless proves that the Church of the East also used figurative representations.

==Organization==
The Assyrian Church of the East is governed by an episcopal polity, the same as other apostolic churches. The church maintains a system of geographical parishes organized into dioceses and archdioceses. The Catholicos-Patriarch is the head of the church. Its synod is composed of bishops who oversee individual dioceses and metropolitans who oversee episcopal dioceses in their territorial jurisdiction.

The Chaldean Syrian Church, which encompasses India and the Persian Gulf, is the largest diocese of the church. Its history goes back to the Church of the East that established a presence in Kerala, but the two communities maintained only a sporadic connection for several centuries, and consistent relations were only established with the arrival of the Portuguese in India around 1500. The church is represented by the Assyrian Church of the East and is in communion with it.

Membership is estimated to 385,000 adherents, although some sources say as high as 500,000. According to scholar James Minahan around 19% of the Assyrian people belong to the Assyrian Church of the East. In its own 2018 Report on Religious Freedom, the United States Department of State put the Assyrian Church of the East adherents at approximately 20% of the Christians in Iraq.

===Hierarchy===

==Ecumenical relations==
On November 11, 1994, a historic meeting between Patriarch Dinkha IV and Pope John Paul II took place in Rome. His Holiness, the Pope, and the patriarch signed a document titled &quot;Common Christological Declaration Between the Catholic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East&quot;. One side effect of this meeting was that the Assyrian Church of the East&#x27;s relationship with the fellow Chaldean Catholic Church began to improve.

Τhe Assyrian Church of the East was never admitted a full member of the Middle East Council of Churches, due to the Coptic Orthodox Church accusing the Assyrian Church of the East to be Nestorian, and thus, heretical.

The lack of a coherent institution narrative in the Anaphora of Addai and Mari, which dates to apostolic times, has caused many Western Christians, and especially Roman Catholics, to doubt the validity of this anaphora, used extensively by the Assyrian Church of the East, as a prayer of consecration of the eucharistic elements. In 2001, after a study of this issue, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI), then Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, promulgated a declaration approved by Pope John Paul II stating that this is a valid anaphora. This declaration opened the door to a joint synodal decree officially implementing the present &quot;Guidelines for Admission to the Eucharist between the Chaldean Church and the Assyrian Church of the East&quot;.

<text>Combat Zones That See, or CTS, is a project of the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) whose goal is to &quot;track everything that moves&quot; in a city by linking up a massive network of surveillance cameras to a centralized computer system. Artificial intelligence software will then identify and track all vehicle movement throughout the city.

CTS is described by DARPA as intended for use in combat zones, to deter enemy attacks on United States troops and to identify and track enemy combatants who launch attacks against U.S. soldiers.

Civil liberties activists and writers of dystopian fiction believe that such programs have great potential for privacy violations, and have openly opposed the project.

<text>Efficiency is the often measurable ability to avoid making mistakes or wasting materials, energy, efforts, money, and time while performing a task. In a more general sense, it is the ability to do things well, successfully, and without waste. 

In more mathematical or scientific terms, it signifies the level of performance that uses the least amount of inputs to achieve the highest amount of output. It often specifically comprises the capability of a specific application of effort to produce a specific outcome with a minimum amount or quantity of waste, expense, or unnecessary effort. Efficiency refers to very different inputs and outputs in different fields and industries. In 2019, the European Commission said: &quot;Resource efficiency means using the Earth&#x27;s limited resources in a sustainable procent manner while minimising impacts on the environment. It allows us to create more with less and to deliver greater value with less input.&quot;

Writer Deborah Stone notes that efficiency is &quot;not a goal in itself. It is not something we want for its own sake, but rather because it helps us attain more of the things we value.&quot;

== Efficiency and effectiveness ==
Efficiency is very often confused with effectiveness. In general, efficiency is a measurable concept, quantitatively determined by the ratio of useful output to total useful input. Effectiveness is the simpler concept of being able to achieve a desired result, which can be expressed quantitatively but does not usually require more complicated mathematics than addition. Efficiency can often be expressed as a percentage of the result that could ideally be expected, for example if no energy were lost due to friction or other causes, in which case 100% of fuel or other input would be used to produce the desired result. In some cases efficiency can be indirectly quantified with a non-percentage value, e.g. specific impulse.

A common but confusing way of distinguishing between efficiency and effectiveness is the saying &quot;Efficiency is doing things right, while effectiveness is doing the right things&quot;. This saying indirectly emphasizes that the selection of objectives of a production process is just as important as the quality of that process. This saying popular in business, however, obscures the more common sense of &quot;effectiveness&quot;, which would/should produce the following mnemonic: &quot;Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is getting things done&quot;. This makes it clear that effectiveness, for example large production numbers, can also be achieved through inefficient processes if, for example, workers are willing or used to working longer hours or with greater physical effort than in other companies or countries or if they can be forced to do so. Similarly, a company can achieve effectiveness, for example large production numbers, through inefficient processes if it can afford to use more energy per product, for example if energy prices or labor costs or both are lower than for its competitors.

==Inefficiency==
Inefficiency is the absence of efficiency. Kinds of inefficiency include:

* Allocative inefficiency refers to a situation in which the distribution of resources between alternatives does not fit with consumer taste (perceptions of costs and benefits). For example, a company may have the lowest costs in &quot;productive&quot; terms, but the result may be inefficient in allocative terms because the &quot;true&quot; or social cost exceeds the price that consumers are willing to pay for an extra unit of the product. This is true, for example, if the firm produces pollution (see also external cost). Consumers would prefer that the firm and its competitors produce less of the product and charge a higher price, to internalize the external cost.
* Distributive inefficiency refers to the inefficient distribution of income and wealth within a society. Decreasing marginal utilities of wealth, in theory, suggests that more egalitarian distributions of wealth are more efficient than inegalitarian distributions. Distributive inefficiency is often associated with economic inequality.
* Economic inefficiency refers to a situation where &quot;we could be doing a better job,&quot; i.e., attaining our goals at lower cost. It is the opposite of economic efficiency. In the latter case, there is no way to do a better job, given the available resources and technology. Sometimes, this type of economic efficiency is referred to as the Koopmans efficiency.
* Keynesian inefficiency might be defined as incomplete use of resources (labor, capital goods, natural resources, etc.) because of inadequate aggregate demand. We are not attaining potential output, while suffering from cyclical unemployment. We could do a better job if we applied deficit spending or expansionary monetary policy.
* Pareto inefficiency is a situation in which one person can not be made better off without making anyone else worse off. In practice, this criterion is difficult to apply in a constantly changing world, so many emphasize Kaldor-Hicks efficiency and inefficiency: a situation is inefficient if someone can be made better off even after compensating those made worse off, regardless of whether the compensation actually occurs.
* Productive inefficiency says that we could produce the given output at a lower cost—or could produce more output for a given cost. For example, a company that is inefficient will have higher operating costs and will be at a competitive disadvantage (or have lower profits than other firms in the market). See Sickles and Zelenyuk (2019, Chapter 3) for more extensive discussions.
* Resource-market inefficiency refers to barriers that prevent full adjustment of resource markets, so that resources are either unused or misused. For example, structural unemployment results from barriers of mobility in labor markets which prevent workers from moving to places and occupations where there are job vacancies. Thus, unemployed workers can co-exist with unfilled job vacancies.
* X-inefficiency refers to inefficiency in the &quot;black box&quot; of production, connecting inputs to outputs. This type of inefficiency says that we could be organizing people or production processes more effectively. Often problems of &quot;morale&quot; or &quot;bureaucratic inertia&quot; cause X-inefficiency.

Productive inefficiency, resource-market inefficiency, and X-inefficiency might be analyzed using data envelopment analysis and similar methods.

== Mathematical expression ==

Efficiency is often measured as the ratio of useful output to total input, which can be expressed with the mathematical formula &quot;r&quot;=&quot;P&quot;/&quot;C&quot;, where &quot;P&quot; is the amount of useful output (&quot;product&quot;) produced per the amount &quot;C&quot; (&quot;cost&quot;) of resources consumed. This may correspond to a percentage if products and consumables are quantified in compatible units, and if consumables are transformed into products via a conservative process. For example, in the analysis of the energy conversion efficiency of heat engines in thermodynamics, the product &quot;P&quot; may be the amount of useful work output, while the consumable &quot;C&quot; is the amount of high-temperature heat input. Due to the conservation of energy, &quot;P&quot; can never be greater than &quot;C&quot;, and so the efficiency &quot;r&quot; is never greater than 100% (and in fact must be even less at finite temperatures).

== In science and technology==

** Allocative efficiency, the optimal distribution of goods
** Efficiency wages, paying workers more than the market rate for increased productivity
* Business efficiency, revenues relative to expenses, etc.
* Efficiency Movement, of the Progressive Era (1890–1932), advocated efficiency in the economy, society and government

=== In other sciences ===
* In computing:
** Algorithmic efficiency, optimizing the speed and memory requirements of a computer program.
** A non-functional requirement (criterion for quality) in systems design and systems architecture which says something about the resource consumption for given load
** Efficiency factor, in data communications
** Storage efficiency, effectiveness of computer data storage
* Efficiency (statistics), a measure of desirability of an estimator

<doc id="268348" wikidata="Q634497" url="?curid=268348" title="Punky Reggae Party">
<text>&quot;Punky Reggae Party&quot; is a song by Bob Marley, recorded and released in 1977. Not appearing on any studio album, it was released in 1977 as a 12-inch single in Jamaica only on the Tuff Gong and Lee Perry&#x27;s Black Art labels, as a B-side to the &quot;Jamming&quot; single on Chris Blackwell&#x27;s Island Records label in some countries and was later released as a live single on &quot;Babylon by Bus&quot;. Subsequently, it appeared on a number of compilations and &quot;Best of&quot; albums as well as the Deluxe Edition of &quot;Exodus&quot; and the 2002 CD reissue of &quot;Legend&quot;. 

The version featured on the 2002 CD reissue of &quot;Legend&quot; is the B-side version from the &quot;Jamming&quot; 12-inch single. There is also a version of the song released as a B-side on the &quot;Jamming&quot; 7-inch single which is much shorter. The two versions of the song on the Jamaican 12-inch single were both featured on disc 2 of the Deluxe Edition of &quot;Exodus&quot;, alongside the versions on the B sides of the &quot;Jamming&quot; 7&quot; and 12&quot; singles.

The song was written by Bob Marley as a positive response to the release of a cover version of Junior Murvin&#x27;s &quot;Police and Thieves&quot; by English punk band the Clash, on their first LP. Referring to the party of the title of the song, the lyrics mention several punk and reggae groups: &quot;The Wailers will be there, the Damned, the Jam, the Clash – Maytals will be there, Dr. Feelgood too&quot;. Marley also often repeated the words &quot;new wave, you brave&quot; during the song. At one time, the list also included the Slits, but mention of them was removed allegedly because they were women.

According to a January 2014 interview with &quot;Midnight Raver&quot;, Sly Dunbar revealed that he played drums on this track. According to Dunbar, the drum track was recorded at Joe Gibbs&#x27;s studio.

However, alternative sources list the personnel as follows:

Bob Marley: Lead vocals, rhythm guitar

Richard Daley: Bass

Angus &quot;Drummie Zeb&quot; Gaye: Drums

Michael &quot;Ibo&quot; Cooper: Keyboards

Stephen &quot;Cat&quot; Coore: Lead guitar

Aura Lewis: Backing vocals

Candy McKenzie: Backing vocals.

The song was referred to in the Sublime song &quot;Garden Grove&quot; and the Robyn Hitchcock song &quot;Antwoman&quot;. Adrian Sherwood of On-U Sound records has used the song title to define a zeitgeist at the end of the 1970s in England, saying of the period, &quot;The Punky Reggae Party was full on. We thought we could change everything&quot;.

==Cover versions==

In 2001, French punk band Burning Heads covered the song. It appeared on &quot;It&#x27;s a Frenchy Ska Reggae Party Vol. 3&quot; compilation.

In 2012, an American reggae band, Island Head, covered the song and named their debut album &quot;Punky Reggae Party&quot;. Island Head musicians include Jamaican guitarist Mikey &quot;Mao&quot; Chung who is known for being part of the Peter Tosh band, and Andy Bassford, known for playing with Dennis Brown and Toots and the Maytals. Island Head&#x27;s bandleader/producer Billy Messinetti played drums and percussion, David Frank of the band the System played all of the keyboards, trumpet player Don Harris is co-producer, Timmy Cappello played saxophone and Neil Jason (Brecker Brothers Band) played bass.

Katchafire&#x27;s cover version appeared on the 2016 compilation, &quot;Stir It Up: Aotearoa&#x27;s Tribute to Bob Marley&quot;.
