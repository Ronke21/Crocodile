<text>Cattle mutilation (also known as bovine excision and unexplained livestock death, or animal mutilation) is the killing and mutilation of cattle under supposedly unusual, usually bloodless circumstances. This phenomenon has been observed among wild animals as well. Worldwide, sheep, horses, goats, pigs, rabbits, cats, dogs, bison, moose, deer and elk have been reported mutilated with similar bloodless excisions; often an ear, eyeball, jaw flesh, tongue, lymph nodes, genitals and rectum are removed.

Since the first reports of animal mutilations, various explanations have been offered, ranging from natural decomposition and normal predation to cults and secretive governmental and military agencies, to a range of speculations, including cryptid predators (such as the &quot;chupacabra&quot;) and extraterrestrials. Mutilations have been the subject of two independent federal investigations in the United States.

==Early history==
The earliest known documented outbreak of unexplained livestock deaths occurred in early 1606 &quot;...about the city of London and some of the shires adjoining. Whole slaughters of sheep have been made, in some places to number 100, in others less, where nothing is taken from the sheep but their tallow and some inward parts, the whole carcasses, and fleece remaining still behind. &quot;Of this sundry conjectures, but most agree that it tendeth towards some fireworks.&quot; The outbreak was noted in the official records of the Court of James I of England. Charles Fort collected many accounts of cattle mutilations that occurred in England in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

===The &quot;Snippy&quot; horse death of 1967===

Unexplained livestock deaths were relatively unknown until 1967, when the &quot;Pueblo Chieftain&quot; published a story about a horse called &quot;Snippy&quot; that was mysteriously killed and mutilated in Alamosa, Colorado.

On September 9, 1967, Agnes King and her son Harry reportedly found the dead body of their three-year-old horse. The horse&#x27;s head and neck had been skinned and defleshed, and the body displayed cuts that, to King, looked very precise. No blood was at the scene, according to Harry, and a strong medicinal odor was in the air.

The story was republished by the wider press and distributed nationwide; this case was the first to feature speculation that extraterrestrial beings and unidentified flying objects were associated with mutilation. A subsequent investigation by Wadsworth Ayer for the Condon Committee concluded that &quot;There was no evidence to support the assertion that the horse&#x27;s death was associated in any way to abnormal causes&quot;.

Alamosa County Sheriff Ben Phillips suggested that the death was probably due to &quot;a lightning strike&quot; and never bothered to visit the site. Early press coverage of the case misnamed Lady as Snippy. Snippy was Lady&#x27;s sire and belonged to Nellie&#x27;s husband, Berle Lewis. Later press coverage mentions that the horse had been shot &quot;in the rump&quot;. However, two students from Alamosa State College confessed to sneaking out into the pasture and shooting the horse several weeks after the case was publicized.

==Cattle mutilations 1973-1980==
Waves of cattle mutilations were reported in Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, and New Mexico. 

In April 1973, sheriffs in Western Iowa reported unidentified helicopters involved in cattle and pig rustling. In August, similar helicopter-based rustling were reported in Missouri and authorities warned farmers not to fire on helicopters.

===1973 Kansas wave===
On June 10, 1973, Cloud County sheriff Fred Modlin warned the public about a series of telephone calls from a caller identifying as a USDA official conducting a survey of herd population and locations. After the USDA denied such a survey, Modlin advised that the calls might be coming from rustlers. 

On June 14, a 700-pound Heifer was found butchered on the Ray Vizner farm near Munden, Kansas. Its right ear had reported been removed and right rear quarter butchered; Republic County sheriff Bob Blecha argue the death was not the work of predators. Two weeks later, on June 18, a second butchered cow was found on the Lowell Darcy farm, twenty miles away from the first butchered cow; Like the first, its right ear was removed. Local press initially speculated about a &#x27;Mad Dog&#x27; or &#x27;phantom&#x27; Butcher. On August 9, a third butchered cow was found, this one in South County. On August 30, a fourth butchered cow was reported, this one on the Larry LeBlanc farm south of St. Joseph in Cloud County; the right ear was again removed.

On October 25, three cows in Harvey County were discovered with their sex organs removed. On November 15, press reported a slain cow on the Don Peter farm near Munden, the seventh animal death attributed to the &quot;butcher&quot;. The November 22 issue of the Belleville Telescope again referenced the &quot;Mad Dog Cattle Butcher&quot;.

On December 4, 1973, law enforcement including Modlin reported a wave of cattle deaths in seven counties across Kansas and Nebraska. Sexual organs were reported having been removed. An upcoming meeting on the mutilations was announced. On December 6, a killing on the Lavern Hiner farm in Cloud County was reported to be the butcher&#x27;s ninth. By December 13, Kansas law enforcement reported having investigated total 40 mutilations, most occurring on land near US Highway 81. On December 20, State Senator Ross Doyen reported a cattle mutilation on his ranch.

On December 22, the Kansas Brand Commissioner&#x27;s office determined that most of the deaths and removal of sex organs were the result of natural causes including predation, &quot;shipping fever&quot; and blackleg. Modlin and others vocally disagreed with these conclusion and denied that local ranchers would mutilate dead animals for insurance money, calling them &quot;honest and respectable&quot;.

===1974 Nebraska wave===
Reports resumed in April 1974, when a Nebraska cow was discovered mutilated and drained of blood. That month, the North American Newspaper Alliance reported on the 1973 mutilations along with sightings of unidentified helicopters. 

In May, two mutilations were reported in Mills County, Iowa; An AP story argued coyotes were responsible. By June 1974, mutilations were reported in Lancaster County, Nebraska. Custer Country reported similar helicopter sightings and armed patrols. On August 14, 1974, the Cascade County, Montana Sheriff&#x27;s Office received its first report of a mutilated cow.

On August 20, press reported a &quot;new twist&quot; in the mutilations: Days prior, near Agnew, Nebraska, an unidentified helicopter had been spotted hovering 400 feet above where a mutilated cow would later be discovered. The helicopter was reported shining a spotlight into the field; FAA and National Guard reported no knowledge of helicopters operating in the area. Knox County Sheriff Herbert Thompson reported that armed civilians had begun patrols in response to repeated helicopter sightings. Cloud County Attorney William Walsh told press of a jailhouse informant who claimed to be a former cult member and opined the mutilations were likely the result of devil-worshiping cultists. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation and the Kansas Brand Inspectors were reported to lean toward predators as the cause. Amid the cattle mutilation jitters and drought, Oakland, Nebraska experienced as spate of &quot;beast&quot; sightings as residents feared an unidentified noisy night-time animal. State Sen. John Decamp called on authorities to coordinate an investigation into the mutilations.
As on August 28, there had been 25 mutilations reported across five Nebraska counties.

On August 28, press reported that a rancher near Hartington had apparently thwarted a mutilation in progress when he found a helicopter above his field was spotted by a neighbor who summoned the sheriff; All three reportedly witnessed the helicopter as well as a car that also seen shining a spotlight into the field. The following morning, a dead cow was found near where the helicopter had been spotted, but the cow had not been mutilated. Authorities cautioned the public not to shoot at aircraft. On September 5, it was reported that authorities had ordered helicopters to fly above 1000 feet after a commercial helicopter took two bullets during a power line inspection.

On September 11, a supposedly-mutilated cow was revealed at autopsy to have died of natural causes, i.e. bacterial infection. It was the third such mutilation disproved by authorities as the University of Nebraska&#x27;s Department of Veterinary Science. On September 17, over 50 law enforcement officials from 24 counties attended a meeting at the Knox County Courthouse in Center, Nebraska to discuss the mutilations. Participants, who dismissed the cult theory, estimated that out of 80 cow deaths under discussion, about 27 were suspected mutilations.

On September 19, press reported three cases of alleged mutilations in South Dakota: Two in Moody County and one in Lake County. On the advice of the Sheriff, patrols were organized and farmers were instructed to check their herds every 12 hours. On September 30, papers reported on an unusual cow death where the animal was shot with a firearm, incised, and set aflame with fuel oil. Unlike other cases, removed body parts were left on site and no parts of the animal were taken. 

In the September 30, 1974 issue of Newsweek, the magazine became the first national outlet to cover the ongoing mutilation story; Its story reported 100 cattle mutilated in Nebraska, Kansas, and Iowa since May.

On October 2, 1974, South Dakota Attorney General Kermit Sande told press that a number of mutilations had been reported in the state. Mutilations had been reported in three counties, and a psychiatrist argued the person responsible might be psychotic. After five mutilations were reported in Day County, a $500 reward was offered.

It was reported that UFO conspiracy theorists considered cattle mutilations might be related to flying saucers; On November 15, UFO expert J. Allen Hynek released a statement denying any link.

On December 2 1974, press reported on the Minnesota mutilations: two in Kandiyohi County, six in Swift County, and one in Meeker County. The Meeker animal was reportedly drained of blood. Between 1970 and 1974, twenty-two mutilated cattle were reported in Minnesota.

===1975 Colorado===

In 1975, the Colorado Associated Press voted the mutilations as the state&#x27;s top story.
Senator Floyd K. Haskell contacted the FBI asking for help in 1975 due to public concern regarding the issue. He claimed there had been 130 mutilations in Colorado alone, and further reports across nine states. A 1979 FBI report indicated that, according to investigations by the New Mexico State Police, there had been an estimated 8,000 mutilations in Colorado, causing approximately $1 million in damages.

In January 1975, the Michigan ATF tasked Donald E. Flickinger with investigating the mutilations; Flickinger investigated possible links to a &quot;Hell-oriented biker gang&quot;. In May 1975, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation under the leadership of Carl Whiteside.

In October 1975, the New York Times published a story examining cattle mutilations across 11 states.

===1976 Dulce, New Mexico===
On June 13, 1976, Dulce rancher Manuel Gomez reported a mutilation to Officer Gabe Valdez of the New Mexico State Patrol.

===1979 Public meeting===

On April 20, 1979, U.S. Attorney R. E. Thompson and US Senator Harrison Schmidt held a public meeting about cattle mutilations. The meeting was attended by about 80 people. One attendee was Paul Bennewitz, who approached Valdez and reported having seen unidentified lights over Kirtland Air Force Base.

On May 2, 1979, Valdez told press that two drugs had been found in the remains of a mutilated bull found in Torrance County on February 15. Valdez reported one drug, Chlorpromazine (&quot;Thorazine&quot;), was used to tranquilize and immobilize the animal, while a second, unnamed drug was used to &quot;clog the blood and remove it through the jugular vein.&quot; Valdez told papers &quot;We know this stuff is made here, and it isn&#x27;t from outer space. Whoever is doing it is highly sophisticated, and they have a lot of resources. They&#x27;re well organized&quot;. Valdez was described as &quot;the state&#x27;s chief information source on mutilations, having worked on 32 cases... in about three years&quot;.

On June 14, 1981, investigators found a mutilated cow at the Gomez ranch with a large amount of radar chaff nearby.

==Later incidents==
Many cases of mutilation have been reported worldwide since the 1967 Snippy incident, chiefly in the Americas and Australia. In South America, an estimated 3,500 incidents have occurred since 2002, when around 400 cases were reported. Mutilation investigators assert that a large number of cases are never reported to authorities, perhaps no more than one in ten.

In 1993, photographic evidence surfaced of a mutilated male human corpse that was found near the Guarapiranga reservoir of São Paulo, Brazil in 1988. The victim&#x27;s identity was kept private. Theories ranged from a mundane criminal act of homicide, to more fantastical speculation alleging alien abduction due to perceived similarities with UFO-related animal mutilations. An autopsy report concluded the wounds occurred while the victim was still alive, and the associated pain resulted in cardiac arrest. However, another independent investigation later concluded that he died from natural causes.

==Characteristics==
Cattle death due to natural causes are extremely common; In Minnesota, where mutilations first began, nearly 2 million head of cattle were lost during 1973. That year, ranchers began reporting dozens of unusual cattle deaths characterized by absence of sex organs, udders, tongues, anus, rectum, and sometimes ears or eyes.

Cuts were described as &quot;clean&quot; and &quot;surgical&quot;. Some animals were reported to have been drained of blood but with no sign of blood in the immediate area or even around their wounds.

According to Howard Burgess, nearly 90 percent of mutilated cattle are between four and five years old.

In some cases, strange marks or imprints near the site have been found. In the famous &quot;Snippy&quot; case, there was an absolute absence of tracks in a radius of the carcass (even the horse&#x27;s own tracks disappeared within of the body.) But within this radius, several small holes were found seemingly &quot;punched&quot; in the ground and two bushes were absolutely flattened. In Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, June 1976, a &quot;trail of suction cup-like impressions&quot; was found leading from a mutilated three-year-old cow. The indentations were in a tripod form, in diameter, apart, and disappeared from the dead cow. Similar incidents were reported in the area in 1978.

===Laboratory reports===
Laboratory reports carried out on some mutilated animals have shown unusually high or low levels of vitamins or minerals in tissue samples, and the presence of chemicals not normally found in animals. However, not all mutilated animals display these anomalies, and those that do have slightly different anomalies from one another. On account of the time between death and necropsy, and a lack of background information on specific cattle, investigators have often found it impossible to determine if these variations are connected to the animals&#x27; deaths or not.

In one case documented by New Mexico police and the FBI, an 11-month-old cross Hereford-Charolais bull, belonging to a Mr. Manuel Gomez of Dulce, New Mexico, was found mutilated on March 24, 1978. It displayed &quot;classic&quot; mutilation signs, including the removal of the rectum and sex organs with what appeared to be &quot;a sharp and precise instrument&quot; and its internal organs were found to be inconsistent with a normal case of death followed by predation.

The animal&#x27;s heart as well as bone and muscle samples were sent to the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory for microscopic and bacteriological studies, while samples from the animal&#x27;s liver were sent to two separate private laboratories.

Los Alamos detected the presence of naturally occurring &quot;Clostridium&quot; bacteria in the heart, but was unable to reach any conclusions because of the possibility that the bacteria represented postmortem contamination. No microscopic changes of pathological significance were found in the heart tissue.

Samples from the animal&#x27;s liver were found to be completely devoid of copper and to contain 4 times the normal level of zinc, potassium and phosphorus. The scientists performing the analysis were unable to explain these anomalies.

Blood samples taken at the scene were reported to be &quot;light pink in color&quot; and &quot;Did not clot after several days&quot; while the animal&#x27;s hide was found to be unusually brittle for a fresh death (the animal was estimated to have been dead for 5 hours) and the flesh underneath was found to be discolored.

None of the laboratories were able to report any firm conclusions on the cause of the blood or tissue damage. At the time, it was suggested that a burst of radiation may have been used to kill the animal, blowing apart its red blood cells in the process. This hypothesis was later discarded as subsequent reports from the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory later confirmed the presence of anti-coagulants in samples taken from other cows mutilated in the region.

===Helicopter sightings===
On July 15, 1974, two unregistered helicopters, a white helicopter and a black twin-engine aircraft were reported to have opened fire on Robert Smith Jr. while he was driving his tractor on his farm in Honey Creek, Iowa. This attack followed a rash of alleged mutilations in the area and across the nearby border in Nebraska. In August 1974, state leaders called for an investigation.

On August 20, 1974, the &quot;Lincoln Journal Star&quot; reported that residents had seen unidentified helicopters shining spotlights into fields where mutilated cows were later found. Know County Sheriff Herbert Thompson claimed helicopter sightings had become a nightly occurrence, with both the FAA and the National Guard reportedly being unaware of any helicopter activity. However, both Thompson and the Nebraska State Patrol found no definite connection between the cattle deaths and the helicopter sightings.

By 1975, the problem was so prevalent, that some ranchers formed armed vigilante groups to patrol their fields at night. Authorities ran ads in Colorado urging ranchers to not shoot at their survey helicopters. The National Guard warned its helicopter pilots to fly at higher than normal altitude to avoid fire from &quot;jittery farmers&quot;.

In 1976, two Cache County, Utah, police officers reportedly confronted several men in an unmarked U.S. Army helicopter at a small community airport in Cache County. The witnesses asserted that after this heated encounter, cattle mutilations in the region ceased for about five years. The story was first published in a 2002 report.

On April 8, 1979, three police officers in Dulce, New Mexico, reported a mysterious aircraft which resembled a U.S. military helicopter hovering around a site following a wave of alleged mutilation which claimed 16 cows. The reports of &quot;helicopter&quot; involvement have been used to explain why some cattle appear to have been &quot;dropped&quot; from considerable heights.

==Official investigations==
The New Mexico Livestock Board sought assistance from the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. Colorado Bureau of Investigation agents went undercover to investigate. Oklahoma convened a task force.

After coming under increasing public pressure, Federal authorities launched a comprehensive investigation of the mutilation phenomenon.
===Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms===
In January 1975, the Minnesota field office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) launched their own investigation into the phenomenon, headed by Agent Donald Flickinger. Flickinger was tasked with investigating the possible connections between cults and the mutilation of cattle.

Flickinger recorded a number of &quot;unusual&quot; incidents and circumstantial evidence, but was unable to find sufficient evidence of cult involvement for the ATF to take further action. Media reports of the time reported his investigation was dropped when it was determined cattle deaths were not a prelude to a coordinated campaign against elected officials by cult members. During the investigation, Flickinger arranged for two prison informants to be transferred to less-secure facilities; both ultimately escaped, on separate occasions. Flickinger closed his investigation by Spring 1975.

===Colorado Bureau of Investigation===
In May 1975, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation under the leadership of Carl Whiteside. 19 animals underwent necropsies at Colorado State University but no conclusive results emerged. A $40,000 reward was offered. The US Bureau of Land Management was forced to ground all helicopters in Eastern Colorado. By December, the CBI had investigated 203 reports of cattle mutilations. The CBI investigation was closed after Colorado mutiliation reports dwindled in Summer 1976.

===New Mexico State Police===
On June 13, 1976, the New Mexico State Police began an investigation, headed by Officer Gabe Valdez with the assistance of Cattle Inspector Jim Dyad and Officer Howard Johnston of the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish.

Valdez began investigating and solicited the assistance of retired Sandia National Laboratories scientist Howard Burgess. On the night of July 5, suspecting that cattle might be &quot;marked&quot; in a way detectable from the air at night, Burgess and Valdez screened the Gomez herd; five animals were found to have been marked with a chemical that fluoresced under ultraviolet light. 

On June 14, 1981, intact radar chaff was found near a mutilated cow on the Gomez ranch.

This investigation reported finding evidence that some mutilated animals had been tranquilized and treated with an anti-coagulant prior to their mutilation. It also contended that alleged surgical techniques performed during mutilations had become &quot;more professional&quot; over time. However, officers in charge were unable to determine responsibility or motive.

===Rommel investigation===
Despite repeated requests from US Senator Haskell, the FBI declined to investigate, arguing there was no evidence of crossing state lines and thus no federal jurisdiction. In lieu of a federal investigation, a federally funded investigation was conducted under the direction of the New Mexico District Attorney&#x27;s office.

Beginning in May 1979, an investigation was funded by a $44,170 grant () from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, and was headed by recently-retired FBI agent Kenneth Rommel. It had five key objectives:
# To determine the reliability of the information on which the grant was based, which entailed gathering as much information as possible about the cases reported in New Mexico prior to May 1979
# To determine the cause of as many mutilations as possible, especially those reported in New Mexico
# To determine if livestock mutilations as described constitute a major law enforcement problem
# If these mutilations do constitute a major law enforcement problem, to determine the scope of the problem and to offer recommendations on how to deal with it
# If it is shown that the mutilation phenomenon is not a law enforcement problem, to recommend that no further law enforcement investigations be funded.

Rommel&#x27;s final report, released in June 1980, was 297 pages long; in the report&#x27;s introduction, Rommel stated: &quot;According to some estimates, by 1979 10,000 head of cattle have been mysteriously mutilated&quot;. However, the report concluded that the mutilations were predominantly the result of natural predation, but that some cases contained anomalies that could not be accounted for by conventional wisdom. The FBI was unable to identify any individuals responsible for the mutilations. Details of the investigation are now available under the Freedom of Information Act. The released material includes correspondence from Rommel where he states that &quot;most credible sources have attributed this damage to normal predator and scavenger activity&quot;.

New Mexico State patrolman Gabe Valdez, who by the time of the Rommel report had investigated dozens of mutilation cases, told investigator Christopher O&#x27;Brien that &quot;during the six to eight months when Rommel was actively investigating the mutilations in New Mexico, the state (especially the northern tier) became suddenly quiet with very few (if any) true mutilations being reported to officials&quot;. Valdez was convinced that Rommel never was able to investigate a single genuine mutilation because the mutilators moved their operations to other parts of the west. Rommel (a former FBI bank robbery expert) was disgusted by dead necrotic cows and chose to let others do the actual investigations while he waited upwind in the car.

Western Canada, during this period, was especially hard hit. During the six to eight months of Rommel&#x27;s investigation, RCMP investigator Corporal Lyn Lauber of the Calgary detachment (who was in charge of the Canadian mutilation probe) investigated numerous mutilation cases. When Rommel&#x27;s final report was released to the public, Lauber answered an inquiry by investigator Tommy Bland: &quot;I find it difficult to understand how Rommel could make a statement such as this, without ever having personally witnessed a [real] mutilation firsthand&quot;. He also stated that &quot;I would like to see Rommel write off our confirmed cases as due to predators&quot;.

==Conventional explanations==
As with most disputed phenomena, there are a number of potential explanations for the causes of cattle mutilations, ranging from death by natural causes to purposeful acts by unknown individuals.

On April 20, 1979, C Hibbs of the New Mexico State Veterinary diagnostics Laboratory spoke before a hearing chaired by Senator Harrison Schmitt. Hibbs testified that mutilation fell into three categories: Natural causes such as predators, deaths caused by pranksters or deviants, and animals mutilated with &quot;sharp instruments&quot;.

===Natural causes===

While many unconventional explanations have been put forward to explain cattle mutilations, a variety of scientists, veterinary workers, and knowledgeable observers (including farmers and other agricultural workers) have suggested more conventional ideas, most of which revolve around the hypothesis that &quot;mutilated&quot; animals died of natural causes and were subjected to known terrestrial phenomena – including the action of predators, parasites, and scavengers.

Missing or mutilated mouth, lips, anus, and genitalia are explained as:
* Contraction of missing/damaged areas due to dehydration.
* The actions of small scavengers and burrowing parasites seeking to enter or consume the body in areas where skin is at its thinnest.

Missing/mutilated eyes and soft internal organs are explained as:
* The action of carrion feeding insects such as blowflies, and opportunistic or carrion birds such as vultures, which are known to direct themselves toward an animal&#x27;s eyes, and to enter the body through the openings of the mouth and anus in order to feed on soft internal organs.

Absence of blood is explained as:
* Blood pooling in the lowest points in the body where it will break down into its basic organic components.
* Blood that is external to the body, or in the area of a wound being consumed by insects or reduced by solar desiccation.

Surgical incisions in the skin are explained as:
* Tears in the skin created when it is stretched by postmortem bloat and/or as dehydration causes the animal&#x27;s hide to shrink and split, often in linear cuts.
* Incisions caused by scavengers or predators, possibly exacerbated by the above.

The hypothesis that natural phenomena account for most mutilation characteristics has been validated by a number of experiments, including one cited by long-time scientific skeptic Robert T. Carroll, conducted by Washington County (Arkansas) Sheriff&#x27;s Office. In the experiment, the body of a recently deceased cow was left in a field and observed for 48 hours. During the 48 hours, postmortem bloating was reported to have caused incision-like tears in the cow&#x27;s skin that matched the &quot;surgical&quot; cuts reported on mutilated cows, while the action of blowflies and maggots reportedly matched the soft tissue damage observed on mutilated cows.

Experiments have also been conducted to compare the different reactions of surgically cut hide/flesh and predated hide/flesh to natural exposure. They demonstrated pronounced differences between surgical cuts and non surgical cuts over time.

Some ranchers have disputed the scientific &quot;natural causes hypothesis&quot; on the grounds that the mutilated animals often fall outside of the normal categories of natural deaths by predation or disease. One reason cited is that the animals were healthy and showed no sign of disease prior to death, and were large and strong enough not to be a likely target for a predator. In some cases, ranchers have reported that the mutilated cattle were among the healthiest and strongest animals in their herd.

===Animal cruelty, pranks, and hoaxes===

It is alternatively hypothesised that cattle mutilations are the result of two unrelated deviant phenomena. The bulk of mutilations are the result of predation and other natural processes, and those with anomalies that cannot be explained in this way are the work of humans who derive pleasure or sexual stimulation from mutilating animals. Lone individuals have attacked larger animals, including sheep, cows, and horses. Humans, particularly those with sociopathic disorders, have been found to have mutilated animals in elaborate ways using knives or surgical instruments.

===Covert monitoring of threats to public health===
In 1997, cattle mutilation researcher Charles T. Oliphant speculated the killings might be the result of covert research into emerging cattle diseases, and the possibility they could be transmitted to humans.

Biochemist Colm Kelleher, who has investigated several purported mutilations first-hand, argues that the mutilations are most likely a clandestine U.S. government effort to track the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (&quot;mad cow disease&quot;) and related diseases, such as scrapie. Kelleher argues there was an &quot;uncanny resemblance between the pattern of organ removals that were taking place in cattle mutilations and standard wildlife sampling techniques for monitoring the spread of infectious agents in the wild.&quot; Kelleher furthered noted that infectious disease experts had a history of using helicopters to conduct surveys, euthanizing animals with sedatives before removing organs, and applying formaldehyde to the carcasses of animals to prevent consumption by scavengers; mutilated cattle were found to have traces of sedatives and formaldehyde, and their carcasses were avoided by scavengers.

In 2014, Gabe&#x27;s son Greg Valdez authored &quot;Dulce Base: The Truth and Evidence from the Case Files of Gabe Valdez&quot; based on his father&#x27;s files. Greg Valdez reports his father never believed aliens were involved: &quot;People want to come and find aliens, but there is no proof of aliens and my father never believed there was alien activity. He pointed toward the government.&quot; Greg Valdez concludes that mutilations were a government testing program looking at the after-effects of radiation from 1967&#x27;s Project Gasbuggy, in which an underground atomic device was detonated just southwest of Dulce: &quot;They were testing the cattle to avoid panicking the public&quot;.

===Secret weapons testing===
Edwards reported his theory that the government was testing cattle parts to develop biological weapons to use in Vietnam, going so far as to write to Colorado Senator Floyd K. Haskell during Haskell&#x27;s investigation to accuse agents of threatening him into silence.

In October, Edwards gave an interview to the &quot;Gazette&quot; (&quot;Colorado Springs Gazette Telegraph&quot;), announcing a theory that a government project was behind the mutilations. He expressed frustration that the FBI would not get involved and said he would be writing a book explaining &quot;how the project was conceived&quot;. Shortly after, he was fired by the &quot;Gazette&quot; and then disappeared. On December 5, 1975, Edwards&#x27; wife reported him as a missing person. Edwards reemerged in the 1990s. He had adopted a new name, Dr. David Ellsworth, and founded an English-language instruction program that was adopted by many federal universities in Mexico.

Proponents of the weapons test hypothesis point to the fact that in March 1968, 6,000 sheep were killed as part of chemical weapons testing; the Army denied responsibility until 1998.

==Other explanations==
Fringe explanations for the mutiliation have blamed satanic cults, aliens, or even mythical monsters. Historian Michael J. Goleman has argued that ranchers&#x27; conflicts with the federal government fueled nefarious explanations.

=== Satanic cults ===

Closely related to the deviant hypothesis is the hypothesis that cattle mutilations are the result of cult activity. However, contrary to the deviancy hypothesis, which holds that cattle are mutilated at random by individual deviants, the cult hypothesis holds that cattle mutilations are coordinated acts of ritual sacrifice carried out by organized groups.

In July 1975, reporter Dane Edwards of the &quot;Brush Banner&quot; published a cattle mutilation story and began investigating a theory that a cult was responsible. When the origin of the cult theory was traced to a federal inmate and no cult members were ever identified, ranchers and law enforcement started looking for other explanations.

Beliefs held by proponents of the cult hypothesis vary, but may include:
* That the apparent absence of blood at mutilation sites may indicate cult members would harvest it
* That organs have been removed from cattle for use in rituals
* That unborn calves have been harvested from mutilated cattle.

The hypothesis that cults were responsible for cattle mutilation was developed in the U.S. during the 1970s and 1980s, a time of growing national concern over cults (such as the Peoples Temple and Jonestown) and ritual satanic abuse (&quot;Satanic panic&quot;).

However, there were various reports during the time of menacing groups prowling around mutilation sites. In September 1975, a forestry service employee in Blaine County, Idaho, reported seeing a group of people in black hooded robes. Several cattle were found mutilated in the area the following day. On October 9, 1975, a motorist on U.S. Highway 95 in northern Idaho, in an area of frequent cattle mutilation, reported to police that some 15 masked individuals formed a roadblock with linked arms, forcing him to turn around.

Since the beginning of the cult hypothesis, law enforcement agents in several states and provinces, including Alberta, Idaho, Montana, and Iowa have reported evidence implicating cults in several instances of cattle mutilations.

During their investigations, the FBI and the ATF were unable to find appropriate evidence, including signs of consistency between mutilations, to substantiate that the animals had been the victims of any form of ritual sacrifice or organized mutilation effort. They were also unable to determine how or why a cult would perform procedures that would result in the anomalies reported in some necropsies, or to verify that the anomalies were 1) connected to the mutilations themselves 2) the result of human intervention.

In most cases, mutilations were either ruled due to natural causes, or the cattle were too far decayed for any useful conclusions to be drawn. Some cases of cult hysteria were traced back to fabrication by individuals unrelated to the incident. In one case it was concluded that claims had been falsified by a convict seeking favorable terms on his sentence in exchange for information. In another case, claims were traced back to local high school students who had circulated rumors as a joke.

===Aliens===

Since the Snippy case in 1967, press had linked reports of unidentified aircraft to UFOs and flying saucers. 
In 1974, a few months after the first spate of alleged mutilations in the US, multiple farmers in Nebraska claimed to witness UFOs on the nights their cattle were harmed. The sightings were hailed by UFO researchers as the first physical evidence of extraterrestrial life. In 1980, journalist Linda Moulton Howe produced &quot;A Strange Harvest&quot;, a documentary on cattle mutilations. Based on information provided by a supposed-insider source called &quot;Rick Doty&quot;, Howe used the film to claim the mutilations were linked to UFOs and aliens.

The 2013 documentary &quot;Mirage Men&quot; suggests there was conspiracy by the U.S. military to fabricate UFO folklore in order to deflect attention from classified military projects. The book it is based on, also called &quot;Mirage Men&quot;, was published in 2010 by Constable &amp; Robinson. &quot;Mirage Men&quot; discusess how, on April 20, 1979, U.S. Attorney R. E. Thompson and US Senator Harrison Schmidt held a public meeting about the ongoing cattle mutilations. The meeting was attended by about 80, including UFO researcher Paul Bennewitz. At the meeting, Bennewitz was introduced to highway patrol officer Gabe Valdez who was leading the state investigation into the incidents. &quot;Mirage Men&quot; suggests government agents likely &quot;first identified&quot; Bennewitz at this meeting and perhaps outright targeted him for his participation.

By August 1988, Bennewitz was accusing his wife of being in control of the extraterrestrials. After attempting to barricade himself in his home using sandbags, his family admitted him to the mental health unit of Presbyterian Anna Kaseman Hospital; He remained under observation there for one month.

On July 1, 1989, UFO author William Moore claimed that he tried to push Bennewitz into a mental breakdown by feeding him false information about aliens. This was corroborated by a declassified CIA document that claims Moore and another officer of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Richard Doty, are responsible for a disinformation campaign against Bennewitz.

In 1990, the Bennewitz story was featured in Howard Blum&#x27;s book &quot;Out There: The Government&#x27;s Secret Quest for Extraterrestrials&quot;. Blum publicized that the government had sent undercover agents to befriend and mislead Bennewitz using counterfeit documents.

===Mythic monsters===

Folklore has attributed the mutilations to &quot;chupacabras&quot; and similar creatures. &quot;Mothman&quot; author John Keel mentioned investigating animal mutilation cases in 1966 (while with Ivan T. Sanderson) that were being reported in the Upper Ohio River Valley, around Gallipolis, Ohio.

==In popular culture==
In 1982, researcher David Perkins authored &quot;Altered Steaks&quot; on the topic. In 1984, Bantam Books published &quot;Mute Evidence&quot; by journalists Daniel Kagan and Ian Summers. In 2014, Christopher O&#x27;Brian authored &quot;Stalking the Herd&quot;. 

The 1977 British television mockumentary Alternative 3 linked mutilations to a fictional plan to transport livestock to secret military bases on the Moon and Mars.

The 1992 film &quot;Sneakers&quot; featured Dan Aykroyd as a conspiracy theorist who links aliens to cattle mutilations. &quot;The X-Files&quot; episodes &quot;Eve&quot; and &quot;Irresistible&quot; included mention of cattle mutilations. In Dulce, New Mexico and elsewhere, pranksters have added UFO images to roadside signs warning of cattle crossing. The 1997 pilot episode of South Park titled Cartman Gets an Anal Probe references UFO and aliens as being linked to cattle mutilation. The 2022 film &quot;Nope&quot; features a biological flying saucer that feeds on livestock.

<doc id="263492" wikidata="Q3381375" url="?curid=263492" title="Phoenix Command">
<text>Phoenix Command is a combat-oriented role-playing game system published by Leading Edge Games in 1986. Variations of its rules system have also been used in other military games such as &quot;Morning Star Missions&quot;, &quot;Living Steel&quot;, and &quot;Aliens Adventure Game&quot;.

==Description==
Although &quot;Phoenix Command&quot; is ostensibly a role-playing game, and does have character generation and skills resolution systems, the extremely detailed rules for small arms combat are the central focus of the game. The game utilizes lookup tables which resolve injuries to specific digits, organs, and bones, and simulates the physics of different attacks, such as bullets with different velocities.

==Publication history==
&quot;Phoenix Command&quot; was designed by Barry Nakazono and David McKenzie, and was published by Leading Edge Games in 1986 as a boxed set containing a 56-page spiral bound rule book, 32 page modern military weapon data supplement, reference tables, blank character sheets and one ten-sided die.

Additional supplements were subsequently published, including &quot;Hand to Hand Combat System&quot; (1988), &quot;World War 2 Weapon Data Supplement&quot; (1988), &quot;Wild West Weapon Data Supplement&quot; (1989), &quot;Civilian Weapon Data Supplement&quot; (1987), &quot;Living Steel Power Armour Sourcebook&quot; (1991), &quot;Advanced Damage Tables&quot; (1987), &quot;High Tech Weapon Data Supplement&quot; (1987), &quot;Phoenix Command Advanced Rules for Small Arms Combat&quot; (1986), &quot;Phoenix Command Damage Tables: Small Arms&quot; (1986), and &quot;Phoenix Command Small Arms Combat System&quot; (1989).

==Reception==
In Issue 47 of &quot;Different Worlds&quot;, Roman Andron was impressed, saying, &quot;Never before have such high degrees of realism and playability been achieved simultaneously in the gaming world. Compared to this, all other combat systems are nothing.&quot; Despite the complexity of the combat system, Andron insisted, &quot;The combat system is easy to use.&quot; Andron also liked the deadliness of the combat system since &quot;combatants are incapacitated or killed quickly once hit, and do not clutter up play.&quot; Andron did think that the game should have used the metric system, and also found the use of too many acronyms slowed down the learning process. Despite this, Andron gave a positive recommendation, saying, &quot;| heartily recommend this system to weapons buffs or anyone wanting to put realism into their role-playing or wargaming. &quot;Phoenix Command&quot; provides for a simple yet highly-realistic simulation of modern firearms combat. However, my recommendations cannot do justice to the system. It has to be used to be fully appreciated.&quot;

Writing for &quot;Gizmodo&quot;, Ed Grabianowski found the complexity took away from the enjoyment of the game, saying, &quot;This game of modern combat closely resembles what &quot;Actuary: The RPG&quot; would look like. Its goal is insanely detailed accuracy, with table after table describing the statistical values of weapons and ammunition and what happens when said ammunition hits a human body.&quot;

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, game critic Rick Swan called this &quot;Less of an RPG than a meticulous combat system&quot; and noted that it was made for &quot;role-players who relish every smack and slash of a combat encounter.&quot; Although Swan found the combat system quite complex, he noted that it &quot;plays quite well and produces astonishingly realistic results.&quot; Swan found the role-playing rules &quot;merely adequate&quot; and the scenarios &quot;fairly routine&quot;, and suggested the game would be more useful as a supplement and reference to other military role-playing games such as &quot;Top Secret/S.I.&quot; or &quot;Twilight 2000&quot;. He concluded by giving the game a solid rating of 3 out of 4, saying, &quot;as a combat system, &quot;Phoenix Command&quot; is top of the line, rivaling the best tactical wargames in detail and sophistication.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, writer Stu Horvath found the combat system very complex, noting, &quot;It is dismaying in its detail, chronicling the many possible ways to shoot guns (and be shot by them) with excruciating precision... While the proliferation of military RPGs in the &#x27;80s is evidence that there are players who find this sort of chart consultation exhilarating, it beggars belief that these sorts of systems saw regular play without significant simplification through house rules.&quot;&quot;

<text>Road Show (previously titled Bounce, Wise Guys, and Gold!) is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book by John Weidman. It tells the story of Addison Mizner and his brother Wilson Mizner&#x27;s adventures across America from the beginning of the twentieth century during the Klondike gold rush to the Florida real estate boom of the 1920s. The musical takes considerable liberties with the facts of the brothers&#x27; lives. 

The history and evolution of the show are extraordinarily complex, with numerous different versions and recordings. After a 1999 workshop in New York City, the musical was produced in Chicago and Washington, D.C. in 2003 under the title Bounce. Although it did not achieve much success it is notable due to the fact it is the last collaboration between writer-director duo Stephen Sondheim and Harold Prince. A revised version of the musical premiered Off-Broadway in New York in October 2008 where the show was redubbed &quot;Road Show&quot;.

==Background==
Addison and Wilson Mizner both died in 1933. Interest in their colorful lives as dramatic/musical subjects began with the 1952 publication of &quot;The Last Resorts&quot;, by Cleveland Amory. Irving Berlin was a friend of Addison, and referred to Wilson as &quot;my pal.&quot; He began work on a musical called &quot;The Mizner Story&quot;. It was not completed; a partial manuscript is in the Library of Congress. After the 1953 publication of Alva Johnston&#x27;s &quot;The Legendary Mizners&quot; he returned to the project and completed &quot;Wise Guy&quot;. It was never produced, though songs from it have been published and recorded.

At about the same time, Sondheim began work on a musical based on &quot;The Last Resorts&quot;, which he discussed with Oscar Hammerstein. In 1956 David Merrick, &quot;for purposes of comparison, sent Sondheim a script by Sam Behrman of Irving Berlin&#x27;s unproduced musical.&quot; Sondheim set his idea aside. Three songs from it (&quot;Pour le Sport&quot;, &quot;High Life&quot;, and &quot;I Wouldn&#x27;t Change a Thing&quot;) have been published in &quot;The almost unknown Stephen Sondheim&quot;.

==Production history==
The musical premiered at the New York Theatre Workshop from October through November 1999 under the title, &quot;Wise Guys&quot;. It was directed by Sam Mendes and starred Nathan Lane and Victor Garber as brothers Addison Mizner and Wilson Mizner. A legal case involving Scott Rudin and Weidman and Sondheim held up further production.

Rewritten and given the new title &quot;Bounce&quot;, the show opened on June 20, 2003 at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. The production was directed by Harold Prince, with choreography by Michael Arnold, set design by Eugene Lee, costume design by Miguel Angel Huidor, lighting design by Howell Binkley, and hair design by David H. Lawrence. The cast starred Richard Kind (Addison Mizner), Howard McGillin (Wilson Mizner), Jane Powell (Mama Mizner), Herndon Lackey (Papa Mizner/Businessman/Englishman/Plantation Owner/Armstrong/Real Estate Owner), Gavin Creel (Hollis Bessemer), and Michele Pawk (Nellie). This production reunited Sondheim with longtime collaborator Prince for the first time since the disastrous original Broadway production of &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot; in 1981.

The musical then ran at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. in October and November 2003 with the Chicago cast. It received mixed–to–negative reviews and was not produced in New York. A private reading of &quot;Bounce&quot; was held at the Public Theater on February 6, 2006. &quot;Playbill&quot; reported that Eric Schaeffer directed, with Richard Kind and Bernadette Peters among the cast.

A new production of the musical, now titled &quot;Road Show&quot;, rewritten without an intermission and without the leading female character of Nellie (who had been added for 2003 production), opened Off-Broadway at The Public Theater&#x27;s Newman Theater in previews on October 28, 2008, officially opening on November 18, and closing December 28, 2008. The director/designer was John Doyle, who had become known for critically-acclaimed Broadway revivals of &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; (in 2005) and &quot;Company&quot; (2006); it starred Michael Cerveris and Alexander Gemignani playing brothers Wilson and Addison Mizner respectively, Alma Cuervo as Mama, Claybourne Elder as Hollis, and William Parry as Papa. This production won the 2009 Obie Award for Music and Lyrics. and the Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Lyrics (Sondheim).

The title changes reflect attempts by the creators to hone the show&#x27;s story and themes. &quot;Ideally the title is connected to what we hope the show is about,&quot; Weidman said.

The musical opened at the Menier Chocolate Factory, London in previews on June 24, 2011, officially on July 6 and closed on September 18. John Doyle was the director and designer, with a cast featuring Michael Jibson, David Bedella, and Jon Robyns.

The U.S. regional premiere opened at Stages Repertory Theatre in Houston, Texas on May 22, 2013, directed by Kenn McLaughlin. The cast featured Tom Frey and L. Jay Meyer, playing Wilson and Addison Mizner, respectively, along with Susan Shofner as Mama, Jimmy Phillips as Papa, and Michael McClure as Hollis. Rounding out the cast were Cameron Bautsch, Bridget Bierne, Hunter Frederick, Sarah Myers, Amanda Parker, Amanda Passanante, Tom Prior, and Brandon Whitley.

A production opened at the Chicago Shakespeare Theatre on March 13, 2014, starring Andrew Rothenberg as Wilson and Michael Aaron Lindner as Addison.

The New England premiere of &quot;Road Show&quot; ran from January 12 to February 11, 2018 at The Lyric Stage Company of Boston in Boston, Massachusetts.

In 2019, &quot;Road Show&quot; was presented as part of the Encores! Off-Center season at New York City Center from July 24–27. This production starred Brandon Uranowitz as Addison, Raúl Esparza as Wilson, Chuck Cooper as Papa Mizner, Mary Beth Peil as Mama Mizner, and Jin Ha as Hollis Bessemer and was directed and choreographed by Will Davis.

==Early versions==
In the workshop, then titled &quot;Wise Guys,&quot; the show was framed as a vaudeville act, with Wilson and Addison opening the show with the title song, in the style of vaudeville comics, a theme that recurred over the show. The tone was meant to be similar to the Road to ... films starring Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. There was an additional song for Mama Mizner called &quot;Brothers&quot;, and a song for Wilson called &quot;Stay Right Where You Are&quot;, in which he seduces his future wife. Addison had a song in Act II sung to a sick Wilson called, &quot;Make it Through the Night.&quot; This version dealt with Addison&#x27;s real-life business partner Paris Singer; however, the writers soon decided to deal more openly with Addison&#x27;s sexuality, and the character of Hollis Bessemer was created. Eventually, the vaudeville concept was dropped, and the overall tone of the show became less comic.

In the later stage version, then titled &quot;Bounce,&quot; the character of Wilson&#x27;s wife was developed into a secondary lead called Nellie. Wilson first meets her in a saloon in Alaska, where she seduces him with the song &quot;What&#x27;s Your Rush?&quot;. They re-encounter each other in New York, Nellie having become rich on the brothers&#x27; gold claim, and they marry after the song &quot;The Best Thing That Ever Has Happened&quot;. She divorces him when his enterprises interfere with their love life. The brothers meet her again in Florida, where she joins in the Boca Raton scheme. After this fails, she leaves with Hollis to find her next opportunity. In &quot;Road Show&quot;, her character was again reduced to Wilson&#x27;s marriage to her in Act I.

For &quot;Road Show&quot;, Sondheim rewrote the opening number &quot;Bounce&quot; as &quot;Waste,&quot; to reflect a darker tone. He added an additional song, &quot;Brotherly Love,&quot; for the Mizners, and rewrote &quot;The Best Thing That Ever Has Happened&quot; as a duet for Addison and Hollis.

==Plot of &quot;Road Show&quot;==
After the 1933 death of Addison Mizner, people who knew him, including his estranged lover Hollis Bessemer, comment on his life and the way he squandered his talents (&quot;Waste&quot;). Addison&#x27;s younger brother Wilson appears and speaks to Addison, who angrily claims that Wilson was the cause of all his failures. The time shifts to Papa Mizner&#x27;s death in California at the beginning of the twentieth century. On his deathbed, Papa charges his sons with the task of using their gifts to shape America (&quot;It&#x27;s In Your Hands Now&quot;), telling them that there&#x27;s a &quot;road&quot; to follow. Mama Mizner reveals the family&#x27;s wealth has been eaten away by Papa&#x27;s long illness and advises the boys to seek gold in Alaska; Addison is reluctant, but goes along with Wilson anyway (&quot;Gold!&quot;).

In the Klondike, the brothers share a sleeping bag and reminisce about their childhood (&quot;Brotherly Love&quot;). Wilson leaves to get supplies while Addison works the claim. Wilson is lured into a game of poker. Addison is shocked to discover his brother gambling. Wilson explains his newfound love of taking risks regardless of what&#x27;s at stake (&quot;The Game&quot;). Wilson stakes their gold claim in a poker game and wins the saloon in which the game is taking place. (This episode is fictitious.) A shade of Papa Mizner appears and tells Addison that this was not what he had in mind for his sons.

Addison leaves in disgust with his share of Wilson&#x27;s winnings and travels around the world searching for business opportunities and a sense of purpose (&quot;Addison&#x27;s Trip&quot;). All of his ventures fail due to bad luck. He is left with nothing but souvenirs that inspire him to take up architecture (so he can design a house in which to show them off). Wilson&#x27;s businesses in Alaska also have failed, so he comes south to seek his brother&#x27;s help. Wilson seduces and marries Addison&#x27;s first client, a rich widow, and fritters away her money on various flashy endeavours, including fixed boxing matches and horse races (&quot;That Was A Year&quot;).

Although Wilson&#x27;s various partners lose money, they remain fond of him because of the verve and energy with which he lives. Even Mama Mizner, who is being looked after by Addison and never receives any visits from Wilson, enjoys reading about Wilson&#x27;s exploits, saying that she can live through him (&quot;Isn&#x27;t He Something!&quot;). Only Addison remains uncharmed by Wilson, and when Wilson finally comes back, his resources exhausted, he finds that Mama has died in his absence. Addison angrily throws Wilson out of the house.

Learning of rising property interests in Florida (&quot;Land Boom!&quot;), Addison decides to travel to Palm Beach to take advantage of the many rich people settling there who need houses built. (In reality, Mizner went there for his health.) On the train he meets the fictitious Hollis Bessemer, with whom he is smitten instantly. Hollis is the son of a wealthy industrialist, cut off by his father for refusing to enter the family business. His real passion is art, and although he is not talented, he dreams of creating an artist colony in Palm Beach with the help of his aunt, who is staying there in a hotel (&quot;Talent&quot;).

Addison shows Hollis&#x27;s aunt a plan for a house he proposes to build for her. Impressed, she agrees and offers to sponsor Hollis&#x27;s artist colony. However, Hollis and Addison, now lovers, are too busy designing resort homes for the rich (&quot;You&quot;) and enjoying each other&#x27;s company (&quot;The Best Thing That Ever Has Happened&quot;) to follow up on Hollis&#x27;s original plan. Wilson arrives at Hollis&#x27;s and Addison&#x27;s house, destitute and sick (&quot;The Game [Reprise]&quot;). Addison reluctantly takes him in, and when Wilson has recovered, he begins to work on Hollis, persuading him to be a patron to his newest scheme: to build a brand new city in Boca Raton with Wilson as promoter and Addison as chief architect (&quot;Addison&#x27;s City&quot;).

Wilson&#x27;s con man instincts resurface. He promotes the Boca Raton real estate scheme with increasingly extravagant and eventually fraudulent claims, creating a price bubble (&quot;Boca Raton&quot;). Addison goes along, until it is Hollis who finally puts a stop to the real-estate scheme. He asks Addison to choose between Wilson and him. Addison, brought to a state of desperation, drives Hollis away by claiming he never loved him. Addison also orders Wilson out of his life (&quot;Get Out&quot;), but Wilson insists Addison loves him too much (&quot;Go&quot;). Addison agrees, but still wants him to go.

Wilson leaves for good, but not quite, for in the finale (as in the first scene) all the characters leave the stage except for Wilson and Addison. At this point, Wilson realizes that he, too, has died. The brothers bicker half-heartedly, their differences no longer mattering enough to keep them apart. Confronted by their father, they shrug off his criticisms and the brothers set out together on the road to eternity—or, as Wilson calls it, &quot;the greatest opportunity of all&quot;. &quot;Sooner or later&quot;, he says, &quot;we&#x27;re bound to get it right.&quot;

==Historical liberties==
Sometimes the musical is mistaken as a faithful portrayal of the lives of the two brothers; this is not quite the case. Sondheim&#x27;s interest in the brothers&#x27; story came from &quot;The Legendary Mizners,&quot; written by Alva Johnston, which Sondheim admits was an &quot;exaggerated biography&quot; and Johnston a &quot;fanciful reporter&quot;. The exaggerated tone was also kept because Sondheim and Weidman felt it suited the two brothers&#x27; attitudes in their own writings, such as Wilson&#x27;s screenplays and Addison&#x27;s autobiography.

While Addison was an architect and Wilson a con man, among other things, Hollis Bessemer is fictitious. In early workshops the character was based on Addison&#x27;s real-life friend Paris Singer, but Singer was not a homosexual and was not Addison&#x27;s lover. In the workshopped &quot;Wise Guys&quot;, Addison&#x27;s sexuality was only hinted at, but Sondheim and Weidman decided they had to address it more openly, and so the character of Hollis was created to give him a love interest. As Sondheim put it, &quot;We wanted to take liberties with our characters, but not misrepresent them. Or be sued by Singer&#x27;s descendants.&quot;

Wilson&#x27;s role in the Boca Raton fiasco is exaggerated, and while he did marry a rich widow, who quickly divorced him, she had not been a client of Addison. Addison never blamed Wilson for all his problems. Mama Mizner was not behind the gold mining adventure by her sons. While Addison did travel considerably, it was not around the world, and it was not the case that part of it was a string of businesses. Addison&#x27;s alleged decision to become an architect so as to build a house for his souvenirs is colorful, but fictitious.

&quot;Wise Guys&quot; and &quot;Bounce&quot; stuck more closely to the facts of the brothers&#x27; lives, including references to their other siblings, their father&#x27;s successful career, and Wilson&#x27;s New York period, but Sondheim and Weidman decided these facts held back the story with what Sondheim called &quot;interesting and irrelevant information&quot;. &quot;In our attempt to cover every colorful incident in the Mizners&#x27; lives we were shortchanging the emotional content of the material: the convoluted love story between the brothers and with their parents.&quot;

==Critical response==
Referring to the 2003 &quot;Bounce&quot; productions, TheaterMania noted the &quot;brace of mixed-to-negative reviews has all but assured that this production of &quot;Bounce&quot; will not be coming to New York.&quot; In November 2003, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported &quot;the show, which received lukewarm reviews in two tryout runs, is not coming to Broadway anytime soon.&quot;

Ben Brantley, in his &quot;New York Times&quot; review of the 2003 Kennedy Center production, said &quot;[It] never seems to leave its starting point...Mr. Kind and Mr. McGillin execute this self-introduction [title song] charmingly, translating wryness and ruefulness into a breezy soft-shoe sensibility. But in a sense, when they have finished the song they have already delivered the whole show...&quot;Bounce,&quot; which features the vibrant Michele Pawk as a zestful gold digger (of both Klondike and jazz-age varieties) and Jane Powell as the Mizners&#x27; mother, only rarely kicks into a higher gear than the one that gently propels the opening duet...their trajectory feels as straight and flat as a time line in a history book. The bounce in &quot;Bounce&quot; is never very high...Much of the music, while whispering of earlier, more flashily complex Sondheim scores, has a conventional surface perkiness that suggests a more old-fashioned, crowd-pleasing kind of show than is this composer&#x27;s wont. But his extraordinary gift for stealthily weaving dark motifs into a brighter musical fabric is definitely in evidence, mellifluously rendered in the peerless Jonathan Tunick&#x27;s orchestrations.&quot;

Brantley, in his review of the 2008 production, praised Cerveris and Gemignani, but declares that, &quot;The problem is that this musical&#x27;s travelogue structure precludes its digging deep. It hints at dark and shimmering glories beneath the surface that it never fully mines. Like its leading characters, &#x27;Road Show&#x27; doesn’t quite know what to do with the riches at its disposal.&quot;

==Recordings==
An original cast recording of the 2003 version (then titled &quot;Bounce&quot;) was released on May 4, 2004 by Nonesuch Records.

An original cast recording of the 2008 Public Theater production was released June 30, 2009 by PS Classics and Nonesuch Records.

<text>Lisa Coles Guerrero (born April 9, 1964) is an American journalist, actress, former sportscaster, artist, and model. Since 2006, Guerrero has been an investigative correspondent for the nationally syndicated newsmagazine &quot;Inside Edition&quot;.

==Early years==
Guerrero was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Walter Coles, an American of English descent, and Lucy Guerrero, who was from Chile. Guerrero spent her childhood living in San Diego, California, and Huntington Beach, California. In 1972, when she was aged eight, her mother died of lymphoma cancer. Lisa is a graduate of Edison High School in Huntington Beach, California which is located in Orange County.

==Career==

===Early career and acting roles===
Guerrero began her show business career in the 1980s as a cheerleader for the Los Angeles Rams, after which she became entertainment director for the Atlanta Falcons and New England Patriots. In the 1990s, she starred in Aaron Spelling&#x27;s &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; as the female jewel thief Francesca Vargas. She also guest-starred on &quot;Frasier&quot; (as Joanne, the woman Frasier meets in the airport and follows onto a plane in the Season 4 finale &quot;Odd Man Out&quot; and Season 5 premiere &quot;Frasier&#x27;s Imaginary Friend&quot;), &quot;Cybill&quot;, &quot;George Lopez&quot; and &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;.

In 1992, Guerrero, billed under her given name Lisa Coles, made a brief appearance in the superhero film &quot;Batman Returns&quot;. Guerrero&#x27;s character, credited as &quot;Volunteer Bimbo&quot;, tells the film&#x27;s villain, Penguin (Danny DeVito), that he is the coolest role model a young person could have. The Penguin retorted by saying that she&#x27;s the hottest young person a role model could have.

In 1997, she became a sports anchor on Los Angeles&#x27; KCBS-TV, and later on KTTV.

===Fox Sports===
In 1999, Lisa Guerrero moved to the Fox Network, where she participated in shows such as &quot;Sports Geniuses&quot;, &quot;Fox Overtime&quot;, &quot;Fox Extra Innings,&quot; and the Toughman competition shows. Guerrero travelled to Egypt to tape the special &quot;Opening the Tombs of the Golden Mummies,&quot; and was the first female host of the San Diego Chargers magazine-style television show. Guerrero also co-hosted &quot;The Best Damn Sports Show Period&quot;, alongside Tom Arnold, John Salley, John Kruk and Michael Irvin.

===&quot;Monday Night Football&quot;===
In 2003, she left &quot;The Best Damn Sports Show Period&quot; to join ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; as a sideline reporter. Guerrero was fired from the &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; team after one season. Two decades later, Guerrero revealed in her book that she had suffered a miscarriage while on the air at MNF.

===&quot;Playboy&quot;===
Guerrero was the celebrity cover model in the January 2006 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, billed on the cover as &quot;The Best Damn Sports Beauty&quot;.

Fifteen years later, Guerrero hosted the &quot;Secrets of Playboy.&quot; The show won the &quot;Critics Choice Award&quot; for &quot;Best Crime and Justice Show&quot; in 2022. Her in-studio sit down interviews with the survivors earned critical praise.

===&quot;Inside Edition&quot;===
On June 15, 2006, Guerrero became a correspondent on the TV news magazine &quot;Inside Edition&quot;. She later became the show&#x27;s chief investigative correspondent and has worked on undercover stories and investigative reports. In 2011, she won the National Headliner Award for Best Investigative Report, beating Anderson Cooper for her undercover exposé on air duct cleaning scams.

Guerrero was nominated for a Prism Award for her story on the dangers of alcohol and boating. She was also nominated for a Genesis Award nomination for her investigation into horse slaughter farms in Florida.

In total, Guerrero has won over 35 national journalism awards and honors since becoming &quot;Inside Edition&#x27;s&quot; chief investigative correspondent in 2010.

===Acting===
Guerrero has appeared in numerous TV and film projects throughout her forty-year career, including a starring role in Aaron Spelling&#x27;s &quot;Sunset Beach&quot;, guest starring on &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;The George Lopez Show&quot;, &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, and a recurring role in TNT&#x27;s television drama series &quot;Southland&quot;. She appeared in &quot;Batman Returns&quot; and was also featured in the Bennet Miller film &quot;Moneyball&quot;, starring Brad Pitt.

Guerrero and her then-husband, retired baseball pitcher Scott Erickson, made an independent film titled &quot;A Plumm Summer&quot; (2007). Guerrero played the lead role and was also credited as executive producer. Guerrero also co-hosted VH1&#x27;s game show &quot;The World Series of Pop Culture&quot;. In 2010, Guerrero hosted the first live webcast of the 82nd Academy Awards red carpet for Oscar.com, integrating viewers&#x27; questions from Facebook into celebrity interviews. In January 2012, Guerrero hosted &quot;Shooting Stars: Salute to Service&quot;, a reality competition show on the Velocity channel.

In total, Guerrero has appeared in 18 film and television projects.

===Author===
Guerrero wrote a memoir titled &quot;Warrior: My Path to Being Brave&quot; which was published by Hachette Books in January 2023.

Guerrero previously wrote the book, &quot;Jewelry For Your Table&quot;, a how-to crafts treatise on table setting, published in 2016.

She has occasionally written a blog for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; sports section and &quot;HuffPost&quot;.

==Personal life==
Guerrero was married to Scott Erickson from 2004 through 2019. In her 2023 book, &quot;Warrior&quot;, Guerrero revealed that an unplanned pregnancy early in her relationship with Erickson ended in a miscarriage, suffered while she was on the sideline reporting for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;.

<text>Adam Guettel (; born December 16, 1964) is an American composer-lyricist of musical theater and opera. The grandson of musical theatre composer Richard Rodgers, he is best known for his musicals &quot;Floyd Collins&quot; (Lucille Lortel Award for Best Musical, Obie Award for Best Music), &quot;The Light in the Piazza&quot;, (Tony Award for Best Original Score and Tony Award for Best Orchestrations), and &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; (Frederick Loewe Award for Dramatic Composition).

==Biography==
===Early years===
Guettel was born on December 16, 1964, to film executive Henry Guettel and writer/composer Mary Rodgers, daughter of famed composer Richard Rodgers, and was raised on the Upper West Side of New York City. He performed as a boy soprano soloist in operas including &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; and &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, both at the Metropolitan Opera and the New York City Opera, and in another production of &quot;Pelléas&quot; with the Santa Fe Opera. He was also slated to play Amahl in the film remake of Gian Carlo Menotti&#x27;s &quot;Amahl and the Night Visitors&quot;. He later claimed that he ended his career as a boy soprano at age 13, by faking that his voice was changing. Guettel played bass guitar in rock groups, but felt he wasn&#x27;t good enough at the instrument, and that even if he was &quot;even a bass solo is not that satisfying. It is like putting a sail on a car.&quot; Soon, turning to musical theatre composition, he was mentored by Stephen Sondheim. Guettel recalled how as a 14-year-old boy he showed Sondheim his work. Guettel was &quot;crestfallen&quot; since he had come in &quot;sort of all puffed up thinking [he] would be rained with compliments and things&quot;, which was not the case since Sondheim had some &quot;very direct things to say&quot;. Later, Sondheim wrote and apologized to Guettel for being &quot;not very encouraging&quot; when he was actually trying to be &quot;constructive&quot;. Years later, Sondheim would later put Guettel&#x27;s song &quot;The Riddle Song&quot; from &quot;Floyd Collins&quot; on his list of &quot;songs he wished he&#x27;d written&quot;. 

Guettel attended Phillips Exeter Academy, School Year Abroad (SYA France) and Interlochen Center for the Arts. He attended Yale University, where he met frequent collaborator, Tina Landau, and connected with another collaborator, who had graduated earlier, Ted Sperling. While at Yale, Guettel took time off from school to work as John Mauceri&#x27;s assistant and the DX7 consultant on the broadway musical &quot;Song and Dance.&quot; 

===Career===
In the 1990s, he developed two projects with Sperling and Landau. The first, &quot;Floyd Collins,&quot; was originally staged at the American Music Theater Festival in Philadelphia, in 1994, where Guettel not only wrote the music and lyrics, but also starred as Floyd&#x27;s brother, Homer. On the subject of adapting the true story of Floyd Collins, Guettel stated &quot;We&#x27;re true to the spirit of the story, but we are circling it for the most dramatic angle&quot;. The musical opened at Playwrights Horizons on February 9, 1996. In The New York Times review of the show, critic Ben Brantley noted &quot;Mr. Guettel establishes himself as a young composer of strength and sophistication, weaving strands from the Americana of Copland and the uneasy dissonance of Sondheim&quot;. Later, Guettel would say that it was his time working on &quot;Floyd&quot; which made him certain that he would spend his life writing music for the theatre.

The second project he developed with Landau and Sperling was a song cycle titled &quot;Saturn Returns&quot; (recorded as &quot;Myths and Hymns&quot;). The piece musicalizes pieces of mythology, including the stories of Hero and Leander, Icarus, Medusa, as well as classic hymns. Discussing its genesis, Guettel stated &quot;I had been writing these myths just because I was just starting out as a writer, and you don&#x27;t know what to write. I did stuff that was tried and true. That was enough to keep me busy. Then I came across this book in an old antique shop... And it was just the words to a bunch of hymns... For some reason out of this Upper West Side Jew comes all of this music to these hymn lyrics&quot;. At first, Guettel was adapting the hymns and myths as separate projects, until Landau suggested they would work well together. &quot;And we realized in some ways that the hymns are who we would have ourselves be, and the myths are basically who we are, and that they can kind of antiphonally talk to each other&quot;, said Guettel, in a 2021 New York Times interview on the online MasterVoices production of the piece. The piece was performed at The Public Theater and was later recorded by Nonesuch records with performances by Billy Porter, Mandy Patinkin, Kristin Chenoweth, and Guettel himself.

Other early works include an adaptation of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, &quot;Love&#x27;s Fire,&quot; and more. Early on, Guettel&#x27;s music was almost immediately characterized by its complexity and chromaticism. His major influences include Igor Stravinsky, Maurice Ravel, Claude Debussy, Benjamin Britten, and Stevie Wonder. Stephen Sondheim has referred to Guettel&#x27;s work as &quot;dazzling.&quot; Guettel&#x27;s songs have been recorded by such artists as Audra McDonald and Brian d&#x27;Arcy James. He also contributed original scores to several documentary films, including &quot;Arguing the World&quot; and &quot;&quot;. In 1999, he performed a concert evening of his own work at New York&#x27;s Town Hall.

In 2004, Guettel contributed vocals to Jessica Molaskey&#x27;s P.S. Classics album &quot;Make Believe&quot;, dueting with Molaskey on his grandfather&#x27;s song &quot;Glad To Be Unhappy&quot;.

After &quot;Floyd Collins,&quot; Guettel reportedly hoped to work on a love story. His mother suggested an adaptation that she had once pitched to her father- &quot;The Light in the Piazza&quot; by Elizabeth Spencer. After six years working on the project, Guettel&#x27;s musical &quot;The Light in the Piazza&quot; opened on Broadway in 2005. The show, which starred Victoria Clark and Kelli O&#x27;Hara, met with mixed critical notices, but on June 5, 2005, Adam Guettel won the Tony Award for Best Original Score and the Tony Award for Best Orchestrations.

He spent much of the period from 2005 to 2007 working on a musical adaptation of &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; with original screenwriter William Goldman. As of January 2007, Guettel had written the music for ten songs for the project. An orchestral suite from the score was performed at the Hollywood Bowl in November 2006, and Lincoln Center conducted a workshop of &quot;Bride&quot; in January 2007. The project was abandoned when Goldman reportedly demanded 75 percent of the author&#x27;s share, even though Guettel was writing both the music and the lyrics.

Guettel also writes incidental music for plays, as well as film scores. He has written music for plays including &quot;The Legend of Oedipus&quot; (1988) and &quot;Lydie Breeze&quot; (2000). In summer 2007, Guettel composed incidental music for a production of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s play &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; at the Intiman Playhouse in Seattle, Washington. In 2019, Guettel&#x27;s score for Aaron Sorkin&#x27;s play &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; was nominated for a Tony Award.

In July 2009, the Signature Theatre of Arlington, Virginia, commissioned Guettel to write a new musical for their 2011–2012 season, under the auspices of their American Musical Voices Project. Currently in the works, this will be a musical adaptation of the Danny Boyle film &quot;Millions&quot;. Other current projects include an opera based on the short stories of Washington Irving and the opera, &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, commissioned by the Houston Grand Opera.

In January 2023, Atlantic Theater Company announced an eight-week world premiere production of Guettel&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Days of Wine and Roses,&quot; with music, lyrics, and orchestrations by Guettel, book by Craig Lucas (Guettel&#x27;s collaborator on &quot;The Light in the Piazza,&quot; almost 20 years previously), and direction by Michael Greif. The production starred Kelli O&#x27;Hara and Brian D&#x27;Arcy James and was the first full production of a new musical by Guettel since &quot;Piazza.&quot;&quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; moved to Broadway, premiering on January 6, 2024 for a 16-week run.

Shortly after &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; closed on Broadway, it was announced that Guettel&#x27;s musical, &quot;Millions&quot; would make its world premiere at the Alliance Theater. The production will be directed by Guettel&#x27;s longtime collaborator, Bartlett Sher. 

In June 2024, it was announced that &quot;Floyd Collins&quot; would come to Broadway as a part of Lincoln Center Theater&#x27;s 40th Anniversary season. 

Another major aspect of Guettel&#x27;s career is his work as a teacher. Since 1995, he has taught masterclasses and seminars in musical theatre performance and songwriting, considering this to be an important complement to his work as a composer. He has led such classes at DePauw University, DePaul University, New York University, Pace University, Harvard University, Yale University, Princeton University, Emerson College, Elon University, The Boston Conservatory, Southern Methodist University, Syracuse University, Wagner College and many others.

Guettel received an honorary doctorate from Lehman College in 2007, and was made an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Music in 2019.

==Family==
Guettel is the son of composer, author and Juilliard School chairman Mary Rodgers, who died on June 26, 2014, and grandson of legendary musical theater composer Richard Rodgers. His father, Henry Guettel (died October 7, 2013), was a film executive and was the executive director of the Theatre Development Fund.

When Guettel took up music composition in his mid-teens, he was encouraged by his family. His mother said that she offered him advice for around a year. &quot;After that, he was so far beyond anything I could ever have dreamed of, I just backed off.&quot; Richard Rodgers, who died when Guettel was 15, overheard an early composition, said he liked it, and asked him to play it louder. Guettel has qualified the compliment, noting that &quot;He was literally on his deathbed on the other side of the living-room wall.&quot; In his high school and collegiate years and into his early twenties, Guettel worked as a rock and jazz musician, singing and playing bass, before realizing &quot;that writing for character and telling stories through music was something that I really loved to do, and that allowed me to express love&quot;.

== Influences ==
In an interview, Guettel stated a portion of his influences that included I. M. Pei, Louis Kahn, Vincent Scully, Jane Jacobs, Igor Stravinsky, Stevie Wonder, Adam de la Halle, Harry Nilsson, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Björk, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Benjamin Britten, William Inge, Stephen Sondheim, Jody Williams, and Marvin Gaye.

<text>The Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour, also known as the Stephen Leacock Medal for Humour or just the Leacock Medal, is an annual Canadian literary award presented for the best book of humour written in English by a Canadian writer, published or self-published in the previous year. The silver medal, designed by sculptor Emanuel Hahn, is a tribute to well-known Canadian humorist Stephen Leacock (1869–1944) and is accompanied by a cash prize of . It is presented in the late spring or early summer each year, during a banquet ceremony in or near Leacock’s hometown of Orillia, Ontario.

The medal is one of the oldest literary prizes in Canada and is the only one awarded to a work of humour. It has been awarded every year since 1947 with the exception of 1959 when it was reported that no worthy entries had been submitted.

==History==
The &quot;Stephen Leacock Associates&quot;, the non-profit organising body behind the award, was founded in 1946 by a loose group of Leacock’s friends and supporters. Although administered and presented separately today, the award was announced as part of the Governor General&#x27;s Awards in its early years. 

Each year the Associates’ board of directors appoints a panel of suitable judges from around the country, and also commissions readers who rank and select from submitted works a long list of ten books, which is later narrowed to a short list of three books (previously five). The shortlist is typically announced in early May. In 1990, for the only time in the award&#x27;s history they did not whittle the initial longlist down to a shortlist but simply announced a shortlist of ten books which were all considered for the final award.

The cash prize began in 1970, as a $2,500 award co-sponsored by Manulife Insurance and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. The following decades saw gradual increases in the amount of the prize under a number of sponsors, reaching its current value of $15,000 in 2009, sponsored by the TD Bank Financial Group. As of 2018, both remaining shortlist authors each receive cash prizes of $3,000.

In 1969 the Associates established a quarterly newsletter called &quot;The Newspacket&quot; to commemorate the centenary of the author’s birth. The publication prints excerpts from nominated books, and is itself a showcase for Canadian humour writing. The Newspacket has been published irregularly in recent years.

In 1977 the group established an annual Student Award for Humour, which honours and encourages young Canadian writers from secondary and post-secondary levels with recognition and cash prizes for the top three.

==Organization==
The Leacock Award is ceremonially led by a past winner or nominee, who holds the honorary title &quot;Mayor of Mariposa&quot;. The duties of this position include giving a speech at the awards ceremony, and representing the Leacock Foundation in other public appearances including McGill University&#x27;s annual Leacock Lecture. Held by Dan Needles until 2018, the position was taken over by Drew Hayden Taylor in 2019 and renamed &quot;Grand Chief of Mariposa&quot; to reflect Taylor&#x27;s First Nations heritage. Subsequently, the 2011 Leacock Medal winner Trevor Cole served as the Honorary Mayor for two years with the 1993 medalist John Levesque selected to assume the post in 2025.

== The Medal ==

The medal, cast in silver and designed by Canadian sculptor Emanuel Hahn, is two inches (5.08 cm) in diameter and approximately 0.125 inches (.32 cm) thick. It weighs 3.125 ounces (88.59 g).

On the obverse is a profile of Stephen Leacock’s head and the dates of his lifespan (1869–1944). The words &quot;Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal Founded 1946&quot; are worked around the perimeter.

The reverse side features the words &quot;Orillia “The Sunshine Town” Award for Canadian Humour&quot;. A jolly face represents the sun resting on waves, and the latitude and longitude of Orillia, Ontario, Canada, appear in small figures at the top. Two small fish swim beneath the waves, and two large mosquitoes are depicted — one on the sun, the other in the water. Below the design, there is room for the winner’s name and date to be inscribed, and below that a small maple leaf emblem.

<doc id="263518" wikidata="Q2657536" url="?curid=263518" title="Battle of Boroughbridge">
<text>The Battle of Boroughbridge was fought on 16 March 1322 in England between a group of rebellious barons and the forces of King Edward II, near Boroughbridge, north-west of York. The culmination of a long period of antagonism between the King and Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, his most powerful subject, it resulted in Lancaster&#x27;s defeat and execution, ending the Despenser War. This allowed Edward to re-establish royal authority and hold on to power for almost five more years.

Though not a part of the Wars of Scottish Independence, the battle is significant for its employment of tactics learned in the Scottish wars in a domestic, English conflict. Both the extensive use of foot soldiers rather than cavalry and the heavy impact caused by the longbow represented significant steps in military developments.

==Background==
Edward II was a weak and ineffectual king (made to look the more so by comparison with his father and son, Edward I and Edward III), and his reign was marked by military failure and internal strife. A great number of the barons turned against the King and Thomas of Lancaster eventually became the leader of the opposition. Lancaster was Edward&#x27;s cousin and next to the King was the richest man in the country. Through a set of regulations known as the Ordinances, Lancaster and his associates had been trying to put restrictions on royal authority, but by the late 1310s Edward was again in full control of central government. The situation was aggravated by the King&#x27;s ostentatious patronage of his favourite, Hugh Despenser, and Hugh&#x27;s father by the same name.

In 1319 the King and Lancaster fell out during a failed campaign against Scotland. The next year Lancaster refused to attend a parliament summoned by the King, and later the same year Edward obtained papal absolution from his oath to follow the Ordinances. Meanwhile an inheritance dispute had broken out in the Welsh Marches between the Despensers and certain marcher lords, including Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford. Lancaster now took the initiative with the discontented. In 1321 he summoned two meetings of magnates, one at Lancaster&#x27;s residence of Pontefract in March and the other at Sherburn in June. The meetings consisted of northern and marcher lords as well as Lancaster&#x27;s own retainers, but little assistance was forthcoming from the northerners. The marcher rebellion and the threat of civil war forced the King to exile the younger Despenser, but the favourite was recalled within weeks.

Edward now seized the initiative and moved northwards. Lancaster convened one final meeting at Doncaster in November and also entered into an alliance with Robert I of Scotland to strengthen his hand against the King. In January 1322 Edward crossed the River Severn and secured the surrender of several of the marcher lords while Lancaster remained passive. As the royal army crossed the River Trent after the Battle of Burton Bridge Lancaster was forced to flee north. On 16 March Lancaster and his army had reached Boroughbridge by the River Ure, where they were joined by the Earl&#x27;s Secretary, Sir Robert de Holland, and the force he had raised in Lancashire. There they were cut off by the forces of Sir Andrew Harclay, a veteran of the Scottish wars, who had gathered the levies from the counties of Cumberland and Westmorland.

==Battle==

When Lancaster arrived at the town of Boroughbridge, Harclay was already in possession of the bridge over the river. The rebel forces counted probably no more than 700 knights and men-at-arms against the 4,000 or so soldiers in the royal army. Lancaster initially tried to negotiate but Harclay could not be swayed. Since there was no realistic alternative place to cross the river and with the royal forces in pursuit from the south, the rebels had no choice but to fight. The ensuing battle was short and one-sided.

Harclay had deployed his men on foot to hold the bridge from the northern side. Additional forces were placed at a nearby ford, though contemporary sources do not specify the exact location of this ford. The royal pikemen were deployed in a schiltron formation, a tactic learned from the Scots in the Scottish wars. The formation proved effective against the oncoming cavalry. The rebels divided into two columns; one led by Hereford and Roger de Clifford, attacking the bridge on foot, the other under Lancaster, trying to cross the ford by horse. According to a graphic description in the chronicle the &quot;Brut&quot;, Hereford was killed as he crossed the bridge by a pikeman hiding underneath, who thrust his spear up through the earl&#x27;s anus. Clifford was also severely injured, and that column of the army fell into disarray. Lancaster&#x27;s party fared little better; under heavy archery fire his cavalry was cut off before it even reached the ford, and was forced to retreat. This event shows an early—if not entirely novel—effective use of the longbow against cavalry, a tactic which was to become central to future English military success.

Lancaster negotiated a truce with Harclay, and withdrew to the town. During the night a great number of the rebels deserted, and the next day the sheriff of York arrived from the south with additional forces. Lancaster, now greatly outnumbered and with no chance of retreat, had no choice but to surrender to Harclay.

==Aftermath==

Thomas of Lancaster was taken to Pontefract Castle, which by then had fallen to the King. There he was submitted to what was little more than a show trial and—in front of a gathering of earls and barons—sentenced to death. On 22 March 1322 he was led out of the castle and beheaded in front of a jeering crowd. Subsequently a cult emerged around the person of the late earl as a martyr and even a possible saint. Lancaster had shown no signs of extraordinary piety nor other personal abilities during his lifetime and the cult has been interpreted as a reaction to the incompetent and oppressive reign of Edward II.

Some thirty of Lancaster&#x27;s followers were also executed, among these Clifford and the baron John Mowbray. Clifford was hung from Clifford&#x27;s Tower in York, which is now named after him.

Andrew Harclay was richly rewarded for his loyal and competent performance at Boroughbridge. On 25 March he was created Earl of Carlisle and promised lands worth 1,000 marks yearly. Yet Harclay, who had turned down Lancaster&#x27;s overtures to join in the rebellion, was no great adherent of the King. As a warden of the Scottish Marches he grew constantly more frustrated with the King&#x27;s idleness, and eventually negotiated a peace treaty with the Scots. This action on Harclay&#x27;s part amounted to treason and early in 1323 he was apprehended by the King&#x27;s men and hanged, drawn and quartered.

As for Edward II himself, his dependence on the Despensers grew only deeper and their transgressions more severe. Lancaster&#x27;s supporters (including Roger Mortimer, William Trussell and Robert de Holland) found themselves systematically accused of false charges, being imprisoned and having their lands taken over by the Despensers. Mortimer and Trussell eventually fled to Paris, where they were to be joined by Edward&#x27;s estranged wife, Isabella, who may have become Mortimer&#x27;s lover.

In 1327 Isabella and Mortimer staged a coup against the King. Edward II was deposed and his son, Edward III, succeeded him.

<doc id="263521" wikidata="Q646795" url="?curid=263521" title="MorphOS">
<text>MorphOS is an AmigaOS-like operating system designed for Power and PowerPC based computers. The core, based on the Quark microkernel, is proprietary, although several libraries and other parts are open source, such as the Ambient desktop.

The project began in 1999 and it was produced for the Pegasos computer, as well as PowerUP accelerator equipped Amiga computers, and a series of Freescale development boards that use the Genesi firmware, including the Efika and mobileGT. Since then MorphOS has been ported to Apple&#x27;s Mac mini, eMac, Power Mac G4 and limited support for Power Mac G5. It is binary compatible with software written for Motorola 68k-based Amiga computers.

==History==
The project began in 1999, based on the Quark microkernel. The earliest versions of MorphOS ran only via PPC accelerator cards on the Amiga computers, and required portions of AmigaOS to fully function. A collaborative effort between the companies bPlan (of which the lead MorphOS developer is a partner) and Thendic-France in 2002 resulted in the first regular, non-prototype production of bPlan-engineered Pegasos computers capable of running MorphOS or Linux. Thendic-France had financial problems and folded; however, the collaboration continued under the new banner of &quot;Genesi&quot;. A busy promotional year followed in 2003, with appearances at conventions and exhibitions in several places around the world, including the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.

After some bitter disagreements within the MorphOS development team in 2003 and 2004, culminating with accusations by a MorphOS developer that he and others had not been paid, the Ambient desktop interface was released under GPL and is now actively developed by the Ambient development team. Subject to GPL rules, Ambient continues to be included in the commercial MorphOS product. An alternative MorphOS desktop system is &quot;Scalos&quot;.

==Characteristics and versions==
Developed for PowerPC CPUs from Freescale and IBM, it also supports the original AmigaOS Motorola 68000 series (68k, MC680x0) applications via proprietary task-based emulation, and most AmigaOS PPC applications via API wrappers. It is API compatible with AmigaOS 3.1 and has a GUI based on the Magic User Interface (MUI).

Besides the Pegasos version of MorphOS, there is a version for Amiga computers equipped with PowerUP accelerator cards produced by Phase5. This version is free, as is registration. If unregistered, it slows down after each two-hour session. PowerUP MorphOS was most recently updated on 23 February 2006; however, it does not exceed the feature set or advancement of the Pegasos release.

A version of MorphOS for the Efika, a very small mainboard based on the ultra-low-power MPC5200B processor from Freescale, has been shown at exhibitions and user gatherings in Germany. Current (since 2.0) release of MorphOS supports the Efika.

=== Software ===

MorphOS can run any system friendly Amiga software written for 68k processors. Also it is possible to use 68k libraries or datatypes on PPC applications and vice versa. It also provides compatibility layer for PowerUP and WarpUP software written for PowerUP accelerator cards. The largest repository is Aminet with over 75,000 packages online with packages from all Amiga flavors including music, sound, and artwork. MorphOS-only software repositories are hosted at MorphOS software, MorphOS files and MorphOS Storage. MorphOS is delivered with several desktop applications in the form of pre-installed software.

==Components==
===ABox===
ABox is an emulation sandbox featuring a PPC native AmigaOS API clone that is binary compatible with both 68k Amiga applications and both PowerUP and WarpOS formats of Amiga PPC executables. ABox is based in part on AROS Research Operating System. ABox includes Trance JIT code translator for 68k native Amiga applications.

===Other===
* AHI – audio interface: 6.7
* Ambient – the default MorphOS desktop, inspired by Workbench and Directory Opus 5
* CyberGraphX – graphics interface originally developed for Amiga computers: 5.1
* Magic User Interface – primary graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit: 4.2
* Poseidon – the Amiga USB stack developed by Chris Hodges
* TurboPrint – the printing system
* TinyGL – OpenGL implementation and Warp3D compatibility is featured via Rendering Acceleration Virtual Engine (RAVE) low-level API: V 51
* Quark – manages the low level systems and hosts the A/Box currently
===Ambient===
Ambient is the built-in MUI-based desktop environment for MorphOS, the development was started in 2001 by David Gerber. Its main goals were that it should be fully asynchronous, simple and fast. Ambient remotely resembles Workbench and Directory Opus Magellan trying to mix the best of both worlds.

====Features====

Ambient does not strictly follow the Amiga Workbench interface paradigm but there are still many similarities: while programs are called tools, program attributes are called tooltypes, data files are projects and directories are drawers.

* support for ARexx scripting language
* default icon library for hundreds of fileformats
* fully asynchronous, multi-threaded design
* fast asynchronous file I/O functions and file notifications
* support for PNG and other Amiga icon formats
* built-in icon, workbench and wbstart libraries
* built-in applications like disk formatting and commodities manager
* panels which are used as program launchers

Ambient is localised for various languages and while it is an intrinsic part of MorphOS, it is also available separately. There are various visual effects in Ambient that take advantage of hardware accelerated visual effects within MorphOS.

====Desktop icons====
The native icon format in Ambient is PNG, but there is built-in support for other Amiga icon formats. Ambient introduced a special icon format called DataType Icons where the icon is simply any image file renamed to include the &quot;.info&quot; extension. Those icons are read using the Amiga DataType system.

====Development status====
In 2005, David Gerber released Ambient source code under GPL and it is now developed by the Ambient development team.

==Supported hardware==
* Max. 1.72 GB RAM; virtual memory is not supported.
* Only Radeon cards have support; Nvidia cards are not supported.

===Amiga===
* Amiga 1200 with Blizzard PPC accelerator card
* Amiga 3000 with CyberStorm PPC accelerator card

== Version history ==

===Release history of 0.x/1.x series===
===Release history of 2.x/3.x series===
MorphOS 2 includes a native TCP/IP stack (&quot;Netstack&quot;) and a Web browser, Sputnik or Origyn Web Browser. Sputnik was begun under a user community bounty system that also resulted in MOSNet, a free, separate TCP/IP stack for MorphOS 1 users. Sputnik is a port of the KHTML rendering engine, on which WebKit is also based. Sputnik is no longer being developed and was removed from later MorphOS 2 releases.

<doc id="263523" wikidata="Q2915442" url="?curid=263523" title="Café wall illusion">
<text>The café wall illusion (also known as the Münsterberg illusion or the kindergarten illusion) is a geometrical-optical illusion in which the parallel straight dividing lines between staggered rows with alternating dark and light rectangles (such as bricks or tiles) appear to be sloped, not parallel as they really are.

The phenomenon has been rediscovered several times. A version of the illusion was first described by Hugo Münsterberg in 1894, then described as the &#x27;kindergarten illusion&#x27; in 1898 by A. H. Pierce, and under its current name in 1973 by Richard Gregory. According to Gregory, this effect was observed by a member of his laboratory, Steve Simpson, in the tiles of the wall of a café at the bottom of St Michael&#x27;s Hill, Bristol.

In the construction of the illusion often each &quot;brick&quot; is surrounded by a layer of &quot;mortar&quot; intermediate between the dark and light colours of the &quot;bricks&quot;.

In attempts at its deconstruction, the illusion was ascribed largely to the irradiation illusion (apparent greater size of a white area than of a black one), and the image disappears when black and white are replaced by different colours of the same brightness. But a component of the illusion remains even when all optical and retinal components are factored out. Contrast polarities seem to be the determining factor in the tilt&#x27;s direction.

<doc id="263526" wikidata="Q1786825" url="?curid=263526" title="Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle">
<text>Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle (c. 1270 – 3 March 1323), alternatively Andreas de Harcla, was an important English military leader in the borderlands with Scotland during the reign of Edward II. Coming from a knightly family in Westmorland, he was appointed sheriff of Cumberland in 1311. He distinguished himself in the Scottish Wars, and in 1315 repulsed a siege on Carlisle Castle by Robert the Bruce. Shortly after this, he was taken captive by the Scots, and only released after a substantial ransom had been paid. His greatest achievement came in 1322, when he defeated the rebellious baron Thomas of Lancaster at the Battle of Boroughbridge on 16–17 March. For this he was created Earl of Carlisle.

As one of the main military leaders on the border to Scotland, Harclay became frustrated with Edward II&#x27;s inactivity, particularly the humiliating English defeat at the Battle of Old Byland on 14 October 1322, which made it clear that the war could not be won. Harclay initiated negotiations with the Scots on his own accord, and on 3 January 1323, he signed a peace treaty with Robert the Bruce. The act was without royal sanction, and amounted to treason. The king issued an arrest order for the earl, and on 25 February Harclay was taken into the king&#x27;s custody. He was arraigned before royal justices on 3 March, denied a hearing, and executed the same day. He was hanged, drawn and quartered, and the various parts of his body displayed in different parts of the country. His alleged treason, capture and execution is described in the Lanercost Chronicle. Only after five years was he allowed a proper burial, but the conviction for treason was never annulled.

==Family and early career==
The family name of Harclay derives from Hartley in Westmorland. Though relatively little is known about his early years, Andrew Harclay was probably the eldest son of Sir Michael Harclay and Joan, daughter of the Yorkshire landowner William Fitzjohn. His younger brother was the theologian Henry Harclay, a Chancellor of the University of Oxford. Michael Harclay was a retainer of the Clifford family, and served as sheriff of Cumberland from 1285 to 1296. The first documented appearance of Andrew Harclay was at a Westmorland eyre in 1292, at which point it must be assumed that he was at least twenty-one years old, and therefore born in the early 1270s.

==Military career==
His military career can be traced back as far as 1304 when he took part in a campaign in the Scottish Wars. In 1309, he received a royal order to assist Robert de Clifford in the defence of the Marches against Scotland. His standing in local affairs was further advanced in 1311, when he was appointed sheriff of Cumberland, like his father had been before him. This was followed by his election as Knight of the Shire in 1312, and in December 1313, he distinguished himself as the leader of the defence against a Scottish invasion. He received further acclaim in the summer of 1315, when he successfully defended Carlisle Castle against a siege by Robert the Bruce. For this he was awarded a gift of 1000 marks from the king.

Late in 1315 or in 1316, Harclay was taken captive by the Scots, who demanded 2000 marks in ransom. His meteoric rise over the previous years had made him some enemies in local society, who now took the opportunity to spread slanderous rumours about him at court. The king nevertheless helped raise the necessary money to secure Harclay&#x27;s freedom, but for the next few years he seems to have been out of royal favour. It was not until 1319 that he once more was appointed sheriff, and at the same time made keeper of Carlisle and Cockermouth castles, and Warden of the West Marches. In 1321 he also received a personal summons to parliament.

==Boroughbridge==

Harclay&#x27;s most prominent achievement came with the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322. The battle was the culmination of an ongoing struggle between King Edward II and his most powerful earl, Thomas of Lancaster. The conflict stemmed from disagreement over the handling of the war with Scotland; Lancaster, and many others, found the king&#x27;s war effort lacking. After failing to incite an insurrection against the king, Lancaster was in March 1322 fleeing northwards from the royal army. Meanwhile, Harclay, as sheriff of Cumberland, was ordered by the king to levy the forces of the northern counties of Cumberland and Westmorland, and move south. His orders were to meet up with the royal army, but while stopping at the town of Ripon in Yorkshire, he received intelligence that Lancaster would arrive at nearby Boroughbridge the next day. Harclay decided to take the initiative, and occupy the bridge that would prevent Lancaster&#x27;s passage across the River Ure.

Lancaster&#x27;s army arrived at Boroughbridge on 16 March. The rebels were greatly outnumbered; while Harclay commanded around 4000 men, Lancaster only had some 700 knights and men-at-arms, with followers, in his service. In addition to this, the loyalist forces were highly trained and experienced from the Scottish Wars. Harclay used tactics the English had learned from the Scots in these wars. The Lanercost Chronicle describes how Harclay employed the Scottish &quot;schiltron&quot; – a compact formation of infantrymen with pikes or spears, highly effective against Lancaster&#x27;s cavalry-heavy forces. According to &quot;The Brut&quot;, Lancaster tried to persuade Harclay to join his side, in return for great rewards in land. Harclay had previously been a supporter of Lancaster, possibly also the earl&#x27;s retainer; in 1318, a general royal pardon for Lancaster and his adherents contained Harclay&#x27;s name. On this occasion, however, Harclay decided to remain loyal to the king, and turned down the earl&#x27;s offer.

The engagement was short and one-sided. Lancaster&#x27;s plan was to charge across a ford in the river, while the Earl of Hereford – one of the few magnates who had remained loyal to Lancaster – crossed the bridge. Hereford was killed on the bridge, his companion Roger de Clifford, 2nd Baron de Clifford was badly wounded, and this advance failed. Lancaster, meanwhile, came under such heavy archery fire that he had to call off his attack. Defections during the night, combined with royal reinforcements, forced him to surrender the next day, and on 22 March he was executed. The king was greatly pleased with Harclay&#x27;s effort, and rewarded him lavishly. On 25 March, Harclay was created Earl of Carlisle, and given land worth 1000 marks a year. On 15 September, he was also made chief Warden of the Marches.

==Treason==

On 14 October 1322, the English army was routed by the Scots, under the command of Robert the Bruce, at the Battle of Old Byland in Yorkshire. The English commander, John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond, was taken prisoner. King Edward, who did not take part in the battle, was fifteen miles away at Rievaulx Abbey. When he heard the news he fled to York leaving behind the Great Seal of England and a large amount of treasure. It was the worst defeat the English had suffered in the wars since the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Harclay had received a summons to join the royal army, but had not been able to bring his troops south in time to come to Richmond&#x27;s rescue. The event convinced him that the war against Scotland could not be won under the leadership of the present king. Instead he entered into direct negotiations with the Scots, without the king&#x27;s sanction. On 3 January 1323, he signed a peace treaty with Robert the Bruce at Lochmaben.

The treaty recognised Scotland as an independent kingdom. It stipulated that Robert was to pay 40,000 marks to the English, and that Edward should be allowed to choose a wife from his own family for Robert&#x27;s heir. Implied in the text, however, was an alliance between Robert and Harclay to use force against Edward, if necessary, to implement the terms of the treaty. It seems unlikely that Harclay expected royal clemency for his actions. More likely he contemplated a defection to the side of Robert the Bruce; rumour had it he even planned marrying one of Bruce&#x27;s daughters, however there is no evidence of this. It is nevertheless likely that his action grew out of genuine concern with the northern situation, and was a desperate attempt to make the best out of a disastrous situation.

Though historians have generally shown understanding for Harclay&#x27;s actions, it is nevertheless common to refer to the event as &quot;Harclay&#x27;s treason&quot;. In the words of Maurice Keen: &quot;To make a truce, or to indeed to give safe-conducts or make any agreement with the king&#x27;s enemies without proper grant of powers, again constituted lèse majesté and can be found defined as such in other military cases&quot;. Harclay had received such powers in February 1322, but he was considered to have overstepped his prerogative by the 1323 treaty. It is also possible that Edward held a grudge against Harclay for the latter&#x27;s failure to come to the rescue at Byland, and that this was behind the king&#x27;s later, severe reaction. There is, however, no evidence that Harclay received the royal letter in time to arrive at the battlefield any earlier than he did.

==Death and aftermath==
When Edward found out about Harclay&#x27;s treason, he issued an order for the earl&#x27;s arrest. As Harclay attempted to garner support for his cause, the king began to fortify the northern castles. The stalemate lasted until 25 February, when Sir Anthony Lucy arrested the earl at Carlisle Castle. Lucy, who acted with only a small force, was clearly trusted by Harclay, so the arrest must have been conducted as a surprise manoeuvre. The enmity between Lucy and Harclay could stem from a dispute over the honour of Papcastle. In 1322, Harclay had also briefly disseised Lucy of his lands after the 1322 rebellion, even though Lucy had taken no part in that event.

On 3 March, Harclay was arraigned before a royal justice in Carlisle, but was denied a proper hearing. He was brought forward apparelled in his robes of estate as a knight and earl. His spurs of knighthood were hewed off, and his sword was broken over his head. He was stripped of his robes, and proclaimed to be no knight, but a knave. He was then convicted as a traitor, and condemned to be hanged, drawn and quartered. He behaved with dignity at his execution, where he maintained that he had acted as he did out of concern for the best interest of the country. After his death, his head was taken to the king at Knaresborough in Yorkshire, before it was hung up on London Bridge. The four parts of his body were dispersed around the country, and displayed in Carlisle, Newcastle, Bristol, and Dover.

Harclay&#x27;s head was on display in London for five years before it was taken down. His sister petitioned the king to return the various parts of the body for a Christian burial, and in 1328 her request was granted. Further clemencies were not awarded. In the reign of Edward III, Harclay&#x27;s nephew Henry petitioned to have the charge of treason annulled, but the petition was ignored. As for the peace treaty, the wisdom of Harclay&#x27;s policy was vindicated after his death. Edward II&#x27;s inability to win the war against the Scots, combined with his refusal to give up his claim on the Scottish crown, proved untenable in the end. Furthermore, it was Harclay&#x27;s military skills and well-organised forces that gave what little protection the northern borders had over the previous years. Less than three months after Harclay&#x27;s execution, Edward agreed on a thirteen-year truce with Scotland.

==Harclay in fiction==
Harclay&#x27;s unauthorised negotiations with Robert the Bruce are dealt with in some significant detail in &quot;The Price of the King&#x27;s Peace&quot;, the third volume of Nigel Tranter&#x27;s Bruce trilogy, where he is called &quot;Andrew Harcla&quot;.

<text>We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families: Stories from Rwanda is a 1998 non-fiction book by &quot;The New Yorker&quot; writer Philip Gourevitch about the 1994 Rwandan genocide, in which an estimated one million Tutsi, Hutu, and Twa were killed.

== Summary ==
The book describes Gourevitch&#x27;s travels in Rwanda after the Rwandan genocide, in which he interviews survivors and gathers information. Gourevitch retells survivors&#x27; stories, and reflects on the meaning of the genocide.

The title comes from an April 15, 1994, letter written to Pastor Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, president of the Seventh-day Adventist Church&#x27;s operations in western Rwanda, by seven Adventist pastors who had taken refuge with other Tutsis in an Adventist hospital in the locality of Mugonero in Kibuye prefecture. Gourevitch accused Ntakirutimana of aiding the killings that happened in the complex the next day. Ntakirutimana was eventually convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The book not only explains the genocide&#x27;s peak in 1994, but the history of Rwanda leading up to the major events.

== Reception and criticism ==
&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the book out of &quot;Love It&quot;, &quot;Pretty Good&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot;, and &quot;Rubbish&quot;: &quot;Independent&quot;, &quot;Observer&quot;, and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; reviews under &quot;Love It&quot; and &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, and &quot;Literary Review&quot; reviews under &quot;Pretty Good&quot; and &quot;Spectator&quot; review under &quot;Ok&quot;.

This book won numerous awards, including the 1998 National Book Critics Circle Award, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Book Prize, the 1999 Guardian First Book Award and the George Polk Award for Foreign Reporting.

Africanist René Lemarchand criticizes the book:
What is missing from Gourevitch&#x27;s account is the how and why of the killings. It is one thing to describe the horror, another to explain the motivations that occasioned the carnage. ... The absence of attention to the history of the country creates a portrait of a genocide that is insensitive to the complexity of the circumstances. In essence, Gourevitch&#x27;s story reduces the butchery to the tale of bad guys and good guys, innocent victims and avatars of hate. His frame of reference is the Holocaust.

The book was featured as one of the first Brotherhood 2.0 book club books. In 2019, it was ranked by &quot;Slate&quot; as one of the 50 best nonfiction books of the past 25 years.

<text>Jacques Godbout, OC, CQ (born November 27, 1933) is a Canadian novelist, essayist, children&#x27;s writer, journalist, filmmaker and poet. By his own admission a bit of a dabbler (&quot;touche-à-tout&quot;), Godbout has become one of the most important writers of his generation, with a major influence on post-1960 Quebec intellectual life.

==Biography==
Born in Montreal, Quebec, after studies at Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf and the Université de Montréal, Godbout taught French in Ethiopia before joining the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) as producer and scriptwriter in 1958.

He was active during Quebec&#x27;s Quiet Revolution during which time he wrote a number of penetrating essays, the most important of which were collected in &quot;Le Réformiste&quot; (1975) and &quot;Le Murmure marchand&quot; (1984).

Godbout was a co-founder of &quot;Liberté&quot; (1959), the Mouvement laïque de la langue française (1962) and the Union des écrivains Québécois (1977). Godbout&#x27;s films include four full-length features and more than 15 documentaries. He has also written nine novels for adults and two for children. Godbout currently writes a monthly column in the Quebec newsmagazine &quot;L&#x27;actualité&quot;.

Godbout lives in Outremont, a former city now in Montreal. He is the grand-nephew of former Quebec Premier Adélard Godbout.

Godbout&#x27;s novel &quot;Une histoire américaine&quot; (1986) was chosen for inclusion in the French version of &quot;Canada Reads&quot;, broadcast on Radio-Canada in 2004, where it was championed by trade-union activist and professor Gérald Larose.

==Awards and recognition==
On June 30, 2016, Godbout was made an Officer of the Order of Canada by Governor General David Johnston for &quot;his significant contributions to the literary arts and critical thinking for more than half a century.&quot;

His other awards and recognition include:

* Chevalier of the National Order of Quebec
* Ludger-Duvernay Prize (1973)
* Awarded the 2007 Prix Maurice Genevoix for &quot;La concierge du Panthéon&quot;
* Nominated for a 1997 Governor General&#x27;s Award for children&#x27;s literature for &quot;Une leçon de chasse&quot;
* Winner of the Quebec government&#x27;s Prix Athanase-David in 1985
* Prix Belgique-Canada (1978)
* Winner of the 1967 Governor General&#x27;s Award for Fiction for &quot;Salut Galarneau&quot;

In 1973 Joseph Pivato published &quot;Nouveau Roman Canadien&quot; in &quot;Canadian Literature&quot; No. 58, the first English language analysis of &quot;Le couteau sur la table&quot; which he claims changed his whole career as a writer who has published fourteen books by 2023.

<text>Durrës ( , ; ) is the second-most-populous city of the Republic of Albania and seat of Durrës County and Durrës Municipality. It is one of Albania&#x27;s oldest continuously inhabited cities, with roughly 2,500 years of recorded history. It is located on a flat plain along the Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast between the mouths of the Erzen and Ishëm at the southeastern corner of the Adriatic Sea. Durrës&#x27; climate is profoundly influenced by a seasonal Mediterranean climate.

Durrës was founded under the name of Epidamnos around the 7th century BC, by ancient Greek colonists from Corinth and Corcyra in cooperation with the Taulantii, a local Illyrian tribe. Also known as Dyrrachium, Durrës essentially developed as it became an integral part of the Roman Empire and its successor the Byzantine Empire. The Via Egnatia started in the city and led east across the fields, lowlands and highlands of the Balkan Peninsula to Constantinople.

In the Middle Ages, Durrës was contested between Bulgarians, Venetians, local Albanian noble families and Ottoman dominion. The Ottomans ultimately prevailed, ruling the city for more than 400 years from 1501 until 1912. Following the Albanian Declaration of Independence, the city served as the capital of the Principality of Albania for a short period of time. Subsequently, it was annexed by the Kingdom of Italy in the interwar period and was occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II. Durrës experienced a strong expansion in its demography and economic activity under the People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania.

The transport connections, concentration of economic institutions and industrial tradition underlie Durrës&#x27; leading economic position in Albania. It is served by the Port of Durrës, one of the largest on the Adriatic Sea, which connects the city to other neighbouring countries. Its most considerable attraction is the Amphitheatre of Durrës that is included on the Albanian tentative list for designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Once having a capacity for 20,000 people, it is the largest amphitheatre in the Balkan Peninsula.

== Name ==

In antiquity, the city was known as () and () in classical Greek and then and in classical Latin. &quot;Epidamnos&quot; is the older known of the two toponyms; it is widely considered to be of Illyrian origin, as first proposed by linguist Hans Krahe, and is attested in Thucydides (5th century BC), Aristotle (4th century BC), and Polybius (2nd century BC). Etymologically, &quot;Epidamnos&quot; may be related to Proto-Albanian *dami (cub, young animal, young bull) &gt; dem (modern Albanian) as proposed by linguist Eqrem Çabej. Although the name &quot;Epidamnos/Epidamnus&quot; was more commonly used among Ancient Greek authors, the coinage of the city only used the abbreviations for the name &quot;Dyrrhachion/Dyrrhachium&quot;. &quot;Dyrrachium&quot; was chosen as the sole name of the city after the Roman Republic got control of the region after the Illyrian Wars in 229 BC. The Latin spelling of /y/ retained the form of Doric Greek Dyrrhachion, which was pronounced as /Durrakhion/. This change of the name is already attested in classical literature. Titus Livius, at the end of the first century BC, writes in Ab Urbe Condita Libri that at the time of the Illyrian Wars (roughly 200 years earlier) the city was not known as Dyrrachium, but as Epidamnus. Pomponius Mela, about 70 years later than Titus Livius, attributed the change of the name to the fact that the name Epidamnos reminded the Romans of the Latin word , which signified evil and bad luck; Pliny the Elder, who lived in the same period, repeated this explanation in his own works. However, the Romans may have adopted the new name because it was already in more frequent use by citizens of the city.

The name &quot;Dyrrhachion&quot; is usually explained as a Greek compound from &#x27;bad&#x27; and &#x27;rocky shore, flood, roaring waves&#x27;, an explanation already hinted at in antiquity by Cassius Dio, who writes it referred to the difficulties of the rocky coastline, while also reporting that other Roman authors linked it to the name of an eponymous hero &quot;Dyrrachius&quot;. The mythological construction of the city&#x27;s name was recorded by Appian (2nd century AD) who wrote that &quot;the king of the barbarians of this country, Epidamnus gave the name to the city. His daughter&#x27;s son Dyrrachius, built a port near the town that he called Dyrrachium&quot;. Stephanus of Byzantium repeated this mythological construction in his work. It is unclear whether the two toponyms referred originally to different areas of the territory of the city or whether they referred to the same territory. Classical literature indicates that they more probably referred to different neighbouring areas originally. Gradually, the name Epidamnus fell out of use and Dyrrachium became the sole name for the city.
Archaeological research has shown that at the time of the foundation of Durrës, two distinct settlements existed on its territory. The first one is a hill site with no direct contact with the sea. It predates the colony and might represent the settlement which held the toponym known as &quot;Epidamnos&quot; in ancient literature. The hill site overlooks to its south the second site which is the territory of the port of Durrës, where the colony was founded. Its location on a rocky shore struck by waves on all sides reflects the description of the toponym Dyrrhachion. The distinction between these two districts of the city remained in place even much later. In the 19th century, &quot;Durrës proper&quot; was the district of the port, while the hill north of it was a separate settlement, Stani (Kodra e Stanit).

The modern names of the city in Albanian () and Italian (, ) are derived from &quot;Dyrrachium&quot;/&quot;Dyrrachion&quot;. An intermediate, palatalized antecedent is found in the form &quot;Dyrratio&quot;, attested in the early centuries AD. The palatalized /-tio/ ending probably represents a phonetic change in the way the inhabitants of the city pronounced its name. The preservation of old Doric /u/ indicates that the modern name derives from populations to whom the toponym was known in its original Doric pronunciation. By contrast, in Byzantine Greek, the name of the city is pronounced with the much later evolution of /u/ as /i/. The modern Italian name evolved in the sub-dialects that emerged from Colloquial Latin in northern Italy. The modern Albanian name evolved independently from the parent language of Albanian around the same period of the post-Roman era in the first centuries AD as the difference in stress in the two toponyms (first syllable in Albanian, second in Italian) highlights. In Aromanian, the city is known as . During the 411-year Ottoman period, Durrës was known in Ottoman Turkish as &quot;Dırac&quot; (دراج); with final consonant devoicing, the name has evolved into modern Turkish as &quot;Dıraç&quot;. In Venetian it is called &quot;Durazo&quot;, while in the South Slavic languages the city is known as &quot;Drač&quot; (Cyrillic Драч).

In English usage, the Italian form &quot;Durazzo&quot; used to be widespread, but the local Albanian name &quot;Durrës&quot; has gradually replaced it in recent decades.

== History ==

=== Earliest period ===

The territory of Durrës was populated at least starting from the Eneolithic and then, from protohistoric times, it was inhabited by Illyrian peoples.

=== Antiquity ===

Though surviving remains are minimal, Durrës is one of the oldest cities in Albania. In terms of mythology, the genealogy of the foundation of Dyrrhachium includes among the founders Illyrian men (the Illyrian king Epidamnos and his grandson Dyrrachos), Greek men (the Corinthian Falio, descendant of Heracles), heroes (Heracles who was given part of the lands) and gods (Poseidon, as father of Dyrrachos).

Several ancient people held the site: the presence of the Brygi appears to be confirmed by several ancient writers, the Illyrian Taulantii (their arrival has been estimated to have happened not later than the 10th century BC), probably the Liburni who expanded southwards in the 9th century BC. The city was founded by Greek colonists in 627 BC on the coast of the Taulantii. According to ancient authors, the Greek colonists helped the Taulantii to expel Liburnians and mixed with the local population establishing the Greek element to the port. A flourishing commercial centre emerged and the city grew rapidly. The fact that about the 6th century BC the citizens of Epidamnus constructed a Doric-style treasury at Olympia confirms that the city was among the richest of the Ancient Greek world. An ancient account describes Epidamnos as &#x27;a great power and very populated&#x27; city.

After 323 BC Epidamnus-Dyrrhachium was involved in the intervention in Illyria of the Macedonians under Cassander, who clashed with the Illyrians under Glaukias. In 314 BC the Macedonian king seized the city but the garrison he established there was in turn besieged and driven out by the Illyrian king and the Corcyrans. In 312 BC, after another unsuccessful attack of Cassander in the region, the city came under the protection of Glaukias. Those events marked the end of Macedonian presence on the Adriatic coast for almost one century. The city probably came under the control of Pyrrhus of Epirus at the beginning of the 3rd century BC. From about 280 BC the Illyrian king Monunius, and his successor Mytilos minted in Dyrrhachion silver and bronze coins respectively, bearing the king&#x27;s name and the symbol of the city. The fact that their coins were struck in the city mint of Dyrrhachion stresses that they exercised to some extent their authority over the city.

Epidamnus came under the control of the Illyrian Ardiaei under Agron, who fortified the city (–231 BC). When the Romans defeated the Illyrians, they replaced the rule of queen Teuta with that of Demetrius of Pharos, one of her generals. He lost his kingdom, including Epidamnus, to the Romans in 219 BC at the Second Illyrian War. In the Third Illyrian War Epidamnus was attacked by Gentius but he was defeated by the Romans at the same year.

For Catullus, the city was &quot;Durrachium Hadriae tabernam&quot;, &quot;the &quot;taberna&quot; of the Adriatic&quot;, one of the stopping places for a Roman traveling up the Adriatic, as Catullus had done himself in the sailing season of 56.

After the Illyrian Wars with the Roman Republic in 229 BC ended in a decisive defeat for the Illyrians, the city passed to Roman rule, under which it was developed as a major military and naval base. The Romans preferred to use the name &quot;Dyrrachium&quot; (Greek: Δυρράχιον / &quot;Dyrrhachion&quot;) for the city. They considered the name &quot;Epidamnos&quot; to be inauspicious because of its wholly coincidental similarities with the Latin word &quot;damnum&quot;, meaning &quot;loss&quot; or &quot;harm&quot;. The meaning of &quot;Dyrrachium&quot; (&quot;bad spine&quot; or &quot;difficult ridge&quot; in Greek) is unclear, but it has been suggested that it refers to the imposing cliffs near the city. During the Great Roman Civil War in Illyria, the Battle of Dyrrachium was undertaken by Julius Caesar against Gnaeus Pompey. The battle was a victory for Pompey, but it preceded the more decisive Battle of Pharsalus in Greece where Caesar won. Under Roman rule, Dyrrachium prospered; it became the western end of the &quot;Via Egnatia&quot;, the great Roman road that led to Thessalonica and on to Constantinople. Another lesser road led south to the city of &quot;Buthrotum&quot;, the modern Butrint. The Roman emperor Caesar Augustus made the city a colony for veterans of his legions following the Battle of Actium, proclaiming it a &quot;civitas libera&quot; (free town).

In the 4th century, Dyrrachium was made the capital of the Roman province of Epirus nova. It was the birthplace of the emperor Anastasius I in . Sometime later that century, Dyrrachium was struck by a powerful earthquake which destroyed the city&#x27;s defences. Anastasius I rebuilt and strengthened the city walls, thus creating the strongest fortifications in the western Balkans. The walls were so thick that, according to the Byzantine historian Anna Komnene, four horsemen could ride abreast on them. Significant portions of the ancient city defences still remain, although they have been much reduced over the centuries.

Like much of the rest of the Balkans, Dyrrachium and the surrounding &quot;Dyrraciensis provinciae&quot; suffered considerably from barbarian incursions during the Migrations Period. It was besieged in 481 by Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths, and in subsequent centuries had to fend off frequent attacks by the Bulgarians. Unaffected by the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the city continued under the Byzantine Empire as an important port and a major link between the Empire and western Europe. During the sixth century based on accounts of Procopius, the city was mainly inhabited by a Greek population.

=== Middle Ages ===
The city and the surrounding coast became a Byzantine province, the Theme of Dyrrhachium, probably in the first decade of the 9th century. Durrës became a Christian city quite early on; its bishopric was created around 58 and was raised to the status of an archbishopric in 449. It was also the seat of an Orthodox metropolitan bishop. The city remained in Byzantine hands until the late 10th century, when control passed to Samuel of Bulgaria, possibly through his marriage with Agatha, daughter of the local magnate John Chryselios. Samuel made his son-in-law Ashot Taronites, a Byzantine captive who had married his daughter Miroslava, governor of Durrës. In circa 1005, however, Ashot and Miroslava, with the connivance of Chryselios, fled to Constantinople, where they notified Emperor Basil II of their intention to surrender the city to him. Soon a Byzantine squadron under Eustathios Daphnomeles arrived at Durrës, and the city returned to Byzantine rule.
In the 11th–12th centuries, the city was important as a military stronghold and a metropolitan see rather than as a major economic center, and never recovered its late antique prosperity; Anna Komnene makes clear that medieval Dyrrhachium occupied only a portion of the ancient city. In the 1070s, two of its governors, Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder and Nikephoros Basilakes, led unsuccessful rebellions trying to seize the Byzantine throne. Dyrrachium was lost in February 1082 when Alexios I Komnenos was defeated by the Normans under Robert Guiscard and his son Bohemund in the Battle of Dyrrhachium. Byzantine control was restored a few years later, but the Normans under Bohemund returned to besiege it in 1107–08, and sacked it again in 1185 under King William II of Sicily.

In 1205, after the Fourth Crusade, the city was transferred to the rule of the Republic of Venice, which formed the &quot;Duchy of Durazzo&quot;. This Duchy was conquered in 1213 and the city taken by the Despotate of Epirus under Michael I Komnenos Doukas. In 1257, Durrës was briefly occupied by the King of Sicily, Manfred of Hohenstaufen. It was re-occupied by the Despot of Epirus Michael II Komnenos Doukas until 1259, when the Despotate was defeated by the Byzantine Empire of Nicaea in the Battle of Pelagonia. In the 1270s, Durrës was again controlled by Epirus under Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas, the son of Michael II, who in 1278 was forced to yield the city to Charles d&#x27; Anjou (Charles I of Sicily). In , it was wrecked by a devastating earthquake (according to George Pachymeres) but soon recovered. It was briefly occupied by King Milutin of Serbia in 1296. In the thirteenth century, a Jewish community existed in Durrës and was employed in the salt trade.

In the early 14th century, the city was ruled by a coalition of Anjous, Hungarians, and Albanians of the Thopia family. In 1317 or 1318, the area was taken by the Serbs and remained under their rule until the 1350s. At that time the Popes, supported by the Anjous, increased their diplomatic and political activity in the area, by using the Latin bishops, including the archbishop of Durrës. The city had been a religious center of Catholicism after the Anjou were installed in Durrës. In 1272, a Catholic archbishop was installed, and until the mid-14th century there were both Catholic and Orthodox archbishops of Durrës.

Two Irish pilgrims who visited Albania on their way to Jerusalem in 1322, reported that Durrës was &quot;inhabited by Latins, Greeks, perfidious Jews and barbaric Albanians&quot;.

When the Serbian Tsar Dušan died in 1355, the city passed into the hands of the Albanian family of Thopias. In 1376 the Navarrese Company Louis of Évreux, Duke of Durazzo, who had gained the rights on the Kingdom of Albania from his second wife, attacked and conquered the city, but in 1383 Karl Topia regained control of the city. The Republic of Venice regained control in 1392 from Gjergj Thopia and retained the city, known as &quot;Durazzo&quot; in those years, as part of the &quot;Albania Veneta&quot;. It fended off a siege by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II in 1466 but fell to Ottoman forces in 1501.
=== Ottoman period (to 1912) ===
Under Ottoman rule, many of its inhabitants converted to Islam and many mosques were erected. The city was renamed Dırac (دراج) but did not prosper in the first two centuries of the Ottoman era; its importance declined greatly and it became a den of piracy. Following the establishment of Ottoman rule in 1501, the Durrës Jewish community experienced population growth.


As a port, Durrës was of little importance to the Ottomans, who controlled the entire Albanian coast. The town&#x27;s main significance rather lay in its strategic castle, which the Turks reinforced and improved upon, and its rich salt deposits. There were few permanent civilian settlements, and most of the population, including the local kadı, opted to live further inland, such as in the newly established town of Kavajë, 14 km south of Durrës. The Ottoman chronicler Evliya Çelebi visited Durrës in 1670-71 and noted in his &quot;Seyahatname&quot; that there were around 150 houses as well as a mosque named after Sultan Bayezid II.

The city&#x27;s economy began to recover from the late 17th century onwards, boosted by profits from the salt mines, which exported salt throughout the Balkan hinterland. According to diplomat and Turkologist François Pouqueville, about 100 Turkish and Greek merchants lived in the city in 1699, exporting 3,000 quintals (300 tons) of beeswax, 15,000 quintals (1,500 tons) of finished cloth, 15,000 pieces of fine leather, and 60-100 ships of wheat, barley, corn and millet to Venice every year despite an official prohibition from the central government in Constantinople. France, England, the Netherlands, and Austria established their consulates in Durrës in 1700.

As Ottoman relations with Venice improved upon the conclusion of the Ottoman-Venetian Wars, Durrës became a focal point of trade with the Republic of Venice, especially in grains and olive oil, as reported by the Venetian consul in the city in 1769. Mercantile relations with Venice were halted when the latter city was occupied by Napoleonic forces in 1797, bringing an end to the maritime republic. The Austrian Empire and later Austria-Hungary, via the port of Trieste, then replaced Venice as Durrës&#x27; largest trading partner. According to contemporary statistician Friedrich Wilhelm von Reden, total exports from Durrës reached 672,000 Austrian thalers each year, while imports amounted to 455,000 thalers.

By the mid-19th century, its population was said to have been about 1,000 people living in some 200 households. In the late nineteenth century, Durrës contained 1,200 Orthodox Aromanians (130 families) who lived among the larger population of Muslim Albanians alongside a significant number of Catholic Albanians. The decrepitude of Durrës was noted by foreign observers in the early 20th century, echoing comments made by the Ottoman cartographer Piri Reis almost 400 years before: &quot;The walls are dilapidated; plane-trees grow on the gigantic ruins of its old Byzantine citadel; and its harbour, once equally commodious and safe, is gradually becoming silted up.&quot;

During the Tanzimat (reform) era, Durrës was separated from the Sanjak of Elbasan and became a main administrative centre in the reorganised İşkodra Vilayet before 1912; it had its own sanjak, namely the Sanjak of Durrës, which was established in 1880 within the vilayet. With the city&#x27;s economic prosperity and upgrade in status, its demographic decline was also reversed. Many government buildings were built, as well as Western-style hotels and restaurants for private businesses. In 1892-1893 the population of the kaza of Durrës grew to about 4,781, consisting of 3,018 Muslims, 1,514 Orthodox, 201 Catholics, and 48 foreigners.

On 26 November 1912, as the Ottoman Empire was embroiled in the First Balkan War, a group of nationalists led by Ismail Qemali raised the Albanian flag over Durrës. Albania declared independence two days later, bringing four centuries of Turkish rule in Durrës to an end.

=== Modern ===

Durrës was an active city in the Albanian national liberation movement in the periods 1878–1881 and 1910–1912. Ismail Qemali raised the Albanian flag on 26 November 1912 but the city was occupied by the Kingdom of Serbia three days later during the First Balkan War. On 29 November 1912 Durrës became the county town of the Durrës County one of the counties of the Kingdom of Serbia established on the part of the territory of Albania occupied from Ottoman Empire. The Durrës County had four districts: Durrës, Lezha, Elbasan and Tirana. The army of the Kingdom of Serbia retreated from Durrës in April 1913. The city became Albania&#x27;s second national capital (after Vlorë) on 7 March 1914 under the brief rule of Prince Wilhelm, Prince of Albania. It remained Albania&#x27;s capital until 11 February 1920, when the Congress of Lushnjë made Tirana the new capital.

During the First World War, the city was occupied by Italy in 1915 and by Austria-Hungary in 1916–1918. On 29 December 1915, a Naval Battle was fought off Durazzo. On 2 October 1918, several allied ships bombarded Durazzo and attacked the few Austrian ships in the harbour. Although civilians started to flee the city at the start of the bombardment, many casualties were inflicted on the innocent and neutral population. The Old City being adjacent to the harbour was largely destroyed, including the Royal Palace of Durrës and other primary public buildings. It was captured by Italian troops on 16 October 1918. Restored to Albanian sovereignty, Durrës became the country&#x27;s temporary capital between 1918 and March 1920. It experienced an economic boom due to Italian investments and developed into a major seaport under the rule of King Zog, with a modern harbour being constructed in 1927. It was at this time the Royal Villa of Durrës was built by Zog as a summer palace, that still dominates the skyline from a hill close to the old city.

An earthquake in 1926 damaged some of the city and the rebuilding that followed gave the city its more modern appearance. During the 1930s, the Bank of Athens had a branch in the city. 

Durrës (called &quot;Durazzo&quot; again in Italian) and the rest of Albania were occupied in April 1939 and annexed to the Kingdom of Italy until 1943, then occupied by Nazi Germany until autumn 1944. Durrës&#x27;s strategic value as a seaport made it a high-profile military target for both sides. It was the site of the initial Italian landings on 7 April 1939 (and was fiercely defended by Mujo Ulqinaku) as well as the launch point for the ill-fated Italian invasion of Greece. The city was heavily damaged by Allied bombing during the war and the port installations were blown up by retreating German soldiers in autumn 1944.


The Communist regime of Enver Hoxha rapidly rebuilt the city following the war, establishing a variety of heavy industries in the area and expanding the port. It became the terminus of Albania&#x27;s first railway, begun in 1947 (Durrës–Tirana railway). In the late 1980s, the city was briefly renamed Durrës-Enver Hoxha. The city was and continues to remain the center of Albanian mass beach tourism.

Following the collapse of communist rule in 1990, Durrës became the focus of mass emigrations from Albania with ships being hijacked in the harbour and sailed at gunpoint to Italy. In one month alone, August 1991, over 20,000 people migrated to Italy in this fashion. Italy intervened militarily, putting the port area under its control, and the city became the center of the European Community&#x27;s &quot;Operation Pelican&quot;, a food-aid program.

In 1997, Albania slid into anarchy following the collapse of a massive pyramid scheme which devastated the national economy. An Italian-led peacekeeping force was controversially deployed to Durrës and other Albanian cities to restore order, although there were widespread suggestions that the real purpose of &quot;Operation Alba&quot; was to prevent economic refugees continuing to use Albania&#x27;s ports as a route to migrate to Italy.

Following the start of the 21st century, Durrës has been revitalized as many streets were repaved, while parks and façades experienced a face lift.

=== Transportation ===

Major roads and railways pass through the city of Durrës thank to its significant location and connect the northern part of the country to the south and the west with the east. Durrës is the starting point of Pan-European Corridor VIII, national roads SH2 and SH4, and serves as the main railway station of the Albanian Railways (HSH).

The Pan-European Corridor VIII is one of the Pan-European corridors. It runs between Durrës, at the Adriatic coast, and Varna, at the Bulgarian Black Sea coast. The National Road 2 (SH2) begins at the Port of Durrës at the Dajlani Overpass, bypasses the road to Tirana International Airport, and ends at the Kamza Overpass in the outskirts of Tirana where it meets National Road 1 (SH1) State Road heading to northern Albania. The Albania–Kosovo Highway is a four-lane highway constructed from 2006 to 2013 between Albania and Kosovo. As part of the South-East European Route 7, the highway will connect the Adriatic Sea ports of Durrës via Pristina, with the E75/Corridor X near Niš, Serbia. As most tourists come through Kosovo, the laying of the highway make it easier to travel to Durrës.

The Port of Durrës, in the south-west of the city, is one of the major ports of the Adriatic Sea and plays a very important role in the city&#x27;s economy. The port is located on an artificial basin that is formed between two moles, with a west-northwesterly oriented entrance approximately wide as it passes between the ends of the moles. The port is also a key location for transit networks and passenger ferry, giving Durrës a strategic position with respect to the Pan-European Corridor VIII. The port has experienced major upgrades in recent years culminating with the opening of the new terminal in July 2012.
In 2012, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; ranked Durrës at no. 1 among 8 exciting new cruise ports to explore. It is one of the largest passenger port on the Adriatic Sea that handle more than 1.5 million passengers per year.

The railway station of Durrës is connected to other cities in Albania, including the capital of Tirana, Vlorë, Elbasan and Shkodër. The Durrës–Tirana railway was a railway line which joined the two biggest cities in Albania: Durrës and Tirana. The line connects to the Shkodër–Vorë railway halfway in Vorë, and to the Durrës–Vlorë railway in Durrës. In 2015, some rail stations and rolling stock along the Durrës-Tirana line are being upgraded and latter colored red and white.

A rail connection between Durrës and Pristina in Kosovo was proposed in 2021, with a feasibility study being prepared in 2022.

== Demography ==

Durrës is the second most populous municipality in Albania and one of the most populous on the Adriatic Sea with a growing number of inhabitants. According to the 2011 census, the municipal unit of Durrës had an estimated population of 113,249 of whom 56,511 were men and 56,738 women.

Islam was introduced to the city in the early 16th century during the Ottoman conquest. Much of the local population converted to Islam during the four centuries of Ottoman rule. The two most well-known mosques in the city are the Great Mosque of Durrës (built in 1931 on the site of an earlier Ottoman mosque) and the Fatih Mosque, erected in 1502 just one year after the city became part of the Ottoman Empire.

Christianity in Durrës and elsewhere in Albania has a presence dating back to classical antiquity. Christian traditions relate that the archbishopric of Durrës was founded by the apostle Paul while he was preaching in Illyria and Epirus and that there were possibly about seventy Christian families in the city as early as the time of the apostles. The Orthodox Church of Albania, which has been autocephalous since 1923, was divided into the archbishopric of Tirana–Durrës, headed by the Metropolitan and sub-divided into the local church districts of Tirana, Durrës, Shkodër and Elbasan.

== Culture ==
The theatrical and musical life of the city is centered on the Aleksandër Moisiu Theatre, the Estrada Theatre, a puppet theatre, and the Philharmonic Orchestra. The annual International Film Summerfest of Durrës, founded in 2008, is held in late August or early September in the amphitheatre. In 2004 and 2009 Miss Globe International was held in Durrës.

The city is home to different architectural styles that represent influential periods in its history. The architecture is influenced by Illyrian, Greek, Roman and Italian architecture. In the 21st century, part of Durrës turned into a modernist city, with large blocks of flats, modern new buildings, new shopping centres and many green spaces.

=== Education ===
Durrës has a long tradition of education since the beginning of civil life from antiquity until today. After the fall of communism in Albania, a reorganization plan was announced in 1990, that would extend the compulsory education program from eight to ten years. The following year, major economic and political crisis in Albania, and the ensuing breakdown of public order, plunged the school system into chaos. Later, many schools were rebuilt or reconstructed, to improve learning conditions especially in larger cities of the country. Durrës is host to academic institutions such as the University of Durrës, Albanian College of Durrës, Kajtazi Brothers Educational Institute, Gjergj Kastrioti High School, Naim Frashëri High School, sports mastery school Benardina Qerraxhiu and Jani Kukuzeli Artistic Lycee.

One of the city&#x27;s main sights is the Byzantine city wall, also called Durrës Castle, while the largest amphitheatre in the Balkans is close to the city&#x27;s harbour. This fifth-century construction is currently under consideration for listing as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

=== Museums ===

Durrës is home to the largest archaeological museum in the country, the Durrës Archaeological Museum, located near the beach. North of the museum are the sixth-century Byzantine walls constructed after the Visigoth invasion of 481. The bulk of the museum&#x27;s collection comprises artefacts from the nearby ancient site of Dyrrhachium and includes an extensive collection from the Illyrian, Ancient Greek, Hellenistic and Roman periods. Items of major note include Roman funeral steles and stone sarcophagi, a colourful elliptical mosaic measuring , known as &quot;The Beauty of Durrës&quot;, and a collection of miniature busts of Venus, testament to the time when Durrës was a centre of worship of the goddess. There are several other museums including the Royal Villa of Durrës and the Museum of History (in the house of the actor Aleksandër Moisiu).

<text>James Beattie (; 25 October 1735 – 18 August 1803) was a Scottish poet, moralist, and philosopher.

==Career==
He became schoolmaster of the parish of Fordoun in 1753. He took the position of usher at the grammar-school of Aberdeen in 1758.

In 1760, he was, to his surprise, appointed Professor of Moral Philosophy at Marischal College (later part of Aberdeen University) as a result of the influence exerted by his close friend, Robert Arbuthnot of Haddo. In the following year he published a volume of poems, &quot;The Judgment of Paris&quot; (1765), which attracted attention. But the two works that brought him most fame were &quot;An Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth&quot;, and his poem of &quot;The Minstrel&quot;. The &quot;Essay&quot;, intended as an answer to David Hume, had great immediate success, and led to an introduction to the King, a pension of £200, and the degree of LL.D. from Oxford. The first book of &quot;The Minstrel&quot; was published in 1771 and the second in 1774, and constitutes his true title to remembrance, winning him the praise of Samuel Johnson. It contains much beautiful descriptive writing.

Beattie was prominent in arguing against the institution of slavery, notably in his &quot;Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth&quot; (1770), and in &quot;Elements of Moral Science&quot; (1790–93), where he used the case of Dido Belle to argue the mental capacity of black people.

Beattie was an amateur cellist and member of the Aberdeen Musical Society. He considered questions of music philosophy in his essay &quot;On Poetry and Music&quot; (written 1762, published 1776), which was republished several times and translated into French in 1798. His poem &quot;The Hermit&quot; was set to music by Tommaso Giordani (1778).

Beattie co-founded the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1786.

==Personal life==
James Beattie was born the youngest of six children of a shopkeeper and small farmer at Laurencekirk in the Mearns, and educated at Marischal, graduating in 1753.

Beattie underwent much domestic sorrow in his later years, which broke down his own health and spirits. His wife, Mary &quot;née&quot; Dunn, whom he had married in 1767, went mad and was committed to a Musselburgh asylum. His two promising sons both died: James Hay in 1790 aged 22 from &quot;nervous atrophy&quot;, and Montagu in 1796, a &#x27;promising poet&#x27; aged 18 after a short illness.

He relinquished his duties at Marischal in 1797. That year he became afflicted with rheumatism, and in 1799 he had a stroke of palsy. He died in Aberdeen in 1803 and is buried there in St Nicholas&#x27; Churchyard.

His niece, Margaret Valentine, married Reverend Professor George Glennie FRSE.

==Recognition==

Beattie is today remembered primarily for his poetry and for his staunch opposition to slavery. His philosophical work, at least in such areas as epistemology and metaphysics, has generally been assessed very negatively in the time since his death. Immanuel Kant regarded him in that way, stating that his misunderstanding of most of David Hume&#x27;s work was &quot;positively painful&quot;. Philosopher John Immerwahr states that among contemporary scholars, Beattie is regarded as &quot;a superficial thinker who is primarily known because he was the source for some of Kant&#x27;s knowledge of Hume&quot;.

A biographical sketch, &quot;An Account of the Life of James Beattie, LL.D.&quot;, was published in 1804 by Alexander Bower.

The poet Robert Burns informed Mrs Frances Dunlop in a letter that the idea of using Coila as the name of his poetic muse first came to him from Beattie&#x27;s use of a muse named &#x27;Scota&#x27; in his Scots language poem of 1768 titled &quot;To Mr Alexander at Lochlee.&quot;

Beattie is one of the sixteen Scottish poets and writers depicted on the Scott Monument on Princes Street in Edinburgh. He appears on the left side of the east face.

<text>The British Academy for the Promotion of Historical, Philosophical and Philological Studies is the United Kingdom&#x27;s national academy for the humanities and the social sciences.
It was established in 1902 and received its royal charter in the same year. It is now a fellowship of more than 1,000 leading scholars spanning all disciplines across the humanities and social sciences and a funding body for research projects across the United Kingdom. The academy is a self-governing and independent registered charity, based at 10–11 Carlton House Terrace in London.

The British Academy is primarily funded with annual government grants. In 2022, £49.3m of its £51.7m of charitable income came from the Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy – in the same year it took in around £2.0m in trading income and £0.56m in other income. This funding is expected to continue under the new Department for Business and Trade.

==Purposes==

The academy states that it has five fundamental purposes:
* To speak up for the humanities and the social sciences
* To invest in the very best researchers and research
* To inform and enrich debate around society&#x27;s greatest questions
* To ensure sustained international engagement and collaboration
* To make the most of the Academy&#x27;s assets to secure the Academy for the future.

==History==
The creation of a &quot;British Academy for the Promotion of Historical, Philosophical and Philological Studies&quot; was first proposed in 1899 in order that Britain could be represented at meetings of European and American academies. The organisation, which has since become simply &quot;the British Academy&quot;, was initiated as an unincorporated society on 17 December 1901, and received its Royal Charter from King Edward VII on 8 August 1902.

Since then, many of Britain&#x27;s most distinguished scholars in the humanities and social sciences have been involved in the life of the academy, including John Maynard Keynes, Isaiah Berlin, C. S. Lewis and Henry Moore.

Until 1927–28 the academy had no premises. Then it moved to some rooms in No. 6 Burlington Gardens. In 1968 it moved the short distance to Burlington House. It subsequently moved to headquarters near Regent&#x27;s Park. Then in 1998 the Academy moved to its present headquarters in Carlton House Terrace. Overlooking St James&#x27;s Park, the terrace was designed by John Nash and built in the 1820s and 1830s. Number 10 was formerly the London residence of the Ridley family and number 11 was from 1856 to 1875 the home of Prime Minister William Gladstone.

In March 2010, the academy embarked on a £2.75m project to renovate and restore the public rooms in No. 11, following the departure of former tenant the Foreign Press Association, and link the two buildings together. The work was completed in January 2011 and the new spaces include a new 150-seat Wolfson Auditorium are available for public hire. In addition to offices for its staff 10 - 11 Carlton House Terrace is used for academy conferences and events and parts of the building are available on a private hire basis for events.

The history, problems and achievements of the academy have been recorded in works by two of its secretaries. Sir Frederic Kenyon&#x27;s volume of 37 pages covers the years up to 1951; Sir Mortimer Wheeler&#x27;s volume covers the years 1949 to 1968.

==Fellowship==

==Funding schemes==

The British Academy channels substantial public funding into support for individuals and organisations pursuing humanities and social sciences research and scholarship in the UK and overseas. These funding schemes are designed to aid scholars at different stages of their academic career and include postdoctoral fellowships, Wolfson Research Professorships, Leverhulme Senior Research Fellowships, small research grants and British Academy Research Projects.

In addition to its main public funds supported by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the academy also draws on private funds arising from gifts, legacies, contributions made by fellows and grants from research foundations to support a further range of research activities. In 2014/15, the academy received around £30m to support research and researchers across the humanities and social sciences. Funds available to the academy were invested in the following main areas: research career development; a portfolio of research grant opportunities, and international engagement. The demand and quality of applications submitted for academy funding remains high. This year the academy received around 3,600 applications and made 588 awards to scholars based in around 100 different universities across the UK – a success rate of 16 per cent.

==International work==
In order to promote the interests of UK research and learning around the world, the Academy works to create frameworks to support international networking and collaboration and develop the role of humanities and social sciences research in tackling global challenges. It draws on expertise from a wide range of sources from within the fellowship and on specialist advice from its seven Area Panels for Africa, China, the Middle East, Europe, South Asia, and Latin America/Caribbean.

The Academy also funds and coordinates a network of overseas institutes which provide local expertise, logistical support and often a working base for UK scholars. These include research institutes in Amman, Ankara, Athens, Jerusalem, Nairobi, Rome and Tehran, as well as UK-based specialist learned societies which run strategic research programmes in other parts of the world including Africa, Latin America and South and South East Asia.

==Higher education and research==
As the UK&#x27;s national voice for the humanities and social sciences, the British Academy seeks to promote and protect the interests and health of these disciplines and their research base. It makes independent representations to the government and other bodies on relevant higher education and research issues, contributes statements and submissions to formal consultations and organises a range of policy events and discussions, liaising regularly with learned societies, universities, national academies and other relevant organisations.

==Policy work==
The British Academy&#x27;s Fellowship represents breadth and excellence of expertise across these disciplines, and the Academy&#x27;s policy work is dedicated to applying that insight to policy issues for public benefit and societal well-being. The goal is to enlighten the context, meaning and practicalities of policy challenges. This work is meant to bring independence, authority and objectivity to complex issues, such as public policy, skills, education and research. From reports to small meetings, the British Academy provides a forum for examining issues that are important for the society and the economy.

==Public events==

The British Academy organises a wide-ranging annual programme of more than 50 public lectures, panel discussions, conferences and seminars showcasing new research and debating topical issues. This includes a number of long-established lecture series, such as the Shakespeare Lecture, first given in 1911. Most events are free and most take place at the Academy&#x27;s headquarters in Carlton House Terrace

<doc id="263550" wikidata="Q5254081" url="?curid=263550" title="Delivery month">
<text>For futures contracts specifying physical delivery, the delivery month is the month in which the seller must deliver, and the buyer must accept and pay for, the underlying. For contracts specifying cash settlement, the delivery month is the month of a final mark-to-market. The exact dates of acceptable delivery vary considerably and will be specified by the exchange in the futures contract specifications.

For most futures contracts, at any given time, one contract will typically be traded much more actively than others. This is called variously the &quot;front&quot; month or the &quot;top step&quot; contract.

Financial contracts traded on US futures exchanges (such as bonds, short-term interest rates, foreign exchange, and US stock indexes) typically expire quarterly, specifically in March, June, September, and December. However, for financial contracts traded on non-US futures exchanges, the expiration schedule may not follow a quarterly pattern.

==Codes==
This table lists the conventional letter codes used in tickers to specify delivery month:

To name a specific contract in a financial futures market, the month code will follow the contract code, and in turn be followed by the year. For example, CLZ3 is the December 2023 NYMEX crude oil contract. CL denotes crude oil (crude light), Z corresponds to the December delivery month, and 3 refers to 2023.

<text>Robert Bertelli, better known professionally as Bob Bert (born June 11, 1955), is an American rock drummer.

==Biography==
Based in Hoboken, New Jersey, Bert initially came to prominence as drummer for the experimental rock band Sonic Youth during the early to mid-1980s. Bert played on the Sonic Youth releases &quot;Confusion Is Sex&quot;, &quot;Sonic Death&quot;, and &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot;. After &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot;, Bert quit the group.

Bert contributed during the last half of the 1980s as percussionist for noise band Pussy Galore. He was a member of Action Swingers in the early 1990s.

In the early 1990s, Bert drummed for the Chrome Cranks (which also included Peter Aaron on vocals; Jerry Teel on bass; and William Weber on stun guitar).

After the dissolution of the Cranks, Bert joined forces with guitarist Kid Congo, guitarist Jack Martin, bassist/vocalist Jerry Teel and organist Barry London in the rootsy New York City band Knoxville Girls.

Throughout, Bert managed to release a handful of recordings by his percussive/concussive vehicle Bewitched. Releases by Bewitched include the &quot;Chocolate Frenzy&quot; 12&quot; EP; some albums, including &quot;Harshing My Mellow&quot; on No. 6 Records; and the &quot;Hey White Homie&quot; 7&quot; on Sub Pop. Bewitched toured with S.Y. and STP (short-lived NYC all-female foxcore band which included PG guitarist Julie Cafritz) during the summer of 1990, the year Goo was released.

During the late 1990s, Bert and his wife, artist Linda Wolfe, began publishing &quot;BBGun&quot;, a zine that primarily covers punk rock.

In 1998, Bert contributed the liner notes and interviewed Suicide for the reissue of the band&#x27;s eponymous second album.

Bert played with Five Dollar Priest as well as with the International Shades, which features ex-Live Skull guitarist Mark C. and former Pier Platters shop assistant-turned-keyboardist Dorien Garry among others.

In 2011 Thick Syrup Records released the compilation cd &quot;Bewitched - Bob Bert Presents: The Worst Poetry Of 1986 - 1993&quot;, featuring all tracks Bob Bert recorded with Bewitched. The label also released the last album of the re-united Chrome Cranks featuring Bert on drums.
Bert is now playing with Retrovirus (Lydia Lunch, Weasel Walter, Tim Dahl), who have released studio and live albums, and also with Wolfmanhattan Project with Kid Congo Powers (The Gun Club, The Cramps, Nick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds, Knoxville Girls, Pink Monkey Birds) and Mick Collins (The Gories, The Dirtbombs).

In 2019, Bert released &quot;I&#x27;m Just the Drummer: My Time Behind Sonic Youth, Pussy Galore, Chrome Cranks &amp; BB Gun Magazine&quot;, a book compiling his photographs and interviews he did with artists he collaborated with or that influenced him.

<doc id="263567" wikidata="Q344348" url="?curid=263567" title="İstiklal Avenue">
<text>İstiklal Avenue () is a 1.4 kilometre (0.87 mi) pedestrian street in the historic Beyoğlu (Pera) district in Istanbul, Turkey. It is one of the most famous avenues in the city. It acquired its modern name after the declaration of the Republic on 29 October 1923, &quot;İstiklal&quot; (Independence) commemorating Turkey&#x27;s triumph in its War of Independence.

The street starts at the northern end of Galata (the medieval Genoese quarter) at Tünel Square and runs as far as Taksim Square. It was historically known as the Grand Avenue of Pera (; ). İstiklal Avenue is flanked by late Ottoman era buildings (mostly from the 19th and early 20th centuries) in a variety of styles including Neo-Classical, Neo-Gothic, Renaissance Revival, Beaux-Arts, Art Nouveau and First Turkish National Architecture. There are also a few Art Deco style buildings from the early years of the Turkish Republic, and a number of more recent examples of modern architecture. Many would once have been apartment blocks but most are now occupied by boutiques, music stores, art galleries, cinemas, theatres, libraries, cafés, pubs, nightclubs with live music, hotels, historical patisseries, chocolateries, restaurants and a steadily growing number of international chain stores, as well as a branch of Madame Tussauds.

Galatasaray Square marks the middle of the avenue and is home to the oldest secondary school in Turkey: the Galatasaray High School (Galatasaray Lisesi), originally known as the &quot;Galata Sarayı Enderun-u Hümayunu&quot; (&quot;Galata Palace Imperial School&quot;). A monument, erected in 1973, commemorates the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Turkish Republic.

The avenue forms a spine with narrow side streets running off it like a ribcage. Many historical and politically significant buildings can be found on or immediately adjacent to Istiklal Avenue. They include the Çiçek Pasajı (&quot;Flower Passage&quot;) which is full of lively restaurants and taverns; the Balık Pazarı (&quot;The Fish Market&quot;) with the Armenian church of Üç Horan to one side; the Hüseyin Ağa Mosque; the Roman Catholic churches of Santa Maria Draperis and S. Antonio di Padova; the Greek Orthodox church of Hagia Triada; several academic institutions established by Austria, France, Germany and Italy in the 19th century; and the consulates (embassies until 1923 when these moved to the new capital of Ankara) of France, Greece, the Netherlands, Russia, Spain and Sweden (the consulate of the United Kingdom is just off Istiklal Avenue on Meşrutiyet Street).


At the southern end of the avenue, it is possible to board the Tünel (t&quot;he Tunnel&quot;), the world&#x27;s second-oldest subway, which entered service in 1875 and carries passengers down to Karaköy. A photogenic red-and-cream tram runs along the street from Tünel to Taksim Square every 15 minutes.

== History ==
During the Ottoman period, the avenue was called &quot;Cadde-i Kebir&quot; (Grand Avenue) in Ottoman Turkish, or the &quot;Grande Rue de Péra&quot; (Grand Avenue of Pera) in French. It was a popular gathering place where Ottoman intellectual rubbed shoulders with Europeans and the local Italian and French Levantines. When 19th-century travelers referred to Constantinople (today Istanbul) as the &quot;Paris of the East&quot;, they were usually thinking of the Grande Rue de Péra and its cosmopolitan, half-European, half-Asian culture.

On 6–7 September 1955 an anti-Greek Istanbul pogrom resulted in many shops along the avenue being pillaged; its pavements were covered with broken glass, scattered clothing, smashed white goods, burned automobiles and other items that had belonged to the Greek owners of the wrecked shops.

Between the 1950s and 1970s the side streets around the Emek Passage (&quot;Emek Pasajı&quot;) were home to Yeşilcam, Turkey&#x27;s home-grown equivalent of Hollywood, a fact commemorated in the street name Yeşilcam Sokağı.

The avenue briefly fell from grace in the 1970s and early 1980s, when the old Istanbulite inhabitants started moving elsewhere, and the side streets (then infamous for bars and night clubs with live music and shows, called &quot;pavyon&quot; in Turkish) were repopulated by low-income migrants from rural Anatolia.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, a revival took place, spearheaded and executed by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality and Beyoğlu Municipality. Historic buildings were restored, the street was pedestrianised, and the old historic trams were reinstated, bringing back much of the avenue&#x27;s old charm and popularity. 

İstiklal Avenue once again became the center for fine arts and leisure in Istanbul and real estate prices skyrocketed. Numerous new art galleries, bookstores, cafés, pubs, restaurants, shops and hotels were opened in and around the street, and venues around it became the host to many international art festivals, such as the annual Istanbul Film Festival.

Until the mid-2010s, İstiklal Avenue was also a popular venue for all sorts of parades, marches and gatherings, such as the Istanbul Pride and International Women&#x27;s Day. However, after the Gezi Park protests of 2013, all such gatherings have been effectively banned, citing security reasons.

On 19 March 2016, an Islamic State suicide bombing on Istiklal Avenue killed five people.

On 13 November 2022, a bomb explosion on Istiklal Avenue killed 6 people and left 81 injured. Police detained a Syrian woman, Ahlam Albashir, suspected of being a Kurdish insurgent having planted the bomb, in a sweep of 47 arrests.

<doc id="263570" wikidata="Q426445" url="?curid=263570" title="Fernão Lopes (soldier)">
<text>Fernão Lopes (died 1545) was the first known permanent inhabitant of the remote Island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean, an island that later became famous as the site of Napoleon&#x27;s exile and death.

Lopes was a 16th-century Portuguese soldier in India. He was tortured and disfigured in punishment for defecting to the side of Rasul Khan when the Portuguese conquered Goa in 1510. On his way home to Portugal after these events, Lopes chose voluntary exile on Saint Helena, where he lived in almost complete solitude for more than 30 years.

==In Portuguese service==

In 1510 Lopes, a minor nobleman and soldier, accompanied the Portuguese governor of India, Afonso de Albuquerque, on his conquest of Goa on the west coast of India. Shortly after its conquest, Albuquerque set sail to conquer Malacca in Malaysia, leaving Lopes behind as part of the garrison, with orders to keep the peace and rule over the local population. When Albuquerque returned nearly two years later, he found Goa under siege and some of the men had defected to the enemy side, and some, including Lopes himself, had married native women and converted to Islam.

Albuquerque&#x27;s men regained possession of the territory and Rasul Khan surrendered the Portuguese renegades on the condition that their lives be spared. Instead they were tortured so savagely that half of them died within three days. Lopes, as the leader of the group, received the harshest punishment. He was bound with ropes to two wooden posts, and Albuquerque&#x27;s men severed his nose, ears, right arm, and left thumb (according to others, his index and middle fingers as well) in a public square. His hair and beard were scraped off with clam shells. The survivors were then released, and fled to the jungle where they could hide their deformities and be left alone.

Lopes stayed in Goa until the death of Albuquerque in 1515, after which he set sail for Portugal, having been offered amnesty by King Manuel I. The ship stopped at Saint Helena for food and water. Saint Helena was discovered by the Portuguese João da Nova in 1502, and with its abundance of fresh water and fat tame birds, it became a regular port of call for Portuguese ships en route between the East Indies and Europe via the Cape of Good Hope. According to one source, Lopes went on land secretly and became utterly alone; according to another source he was landed with a boat and stayed on the island with a number of slaves. According to all sources, Lopes was granted a few supplies from the ship&#x27;s stores.

==Marooned on Saint Helena==

Nearly a year passed before another ship docked at Saint Helena. Lopes acclimated himself to his new home, a volcanic island almost off the coast of Africa. The climate was tropical and mild, tempered by trade winds. At the time, Saint Helena&#x27;s original ecosystem was almost intact, and goats introduced by the Portuguese thrived in the island&#x27;s untouched environment (no mammals or reptiles inhabited Saint Helena before introduction by explorers). The interior of Saint Helena was a thick old-growth forest of ancient gumwood trees and other native plants that had colonized the island as many as 10 million years ago.

The following is from a contemporary account of the first ship to encounter Lopes after he had been left on Saint Helena, found in a Hakluyt Society journal:

The cockerel that Lopes saved from the ship became his only friend on Saint Helena. During the night, it roosted above his head and during the day it followed behind him, and would come if he called to it. As time went on, Lopes began to be less and less afraid of people. When a ship would lay anchor in what would later be known as Jamestown harbour, Lopes would greet the sailors, talking to them as they came ashore. Lopes began to be considered something of a saint, because of his deformities and the fact that he would not leave Saint Helena for any reason. Many people thought him to be the embodiment of human suffering and alienation, and they took pity on him. The travelers who stopped at the island gave Lopes many things, including livestock and seeds. Eventually, Lopes became a gardener and a keeper of livestock, working the soil, planting fruit trees, grasses and many other forms of vegetation.

==Lopes visits Portugal and Rome==
After 10 years on the island, Lopes agreed to return to Portugal to see his family, visited King João III and then traveled to Rome, where Pope Clement VII absolved him of the sin of apostasy. The absolution occurred at Easter, 1530, in public (in those days, only the Pope could absolve the sin of apostasy, and he always did so in public, at Easter). The Pope was very impressed with Lopes, and decided to grant him a wish. Lopes had one desire, and that was to return to his home on the Island of Saint Helena. The Pope sent Lopes back to Portugal with a letter for João III, requesting that Lopes be transported back to Saint Helena. Lopes returned to the island and died there in 1545, after another 20 years of almost complete solitude.

<text>Death Row Records is an American record label that was founded in 1991 by The D.O.C., Dr. Dre, Suge Knight, and Dick Griffey. The label became a sensation by releasing multi-platinum hip-hop albums by West Coast-based artists such as Dr. Dre (&quot;The Chronic&quot;), Snoop Dogg (&quot;Doggystyle&quot;) and 2Pac (&quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;) during the 1990s. At its peak, Death Row was making over US $150 million a year.

By the late 1990s, the label began to decline after the death of its star artist, 2Pac, imprisonment of Suge Knight, and the departures of Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. Although Death Row was enjoying financial success, it was embroiled in controversies, lawsuits, and violence by its artists and associates.

Death Row Records filed for bankruptcy in 2006 and was auctioned to WIDEawake Entertainment for $18 million on January 15, 2009. The owner of WIDEawake went bankrupt in 2012; the label was sold to Entertainment One, and it then became a division of Hasbro until April 2021, when eOne Music was sold to the Blackstone Group. Snoop Dogg bought Death Row from MNRK Music Group in February 2022, intending to revive the label.

==History==
===1987–1992: Origins and the first generation===

In 1987, N.W.A&#x27;s Dr. Dre signed to Eazy-E&#x27;s Ruthless Records. As head of production at the label, Dr. Dre produced a large number of Ruthless projects, many of them successful; feeling the pressures of having to produce so many acts and feeling he was underpaid, Dr. Dre became frustrated with Ruthless. After the departure of Ice Cube in 1989 over financial disagreements with Jerry Heller, Suge Knight and the D.O.C. went over the books with a lawyer. Convinced that Jerry Heller and Eazy-E were dishonest, they approached Dr. Dre about forming a label with them, away from Heller and Eazy-E. Allegedly using strong-arm tactics, Suge Knight was able to procure contracts from Eazy-E for the D.O.C., Dr. Dre, Jewell, and Michel&#x27;le.

Dr. Dre and Suge Knight along with partners the D.O.C. and Dick Griffey began the process of starting a record label and music partnership in anticipation of Dr. Dre&#x27;s departure from Ruthless. Although the name of their new music venture was originally called Future Shock, both the D.O.C and Suge Knight&#x27;s business associate Michael &quot;Harry-O&quot; Harris have claimed to have suggested changing the name of the new label to &#x27;Def Row&#x27; (a play on Def Jam), but rights to the name were already owned by the Unknown DJ, who also happened to be one of Dre&#x27;s former music associates in the 1980s. Unknown stated in an interview that he created the name &quot;Def Row&quot; for a potential deal to start another record label under Morgan Creek. However he later sold the naming rights to Dr. Dre and his partners in July 1991 and by 1992 the name changed to its eventual title of Death Row Records. Knight approached Michael &quot;Harry-O&quot; Harris, a businessman imprisoned on drug and attempted murder charges. Through David Kenner, an attorney handling Harris&#x27;s appeal, Harry-O set up Godfather Entertainment, a parent company for the newly christened Death Row.

Knight approached Vanilla Ice (Robert Van Winkle), using management connections with Mario &quot;Chocolate&quot; Johnson, claiming Johnson had produced and co-written the song &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot;, and had not received royalties for it. After consulting with Alex Roberts, Knight and two bodyguards arrived at The Palm in West Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, where Van Winkle was eating. After shoving Van Winkle&#x27;s bodyguards aside, Knight sat down in front of Van Winkle, staring at him before asking &quot;How you doin&#x27;?&quot; Similar incidents were repeated on several occasions, including alleged attempts to lure Vanilla Ice into a van filled with Bloods and Crips, before Knight showed up at Vanilla Ice&#x27;s hotel suite on the 15th floor of the Bel Age Hotel, accompanied by Johnson and a member of the Los Angeles Raiders. According to Vanilla Ice, Knight took him out on the balcony by himself, and implied he would throw Vanilla Ice off unless he signed the rights to the song over to Knight; Van Winkle&#x27;s money helped fund Death Row. Death Row was initially located at the intersection of Westwood Blvd and Wilshire Blvd, later to be relocated to the intersection of Wilshire Blvd. and San Vicente Blvd.

===1992–1995: &quot;The Chronic&quot;, &quot;Doggystyle&quot;, and other releases===
With the help of Kenner, Knight began signing young, inner-city California-based artists and arranged for Death Row Records to contribute to the soundtrack for the 1992 film, &quot;Deep Cover&quot;. The single, &quot;Deep Cover&quot;, established Dr. Dre as a solo artist and a young Snoop Doggy Dogg as his protégé. Work soon began on &quot;The Chronic&quot;, Dr. Dre&#x27;s debut solo album, which heavily featured Snoop and the rest of the label&#x27;s core roster.

The album, which was released on December 15 and peaked at number 3 on the Billboard Top 200, went on to sell 5.7 million records worldwide, popularizing the distinctive style of G-Funk. The Death Row roster consisted of Dre, Snoop, Daz, Kurupt, Nate Dogg, The Lady of Rage, The D.O.C., Jewell, RBX, Soopafly and many more.

After Snoop Dogg found solo success through his features on The Chronic, Dre began producing Snoop Dogg&#x27;s debut album &quot;Doggystyle&quot; throughout 1993. Snoop&#x27;s debut was released on November 23, 1993 due to public demand and high pressure from retailers. Though unfinished, it outperformed &quot;The Chronic&quot; at Quadruple Platinum, and garnered similarly glowing reviews. Soon after the release of the album, Snoop Dogg was charged with murder, fueling the debate that politicians C. Delores Tucker and vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle sparked by criticizing gangsta rap for being against American values, degrading to black women, and encouraging violence towards police officers. Throughout 1994, Death Row Records released the soundtracks &quot;Above the Rim&quot; and &quot;Murder Was the Case&quot;.

On November 22, 1994, at the offices of The Brotherhood Crusade in Los Angeles, Suge Knight and several artists from Death Row such as Tha Dogg Pound as well as DJ Quik distributed nearly 2,000 turkeys to the public. Death Row also donated turkeys the following year as well.

On March 13, 1995, Death Row Records hosted a private party at the El Rey Theatre, where Kelly Jamerson, a Rolling 60&#x27;s Crip, was severely beaten by several Bloods, who were allegedly from Suge Knight&#x27;s inner circle. As a result of his injuries, Jamerson died the next day at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.

=== 1995–1996: Signing 2Pac, Bad Boy Records feud, Dr. Dre&#x27;s departure ===
After an August visit to see 2Pac at Clinton Correctional Facility in northern New York state, Suge traveled southward to New York City to join Death Row&#x27;s entourage to the 2nd Annual Source Awards ceremony. Already reputed for strongarm tactics on the Los Angeles rap scene, after giving a brief comment of support for Shakur, Suge used his brief stage time mainly to disparage Sean &quot;Puff Daddy&quot; Combs, CEO of Bad Boy Records, the label then leading New York rap scene. Knight criticized Combs for his habit of ad-libbing on his artists&#x27; music as well as making numerous cameo appearances in his artists&#x27; music videos. Suge then invited artists seeking the spotlight for themselves to join Death Row. Eventually, Puff recalled that to preempt severe retaliation from his Bad Boy crew, he had promptly confronted Suge, whose reply—that he had meant Jermaine Dupri, of So So Def Recordings, in Atlanta—was politic enough to deescalate the conflict.

Still, among the fans, the previously diffuse rivalry between America&#x27;s two mainstream rap scenes had instantly flared already. And while in New York, Suge visited Uptown Records, where Puff, under its founder Andre Harrell, had started in the music business through an internship. Apparently without paying Uptown, Suge obtained the releases of Puff&#x27;s prime Uptown recruits Jodeci, its producer DeVante Swing, and Mary J. Blige, all then signing with Suge&#x27;s management company.

On September 24, 1995, at Jermaine Dupri&#x27;s birthday party at the Platinum House nightclub in Atlanta, Georgia, Bad Boy&#x27;s entourage entered a heated dispute with Suge and Suge&#x27;s friend Jai Hassan-Jamal &quot;Big Jake&quot; Robles, a Campanella Park Piru Bloods gang member and Death Row bodyguard. According to eyewitnesses, including a Fulton County sheriff working there as a nightclub bouncer, Puff had heatedly disputed with Suge inside the club. Several minutes later, outside the club, Puff&#x27;s childhood friend and own bodyguard, Anthony &quot;Wolf&quot; Jones was involved in a heated altercation with others that ultimately led to Robles being fatally shot while entering a Limousine.

The attorneys of Puff and Jones both denied any involvement by their clients, while Puff&#x27;s lawyer added that Puff had not even been with his bodyguard that night. Over 20 years later, the case remains officially unresolved, and Jones himself was fatally shot in Atlanta in November 2003 during an altercation with the Black Mafia Family. Yet immediately and persistently, Suge blamed Puff, cementing the enmity between the two bosses, whose two record labels dominated the rap genre&#x27;s two mainstream centers.

In October 1995, Knight visited 2Pac in prison again and posted $1.4 million bond. 2Pac began work on his Death Row album, kicking off his tenure by insulting the Notorious B.I.G., Junior M.A.F.I.A. and Puff Daddy (the founder of Bad Boy Records), whom he accused of setting him up to be robbed and shot at Quad Studios on November 30, 1994, as well as Mobb Deep, Jay-Z, A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, Jimmy Henchman, the Fugees and Nas. Tha Dogg Pound&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Dogg Food&quot;, continued the label&#x27;s streak of commercial successes; its members – rappers Kurupt and Daz Dillinger – then joined Snoop in ridiculing New York rappers with their single &quot;New York, New York&quot;, featuring Snoop Dogg. The video, set in New York City, New York, was also heightened when the set was fired upon in a drive-by. After the shooting, Snoop Dogg and Tha Dogg Pound filmed scenes kicking down a building in New York. The single provoked a response called &#x27;&quot;L.A., L.A.&quot; by East Coast rappers Capone-N-Noreaga, Tragedy Khadafi, and Mobb Deep.

Another report was that Sam Sneed was beaten in one of the label&#x27;s meetings by a group of Death Row affiliates, led by Suge Knight and 2Pac. According to Daz Dillinger, the reason this happened was that Sam Sneed had too many East Coast rappers in his &quot;Lady Heroin&quot; music video. Disillusioned with the direction of Death Row, artists RBX and the D.O.C. chose to leave, after which Suge Knight exercised tighter control over the rest of the roster. &quot;Dogg Food&quot; was not produced by Dr. Dre but was mixed by Dr. Dre, a further testament to Dre&#x27;s dwindling involvement with Death Row. Dr. Dre also grew tired of Knight&#x27;s violence within the label, although he contributed toward two tracks on 2Pac&#x27;s &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;. The rest of the tracks on the album, however, were mostly produced by Daz Dillinger and Johnny J, despite Dr. Dre being nominally titled as Executive Producer. 2Pac&#x27;s behavior reportedly became erratic as he continued his verbal wars with the Notorious B.I.G., Bad Boy Records, Puff Daddy, Mobb Deep, and Prodigy, including many violent confrontations with many of those rappers at some points. On March 22, 1996, due to the infighting, Dr. Dre officially left Death Row Records to found Aftermath, which provoked 2Pac to turn against Dr. Dre.

Suge Knight&#x27;s relationship with MC Hammer dates back to 1988. With the success of Hammer&#x27;s 1994 album, &quot;The Funky Headhunter&quot;, Hammer signed with Death Row in 1995, along with his close friend, Tupac. The label did not release the album of M.C. Hammer&#x27;s music (titled &quot;Too Tight&quot;), although he did release versions of some tracks on his next album. However, Hammer did record tracks with Shakur and others, most notably the song &quot;Too Late Playa&quot; (along with Big Daddy Kane and Danny Boy). After the death of Tupac in 1996, MC Hammer left the label.

===1996–2001: Tupac Shakur&#x27;s murder, Suge Knight&#x27;s incarceration, and decline===

Formerly a united front of artists, Death Row&#x27;s roster fractured into separate camps. Daz, now head producer, worked on Snoop Dogg&#x27;s second album &quot;Tha Doggfather&quot;, which featured Bad Azz and Techniec of the LBC Crew, Warren G and Nate Dogg of his group 213 and Tha Dogg Pound. 2Pac shut himself into the studio with Hurt-M-Badd and Big &quot;D&quot;, crafting &quot;The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory&quot; - unlike &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;, it was devoid of high-profile Death Row guest appearances, instead showcasing The Outlawz and Bad Azz, and had a much darker tone. Suge Knight was now barely reachable by his staff, and employees were assaulted as punishment for not following orders.

In New York City for the MTV Video Music Awards, 2Pac was interviewed on Death Row East, an East Coast subsidiary branch of Death Row. It was also during this time that Alex Roberts and David Kenner had been seen at Suge Knight&#x27;s Vegas Club 662, in discussion about the possibility of having Roberts&#x27; New York underworld connections help pave the way for Death Row East. The record label was supposed to be run by Eric B. and Big D with Craig Mack being the first artist signed to the label. On September 7, 1996, Suge Knight and 2Pac were caught on surveillance camera at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas attacking gang member Orlando Anderson, who was a member of the South Side Compton Crips street gang. Later that night, 2Pac was shot four times in a drive-by shooting in the front seat of Suge Knight&#x27;s BMW 750iL waiting at a red traffic light at crossroads; en route to Knight&#x27;s Las Vegas Club 662; despite living six days in critical condition, 2Pac died on September 13, 1996. He was 25 years old.

2Pac&#x27;s &quot;The Don Killuminati: 7 Day Theory&quot; was released in November 1996, just one week before Snoop Dogg&#x27;s &quot;Tha Doggfather&quot;, which both achieved Multi-Platinum sales. The following months, Death Row released &quot;Death Row Greatest Hits&quot;, &quot;Christmas on Death Row&quot;, &quot;Gridlock&#x27;d&quot;, and &quot;Gang Related&quot;. Nate Dogg&#x27;s album, &quot;G-Funk Classics, Vol. 1&quot; was supposed to be released on January 14, 1997, but got shelved due to issues at Death Row Records, despite getting released independently as a double disc the following year.

On February 28, Suge Knight was convicted of probation violation and sentenced to nine years in prison, causing Interscope to drop their distribution deal with the label.

Suge Knight&#x27;s control over the label diminished, as Nate Dogg was able to leave, followed by Snoop Dogg and Kurupt. The Lady of Rage left after the release of her solo album Necessary Roughness to pursue an acting career, so did Michel&#x27;le with Hung Jury. Daz Dillinger departed in 1999 after the release of his debut album Retaliation, Revenge and Get Back, but produced for Big C-Style, and he later formed D.P.G. Recordz. During Knight&#x27;s incarceration, Death Row released &quot;Suge Knight Represents: Chronic 2000&quot; and &quot;Too Gangsta for Radio&quot;, which both received negative reviews. Both albums had the label&#x27;s new signees, Tha Realest and YGD Tha Top Dogg, who were criticized for imitating the styles, looks, and vocals of 2Pac and Snoop Dogg. Also, &quot;Dead Man Walkin&#x27;&quot;, a Snoop Dogg compilation of unreleased recordings, was released without his authorization.

===2001–2005: Knight&#x27;s release, return to prison, second generation===
Maintaining artistic control from behind bars, Suge Knight launched smear campaigns against his former artists, most notably Snoop Dogg, death threats were exchanged, and Snoop Dogg responded by publicly dissing Suge Knight, leaving the label, and later releasing a diss track named &quot;Pimp Slapp&#x27;d&quot;, critically acclaimed by music magazine &quot;Complex&quot;. The label supported itself with releases pulled from vaults—most successfully various posthumous 2Pac albums, along with Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg re-releases. He signed new talent, including Crooked I, who had been lighting up the Californian underground with his rhyming ability, particularly the Wake Up Show with Sway &amp; King Tech.

On August 6, 2001, Suge Knight was released from prison. Despite bad blood, Kurupt would again sign with Suge Knight in exchange for the position of Vice President, which sparked a feud between himself and Daz Dillinger and Snoop Dogg. He began work on &quot;Against tha Grain&quot;; his verbal feud with his former partners continued from 2002 to 2005. The same year, Knight decided to enter the UK market with Death Row Records operating as an independent record label in conjunction with the Ritz Music Group, a company known for its success with Irish country music artists such as Daniel O&#x27;Donnell The joint-venture signed British R&amp;B singer Mark Morrison to a five-year deal with Death Row Records UK, with a single called &quot;Thank God It&#x27;s Friday&quot; and an album called &quot;Innocent Man&quot; scheduled for a 2002 release. However, the single did not chart in the UK and the album ended up being released by footballer Kevin Campbell&#x27;s record label 2 Wikid, before being re-issued in 2006 by Mona Records.

Left Eye, member of the R&amp;B girl group TLC signed with Death Row after finishing her solo deal with Arista who released her first album &quot;Supernova&quot; in 2001. At this time, Death Row changed into Tha Row Records. Lopes joined to record a second solo album under the pseudonym N.I.N.A. (New Identity Not Applicable), while also working on TLC&#x27;s new album &quot;3D&quot;. N.I.N.A. was canceled after her death in April 2002. The album was leaked online in 2011.

After promoting his new talent from prison, directing a campaign against his former artists and exacerbating the conflict between Daz Dillinger, Snoop Dogg and Kurupt, Suge had still yet to release any albums by his new artists. After Kurupt&#x27;s second departure, &quot;Against tha Grain&quot; was released; soon after, citing dissatisfaction with serving five years on the label and seeing no release, Rapper Crooked I left Death Row, eventually filing a gag order on Knight to prevent him from interfering with him finding a new deal. Petey Pablo, who had signed in 2005 and started the never-released album &quot;Same Eyez on Me&quot;, left along with rapper Tha Realest in 2006.

===2006–2022: Bankruptcy, closure, WIDEawake, Hasbro===
On April 4, 2006, both Death Row Records and Suge Knight simultaneously filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following the appointment of a Receiver to acquire and auction off assets of both Death Row Records and Suge Knight in the civil case filed by Lydia Harris. Among those listed as unsecured creditors to Death Row include the Harrises ($107 million), the Internal Revenue Service ($6.9 million), Koch Records ($3.4 million), Interscope Records ($2.5 million) and a number of artists previously signed to the label. Suge Knight eventually lost control of Death Row Records and his personal assets when Chapter 11 Trustees took over both cases.

On January 15, 2009, Death Row Records was successfully auctioned for $18 million to Ontario-based WIDEawake Entertainment Group that was founded in 2008 by Lara Lavi, with financing from New Solutions Financial Corporation. On January 25, 2009, a public auction was held for everything found in Death Row&#x27;s office after it filed for bankruptcy. Of note was the Death Row electric chair which went for US$2,500. Lavi was removed from WIDEawake and Robert Thompson-So of New Solutions took over day-to-day operations. Lavi then sued her former company WIDEawake, along with New Solutions and Thompson-So in New York County Court on November 19, 2009.

WIDEawake issued previously unreleased material from such artists as Kurupt, Danny Boy, Crooked I, Sam Sneed, LBC Crew, Jewell and O.F.T.B. Dr. Dre&#x27;s, &quot;The Chronic Re-Lit&quot; was released on September 1, 2009 and contained &quot;The Chronic&quot; remastered with seven unreleased songs featuring Snoop Dogg, CPO, Kurupt, Jewell, and a bonus DVD containing a Dr. Dre interview, a Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg mini movie, and television commercials for the original &quot;The Chronic&quot;. The album also contained a scene from an unfinished feature film entitled, SAIGON, CA, which was to launch WIDEawake&#x27;s film studio. &quot;Death Row The Lost Sessions Vol 1&quot; by Snoop Dogg was released October 13, 2009 and contained 15 previously unreleased tracks, including some produced by Dr. Dre. &quot;Death Row: The Ultimate Collection&quot; was released on November 24 and was a special box set containing three audio CDs (one greatest hits disc and two discs of unreleased content), one DVD of music videos including the unreleased Dr. Dre music video &quot;Puffin&#x27; On Blunts&quot;.

On December 5, 2012, Jonathan Hay, a former Death Row publicist reported through HipHopDX that New Solutions Financial Corporation, the Canadian company that owned WIDEawake Death Row, had gone bankrupt and sold both the label and catalog to a publicly held company in a deal that would be closed on December 10. In 2013, Entertainment One purchased the rights to the Death Row catalog. New Solutions Financial Corporation was eventually exposed as an alleged Ponzi scheme.

On August 23, 2019, American toy company Hasbro announced a $4 billion purchase of eOne, making them the owners of Death Row Records. In April 2021, Hasbro and Entertainment One announced it would sell-off eOne Music to The Blackstone Group, which its acquisition was completed in June 2021.

=== 2022–present: Revival through Snoop Dogg and third generation ===
On February 9, 2022, ahead of the release of his next album and his appearance in the Super Bowl LVI halftime show, Snoop Dogg announced that he would acquire the rights to the Death Row Records trademarks from MNRK Music Group (the renamed eOne Music). The sale did not immediately include rights to the label&#x27;s catalog, but it was reported that he was nearing a deal to acquire the catalogs of himself and other Death Row artists from MNRK. On February 11, 2022, Snoop Dogg released his third studio album on Death Row Records, marking a 26-year lapse from the label after Tha Doggfather album.

Snoop Dogg&#x27;s purchase of Death Row Records did not include the rights to Tupac or Dr. Dre&#x27;s albums originally which those rights have been reverted back to Interscope Records. On March 4, 2022, in an interview with Tidal, Snoop Dogg stated he acquired the rights to all the albums previously released on Death Row Records, including his debut studio album &quot;Doggystyle&quot; and Dr. Dre&#x27;s &quot;The Chronic.&quot; Despite the interview, Dr. Dre&#x27;s lawyer, Howard King, later refuted the &quot;false reports&quot; two days later, stating that Dre still retains total control of &quot;The Chronic&quot;, which came back to streaming services on February 1, 2023. On April 18, 2022, it was announced that Death Row Records would have its own streaming service, which pays higher royalties to its artists than main music streaming services.

In December 2022, Snoop Dogg sold a stake of Death Row&#x27;s catalogue to former Apple Music&#x27;s Global Creative Director Larry Jackson&#x27;s music label Gamma. During the onset of 2023, Jane Handcocks&#x27;s &quot;World of Women&quot; and October London&#x27;s &quot;The Rebirth of Marvin&quot; were released. On February 12, 2023, Snoop Dogg announced that Death Row&#x27;s catalogue would return to TikTok via association with music distribution company SoundOn. Death Row&#x27;s catalogue returned to all music streaming services on March 9, 2023.

== Gang violence ==

Death Row Records has been referred to as &quot;the most controversial record label in history&quot;, due to Suge Knight&#x27;s practice of hiring gang members and the gang-related violence which plagued the record label. Knight, who was a member of the Mob Piru Bloods, hired gang members from his set, as well as other sets, including the Fruit Town Piru and Lueders Park Piru. There have been several murders committed by gang members affiliated with Death Row Records. Furthermore, many of the Bloods who worked for the record label would eventually be murdered.

=== Murder of William &quot;Rat&quot; Ratcliffe ===
In 1995, an aspiring rapper and member of the Bounty Hunter Bloods named William &quot;Rat&quot; Ratcliffe was pressuring Suge Knight to sign him to Death Row Records. After Ratcliffe confronted Knight with 10 other Bounty Hunter Bloods, Knight ordered Wardell &quot;Poochie&quot; Fouse, who was a fellow Mob Piru member, to kill Ratcliffe.

=== Murder of the Notorious B.I.G. ===

After the murder of Tupac Shakur, Knight was incarcerated due to probation violations. Knight held Sean Combs, the CEO of Bad Boy Records, responsible for the death of Shakur and sought revenge. Through his then-girlfriend Theresa Swann, the incarcerated Knight contacted Wardell Fouse and hired him to kill The Notorious B.I.G. Swann was given $25,000, of which $13,000 would go to Fouse.

During the initial investigation into Wallace&#x27;s murder, Fouse was not a suspect, as detective Russell Poole&#x27;s prime suspects were the LAPD officer David Mack and Mack&#x27;s friend Amir Muhammed (Harry Billups). After Poole resigned from the department in 1999, the case stalled. After the case was reopened in 2006, the lead detective, Greg Kading, concluded that Wardell Fouse was the shooter. As Fouse was murdered in 2003, no charges were pressed against him.

=== Feud between the Mob Piru and Fruit Town Piru ===
By the early 2000s, a rivalry had developed between the Mob Piru Bloods and the Fruit Town Piru Bloods, resulting in the deaths of several Mob Pirus associated with Death Row Records, including (but not limited to):

* Alton &quot;Buntry&quot; McDonald, who was shot dead on April 3, 2002, allegedly by George Williams, who also went by the nicknames &quot;G&quot; or &quot;Ponytail&quot;.
* Henry &quot;Hendog&quot; Smith, who designed the logo for Death Row Records. Smith was shot dead on October 16, 2002. Smith was killed by a member of the Denver Lanes Bloods.
* Wardell &quot;Poochie&quot; Fouse, who was shot dead on July 24, 2003.

This feud started when George &quot;G&quot; Williams, who worked as a bodyguard for Suge Knight, was fired after he failed to return two Death Row Records cars which he borrowed. After Williams was fired, he became a close associate of Rodrick Cardale &quot;Lil Rod&quot; Reed, a Fruit Town Piru member. The pair are alleged to be behind the murders of the Mob Piru Bloods from Death Row Records.

<text>Grafton (Bundjalung: &quot;Gumbin Gir&quot;) is a city in the Northern Rivers region of the Australian state of New South Wales. It is located on the Clarence River, on a floodplain, approximately by road north-northeast of the state capital Sydney.

The closest major cities, Brisbane and the Gold Coast, are located across the border in South East Queensland. At the 2021 census, Grafton had a population of 19,255. The city is the largest settlement and, with Maclean, the shared administrative centre of the Clarence Valley Council local government area, which is home to over 50,000 people in all.

==History==
Before European settlement, the Clarence River marked the border between the Bundjalung and Gumbaynggirr peoples, and so descendants of the speakers of both language-groups can now be found in the Grafton region.

Grafton, like many other settlements in the area, was first opened up to European settlement by the cedar-getters. An escaped convict, Richard Craig, explored the district in 1831. With the wealth of &quot;red gold&quot; cedar just waiting for exploitation, he was given a pardon and one hundred pounds to bring a party of cedar-getters on the cutter &quot;Prince George&quot; to the region. Word of such wealth to be had did not take long to spread. One of the arrivals on the &quot;Susan&quot; in 1838, pioneer John Small, first occupied land on Woodford Island. &#x27;The Settlement&#x27; (as the embryonic Grafton was then imaginatively named) was established shortly after.
In 1851 Governor FitzRoy officially named the town Grafton, after his grandfather, the Duke of Grafton, who had served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1768 to 1770. Grafton was proclaimed a city in 1885. Local industries include logging, beef cattle, fishing/prawning, sugar, manufacturing and tourism.

The Grafton Bridge, connecting the main townsite with South Grafton, opened in 1932. It completed the standard-gauge rail connection between Sydney and Brisbane, also forming a vital link for the Pacific Highway. Previously the only way to travel from Grafton to South Grafton was via ferry. As a result, South Grafton developed quite a separate identity, and in fact had its own municipal government from 1896 to 1956.

The introduction of fluoride to the town water supply in 1964 was accompanied by protest which became physical. The fluoride plant was blown up the night before commencement, the dentist supporting fluoridation received bomb threats against his family and later pro- and anti-fluoridation float participants at the annual Jacaranda Festival came to blows and a gun was produced.

== Heritage listings ==
Grafton has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Duke Street: Christ Church Cathedral
* 170 Hoof Street: Grafton Correctional Centre
* North Coast railway: Grafton Bridge
* 95 Prince Street: Saraton Theatre
* 150 Victoria Street: Arcola, Grafton

== Demographics ==
At the 2021 census, Grafton had a population of 19,255.

According to the Census:
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 10.4% of Grafton&#x27;s population.
* 87.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 1.4% and New Zealand 0.7%.
* 90.5% of people spoke only English at home.
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 37.8%, Anglican 20.9%, and Catholic 18.2%.

==Climate==
Grafton has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;, Trewartha: &quot;Cfal&quot;) with significantly more rainfall in summer than in winter. Rainfall is lower than in stations directly on the coast, but monthly rain totals can often surpass . The wettest month since records began was March 1974 when Cyclone Zoe produced a monthly total of , whilst during periods of anticyclonic control and strong westerly winds monthly rainfall can be very low; for instance in August 2017 only fell. Grafton gets around 115.2 clear days on an annual basis.

Grafton like many NSW regional centres, is affected by heatwaves in the summer months. On 12 February 2017 Grafton recorded a maximum temperature of 46.3 °C (115.3 °F), the city&#x27;s highest recorded temperature since records began in 1966. Winter has a relatively high diurnal range.

==Culture==

Grafton is known and promoted as the Jacaranda City, in reference to its tree-lined streets and to the annual Jacaranda Festival. Inaugurated in 1935, Jacaranda is held each October/November. A half-day public holiday is observed locally on the first Thursday of November, the Festival&#x27;s major focal day. During the 1963 festival, inventor John W. Dickenson demonstrated on the Clarence River the first hang glider that was controlled by weight shifts of the pilot from a swinging control frame – the birth of modern hang gliding.

A half-day public holiday is also observed for the Grafton Cup horse race, held each year on the second Thursday in July. It is the high point of the city&#x27;s annual Racing Carnival—Australia&#x27;s largest and richest non-metropolitan Carnival—which takes place over a fortnight in that month.

Grafton is the birthplace of several renowned country music players. Local artist Troy Cassar-Daley received four Golden Guitar awards at the 2006 Tamworth Country Music Awards—the largest and most prestigious country music awards in Australia. At the same event Samantha McClymont, the 2005/2006 Grafton Jacaranda Queen and sister of Brooke McClymont, also received an award for her country music talent.

A vision of Grafton with its numerous brilliantly-flowered trees in bloom is immortalised in Australian popular music in Cold Chisel&#x27;s song &quot;Flame Trees&quot;, written by band member Don Walker, who had lived in Grafton during his formative years.

==Sports==
The most popular sport in Grafton is Rugby league. There are two clubs from Grafton in the Group 2 Rugby League competition; the Grafton Ghosts and their arch-rival South Grafton Rebels. The two clubs each have a rich history, and derbies between the clubs have been known to draw attendances in excess of 3000 people.

Other sports such as soccer, Rugby union, Australian rules and Field Hockey are also played in Grafton.

==Notable buildings==

Christ Church Cathedral, designed by John Horbury Hunt, was consecrated in 1884 and is the seat of the Anglican Diocese of Grafton.

Schaeffer House is a historic 1900 Federation house and contains the collection of the Clarence River Historical Society, which was formed in 1931.

==Transportation==

The Murwillumbah railway line was extended to Grafton in 1905; The North Coast Line reached South Grafton&#x27;s railway station from Sydney in 1915. Pending the opening of the combined road and rail bascule bridge in 1932, Grafton had a train ferry to connect the two railways. Clarence Valley Regional Airport is the airport that services Grafton.

Until bypassed in May 2020, the Pacific Highway, the main North–South road route through Eastern Australia, passed through Grafton and linked it to the Gwydir Highway, one of the primary east–west routes through Eastern Australia.

Busways is the operator for local routes, as well as out-of-town routes to Junction Hill, Jackadgery/Cangai, Copmanhurst, and Maclean and Yamba.

Lawrence Bus Service operates a shopper service, as well as school service on school days, to and from Lawrence.

Northern Rivers Buslines operates a weekday service to Lismore via Maclean, Evans Head and Coraki.

NSW TrainLink operates a coach service to Byron Bay, connecting off the train from Sydney. It also offers a coach service to Moree via Glen Innes, connecting from the train from Brisbane.

==Industry==
From 1904 to 1917 the Grafton Copper Mining Company operated a copper mine, smelter and tramway at Cangai, more than 100 km from Grafton via the Clarence and Mann rivers, today about 70 km over the Gwydir Highway. From 1952 to 1997, first as an independent company, then owned by Tooheys since 1961, the Grafton brewery provided Grafton Bitter to the North Coast. The nearby Harwood Mill is the oldest working sugar mill in New South Wales.

<text>Ludwig Derangadage Scotty (born 20 June 1948) is a Nauruan politician who twice served as President of Nauru and was Speaker of Parliament five times between 2000 and 2016. He served as president from 29 May 2003 to 8 August 2003 and again from 22 June 2004 until his ousting in a vote of no confidence on 19 December 2007. He was elected as president in 2003, again from November 2010 to April 2013, and from June 2013 to June 2016.

==Background and earlier career==

Scotty grew up in Anabar in the north of Nauru; he attended secondary school from 1960 until 1964 and studied law at the University of the South Pacific in the Fijian capital city Suva. On 15 March 1983 he was first elected to the Parliament for his district Anbar; in his longtime tenure as parliament member Scotty was the chairman of the Bank of Nauru, the Nauru Rehabilitation Corporation and in the board of directors of Air Nauru.

He served as Speaker of Parliament from April 2000 to March 2001, May 2001 to December 2002, February 2004 to April 2004, November 2010 to April 2013, and June 2013 to July 2016, while representing the Anabar district.
He was appointed as Minister Assisting the President of Nauru in the cabinet of Derog Gioura from March 2003 to May 2003.

==President of Nauru 2003==

At the end of the short administration of Derog Gioura, Ludwig Scotty was elected President of Nauru by a parliamentary vote of 10–7, defeating Centre Party leader and former President Kinza Clodumar.

President Scotty&#x27;s cabinet included himself as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Baron D. Waqa of Boe as Minister of Education, David Adeang of Ubenide as Minister of Finance, Dr. Kieren Keke of Yaren as Minister of Health, Russel E. Kun of Ubenide as Minister of Justice and Dogabe A. Jeremiah of Meneng as Minister of Public Works.

Ludwig Scotty was ousted in a vote of no confidence in August 2003 and was replaced as president by René Harris.

==Period in Opposition 2003–2004==

Scotty spent a short period in Opposition from August 2003 until June 2004, remaining a member of the Parliament of Nauru.

==President of Nauru 2004–2007==

Ludwig Scotty returned as president on 22 June 2004 after a member of Harris&#x27;s faction of the Parliament of Nauru defected. Ludwig was re-elected to Parliament in elections in October 2004, and most of his allies also did well. In this term, Scotty became the first president of Nauru to give up the foreign affairs ministry, as David Adeang was appointed to that position.

Scotty&#x27;s government implemented major reforms to restore the country&#x27;s economy.

Scotty and his supporters won a landslide victory in the parliamentary election held on 25 August 2007. On 28 August, Scotty was re-elected as president with the support of 14 of the 18 members of parliament, defeating Marcus Stephen.

Despite the grave problems which the Nauruan authorities faced in the early 21st Century, the years under the Presidency of Ludwig Scotty saw some measure of stability return to the island Republic, albeit constrained by austerity measures. The liberal use of Parliamentary no-confidence motions, the occasion of many crises of government over several years, seemed initially to have subsided under Ludwig Scotty&#x27;s widely respected tenure of office. A constitutional review was being proceeded with, with a view to improving the functioning of Parliament and the offices of state.

On 13 November 2007, a motion of no-confidence against Scotty&#x27;s government was unsuccessful; although a majority of those voting supported the motion (eight in favor, seven opposed), it fell short of the necessary nine votes. The motion was led by Dr. Kieren Keke, and it was based on allegations of misconduct on the part of Adeang and Scotty&#x27;s unwillingness to act against Adeang.

On 19 December 2007, however, a newly comprised majority in Parliament did succeed in ousting President Scotty through a new vote of no confidence (ten votes in favour, seven opposed). The motion was based on the same causes as the November vote. Marcus Stephen was sworn in as President of Nauru.

==Post-Presidency and legacy==

Ludwig Scotty remained a member of the Parliament of Nauru, following the no confidence defeat in Parliament of his Administration in 2007. Coming as it did only a few months after the landslide victory of his supporters at the polls in August 2007, his relinquishing of office so soon afterwards can be seen in terms of an element of promise and expectations unfilled.

It remained to be seen whether Scotty, who turned 60 in 2008, and whose Administration was replaced by a ministerial team several of whom were many years his junior, would in the future seek a further term of office as president. His second Administration of 2004 - 2007, however, is increasingly regarded by some observers as one which was characterized by relative stability for the Republic of Nauru in contrast with the political upheavals and crises which occurred before and after this Administration. It also arguably represented a period when the Nauru electorate and their representatives were appearing to come to terms with being educated into the perceived need for economic austerity measures and the disciplines which coincided with them, and into a broader reflection on improvements in political culture. In the earlier part of 2008, somewhat of an oblique compliment was being paid to constitutional review process identified with Scotty when both Government and Opposition were claiming it as part of their legacy.

In April 2008 Scotty stood again for the Parliament of Nauru and was reelected to serve as a Member.

In March 2010 former President Scotty intervened the constitutional reform debate. Mr Scotty doubted whether changes proposed by the current Government of Nauru commanded popular support.

===Speaker of Parliament===
Scotty served his first two terms as speaker from April 2000 to March 2001, and May 2001 to December 2002, after which he was elected as president.

In November 2010, Scotty was elected Speaker of the House again, breaking a 6-month deadlock which had paralysed the government. His election as Speaker enabled MPs to elect a President, and Marcus Stephen was duly re-elected President of Nauru. Scotty explained that he remained a member of the Opposition to Stephen&#x27;s government (though he would of course carry out his duties in an impartial manner), but that he had accepted the position of Speaker so that Parliament could function (giving the Opposition a say in government), and so that a budget could be adopted. He explained that his decision was also due to the allegations over Opposition members receiving financial support from Australian company Getax. Speaker Scotty resigned on 18 April 2013 amid increasing parliamentary deadlock and infighting, started over his own attempt to dissolve Parliament, he was temporarily succeeded by Deputy Speaker Landon Deireragea who served as acting speaker until 25 April when Godfrey Thoma was elected as Speaker after being nominated by former President Marcus Stephen.

Scotty was returned to the chair after the 2013 parliamentary election as the nominee of the government of Baron Waqa. Scotty was elected with 14 votes to 5 five for opposition nominee Kieren Keke. His deputy is newly elected MP Ranin Akua who was elected unopposed.

<doc id="263611" wikidata="Q736627" url="?curid=263611" title="Montréal–Trudeau International Airport">
<text>Montréal–Trudeau International Airport () or Montréal–Trudeau, formerly known and still commonly referred to as Montréal–Dorval International Airport (&quot;Aéroport international Montréal-Dorval&quot;), is an international airport in Dorval, Quebec, Canada. It is the only Transport Canada designated international airport serving Montreal and is situated west of Downtown Montreal. The airport terminals are located entirely in the suburb of Dorval, while one runway is located in the Montreal borough of Saint-Laurent. Air Canada, the country&#x27;s flag carrier, also has its corporate headquarters complex on the Saint-Laurent side of the airport. It also serves Greater Montreal and adjacent regions in Quebec and eastern Ontario, as well as the states of Vermont and northern New York in the United States. The airport is named in honour of Pierre Trudeau, the 15th Prime Minister of Canada.

The airport is one of two managed and operated by Aéroports de Montréal (ADM), a not-for-profit corporation without share capital; the other is Montréal–Mirabel northwest of Montreal, which was initially intended to replace the one in Dorval but now deals almost solely with cargo and private flights. Montréal–Trudeau is owned by Transport Canada which has a 60-year lease with Aéroports de Montréal, as per Canada&#x27;s National Airport Policy of 1994.

Trudeau is the busiest airport in the province of Quebec and the third-busiest airport in Canada by passenger traffic, with 22.4 million passengers in 2024. It is one of eight Canadian airports with United States border preclearance and is one of the main gateways into Canada with 15.79 million or 71% of its passengers being on non-domestic flights, the highest proportion amongst Canada&#x27;s airports. YUL has also risen to become the 5th busiest transatlantic hub in North America. The route between Montreal and Paris is Canada&#x27;s busiest international route and the 6th busiest international route from North America, with more than 1.5 million passengers a year. It is one of three Air Canada hubs and, in that capacity, serves mainly Quebec, the Atlantic Provinces and Eastern Ontario. On an average day, 58,000 passengers transit through Montréal-Trudeau.

Airlines servicing Trudeau offer year-round non-stop flights to five continents, namely Africa, Asia, Europe, North and South America. It is one of only two airports in Canada with non-stop flights to five continents, the other being Toronto Pearson International Airport. Trudeau airport is the headquarters of and a large hub for Air Canada, the country&#x27;s largest airline. It is also the headquarters of Air Inuit and Air Transat, and an operation base for Sunwing Airlines and Porter Airlines. It also plays a role in general aviation as home to the headquarters of Innotech-Execair, Starlink, ACASS and Maintenance Repair &amp; Overhaul (MRO) facilities of Air Transat and Air Inuit. Transport Canada operates a Civil Aviation Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul facility on site, with a fleet of Government owned and operated civil aircraft. Bombardier Aerospace has an assembly facility on site where they build Global and Challenger business jets.

==History==

===Early years===

By the 1940s, it was increasingly clear that Montreal&#x27;s original airport, Saint-Hubert Airport, in operation since 1927, was no longer adequate for the city&#x27;s needs. The Minister of Transport purchased land at the Dorval Race Track, which was considered the best location for an enlarged airport because of its good weather conditions and few foggy days. The airport opened on September 1, 1941, as Dorval Airport/Aéroport Dorval with three paved runways. By 1946 the airport was hosting more than a quarter of a million passengers a year, growing to more than a million in the mid-1950s. During World War II thousands of Allied aircraft passed through Dorval on the way to England. At one time Dorval was the major transatlantic hub for commercial aviation and the busiest airport in Canada, with flights from airlines such as British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC).
Until 1959, it also doubled as RCAF Station Lachine.

===Growth===

In November 1960, the airport was renamed Montreal–Dorval International Airport/Aéroport international Dorval de Montréal. On December 15 of that year the Minister of Transport inaugurated a new $30 million terminal. The structure was built by Illsley, Templeton, Archibald, and Larose. At its height, it was the largest terminal in Canada and one of the biggest in the world. It was the gateway to Canada for all European air traffic and served more than two million passengers per year. Eight years later, Montréal–Dorval International Airport underwent a major expansion program. Despite this, the government of Prime Minister of Canada Pierre Elliott Trudeau (who represented a Montreal riding) predicted that Dorval would be completely saturated by 1985 and also projected that 20 million passengers would be passing through Montreal&#x27;s airports annually. They decided to construct a new airport in Sainte-Scholastique, what became Montréal–Mirabel International Airport. As the first phase in the transition that would eventually have seen Dorval closed, all international flights (except those to and from the United States) were to be transferred to the new airport in 1975.

===The opening and closing of Mirabel Airport===
The Trudeau government had developed Mirabel Airport to handle an expected growth in international traffic and eventually, to replace Dorval. On November 29, 1975, Mirabel International Airport went into service. With an operations zone of and a buffer zone of , it became the largest airport in the world. Many connecting flights to Canadian centres were transferred to Mirabel and 23 international airlines moved their overseas activities there. As a consequence, Montréal–Dorval was repurposed to serve domestic flights and transborder flights to the United States, to eventually shift these activities to Mirabel in the future and lead to Dorval&#x27;s closure for redevelopment.

However, the extra traffic never materialized. Mirabel&#x27;s traffic decreased due to the advent in the 1980s of longer-range jets that did not need to refuel in Montreal before crossing the Atlantic Ocean from the major Western North American cities. Montreal&#x27;s economic decline in the late 1970s and 1980s also had a significant effect on both airports&#x27; traffic, which made Mirabel&#x27;s additional capacity redundant. Although this redundancy would have been resolved if Dorval was decommissioned as originally intended, public pressure supported Dorval&#x27;s continued operation due to its closer proximity to downtown Montreal at instead of for Mirabel. Another obstacle of the planned transfer from Dorval to Mirabel was Air Canada&#x27;s desire to keep flights in Dorval with its proximity to AVEOS workshops.

In particular, the simultaneous operation of Mirabel (international flights) and Dorval (continental flights) made Montreal less attractive to international airlines. Passengers who used Montreal in transit had to take long bus rides for connections from domestic to international flights (exacerbated by the partially-completed road links and non-existent rail connecting Mirabel to Montreal), unnecessarily complicating their journeys, while Montrealers grew to resent Mirabel as they were forced to travel far out of town for international flights. Faced with the stark economic reality of operating two Canadian points of entry, most international airlines opted to bypass Montreal altogether in favour of Toronto which enjoyed a single major airport at Pearson handling domestic and international flights. Although Dorval resumed handling international flights in 1997, international airlines were slow to return as they were content having established Toronto Pearson as their eastern Canadian gateway.

===Back to Montréal–Dorval, renaissance===
With all international scheduled flights returning to Montréal–Dorval in 1997, as well as charter flights in 2004, the consolidation of flights to Montréal–Dorval resulted in an increase in passenger traffic. Besides the transfer of flights, Montréal–Dorval International Airport could resume being a true hub for passengers in-transit, and those from continental flights would no longer have to travel to Mirabel to connect to international flights and vice versa. Nonetheless, this was insufficient to woo back international airlines who had already switched their eastern Canadian gateway to Toronto Pearson a decade ago.

Starting as &quot;Dorval Airport&quot;, then &quot;Montréal–Dorval International Airport&quot;, the airport was renamed &quot;Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport&quot; in Trudeau&#x27;s honour on January 1, 2004, by the federal government. The renaming had been announced in September 2003 by then Minister of Transport David Collenette. This move provoked some opposition, especially Quebec sovereigntists opposed to Trudeau&#x27;s staunchly federalist policies. The renaming also provoked opposition from many aviation historians and enthusiasts who recalled Trudeau&#x27;s role in the effort to shutter Dorval in favour of the much larger and modern Mirabel Airport, of which he was the greatest instigator of its construction. Many Montrealers still refer to Trudeau airport as &quot;Dorval,&quot; or &quot;Dorval Airport.&quot;

===Operation Yellow Ribbon===
After the September 11 attacks, Dorval Airport participated in Operation Yellow Ribbon, taking in seven diverted flights that had been bound for the closed airspace over the United States, even though pilots were asked to avoid the airport as a security measure . Mirabel International Airport also took in 10 other diverted flights totaling 17 diverted flight in the Montreal area bound for American cities.

===75th anniversary===
In 2016, Montréal-Trudeau celebrated its 75th anniversary. Under the theme &quot;Service, Destinations, Passion since 1941&quot;, various activities and contests were planned throughout the year. In partnership with the Canada Aviation and Space Museum, the airport hosted the &quot;Travelling Through Time&quot; exhibition in the public hall of the US Departures area. Exhibits showcasing important milestones in the airport&#x27;s history were incorporated throughout the terminal.

==Expansion==
===Terminal expansion (2000–2007)===
Montréal–Trudeau underwent a major expansion and modernization designed to increase the terminal&#x27;s capacity and substantially enhance the level of passenger service. In February 2000, with a budget of CAD 716 million, ADM announced plans for an extensive expansion plan that would bring Montréal–Trudeau up to standard with other North American airports its size. The airport terminal had for the most part remained the same, with the exception of minor renovations, since its opening in 1960. With increased passenger volume resulting from the transfer of international scheduled passengers from Mirabel Airport in 1997, as well as Air Canada&#x27;s intentions to make Montréal–Trudeau its Eastern Canada hub, there was a strong need to greatly expand the terminal, whose capacity of roughly 7 million passengers per year had been exceeded.

The expansion program included the construction of several brand-new facilities, including a jetty for flights to the United States (US Preclearance Terminal), another for other international destinations (International Terminal) and a huge international arrivals complex. An 18-gate Transborder Concourse opened in 2003, an 11-gate International Concourse opened in 2004, new customs hall and baggage claim area for non-domestic flights and an expanded parking garage opened in 2005. Additionally, sections of the domestic area were renovated and expanded in 2007, accompanied with additional retail space. The International part of the Aeroquay satellite was demolished in 2008, leaving the domestic part for regional carriers. The completion of the CAD 716 million expansion gives Montréal–Trudeau the ability to serve 15 million passengers a year. This ironically accomplished one of the goals that was to be met with the construction of Mirabel. (In the 1970s, the federal government projected that 20 million passengers would be passing through Montreal&#x27;s airports annually by 1985, with 17 million through Mirabel). Aéroports de Montréal financed all of these improvements itself, with no government grants. By the end of 2007, CAD 1.5 billion had been spent to upgrade Montréal–Trudeau.

The last round of construction in this phase was to allow the airport to accommodate the Airbus A380. Gate 55, part of the international jetty, was designed for the requirements of the A380. It is equipped with two air bridges to load and unload passengers on both decks of the A380 simultaneously. With Phase II of the international jetty expansion now completed, the airport has two additional A380 gates, although there are currently no airlines operating this type of aircraft at the airport.

===New hotel, transborder terminal expansion and modernization (2006–2009)===
On June 15, 2006, construction began on a new four-star Marriott hotel at the airport, above the transborder terminal. Originally scheduled to be completed by September 2008, the 279 first-class room hotel opened its doors on August 19, 2009. Construction was slowed down because of the recession and a collapse in the Transborder market. It contains an underground train station that was planned to eventually connect the airport with downtown Montreal as well as ADM&#x27;s corporate headquarters.

On the same day, Montreal–Trudeau airport opened the doors to the refurbished, expanded, modernized and user-friendly transborder terminal, meeting the industry&#x27;s highest standards. This increased the total area of the terminal from . Furthermore, the terminal is equipped with a new baggage sorting room which allows U.S. customs officers to retrieve luggage for secondary inspection.

===International terminal expansion (2011–2016)===
Air France became the first operator of the type in Montreal on April 22, 2011, when they officially launched their daily A380 service from Paris. A380 service was reduced to 4 weekly flights during summer 2012 and withdrawn in October 2012, due to low demand for business class and a high level of competition, with Air Canada, Air Transat and Corsair also operating Montreal–Paris flights.

In July 2011, James Cherry, the CEO of Aéroports de Montréal, announced the construction of a two-phase expansion of Montréal–Trudeau&#x27;s international terminal. The total cost of the project, now completed, has been around $620 million.

Phase I of this project, which was completed on December 20, 2012, opened a new boarding lounge which can accommodate as many as 420 passengers, along with a new gate, numbered 62. It was officially completed at a cost of $270 million. The new gate can accommodate three Passenger Transfer Vehicles, allowing passengers to be transferred from the terminal to an aircraft parked on a remote stand nearby. When phase II of the expansion began in 2014, this gate was closed to passengers. It was reopened with the inauguration of the extension two years later.

Phase II of the project, which was officially inaugurated on May 10, 2016, and put into service two days after, added six new contact gates for wide-body jets, including two for the Airbus A380, increasing the total number of contact gates from 10 to 16. This expansion holds gates 63 through 68. The area has 20,000 m2 of open spaces, restaurants, shops and a children&#x27;s playground area. It took two years to complete and opened four months ahead of the original schedule for a total cost of $350 million. It was conceived by &quot;Humà Design&quot; and integrates three massive art installations and four vitrines showcasing Montreal&#x27;s museums. The extension of the international jetty was built to alleviate the high level of congestion on the tarmac and in the terminal.
Apart from these expansions, ADM inaugurated in April 2016, a commercial area between gate 52 and 53. This area is called &quot;Haltes gourmandes&quot; (English: gourmet stops) referring to the large number of restaurants located there. The new restaurants are all owned by &quot;SSP Canada Food Service Inc&quot;. They operate 12 locations in the terminal, managing a total of 4000 m2 of terminal area. SSP invested over $200 million throughout 2016 in its airport locations.

===Future projects (2018–2030)===
In January 2016, ADM published a call for tenders on their website regarding the restoration and upgrade of the curtain wall of the main façade on the terminal. This part of the airport is one of the oldest remaining parts of the original terminal.

Also, according to the 2013–2033 master plan from ADM, the following future developments are in the works:

*Increase in the capacity of the passenger curb-side areas
*Development of a network of taxiways in the centre-west portion of the airport to support the development of a new air cargo handling area and an industrial development zone
*Reconfiguration of the international arrivals hall and of the domestic and international departures luggage room
*Extension of the transborder jetty and addition of a remote parking area

On April 30, 2018, a massive new expansion project was unveiled that will last until 2030. The first phase ($2.5 billion) will see the airport&#x27;s multi-level parking lot demolished and rebuilt with a green roof and the Montreal-Trudeau Airport REM station underneath. The drop-off area will be greatly expanded and covered with glass, and a new remote terminal will be built where runway 10/28 used to stand. By 2030, the remote terminal will be connected via future phases to the current terminal building to handle the expected growth. ADM CEO Philippe Rainville stated &quot;the airport&#x27;s growth has been about double the international average in recent years [so the] goal is to meet the growth projections of the airport.&quot;

==Infrastructure==

===Runways===

There are currently two runways in operation at Montréal-Trudeau: two parallel runways aligned in a northeast–southwest direction (06L/24R and 06R/24L.) There was another single runway in an east–west direction (10/28), but it was permanently decommissioned in July 2023. The former runway is now a taxiway and will continue to be used as such.
===Terminal===

Montréal-Trudeau airport consists of one two-storied terminal, divided into four different zones: the public area (departures and arrivals level), the domestic jetty, the international jetty and the transborder jetty. There are two distinct areas in the public part of the airport (departure level); one is dedicated for the check-in of flights within or outside Canada (except U.S.) and the other one is for flights departing for the U.S. Both public areas are equipped with self-service check-in kiosks, a prayer area, shops and cafés. There is free Wi-Fi throughout the airport, luggage trolleys, ATMs and nursing rooms. When passengers arrive at Montréal-Trudeau from an international destination, they are welcomed into a huge and bright arrival complex, before passing through primary customs inspection, then go down one level to the baggage claim area and finally the international arrivals public area. The Aérogalerie program places artworks throughout the airport to showcase the city&#x27;s artistic and cultural history. Works throughout the airport include showcases, illuminated columns, temporary exhibitions in the international arrival complex and permanent collection from various artists from the city.

The airport has eight mobile lounges that are used to shuttle passengers from the terminal to a plane parked at a remote hardstand spot.

====Domestic jetty====
The domestic jetty, which is accessible via security checkpoint A, is divided into two parts: a satellite jetty connected by a tunnel to the main terminal and a wing attached to the main terminal building. The main jetty holds 16 gates: 1 through 12, 15, and 47 through 49. The satellite jetty holds another 10 gates: 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 28, 30, 32 and 34. There are only two boarding bridges located inside the satellite (17 and 21) as the other gates are mostly used for prop aircraft like the Bombardier Dash 8 family. These parts of the airport are the only departure areas remaining that were part of the original terminal.

====International jetty====
The International jetty, also accessible via the security checkpoint A, is dedicated to flights with destinations outside Canada and United States. This jetty holds 18 gates: 50 through 53 and 55 through 68. Gates 53 and 62 are used exclusively for Passenger Transfer Vehicles. In this area, travellers can shop, eat and relax with a wide varieties of boutiques, restaurants, cafés, spa facilities and one of the biggest airport duty-free shops in Canada. At the far end of the jetty, there is a wide open space with a lot of natural lights through floor to ceilings windows and a big skylight in the rooftop. The masterpiece of the jetty is a work of art, called &quot;Veil of Glass&quot;, composed of different coloured glass triangles illuminated by spotlights, created by local artist &quot;ATOMIC3&quot;. Several murals and other works of art are also located in this jetty, including four from various Montréal museums.

In the international jetty, there is a large area where passengers can relax before their flight. Travelers are able to download to their smartphone or e-reader the first chapter of any books available on the platform &quot;Lire vous transporte&quot;. After that, they can choose to buy the entire book through the Wi-Fi network in the airport. A rest area has been constructed near gate 57 in order to read these books in a calm environment, with cushions and dimmed lights. There are over 1000 chairs with charging stations and USB ports throughout the jetty as well as three water bottle-filling stations.

====Transborder jetty====
The transborder jetty is dedicated to all U.S. bound flights, and has 18 gates: 72 through 89. For access to gate 87, 88 or 89, passengers must go down one level via an escalator. Gate 56, 58 and 60 (part of the international jetty) can also be used for U.S. bound flights. They can be isolated from the other gates by moving glass walls known as &quot;swing gates&quot;. Unlike other jetties, the transborder jetty requires passengers to go through security checkpoint C and then the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and lastly through the duty-free shop before accessing their gates. The gate area contains the same services as the other parts of the airport such as shops, restaurants, rest zones and cafés. If needed, some gates can be isolated in order to offer additional security checkpoints if an aircraft flies to a potential risk zone like Washington–National.

===Airport lounges===
Two major airline alliances (SkyTeam and Star Alliance) are present at Montréal-Trudeau, and therefore both maintain frequent flyer lounges within the airport. There are also three &quot;Pay-In&quot; lounges open for use by all passengers, regardless of airline, frequent flyer status or class of travel.

*Air Canada Maple Leaf Lounge (Star Alliance)
**Domestic - Gate 5
**International - Gate 52
**USA Transborder - Gate 73
*Air France KLM Lounge (SkyTeam)
**International - Gate 57
*Desjardins Odyssey Lounge
**International - Gate 63
*Desjardins Odyssey Lounge – Plaza Premium Lounge
**USA Transborder - Gate 76
*National Bank Lounge

==Airlines and destinations==

===Passenger===



==Statistics==

===Annual traffic===

: At Montréal–Trudeau and at other airports in Canada with United States border preclearance, a distinction is made between &quot;transborder&quot; and &quot;international&quot; flights for operational and statistical purposes. A &quot;transborder&quot; flight is a flight between Canada and a destination in the United States, while an &quot;international&quot; flight is a flight between Canada and a destination that is not within the United States or Canada. A &quot;domestic&quot; flight is a flight within Canada only.

: During 2020 &amp; 2021, there was a significant decrease of passenger numbers due to the COVID-19 global pandemic and Canada border closures and/or restrictions.

==Ground transportation==
===Public transit===
Montréal–Trudeau is accessible by six bus routes operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM): one dedicated airport transfer service, one express route, two regular daytime routes, and two night buses. 

Introduced on March 29, 2010, the 747 Montreal-Trudeau/Downtown route operates for 24 hours every day of the year, connecting the airport to Lionel-Groulx metro station, Central Station, Berri-UQAM metro station, and the city center. Prior to the introduction of the 747 bus service, Groupe La Québécoise operated a coach service known as L&#x27;Aerobus between the airport and Central Station, connecting with several hotels downtown.

In addition to the 747, Montréal–Trudeau is accessible by the 204 Cardinal and 209 Des Sources everyday, while the 356 Lachine/YUL Aéroport/Des Sources and 378 Sauvé/YUL Aéroport serve the airport during night service hours. It is also accessible by the 460 Express Métropolitaine, which runs during rush hours. These routes provide service to the Dorval bus terminus and train station, which is within walking distance of Via&#x27;s Dorval station.

===Intercity rail connections===
Connection to Via Rail, the national train operator in Canada, is possible through an airport shuttle bus to Dorval station located to the south of the airport. It is the nearest station on the Québec City-Windsor Corridor and offers inter-city rail connections to Quebec City, Ottawa, Kingston and Toronto as well as smaller regional centres in Quebec and Ontario. Via does not provide local service between Dorval and Montreal Central Station.

The shuttle bus from Montréal–Trudeau International Airport to Dorval station is free of charge to Via Rail passengers. Operated by indigo, the service departs from departures door 8 every 45-60 minutes during the stations opening hours, taking around 5 minutes to reach its destination.

===Intercity bus===
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines operates a bus from Trudeau Airport to Ottawa Railway Station only for Air France-KLM customers originating in/arriving in the Ottawa area. Air-France KLM has three daily bus services between those cities.

Air France also operates a bus from Trudeau to Sainte-Foy in Quebec City for its customers.

Swiss International Air Lines previously operated its Swissbus service from Trudeau to Ottawa Railway Station for Swiss customers.

Orléans Express offers service from Ottawa, Gatineau, Drummondville, and Quebec City.

===Car===
The airport is accessible from Highway 20 or from Highway 520, a spur off Highway 40 that leads directly towards the airport. Eastbound Highway 20 leads to the Dorval interchange, the exit which drivers must take for the airport. From the north, Côte-Vertu Boulevard that runs parallel to runways 24L and 24R provides access to the Air Canada Base and hangars, Air Transat hangars, Air Inuit hangars, Bombardier Aerospace assembly facility and the deicing facility.

When drivers pick up or drop off guests at Trudeau, they are permitted to stop momentarily outside the Arrivals and Departure areas at both the Canada and International departures as well as the Transborder Jetty.

Aéroports de Montréal, the City of Montreal, Transports Québec and Transport Canada made plans to improve the Dorval interchange and built direct road links between the airport and highways 20 and 520. Once the certificate of authorization was obtained, work began in June 2009 with an original projected end date of 2017, although some parts of the project will be on hold for several years. The project entails redesigning the road network within the airport site, which was mostly completed as planned.

===Future connections===

On April 22, 2016, the CEO of the Caisse de Dépot et de Placement du Québec Michael Sabia and Montreal mayor Denis Coderre announced a massive transit project called Réseau express métropolitain, slated to open between 2023 and 2027. This planned rapid transit network will connect the Trudeau Airport to the Central station in Downtown Montréal, the North Shore, the South Shore and the West Island. It will run from 5am to 1am, 7 days a week. Construction began in April 2018 and will connect Trudeau Airport with downtown by 2027.

==Incidents and accidents==

* November 29, 1963 – Trans-Canada Air Lines Flight 831 crashed shortly after departure for Toronto International Airport, killing all 118 people on board the Douglas DC-8 jet.
*On June 18, 1998, Propair Flight 420 suffered from brake dragging on departure from Trudeau Airport (then known as Montreal Dorval Airport). This heated up the wheel brakes of the Fairchild Metroliner, which eventually became lit by hydraulic fluid, starting a fire in the left wing. The aircraft attempted to divert to Mirabel International Airport. However, the left wing suffered a structural failure due to the extreme flames, and the aircraft rolled and hit the ground upside down, killing all 11 people on the flight.
* June 5, 2015 – WestJet flight 588 from Toronto Pearson International Airport, operated by a Boeing 737-600 (Registration C GWCT) slid off the runway while landing. There were no fatalities or injuries among the passengers and crew.
* July 9, 2023 – Air Canada Flight 885, a B777-300ER from Geneva International Airport (Registration C-FITL) was standing at the gate when a water truck caught fire under the tail section. As passengers began disembarking, the water service truck located near the rear cargo door caught fire. The flames reached the aircraft&#x27;s skin and smoke was detected in the cabin. A rapid deboarding was ordered, and all passengers exited to the terminal while the fire was brought under control by emergency services. No injuries were reported.

==Tenants==

Jet Fuel A, A-1 and 100DLL are available from various FBOs at Dorval.

<text>The OVRA, unofficially known as the Organization for Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Fascism (), was the secret police of the Kingdom of Italy during the reign of King Victor Emmanuel III. It was founded in 1927 under the regime of Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. The OVRA was the Italian precursor of Nazi Germany&#x27;s secret police. Mussolini&#x27;s secret police were assigned to stop any anti-fascist activity or sentiment. Approximately 50,000 OVRA agents infiltrated most aspects of domestic life in Italy. The OVRA, headed by Arturo Bocchini, never appeared in any official document, so the official name of the organization still remains unclear.

== Origin ==
In the aftermath of the attempted assassination of Mussolini by the young Anteo Zamboni, in Bologna on 31 October 1926, a swath of repressive legislation was swiftly enacted by the Italian government. All political parties, associations, and organizations opposed to Fascist Italy were dissolved, and everybody who was proven to have &quot;committed or expressed intention to commit actions directed to violently subvert the social, economic or national order or undermine national security or to oppose or obstruct the actions of the government&quot; could be sent into exile in remote locations by the police.

On 25 November 1926, the new &quot;Legge di Difesa dello Stato&quot; (State Defense Law) instituted a &quot;Tribunale Speciale&quot; (Special Court) to try those who were accused of being &quot;enemies of the state&quot;, and sentence them to harsh prison terms or even to death, as the death penalty had also been restored under the new law. Priority was given to the reorganization of the National Police Force, known as &quot;Pubblica Sicurezza&quot; (PS), under career police officer Arturo Bocchini. The new Code of Laws concerning Public Security (&quot;Testo Unico delle Leggi di Pubblica Sicurezza&quot;, TULPS) enacted in 1926 and revised in 1931, specified a &quot;Department of Political Police&quot; as a special division of the force with the aim of controlling and preventing political dissent. Later, this division came to be known as OVRA, although its existence remained secret until December 1930 when the official press agency Agenzia Stefani released a statement quoting the OVRA as a &quot;special section&quot; of the police force.

== Keeping the fascist regime in power ==
Bocchini appointed inspector Francesco Nudi as head of the OVRA. Nudi was later replaced by Guido Leto. The OVRA compiled files on around 130,000 potential subversives with the aid of a network of approximately 100,000 informants, and by 1930 they were organising around 20,000 raids each week. It is believed that about 6,000 of the people arrested by the OVRA, mainly communists and members of the Giustizia e Libertà, were either tried by the Tribunale Speciale or sent into exile on remote Mediterranean islands. The conditions in these places were extremely poor, so many anti-fascists simply left Italy for their own safety.

It is known that Heinrich Himmler met with Bocchini repeatedly and modeled the organization of Nazi Germany&#x27;s secret police on that of the OVRA. A secret protocol was signed on 2 April 1936 by the heads of the two police organizations to further cooperation and collaboration. One of the chief duties of the OVRA was to operate and maintain the (CPC), a special archive where all personal information about known &quot;subversives&quot; was dutifully compiled to create a &quot;personal profile&quot; containing all data concerning the subject&#x27;s education, culture, and habits, down to minute details about personal character and sexual orientation.

=== Spying on the Vatican ===
A major duty for the OVRA was spying on Pope Pius XI, as the Roman Catholic Church was an extremely powerful institution in Italian life that the fascist regime never controlled, instead having a partnership with. It was a common practice of the OVRA to catch Roman Catholic priests &quot;in flagrante delicto&quot; and blackmail them into spying for the OVRA, which was therefore always very well informed about the affairs of the Holy See. The American historian David Kertzer described the OVRA&#x27;s spy network within the Vatican as &quot;robust&quot;, comprising four highly placed clerics and a number of lay Vatican employees. Mussolini was fascinated by reports of homosexual activity among senior Catholic clerics and always had them sent to his office for him to read.

The OVRA had a very long file on the Pope&#x27;s Master of Ceremonials, his close friend Monsignor Camillo Caccia Dominioni. He was known to sexually molest young boys, despite the Pope being aware of this, at least from 1926 on. Another homosexual cleric was Monsignor Ricardo Sanz de Samper, the Prefect of the Pope&#x27;s Household and papal majordomo, whose fondness for sex with young boys became so open that even Pius was forced to dismiss him in 1928. Another long OVRA file was on the Jesuit Father Pietro Tacchi Venturi, the Pope&#x27;s emissary to Mussolini, who often had &quot;illicit&quot; relations with young men and had been wounded in a lover&#x27;s quarrel, which he tried to pass off as an anti-fascist assassination attempt. The Pope retained Venturi as his preferred liaison with Mussolini, despite this obvious fabrication. Another senior cleric blackmailed by the OVRA was Monsignor Enrico Pucci, the chief of the Vatican press department, who worked as an informer for the OVRA from October 1927 onward. Pucci as a rule did not see the Pope very often. However, he met on a daily basis with the Pope&#x27;s advisers, to get directions for the editorial stance of the Vatican media. This provided the OVRA with much information. One of the most important informers in the Vatican remains anonymous. His OVRA file simply describes him as the &quot;noted Vatican informer&quot;. Kertzer wrote that judging from the high-quality intelligence he provided, the &quot;noted Vatican informer&quot; must have been someone very senior, so that his name was never written down.

== During the Second World War ==
During World War II, the OVRA was used by Mussolini to control resistance groups in the Balkans (Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s National Liberation Army especially) prior to the 1943 armistice of Cassibile and withdrawal. In 1943, with the Allied invasion of Italy starting the Italian campaign, the OVRA began to recruit double agents to infiltrate the British Special Operations Executives; these efforts failed to stop Mussolini&#x27;s ouster. With the establishment of the Italian Social Republic in Northern Italy, many OVRA agents flocked to this state led by Mussolini, fighting until Mussolini was executed by Italian partisans on 28 April 1945. OVRA agents were favourite targets of communist partisans, as they were a symbol of the fascist government.

== Legacy ==
After the war ended, the OVRA was officially disbanded. A decree issued on 26 April 1945 stated that the CPC should be maintained and &quot;updated with all the information pertaining to anybody whose political activity is aimed at breaking the laws and regulations enacted by the democratic Government against neo-Fascism, anarchists who are by definition against any law and government, and political activists whose moral depravity and contempt of law could prompt them to instigate unrest or commit acts of terrorism&quot;. Later, a division of the PS named &quot;Servizio Informazioni Speciali&quot; (Special Informations Service, better known as SIS) was set up by the new Minister of Interior, the Italian Socialist Party member Giuseppe Romita, as a result of a new reorganization of the Police offices, with the task of taking over the management of the CPC and investigating politically motivated crimes and other felonies related to that particular time (such as black marketeering, etc.), and that many of the former officers of the OVRA were being reinstated as members of the new SIS. Even the person appointed as head of SIS was Inspector General Santoro, one of Leto&#x27;s former deputies. Most of the laws and regulations of the old TULPS of 1931 were kept in force by the Italian Republic, and Leto was later reinstated as a fully fledged national Police officer, and entrusted with the supervision and coordination of police academies in post-war Italy.

==Cultural Depiction==
The organization was depicted in the Japanese animated film &quot;Porco Rosso&quot;.

<text>Jacques Martin Barzun (; November 30, 1907 – October 25, 2012) was a French-born American historian known for his studies of the history of ideas and cultural history. He wrote about a wide range of subjects, including baseball, mystery novels, and classical music, and was also known as a philosopher of education. In the book &quot;Teacher in America&quot; (1945), Barzun influenced the training of schoolteachers in the United States.

A professor of history at Columbia College for many years, he published more than forty books, was awarded the American Presidential Medal of Freedom, and was designated a knight of the French Legion of Honor. The historical retrospective &quot;From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life, 1500 to the Present&quot; (2000), widely considered his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, was published when he was 93 years old.

==Life==
Jacques Martin Barzun was born in Créteil, France, to and Anna-Rose Barzun, and spent his childhood in Paris and Grenoble. His father was a member of the Abbaye de Créteil group of artists and writers, and also worked in the French Ministry of Labor. His parents&#x27; Paris home was frequented by many modernist artists of &quot;Belle Époque&quot; France, such as the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, the Cubist painters Albert Gleizes and Marcel Duchamp, the composer Edgard Varèse, and the writers Richard Aldington and Stefan Zweig.

While on a diplomatic mission to the United States during the First World War (1914–1918), Barzun&#x27;s father so liked the country he decided that his son should receive an American university education; thus, the twelve-year-old Jacques Martin attended Lycée Janson-de-Sailly until moving to America, where he graduated from Harrisburg Technical High School in 1923 and then went off to Columbia University, where he obtained a liberal arts education.

As an undergraduate at Columbia College, Barzun was drama critic for the &quot;Columbia Daily Spectator&quot;, a prize-winning president of the Philolexian Society, the Columbia literary and debate club, and valedictorian of the class of 1927. He obtained a master&#x27;s degree in 1928 and a Ph.D. in 1932 from Columbia, and taught history there from 1928 to 1955, becoming the Seth Low Professor of History and a founder of the discipline of cultural history. For years, he and literary critic Lionel Trilling conducted Columbia&#x27;s famous Great Books course. He was elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1954 and a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1984.

From 1955 to 1968, he served as Dean of the Graduate School, Dean of Faculties, and Provost, while also being an Extraordinary Fellow of Churchill College at the University of Cambridge. From 1968 until his 1975 retirement, he was University Professor at Columbia. From 1951 to 1963 Barzun was one of the managing editors of The Readers&#x27; Subscription Book Club, and its successor the Mid-Century Book Society (the other managing editors being W. H. Auden and Lionel Trilling), and afterwards was Literary Adviser to Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons, 1975 to 1993.

In 1936, Barzun married Mariana Lowell, a violinist from a prominent Boston family. They had three children: James, Roger, and Isabel. Mariana died in 1979. In 1980, Barzun married Marguerite Lee Davenport. From 1996 the Barzuns lived in her hometown, San Antonio, Texas. His granddaughter Lucy Barzun Donnelly was a producer of the award-winning HBO film &quot;Grey Gardens&quot;. His grandson, Matthew Barzun, is a businessman who served from 2009 to 2011 as the U.S. Ambassador to Sweden, and from 2013 to 2017 as Ambassador to the United Kingdom. On May 14, 2012, Jacques Barzun attended a symphony performance in his honor at which works by his favorite composer, Hector Berlioz, were performed. He attended in a wheelchair and delivered a brief address to the crowd.

Barzun died at his home in San Antonio, Texas on October 25, 2012, aged 104. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which compared him with such scholars as Sidney Hook, Daniel Bell, and Lionel Trilling, called him a &quot;distinguished historian, essayist, cultural gadfly and educator who helped establish the modern discipline of cultural history&quot;. Naming Edward Gibbon, Jacob Burckhardt and Thomas Babington Macaulay as his intellectual ancestors, and calling him &quot;one of the West&#x27;s most eminent historians of culture&quot; and &quot;a champion of the liberal arts tradition in higher education,&quot; who &quot;deplored what he called the &#x27;gangrene of specialism&#x27;&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; remarked, &quot;The sheer scope of his knowledge was extraordinary. Barzun&#x27;s eye roamed over the full spectrum of Western music, art, literature and philosophy.&quot; Essayist Joseph Epstein, remembering him in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; as a &quot;flawless and magisterial&quot; writer who tackled &quot;Darwin, Marx, Wagner, Berlioz, William James, French verse, English prose composition, university teaching, detective fiction, [and] the state of intellectual life&quot;, described Barzun as a tall, handsome man with an understated elegance, thoroughly Americanized, but retaining an air of old-world culture, cosmopolitan in an elegant way rare for intellectuals&quot;.

==Career==
Over seven decades, Barzun wrote and edited more than forty books touching on an unusually broad range of subjects, including science and medicine, psychiatry from Robert Burton through William James to modern methods, and art, and classical music; he was one of the all-time authorities on Hector Berlioz. Some of his books—particularly &quot;Teacher in America&quot; and &quot;The House of Intellect&quot;—enjoyed a substantial lay readership and influenced debate about culture and education far beyond the realm of academic history. Barzun had a strong interest in the tools and mechanics of writing and research. He undertook the task of completing, from a manuscript almost two-thirds of which was in first draft at the author&#x27;s death, and editing (with the help of six other people), the first edition (published 1966) of &quot;Follett&#x27;s Modern American Usage&quot;. Barzun was also the author of books on literary style (&quot;Simple and Direct&quot;, 1975), on the crafts of editing and publishing (&quot;On Writing, Editing, and Publishing&quot;, 1971), and on research methods in history and the other humanities (&quot;The Modern Researcher&quot;, which has seen at least six editions, and is one of the thousand most widely held library items according to the OCLC).

Barzun did not disdain popular culture: his varied interests included detective fiction and baseball. His widely quoted statement, &quot;Whoever wants to know the heart and mind of America had better learn baseball.&quot; was inscribed on a plaque at the Baseball Hall of Fame. He edited and wrote the introduction to the 1961 anthology, &quot;The Delights of Detection&quot;, which included stories by G. K. Chesterton, Dorothy L. Sayers, Rex Stout, and others. In 1971, Barzun co-authored (with Wendell Hertig Taylor), &quot;A Catalogue of Crime: Being a Reader&#x27;s Guide to the Literature of Mystery, Detection, &amp; Related Genres&quot;, for which he and his co-author received a Special Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America the following year. Barzun was also an advocate
of supernatural fiction, and wrote the introduction to &quot;The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural&quot;. Barzun was a proponent of the theatre critic and diarist James Agate, whom he compared in stature to Samuel Pepys. Barzun edited Agate&#x27;s last two diaries into a new edition in 1951 and wrote an informative introductory essay, &quot;Agate and His Nine Egos&quot;.
Jacques Barzun continued to write on education and cultural history after retiring from Columbia. At 84 years of age, he began writing his swan song, to which he devoted the better part of the 1990s. The resulting book of more than 800 pages, &quot;From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life, 1500 to the Present&quot;, revealed a vast erudition and brilliance undimmed by advanced age. Historians, literary critics, and popular reviewers all lauded &quot;From Dawn to Decadence&quot; as a sweeping and powerful survey of modern Western history, and it became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. With this work he gained an international reputation. Reviewing it in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, historian William Everdell called the book &quot;a great achievement&quot; by a scholar &quot;undiminished in his scholarship, research and polymathic interests,&quot; while also scrutinizing Barzun&#x27;s scant treatment of figures like Walt Whitman and Karl Marx.
The book introduces several novel typographic devices that aid an unusually rich system of cross-referencing and help keep many strands of thought in the book under organized control. Most pages feature a sidebar containing a pithy quotation, usually little known, and often surprising or humorous, from some author or historical figure. In 2007, Barzun commented that &quot;Old age is like learning a new profession. And not one of your own choosing.&quot; As late as October 2011, one month before his 104th birthday, he reviewed Adam Kirsch&#x27;s &quot;Why Trilling Matters&quot; for the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;.

In his philosophy of writing history, Barzun emphasized the role of storytelling over the use of academic jargon and detached analysis. He concluded in &quot;From Dawn to Decadence&quot; that &quot;history cannot be a science; it is the very opposite, in that its interest resides in the particulars&quot;.

==Recognition==
In 1968, Barzun received the St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates. Barzun was appointed a Chevalier of the National Order of the Legion of Honour. In 2003, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush.

In 1993, his book &quot;An Essay on French Verse: For Readers of English Poetry&quot; won the Poetry Society of America&#x27;s Melville Cane Poetry Award.

On October 18, 2007, he received the 59th Great Teacher Award of the Society of Columbia Graduates &quot;in absentia&quot;.

On March 2, 2011, Barzun was awarded the 2010 National Humanities Medal by President Barack Obama, although he was not expected to be in attendance. On April 16, 2011, he received the Philolexian Award for Distinguished Literary Achievement &quot;in absentia&quot;.

The American Philosophical Society honors Barzun with its Jacques Barzun Prize in Cultural History, awarded annually since 1993 to the author of a recent distinguished work of cultural history. He also received the gold medal for Criticism from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, of which he was twice president.

<doc id="263616" wikidata="Q875749" url="?curid=263616" title="Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport">
<text>Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport — also less commonly known as Wold–Chamberlain Field — is a joint civil-military public international airport serving the Twin Cities in the U.S. state of Minnesota. It is located in Fort Snelling Unorganized Territory. Although situated within the unorganized territory, the airport is centrally located within of both downtown Minneapolis and downtown Saint Paul. In addition to primarily hosting commercial flights from major American and some international airlines, the airport is also home to several United States Air Force and Minnesota Air National Guard operations. The airport is also used by a variety of air cargo operators. MSP is the busiest airport in the Upper Midwest.

A joint civil-military airport, MSP is home to the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport Joint Air Reserve Station, supporting both Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard flight operations. Units stationed there include the 934th Airlift Wing (934 AW). The airport is located in Fort Snelling Unorganized Territory. Although sections of the airport border the city limits of Minneapolis and Richfield the airport property is not part of any city or school district. MSP covers 2,930 acres (1,186 ha) of land. The airport generates an estimated $15.9 billion a year for the Twin Cities&#x27; economy and supports 87,000 workers.

MSP is a major hub for Delta Air Lines. It also serves as the home airport for Minnesota-based Sun Country Airlines and Endeavor Air, a Delta subsidiary. Delta Air Lines and its regional affiliates account for about 70% of the airport&#x27;s passenger traffic. The airport is operated by the Metropolitan Airports Commission, which also handles the operation of six smaller airports in the region.

==History==
What is now known as Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport started in 1919 as Speedway Field when several local groups came together to take control of the former bankrupt Twin City Speedway race track. The first hangar was a wooden structure, constructed in 1920 for airmail services. The Minneapolis Park Board took possession of Speedway Field on June 1, 1928, and in 1929, passenger services began. In 1923, the airport was renamed &quot;Wold–Chamberlain Field&quot; for the World War I pilots Ernest Groves Wold and Cyrus Foss Chamberlain. In 1944 the site was renamed to &quot;Minneapolis–St. Paul Metropolitan Airport/Wold-Chamberlain Field&quot;, with &quot;International&quot; replacing &quot;Metropolitan&quot; four years later. Today it is rare to see the Wold–Chamberlain portion of the name used anywhere.

===Expansions===
Ground was broken for the current Terminal 1 building on October 26, 1958. The US $8.5 million, 600,000 square foot (56,000 m2) terminal with 24 gates on two concourses was designed by Lyle George Landstrom. who worked for Cerny Associates. The terminal, then referred to as the New Terminal, was completed on January 13, 1962, and operations began on January 21. Pier D (formerly the Gold Concourse, now Concourse G) was completed in 1971 and Pier A (formerly the Green Concourse, now Concourse C) was completed in 1972 as part of an expansion of the terminal designed by Cerny Associates. This project also involved rebuilding the existing concourses into bi-level structures equipped with holding rooms and jet bridges. The Gold Concourse was expanded in 1986 and included the airport&#x27;s first moving walkway. Concourses A and B opened on June 1, 2002, as part of a $250 million terminal expansion designed by Minneapolis-based Architectural Alliance. The final component of the project included a $17.5 million extension of Concourse C consisting of six additional gates, which opened on October 31, 2002.

Terminal 2 was first built in 1986 and then rebuilt in 2001. It is used mostly for charter and low cost airlines, including Minnesota-based Sun Country and Southwest, but is also used for Condor, Icelandair and JetBlue. The terminal has since been expanded and has a total of 14 gates. The colored labeling system for concourses in both terminals was replaced beginning in 2000 with the current system of lettered concourses.

===Recent history===
Due in part to aircraft noise in south Minneapolis, the Highland Park neighborhood in St. Paul, and surrounding suburbs, proposals were made in the 1990s to build a new airport on the fringes of the Twin Cities metro in Dakota County to handle larger jets and more international traffic. Minneapolis, St. Paul, and other neighboring cities were concerned that such a move would have a negative economic impact, so an arrangement was made where the Metropolitan Airports Commission would outfit many homes in the vicinity of the airport with sound insulation and air conditioning so that indoor noise could be reduced. A citizen group named ROAR (Residents Opposed to Airport Racket) was created in 1998 and helped push the MAC to make these concessions. Later, in 2004, the MAC voted to reduce funding for the soundproofing projects, saying in part that the economic climate had turned in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Minneapolis Mayor R. T. Rybak, who had been a founding member of ROAR, promised that the city would challenge the changes. In 2005, the cities of Minneapolis, Eagan, and Richfield and the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority filed a lawsuit against the MAC, which was settled with a Consent Decree in 2007. The terms in the Consent Decree specified levels of sound insulation for homes within a fixed boundary of projected aircraft noise exposure around MSP. Upon the completion of the noise mitigation program in 2014, more than 15,000 single-family homes and 3,303 multi-family units around MSP were provided noise mitigation at cost of $95 million.

A 2022 J.D. Power survey concluded that with ranking the largest US and Canadian airports on a 1,000 point scale based on traveler satisfaction, the airport received a score of 800, ranking it the best airport in the US and Canada. MSP&#x27;s high ranking was accredited to its recently updated facilities.

In 2023, Minneapolis-Saint Paul was recognized by analytics company Cirium as the world&#x27;s most punctual international airport, having on-time departure and arrival rates of 84.44% and 84.62% respectively.

==Facilities==
===Terminals===
Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport has two terminals with a total of 131 gates.

*Terminal 1 (Lindbergh) contains 117 gates across seven concourses, lettered A–G.
*Terminal 2 (Humphrey) contains 14 gates across one concourse, lettered H.

International arrivals are processed in Concourse G in Terminal 1, and in Terminal 2.

The two terminals are located about apart and accessed from separate exits of Minnesota State Highway 5. The arrangement can be confusing for some drivers, as the terminals are not connected within the airport facilities, meaning that taking the wrong exit can cause a delay of several minutes, and require the use of lightrail public transit or the roadway to travel between terminals. In 2010, signage along Highway 5 was updated to make it more clear which airlines serve each terminal.

Terminal 1 is named after aviator Charles Lindbergh, who was raised in Minnesota and Terminal 2 is named after vice president Hubert Humphrey, who also had represented Minnesota in Congress.

===Ground transportation===
The terminal buildings are directly located off of Minnesota State Highway 5. Several other major highways that border the airport are Minnesota State Highway 62, Minnesota State Highway 77, and Interstate 494.

Metro Transit, the region&#x27;s public transportation provider, operates the Blue Line, a light rail route, on the airport grounds. Travelers can use the line to connect between the two terminals. No fare is charged for passengers only travelling between Terminal 1 and 2, and service between the terminals operates all day (the rest of the line shuts down for about four hours overnight). Beyond the airport, the Blue Line travels to downtown Minneapolis and the Mall of America in nearby Bloomington. Metro Transit also operates bus route 54 to St. Paul.

===Military facilities===
The Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport Joint Air Reserve Station at MSP is home to the 934th Airlift Wing (934 AW), an Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) unit and the 133d Airlift Wing (133 AW) of the Minnesota Air National Guard. Both units fly the C-130 Hercules and are operationally-gained by the Air Mobility Command (AMC). The 934th consists of over 1,300 military personnel, of whom approximately 250 are full-time Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) and Air Reserve Technician (ART) personnel. The 133rd is similarly manned, making for a total military presence of over 2,600 full-time and part-time personnel.

The 934 AW serves as the &quot;host&quot; wing for the installation, which also includes lodging/billeting, officers club, Base Exchange (BX) and other morale, welfare and recreation (MWR) facilities for active, reserve/national guard and retired military personnel and their families.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On March 7, 1950, Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 307, a Martin 2-0-2 diverted from Rochester International Airport crashed 5 km northwest of MSP after first hitting a 70 foot high flagpole with its left wing on final approach, 8/10 of a mile from the touchdown point, in blinding snow. The left wing eventually detached and the aircraft dived and crashed into a house. All 13 passengers and crew and two children in the house were killed. A loss of visual reference to the ground on approach was the probable cause. 
* On May 10, 2005, Northwest Flight 1495, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9, suffered a valve fracture and lost hydraulic pressure in its right engine shortly after takeoff from John Glenn Columbus International Airport en route to MSP. The aircraft performed a successful emergency landing at MSP, but began experiencing steering problems and a loss of the brakes while taxing to the gate, resulting in it colliding with the wing of an Airbus A319-114 at approximately 16 mph. Eight injuries were reported among the crew and passengers of both planes and the ground crew.

<doc id="263622" wikidata="Q57385" url="?curid=263622" title="Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo">
<text>Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo (; born 5 June 1942) is an Equatoguinean politician, former military officer and dictator who has served as the second president of Equatorial Guinea since 1982. Previously, he was the Chairman of the Supreme Military Council from 1979 to 1982. As of 2025, he is the second longest consecutively serving current non-royal national leader in the world.

After graduating from military school in Zaragoza, Spain, Obiang held multiple positions under the presidency of his uncle, Francisco Macías Nguema, including director of the notorious Black Beach prison. He ousted Macías in a military coup in 1979 and took control of the country as president and chairman of the Supreme Military Council. After the country&#x27;s nominal return to civilian rule in 1982, he founded the Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea (PDGE) in 1987, which was the country&#x27;s sole legal party until 1992. He has overseen Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s emergence as an important oil producer, beginning in the 1990s. Obiang was Chairperson of the African Union from 2011 to 2012.

Obiang is regarded as an authoritarian leader. He has been widely accused of corruption and abuse of power. Under his rule, Equatorial Guinea continues to have one of the worst human rights records in the world. In marked contrast to the trend toward democracy in most of Africa, Equatorial Guinea is currently a dominant-party state, in which Obiang&#x27;s PDGE holds virtually all governing power in the nation and has held all or almost all seats in the legislature since its creation. The constitution provides Obiang sweeping powers, including the right to rule by decree, effectively making his government a legal dictatorship. He has also placed family members in key government positions.

==Early life==
From a family of the Esangui ethnic clan, Obiang was born on 5 June 1942 in the town of Akoacám (Mongomo district, Wele-Nzas province), belonging to the colony of Spanish Guinea, on the current border with Gabon, within the Continental Equatorial Guinea. Son of the Gabonese Santiago Nguema Eneme Obama and María Mbasogo Ngui, he was the third of ten brothers, among whom are also the National Security Delegate Armengol Ondo Nguema and former National Defense Minister . Obiang&#x27;s parents emigrated from Gabon to avoid paying capitation taxes and take advantage of the good economic situation in Spanish Guinea. After the death of María Mbasogo Ngui, Obiang and his brothers were raised by his father and his new wife Carmen Mikue Mbira.

Obiang completed his first studies at the Cardenal Cisneros School Group in Ebibeyin and at the La Salle Center in Bata (now the Enrique Nvo Okenve National College), where he obtained a degree in labor administration.

Obiang joined the Colonial Guard during Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s colonial period and attended the General Military Academy in Zaragoza, Spain. He achieved the rank of lieutenant after his uncle, Francisco Macías Nguema, was elected the country&#x27;s first president. Under Macías, Obiang held various positions, including the governor of Bioko and leader of the National Guard. He was also head of Black Beach Prison, notorious for severely torturing its inmates.

==Presidency==

===Coup and aftermath===

After Macías ordered the murders of several members of the family they shared, including Obiang&#x27;s brother, Obiang and others in Macías&#x27;s inner circle feared the president had become insane. Obiang overthrew his uncle on 3 August 1979 in a bloody &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, and placed him on trial for his actions, including the genocide of the Bubi people, over the previous decade. Macías was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad on 29 September 1979. A new Moroccan presidential guard was required to form the firing squad, because local soldiers feared his alleged magical powers.

Obiang declared that the new government would make a fresh start from Macías&#x27;s brutal and repressive régime. He granted amnesty to political prisoners, and ended the previous régime&#x27;s system of forced labor. He also reversed the previous régime&#x27;s most repressive measures; Obiang unbanned glasses and Christianity, which were previously banned during his uncle&#x27;s régime. However, he made virtually no mention of his own role in the atrocities committed under it.

===New constitution===
The country nominally returned to civilian rule in 1982, with the enactment of a slightly less authoritarian constitution. At the same time, Obiang was elected to a seven-year term as president; he was the only candidate. He was sworn in on 12 October, the 14th anniversary of the country&#x27;s independence from Spain. He was reelected in 1989, again as the only candidate. After other parties were nominally allowed to organize in 1992, he was reelected in 1996 and 2002 with 98 percent of the vote in elections condemned as fraudulent by international observers. In 2002, for instance, at least one voting district was recorded as giving Obiang 103 percent of the vote.

He was reelected for a fourth term in 2009 with 97% of the vote, again amid accusations of voter fraud and intimidation, beating opposition leader Plácido Micó Abogo.

Obiang&#x27;s rule is considered more humane and less authoritarian and corrupt than that of his uncle. By some accounts, however, it has become increasingly brutal, and has bucked the larger trend toward greater democracy in Africa. According to most domestic and international observers, he leads one of the most corrupt, ethnocentric and repressive regimes in the world. Equatorial Guinea is essentially a one-party state dominated by Obiang&#x27;s Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea (PDGE). The constitution grants Obiang sweeping powers, including the power to rule by decree.

Although opposition parties were legalized in 1992, the legislature remains dominated by the PDGE, and there is no substantive opposition to executive decisions. There have never been more than eight opposition deputies in the lower house, while the PDGE has held every seat in the Senate since its inception in 2013. For all intents and purposes, Obiang holds all governing power in the nation.

The opposition is barely tolerated; indeed, a 2006 article in &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; quoted Obiang as asking, &quot;What right does the opposition have to criticize the actions of a government?&quot; The opposition is severely hampered by the lack of a free press as a vehicle for their views. There are no newspapers and all broadcast media are either owned outright by the government or controlled by its allies.

===Relations with the United States and other nations===

Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s relations with the United States cooled in 1993, after Ambassador John E. Bennett was accused of practicing witchcraft at the graves of 10 British airmen who were killed when their plane crashed there during World War II. Bennett left after receiving a death threat at the U.S. Embassy in Malabo in 1994. In his farewell address, he publicly named the government&#x27;s most notorious torturers, including Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s Minister of National Security, Manuel Nguema Mba, another Obiang uncle. No new envoy was appointed, and the embassy was closed in 1996, leaving its affairs to be handled by the embassy in neighboring Cameroon.

Things turned around for the Obiang regime after the terrorist attacks in 2001 on New York and Washington, after which the United States re-prioritized its dealings with key African states. On 25 January 2002, the Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies, a neoconservative Israeli-based think tank, sponsored a forum on 15 May 2006. Speaking at the IASPS forum, Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Walter H. Kansteiner said, &quot;African oil is of national strategic interest to us, and it will increase and become more important as we move forward.&quot;
In a lengthy state visit from March to April 2006, President Obiang sought to reopen the closed embassy in the US, saying that &quot;the lack of a U.S. diplomatic presence is definitely holding back economic growth.&quot; President Obiang was warmly greeted by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who called him a &quot;good friend&quot;. 
Public relations company Cassidy &amp; Associates may have been partially responsible for the change in tone between Obiang and the United States government. Since 2004, Cassidy had been employed by the dictator&#x27;s government at a rate of at least $120,000 a month.

By October 2006, however, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had raised concerns about the proposal to build the new embassy on land owned by Obiang, whom the United Nations Commission on Human Rights accused of directly overseeing the torture of opponents. The new embassy chancery opened in 2013.

Cameroon

Equatorial Guinea has cordial relations with neighbouring Cameroon, although there was criticism in Cameroon in 2000 about perceived mistreatment of Cameroonians working in Equatorial Guinea. Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea have an unresolved maritime border dispute. The majority Fang ethnic group of mainland Equatorial Guinea extends both north and south into the forests of Cameroon and Gabon. Cameroon exports some food products to Equatorial Guinea and imports oil from Equatorial Guinea for its refinery at nearby Limbe.

In December 2008, Equatorial Guinea security forces killed a Cameroonian fisherman and abducted two immigrants, Cameroon closed its border in response.

North Korea

In the 1970s Equatorial Guinea signed military, technical and economic agreements with many socialist states, which included North Korea. North Korea sent troops to Equatorial Guinea so they could be used as advisors. After Francisco Macías Nguema was overthrown and executed by his nephew Teodoro Obiang in 1979, his family fled to Pyongyang, where his three children were raised by the North Korean government. One of them, Mónica, left the DPRK in 1994 after fifteen years. 

Despite this, close relations continued after the coup, and remain active. In 2011 Yang Hyong-sop, Vice President of the Presidium of the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly, made a four-day visit to Equatorial Guinea. In 2013 President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo was presented the first International Kim Jong Il Prize by a North Korean delegation. In 2016, Kim Yong-nam of North Korea visited Equatorial Guinea and held amicable talks with President Teodoro Obiang. In 2018, Equatorial Guinea reported that it had severed economic ties with North Korea and repatriated North Korean workers in line with United Nations sanctions. However, North Korea reported continued friendly relations. 

Russia

On 26 September 2024, Obiang visited Moscow and had a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin emphasized that Russia and equatorial Guinea have successfully cooperated in OPEC+.

Spain 

In August 1979, Spain offered to help Francisco Macías Nguema during the coup. Between 1979 and 1983, Spain sent Equatorial Guinea 15 million Spanish pesetas for the development of the nation. Relations between both nations almost severed again due to debt renegotiation in 1983 and the fact that Equatorial Guinea owed Spain over 6 million Spanish pesetas. Agreements were made before more drastic measures were taken. During the 2004 coup d&#x27;état attempt, President Obiang accused Spain of knowing about the coup attempt and for sending two Spanish warships to the region, however, Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar denied the allegations that the ships were there to assist in the coup.

In 2016, trade between Equatorial Guinea and Spain totaled €748 million Euros. 90% of Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s exports to Spain is in oil. Spain&#x27;s main exports to Equatorial Guinea include: drinks, furniture and lamps, mechanical equipment, automobiles and trucks, and electronic material. Spain&#x27;s has €3 million Euros of investment in Equatorial Guinea, mainly in the construction industry. At the same time, Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s investment in Spain totals €4 million Euros. Equatorial Guinea is Spain&#x27;s ninth biggest trading partner from Africa (78th largest globally). Spain is Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s third biggest trading partner globally (after China and the United States).

===Economy===

The economy of this small nation continued to struggle under President Obiang, with the country depending mostly on foreign aid to pay its bills. This changed in 1995 when ExxonMobil discovered oil in the country. Massive offshore discoveries over the past decade have boosted oil to about 380,000 barrels per day, ranking Equatorial Guinea behind only Nigeria and Angola among Sub-Saharan African producers.

As expected, income from petroleum led to a boom and the country experienced rapid economic growth. According to UNESCO, the country has the highest adult literacy rate in sub-Saharan Africa, with an average of 95 per cent. It also has the highest per capita income in Africa. More than three-quarters of the population live below the poverty line, according to data from the World bank. This wealth is distributed extremely unevenly and most of it is concentrated in the hands of the ruling family.

President Obiang has a net worth of $600 million, according to &quot;Forbes&quot;, meaning he is easily one of the world’s richest heads of state, while the country&#x27;s HDI ranks 145th out of 191. The vast majority of the oil revenue of Equatorial Guinea has been siphoned under the guise of funding large infrastructure projects executed by contractors with ties to President Obiang’s inner circle. Education and health receive an average of 2–3 per cent of the budget, while extraction has already been declining since 2012 and oil reserves are estimated to dry out by 2035.

===New capital city=== 
In 2012 Obiang ordered the construction of a new planned city, Ciudad de la Paz. The location was chosen for its easy access and milder climate. It is notably on the mainland, in contrast to Malabo, which is on the island of Bioko. It was designed by the Portuguese Studio for Architecture and Urbanism FAT – Future Architecture Thinking. It is projected to have around 200,000 inhabitants, a new Parliament building, a number of presidential villas and an area of 8150 hectares. The construction of this new capital has been criticised by the political opposition to Obiang, the driving force behind the initiative. The Government of Equatorial Guinea began to move to the city in early 2017.

Funding is provided through AICEP Portugal Global. The plans come from a Portuguese architectural office. The construction work will be supported by China, Poland, Brazil and North Korea. Construction faces delays such as, according to unconfirmed reports, President Obiang ordered a building to be moved because he did not like the view. Additionally, all materials are imported.

===Human rights===
In 2006, Obiang signed an anti-torture decree banning all forms of abuse and improper treatment in Equatorial Guinea, and commissioned the renovation and modernization of Black Beach prison in 2007 to ensure the humane treatment of prisoners. However, human rights abuses have continued. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International among other non-governmental organizations have documented severe human rights abuses in prisons, including torture, beatings, unexplained deaths and illegal detention.

In their most recently publishing findings (2020), Transparency International awarded Equatorial Guinea a total score of 16 on their Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). CPI ranks countries by their perceived level of public corruption where zero is very corrupt and 100 is extremely clean. As of 2023, Equatorial Guinea is the 120th lowest scoring nation out of a total of 180 countries. Freedom House, a pro-democracy and human rights NGO, described Obiang as one of the world&#x27;s &quot;most kleptocratic living autocrats&quot;, and complained about the US government welcoming his administration and buying oil from it.

===Abolition of the death penalty===

In September 2022, Obiang signed a law which officially abolished the death penalty and declared it an illegal punishment, even though the last execution took place in 2014, eight years earlier. This was seen as a slight improvement in human rights in the country and this move was praised internationally.

===LGBT+ rights===
Although there are no laws against homosexuality in Equatorial Guinea, the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) reported &quot;there is evidence that State intimidation of sexually diverse individuals persists.&quot; The criminal code in force in Equatorial Guinea is a revision of the Spanish Criminal Code that dates back to the Francoist era and is said to post-colonially carry homophobic undertones that influence those perception today. The age of consent is set at 18, regardless of gender and/or sexual orientation.

==Controversy==

In July 2003, state-operated radio declared Obiang &quot;the country&#x27;s God&quot; with &quot;all power over men and things.&quot; It added that the president was &quot;in permanent contact with the Almighty&quot; and &quot;can decide to kill without anyone calling him to account and without going to hell.&quot; He personally made similar comments in 1993. His uncle and predecessor Macías had also proclaimed himself a god. Despite these comments however, Obiang still claims that he is a devout Catholic and was invited to the Vatican by Pope John Paul II and again by Pope Benedict XVI.

Obiang has encouraged his cult of personality by ensuring that public speeches end in well-wishing for himself rather than for the nation as a whole. Many important buildings have a presidential lodge, many towns and cities have streets commemorating Obiang&#x27;s coup against Macías, and many people wear clothes with his face printed on them.

Like his predecessor and other African strongmen such as Idi Amin and Mobutu Sese Seko, Obiang has assigned himself several creative titles. Among them are &quot;gentleman of the great island of Bioko, Annobón and Río Muni.&quot; He also refers to himself as &quot;El Jefe&quot; (the boss).

In 2008, American journalist Peter Maass called Obiang Africa&#x27;s worst dictator, worse than Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. While he was researching a book on the country&#x27;s oil boom in 2004, Maass recalled that no one approached him on the streets. He believed that the only time he had encountered a more docile populace was in North Korea.

In an October 2012 interview on CNN, Christiane Amanpour asked Obiang whether he would step down at the end of his current term (2009–2016) since he had been reelected at least four times in his reign of over thirty years. In his response, Obiang categorically refused to step down despite term limits in the 2011 constitution.

===Abuses===

Abuses under Obiang have included &quot;unlawful killings by security forces; government-sanctioned kidnappings; systematic torture of prisoners and detainees by security forces; life-threatening conditions in prisons and detention facilities; impunity; arbitrary arrest, detention, and incommunicado detention.&quot;

The few private media outlets in the country are largely owned by people close to Obiang. Freedoms of association and of assembly are severely curtailed, and the government imposes restrictive conditions on the registration and operation of nongovernmental organizations. The few local activists who work on human rights-related issues often face intimidation, harassment, and reprisals.

===Wealth===
&quot;Forbes&quot; has said that Obiang, with a net worth of US$600 million, is one of the world&#x27;s wealthiest heads of state.

In 2003, Obiang told his citizenry that he felt compelled to take full control of the national treasury in order to prevent civil servants from being tempted to engage in corrupt practices. Obiang then deposited more than half a billion dollars into more than sixty accounts controlled by himself and his family at Riggs Bank in Washington, D.C., leading a U.S. federal court to fine the bank $16 million for allowing him to do so. A United States Senate investigation in 2004 found that the Washington-based Riggs Bank had
taken $300 million in payments on behalf of Obiang from ExxonMobil and Hess Corporation.

In 2008, the country became a candidate for the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative – an international project meant to promote openness about government oil revenues – but never qualified and missed the April 2010 deadline. Transparency International includes Equatorial Guinea on its list of twelve most corrupt states.

Beginning in 2007, Obiang and several other African state leaders came under investigation for corruption and fraudulent use of funds. He was suspected of using public funds to finance private mansions and other luxuries for both himself and his family. He and his son, in particular, owned several properties and supercars in France. Several complaints were also filed in US courts against Obiang&#x27;s son. Attorneys stressed that the funds appropriated by the Obiangs were taken quite legally under Equatoguinean laws, even though those laws might not agree with international standards.

The U.S. Department of Justice alleged that Obiang and his son had appropriated hundreds of millions of dollars through corruption. In 2011 and early 2012, many assets were seized from Obiang and his son by the French and American governments, including mansions, wine collections, and supercars. The United States, France and Spain have all investigated the Obiang family&#x27;s use of public funds. The corruption investigation is ongoing.

Obiang, his cabinet and his family allegedly have received billions in undisclosed oil revenue each year from the nation&#x27;s oil production. Marathon Oil purchased land from Abayak, Obiang&#x27;s personal investment vehicle, for more than $2 million; in June 2004 the sale was pending but Marathon had already made a $611,000 first payment with a check made out to Obiang. Marathon also was involved in a joint venture to operate two gas plants with GEOGAM, a quasi-state firm in which Abayak controlled a 75% stake.

Although the cabinet has made moderate increases in social spending, these remain far overshadowed by the spending on, for instance, presidential palaces. In addition, the Obiang administration has been characterized by harassment of dissenters and foreign officials seeking to report on conditions.

Obiang filed a libel lawsuit in a French court against an organization he believed was demeaning his image by saying that his government had committed such acts, but the case was dismissed.

Obiang has made several pledges to commit to open governance, reduce corruption, increase transparency, and improve the quality of life and uphold the basic freedoms of his citizens. Critics say that Obiang&#x27;s government has made very little progress toward this goal, however. Several international groups have called for Obiang to:
* increase fiscal transparency and accountability by publishing all government revenues, and conducting and publishing annual audits of government accounts, including those abroad, and forcing officials to declare assets
* Disclose natural resource revenues
* Greatly increase spending alleviation of poverty
* Uphold political freedoms and rights
* Allow judicial practices to meet international standards
* Cease harassing and hindering his critics
* Allow foreign inspectors and groups to travel freely, unhindered and unharassed.

The U.S. Justice Department has alleged that Obiang&#x27;s son also extorted funds from lumber and construction companies by inflating contractor payments by as much as 500%, then funnelled the funds into a private accounts for his own use. Obiang and his cabinet have defended Kiki, as his son is known. Lawyers uphold his innocence in both US and French courts, saying he received the funds legally though legitimate business enterprises.

Shortly after the emergence of these allegations, Obiang named his son Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s deputy permanent delegate to UNESCO, possibly giving him diplomatic immunity from prosecution. Obiang has created an independent audit task force to review the expenditures and financials of public figures in the government, screen for corruption, and increase financial transparency. The head of this task force, however, was appointed by Obiang himself.

Obiang owns two mansions in the United States, one in Los Angeles and the other in Washington, D.C. He usually goes there for meetings and when he is not in residence there is a caretaker.

===Finances===

Obiang had a close relationship with the Washington DC–based Riggs Bank. He is said to have been welcomed by top Riggs officials, who held a luncheon in his honor. Publicity regarding this relationship would later contribute to the downfall of Riggs.

On 10 November 2010, the Supreme Court of France ruled that a complaint filed by Transparency International in France on 2 December 2008 was admissible to the court system there. The decision allowed the appointment of an investigating judge and a judicial inquiry into claims that Obiang used state funds to purchase private property in France.

A 2010 article published in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine suggested that Obiang gathered roughly $700 million of the country&#x27;s wealth in US bank accounts.

==Personal life==
On December 12, 1968, Obiang married Constancia Mangue Nsue Okomo (born August 20, 1951).

In 2006, it was reported that Obiang favoured his son Teodoro Nguema to succeed him.

<text>Radical behaviorism is a &quot;philosophy of the science of behavior&quot; developed by B. F. Skinner. It refers to the philosophy behind behavior analysis, and is to be distinguished from methodological behaviorism—which has an intense emphasis on observable behaviors—by its inclusion of thinking, feeling, and other private events in the analysis of human and animal psychology. The research in behavior analysis is called the experimental analysis of behavior and the application of the field is called applied behavior analysis (ABA), which was originally termed &quot;behavior modification.&quot;

==Radical behaviorism as natural science==
Radical behaviorism inherits from behaviorism the position that the science of behavior is a natural science, a belief that animal behavior can be studied profitably and compared with human behavior, a strong emphasis on the environment as cause of behavior, and an emphasis on the operations involved in the modification of behavior. Radical behaviorism does not claim that organisms are &quot;tabula rasa&quot; whose behavior is unaffected by biological or genetic endowment. Rather, it asserts that experiential factors play a major role in determining the behavior of many complex organisms, and that the study of these matters is a major field of research in its own right.

==Operant psychology==
Skinner believed that classical conditioning did not account for the behavior that many people are interested in, such as riding a bike or writing a book. His observations led him to propose a theory about how these and similar behaviors, called &quot;operants&quot;, come about.

Roughly speaking, in operant conditioning, an operant is actively emitted and produces changes in the world (i.e., produces consequences) that alter the likelihood that the behavior will occur again.

As represented in the table below, operant conditioning involves two basic actions (increasing or decreasing the probability that a specific behavior will occur in the future), which are accomplished by adding or removing stimuli.

In other words:
* If the probability of a behavior is increased as a consequence of the presentation of a stimulus, that stimulus is a positive reinforcer.
* If the probability of a behavior is increased as a consequence of the withdrawal of a stimulus, that stimulus is a negative reinforcer.
* If the probability of a behavior is decreased as a consequence of the presentation of a stimulus, that stimulus is a positive punisher.
* If the probability of a behavior is decreased as a consequence of the withdrawal of a stimulus, that stimulus is a negative punisher.

Instrumental conditioning is another term for operant conditioning that is most closely associated with scientists who studied organisms running through a maze. Skinner pioneered the free operant technique, where organisms could respond at any time during a protracted experimental session. Thus Skinner&#x27;s dependent variable was usually the frequency or rate of responding, not the errors that were made or the speed of traversal of a maze.

Operant conditioning affects the future of the organism, that is how the organism will respond after the actions summarized above occur.

==Explaining behavior and the importance of the environment==

John B. Watson argued against speaking of mental states and held that psychology should study behavior directly, holding private events as impossible to study scientifically. Skinner rejected this position, conceding the importance of thinking, feelings and &quot;inner behavior&quot; in his analysis. Skinner did not hold to truth by agreement, as Watson did, so he was not limited by observation.

In Watson&#x27;s days (and in Skinner&#x27;s early days), it was held that psychology was at a disadvantage as a science because behavioral explanations should take physiology into account. Very little was known about physiology at the time. Skinner argued that behavioral explanations of psychological phenomena are &quot;just as true&quot; as physiological explanations. In arguing this, he took a non-reductionistic approach to psychology. Skinner, however, redefined behavior to include &quot;everything that an organism does,&quot; including thinking, feeling and speaking, and argued that these phenomena were valid scientific subject matters. The term &quot;radical behaviorism&quot; refers to just this: that everything an organism does is a behavior. However, Skinner ruled out thinking and feeling as valid explanations of behavior. According to him, thinking and feeling are not epiphenomena nor have they any other special status; they are just more behavior to explain. Skinner proposed environmental factors as proper causes of behavior because environmental factors are at a different logical level than behavior and actions, and one can manipulate behavior by manipulating the environment. This holds only for explaining operant behaviors.

Some argue that Skinner held that the organism is a blank slate or a &quot;tabula rasa&quot;. Skinner wrote extensively on the limits and possibilities nature places on conditioning. According to him, conditioning is implemented in the body as a physiological process and is subject to the current state, learning history, and history of the species. Skinner maintained that behavior can be explained without taking into account what goes on inside the organism. However, the black box is not private events, but physiology. Skinner considers physiology useful, interesting, valid, etc., but not necessary for operant behavioral theory and research.

==Private events ==
Radical behaviorism differs from other forms of behaviorism in that it treats everything done as behavior, including private events (such as thinking and feeling) Unlike John B. Watson&#x27;s behaviorism, private events are not dismissed as &quot;epiphenomena,&quot; but are seen as subject to the same principles of learning and modification as have been discovered to exist for overt behavior. Although private events are not publicly observable behaviors, radical behaviorism accepts that one is each an observer of their own private behavior. Skinner explicitly noted that private events were essential for behaviorists to understand and account for, though he also considered them beyond the limits of direct analysis. 

==Outgrowths==
There are radical behaviorist schools of animal training, management, clinical practice, and education. Skinner&#x27;s philosophical views have left their mark in principles adopted by a small handful of utopian communities, such as Los Horcones and Twin Oaks, and in ongoing challenges to aversive techniques in control of human and animal behavior.

Radical behaviorism has generated numerous descendants. Examples of these include molar approaches associated with Richard Herrnstein and William Baum, Howard Rachlin&#x27;s teleological behaviorism, William Timberlake&#x27;s behavior systems approach, and John Staddon&#x27;s theoretical behaviorism. Contextual behavioral science, associated with the works of Steven C. Hayes, is also an interpretation of radical behaviorism.

Skinner&#x27;s theories on verbal behavior have seen widespread application in therapies for children with autism that are based on applied behavior analysis (ABA).

== Criticism ==

Critics such as Noam Chomsky label Skinnerian or radical behaviorism as S–R (stimulus–response, or to use Skinner&#x27;s term, &quot;respondent&quot;), or Pavlovian psychology, and argue that this limits the approach. Chomsky has further argued Skinner&#x27;s experimental results could not be extended to humans. Contemporary psychology rejects many of Skinner&#x27;s conclusions, although some scholars find his work into operant conditioning, which emphasizes the importance of consequences in modifying discriminative responses, useful when combined with current understandings about the uniqueness of evolved human thought compared to other animals.

Some argue that radical behaviorism maintains the position that animals (including humans) are passive receivers of conditioning, although others have countered that operant behavior is titled operant because it operates on the environment, it is emitted, not elicited, and that the consequence of a behavior can itself be a stimulus; one needs not present anything for shaping to take place.

Radical behaviorism is sometimes described as a form of logical positivism. Skinnerians maintain that Skinner was not a logical positivist and recognized the importance of thinking as behavior, as Skinner emphasizes in &quot;About Behaviorism&quot;.

<text>The IBM 632 was a valve-and-relay driven basic (very basic) accounting machine, introduced in 1958, that was available in seven different models. It consisted of an IBM Electric typewriter and at least a punched card unit (like the IBM 024) that housed the &quot;electronics&quot; in two gates (a relay gate and an electronic gate). Some machines also had a card reader unit (like the IBM 026). A small core memory provided storage for 8 numeric 12 digit words.

The machine was programmed primarily with a plastic tape that moved synchronously with the typewriter carriage. Each tape would typically handle one application. The tape mechanism was mounted behind the carriage in the typewriter unit. Further programming was provided in the card machines program drums. Programs were only executed as the machine typed or spaced over a column - tabbing or carriage returning was not recognised.

As the typewriter carriage moved from field to field three program entries were available in the last three columns of each field - as I recall they were Calc1, Calc2, and Pgm. One calculation was allowed in each Calc column. The PGM field allowed a program instruction - a jump in the form of a &quot;jump&quot; to a new column then auto printout of a calculated field (including decimal place control) as well as punched card control, etc. The PGM column was actually the column the typewriter would space to after typing the last character in the field (either under operator or PGM control).

For example, after entering &quot;price&quot; then tabbing and entering &quot;qty&quot;, the machine could automatically space through a dummy field, calculate the $amount on the way and then continue to print it out. The PGM field could then have dictated a carriage return, ready for the next entry.

Two programs were allowed on each tape: primary and alternate. But by resetting the tab-stops it was possible to overlap programs in amazingly complex ways.

Adding was carried out electronically, but multiplication was electro-mechanical. The machine gave off a characteristic kerr-ick-kit-i-tic, kerr-ick-kit-i-tic sound as the relays worked furiously. Multiplication took 3 or 4 seconds, addition, on the other, hand was immediate.

Most machines were used for some type of order-entry/invoicing application, providing a hard-copy invoice and a punched card that could be processed further on some other system. Those with a card reader could do some of that processing themselves, especially if augmented with a sorter.

The first installation was in early 1958 into the Barclay Knitwear company in Kingston, New York. They struck an issue with the 632 because they sold units by the dozen, but because the 632 worked in decimal, rounding meant they were losing money. This was because 1/12 was converted to 0.083. IBM solved the issue by rewiring the 632 so that it worked to five decimal places (0.08333) rather than three.

==Cost, price and rental rates==


Maintenance/service was included in all monthly rental prices.
Maintenance/service for purchased machines was additional.

<text>International folk dance includes Balkan dance, Middle Eastern dance, contra dance, Hungarian dance, polka, Chinese dance, and Japanese dance. Clubs featuring these ethnic dance genres are enjoyed by non-professional dancers for entertainment. Many clubs that use collections of ethnic folk dances will use the term &quot;international folk dance&quot; or similar in their name.

== History ==
International folk dance developed in the immigrant communities of the United States of America during the first half of the 20th century.
Traditional dances such as branles, polkas, quadrilles and others have been done internationally for hundreds of years; however, the creation of international folk dance as such is often attributed to Vytautas Beliajus, a Lithuanian-American who studied, taught, and performed dances from various ethnic traditions in the 1930s.

Also, in the mid 1930s, Scandinavian dancing began to take hold in non-Scandinavian communities. Clubs began to form around this style. A pioneer of this era was the ethnic Chinese illustrator Song Chang, who, struck by the lack of bigotry among the Scandinavian dancers, encouraged others to join, advised clubs, and had a club named in his honor, the Chang&#x27;s International Folk Dancers, still located in San Francisco. Other prominent teachers and promoters of international folk dance in its first few decades included Michael Herman and Mary Ann Herman, Jane Farwell, and Dick Crum.

Those groups known as international folk dance clubs began to take hold in the 1930s and 1940s, with more diverse selections of music than just Scandinavian, with Balkan dances, Western European dances, and dances from the Philippines. The Folk Dance Federation of California was founded in 1942. By 1946, there were approximately 100 clubs in California alone. In 1948, the College of the Pacific Folk Dance Camp, now known as the Stockton Folk Dance Camp, was founded. Other camps were founded later, and all draw on teaching talent both American and foreign. At the inaugural Statewide Festival held in Ojai, California, occurring on May 11, 1946, there were over 500 dancers and 3000 spectators.

In 1964, a new idea took hold in a pair of dancers in Los Angeles. Rudy Dannes and Athan Karras opened a coffeehouse that also functioned as a place for international folk dancers to dance at night without having to worry about renting a space, called The Intersection. The idea took off, with new people starting their own dance coffeehouses, such as Cafe Danssa in L.A., founded by Dani Dassa, and the famous Ashkenaz in Berkeley, founded by David Nadel in 1973.

In 1975, the Folk Arts Center of New England was founded by Conny Taylor and Marianne Taylor to preserve and encourage international folk dancing and other folk arts.

In the 1980s, costs escalated, and the number of active clubs shrank somewhat. Many events such as camps or festivals had to be put on hold until the organizers could gather the money and the people. In 1984, The Intersection shut its doors due to lowering turnout. However, on the East Coast, the NFO, or the National Folk Organization, was founded in Chicago in 1986 by Vytautas Beliajus, Mary Bee Jensen, George Frandsen, and L. DeWayne Young, an organization dedicated to the preservation of folk arts.

In the 1990s, interest in dancing increased again, and dances from the Chinese, Japanese and Hispanic groups were added to the repertoires over the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s as neighborhoods diversified. Ballroom dance, swing dance, tango and salsa dance became more popular, with some dancers from these genres also entering the international folk dance scene as a whole.

International folk dance has grown into a large community of dancers, performing groups and recreational folk dance clubs throughout the United States, Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and other countries. Dance festivals and conventions are held year-round. Dance &quot;camps&quot; or workshops invite teachers to instruct dancers in dances from many traditions. These groups usually focus on European dances, but the international folk dance repertoire may include dances from every part of the world: Europe, Africa, North and South America, the Middle East, the Far East, Australia and the South Pacific.

== Clubs ==
The most common way to dance &quot;international folk dance&quot; is in a club setting. These can range in style of organization from a small gathering to highly structured and regulated meetings, depending on the preferences of the dancers. Many clubs are associated with international folk dance societies or federations, such as the Folk Dance Federation of California, who provide them with music and exposure. A club can have a mixture of dances on their playlist, or specialize in a single genre or a few genres. (For example, a club could be a Serbian dance club, or a Balkan dance club, or a mixed repertoire with a preference for Balkan, or a club with no preference and a varied playlist.) Many require no experience or partner whatsoever to participate. The most common genres of the clubs that choose a specific genre are Balkan dance, contra dance, and English country dance.

== Classes ==
Many clubs are also classes, or are entirely so. Classes usually have a master teacher, either creating their own event or using time at a club, teaching new dances to add to the repertoire. These are always open to the public and usually have a &quot;party&quot; afterwards where people dance to requests. Some master teachers teach for their livelihoods, while others are local dancers with the will to teach.

== Festivals ==
Festivals are multi-day events that combine the club and class atmosphere. Often a day will be mostly full of teaching sessions and the evening for dancing and requests. Often they sell food to dancers as well. Examples of festivals include the Zlatne Uste Golden Festival in New York City, the Blossom Festival in San Francisco, the Kolo Festival in San Francisco, and the Tanatsfestival in Belgium.

== Camps ==
Camps are essentially festivals that include room and board. Oftentimes dancers sleep on-site or in a hotel that has specifically been reserved for the event, with food and drinks also provided to the dancers. Famous camps include the Stockton Folk Dance Camp in Stockton, CA and Camp Yofi in Italy.

<text>The IBM 6400 family of line matrix printers were modern highspeed business computer printers introduced by IBM in 1995. These printers were designed for use on a variety IBM systems including mainframes, servers, and PCs.

==Configuration==
The 6400 was available in a choice of open pedestal (to minimize floor size requirements) or an enclosed cabinet (for quiet operation). Three models existed, with print speeds of 500, 1000 or 1500 lines/minute.

When configured with the appropriate graphics option, it could print mailing bar codes &quot;certified by the U.S. Postal service. Twelve configurations were commonly sold by IBM.

==Rebadged==
These printers were manufactured by Printronix Corp and rebranded for IBM. All internal parts had the Printronix Logo and/or artwork. Although they once did, IBM no longer manufactures printers. One of their old printer divisions became Lexmark The other became the IBM Printing Systems Division, which was subsequently sold to Ricoh in 2007.

<doc id="263632" wikidata="Q2519212" url="?curid=263632" title="Jack Aubrey">
<text>John &quot;Jack&quot; Aubrey , is a fictional character in the Aubrey–Maturin series of novels by Patrick O&#x27;Brian. The series of novels portrays his rise from lieutenant to rear admiral in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. The twenty (and one incomplete draft)-book series encompasses Aubrey&#x27;s adventures and various commands along his course to flying a rear admiral&#x27;s flag.

Some of his naval battles and adventures are drawn from Royal Navy history. Several of his exploits and reverses, most importantly those in the plots of &quot;Master and Commander&quot;, &quot;The Reverse of the Medal&quot; and &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot;, are directly based on the chequered career of Thomas Cochrane. Often in the other 17 novels in the series, 

Besides reaching the peak of naval skills and authority, Aubrey is presented as being interested in mathematics and astronomy, a great lover of music and player of the violin, a hearty singer and is generally accompanied by his friend and shipmate Stephen Maturin on the cello. He is noted for his mangling and mis-splicing of proverbs, sometimes with Maturin&#x27;s involvement, such as “Never count the bear’s skin before it is hatched” and “There’s a good deal to be said for making hay while the iron is hot.” 

Aubrey is played by Russell Crowe in the 2003 film &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot; and by Michael Troughton and David Robb in the BBC Radio 4 adaptations of the novels.

==Education and early life==

Aubrey&#x27;s mother died when he was a boy; he is an only child. His father General Aubrey lives a longer life, and is a character in some of the novels, often working against the career interest of his son with clumsy politics. In &quot;Master and Commander,&quot; Aubrey describes the efforts of his slightly older neighbour &quot;Queeney&quot; to teach him some Latin and the mathematics associated with a sailing ship and its navigation so that he could pass his examination for lieutenant, an event that happened before the first novel. Queeney&#x27;s family had occupied Damplow when Aubrey was a boy, a house adjoining General Aubrey&#x27;s estate (&quot;they were almost in our park&quot;).

Queeney appears in Aubrey&#x27;s life when she marries Lord Keith, who heads up the Mediterranean Fleet of the Royal Navy. In the first novel, Lord Keith gave him his promotion to master and commander and his first command, and Lord Keith is married to Queeney at that time. Queeney is the historic Hester Maria Elphinstone, Viscountess Keith, and in Queeney&#x27;s mother the reader will recognise the historic Hester Thrale.

==Early career==
&quot;This section covers the career of Aubrey before the Aubrey-Maturin series, for more information on that period, see the individual books.&quot;

Like many officers in the British fleet, Aubrey spent much of his life raised on the sea, joining the navy very early: he was on the books at the age of nine and at sea when he was twelve. While a midshipman aboard HMS &quot;Resolution&quot; commanded by a friend of General Aubrey&#x27;s, Captain Douglas, Jack was turned before the mast for hiding a girl aboard the ship. He spent six months as a common seaman before being re-rated as a midshipman. This was when Lord Keith was still Captain Elphinstone, therefore pre-1797.

Aubrey also spent some time as fifth lieutenant aboard HMS &quot;Hannibal&quot; (in service 1786–1801), under Captain John Newman. There, after insulting the first lieutenant, he was put in front of a board, with Lord Keith upon it, which reprimanded him for his &quot;petulance,&quot; which led to Aubrey spending eight months ashore with half pay.

While second lieutenant aboard , Aubrey was the leader of the prize crew for the &quot;Généreux&quot; after it was captured by Nelson&#x27;s fleet in 1800. He earned a silver Nile medal, having served as a lieutenant aboard HMS &quot;Leander&quot; during the battle of the Nile in 1798, mentioned in &quot;Master and Commander&quot;. The Nile Medal is mentioned whenever Aubrey wears his dress uniform. The Battle of the Nile was a major turning point in the long wars between the United Kingdom and Napoleon&#x27;s France, in which dominance on the sea went to the United Kingdom. Horatio Nelson became a hero for his role in that 1798 battle.

==Career and characteristics depicted in the novels==

Aubrey is between twenty and thirty years old when the first story opens, a lieutenant passing time on the island of Minorca, at a musical performance. When he returns to his inn, his letter of promotion to master and commander awaits him. He is given his first command: a fourteen-gun brig-rigged sloop, HMS &quot;Sophie&quot;. He rises to the rank of post captain, though he is once struck off the Navy List, reinstated, then suspends himself in 1814 as peace comes in spring. As was the practice in the Royal Navy, once on the list of post captains, he moved up the list for promotion to admiral by the end of the series of novels, set during the Napoleonic Wars.

In his early career, according to &quot;HMS Surprise&quot;, Aubrey was not a skilled mathematician. In that book, he is described as learning mathematics and &quot;...he studied the mathematics, and like some other late-developers he advanced at a great pace.&quot; In later books, Aubrey is presented as interested and skilled in mathematics and astronomy. He is also a great lover of music and player of the violin; he is a hearty singer. He is a man of even temperament, generally cheerful, sociable and alert to the feelings of his shipmates. He knows every aspect of the ships he sails and how best to gain speed over the oceans from each one by use of the sails without putting too much stress on the masts or yards (which would then break), a complex and hard-earned knowledge. He has been described as &quot;the bluff and ultracompetent Aubrey&quot;. He feels the joy of battle; he is skilled in planning his attacks and in carrying them out, using cannon or hand-to-hand fighting. By contrast, he cannot watch his close friend, Dr Maturin, perform a surgery, and is sickened at the sight of blood on Maturin, the natural result of performing surgeries. On board ship, Aubrey on his violin is generally accompanied by his friend and shipmate Stephen Maturin on the cello. Aubrey is particularly fond of the music of Corelli and Boccherini. He is noted for his mangling and mis-splicing of proverbs, sometimes with Maturin&#x27;s involvement, such as “Never count the bear’s skin before it is hatched” and “There’s a good deal to be said for making hay while the iron is hot.” 

Maturin enters actively into the humour of fractured proverbs by the eighth novel, &quot;The Ionian Mission&quot;, as shown in this exchange between the two friends in Chapter 10: &#x27;Why, as to that,&#x27; said Jack, blowing on his coffee-cup and staring out of the stern-window at the harbour, &#x27;as to that ... if you do not choose to call him a pragmatical clinchpoop and kick his breech, which you might think ungenteel, perhaps you could tell him to judge the pudding by its fruit.&#x27; &#x27;You mean, prove the tree by its eating.&#x27; &#x27;No, no, Stephen, you are quite out: eating a tree would prove nothing. And then you might ask him, had he ever seen many poltroons in the Navy?&#x27; &#x27;I am not quite sure what you mean by poltroons.&#x27;

Aubrey frequently mentions his respect of Lord Nelson, repeating a line he heard him say at a dinner in his early life in the navy, &quot;Never mind manoeuvres, always go at them,&quot; in Chapter 3 of &quot;Master and Commander&quot; and in many of the subsequent novels, then quoted by Tom Pullings as &quot;Never mind manoeuvres, always go straight at them.&quot; In one of his letters to his wife written from Boston, when Aubrey has a wounded right arm and can write to her only with his left hand, he couches this news of his injury to her as part of his desire to imitate Nelson in all things, except matrimonially, in Chapter 4 of &quot;The Fortune of War&quot;.

He enjoys the company of women. From the incident of keeping a girl aboard ship in his youth, unbeknownst to him, she was pregnant when he sailed away. Their son, Samuel Panda, appears in Aubrey&#x27;s life fully grown and educated, a dark-skinned version of himself, but a Catholic priest. Before he knew of this young man, Aubrey married Sophia Williams, whom he met and courted in the peace of 1802, when he was on land. They married and had three children, twin daughters Fanny and Charlotte, and a son George. He loves his family, though most of the time he is away on a ship.

When his father dies, Jack Aubrey inherits the Aubrey family estate and the role of lord of the manor in &quot;The Letter of Marque&quot;. He displays extensive knowledge of the laws and practices surrounding that role in &quot;The Yellow Admiral&quot;, when he opposes enclosing the only commons left to the manor. His good connections with his neighbours in Woolcombe gain him a seat in Parliament from the pocket borough held by his neighbour Cousin Edward Norton; gaining that seat aided in his restoration to the Navy List. He sits as justice of the peace for certain local matters. This knowledge and well-tempered judgement seems to match with his skill in running a tight ship, a happy ship, and is a contrast to his financial faux pas. He can earn the money by taking rich prizes, but only with the help of his wife&#x27;s good management and his lawyer&#x27;s persistence at winning in lawsuits meant to take it from him, does the money stay in his hands for good uses.

==Watches real battles, fights fictional battles==

Aubrey is a prisoner of war with a perfect view of the naval battle in Algeciras Bay in &quot;Master and Commander&quot;. He is a passenger aboard HMS &quot;Java&quot; when she is captured by USS &quot;Constitution&quot; in &quot;The Fortune of War&quot;. Again a prisoner of war, Aubrey arrives in Boston aboard USS &quot;Constitution&quot;. He heals from a serious wound in Boston. He, Maturin and Diana Villiers escape aboard HMS &quot;Shannon&quot;, which defeats USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot; in Boston Harbor as part of the War of 1812, also in &quot;The Fortune of War&quot;. The battles in which Aubrey participates are inspired by real ship engagements, but not involving the same ships by name, or sometimes by exact date of the real encounter. An example of this is Aubrey&#x27;s first command, HMS &quot;Sophie&quot; taking a far heavier Spanish frigate with 32 12-pound guns to the &quot;Sophie&quot;″s 14 4-pounders and a crew of 319 compared to 56, which is very similar to an encounter of HMS &quot;Speedy&quot; under Cochrane in May 1801.

The taking of the two islands in &quot;The Mauritius Command&quot; is closely based on the actual Mauritius campaign of 1809–1811, and the encounter with the Spanish ships carrying gold from their South American colonies that closes the story in &quot;Post Captain&quot;, with Aubrey in temporary command of one of the British ships, closely matches the Battle of Cape Santa Maria, including the names of the British and Spanish ships in the encounter.

Most of his naval battles and adventures are drawn from actual Royal Navy history. Several of his exploits and reverses, most importantly those in the plots of &quot;Master and Commander&quot;, &quot;The Reverse of the Medal&quot; and &quot;Blue at the Mizzen&quot;, are directly based on the chequered career of Thomas Cochrane: as his friend the botanist and surgeon Stephen Maturin mused, &quot;There was something of Cochrane in Jack, a restless impatience of authority, a strong persuasion of being in the right.&quot;

==Ships commanded by Jack Aubrey==

During the series of novels, Jack Aubrey commands a succession of many different vessels. Most of them are warships of the Royal Navy, prefixed HMS (His Majesty&#x27;s Ship). On one occasion he commands an Honourable East India Company ship, and for some time after she is sold out of the service, the &quot;Surprise&quot; is a hired vessel working for the Royal Navy (HMHV), having been purchased by Stephen Maturin. The &quot;Franklin&quot; is a privateer Jack Aubrey captures and uses for a brief time before he sells it. The status of the &quot;Nutmeg of Consolation&quot; is undefined, as she belongs to Stamford Raffles, the Governor of Batavia. Although the names and characteristics of real Royal Navy ships are used in the novels, the ships often do not take the same cruises or appear in the same battles as they did in history. In his first memorable success, he uses the smaller HM Sloop &quot;Sophie&quot; to take a larger Spanish vessel. The battle action is based on Cochrane&#x27;s similar feat as captain of the HM Sloop &quot;Speedy&quot; in 1800.

==Awards and rewards==

Aubrey earned the silver Nile medal and wore it on his dress uniform always (mentioned in nearly every novel when the dress uniform is donned). He earned it as a lieutenant in an action before the series began, in the 1798 Battle of the Nile. His portrait was painted to hang at home, showing him wearing the red ribbon of the Order of the Bath, described at the start of &quot;Desolation Island&quot;, after he returned from great success in &quot;The Mauritius Command&quot;. The Order of the Bath at that date was an order of knighthood and the recipient would invariably be titled &quot;Sir&quot; unless they had a higher title. However, O&#x27;Brian never refers to Aubrey as Sir John, nor does the author have any other character refer to him as Sir John, in any of the novels.

He also received an elaborate diamond chelengk, earned in &quot;The Ionian Mission&quot; from the Turks, and mentioned in &quot;Treason&#x27;s Harbour&quot; as having been saved by Killick. He has a Lloyd&#x27;s 100-guinea presentation sword, mentioned in the start of &quot;The Reverse of the Medal&quot; and in &quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot;. The Order of the Bath ribbon is again mentioned in the unfinished novel &quot;The Final Unfinished Voyage of Jack Aubrey&quot;, when Aubrey is about to step aboard the ship flying his broad pennant as Rear Admiral of the Blue.

Aubrey is described with his military awards at the start of &quot;The Reverse of the Medal&quot;.

Grateful owners of merchant ships honoured Aubrey with gifts of silver plate and cash when his efforts protected their ships and cargo. In &quot;HMS Surprise&quot;, the merchants in Calcutta pay to refit his ship. In &quot;The Letter of Marque&quot;, Aubrey receives a gift of silver plate from the merchants whose ships had been harried by a French-American privateer captured by the &quot;Surprise&quot;, herself a British letter of marque.

==Heraldry==

The Aubreys were an old land holding family who owned various, though untitled, lordships of the manor. Their arms were azure, 3 sheep&#x27;s heads erased, proper. In addition, Jack was granted the augmentation of 2 Moors&#x27; heads, proper, on this arms in honour of his success in the Mauritius campaign.

The complete achievement below shows Jack&#x27;s awards: the silver Nile medal awarded by his hero Admiral Nelson and the insignia of a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, which he is entitled to as he was given the Bath for the Mauritius Campaign (notional year above 1809) and so before the reorganization of the Order in 1815. Due to the reorganization in 1815, the existing Knights Companion (of which there were 60) became Knight Grand Cross. Knights Grand Cross and Knights Commander, as the earlier pre-1815 knights, have the privilege of prefixing &quot;Sir&quot; to their forenames. Wives of these Knights may prefix &quot;Lady&quot; to their surnames. However, neither Jack nor Sophie were ever called &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Lady&quot; in the novels. Knights Grand Cross are also entitled to receive heraldic supporters. O&#x27;Brian never mentioned any supporters for Jack&#x27;s arms. Furthermore, knights grand cross may encircle their arms with a depiction of the circlet (a red circle bearing the motto) with the badge pendant and the collar; the former is shown either outside or on top of the latter. Also shown are crossed anchors and crossed flags representing Jack&#x27;s rank in the Royal Navy, the right flag showing his final rank in the books as Rear Admiral of the Blue.

==Portrayed in adaptations of the novels==

Jack Aubrey is played by Russell Crowe in the 2003 film &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot;. He is played by David Robb in the BBC Radio 4 adaptations of the novels. Played by Michael Troughton in BBC Radio 4 six part adaption &quot;Master and Commander&quot; (1995).

<text>A transport museum is a museum that holds collections of transport items, which are often limited to land transport (road and rail)—including old cars, motorcycles, trucks, trains, trams/streetcars, buses, trolleybuses and coaches—but can also include air transport or waterborne transport items, along with educational displays and other old transport objects. Some transport museums are housed in disused transport infrastructure such as dismantled trolley systems, former engine sheds or bus garages.

<text>Vaitupu is the largest atoll of the nation of Tuvalu. It is located at 7.48 degrees south and 178.83 degrees east. There are 1,061 people (2017 Census) living on with the main village being Asau.

==History==
===Discovery and settlement===
The exact date of Vaitupu&#x27;s first settlement is unknown. According to oral history, the founder of the Vaitupuan community was a Samoan by the name of Telematua, who arrived in the 16th or 17th century. However, it is possible that Tongans may have first reached the atoll during the mid-13th century. Vaitupu has maintained contacts with Tonga throughout its history, both peaceful (alliances through marriage) and hostile (visits by Tongan slave-seekers). Vaitupu was also visited by I-Kiribati, and was thus far from isolated.
Vaitupu means &#x27;the fountain of water&#x27;.

Obed Starbuck—captain of the whaler &quot;Loper&quot; from Nantucket, Massachusetts—sighted the island on 26 April 1826, naming it &#x27;Tracy Island&#x27;. William Plaskett, captain of the Nantucket whaler &quot;Independence II,&quot; called at Vaitupu on 21 August 1827. Given Starbuck&#x27;s earlier sighting of the island, the log entry by Plaskett for the day that he rediscovered it suggests the locals hadn&#x27;t seen another ship before then:

[...] At daylight found it to be a small low island about 6 miles long. [...] Having one native and an interpreter on board who we brought from Rotumah, who formerly belonged to one of the islands about here and who understood their language we learned that they had never seen a ship before. The natives name of this island is voytopu. It is not laid down on the books or charts so we call it a new discovery. Lat.7°-25 [south] Longitude 178°-78 East.

===19th century===
The United States Exploring Expedition under Charles Wilkes visited Vaitupu in 1841.

Samoan pastors from the London Missionary Society successfully introduced Christianity to the island in the 1860s. The pastors implemented religious regulations, outlawing many cultural practices. They also introduced the Samoan language, as their Bibles were written in Samoan. Vaitupuans became literate in Samoan rather than in their own language. Henry (Harry) Nitz, the resident trader, helped in the construction of the first church.

Vaitupuans celebrate Te Aso Fiafia (Happy Day) on 25 November of each year. Te Aso Fiafia commemorates 25 November 1887 which was the date on which the final instalment of a debt of $13,000 was repaid to H. M. Ruge and Company, a German trading firm that operated from Apia, Samoa. Vaitupu history is that Thomas William Williams, the Ruge agent, pretended to do his customers a favour by allowing them to obtain goods on credit. In 1883 the debt of the Vaitupuans was $13,000 and H. M. Ruge and Company had threatened to seize the entire island unless the debt was repaid. Neemia, a Vaitupuan pastor living in Samoa, returned and organised working parties to collect coconuts and prepare copra to sell to pay off the debt, with Henry Nitz, the Webber &amp; Co agent on Vaitupu, contributing money to meet the final payment. The Vaitupuans, with the help of their friends from Funafuti, repaid the debt by the due date. Seven thousand dollars was repaid by 1886 and the balance was paid on 25 November 1887.

Vaitupuan tradition is that chance favoured their efforts, a ship sent to collect the last payment sank, as did the second ship the trading schooner &quot;Vaitupulemele&quot;. By the time a third ship arrived most of the money had been collected. However, the trading schooner &quot;Vaitupulemele&quot; appears to have a different role in the history of Vaitupu. The creation of the debt that was repaid to Ruge &amp; Co extended beyond the purchase of goods on credit to include the purchase price of the &quot;Vaitupulemele&quot; by the Vaitupu Company. While T.M. Williams had been the Ruge agent, he later formed the Vaitupu Company with the Vaitupuan community and purchased the &quot;Vaitupulemele&quot; from Ruge &amp; Co. However the schooner was lost during a voyage from Samoa and soon after Williams died, leaving no accounting for copra that had been shipped from Vaitupu. In any event the Vaitupuans paid the full amount claimed by Ruge &amp; Co, although that company soon after went into liquidation.

===20th century===
Vaitupu Post Office opened around 1916.

Donald Gilbert Kennedy, the resident District Officer in the administration of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony from 1932 to 1938, describe the construction of &quot;paopao&quot; and of the variations of single-outrigger canoes that had been developed on Vaitupu and Nanumea.

Neli Lifuka was the magistrate on Vaitupu from 1945 to 1951. He was instrumental in collecting the funds to purchase Kioa Island in Fiji. Initially 37 people migrated from Vaitupu to live on Kioa Island; within a decade, more than 235 people followed.

On 30 January and 1 February 1990, Cyclone Ofa had a major impact on Vaitupu, with around 85 percent of residential homes, trees and food crops being destroyed.

===21st century===
Vaitupu received worldwide attention in 2000, when a fire in a dormitory at the Motufoua school killed 18 girls and a female adult supervisor. It was later discovered that the fire was caused by a student using a candle to read during the night. The Prime Minister Ionatana Ionatana declared a national tragedy and quickly travelled to the island to witness the aftermath. A memorial service was held the following year in memory of the 18 girls and their matron who died. Tuvaluan leaders as well as parents of the victims attended the memorial service.

In the 2011 Tuvalu drought, Vaitupu experienced the loss of coconut palm trees, pulaka and taro due to the high temperatures and arid soil.

In March 2015, storm surges resulting from Cyclone Pam caused damage to houses, crops and infrastructure.

==Geography==
The island, which covers approximately , includes swamps, mangroves, a fringing coral reef, and a large lagoon.

Vaitupu atoll consists of at least nine isles:
* Luasamotu
* Mosana (group of 2)
* Motutanifa
* Temotu
* Te Motu Olepa
* Tofia
* Vaitupu proper
* and at least one other islet

The biggest island is Vaitupu proper, followed by Tofia.

The only village on Vaitupu consists of the neighbourhoods Tumaseu and Asau. There is a church, Tolise Primary School, at least one guesthouse and a post office. An aquaculture project has been established in the lagoon.

==Renewable energy==
In 2010 what was then described as the largest diesel-solar photovoltaic (PV) hybrid electricity system in the South Pacific was installed at Motufoua Secondary School. Prior to the instalment of the system the school relied upon a diesel powered generator, which needed to be turned off during the night. The hybrid system systems saves thousands of dollars in diesel costs and provides the school with a 24-hour supply of energy, with up to 200 kWh per day.

In 2014 New Zealand and the European Union agreed to provide finance to the Government of Tuvalu to install battery-backed solar photovoltaic (PV) systems for the outer islands. From January to March 2015 Powersmart, a New Zealand company, implemented German solar power technology to build the new Vaitupu powerhouse.

==Transportation and tourism==
There is a wharf on Vaitupu but no harbour, meaning passengers must board a smaller boat from the inter-island passenger/cargo ships to get to the Vaitupu. There are paths and small unpaved roads throughout the island. Only a few cars drive on Vaitupu. In the main village there is a guest house called Vivalia III located at the wharf near the main church.

==Culture==
The community activities on Vaitupu include the &quot;Nafa Moa&quot; and &quot;Talo&quot; (Taro crops and chickens competition). In this contest the community is divided into two rival teams. Members of each team compete for who can grow the heavier taro or larger chickens; the climax comes with the weigh-off between the competitors, concluding a day of good-natured rivalry and fun.

==Demographics==
The population of Vaitupu from 1860 to 1900 is estimated to be 400 people. Vaitupu is home to the second-largest population in Tuvalu, numbering 1,576 (2002 Census) and 1,555 (2012 census). Despite its relatively large size, Vaitupu became so overcrowded during the 1940s that a number of families migrated to Fiji to live on Kioa Island.

In the 2012 census, the population of the villages of Vaitupu were:
* Apalolo - Saniuta: 263
* Tumaseu: 248
* Potufale: 230
* Asau: 198

==Politics==
Paulson Panapa and Maina Talia were elected in the 2024 general election.


==Education==
The primary school on Vaitupu is called Tolise, which was established in 1953. A secondary school called Elisefou (New Ellice), opened in 1923 and closed in 1953 when the boys were transferred to King George V School located in Bikenibeu, South Tarawa. The first headmaster of Elisefou was Donald Gilbert Kennedy, who was a strict disciplinarian who would not hesitate to beat his students. The two most famous Tuvaluans from the school were Tuvalu&#x27;s first Governor General, Sir Fiatau Penitala Teo and its first Prime Minister, Toaripi Lauti. Kennedy published &quot;Field Notes on the Culture of Vaitupu, Ellice Islands&quot; in the Journal of the Polynesian Society in instalments between 1929 and 1932 and as a book in 1931.

Motufoua Secondary School was established in 1905 by the London Missionary Society. Over time the school has evolved and it is now a boarding school for boys and girls that is administered by the Department of Education. In 2009 the student roll at Motufoua Secondary School was 550. In the 2012 census, 502 people were recorded as being at Motufoua Secondary School.

==Notable residents==
The Reverend Sir Filoimea Telito (19 March 1945 – 11 July 2011) as a young man was a teacher at Motufoua Secondary School. After completing theological studies, he returned to Motufoua to serve as Pastor. Later he became Principal of Motufoua. He served as the Governor-General of Tuvalu (2005-2010).

Sir Tomasi Puapua represented Vaitupu in the Parliament of Tuvalu. He was the second Prime Minister (1981–1989). Puapua later served as Governor-General of Tuvalu (1998–2003).

Apisai Ielemia (19 August 1955 – 19 November 2018) represented Vaitupu in the Parliament of Tuvalu. He served as Prime Minister of Tuvalu (2006–2010).

Taukelina Finikaso represented Vaitupu in the parliament from 2006 to 2019. He served as Minister of Communications and Works (2006–2010) and served as the Foreign Minister in the Sopoaga Ministry (2013-2019).

<text>Connectionism is an approach to the study of human mental processes and cognition that utilizes mathematical models known as connectionist networks or artificial neural networks.

Connectionism has had many &quot;waves&quot; since its beginnings. The first wave appeared 1943 with Warren Sturgis McCulloch and Walter Pitts both focusing on comprehending neural circuitry through a formal and mathematical approach, and Frank Rosenblatt who published the 1958 paper &quot;The Perceptron: A Probabilistic Model For Information Storage and Organization in the Brain&quot; in &quot;Psychological Review&quot;, while working at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory.
The first wave ended with the 1969 book about the limitations of the original perceptron idea, written by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert, which contributed to discouraging major funding agencies in the US from investing in connectionist research. With a few noteworthy deviations, most connectionist research entered a period of inactivity until the mid-1980s. The term &quot;connectionist model&quot; was reintroduced in a 1982 paper in the journal &quot;Cognitive Science&quot; by Jerome Feldman and Dana Ballard.

The second wave blossomed in the late 1980s, following a 1987 book about Parallel Distributed Processing by James L. McClelland, David E. Rumelhart et al., which introduced a couple of improvements to the simple perceptron idea, such as intermediate processors (now known as &quot;hidden layers&quot;) alongside input and output units, and used a sigmoid activation function instead of the old &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; function. Their work built upon that of John Hopfield, who was a key figure investigating the mathematical characteristics of sigmoid activation functions. From the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, connectionism took on an almost revolutionary tone when Schneider, Terence Horgan and Tienson posed the question of whether connectionism represented a fundamental shift in psychology and so-called &quot;good old-fashioned AI,&quot; or GOFAI. Some advantages of the second wave connectionist approach included its applicability to a broad array of functions, structural approximation to biological neurons, low requirements for innate structure, and capacity for graceful degradation. Its disadvantages included the difficulty in deciphering how ANNs process information or account for the compositionality of mental representations, and a resultant difficulty explaining phenomena at a higher level.

The current (third) wave has been marked by advances in deep learning, which have made possible the creation of large language models. The success of deep-learning networks in the past decade has greatly increased the popularity of this approach, but the complexity and scale of such networks has brought with them increased interpretability problems.

==Basic principle==
The central connectionist principle is that mental phenomena can be described by interconnected networks of simple and often uniform units. The form of the connections and the units can vary from model to model. For example, units in the network could represent neurons and the connections could represent synapses, as in the human brain. This principle has been seen as an alternative to GOFAI and the classical theories of mind based on symbolic computation, but the extent to which the two approaches are compatible has been the subject of much debate since their inception.

===Activation function===

Internal states of any network change over time due to neurons sending a signal to a succeeding layer of neurons in the case of a feedforward network, or to a previous layer in the case of a recurrent network. Discovery of non-linear activation functions has enabled the second wave of connectionism.

===Memory and learning===

Neural networks follow two basic principles:

# Any mental state can be described as a &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vector of numeric activation values over neural units in a network.
# Memory and learning are created by modifying the &#x27;weights&#x27; of the connections between neural units, generally represented as an &quot;n&quot;×&quot;m&quot; matrix. The weights are adjusted according to some learning rule or algorithm, such as Hebbian learning.

Most of the variety among the models comes from:
* &quot;Interpretation of units&quot;: Units can be interpreted as neurons or groups of neurons.
* &quot;Definition of activation&quot;: Activation can be defined in a variety of ways. For example, in a Boltzmann machine, the activation is interpreted as the probability of generating an action potential spike, and is determined via a logistic function on the sum of the inputs to a unit.
* &quot;Learning algorithm&quot;: Different networks modify their connections differently. In general, any mathematically defined change in connection weights over time is referred to as the &quot;learning algorithm&quot;.

===Biological realism===
Connectionist work in general does not need to be biologically realistic. One area where connectionist models are thought to be biologically implausible is with respect to error-propagation networks that are needed to support learning, but error propagation can explain some of the biologically-generated electrical activity seen at the scalp in event-related potentials such as the N400 and P600, and this provides some biological support for one of the key assumptions of connectionist learning procedures. Many recurrent connectionist models also incorporate dynamical systems theory. Many researchers, such as the connectionist Paul Smolensky, have argued that connectionist models will evolve toward fully continuous, high-dimensional, non-linear, dynamic systems approaches.

==Precursors==
Precursors of the connectionist principles can be traced to early work in psychology, such as that of William James. Psychological theories based on knowledge about the human brain were fashionable in the late 19th century. As early as 1869, the neurologist John Hughlings Jackson argued for multi-level, distributed systems. Following from this lead, Herbert Spencer&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Psychology&quot;, 3rd edition (1872), and Sigmund Freud&#x27;s &quot;Project for a Scientific Psychology&quot; (composed 1895) propounded connectionist or proto-connectionist theories. These tended to be speculative theories. But by the early 20th century, Edward Thorndike was writing about human learning that posited a connectionist type network.

Hopfield networks had precursors in the Ising model due to Wilhelm Lenz (1920) and Ernst Ising (1925), though the Ising model conceived by them did not involve time. Monte Carlo simulations of Ising model required the advent of computers in the 1950s.

==The first wave==
The first wave begun in 1943 with Warren Sturgis McCulloch and Walter Pitts both focusing on comprehending neural circuitry through a formal and mathematical approach. McCulloch and Pitts showed how neural systems could implement first-order logic: Their classic paper &quot;A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity&quot; (1943) is important in this development here. They were influenced by the work of Nicolas Rashevsky in the 1930s and symbolic logic in the style of &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;.

Hebb contributed greatly to speculations about neural functioning, and proposed a learning principle, Hebbian learning. Lashley argued for distributed representations as a result of his failure to find anything like a localized engram in years of lesion experiments. Friedrich Hayek independently conceived the model, first in a brief unpublished manuscript in 1920, then expanded into a book in 1952.

The Perceptron machines were proposed and built by Frank Rosenblatt, who published the 1958 paper “The Perceptron: A Probabilistic Model For Information Storage and Organization in the Brain” in &quot;Psychological Review&quot;, while working at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory. He cited Hebb, Hayek, Uttley, and Ashby as main influences.

Another form of connectionist model was the relational network framework developed by the linguist Sydney Lamb in the 1960s.

The research group led by Widrow empirically searched for methods to train two-layered ADALINE networks (MADALINE), with limited success.

A method to train multilayered perceptrons with arbitrary levels of trainable weights was published by Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko and Valentin Lapa in 1965, called the Group Method of Data Handling. This method employs incremental layer by layer training based on regression analysis, where useless units in hidden layers are pruned with the help of a validation set.

The first multilayered perceptrons trained by stochastic gradient descent was published in 1967 by Shun&#x27;ichi Amari. In computer experiments conducted by Amari&#x27;s student Saito, a five layer MLP with two modifiable layers learned useful internal representations to classify non-linearily separable pattern classes.

In 1972, Shun&#x27;ichi Amari produced an early example of self-organizing network.

== The neural network winter ==
There was some conflict among artificial intelligence researchers as to what neural networks are useful for. Around late 1960s, there was a widespread lull in research and publications on neural networks, &quot;the neural network winter&quot;, which lasted through the 1970s, during which the field of artificial intelligence turned towards symbolic methods. The publication of &quot;Perceptrons&quot; (1969) is typically regarded as a catalyst of this event.

==The second wave==
The second wave begun in the early 1980s. Some key publications included (John Hopfield, 1982) which popularized Hopfield networks, the 1986 paper that popularized backpropagation, and the 1987 two-volume book about the &quot;Parallel Distributed Processing&quot; (PDP) by James L. McClelland, David E. Rumelhart et al., which has introduced a couple of improvements to the simple perceptron idea, such as intermediate processors (known as &quot;hidden layers&quot; now) alongside input and output units and using sigmoid activation function instead of the old &#x27;all-or-nothing&#x27; function.

Hopfield approached the field from the perspective of statistical mechanics, providing some early forms of mathematical rigor that increased the perceived respectability of the field. Another important series of publications proved that neural networks are universal function approximators, which also provided some mathematical respectability.

Some early popular demonstration projects appeared during this time. NETtalk (1987) learned to pronounce written English. It achieved popular success, appearing on the &quot;Today&quot; show. TD-Gammon (1992) reached top human level in backgammon.

==Connectionism vs. computationalism debate==
As connectionism became increasingly popular in the late 1980s, some researchers (including Jerry Fodor, Steven Pinker and others) reacted against it. They argued that connectionism, as then developing, threatened to obliterate what they saw as the progress being made in the fields of cognitive science and psychology by the classical approach of computationalism. Computationalism is a specific form of cognitivism that argues that mental activity is computational, that is, that the mind operates by performing purely formal operations on symbols, like a Turing machine. Some researchers argued that the trend in connectionism represented a reversion toward associationism and the abandonment of the idea of a language of thought, something they saw as mistaken. In contrast, those very tendencies made connectionism attractive for other researchers.

Connectionism and computationalism need not be at odds, but the debate in the late 1980s and early 1990s led to opposition between the two approaches. Throughout the debate, some researchers have argued that connectionism and computationalism are fully compatible, though full consensus on this issue has not been reached. Differences between the two approaches include the following:

* Computationalists posit symbolic models that are structurally similar to underlying brain structure, whereas connectionists engage in &quot;low-level&quot; modeling, trying to ensure that their models resemble neurological structures.
* Computationalists in general focus on the structure of explicit symbols (mental models) and syntactical rules for their internal manipulation, whereas connectionists focus on learning from environmental stimuli and storing this information in a form of connections between neurons.
* Computationalists believe that internal mental activity consists of manipulation of explicit symbols, whereas connectionists believe that the manipulation of explicit symbols provides a poor model of mental activity.
* Computationalists often posit domain specific symbolic sub-systems designed to support learning in specific areas of cognition (e.g., language, intentionality, number), whereas connectionists posit one or a small set of very general learning-mechanisms.

Despite these differences, some theorists have proposed that the connectionist architecture is simply the manner in which organic brains happen to implement the symbol-manipulation system. This is logically possible, as it is well known that connectionist models can implement symbol-manipulation systems of the kind used in computationalist models, as indeed they must be able if they are to explain the human ability to perform symbol-manipulation tasks. Several cognitive models combining both symbol-manipulative and connectionist architectures have been proposed. Among them are Paul Smolensky&#x27;s Integrated Connectionist/Symbolic Cognitive Architecture (ICS). and Ron Sun&#x27;s CLARION (cognitive architecture). But the debate rests on whether this symbol manipulation forms the foundation of cognition in general, so this is not a potential vindication of computationalism. Nonetheless, computational descriptions may be helpful high-level descriptions of cognition of logic, for example.

The debate was largely centred on logical arguments about whether connectionist networks could produce the syntactic structure observed in this sort of reasoning. This was later achieved although using fast-variable binding abilities outside of those standardly assumed in connectionist models.

Part of the appeal of computational descriptions is that they are relatively easy to interpret, and thus may be seen as contributing to our understanding of particular mental processes, whereas connectionist models are in general more opaque, to the extent that they may be describable only in very general terms (such as specifying the learning algorithm, the number of units, etc.), or in unhelpfully low-level terms. In this sense, connectionist models may instantiate, and thereby provide evidence for, a broad theory of cognition (i.e., connectionism), without representing a helpful theory of the particular process that is being modelled. In this sense, the debate might be considered as to some extent reflecting a mere difference in the level of analysis in which particular theories are framed. Some researchers suggest that the analysis gap is the consequence of connectionist mechanisms giving rise to emergent phenomena that may be describable in computational terms.

In the 2000s, the popularity of dynamical systems in philosophy of mind have added a new perspective on the debate; some authors now argue that any split between connectionism and computationalism is more conclusively characterized as a split between computationalism and dynamical systems.

In 2014, Alex Graves and others from DeepMind published a series of papers describing a novel Deep Neural Network structure called the Neural Turing Machine able to read symbols on a tape and store symbols in memory. Relational Networks, another Deep Network module published by DeepMind, are able to create object-like representations and manipulate them to answer complex questions. Relational Networks and Neural Turing Machines are further evidence that connectionism and computationalism need not be at odds.

==Symbolism vs. connectionism debate==

Smolensky&#x27;s Subsymbolic Paradigm has to meet the Fodor-Pylyshyn challenge formulated by classical symbol theory for a convincing theory of cognition in modern connectionism. In order to be an adequate alternative theory of cognition, Smolensky&#x27;s Subsymbolic Paradigm would have to explain the existence of systematicity or systematic relations in language cognition without the assumption that cognitive processes are causally sensitive to the classical constituent structure of mental representations. The subsymbolic paradigm, or connectionism in general, would thus have to explain the existence of systematicity and compositionality without relying on the mere implementation of a classical cognitive architecture. This challenge implies a dilemma: If the Subsymbolic Paradigm could contribute nothing to the systematicity and compositionality of mental representations, it would be insufficient as a basis for an alternative theory of cognition. However, if the Subsymbolic Paradigm&#x27;s contribution to systematicity requires mental processes grounded in the classical constituent structure of mental representations, the theory of cognition it develops would be, at best, an implementation architecture of the classical model of symbol theory and thus not a genuine alternative (connectionist) theory of cognition. The classical model of symbolism is characterized by (1) a combinatorial syntax and semantics of mental representations and (2) mental operations as structure-sensitive processes, based on the fundamental principle of syntactic and semantic constituent structure of mental representations as used in Fodor&#x27;s &quot;Language of Thought (LOT)&quot;. This can be used to explain the following closely related properties of human cognition, namely its (1) productivity, (2) systematicity, (3) compositionality, and (4) inferential coherence.

This challenge has been met in modern connectionism, for example, not only by Smolensky&#x27;s &quot;Integrated Connectionist/Symbolic (ICS) Cognitive Architecture&quot;, but also by Werning and Maye&#x27;s &quot;Oscillatory Networks&quot;. An overview of this is given for example by Bechtel &amp; Abrahamsen, Marcus and Maurer.

<text>Orlando International Airport is the primary international airport located southeast of downtown Orlando, Florida. In 2021, it had 19,618,838 , making it the busiest airport in the state and seventh busiest airport in the United States. The airport code MCO stands for the airport&#x27;s former name, McCoy Air Force Base, a Strategic Air Command (SAC) installation, that was closed in 1975 as part of a general military drawdown following the end of the Vietnam War.

The airport serves as a hub for Silver Airways, an operating base for Avelo Airlines, Breeze Airways, Frontier Airlines, Southwest Airlines and Spirit Airlines, as well as a focus city for JetBlue. Southwest is the airport&#x27;s largest carrier by passengers carried. The airport is also a major international gateway for the Florida region, with over 850 daily flights on 44 airlines servicing 135 domestic and international destinations. At , MCO is one of the largest commercial airports in terms of land area in the United States. In addition, the airport is home to a maintenance base for United Airlines. The airport was also a hub for Delta Air Lines until 2007.

== History ==
=== Military years ===
The airfield was originally constructed as a U.S. Army Air Forces facility and military operations began in 1942 as Orlando Army Air Field #2, an auxiliary airfield to Orlando Army Air Base, now known as Orlando Executive Airport. Orlando Army Air Field #2 was renamed Pinecastle Army Airfield in January 1943. At the end of World War II, Pinecastle was briefly used for unpowered glide tests of the Bell X-1 from B-29 aircraft before the program moved to Muroc Army Airfield in California– now Edwards AFB – for the world&#x27;s first supersonic flight. With the establishment of an independent U.S. Air Force in 1947, the airfield was briefly placed in caretaker status, until being reactivated during the Korean War as a Strategic Air Command (SAC) facility for B-47 Stratojets and KC-97 Stratofreighters and renamed Pinecastle AFB.

In the 1950s, the base began hosting SAC&#x27;s annual Bombing and Navigation Competition. A B-47 Stratojet crashed during the 1958 competition, killing Colonel Michael Norman Wright McCoy, commander of the 321st Bombardment Wing, which was the host wing for Pinecastle AFB. The following year the base was renamed for McCoy. The base later was home to the 306th Bombardment Wing operating the B-52 Stratofortress and the KC-135 Stratotanker. It was also used by EC-121 Warning Star early warning aircraft of the 966th Airborne Early Warning and Control Squadron, a tenant unit at McCoy assigned to the Aerospace Defense Command.

During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, McCoy AFB became a temporary forward operating base for more than 120 F-100 Super Sabre and F-105 Thunderchief fighter bombers and the primary base for U-2 reconnaissance aircraft flying over Cuba. One of these U-2s was shot down by Soviet-operated SA-2 Guideline surface-to-air missiles near Banes, Cuba. Its pilot, Major Rudolf Anderson Jr., USAF, was the crisis&#x27; only combat death. Following the crisis, McCoy AFB hosted a permanent U-2 operating detachment of the 100th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing until 1973.

McCoy AFB was identified for closure in early 1973 as part of a post-Vietnam reduction in force. The following year, McCoy&#x27;s 306th Bombardment Wing was inactivated, its B-52D Stratofortress and KC-135A Stratotanker aircraft reassigned to other SAC units and most of the McCoy AFB facility turned over to the city of Orlando by the General Services Administration (GSA) in late 1974 and early and mid 1975. USAF responsibility for the airfield&#x27;s air traffic control tower was turned over to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the airport established its own crash, fire and rescue department, initially utilizing equipment transferred by the GSA.

=== Civil-military years ===
In the early 1960s, when jet airline flights came to Orlando, the installation became a joint civil-military facility.

Early jetliners such as the Boeing 707, Boeing 720, Douglas DC-8 and Convair 880 required longer and sturdier runways than the ones at Herndon Airport (now Orlando Executive Airport). Nearby lakes and commercial and residential development made expansion impractical, so an agreement was reached between the City of Orlando and the United States Air Force in 1962 to use McCoy AFB under a joint arrangement. The military offered a large AGM-28 Hound Dog missile maintenance hangar and its associated flight line ramp area in the northeast corner of the field for conversion into a civil air terminal. The city would then cover the cost of building a replacement missile maintenance hangar on the main base&#x27;s western flight line. The new civil facility would be known as the Orlando Jetport at McCoy and would operate alongside McCoy AFB. This agreement became a model for other joint civil-military airports in operation today.

Airline flights to the Orlando Jetport began shortly after an agreement was signed by the city and USAF in October 1961. Over the next few years airline flights shifted from the old Herndon Airport (renamed in 1982 as the Orlando Executive Airport). In 1971 scheduled airlines were Delta Air Lines, Eastern Air Lines, National Airlines and Southern Airways. As the years progressed, many other airlines started to offer regularly scheduled flights to Orlando Executive Airport, including Spirit Airlines, Copa Air, LATAM Airlines and many more.

The 1971 opening of the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World led to a significant increase in air travel as Orlando became a major tourist destination. For much of the 1970s, Shawnee Airlines would directly link MCO with Walt Disney World using de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter commuter aircraft. These connecting flights flew from MCO to the Walt Disney World STOL Airport, a small, short-lived airfield near the Magic Kingdom&#x27;s parking lot. Deregulation of the airline industry in 1978 also contributed to increases in air service to Orlando.

When McCoy AFB closed in 1975, part of the facility stayed under military control to support Naval Training Center Orlando and several tenant commands.

There are only a few enclaves on the original McCoy AFB site that the military still uses such as the 164th Air Defense Artillery Brigade from the Florida Army National Guard in the former McCoy AFB Officers Club complex, an Army Reserve intelligence unit in the former SAC Alert Facility, the 1st Lieutenant David R. Wilson Armed Forces Reserve Center supporting multiple units of the Army Reserve, Navy Reserve and Marine Corps Reserve that was constructed in 2002, and a large Navy Exchange for active, reserve and retired military personnel and their dependents.

=== Civil years ===
In 1975, the final Air Force contingent departed McCoy AFB and the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority (GOAA) was established as a state-chartered local governmental agency and an enterprise fund of the city of Orlando. GOAA&#x27;s mission was to operate, manage and oversee construction of expansions and improvements to both the Orlando International Airport and the Orlando Executive Airport. The airport gained its current name and international airport status a year later in 1976 but retained its old IATA airport code MCO and ICAO airport code KMCO.

The airport became a U.S. Customs Service Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) in 1978, said zone being designated as FTZ #42. In 1979, the facility was also designated as a large hub airport by the FAA based on flight operations and passenger traffic.

In 1978, construction of the current Landside Terminal and two Airsides on the west side of the terminal (known today as Airsides 1 and 3) began, opening in 1981. The terminal&#x27;s layout was heavily based on the current terminal at Tampa International Airport, which opened a decade prior. In 1983 a small chapel was opened memorializing Michael Galvin who died during the construction of the airport&#x27;s expansion. The original International Concourse was housed in Airside 1 and opened in 1984. Funding to commence developing the east side of the airport was bonded in 1986, with Runway 17/35 (now 17R/35L) completed in 1989. Airside 4 opened in 1990 and also contains an International Concourse for the processing of international flights. Airside 2, which filled out what will become known as the North Terminal complex, was completed in 2000, with the last additional gates added in 2006. Runway 17L/35R was opened in 2003, providing the airport with a total of four runways.

In 1978, the airport handled 5 million passengers. By 2018, that number had risen to 47 million. Today it covers 47 square kilometers (18.1 sq mi) and is the fifth-largest airport in the United States by land area after Denver International Airport which covers 136 square kilometers (52.4 sq mi), Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport which covers 70 square kilometers (26.9 sq mi), Southwest Florida International Airport which covers 55 square kilometers (21.2 sq mi), and Washington Dulles International Airport which covers 53 square kilometers (20.3 sq mi). MCO has North America&#x27;s fourth tallest control tower at 345 feet, replacing two earlier Air Force and FAA control towers.

Orlando was a designated Space Shuttle emergency landing site. The west-side runways, Runway 18L/36R and Runway 18R/36L, were designed for B-52 Stratofortress bombers, and due to their proximity to NASA&#x27;s John F. Kennedy Space Center, were an obvious choice for an emergency landing should an emergency return to launch site (RTLS) attempt to land at KSC have fallen short. The runway was also an emergency divert site for NASA&#x27;s Boeing 747 Shuttle Transport Aircraft when relocating orbiters from either west coast modification work or divert recoveries at Edwards AFB, California or the White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.

Eastern Air Lines used Orlando as a focus city during the 1970s and early 1980s, and became &quot;the official airline of Walt Disney World.&quot; Following Eastern&#x27;s demise, Delta Air Lines assumed this role.

Delta Air Lines began operating a hub at MCO in 1987. Airside 4, which opened in 1990, was primarily designed for Delta&#x27;s hub operation and it included a ramp tower, an international arrivals facility, and a wing for regional aircraft under the people mover guideway. Delta would later pull much of its large aircraft from its hub operations and focused its service there on regional flights via their Delta Connection affiliate Comair. Comair operated intra-Florida flights as well as flights to other southeastern cities and to the Caribbean. In 2002, Chautauqua Airlines replaced Comair as the primary Delta Connection carrier at MCO. Delta closed the Orlando hub entirely in 2007.

Orlando-based AirTran Airways also operated a hub at MCO from 1993 to 2014. After Delta closed their hub in 2007, AirTran relocated their hub to Airside 4, using some of Delta&#x27;s former gates which allowed them to double their capacity. AirTran merged with Southwest Airlines in 2014, which is today the busiest carrier at MCO.

Saudi Arabian Airlines began service to Orlando in 1994. Its seasonal flights to Jeddah proved popular among Saudi tourists. Bookings declined after the September 11 attacks, however, so Saudi Arabian terminated the link.

On February 22, 2005, the airport became the first airport in Florida to accept E-Pass and SunPass toll transponders as a form of payment for parking. The system allows drivers to enter and exit a parking garage without pulling a ticket or stopping to pay the parking fee. The two toll roads that serve the airport, SR 528 (Beachline Expressway) and SR 417 (Central Florida GreeneWay), use these systems for automatic toll collection.

The original terminal building, a converted hangar, was described as inadequate for the task at hand even when it was first opened as Orlando Jetport. After its closure in 1981, it passed through several tenants, the last of which was UPS. It was demolished in May 2006.

On February 1, 2010, Allegiant Air began operations at the airport. The company moved one half of its schedule from its operating base at nearby Orlando Sanford International Airport (SFB) to MCO to test revenue at the higher cost airport. After evaluating the routes out of Orlando, the carrier decided to consolidate and return its Orlando area operations to SFB citing an inability to achieve a fare premium at MCO as anticipated, passenger preference for SFB, higher costs at MCO than expected and a more efficient operating environment at SFB. Allegiant Air resumed operating some flights at MCO in 2024.

In March 2015, Emirates announced that they would begin daily service to the airport from Dubai International Airport beginning September 1, 2015. The airport had tried to attract Emirates for five years before the service was announced. Orlando International was the first airport in Florida served by Emirates. The airline expects three major markets for the flights: leisure and corporate travelers along with locals of Asian heritage traveling to Asia, which is well-served by the airline. Greater Orlando Aviation Association Chair Frank Kruppenbacher called the new service &quot;without question the biggest, most significant move forward for our airport&quot; and estimates that the local economic impact of the new service will be up to $100 million annually. The inaugural flight was made with an Airbus A380. Regularly scheduled flights operate with Boeing 777-300ERs. Gate 90 was updated in the summer of 2018 with 3 jetways to be able to properly handle the A380, 3 years after the airplane first arrived at Orlando, docking at Gate 84.

In May 2016, the airport launched its own radio station, FlyMCO 105.1 HD2, a subchannel of WOMX-FM. FlyMCO 105.1 HD2 provides access to airport information, local weather, and music. In 2017, the airport reached 44.6 million passengers, surpassing Miami International Airport to become the busiest airport in the state of Florida.

The Orlando International Airport Intermodal Terminal, which was partially funded by the Florida Department of Transportation, opened in November 2017 and is connected to the Terminal A/B complex by Terminal Link, an automated people mover. The $684 million station included a new 2,500 space parking garage (which would also be the parking garage for Terminal C), and the Orlando station for the Brightline higher speed regional rail service to South Florida which began service in 2023. The station reused some of the plans of the Orlando Airport station of the now defunct Florida High Speed Rail project. 

In May 2015, the Board of the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority (GOAA) voted unanimously to approve construction of the $1.8 billion South Terminal Complex. Construction of the first phase of the South Terminal Complex, Terminal C, began in 2017. Terminal C opened on September 19, 2022 with 20 gates. Terminal C is connected to the Orlando International Airport Intermodal Terminal, which provides a connection to Terminals A/B via the Terminal Link people mover.

=== Future ===

There are plans to add an additional terminal, Terminal D, to the South Terminal Complex east of the Intermodal Terminal when the airport reaches 70 million passengers annually. The final estimated capacity of the airport is set at 100 million passengers annually when completed. When fully complete, the South Terminal Complex will have 120 gates in both terminals C and D.

The Orlando International Airport Intermodal Terminal was built to accommodate an extension of the SunRail commuter rail service. The route to the current SunRail line would travel along an Orlando Utilities Commission rail spur, before either branching off to the intermodal station, or have an intermediate transfer point on to light rail to complete the journey to this station.

Multiple options are being considered for a link to International Drive, either with elevated maglev train system, connecting the airport to the Orange County Convention Center, the Florida Mall, and the Sand Lake Road SunRail station, or a light rail link running along a similar route as the maglev alternative between the airport and International Drive.

== Facilities ==
=== Terminals ===
Orlando International Airport has 3 terminals. The North Terminal Complex consists of a large main terminal building divided into north and south sides, and four airside concourses accessible with elevated people movers, with a total of 93 gates.

*Terminal A consists of the northern half of the main terminal, with tramway systems to Airside 1 (Gates 1–29) and Airside 2 (Gates 100–129).
*Terminal B consists of the southern half of the main terminal, with tramway systems to Airside 3 (Gates 30–59), Airside 4 (Gates 70–99) and Terminal C.
*Terminal C , also known as the South Terminal Complex contains gates 230–245 with a pre-security tramway connecting to Terminals A &amp; B. Terminal C accommodates international flights by non-US airlines as well as all JetBlue flights. The terminal is also connected to the Intermodal Terminal by an elevated enclosed walkway and a shared parking garage.

=== Hotel ===
The airport features an on-site Hyatt Regency hotel within the main terminal structure. The hotel is located on the east side of the Terminal A/B complex with a fourth floor lobby level and guest rooms beginning on level five and above. The hotel features an expansive lobby area for guests awaiting flights, convention space, several bars, and two restaurants including a signature restaurant on the top level of the terminal building overlooking the airport facility and runways below.

=== Interfaith Chapel ===

In 1981, an interfaith chapel was constructed behind the security for Gates 1-59. Prior to 2019, the chapel held religious services, but this moved to a nearby hotel because of an uptick in religious violence.

==Accidents and incidents at MCO==
* On January 18, 1985, Eastern Airlines Flight 403, an Airbus A300 en route from Newark Int&#x27;l Airport to Miami Int&#x27;l Airport was hijacked by a lone male who emerged from a lavatory who claimed to have explosives in a bag and poured gasoline on himself and the floor of the aircraft shouting in Spanish that he wanted to go to Cuba. The flight was diverted to MCO and believing the plane landed in Cuba, the hijacker was overpowered by the flight crew. There were no injuries among the 132 passengers and crew.
* On June 23, 1996, a Comair Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia suffered a landing gear failure because of a loss of hydraulic pressure on approach to MCO. The aircraft performed a wheels up landing and slid 2,500 feet down the runway before the plane came to a complete stop. All 32 passengers and crew survived. The aircraft was substantially damaged but was repaired and placed back into service.
* On August 8, 2019, Frontier Airlines Flight 1187, an Airbus A321-200 suffered a tailstrike upon landing at MCO. The flight crew performed a go-around and landed successfully on their second attempt on runway 35R. There were no injuries among the 232 passengers and crew. There was reported windshear in the area at the time of the incident. The aircraft was repaired and resumed service 4 months later on December 14, 2019.
* On October 22, 2021, an Embraer Phenom 100 operated by &quot;Scout About LLC&quot; experienced a runway excursion accident upon landing at MCO. The pilot&#x27;s inadvertent application of the right brake during the landing roll caused a loss of directional control and a subsequent runway excursion. There were no injuries among the 4 occupants on board but the aircraft was substantially damaged and written off.

<text>Memphis International Airport is a civil-military airport located southeast of downtown Memphis in Shelby County, Tennessee, United States. It is the primary international airport serving Memphis. It covers and has four runways.

It is home to the FedEx Express global hub, often referred to as the FedEx Superhub or simply the Superhub, which processes many of the company&#x27;s packages. Nonstop FedEx destinations from Memphis include cities across the continental United States, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and South America.

From 1993 to 2009, Memphis International was the world’s busiest airport for cargo operations. It dropped to second place in 2010, just behind Hong Kong. It still remained the busiest cargo airport in the United States and the Western Hemisphere. It briefly rose to first place once again in 2020 due to the surge in ecommerce partly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic but dropped back to second place in 2021.

The airport averages over 80 passenger flights per day. The 164th Airlift Wing of the Tennessee Air National Guard is based at the co-located Memphis Air National Guard Base, operating C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft.

==History==

Memphis Municipal Airport, dedicated in 1929, opened on a plot of farmland just over from downtown Memphis. In its early years the airport had three hangars and an unpaved runway; passenger and air mail service was provided by American Airlines and Chicago and Southern Air Lines (acquired by Delta Air Lines in 1953). A modern terminal was built in 1938 to meet the demands for increased commercial passenger service. In 1939 Eastern Air Lines arrived; that March, Eastern had one departure a day to Muscle Shoals and beyond, American had four east/west and C&amp;S had four north/south.

During World War II the United States Army Air Forces Air Transport Command 4th Ferrying Group used Memphis while sending new aircraft overseas. In April 1951 the runways were 6000-ft 2/20, 6530-ft 9/27, 4370-ft 14/32 and 4950-ft 17/35; the airport was all north of Winchester Road during the 1950s.

The April 1957 OAG shows 64 weekday departures: 25 on Delta, 18 American, 7 Southern, 5 Eastern, 4 Braniff, 3 Trans-Texas and 2 Capital. American DC-6s flew nonstop to Washington and New York, but westward nonstops did not reach beyond Fort Worth and Kansas City until American started Los Angeles in 1964. The first scheduled jets were Delta 880s ORD-MEM-MSY and back, starting in July–August 1960.

The current terminal was designed by Mann &amp; Harrover and cost $6.5 million. It opened on June 7, 1963, and Memphis Municipal changed its name to Memphis International in 1969. In 1985–86 Republic Airlines began flights to Mexico. The terminal was expanded for $31.6 million in 1974, adding two new concourses and extending the others, which were designed by Roy P. Harrover &amp; Associates.

===Hub status===
Southern Airways was an important regional carrier at Memphis in the 1960s; it merged into Republic Airlines in 1979 as the first large merger after the passage of the Airline Deregulation Act. With the dismantling of the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) flight approval requirements, airlines began developing around a large hub model as opposed to the former point-to-point networks that were common before deregulation. Republic established Memphis as a hub operation in 1985 before merging into Northwest Airlines in 1986. Northwest operated around 300 daily flights at the peak of the hub, including international flights to Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. KLM, a partner of Northwest, launched a flight to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in June 1995. This was Memphis&#x27;s first transatlantic passenger service. The airline used McDonnell Douglas MD-11 on the route. In preparation for the flight, the airport had constructed a customs facility that cost $12.6 million. In 2003, Northwest began flying the route instead, initially with a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, and later with an Airbus A330.

Federal Express (now FedEx Express) began operations in Memphis in 1973. It opened its current &quot;SuperHub&quot; facility on the north side of the airport in 1981, and maintains a large presence to the present day.

Northwest was acquired by Delta Air Lines (which operates a large hub in Atlanta) in 2008, and Delta continued operating at Memphis as a hub, flying as many as 200 flights per day in 2009. However, the carrier discontinued the Amsterdam link in September 2012 due to high fuel prices, diminished passenger numbers, and economic challenges. Delta continued to scale back its operations at Memphis before closing the hub in 2013. Passenger traffic at the airport declined for the next several years until it bottomed out at 3.5 million in 2015.

===Recent years===
In 2014, the Memphis–Shelby County Airport Authority announced a planned $114 million renovation of the airport. This renovation included demolishing the largely vacant south ends of Concourses A and C, mothballing the remaining portions and widening and modernizing the larger Concourse B. The renovation, which was expected to start in late 2015 and end around 2020, would have left the airport with about 60 gates.

The initial project was only partly completed, with the south end of Concourse A demolished. Memphis officials decided to rethink the plans; several aspects of the project changed. The plan had called for renovating and widening Concourse B, the updated plan included a full redesign of most of the concourse. Concourse B was closed during construction, and airlines and tenants moved to Concourses A and C during that time. The southwest leg of Concourse B will be updated in a future phase, and will only be utilized in the near term for passengers from inbound international flights. The modernization began in September 2018 and was completed in February 2022.

In November 2022, Memphis opened its new $309 million consolidated de-icing facility located at the southern edge of the airport. It has capacity for 12 wide-body planes and included the construction of two new taxiway bridges and a control tower.

In 2023, the south end of Concourse C was demolished.

In October 2022, the Airport Authority revealed their revised master plan, including expansion of the landside portion of the terminal, expanding space for parking and car rentals, and runway expansions. Terminal construction will begin in summer of 2024.

*On December 17, 1944, a USAAF Douglas C-47 drifted to the right after takeoff, stalled and hit a brick storehouse. Three out of the six on board died.
*On January 13, 1963, a Delta Air Lines Douglas DC-7 struck a USAF Fairchild C-123 Provider taxiing at night. The pilot of the DC-7 was killed, and the Provider was destroyed after catching fire.
*On May 18, 1978, a Dassault Falcon 20 C operated by Flight Safety International collided with a Cessna 150 3.8 miles west of MEM, all four occupants on the Falcon and two aboard the Cessna died as both aircraft crashed.
*On August 11, 1984, Douglas C-47 N70003 of Aviation Enterprises crashed shortly after takeoff from Memphis International Airport on a domestic nonscheduled passenger flight to O&#x27;Hare International Airport, Chicago. All three people on board died. A missing spark plug on the port engine caused a loss of power. Maintenance involving the removal of the spark plugs had been performed the previous day.
*On October 8, 1987, a Volpar Turboliner II operated by Connie Kalitta Services crashed while attempting to return to MEM due to an attached tail stand. The aircraft was overweight and the cg (Center of Gravity) was three inches forward of the limit. The sole occupant died.
*On April 7, 1994, Federal Express Flight 705 bound for San Jose, California, experienced an attempted hijacking shortly after takeoff. FedEx employee Auburn Calloway tried to hijack the plane in order to crash it into the FedEx hub at Memphis International, in a Kamikaze-style attack. The crew—although seriously injured—fought him off and returned to Memphis, where police and emergency crews subdued him.
*On October 15, 2002, a Northwest Airlines Avro RJ 85 collided with the jetway at gate C2 while taxiing for a maintenance check. The mechanics were unable to slow the aircraft down in time. Due to their error, the aircraft suffered minor damage, but the number one engine was ripped almost entirely off, and the jetway. The aircraft was eventually torn apart and set in a field near the airport.
*On December 18, 2003, FedEx Express Flight 647 veered off the runway after the landing gear collapsed upon landing. The flight had departed Oakland International Airport (OAK) earlier that day. The aircraft was immediately engulfed in flames. All five crew members escaped by exiting via the cockpit window.
*On July 28, 2006, FedEx Flight 630&#x27;s landing gear collapsed upon landing at Memphis International Airport after a flight from Seattle–Tacoma International Airport.

<doc id="263642" wikidata="Q1420233" url="?curid=263642" title="Bradley International Airport">
<text>Bradley International Airport – historically known as Bradley Field – is a public international airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, United States. Owned and operated by the Connecticut Airport Authority (CAA), it is the second-largest airport in New England.

The airport is about halfway between Hartford, Connecticut, and Springfield, Massachusetts. It is the state of Connecticut&#x27;s busiest commercial airport and the second-busiest airport in New England after Boston&#x27;s Logan International Airport, with over 6.75 million passengers in 2019. The four largest carriers at Bradley International Airport are Southwest, Delta, JetBlue, and American with market shares of 29%, 19%, 15%, and 14%, respectively. As a dual-use military facility with the U.S. Air Force, the airport is home to the 103rd Airlift Wing (103 AW) of the Connecticut Air National Guard.

Bradley was originally branded as the &quot;Gateway to New England&quot; and is home to the New England Air Museum. In 2016, Bradley International launched its new brand, &quot;Love the Journey&quot;. In 2019, Bradley was the 55th-busiest commercial airport in the United States, by passengers enplaned.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021 categorized it as a medium-hub primary commercial service facility.

The former discount department store chain Bradlees was named after the airport as many of the early planning meetings were held there.

== History ==

===20th century===
Bradley has its origins in the 1940 acquisition of of land in Windsor Locks by the state of Connecticut. In 1941, this land was turned over to the U.S. Army, as the country began its preparations for the impending war.

The airfield was named after 24-year-old Lt. Eugene M. Bradley of Antlers, Oklahoma, assigned to the 64th Pursuit Squadron, who died when his P-40 crashed during a dogfight training drill on August 21, 1941.

The airfield began civil use in 1947 as Bradley International Airport. Its first commercial flight was Eastern Air Lines Flight 624. International cargo operations at the airport also began that year. Bradley eventually replaced the older, smaller Hartford–Brainard Airport as Hartford&#x27;s primary airport, then becoming Springfield&#x27;s own primary airport with the closure of the Springfield Airport in the early 1950s and the eventual build-out of Interstate 91 facilitating fast access from the airport to the downtowns of both cities.

In 1948, the federal government deeded the Airport to the State of Connecticut for public and commercial use.

In 1950, Bradley International Airport exceeded the 100,000-passenger mark, handling 108,348 passengers.
In 1952, the Murphy Terminal opened. Later dubbed Terminal B, it was the oldest passenger terminal of any major airport in the U.S. when it closed in 2010.

The April 1957 OAG shows 39 weekday departures: 14 American, 14 Eastern, 9 United, and 2 Northeast. The first jets were United 720s to Cleveland in early 1961. Nonstops never reached west of Chicago or south of Washington until Eastern and Northeast began nonstops to Miami in 1967; nonstops to Los Angeles and Atlanta started in 1968.

In 1960, Bradley handled 500,238 passengers.

In 1971, the Murphy Terminal was expanded with an International Arrivals wing. This was followed by the installation of instrument landing systems on two runways in 1977.

In 1974, construction began on an experimental People Mover to move people between the terminal and a parking lot away. It was completed in December 1975. The People Mover consisted of a 7&#x27; wide roadway and two 30&#x27; long cars. It cost US$4.5 million to construct and was anticipated to cost $250,000 annually to operate. Due to the high operating cost and the fact that the parking lot it was connected to was not being used, the system was never put in service and was dismantled in 1984 to make room for a new terminal building. The retired vehicles from the system are now on display at the Connecticut Trolley Museum in East Windsor, Connecticut.

In 1979, the Windsor Locks tornado ripped through the eastern portions of the airport. The New England Air Museum sustained some of the worst damage. It reopened in 1981.

The new Terminal A and Bradley Sheraton Hotel were completed in 1986. The Roncari cargo terminal was also built about this time.

===21st century===

2001 saw the commencement of the Terminal Improvement Project to expand Terminal A with a new concourse, construct a new International Arrivals Building and centralize passenger screening. The airport expansion was part of a larger project to enhance the reputation of the Hartford metropolitan area as a destination for business and vacation travel. The new East Concourse, designed by HNTB, opened in September 2002.

In December 2002 a new International Arrivals Building opened west of Terminal B, housing the Federal Inspection Station with one jetway. Two government agencies support the facility; U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The FIS Terminal can process more than 300 passengers per hour from aircraft as large as a Boeing 747. This facility cost approximately $7.7 million, which included the building and site work, funded through the Bradley Improvement Fund. Currently the International Arrivals Building is utilized by Avelo Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Frontier Airlines (Apple Vacations) for their seasonal service to Cancun, Mexico, Montego Bay, and Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. All international arrivals except for those from airports with customs preclearance are processed through the IAB. International departures are handled from the existing terminal complex.

In July 2007, Northwest Airlines launched a route to Amsterdam, Hartford&#x27;s first direct flight to Europe. Three months later, the Airbus A380 visited Bradley on its world tour, stopping in Hartford to showcase the aircraft to Connecticut workers for Pratt &amp; Whitney and Hamilton Sundstrand, both divisions of United Technologies, which helped build the GP7000 TurboFan engines, which is an option to power the aircraft. Bradley Airport is one of only 68 airports worldwide large enough to accommodate the A380. No carriers provide regular A380 service to Bradley, but the airport occasionally is a diversion airfield for JFK-bound A380s.

Northwest Airlines terminated its service to Amsterdam in October 2008 because of the increased cost of jet fuel. In the same month, Embraer, an aerospace company based in Brazil, selected Bradley as its service center for the Northeastern United States. An $11 million project was begun with support from teams of the Connecticut Department of Transportation and Connecticut&#x27;s Economic and Community Development. The center is intended to be a full maintenance and repair facility for its line of business jets and is expected to employ up to 60 aircraft technicians. The facility was temporarily closed ten months after opening due to economic conditions, reopening on February 28, 2011.

On October 21, 2015, Bradley announced renewed transatlantic service, partnering with Aer Lingus to bring daily flights between Bradley and Dublin. Service to Dublin began on September 28, 2016. On September 13, 2018, Governor Dannel P. Malloy announced that Aer Lingus service at Bradley International Airport will continue for at least four more years under a new agreement made with the state, committing the airline to continue its transatlantic service at the airport through September 2022. Aer Lingus committed to placing one of its first four A321LR aircraft on the Bradley to Dublin route, replacing the Boeing 757-200 assigned to the route.

On February 17, 2022, Breeze Airways announced they would be establishing an operating base at Bradley International Airport. The announcement included the airline would begin service to an additional eight nonstop destinations from Bradley and create more than 200 new jobs. On March 8, 2022, they announced service to six new destinations, Akron/Canton, Jacksonville, Nashville, Richmond, Sarasota/Bradenton and Savannah all beginning in June 2022. On July 13, 2022, the $210 million Ground Transportation Center opened, hosting a consolidated rental car facility and 830 additional general-purpose parking spaces.

=== Future ===
On July 3, 2012, the Connecticut Department of Transportation released an Environmental Assessment and Environmental Impact Evaluation, detailing a proposal to replace the now-vacant Terminal B with updates and facilities intended to improve access and ease of use for Bradley travelers. The replacement proposal called for:
* Demolition of the Murphy Terminal and existing International Arrivals Building;
* Construction of a new Terminal B, with two concourses containing a total of 19 gates, two of which could accommodate international widebody aircraft;
* Inclusion of a new Federal Inspection Services facility within the new Terminal;
* Construction of a new Central Utility Plant;
* Relocation of the Terminal B arrival roadway and departure viaduct;
* Realignment of Schoephoester Road; and
* Construction of a new 7-level parking garage and consolidated car rental facility, adding 2,600 public parking spaces and 2,250 rental car spaces.
The proposal also calls for a three-phase construction program:
* Demolition of the existing Terminal B, realignment of surface roads and construction of the new garage/rental car facility would occur during the initial phase. The initial phase is estimated to cost between $630 million and $650 million.
* Construction of part of Terminal B and its upper roadway would occur in a second phase. The original estimated completion date was 2018.
* Construction of the final segment of Terminal B and its upper roadway would occur in a third phase. The original estimated completion date was 2028.

Actual completion dates depend upon funding and demand. As of May 2018 the project had not left the planning stage.

The West Concourse has 10 gates and houses the following airlines: Air Canada, American, Breeze, United. A 2024 expansion project will see the construction of a new baggage screening facility, as well as the construction of two additional gates on the west side of the terminal – plus the relocation of the existing Gate 20 to the expanded area, for a total of three additional gates. After the renovation, BDL will have a total of 25 gates and one FIS international arrivals gate.

The Customs Building that is used for arriving international flights has been dubbed Terminal B and consists of one passenger gate.

The third floor of Terminal A has the administrative offices of the Connecticut Airport Authority.

==== Former terminal ====
Former terminal B, also known as the Murphy Terminal, opened in 1952 and was closed to passenger use in 2010. It was slowly demolished starting in late 2015 and ending in early 2016. It housed the administrative offices of the CAA and TSA until its demolition.

== Accidents and incidents ==
* On March 4, 1953, a Slick Airways Curtiss-Wright C-46 Commando N4717N on a cargo flight from New York-Idlewild Field crashed. Bradley was experiencing light rain and a low ceiling at the time of the incident. After being cleared to land on Runway 06, the pilot reported problems intercepting the localizer, and continued to circle down to get under the weather. The plane struck trees approximately southwest of the airport, killing the crew of two.
* On January 15, 1959, a USAF Douglas DC-4 impacted a wooded hillside in fog without the use of a compass during approach, the pilot survived, the co-pilot and mechanic were killed.
* On July 16, 1971, a Douglas C-47B N74844 of New England Propeller Service crashed on approach. The aircraft was on a ferry flight to Beverly Municipal Airport, Massachusetts, when an engine lost power shortly after take-off due to water in the fuel. At the time of the accident, the aircraft was attempting to return to Bradley Airport. All three occupants survived.
* On June 4, 1984, a Learjet 23 operated by Air Continental crashed on approach to runway 33 due to asymmetric retraction of the spoilers, two crew and one passenger were killed.
* On May 3, 1991, a Ryan International (wet-leased by Emery Worldwide) Boeing 727-100QC, N425EX, caught fire during take-off. The take-off was aborted and the three crew members escaped while the aircraft was destroyed by the fire. The fire was determined to have started in the number 3 engine. It was determined that the 9th stage HP compressor had ruptured.
* On November 12, 1995, American Airlines Flight 1572 crashed while trying to land at Bradley. The plane, a McDonnell Douglas MD-83, was substantially damaged when it impacted trees while on approach to runway 15 at Bradley International Airport. The airplane also impacted an instrument landing system antenna as it landed short of the runway on grassy, even terrain. The cause of the accident was determined to be the pilot&#x27;s failure to reset the altimeter, however, severe weather may have played a factor. One of the 78 passengers and five crew on board were injured.
* On January 21, 1998, a Continental Express ATR-42, N15827, had an emergency during roll on landing. During the landing roll, a fire erupted in the right engine. The airplane was stopped on the runway, the engines were shut down and the occupants evacuated. The fire handles for both engines were pulled and both fire bottles on the right engine discharged. However, the fire in the right engine continued to burn. The airport fire services attended shortly afterward and extinguished the fire.
* On October 2, 2019, a vintage Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress owned by the Collings Foundation carrying three crew and ten passengers crashed into deicing tanks and a shed while attempting an emergency landing and caught fire. Seven deaths and seven injuries were reported including one person injured on the ground. Witnesses reported that an engine failed upon takeoff and then the aircraft circled back at low altitude.

<text>Each winner of the 1987 Governor General&#x27;s Awards for Literary Merit received $5000 and a medal from the Governor General of Canada. The winners and nominees were selected by a panel of judges administered by the Canada Council for the Arts.

The Governor General&#x27;s Awards for Literary Merit nominally increased in number from 8 in 1986 to 14 in 1987, with the addition of four awards for children&#x27;s book writing and illustration and two awards for translation. The four Children&#x27;s Literature awards, however, were simply the four annual Canada Council Children&#x27;s Literature Prizes (1975 to 1986) under a new name.

<text>Denver International Airport , often referred to by locals as DIA, is an international airport in the Western United States, primarily serving metropolitan Denver, Colorado, as well as the greater Front Range Urban Corridor. At , it is the largest airport in the Western Hemisphere by land area and the second largest on Earth, behind King Fahd International Airport. Runway 16R/34L, with a length of , is the longest public use runway in North America and the seventh longest on Earth. The airport is driving distance northeast of Downtown Denver, farther than the former Stapleton International Airport which DEN replaced; the airport is actually closer to the City of Aurora than central Denver, and many airport-related services, such as hotels, are located in Aurora.

Opened in 1995, in 2018 DEN served 25 different airlines offering non-stop service to over 215 destinations throughout the Americas, Europe, and Asia; it was the fourth airport in the U.S. to exceed 200 destinations. The airport is a major hub for United Airlines and the largest operating base for both Frontier Airlines and Southwest Airlines. With over 40,000 employees, the airport is the largest employer in Colorado. The airport is located on the western edge of the Great Plains and within sight of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains.

In both 2021 and 2022, DEN was the third busiest airport in the world as well as the third busiest airport in the United States by passenger traffic. In 2023, it was the sixth busiest airport in the world and remained the third busiest airport in the United States having served around 77.8 million passengers, more than a 12% increase from the prior year. DEN has been among the top 20 busiest airports in the world every year since 2000.

In 2024, Denver Int&#x27;l Airport set an all-time passenger record, with 82,358,744 passengers served, up 5.8% over the previous record set in 2023.

==History==
Denver has traditionally been home to one of the busier airports in the United States because its midcontinent location was ideal for an airline hub. Several airlines, notably United Airlines and Continental Airlines, had hubs at the former Stapleton International Airport, helping make it the sixth-busiest airport in the country by the 1960s. However, Stapleton had little room to add more flights and its runways were too close together, which led to long delays and nationwide travel disruptions in bad weather.

From 1980 to 1983, the Denver Regional Council of Governments investigated areas for a new area airport north and east of Denver. Meanwhile, in 1983, Federico Peña was elected mayor of Denver, campaigning on a plan to expand Stapleton onto Rocky Mountain Arsenal lands. The plan had broad support, but leaders in nearby Adams County threatened to sue over noise concerns.

Eventually Peña struck a deal: Adams County leaders would rally citizens to back a plan for Denver to annex of the county to build an airport away from established neighborhoods. In 1988, Adams County voters approved the annexation. The proposal was met with some skepticism because of its location: from the heart of the city. But seeing the importance of a Denver air hub to the national transportation system, the federal government put $500 million (equivalent to $ billion ) toward the new airport. The rest of the cost would be financed by bonds, to be repaid with fees on airlines. Ground was broken in September 1989.

Two years later, Mayor Wellington Webb inherited the megaproject, which at that time was scheduled to open on October 29, 1993. At the time United was refusing to move to the new airport over the high proposed fees. The airline finally relented under the condition that the airport include an automated baggage system.

Construction delays pushed opening day back, first to December 1993, then to March 1994. By September 1993, delays due to a millwright strike and other events meant opening day was pushed back again to May 1994.

In April 1994, the city invited reporters to observe the first test of the new automated baggage system. Reporters were treated to scenes of clothing and other personal effects scattered beneath the system&#x27;s tracks and carts that would often toss the luggage right off the system. After the embarrassing preview, the mayor cancelled the planned May opening. The baggage system continued to be a maintenance hassle and was finally terminated in September 2005, with traditional baggage handlers manually handling cargo and passenger luggage.

DEN finally replaced Stapleton on February 28, 1995, 16 months behind schedule and at a cost of $4.8 billion (equivalent to $ billion ), nearly $2 billion over budget ($ billion ). The construction employed 11,000 workers. United Airlines Flight 1062 to Kansas City International Airport was the first to depart DEN and United Flight 1474 from Colorado Springs Airport was the first to arrive at the new airport.
In September 2003, runway 16R/34L was added, the airport&#x27;s sixth and at , it is longer than the other runways. Its length, exceeded by only six other runways in the world, allows fully laden Airbus A380s and Boeing 747-8s to take off in the hot and high conditions at the airport, which is roughly above sea level.

During a blizzard on March 17–19, 2003, the weight of heavy snow tore a hole in the terminal&#x27;s white fabric roof, and over of snow on paved areas closed the airport and its main access road (Peña Boulevard) for almost two days, stranding several thousand people. Another blizzard on December 20–21, 2006, dumped over of snow in about 24 hours. The airport was closed for more than 45 hours, stranding thousands. Following this, the airport invested heavily in new snow-removal equipment that has led to a dramatic reduction in runway occupancy times to clear snow, down from an average of 45 minutes in 2006 to just 15 minutes. In 2020, the airport was awarded the Balchen/Post award, which is presented by the Northeast Chapter of the American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE) for the outstanding snow and ice removal operation during difficult winter conditions.

After shunning DEN for over a decade for its high fees, Southwest Airlines entered the airport in January 2006 with 13 daily flights. Southwest has since rapidly expanded and is now the airport&#x27;s second-largest carrier after United.

On November 19, 2015, a Westin hotel was added to the airport and on April 22, 2016, DEN received commuter rail service to Denver Union Station with the opening of RTD&#x27;s A Line.

On September 9, 2015, a political campaign was launched by Mayor Michael Hancock to radically expand commercial development at DEN, previously prohibited by intergovernmental agreement between Denver and Adams County. The changes to the agreement were approved by both Denver and Adams County voters in November 2015.

In 2018, work began on a major interior renovation and reconfiguration to the entire Jeppesen Terminal including the beginning phases of construction to relocate two out of the three TSA security checkpoints from the Great Hall on Level 5 to Level 6 (East &amp; West) while simultaneously updating and consolidating airline ticket counters/check-in for all airlines. Eventually, both pre- and post-security gathering and leisure areas will be incorporated into the spaces where both expansive TSA security areas on Level 5 are currently located. The third TSA security checkpoint currently accessible via the Concourse A bridge is expected to be removed once the new Level 6 security areas are completed. The renovation and reconfiguration will bring back the original intent and use of the Great Hall as a large commons area for airport patrons and visitors to enjoy. First phases of completion—including updated check-in and baggage drop counters for United &amp; Southwest Airlines as well as visual and facility updates to parts of the terminal—began in late 2020 and progressively continue to this day. In early February 2024, the first of two new security screening areas (West Security on Level 6) opened to the public. It is located directly north of the new United Airlines Check-In facilities. The new East Security, directly across the Great Hall from West, is expected to open in mid to late 2025. At that time both Level 5 North &amp; South Security areas (which have been in operation for over 20 years) are planned to be closed and removed in addition to the A-Bridge Security. , the phased terminal project was expected to be completed by 2028.

Additionally in 2018, work commenced on a major gate expansion to all three concourses with 12 new gates being added to A (including several single and double-jetway gates with direct access to U.S. Customs and Border Protection), 11 to B, and 16 to C, for a total of 39 new gates. Following the completion of the project in 2020, United Airlines made plans to lease 24 additional gates on both A and B (which would bring its total gate count at DEN to around 90), as well as build a new United Club in Concourse A and expand their existing clubs in B. Southwest Airlines leased 16 of the new gates in C bringing its total gate count at DEN to 40, which is SWA&#x27;s largest gate count at any single airport. By November 2022, all new gates in A-West, B-West, B-East and C-East were in use. New retail and restaurant tenants continued to open through 2024, as well as new art that will be commissioned and installed through 2025. Additionally, all existing way-finding signs, flight information display systems and gate signs were replaced after 2017 matching what is found at the new gates and within the renovated portions of the terminal. When both the ongoing terminal and concourse projects are completed, the airport will be able to handle upwards of 100 million passengers per year.

On August 20, 2021, the airport experienced a mechanical failure of its train system that caused significant delays. In response, a request for information from the private sector was issued to analyze options to possibly supplement the train system in the future. By 2023, several companies proposed their ideas to transport passengers.

In 2022, a committee was formed to support efforts to establish flights between Denver and Africa.

In August 2022, DEN broke ground on an additional gate expansion project that would bring a total of 14 ground-loaded/tarmac gates to the east end of Concourse A to be used solely for Frontier Airlines operations. Originally constructed in 2018 as temporary regional gates for United Airlines, this A-East wing was vacated by United earlier in 2022, making way for the renovation and expansion of the Frontier gates. It is intended to be removed once a more permanent A-East expansion (similar to what recently opened in A-West) occurs at an unknown future date. The renovated and expanded Concourse A-East wing officially opened summer 2024 and resulted in a gain of four gates for Frontier Airlines.

In December 2023 DEN started construction on a new &#x27;Center of Equity and Excellence in Aviation&#x27; which will help under-served communities and prepare current and future employees for a career in aviation. The CEEA will be located directly below the Westin Hotel and DEN Plaza and is expected to open in late 2024 or early 2025.

In late 2023, the airport laid out preliminary plans to add four new concourses with 100 more gates east and west of the terminal by 2045. The project is being referred to as &#x27;Operation 2045&#x27; and will help support the airport&#x27;s goal of serving over 125 million passengers annually by that time.

==Facilities==
The airport is from Downtown Denver, which is farther away than Stapleton International Airport, the airport DEN replaced.

The of land occupied by DEN is the largest amount of commercial airport land area in North America, by a great extent. The land was transferred from Adams County to Denver after a 1989 vote, increasing the city&#x27;s size by 50 percent and bifurcating the western portion of the neighboring county. All freeway traffic accessing the airport from central Denver leaves the city and passes through Aurora for nearly , making the airport a practical exclave. Similarly, the A Line rail service connecting the airport with downtown Denver has two intervening stations in Aurora.

===Terminal===

DEN has one terminal, named the Jeppesen Terminal after aviation safety pioneer Elrey Borge Jeppesen, and three midfield concourses, spaced far apart. The three midfield concourses have a total of 169 gates in operation as of early 2025. Concourse A is accessible via a pedestrian bridge directly from the terminal building, as well as via the underground train system that services all three concourses. For access to Concourses B and C, passengers must utilize the train. All international arrivals without border pre-clearance are processed in Concourse A; this concourse also has four 3-jetway international gates that can support ADG Group VI aircraft such as an Airbus A380 and a Boeing 747-8, the two largest commercial aircraft in the world.

*Concourse A is used by Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, United Airlines (including all international arrivals), and all international carriers. It has 60 gates, including several ground-level boarding and double jetway gates.
*Concourse B is solely used for United Airlines flights. It has 72 gates, including four double jetways and several regional gates.
*Concourse C is primarily used for Southwest Airlines flights, as well as American Airlines, Alaska Airlines, and most regional airliner flights. It has 47 gates, including four ground-level boarding gates.
In 2023, the airport announced a plan to significantly increase its passenger capacity by expanding the Jeppesen Terminal by 2045 with additional check-in and TSA counters. The plan would also add new concourses with a further 100 gates.

===Art and aesthetics===
The Jeppesen Terminal&#x27;s internationally recognized peaked roof, designed by Fentress Bradburn Architects, resembles snow-capped mountains and evokes the early history of Colorado when Native American teepees were located across the Great Plains. The catenary steel cable system, similar to the Brooklyn Bridge design, supports the fabric roof. DEN is also known for a pedestrian bridge connecting the terminal to Concourse A that allows travelers to walk from the main Terminal to Concourse A, while viewing planes taxiing beneath them. It offers views of the Rocky Mountains to the west and the high plains to the east.

Denver&#x27;s public art program (which is financed by a mandatory 1% capital improvement budget) has resulted in a significant number of artworks being installed at the airport. The artwork includes sculptures, murals, photos, sound art and paintings.

The airport features a bronze statue of Denver native Jack Swigert by Loveland, Colorado artist George Lundeen in Concourse B. Swigert flew on Apollo 13 as Command Module Pilot, and was elected to the House of Representatives in 1982, but died of cancer before he was sworn in. The statue is dressed in an A7L pressure suit, and is posed holding a gold-plated helmet. It is a duplicate of a statue placed at the United States Capitol in 1997. George Lundeen is also the sculptor of &quot;The Aviator&quot;, a monumental bronze sculpture of Elrey Borge Jeppesen, for whom the terminal is named.

Denver International Airport has four murals by the Chicano artist Leo Tanguma. &quot;Children of the World Dream of Peace&quot; is in two-parts. The first depicts the horrors of war, with a man in a gas-mask brandishing a saber. The second, larger part shows this man toppled, and smiling children from many nations making swords into plowshares; Tanguma explains this is a reference to the Book of Isaiah 2:4:...and they shall beat their swords into plowshares—nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. Per Denver Public Art:&quot;Children of the World Dream of Peace&quot; is a powerful mural expressing the artist&#x27;s desire to abolish violence in society. One section of the piece speaks to the tragedy and devastation of war and its impact on humanity. The mural then moves on to images of smiling children, dressed in traditional folk costumes from around the world, celebrating peace prevailing over war.&quot;In Peace and Harmony With Nature&quot; is also in two parts; Denver Public Art explains that:The first half of the mural shows children displaying great sadness over the destruction and extinction of life, as the second half of the artwork depicts humanity coming together to rehabilitate and celebrate nature.Tanguma confirms this was his intent.

In March 2019, the airport unveiled an animated, talking gargoyle in the middle of one of the concourses. The gargoyle interacted with passengers and joked about the supposed conspiracies connected to the airport.

&quot;Blue Mustang&quot;, by El Paso-born artist Luis Jiménez, was one of the earliest public art commissions for Denver International Airport in 1993. The sculpture is a bright blue cast-fiberglass sculpture of a horse with glowing red eyes located between the inbound and outbound lanes of Peña Boulevard. Jiménez was killed in 2006 at age 65 while creating the sculpture when a part of it fell on him and severed an artery in his leg. At the time of his death, Jiménez had completed painting the head of the mustang. &quot;Blue Mustang&quot; was completed by others, and unveiled at the airport on February 11, 2008. The statue has been the subject of considerable controversy, and has acquired the nickname &quot;Blucifer&quot; for its demonic appearance.

===Ground transportation===

The Regional Transportation District (RTD) operates the A Line rail service between DEN and Denver Union Station in downtown Denver, making the 37 minute trip about every 15 minutes. RTD also operates an airport express bus service called skyRide between Arapahoe County or Boulder and DEN. There is also hourly service to Thornton on RTD route 104L, a limited stop bus. The airport is also served by two commuter routes with just a few runs per day: RTD route 145X to Brighton and 169L to Aurora.

Scheduled bus service is also available to points such as Fort Collins, and van services stretch into Nebraska, Wyoming, and Colorado summer and ski resort areas. Amtrak offers a Fly-Rail plan for ticketing with United Airlines for trips into scenic areas in the Western U.S. via a Denver stopover.

The airport is connected to I-70 and Denver via the Peña Boulevard freeway. A number of car rental companies are located at the airport, providing courtesy shuttle services from Jeppesen Terminal Level 5, Island 4, to their parking areas.

The airport claims that it is completely accessible to bicycling travelers. The city of Denver&#x27;s designated bike route consists of the non-separated shoulders of the 65-mph Peña Boulevard freeway, a route which Denver&#x27;s former bicycle planner James Mackay has called &quot;a facade, an appearance, a deceit, a contrivance.&quot; The airport suggests that cyclists who prefer a less-traveled route may use 56th Avenue to Valleyhead Road, a rural 55-mph highway with no shoulder.

==Conspiracy theories== 
Conspiracies concerning the airport, inspired by the type of art, unusual architecture, and construction problems, started shortly after its completion. With the expansion of the internet, television shows such as &quot;Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura&quot;, and annual media reporting of these theories, they continued to grow. Airport administration decided to embrace the conspiracy theories instead of trying to fight them. In 2016, a small &quot;Conspiracy Theories Uncovered&quot; exhibition was installed in the terminal, explaining some of the more popular theories. In 2019, an animatronic gargoyle named Gregoriden, or Greg for short, that randomly makes statements such as &quot;welcome to Illuminati headquarters&quot; was installed. Some took offense to the gargoyle, claiming it was satanic, so the gargoyle was removed and replaced with a more muted version. Other gargoyle statues, sitting on open suitcases, are in the baggage claim area. Some also view these statues as malevolent, despite their intended purpose as playful artistic creations that are claimed to safeguard luggage.

In April 2019, the Roswell International Air Center and Denver International Airport became &quot;supernatural sister airports.&quot; In the agreement, they would work together to enhance industry best practices that involve commerce, trade and tourism. It also includes a clause that they would share strategies for extraterrestrial combat. For the airport&#x27;s 20th birthday, plans to decorate the airport property with crop circles proved to be too expensive, so they were not implemented. In a marketing campaign that was tied to renovations started in 2018, posters were created with aliens joking that breeding grounds for gargoyles or meeting halls for Freemasons were being constructed. The campaign was successful, generating over $8 million in revenue.

===Theories===
*Tunnels: The delay in opening the airport and the large budget overrun led to a variety of rumors about the tunnels that were built under the airport. The scope has been exaggerated, and there is lore that the tunnels lead to underground survival bunkers for the rich and elite, military bases, homes for aliens, homes for lizard people, or to the North American Aerospace Defense Command. The actual use for the tunnels is to move luggage between check-in counters, airplanes and baggage claim areas. Employees have been known to prank the media by wearing lizard masks. Videos of blurry lizard people have appeared online and drawings of aliens have appeared on tunnel walls. However, other graffiti, besides alien drawings, exist along the tunnels.
*New World Order and other secret societies: Because of the isolated location, there are rumors that the airport will be used by the New World Order as a prison or concentration camp. The time capsule at the airport showcases an inscribed plaque that has the Freemason symbol and the words &quot;New World Airport Commission,&quot; which is a group that has never existed, prompting the conspiracy theory that the airport is controlled by Freemasons and linked to the New World Order or other secret societies. A spokesperson for the Denver International Airport, Alex Renteria, has said that the Freemasons had created the cover, and thus had included their symbol, but there is no evidence that they have any influence in running the airport. The wording about the commission was used to represent that the new airport would permit access to the world and is a reference to Dvorák&#x27;s New World Symphony.
*Nazism: Tanguma&#x27;s murals have been purported to represent Nazism, death, or a prophecy of the end of the world, counter to the artist&#x27;s meaning. The removal of the murals to keep them safe during construction prompted rumors that the project was an excuse to cover the truth. In addition, there are conspiracy theories around Nazism based on the supposedly swastika-shaped runway arrangement, which aerial views refute.
*Alien languages: People have noted apparent markings that are supposed to represent alien or secret languages. The markings are actually Navajo language characters and identifiers for the airport artists.
*Blue Mustang eyes: The red, glowing eyes have led some to call the horse statue demonic, thinking that the glowing eyes are referencing the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The eyes are actually a tribute to the artist&#x27;s father, who owned a neon light shop in Mexico. 
*Flat Earth: On TikTok in April 2023, a video went viral, claiming that an artistic 30-year-old world map art installation was new and confirmed flat earth theory.

==Accidents and incidents==

* On February 16, 2007, 14 aircraft suffered windshield failures within a three-and-a-half-hour period at the airport. A total of 26 windshields on these aircraft failed. The NTSB opened an investigation, determining that foreign object damage was the cause, possibly the sharp sand used earlier that winter for traction purposes combined with wind gusts of .
* On December 20, 2008, a Continental Airlines Boeing 737-500 operating as Flight 1404 to Houston–Intercontinental Airport veered off the left side of runway 34R and caught fire during its takeoff roll at DEN. There were 38 injuries sustained by the passengers and crew; however, there were no fatalities. There was no snow or ice on the runway, however there were crosswinds at the time of the accident. On July 13, 2010, the NTSB published that the probable cause of this accident was the captain&#x27;s cessation of right rudder input, which was needed to maintain directional control of the airplane.
* On April 3, 2012, an ExpressJet Embraer ERJ-145, registration N15973, operating as Flight UA/EV-5912 from Peoria, IL to Denver, was landing on 34R when the aircraft hit the approach lights and stopped on the runway. Smoke developed inside the aircraft and passengers were evacuated onto the runway. One passenger was taken to a hospital for treatment of his injuries.
* On February 20, 2021, United Airlines Flight 328, a Boeing 777-200 that was on its way from Denver to Honolulu, Hawaii, suffered engine damage just after takeoff and had to return to Denver International Airport. Debris from the damaged engine fell on a neighborhood in Broomfield, a city around 25 miles from the airport. The damaged airplane landed safely on runway 26 and no injuries were reported.
