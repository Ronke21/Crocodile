<text>The Atlanta Flames were a professional ice hockey team based in Atlanta from 1972 until 1980. They played home games in the Omni Coliseum and were members of the West and later Patrick divisions of the National Hockey League (NHL). Along with the New York Islanders, the Flames were created in 1971 as part of the NHL&#x27;s conflict with the rival World Hockey Association (WHA). The team enjoyed modest success on the ice, qualifying for the playoffs in six of its eight seasons, but failed to win a playoff series and won only two post-season games total. The franchise struggled to draw fans and, after averaging only 10,000 per game by the 1979–80 season was sold and relocated to Alberta to become the Calgary Flames.

Eric Vail was the Flames&#x27; top goal scorer with 174 while Tom Lysiak led with 431 points. Guy Chouinard was the lone player to score 50 goals in one season. Goaltender Dan Bouchard led the team in wins (166) and shutouts (20). Two Flames players won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s top rookie: Vail in 1974–75 and Willi Plett in 1975–76. Bob MacMillan won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy as the most gentlemanly player in 1978–79. General manager Cliff Fletcher is the lone member of the Atlanta team to be named to the Hockey Hall of Fame.

==History==
===Formation===

The National Hockey League (NHL), which had grown from six teams in 1966 to fourteen in 1970, had not planned further expansion until at least 1973. However, the 1971 formation of a rival major league—the World Hockey Association (WHA)—altered the NHL&#x27;s plans and resulted in the two leagues battling for players and markets. The NHL sought to keep the WHA out of the newly constructed Nassau Coliseum in Long Island, New York. The league also opted to place a team in the American South. The NHL announced on November 9, 1971, that it was expanding to Long Island and Atlanta. The Atlanta franchise was awarded to Atlanta real estate developer Tom Cousins, who also owned the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association (NBA), and would play out of the newly built Omni Coliseum. The team cost $6 million. Cousins named the franchise the Flames in homage to the burning of Atlanta by United States Army General William Sherman during the American Civil War.

The Flames hired Cliff Fletcher, formerly of the St. Louis Blues, to serve as the team&#x27;s general manager. Former Montreal Canadiens player Bernie Geoffrion was hired as the team&#x27;s head coach. The team stocked its roster via an expansion draft held on June 6, 1972. Fletcher focused on goaltending, choosing Phil Myre with his first selection and rookie Dan Bouchard with his second. Fletcher drafted a competent roster, but one that was young and inexperienced. Two days later, the Flames selected Jacques Richard as the second overall pick in the 1972 NHL amateur draft.

===1972–1975===
The Flames made their NHL debut in Long Island against their expansion cousins, the New York Islanders, on October 7, 1972. They won the game 3–2; Morris Stefaniw scored the first goal in franchise history and the first NHL goal in Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. The team made its home debut one week later on October 14. Hosting the first event in Omni Coliseum history, the Flames tied the Buffalo Sabres, 1–1, before a sellout crowd of 14,568. The team was respectable through much of the season on the strength of Bouchard and Myre&#x27;s goaltending performances, and by mid-January, had a 20–19–8 win–loss–tie record. The Flames won only five more games through the rest of the season, finishing at 25–38–15. Atlanta finished in seventh place in the West Division and missed the playoffs. The team was reasonably successful at the gate: it sold nearly 7,000 season tickets by the start of the season, and averaged 12,516 fans per game.

Tom Lysiak, selected second overall at the 1973 NHL amateur draft, joined the Flames for the 1973–74 season and made an immediate impact. Lysiak led the Flames in scoring with 64 points and finished second to the Islanders&#x27; Denis Potvin in voting for the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s top rookie. Improving to 30–34–14, the Flames finished fourth in the West and qualified for the 1974 Stanley Cup playoffs. They made their post-season debut against the division-winning Philadelphia Flyers. The first game, played April 9, 1974, was a 4–1 victory for the Flyers. Philadelphia went on to defeat the Flames in their best-of-seven series with four consecutive wins. Geoffrion was praised for his coaching of the club and finished second in voting for the Jack Adams Award as top coach.

The NHL&#x27;s expansion to 18 teams in 1974–75 resulted in realignment. The league moved to a four division format, placing the Flames in the Patrick Division. Lysiak repeated as the Flames&#x27; top scorer with 77 points while Eric Vail, playing his first full season, led with 39 goals. Vail&#x27;s total led all rookies and earned him the Calder Trophy. The team overcame an eight-game losing streak in December and injuries to several key players to post their first winning season with a 34–31–15 record. However, they finished fourth in the Patrick Division and failed to qualify for the post-season. Citing personal reasons, Geoffrion resigned as head coach late in the season. He was replaced by Fred Creighton, who had been coaching the Flames&#x27; minor league affiliate, the Omaha Knights. Fletcher later credited Geoffrion&#x27;s outgoing personality as being the primary reason why people in Atlanta followed the Flames in the franchise&#x27;s first seasons while the team&#x27;s players later stated an appreciation for Creighton&#x27;s more technical coaching and teaching style.

===1975–1980===

Creighton produced a consistent, but not outstanding team, as the Flames finished third in the Patrick for the following three seasons and typically won a few games more than they lost each year. The team qualified for the playoffs all three years, but lost in the preliminary round each time. In 1975–76, they were defeated by the Los Angeles Kings in a best of three series, two games to none. The Kings again eliminated the Flames in 1976–77, but Atlanta earned its first playoff victory in franchise history in the second game of the series. Vail scored the game-winning goal in a 3–2 victory over the Kings on April 7, 1977, but the Flames were eliminated in the third game. Willi Plett, who was selected 80th overall in the 1975 draft, emerged as a young star for the Flames. He scored 33 goals in his rookie season in 1976–77 and won the Calder Trophy.

Seeking to improve his team&#x27;s fortunes, Fletcher made several moves over the following seasons to rework the Flames roster. His goaltending tandem of Bouchard and Myre had begun to feud with each other by the 1977–78 season as both sought more playing time. Fletcher responded by naming Bouchard his number one goaltender and trading Myre to the St. Louis Blues for three players. They made it into the playoffs again but were the only team to fall to a team with fewer points than them, the Detroit Red Wings, in a best-of-three series, two games to none. In March 1979, Fletcher completed an eight player trade that sent franchise-leading scorer Tom Lysiak and four players to the Chicago Black Hawks for three players, led by defenseman Phil Russell. Fletcher hoped the addition of Russell would help his team achieve playoff success.

Buoyed by a franchise record ten-game winning streak in October 1978, the 1978–79 Flames posted the best record in their Atlanta years at 41–31–8. Bob MacMillan, acquired in the Myre deal, became the first Flame other than Lysiak to lead the team in scoring in six years and, along with Guy Chouinard, was one of the first two Flames&#x27; players to score 100 points in one season. Chouinard also became the team&#x27;s first 50-goal scorer. MacMillan won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy that season as the NHL&#x27;s most gentlemanly player. In the playoffs against the Toronto Maple Leafs, Atlanta again failed to win a game as they lost a best of three series two games to none.

Fletcher continued to alter his team&#x27;s make-up throughout the 1979–80. Al MacNeil replaced Creighton as head coach prior to the season, and the team acquired Swedish star Kent Nilsson following the demise of the WHA. Nilsson led Atlanta in scoring with 40 goals and 53 assists. At the 1979 NHL entry draft, Fletcher selected four players – Paul Reinhart, Jim Peplinski, Pat Riggin and Tim Hunter – who would ultimately become regulars in the Flames line up. However, while the Flames again qualified for the playoffs in 1980, they again lost in the first round, losing a best-of-five series to the New York Rangers three games to one.

===Relocation===

As the team stagnated on the ice, the Flames struggled at the gate. They peaked at an average of 14,161 fans per game in their second season, 1973–74, but fell to 12,258 three years later and then 10,500 in 1977–78. Concerns that low attendance could result in the relocation of the team surfaced by 1976, prompting politicians and the players themselves to purchase tickets in a bid to stabilize the franchise. The Flames attempted to boost attendance in 1980 by signing Jim Craig, goaltender of the American Olympic team that had won the Olympic gold medal following its &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot; victory over the Soviet Union. It was not successful as attendance fell to an average of 10,024. Adding to the Flames&#x27; financial woes was the fact that the Omni Coliseum was one of the last major arenas in North America to be built without revenue-generating luxury suites, which led Fletcher to describe the facility as being &quot;out-of-date when it opened&quot;.

Cousins announced he was seeking to sell the club following the Flames&#x27; exit from the playoffs. Their final game, a 5–2 loss against the New York Rangers, was played in Atlanta on April 12, 1980. He claimed to have suffered significant financial losses on the team while low viewership hampered his ability to sign a television contract. Additionally, the real estate crunch of the 1970s hit Cousins especially hard. Most of his money not tied up in his real estate interests was tied up in the Flames, leading him to put the Flames on the market. The Flames, estimated to have lost $12 million in its eight years, had been rumored for months to be moving to Calgary, though Dallas and Houston were also mentioned as possible destinations. Dallas got an NHL team in 1993, when the erstwhile Minnesota North Stars relocated to the city to become the Dallas Stars.

The Seaman brothers, Daryl and Byron, had made an offer of $14 million while the City of Calgary prepared to build a new arena for the team. However, Canadian businessman Nelson Skalbania emerged as a rival bidder for the team before joining the Calgary consortium. The group agreed to purchase the Flames for $16 million, at the time the highest price ever paid for an NHL franchise. The sale was announced on May 21, 1980, and the franchise relocated to Canada where it became the Calgary Flames. The Flames have since used the Atlanta logo for both its alternate captains, and the team&#x27;s former affiliate that played in the American Hockey League (AHL), the Adirondack Flames.

The last Atlanta Flames player on the Calgary roster was Paul Reinhart, upon being traded to Vancouver Canucks after the 1987–88 season. The last active Atlanta Flames player in the NHL was Kent Nilsson, who returned to the NHL for six games in 1995, after spending the prior seven seasons in European leagues. Before his return to the NHL, that distinction belonged to Brad Marsh, who retired at the end of the 1992–93 season.

Several former players of the team returned to Atlanta once their careers ended. Among them, Tom Lysiak operated a horse farm outside the city, Eric Vail returned to operate a nightclub and Willi Plett operated a sporting theme park and golf course. Fletcher would remain the team&#x27;s general manager until 1991, steering the team to two appearances in the Stanley Cup Finals and a Cup victory in 1989. The Flames would appear in the playoffs every year until 1991, a streak of 16 consecutive seasons dating to their fourth year in Atlanta.

==The NHL returns to Atlanta, then leaves again==
The NHL returned to Atlanta in 1999, when the Atlanta Thrashers joined the league as an expansion franchise. The Flames and Thrashers were however in opposing conferences; this meant that the Flames, who were in the Western Conference, would play one game in Atlanta annually until the 2010–11 season, when the Thrashers announced that they were sold and relocating to Winnipeg, Manitoba, becoming the second incarnation of the Winnipeg Jets. Atlanta is the only other city besides Quebec City to have lost two NHL teams, in both cases, relocating to Western Canada.

==Uniform==
In their eight-year history, the Atlanta Flames wore red and white uniforms with yellow accents. This set generally had contrasting color stripes with yellow borders along the sleeves, socks and tail. A red shoulder stripe adorned the white uniforms. They carried this set over to Calgary following the relocation, replacing the &quot;flaming A&quot; with the &quot;flaming C&quot; decal in front. The &quot;flaming A&quot; was later used by the Calgary Flames to denote alternate captains.

Coincidentally, their then-sister team Atlanta Hawks also changed their colors to red and yellow shortly after the Flames were established. They would keep this color scheme until 2007, only to be restored in 2020. The Hawks also added black as a tertiary color in 1992, with the now-Calgary Flames following suit in 1995; as of 2024, both teams currently wear black uniforms as third jerseys while their primary uniforms dropped black from the color scheme.

==Season-by-season record==

The Flames had a 268–260–108 regular season record, and a 2–15 playoff record.

===Award winners===
Three members of the Flames were named recipients of NHL awards during the team&#x27;s tenure in Atlanta. Eric Vail was the first, as he won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the top rookie in 1974–75 after scoring 39 goals and finishing with 60 points. Paraguayan-born Willi Plett won the award two years later after scoring 33 goals and 23 assists in his first full NHL season. Bob MacMillan was named the league&#x27;s most gentlemanly player in 1978–79, which earned him the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy. He finished fifth overall in league scoring with 104 points while accruing only 14 penalty minutes throughout the season.

Seven players represented the Flames at the NHL All-Star Game. Randy Manery became the team&#x27;s first all-star when he played in the 1973 contest. He was subsequently joined by Al McDonough (1974), Tom Lysiak (1975, 1976 and 1977), Curt Bennett (1975 and 1976), Eric Vail (1977), Bill Clement (1978) and Kent Nilsson (1980).

===Hockey Hall of Fame===
There are four members of the Atlanta Flames organization to be enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame:
* Bernie Geoffrion, was also inducted into the player category in 1972, the same year he joined the Flames organization at the Flames first head coach.
* Cliff Fletcher, a native of Montreal, began his career in hockey management as a scout for the Montreal Canadiens in 1956 and rose to the position of assistant general manager with the St. Louis Blues before being hired in 1972 as the inaugural and lone general manager of the Atlanta Flames. Fletcher remained with the organization for another 11 years following its transition to Calgary and was the architect of the franchise&#x27;s lone Stanley Cup championship, in 1989. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2004 as a builder.
* Pat Quinn played with the Atlanta Flames from 1972 to 1977 was inducted in 2016 as a builder for coaching various teams around the NHL.
* David Poile an executive with the Flames served in various roles from 1972 to 1982 before moving on to the Washington Capitals was inducted in 2024.

No Atlanta Flames player has been inducted into the players category.

===Broadcasters===
All of the Flames&#x27; radio and television broadcasts were simulcasts. The Flames&#x27; games were televised over-the-air on WTCG 17 and on the radio by WSB (AM). Jiggs McDonald was the main play-by-play announcer with Skip Caray substituting from 1976–80. Color commentators included Andy Still (1972–73), Bob Neal (1973–74), Ed Thilenius (1974–75; home and televised games only), Bernie Geoffrion (1975–79), and Bobby Harper (1979–80; home games only). Pete Van Wieren also did play-by-play for the Flames.

<text>The Winnipeg Jets were a professional ice hockey team based in Winnipeg. They began play in the World Hockey Association (WHA) in 1972. The club joined the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1979 after the NHL merged with the WHA. Due to mounting financial troubles, in 1996 the franchise moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and became the Phoenix Coyotes (the former name of the now inactive Arizona Coyotes). The team played their home games at Winnipeg Arena.

==History==

===The WHA years (1972–1979)===
On December 27, 1971, Winnipeg was granted one of the founding franchises in the World Hockey Association (WHA). The original owner was Ben Hatskin, a local figure who made his wealth in cardboard shipping containers. The team took their name from the Winnipeg Jets of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL).

The Jets&#x27; first signing was Norm Beaudin (earning the player the moniker of &quot;the Original Jet&quot;), while the first major signing was Bobby Hull. Hull&#x27;s acquisition, partially financed by the rest of the WHA&#x27;s teams, gave the league instant credibility and paved the way for other NHL stars to bolt to the upstart league.

The Jets were the first North American club to seriously explore Europe as a source of ice hockey talent. Winnipeg&#x27;s fortunes were bolstered by acquisitions such as Swedish forwards Anders Hedberg and Ulf Nilsson, who starred with Hull on the WHA&#x27;s most famous and successful forward line (nicknamed &quot;the Hot Line&quot;), and defenceman Lars-Erik Sjoberg, who would serve as the team&#x27;s captain and win accolades as the WHA&#x27;s best defenceman. Behind these players and other European stars such as Willy Lindstrom, Kent Nilsson, Veli-Pekka Ketola, leavened by players such as Peter Sullivan, Norm Beaudin and goaltender Joe Daley, the Jets were the most successful team in the short-lived WHA. The team made the finals in five of the WHA&#x27;s seven seasons, winning the Avco World Trophy three times, including in the league&#x27;s final season against Wayne Gretzky and the Edmonton Oilers.

Another notable accomplishment was the Jets&#x27; 5–3 victory over the Soviet Union national team on January 5, 1978.

In the WHA&#x27;s last season, Kent Nilsson scored 107 points, while Morris Lukowich had 65 goals, and Peter Sullivan had 46 goals and 86 points. During the 1979 Avco Cup Finals, Gary Smith gave up the last goal in WHA history to Dave Semenko in a 7–3 win against the Oilers.

The 1975–76, 1977–78 and 1978–79 Avco Cup-winning Winnipeg Jets teams were inducted into the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame in the team category.

===The NHL years (1979–1996)===
By 1978–79, the vast majority of the WHA&#x27;s teams had folded, but the Jets were still going strong. After the season, the Jets were absorbed into the NHL along with the Quebec Nordiques, Edmonton Oilers and Hartford Whalers. Pre-merger inter-league exhibitions had shown that the 1978–79 Jets were the competitive equal of most NHL teams, with the possible exceptions of the three-time defending Stanley Cup champion, the Montreal Canadiens, and the rising New York Islanders.

However, the Jets had to pay a very high price for a berth in the more established league. They had to give up three of their top six scorers – the core of the last WHA champion – in the 1979 NHL expansion draft, and were also forced to draft 18th out of 21 teams. In the expansion draft, they opted to protect defenceman Scott Campbell, who had shown a good deal of promise in the last WHA season. However, Campbell suffered from chronic asthma that was only exacerbated by Winnipeg&#x27;s frigid weather. The asthma drove him out of the league entirely by 1982.

Upon entering the NHL, the Jets were put in the Smythe Division of the Campbell Conference. However, with a decimated roster, the Jets finished at the bottom in overall league standings during their first two seasons in the NHL, including a horrendous nine-win season in 1980–81 that still ranks as the worst in the Jets/Coyotes history. This stands in marked contrast to the other 1979 Avco Cup finalist, the Oilers, who went on to dominate the league during the second half of the 1980s.

The Jets&#x27; first two wretched NHL seasons did net them high draft picks; in the 1980 draft they picked Dave Babych second overall and in 1981 they drafted future Hall of Fame member Dale Hawerchuk first overall. The team developed a solid core of players by the mid-1980s, with Hawerchuk, Thomas Steen, Paul MacLean, Randy Carlyle, Laurie Boschman, Doug Smail, and David Ellett providing a strong nucleus. Also in 1981, a league-wide realignment placed the Jets with the league&#x27;s other Central Time Zone teams in the Norris Division, which over the course of the decade would become the weakest division in the league.

Led by Hawerchuk, Steen, Babych and Carlyle, the Jets returned to respectability fairly quickly, and made the playoffs 11 times in the next 15 years. However, regular season success did not transfer over into the playoffs. This was because after just one season in the Norris Division, the relocation of the Colorado Rockies to New Jersey compelled Winnipeg to return to the more competitive Smythe Division along with the Oilers and Calgary Flames – by some accounts, the two best teams in the league during the second half of the 1980s. Due to the way the playoffs were structured at the time, whenever the Jets made the playoffs, they faced the near-certainty of having to beat either the Oilers or the Flames (or both) to get to the Campbell Conference finals. At the time, the top four teams in each division made the playoffs, with the regular season division winner playing against the fourth-placed team and the regular season runner-up playing the third-placed team in the division semifinals. The division semifinals winners advanced to the division finals, and the two division finals winners would meet in the conference finals.

For example, in 1984–85, they finished with the fourth-best record in the entire league (behind only Philadelphia, Edmonton and Washington). They also notched 96 points, which would remain the franchise&#x27;s best as an NHL team until the 2009–10 Coyotes racked up the franchise&#x27;s second 100-point season (and first as an NHL team). However, they finished second in the division behind the Oilers. While they managed to dispatch the Flames (with the league&#x27;s fifth-best record) in four games in the best-of-five division semifinals, they were swept by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Oilers in the division finals. In fact, Winnipeg and Edmonton played each other in the playoffs six times between 1983 and 1990. The Oilers not only won every series, but also held the Jets to only four total victories. Five times (1984, 1985, 1987, 1988, and 1990), the Oilers went on to win the Stanley Cup. The Jets won only one more playoff series in 1987 (defeating Calgary in the division semifinals before losing to Edmonton in the division finals). It was not until the 1993–94 season that further expansion and re-alignment placed the Jets in the Central Division of the Western Conference. By this time however, the Central was at least the competitive equal to the Pacific Division and the strict division-based playoff bracket had been abandoned.

====Demise and relocation====
As the NHL expanded in the United States and free agency rules were liberalized, operating costs and salaries grew rapidly; players had the leverage to demand being paid in U.S. dollars league-wide. Until about the early 1990s, Canadian teams were able to pay their players in Canadian dollars, with the exceptions being contracts acquired in trades from U.S. teams. However, since the Canadian teams still collected most of their revenue in Canadian dollars, having to pay players in U.S. dollars proved to be a serious drain on finances given the declining value of the Canadian dollar. For most of their NHL tenure, Winnipeg was the league&#x27;s second-smallest market, and was set to become the smallest market after the Quebec Nordiques moved to Denver as the Colorado Avalanche in 1995–96. Despite a loyal fan following, serious doubts were raised about whether Winnipeg could continue to support an NHL team. Additionally, their home arena, Winnipeg Arena, was over 40 years old, had no luxury suites, and numerous obstructed-view seats.

Faced with mounting losses, Jets owner Barry Shenkarow agreed to sell the team to American businessmen Steven Gluckstern and Richard Burke for $65 million. They planned to move the team to the Minneapolis–Saint Paul region, which had lost the Minnesota North Stars to Dallas before the 1993–94 season. In response, a local consortium called the Spirit of Manitoba was assembled. While they persuaded Shenkarow to delay the proposed sale to American interests long enough that the Jets ultimately remained in Winnipeg for the 1995–96 season, it eventually became apparent that the Spirit of Manitoba consortium was far too undercapitalized to purchase the franchise and underwrite expected losses while a proposed new arena was built.

Meanwhile, Gluckstern and Burke failed to reach an agreement with the Minneapolis to share the Target Center with the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Minnesota Timberwolves. They purchased the team nevertheless, but with no suitable alternate venues in the Twin Cities area, the Jets&#x27; new owners reached an agreement with Jerry Colangelo, owner of the NBA&#x27;s Phoenix Suns, to move the team to Phoenix and rename them to Phoenix Coyotes. The Jets managed to qualify for the 1996 Stanley Cup playoffs in their final season in Winnipeg, and played their last game on April 28, 1996, a home playoff loss to the Detroit Red Wings by a score of 4–1. Norm Maciver scored the last goal in Jets history.

===Aftermath===
Winnipeg was not left without a professional ice hockey team for the 1996–97 season as the International Hockey League&#x27;s Minnesota Moose moved to Winnipeg to become the Manitoba Moose a few months after the Jets left.

The NHL ultimately returned to Winnipeg 15 years later, with the Atlanta Thrashers relocating to become the second incarnation of the Jets franchise which is owned by True North Sports &amp; Entertainment. Prior to this, True North submitted a series of bids for the financially-troubled Coyotes in October 2009, which were taken seriously enough that the league drew up a tentative schedule with Winnipeg in place of Phoenix. The NHL shelved the bid after securing a large subsidy from the Coyotes&#x27; municipal government. As True North&#x27;s low-key approach was praised by NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, this placed True North in a favorable position once question of the Thrashers&#x27; relocation came up.

The new Jets, despite reclaiming the name and subsequently the original franchise&#x27;s logos, retained the Thrashers franchise records rather than the records of the original Jets.
During their history, the Jets retired two numbers: Bobby Hull&#x27;s no. 9 and Thomas Steen&#x27;s no. 25. The Coyotes have continued to honour those numbers, and hang their banners in the Jets&#x27; old blue-red-white colour scheme. Dale Hawerchuk&#x27;s no. 10 was added in 2006, in the Coyotes&#x27; sand-red-black scheme. Another tradition that was retained when the franchise moved to Phoenix was the &quot;whiteout&quot;, in which fans wore all white to home playoff games.

Shane Doan, drafted seventh overall by the Jets in the 1995 NHL entry draft prior to their last season in Winnipeg, and who played his rookie season in Winnipeg, was the last original Jets player to still be active in the NHL (and to still be with the franchise) upon his retirement in 2017. The only other former original Jets player playing professionally by that time was Deron Quint, who played in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL) in Germany until 2017.

The current Winnipeg Jets have acknowledged the original Jets&#x27; history on a number of occasions. The original franchise&#x27;s division and Avco Cup championships hang atop the rafters of Canada Life Centre, as are the honoured numbers of the original Jets who were inducted into the current Jets&#x27; Hall of Fame. They have also worn throwback uniforms of the original Jets on a few occasions, and brought back the whiteout tradition in the Stanley Cup playoffs. The new franchise acquired the trademarks to the name and logo of the original Jets from the NHL when it moved to Winnipeg – at the time, the league directly owned the Coyotes and thus controlled the Jets&#x27; trademarks. However, the franchise&#x27;s records still belong to the Coyotes.

In April 2024, after years of instability, the Coyotes suspended operations, with their assets (including players and hockey operations staff) being transferred to the new Utah Hockey Club. Unlike the Thrashers&#x27; relocation to Winnipeg (which saw all records transferred), the Coyotes entered inactivity, with their intellectual property remaining in Phoenix. Coyotes owner Alex Meruelo was granted a five-year window to construct a new arena in the Phoenix area, upon which automatic expansion would have been triggered to &quot;re-activate&quot; the Coyotes. However, in late June, Meruelo opted to discontinue his efforts to build an arena and re-activate the team, ceding the Coyotes intellectual property back to the NHL, and leaving the fate of the Jets/Coyotes records uncertain.

==Uniforms==
The Jets debuted in the WHA wearing blue and white uniforms with red trim. White uniforms featured a blue shoulder yoke, blue numbers and blue-white-red-white-blue waist, sock and sleeve stripes. The blue uniforms were the inverse of their white counterparts minus the contrasting yoke and used red numbers. In the franchise&#x27;s first season, the uniforms featured the futuristic &quot;Jets&quot; wordmark in front along with red or white player nameplates. Starting in 1974, the Jets donned their &quot;classic&quot; look, ditching the contrast-colour nameplates and unveiling their famous roundel logo. In 1977, the Jets added a white shoulder yoke on the blue uniform, and the following season, switched from red to blue pants.

Upon moving to the NHL in 1979, the Jets unveiled new uniforms. Then-general manager John Ferguson Sr. had been derided for changing the classic New York Rangers uniforms during the late 1970s, so he brought most elements of that design to the Jets. Both uniforms featured a thick shoulder stripe that extended through the sleeves, along with another thick stripe on the waist. In addition, the blue uniforms now featured white numbers with red trim and a white inverse of the team&#x27;s logo in front. In 1987, the Jets added a &quot;Goals for Kids&quot; patch which remained a prominent figure on the uniforms until the relocation.

In 1990, the Jets unveiled their final uniform design, featuring the updated crest in front and contrasting sleeve and waist stripes. They also switched back to red pants.

The current incarnation of the Winnipeg Jets employs a different uniform design and logo, although they occasionally use the &quot;old&quot; Jets uniform as an alternate jersey. For the 2020–21 season, a &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; jersey was introduced in collaboration with Adidas. The jersey was designed to emulate the original Jets&#x27; 1979–1990 look, but used colours of the current Jets. Before the 2021–22 season, the blue WHA-era uniform the modern-day Jets wore in the 2019 Heritage Classic became the team&#x27;s third jersey. A second &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; jersey, this time a recoloured version of the 1990–1996 Jets white uniform, was released in the 2022–23 season.

==Winnipeg whiteout==

The Winnipeg whiteout is a tradition that dates back to 1987 when fans were asked to wear white clothing to home playoff games, creating a very intimidating effect and atmosphere. It was created as a response to the &quot;C of Red&quot; created by fans of the Calgary Flames, whom the hometown Jets were facing in the first round of the 1987 Stanley Cup playoffs. The Jets eliminated the Flames in six games, and fans wore white for every home playoff game thereafter. Fans dubbed it the &quot;White Out&quot; which is a prairie term for a winter snow storm. Marketing for the team during the playoff referred to the &quot;charge of the white brigade.&quot; In later years, marketing referred to the whiteout as &quot;White Noise.&quot;

Fans of the American Hockey League&#x27;s Manitoba Moose also continued this tradition when the team briefly relocated to St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, as the St. John&#x27;s IceCaps, as did fans of the &quot;IceCap&#x27;s White Out&quot; respectively. and &quot;Coyotes White Out&quot;, When the Thrashers moved to Winnipeg as the second incarnation of the Jets, they brought back the whiteout tradition for all playoff appearances of the Jets.

===Retired numbers===
The original Winnipeg Jets retired two numbers in their history. When the Jets relocated to Arizona, the banners of these players also made the move, and these numbers originally remain retired with the Arizona Coyotes, in Jets&#x27; colors. Beginning with the 2014–15 season, those numbers were unretired and brought back to circulation; they were still inducted as part of the Arizona Coyotes Ring of Honor. After the move to Arizona, number 10 was inducted in honor of Dale Hawerchuk, number 7 was inducted for Keith Tkachuk, and number 27 was inducted for Teppo Numminen. Shane Doan&#x27;s number 19 was the only number officially retired by the Coyotes.

The current Winnipeg Jets (formerly Atlanta Thrashers) also honoured both numbers in the Winnipeg Jets Hall of Fame.

Notes:
* 1 Bobby Hull&#x27;s number was temporarily unretired by the successor Coyotes franchise for Bobby&#x27;s son Brett in the 2005–06 season before his son Brett retired five games into that season.

<text>The Hartford Whalers were a professional ice hockey team based for most of its 25-year existence in Hartford, Connecticut. The club played in the World Hockey Association (WHA) from 1972 until 1979, and in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1979 to 1997.

Originally based in Boston, they were charter members of the WHA, known as the New England Whalers for all seven seasons. After their second season, the team moved southwest to Hartford in April 1974; five years later, the Whalers joined the NHL in the 1979 NHL–WHA merger and were renamed the &quot;Hartford Whalers&quot; because the Boston Bruins did not want to share a geographical market with the team.

After 25 years in New England, the franchise relocated to North Carolina in 1997 and became the Carolina Hurricanes.

==WHA history==

===Early seasons in Boston (1971–1974)===
The Whalers franchise was created in November 1971 when the World Hockey Association (WHA) awarded a franchise to New England businessmen Howard Baldwin, W. Godfrey Wood, John Coburn and William Edward Barnes to begin play in Boston. The team began auspiciously, signing former Detroit Red Wings star Tom Webster, hard rock Boston Bruins&#x27; defenseman Ted Green (the team&#x27;s inaugural captain), Toronto Maple Leafs&#x27; defensemen Rick Ley, Jim Dorey and Brad Selwood, and former Pittsburgh Penguins&#x27; goaltender Al Smith.

New England signed an unusually large number of American players, including Massachusetts natives and former U.S. Olympic hockey team members Larry Pleau (who had been a regular with the Montreal Canadiens the previous season), Kevin Ahearn, John Cunniff and Paul Hurley. Two other ex-U.S. Olympians on the Whalers&#x27; roster (Timothy Sheehy and Tom Williams) had spent a significant part of their careers in Boston with Boston College and the Bruins, respectively.

The Whalers had the WHA&#x27;s best regular season record in the 1972–73 season. Webster led the team in scoring and through the playoffs. Behind legendary ex-Boston University head coach Jack Kelley, the team defeated the Winnipeg Jets to win the inaugural WHA championship.

The club played first season&#x27;s home games at Boston Garden and Boston Arena. However, the Arena was too small and antiquated to sustain a WHA team while the Garden was owned by the rival NHL Bruins in which the Whalers found themselves fourth in priority for dates behind the Bruins, Boston Celtics, and even the American Hockey League&#x27;s Boston Braves. Fed up with the situation, Baldwin decided to move elsewhere. In late February 1974, he announced the Whalers&#x27; upcoming relocation to Hartford, targeted for early April.

===Relocation to Hartford (1974)===
Hartford was about to open a new, modern downtown arena and convention center, the Hartford Civic Center. The city had hoped to get an American Basketball Association (ABA) team as the main tenant, but when that fell through, city leaders got in touch with the Whalers. Aside from various minor league teams in New Haven, the area had been largely bereft of professional hockey until the Whalers&#x27; arrival. The Civic Center was still being finished when the 1974–75 season began, so the Whalers played the first part of the season at The Big E Coliseum in West Springfield, Massachusetts, about north.

On January 11, 1975, the team played its first game at the Hartford Civic Center in front of a sellout crowd. The franchise remained in Hartford until it relocated to North Carolina for the 1997–98 season, albeit with an interruption for three years (January 1977-February 1980) where the team elected to play at the Springfield Civic Center when heavy snow and rain caused the roof of the Hartford arena to collapse.

Though they never again won the WHA championship, the New England Whalers were a successful team, never missing the playoffs in league history, and finishing first in their division three times. They had a more stable roster than most WHA teams: Ley, Webster, Selwood, Pleau, and Tommy Earl played over 350 games each with the club. The team scored a major coup when it signed legend Gordie Howe and his sons Mark and Marty from the Houston Aeros in 1977.

The Whalers recorded losing records in their first two full seasons in Hartford, their final two WHA seasons saw more success. They went to the finals again in 1978, with a veteran team spearheaded by the Howes—50-year-old Gordie led the team in scoring—future NHL stars Gordie Roberts and Mike Rogers, All-Star defenseman Ron Plumb, and forwards John McKenzie, Dave Keon and Mike Antonovich, and possessed the league&#x27;s best defense. The next season was not as great, however, but while age finally caught up with Gordie Howe, the slack was picked up by Andre Lacroix, the WHA&#x27;s all-time leading scorer, acquired from the Aeros.

==Admission to the NHL==

As the Whalers were one of the most stable WHA teams, the club was one of the four franchises admitted to the NHL when the rival leagues merged in 1979. Unlike the other former WHA teams, the Whalers were not stripped of most of their players. The Howes, Rogers, Ley, Keon, Smith, Roberts and Lacroix are the New England Whalers players who stayed on the team as it made the transition to the NHL and became the Hartford Whalers. (In the case of the Howes, Detroit intentionally turned down their option to re-sign longtime Red Wing Gordie, out of respect for his legacy already in place there.) Only Selwood, George Lyle and Warren Miller were reclaimed by their former NHL teams. The Whalers were the only American-based WHA team to join the NHL.

The New England Whalers renamed themselves the Hartford Whalers in May 1979, at the insistence of the Boston Bruins who objected to the team naming themselves for New England. Connecticut-based graphic designer Peter Good (1942–2023) was hired by the Jack Lardis Associates advertising agency to design a new logo for the team. Good put a whale&#x27;s tail over a &quot;W&quot;, allowing the negative space between the two shapes to create an &quot;H&quot;. Good also helped design the team&#x27;s new uniforms for the 1979–80 season in the team&#x27;s new colors of green and blue.

==NHL history==
The Whalers were never as successful in the NHL as they had been in the WHA. They recorded only three winning seasons in their 18 years in the NHL, made the Stanley Cup playoffs eight times and won only one playoff series, earning the nickname &quot;The Forever .500s&quot; in mocking jest of their winning percentage. Whenever they did make the playoffs, they faced the near-certainty of having to get past the Boston Bruins or Montreal Canadiens to make it to the conference finals. The team developed a heated rivalry with the Bruins because they were based only 100 miles northeast of Hartford and the fact they used to play in the same arena. Home games against the Bruins usually attracted the Whalers&#x27; largest crowds, as many Bruins fans followed their team to Hartford. The Whalers had an all-time head-to-head record of 37–69–12 against Boston.

The Whalers were hampered by numerous off-ice factors. Hartford was the smallest American market in the NHL and was located on the traditional dividing line between the home territories for Boston and New York area teams. This limited the team&#x27;s marketability. Additionally, for most of the Whalers&#x27; tenure as an NHL team, the Hartford Civic Center was one of the smallest arenas in the league. At its maximum, it seated just 15,635 for hockey. The team averaged over 14,000 fans only twice in its 15 years at the Civic Center. They averaged only 13,867 from 1980 to 1997. Most of their sellouts came when either the Bruins, the New York Islanders, or the New York Rangers played in Hartford, bringing thousands of their own fans with them.

===Inaugural NHL season===
Upon joining the NHL, the Whalers were placed in the Norris Division of the Wales Conference. Their first NHL season in 1979–80 looked somewhat promising. They were led by Mike Rogers, Blaine Stoughton, Dave Keon, Mark Howe, Rick Ley, NHL legend Gordie Howe and the all-time WHA leading scorer, Andre Lacroix, along with the franchise&#x27;s first starting goaltender, Al Smith. The Whalers also acquired another NHL legend, Bobby Hull, near the NHL trade deadline in 1980. They finished the season with 73 points and a playoff berth and had the best record of the four former WHA franchises that entered the NHL in 1979–80. The Whalers remained the most recent first-year expansion franchise to make the playoffs in their inaugural season, along with the 1979–80 Edmonton Oilers until the 2017–18 Vegas Golden Knights accomplished the feat. In the first round of the playoffs, the Whalers were swept by the Montreal Canadiens three games to none. Following this season, Gordie Howe, Bobby Hull and Andre Lacroix all announced their retirements from professional hockey.

===The early 1980s===
Following the 1979–80 season, the Whalers had many aging veterans left over from their WHA days. To make matters worse, the Whalers reputation of making disastrous trades began to unfold, as the team began to trade away stars for mediocre players in an attempt to gain depth. For instance, they traded star defenseman Mark Howe and their first NHL scoring leader, Mike Rogers, in separate deals for players and draft picks which never panned out, and also swapped defensive-defenseman Gordie Roberts, who would go on to play 15 remaining professional seasons, for the remaining half of the season of Mike Fidler&#x27;s NHL career. For the 1981–82 season, the NHL realigned its divisions and the Whalers were resituated in the Adams Division of the Wales Conference. The Whalers bottomed out in the 1982–83 season with a record of 19–54–7 (45 points), ranked 20th out of 21 teams in the NHL standings. On May 2, 1983, the Whalers hired Emile Francis as their new general manager to rebuild the team. About two months later, on July 7, Francis hired Jack Evans to be the Whalers&#x27; new head coach. By the end of the 1986–87 season, Francis had cut or traded away every player from the 1982–83 Whalers&#x27; roster save for Ron Francis, Paul MacDermid, and Paul Lawless.

===Success in the mid-1980s===
The team had a brief period of success in the 1985–86 and 1986–87 seasons. The Whalers began 1985–86 looking like a playoff contender. By the end of January, they had a record of 26–20–1 for 53 points after 47 games. At this time, however, the Whalers began to struggle when they lost their franchise player Ron Francis and star goal scorer Kevin Dineen to injuries. As a result, the Whalers struggled through February, winning just two games in the month and in danger of missing the playoffs for the sixth year in a row. In March, Francis and Dineen returned from their injuries and the Whalers put up a record of 12–4–2 in the months of March and April. The Whalers finished fourth in the Adams Division in the 1985–86 regular season, earning themselves a playoff berth for the first time since 1980. The Whalers went on to eliminate the first-place Quebec Nordiques in a three-game sweep in the first round, winning their first, and only, NHL playoff series in Hartford. The Whalers then pushed the division finals to seven games, losing the final game 2–1 in overtime to the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Montreal Canadiens.

The following season, 1986–87, the Whalers won their lone division championship, led by centers Ron Francis and Ray Ferraro, emerging winger Kevin Dineen, defenseman Ulf Samuelsson, superstar goaltender Mike Liut and scorer Sylvain Turgeon. The 93 points earned that season were the most they would earn as an NHL team in Hartford; however, they were quickly eliminated in the first round by the Nordiques. The Whalers started the series strongly, winning the first two games at home, but, beginning in Game 3, the Nordiques were able to successfully take the Whalers off their game by playing a tough, chippy style of hockey. As a result, both teams broke NHL records in penalty minutes for an individual playoff game and a whole playoff series. The Nordiques won the next four games and thus the series, four games to two. While Hartford would make the playoffs for the next five seasons in a row, they never came close to duplicating their previous success, with one exception in the 1989–90 season.

===The 1989–90 season===
In 1989–90, the Whalers finished seventh overall in the NHL standings and fourth overall in the Wales Conference, with 85 points. This was the franchise&#x27;s second-highest point total in the NHL while located in Hartford. The regular season was highlighted by captain Ron Francis putting up career highs in goals (32), assists (69) and points (101). Later in his career, Francis was only able to exceed 101 points once (in 1995–96) and never again exceeded 32 goals in a single season. At the trade deadline, the Whalers first year general manager Eddie Johnston made the first in a series of destructive trades by sending franchise goaltender Mike Liut to the Washington Capitals in exchange for center Yvon Corriveau. Liut was having a career year during the 1989–90 season and this trade left the Whalers with sophomore goaltender Peter Sidorkiewicz as their starter, with rookie Kay Whitmore as the backup.

The Whalers went on to face the Boston Bruins in the first round of the playoffs. In Game 4, the Whalers were in front of their home crowd with a two games to one series lead and a 5–2 lead in the game entering the third period. Bruins starting goaltender Reggie Lemelin was struggling throughout the series and was replaced by backup Andy Moog in the third period. At the same time, Peter Sidorkiewicz began struggling in goal for the Whalers, and the Bruins scored four unanswered goals in the third period, winning the game 6–5. Sidorkiewicz struggled for the rest of the series and Moog was spectacular for the Bruins. Without Liut, the Whalers had to either stick with Sidorkiewicz, which they did, or use the unproven rookie, Kay Whitmore, in goal. Goaltending turned out to be one of the big differences in this series and the Bruins won it in seven games.

===The Ron Francis trade===
On March 4, 1991, Francis was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins, along with Ulf Samuelsson and Grant Jennings, in exchange for John Cullen, Zarley Zalapski and Jeff Parker. Francis was one of the most popular players on the team, and held nearly every significant offensive record in the franchise&#x27;s history, both in the WHA and NHL. The trade was savagely condemned by Whalers fans, few of whom believed &quot;The Hockey News&quot; assessment that the Whalers had actually come out on the better end of the trade. Parker would only play four games in Hartford before suffering a concussion and a knee injury within two weeks of each other, effectively ending his NHL career. The Francis trade was made all the more painful when Francis and Samuelsson promptly helped lead the Penguins to two consecutive Stanley Cup titles. Coincidentally, Eddie Johnston, the Hartford general manager who had orchestrated the Francis trade, would follow him to Pittsburgh as the Penguins&#x27; head coach two years later.

The trades that Johnston made, particularly the Ron Francis trade, proved to be disastrous for the Whalers, since the players acquired did not meet the team&#x27;s expectations, leaving the Whalers depleted of talent and costing them substantial goodwill in Hartford. The links below show all of the trades and transactions Ed Johnston made as the general manager of the Whalers.

===The 1992 playoffs===
The Whalers went to the playoffs for the final time in 1991–92 behind Jimmy Roberts&#x27; coaching, despite winning only 26 games. In those days, however, the top four teams in each division made the playoffs, regardless of record. They faced the heavily-favored Montreal Canadiens in the division semifinals. The Whalers lost Game 1 by a score of 2–0 and Game 2 by a score of 5–2, creating the expectation that the Canadiens would sweep the Whalers out of the first round, as they did in the 1989 playoffs. However, the Whalers came back home to win Games 3 and 4 by scores of 5–2 and 3–1, respectively. The main turning point in the series came in the second period of Game 5 — the Whalers had a 3–1 lead midway through the second period, where the Canadiens began rushing the crease and getting in the face of Whalers goaltender Frank Pietrangelo to distract him. The strategy worked, as the Canadiens scored four unanswered goals in the final five minutes of the second period. These goals were not called back, since this was before the time when the NHL began strictly enforcing crease infractions on goals. The Whalers lost Game 5 by a score of 7–4. The Whalers came back to win Game 6 by a score of 2–1 just 24 seconds into overtime on a goal by Yvon Corriveau. The series went back to Montreal for game 7 and the Whalers lost a dramatic double overtime game by a score of 3–2, as Russ Courtnall scored on a turnaround shot against Pietrangelo. Corriveau had an excellent chance for a second consecutive overtime winner in the first overtime period on a breakaway, but his shot missed the net. It was the last time the Whalers would qualify for the playoffs for the rest of their time in Hartford.

Roberts was fired thereafter, along with general manager Eddie Johnston. At the end of the three-year Johnston era, only seven players remained from the Whalers&#x27; active roster prior to Johnston taking over as general manager. Those players were forwards Ed Kastelic and Terry Yake; defensemen Randy Ladouceur, Brad Shaw and Adam Burt; and goaltenders Peter Sidorkiewicz and Kay Whitmore. During the summer of 1992, following Johnston&#x27;s departure, Shaw and Whitmore were traded away, Kastelic left via free agency and Sidorkiewicz was lost to the Ottawa Senators in the 1992 NHL expansion draft.

===The Brian Burke and Paul Holmgren years===
In the summer of 1992, the Whalers hired Brian Burke to replace Eddie Johnston as general manager to rebuild the Whalers. Burke had worked for the Vancouver Canucks, helping them build the team that eventually went to the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals. Burke hired Paul Holmgren to be the Whalers&#x27; new head coach. Holmgren had been the head coach of the Philadelphia Flyers. Holmgren immediately named Pat Verbeek the new captain and he ended up playing on a line with young stars Andrew Cassels and Geoff Sanderson. The Whalers also acquired goaltender Sean Burke in exchange for former first-round draft pick Bobby Holik. Cassels, Sanderson and Sean Burke remained star players for the Whalers through their final season in Hartford. In addition, future NHL star Michael Nylander began his NHL career with the Whalers during the 1992–93 season. Since the 1992–93 season was a rebuilding year for the Whalers, they finished the season with only 58 points, the second-worst point total in franchise history, and missed the playoffs for the first time since 1985.

The Whalers entered the 1993–94 season as members of the Northeast Division of the Eastern Conference, and with high hopes from a core of young talented players. The Whalers were also able to draft defenseman Chris Pronger, who began his career with the Whalers, playing alongside veteran defenseman Brad McCrimmon, and later became an NHL star. However, problems began at the management level when general manager Brian Burke announced he would resign when the season began to take an executive position with the NHL. In addition, Burke had some disagreements with Whalers owner Richard Gordon. After Burke left, Holmgren took over as both the head coach and general manager. The Whalers started off the season poorly. Holmgren felt he was unable to handle the job of general manager and head coach, so he made Pierre McGuire the new head coach. The coaching change did not help the Whalers, however, since McGuire was not popular with the players; the Whalers continued to struggle. The Whalers reached a low point in the season when six players and two assistant coaches were arrested in Buffalo, New York, after being involved in a bar room brawl. Pronger was one of the players arrested; he was 19 years of age at the time, two years below than the legal drinking age in the State of New York. Around this same time, Paul Holmgren checked himself into rehab for alcohol addiction after being arrested with a DUI in Simsbury. The Whalers finished the season with 63 points, only a five-point improvement from the previous season. One bright spot for the Whalers was the emergence of Sean Burke as their franchise and star goaltender. Another highlight of the 1993–94 season was when Brian Propp scored his 1,000th career NHL point with the Whalers. Propp announced his retirement after the season.

===New ownership===
In the summer of 1994, the Whalers were purchased, in a deal brokered by the Connecticut Development Authority, by Compuware CEO Peter Karmanos, along with partners Thomas Thewes and Jim Rutherford. Rutherford became the team&#x27;s new general manager and Holmgren returned as the head coach. The new ownership wanted to turn the team into a winner for the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season, so Rutherford went out to the free agent market and signed Jimmy Carson and Steven Rice. On draft day, the Whalers selected the highly rated Jeff O&#x27;Neill in the first round. Rutherford also acquired defenseman Glen Wesley from the Boston Bruins in exchange for three first-round draft picks (Kyle McLaren, Johnathan Aitken and Sergei Samsonov). Despite these acquisitions, the Whalers struggled at the beginning of the season, starting off with a record of 2–7–2. In mid-February, the Whalers began improving, led by their top line of Sanderson, Cassels and Verbeek, along with franchise goaltender Sean Burke. For the next 30 games, the Whalers put up a record of 16–11–3 and it appeared as if the Whalers were on their way to their first playoff berth since 1992. Unfortunately, the Whalers played poorly down the stretch, winning only one game in the last seven and missed the playoffs by four points.

Before the beginning of the 1995–96 season, the Whalers management became frustrated with the slow development of highly rated prospect Chris Pronger. As a result, Pronger was sent to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for Brendan Shanahan. Shanahan was not happy with the trade even before playing a single game in Hartford. However, he was immediately made the team&#x27;s new captain. The Whalers won their first four games of the season, but then struggled for the rest of the calendar year of 1995. As a result, Paul Maurice replaced Holmgren as head coach in November. On December 28, 1995, the Whalers received a morale boost when they reacquired one of their most popular players from the 1980s, Kevin Dineen. His skills and leadership had an immediate impact on the team, as the Whalers began playing significantly better in January. Despite the strong finish in the second half of the season, the Whalers were unable to recover from their poor start and they missed the playoffs for the fourth year in a row.

Before the beginning of the 1996–97 season, Brendan Shanahan ended his silence about his displeasure about playing in Hartford. He demanded a trade out of Hartford because he claimed he did not want to play in a small market for a team with an uncertain future about its location. Whalers fans and local media condemned Shanahan for his comments and he was immediately stripped of his captaincy; Kevin Dineen took over the role. After the second game of the season, Shanahan was traded (along with Brian Glynn) to the Detroit Red Wings for Keith Primeau, Paul Coffey and a first-round draft pick. Despite these problems, the Whalers got off to a very good start, with a 14–7–6 record after the first 27 games, sitting in first in their division. They were led by a strong first line of Sanderson, Cassels and Dineen along with a solid second line of Primeau, O&#x27;Neill and Sami Kapanen. During the calendar year of 1996, the Whalers achieved a record of 41–30–10 in 81 games. In 1997, following the good start, the Whalers&#x27; season began to slip away. This included a nine-game losing streak in January and a six-game losing streak in March. Despite the poor performance down the stretch, the Whalers still had an opportunity to make the playoffs in the final week of the season. However, the Whalers lost two games on the road to Ottawa and the New York Islanders, which eliminated them from the playoffs before their final regular season game against the Tampa Bay Lightning.

===Departure from Hartford===
Owner Peter Karmanos pledged to keep the Whalers in the city of Hartford for four years when he purchased the team in 1994. However, two years later, frustrated with lackluster attendance and little corporate support, he announced that if the Whalers were unable to sell at least 11,000 season tickets for the 1996–97 season, he would likely move the team. Furthermore, ownership only made season tickets available in full-season (41 games) packages, eliminating the popular six-, 9-, 10- and 20-game mini-plans in a strategy largely designed to spur purchases from corporations and wealthier individuals. Sales were underwhelming at the beginning of the campaign, and at the end of the 1995–96 season, it was still unknown whether the Whalers would stay in Connecticut past 1998 or move elsewhere. However, thanks to an aggressive civic campaign and the efforts of many fans, the Whalers announced that they would stay in Connecticut through at least 1997, one year shy of his original promise. The &quot;Save the Whale&quot; campaign netted season ticket sales totaling 8,563 in less than a 45-day span, despite the Whalers raising ticket prices by an average of 20 percent, eliminating partial ticket plans and increasing the deposit amount for season tickets by 750 percent. This represented an expansion of over 3,500 tickets from the existing base.

In early 1997, Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland stated that he did not want to spend Connecticut taxpayer dollars to fund a new arena in Hartford. Despite this, negotiations between the Whalers and Rowland to build a new $147.5 million arena seemed to be going well. Talks fell apart when Karmanos wanted an additional $45 million to cover losses during the three years the new arena was to be built. The Whalers ultimately announced that they would be leaving Hartford after the 1996–97 season. This marks one of the few times that a team announced it would leave its current city without having already announced an agreement with a new one. Karmanos had discussed relocating the Whalers to Norfolk, Virginia (which would have been the first major sports team for that market) as the Hampton Roads Rhinos, but the failure of a season-ticket drive in Norfolk, coupled with a lack of an adequate arena, led to those plans being canceled. Karmanos stated that Rowland had no intention of making a serious offer to keep the Whalers in Connecticut since Rowland harbored hopes to bring a National Football League (NFL) franchise to the State. Rowland went on to negotiate a tentative deal that would bring the New England Patriots to Connecticut, but those talks also fell apart after the state and Patriots ownership failed to reach an agreement on a new stadium, instead choosing to stay in Foxborough to build what would become Gillette Stadium.

On April 13, 1997, the Whalers played their last game in Hartford, defeating the Tampa Bay Lightning 2–1. Team captain Kevin Dineen, who had returned to Hartford midway through the 1995–96 season after being acquired in a trade with the Philadelphia Flyers, scored the final goal in Whalers history. On May 6, 1997, Karmanos announced the team would move to Raleigh, North Carolina, to become the Carolina Hurricanes, playing its first two seasons in North Carolina at the Greensboro Coliseum while awaiting arena construction in Raleigh, a year earlier than planned. Talks with Nashville, Columbus, and even Suburban Detroit were discussed before bringing the Whalers to North Carolina.

===Post-departure===
The following summer in 1997, the Binghamton Rangers, the American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate of the New York Rangers, relocated to the Hartford market to take the place of the Whalers, renaming themselves the Hartford Wolf Pack. Former Whalers owner Howard Baldwin acquired the right to manage the team in 2010 and announced that the Wolf Pack were changing their name to the Connecticut Whale in the middle of the 2010–11 season, adopting the Whalers&#x27; old green-blue-white palette. The team changed back to the Hartford Wolf Pack after the Rangers terminated the relationship following the 2012–13 season.

Glen Wesley was the last Whaler still active with the Hartford/Carolina franchise, upon his retirement on June 5, 2008, though his stint was not continuous, playing seven games for the Toronto Maple Leafs at the end of the 2002–03 season after a deadline deal before re-signing with Carolina in the 2003 off-season. Craig Adams was the last player drafted in Whalers&#x27; history. However, Adams did not become a member of the team until 2000, after the team had already moved to North Carolina, and he retired in 2015.

Goaltender Jean-Sebastien Giguere was the final former Hartford Whalers player still playing in the NHL; he retired after the end of the 2013–14 season. Robert Petrovicky was the last former Whaler active in professional hockey, playing in European leagues through the end of the 2015–16 season.

==Uniforms==
===New England: 1972–1979===
As the New England Whalers, the team generally wore dark green and white uniforms with a similar style to the iconic Detroit Red Wings uniforms. The uniforms feature the team roundel in front and the Pucky logo on either shoulder. In 1974, the white uniform added yellow trim and replaced the roundel logo with the &quot;harpoon W&quot; logo, and the following year, the green uniform adopted the same elements. In 1977, the striping on the waist and socks was modified.

===Green uniform era: 1979–1992===
After becoming the Hartford Whalers, the team adopted its most iconic uniform design: green and white uniforms with blue, white and green stripes and the new Peter Good-designed logo in front. The design underwent a few cosmetic changes, such as wearing Cooperalls in the 1982–83 season, switching from angular to straight sleeve stripes and back during the early 1990s, and removing the Pucky logo in 1985.

===Blue and silver uniform era: 1992–1997===
For the Whalers&#x27; final years in Hartford, the team switched their primary colors to dark blue and added silver accents to the logo and striping. The numbers received extra contrasting trim.

===Hurricanes&#x27; Whalers tribute===
In 2018, the Hurricanes announced they would wear green Hartford Whalers throwback uniforms during two games against the Boston Bruins, first on December 23, 2018, at home and again on March 5, 2019, in Boston. The announcement was generally viewed as positive recognition of the roots of the Hurricane franchise, although not all former Whalers&#x27; fans approved of the use. The Hurricanes again wore the Whalers uniforms for a home game against the Los Angeles Kings, on January 11, 2020. Its fourth appearance came on January 29, 2022, against the New Jersey Devils. The most recent appearance came on March 26, 2023, in a 4–3 shootout loss to the Bruins.

Adidas&#x27; &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; program in 2021 saw the Hurricanes wear silver versions of the classic Whalers uniform, bridging both Whalers eras in the design.

In the 2023–24 season, the Hurricanes wore a white version of the Whalers uniform against the Devils, and donned Cooperalls in pregame warmups.

==&quot;Brass Bonanza&quot; theme song==
Unlike most sports teams at any level the Whalers&#x27; had an official theme song. The song was entitled &quot;Brass Bonanza&quot;, and was a tune composed and arranged by Jacques Ysaye (under the pseudonym of Jack Say), originally called &quot;Evening Beat&quot;. The song was a big hit with the team, Whalers fans, and even fans of other NHL teams and was played at home games when the Whalers entered the rink for warmups and also after they scored a goal. It was introduced in the mid-1970s on the B side of a souvenir record of team radio-broadcast highlights while they were still named the New England Whalers and playing in the WHA. However, in 1992, then-general manager Brian Burke cancelled the use of the song because he said &quot;there were players who were embarrassed by it&quot;, and replaced it with a goal horn and the song &quot;Hot, Hot, Hot&quot; by Buster Poindexter, then a year later, &quot;Rock and Roll Part 2&quot; by Gary Glitter. While the goal horn is still used by the Hurricanes today, &quot;Brass Bonanza&quot; was quickly reintroduced after Burke left the team the following year.

The song is still very popular with Hartford crowds and continues to occasionally be played at XL Center events, including at Hartford Wolf Pack/Connecticut Whale games from 2011 to 2013 and at the University of Connecticut&#x27;s basketball and men&#x27;s ice hockey games. The song plays whenever a player on the city&#x27;s minor-league baseball team, the Hartford Yard Goats, hits a home run. It was also previously used by the Whalers&#x27; AHL affiliate, the Binghamton Whalers, the Danbury Whalers of the Federal Hockey League (FHL), and Quinnipiac University&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey teams. It has also been played at Fenway Park in Boston during Boston Red Sox games in between innings for several years. Rock bands have been known to play the song during shows in Connecticut, most notably The Zambonis. The song was played when the Carolina Hurricanes scored a goal on an event called heritage night where the Hurricanes dressed in Whalers attire. The Florida Everblades, a former affiliate of the Hurricanes in the ECHL, play the song after every home game at Hertz Arena. The song has now been adopted by the city&#x27;s soccer team, Hartford Athletic, and by the Premier Hockey Federation&#x27;s Connecticut Whale, being played after goals scored by the teams. The Victoria Royals of the WHL - Western Hockey League - have used the theme for goals since 2017.

==&quot;Pucky The Whale&quot; mascot==
The official mascot of the Whalers was named &quot;Pucky The Whale&quot; and most commonly referred to as &quot;Pucky&quot;. Depicted as a green whale, it was the team&#x27;s secondary logo appearing on the shoulders of their jerseys from the 1970s WHA days until the mid 1980s. In the 2010s a new mascot costume version of Pucky was making appearances around Connecticut.

==Season-by-season record==
The Whalers had a 281–236–38 regular season record, and a 41–33 playoff record in the WHA, along with three division titles and one Avco World Trophy. In the NHL, the team had a 534–709–177 regular season record, and a 18–31 playoff record, along with one division title.

===Retired numbers===

The retirement of McKenzie&#x27;s number was notable, in so far as it was one of the only three instances in NHL history (the others being the NHL Quebec Nordiques retiring J. C. Tremblay&#x27;s number and the Ottawa Senators retiring Frank Finnigan&#x27;s number) that an NHL franchise retired the number of a player who had never played for it while the franchise was in the NHL.

After the move to North Carolina, the Hurricanes returned number 2 and 19 to circulation; Glen Wesley was the only player to wear number 2 in Carolina before that number was re-retired in 2009 in his honor. Howe&#x27;s number 9 remained officially retired by Carolina, and has never been issued since the relocation to North Carolina, but there is no banner to acknowledge it.

<text>&quot;Washington Bullets&quot; is a song from The Clash&#x27;s 1980 album &quot;Sandinista!&quot;. A politically charged song, it is a simplified version of imperialist history from the 1959 Cuban Revolution to the Nicaraguan Sandinistas of the 1980s, with mention of the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Dalai Lama, Salvador Allende and Víctor Jara, referencing his death at the hands of the Chilean military dictatorship in the stadium that now bears his name. Although mainly a criticism of the foreign policy of the United States, the song&#x27;s final stanza also delivers a criticism of Communist states by making reference to the treatment of pacifist Buddhist monks in the People&#x27;s Republic of China during the Cultural Revolution and the Soviet Union&#x27;s Invasion of Afghanistan.

The song&#x27;s title is often thought to have been a pun on the name of Washington DC&#x27;s basketball team, the Washington Bullets (now called the Washington Wizards), but frontman Joe Strummer denied any knowledge of the basketball team prior to the song&#x27;s release.

The song is one of The Clash&#x27;s more experimental, in the reggae style, with a marimba and lyrics that are almost spoken rather than sung.

On the tribute album &quot;The Clash Tribute: The Never Ending Story&quot;, the song was covered by Attila the Stockbroker, with new lyrics to the later verses, omitting the reference to Afghanistan and The Clash&#x27;s subtle attack on communism. The new verses are critical of U.S. involvement in the end of the Soviet Union, and Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s embrace of western-style capitalism, making particular disparaging references to the new world order following the end of the Cold War.

<text>The Minister of Foreign Affairs () is the minister of the Crown in the Canadian Cabinet who is responsible for overseeing the Government of Canada&#x27;s international relations and is the lead minister responsible for Global Affairs Canada, though the minister of international trade leads on trade issues. In addition to Global Affairs Canada, the minister is also the lead in overseeing the International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development and the International Development Research Centre.

From 1909 to 1993, the office was called the Secretary of State for External Affairs. The first two secretaries of state for external affairs, from 1909 until 1912, (Charles Murphy under Sir Wilfrid Laurier and William James Roche under Sir Robert Borden) concurrently served as the Secretary of State for Canada. The two portfolios were permanently separated in 1912, and the external affairs portfolio was then held by the prime minister of Canada until 1946.

==History==
Ministers holding the external affairs and foreign affairs portfolios have sometimes played prominent international roles:

* Lester B. Pearson (a future prime minister) defused the Suez Crisis and established the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces and as a result received the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize.
* Joe Clark (a former prime minister) led opposition to South Africa&#x27;s Apartheid system within the Commonwealth of Nations, against initial resistance from the British government of Margaret Thatcher.
* Lloyd Axworthy brought about the Ottawa Treaty, banning anti-personnel landmines in most countries of the world.

As in Pearson&#x27;s case (and that of Louis St. Laurent, his predecessor), the portfolio can be a final stepping stone to the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office. Until 1946, it was customary for the office to be held by the sitting prime minister. John Diefenbaker would hold the portfolio on two subsequent occasions.

==Prior and subsequent diplomatic services==

Lester Pearson is the only minister to have been a diplomat prior to their appointment. Pearson entered the Canadian foreign service in 1927 and rose to become Canadian ambassador to the United States from 1944 to 1946.

Paul Martin, Sr. served as Canadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom after his retirement from active politics. Following his defeat in the 2011 election, Lawrence Cannon has served as Canadian ambassador to France since 2012, while Stéphane Dion was named Canadian ambassador to the European Union and Germany immediately after leaving cabinet in 2017. Unlike Pearson, none were career diplomats.

<text>The Utah Starzz were a Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) team based in Salt Lake City. They began play in the 1997 WNBA season as one of the league&#x27;s eight original teams.

==History==
One of the eight original WNBA teams, the Starzz, which was partially named after the old ABA team. Utah Jazz ownership was not interested in keeping the Starzz, and without new owners the team would have folded. No local ownership was found, so in 2002, the Starzz announced their intentions to move out of Salt Lake City. On December 5, 2002, the Utah Starzz was bought by Spurs Sports &amp; Entertainment, and it was announced that the Starzz would move immediately to San Antonio and change their nickname to the Silver Stars.

The Starzz were the sister team to the NBA&#x27;s Utah Jazz.

The Starzz relocated, in 2003, to San Antonio where the team became the San Antonio Silver Stars.

===Uniforms===
*1997–2002: For home games, white with blue on the sides and shoulders and white Starzz logo text on the chest. For away games, blue with purple on the sides and white Starzz logo text on the chest. The Starzz logo is on the shorts.

<doc id="270899" wikidata="Q498274" url="?curid=270899" title="Tombolo">
<text>A tombolo is a sandy or shingle isthmus. A tombolo, from the Italian &quot;&quot;, meaning &#x27;pillow&#x27; or &#x27;cushion&#x27;, and sometimes translated incorrectly as &quot;ayre&quot; (an ayre is a shingle beach of any kind), is a deposition landform by which an island becomes attached to the mainland by a narrow piece of land such as a spit or bar. Once attached, the island is then known as a tied island.

Several islands tied together by bars which rise above the water level are called a tombolo cluster. Two or more tombolos may form an enclosure (called a lagoon) that can eventually fill with sediment.

==Formation==
The shoreline moves toward the island (or detached breakwater) owing to the accretion of sand in the lee of the island, where wave energy and longshore drift are reduced and therefore deposition of sand occurs.

===Wave diffraction and refraction===
True tombolos are formed by wave refraction and diffraction. As waves near an island, they are slowed by the shallow water surrounding it. These waves then bend around the island to the opposite side as they approach. The wave pattern created by this water movement causes a convergence of longshore drift on the opposite side of the island. The beach sediments that are moving by lateral transport on the lee side of the island will accumulate there, conforming to the shape of the wave pattern. In other words, the waves sweep sediment together from both sides. Eventually, when enough sediment has built up, the beach shoreline, known as a spit, will connect with an island and form a tombolo.

=== Unidirectional longshore drift ===
In the case of longshore drift due to an oblique wave direction, like at Chesil Beach or Spurn Head, the flow of material is along the coast in a movement which is not determined by wave diffraction around the now tied island, such as the Isle of Portland, which it has reached. In this and similar cases like Cádiz, while the strip of beach material connected to the island may be technically called a tombolo because it links the island to the land, it is better thought of in terms of its formation as a spit, because the sand or shingle ridge is parallel rather than at right angles to the coast.

==Morphology and sediment distribution==
Tombolos demonstrate the sensitivity of shorelines. A small piece of land, such as an island, or a beached shipwreck can change the way that waves move, leading to different deposition of sediments. Sea level rise may also contribute to accretion, as material is pushed up with rising sea levels. Tombolos are more prone to natural fluctuations of profile and area as a result of tidal and weather events than a normal beach is.

Because of this susceptibility to weathering, tombolos are sometimes made more sturdy through the construction of roads or parking lots. The sediments that make up a tombolo are coarser towards the bottom and finer towards the surface. It is easy to see this pattern when the waves are destructive and wash away finer grained material at the top, revealing coarser sands and cobbles as the base.

<text>The Orlando Miracle were a Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) team based in Orlando, Florida. It began play in the 1999 WNBA season. The Miracle relocated, in 2003, to Uncasville, Connecticut, where the team became the Connecticut Sun. The Miracle was a sister team to the NBA&#x27;s Orlando Magic.

==History==
The city of Orlando was granted an expansion franchise in 1998, and the &quot;Orlando Miracle&quot; took the floor for the 1999 WNBA season.

The Miracle posted respectable records in their four years of existence (1999–2002). The Miracle made the playoffs once, in 2000, and lost in the first round against the Cleveland Rockers. In 2001, the Miracle took a step backwards, but they hosted the 2001 WNBA All-Star Game. In 2002, the Miracle posted a 16-16 record, but missed the playoffs after losing the tiebreaker for the final playoff spot to the Indiana Fever. 

The 2002 season would also prove to be the Miracle&#x27;s last in Orlando.

===Relocation to Connecticut===
After the 2002 WNBA season, the NBA sold off all of the WNBA franchises to the operators of the teams. Magic owner Rich DeVos was not interested in keeping the Miracle, and no local ownership group emerged. In January 2003, the Connecticut-based Mohegan Native American Tribe bought the team.

The new owners moved the team to Uncasville, Connecticut and changed the nickname to the Sun (in reference to the tribe&#x27;s Mohegan Sun casino.) The Connecticut Sun&#x27;s new nickname and logo were reminiscent of another Florida-based WNBA franchise, the Miami Sol, which folded at the same time as the Miracle.

===Uniforms===
*1999–2002: For home games, white with blue on the sides and shoulders and white Miracle logo text on the chest. For away games, blue with white on the sides and white Miracle logo text on the chest. The Miracle logo is on the shorts.

<text>The Portsmouth Spartans were a professional American football team that played in Portsmouth, Ohio, from their founding in 1928 to their relocation to Detroit in 1934. Originally drawing players from defunct independent professional and semi-professional teams, they joined the fledgling National Football League (NFL) in 1930. Their home stadium was Universal Stadium, known today as Spartan Municipal Stadium.

The team was sold to a new ownership group in 1934 and relocated to Detroit, where they became the Detroit Lions — a team which remains part of the NFL today.

==History==
The Spartans formed in 1928 when the team began importing players from defunct independent professional and semi-professional teams. The following year, Portsmouth residents agreed to fund the construction of a football stadium that was comparable to those in neighboring communities along the Ohio River. That approval prompted the National Football League to grant the city a franchise on July 12, 1930. 

The Spartans played their first NFL game at Universal Stadium on September 14. With fewer than 43,000 residents in 1930, Portsmouth became the NFL&#x27;s second smallest city, ahead of only Green Bay, which had a population of under 38,000. During the team&#x27;s first year in the league, the Spartans compiled a record of 5–6–3, tying for seventh place in the eleven-team league in 1930.

At the end of the 1931 season, the Green Bay Packers refused to play the Spartans in a game that had been tentatively scheduled since before the season had started. The Packers had the best record in the league at 12–2, but had not played the Spartans, who had the second-best record at 11–3. The president of the Packers at the time, Lee Joannes, said there was &quot;no logical reason&quot; to play the Spartans. This led to a new regime for scheduling the entire NFL season of games in advance, by a three-person committee designated by the NFL itself. Ratification by three-fourths of all NFL teams was required before a season would be played. It was the end of ad hoc scheduling by teams and eventually led to NFL teams only playing other NFL teams.

An early highlight of the 1932 season was the &quot;iron man&quot; game against the Green Bay Packers. In that game, Spartans coach Potsy Clark refused to make even a single substitution against the defending NFL champion Packers. Portsmouth won 19–0 and used only 11 players all game. At the end of the season, the Spartans were tied for first place in the league with the Chicago Bears. That prompted what in retrospect became known as the first NFL playoff game. Blizzard conditions in Chicago meant the game was moved from Wrigley Field&#x27;s outdoor field to the indoor field at Chicago Stadium, which allowed for only an 80-yard field. The Bears won the game 9–0, with a touchdown pass from Bronko Nagurski to Red Grange being the key play. The resulting interest led to the establishment of the Eastern and Western Divisions and a regular championship game beginning in 1933.

During their final three years in Portsmouth, the Spartans posted a record of 23–9–4, a .718 winning percentage that was surpassed only by the Bears. Despite their success on the gridiron, the Spartans were fighting to survive off the field. The team was in so much debt that the players received shares in the team in lieu of their salaries.

In 1934, a group led by George A. Richards, the owner of Detroit radio station WJR, was announced as having bought the Spartans and moved them to Detroit for the 1934 season. Richards renamed the team the Detroit Lions. He not only wanted to offer a nod to the Detroit Tigers, but also wanted to signal his goal of building a team that would be the &quot;king of the NFL.&quot;

<text>SS &quot;Saros&quot; was a 2044-ton steamship which was wrecked at Point Hicks, in what is now Croajingolong National Park. Helmed by a Captain Aitken, it left Geelong bound for Sydney on 23 December 1937, but ran aground in heavy fog. All crew on board were rescued after a distress signal brought assistance from other ships.

Remnants from the wreckage are still visible to walkers in the area.

<text>A three-letter acronym (TLA), or three-letter abbreviation, is as the phrase suggests an abbreviation consisting of three letters. The abbreviation for TLA, TLA, has a special status among abbreviations and to some is humorous since abbreviations that are three-letters long are very common and TLA is, in fact, a TLA. 

&quot;TLA&quot; is autological.

Most TLAs are initialisms (the initial letter of each word of a phrase), but most are not acronyms in the strict sense since they are pronounced by saying each letter, as in &quot;APA&quot; . Some are true acronyms (pronounced as a word) such as CAT (as in CAT scan) which is pronounced as the animal.

==History and origins==
The exact phrase &quot;three-letter acronym&quot; appeared in the sociology literature in 1975. Three-letter acronyms were used as mnemonics in biological sciences, from 1977 and their practical advantage was promoted by Weber in 1982. They are used in many other fields, but the term TLA is particularly associated with computing. In 1980, the manual for the Sinclair ZX81 home computer used and explained TLA. The specific generation of three-letter acronyms in computing was mentioned in a JPL report of 1982. In 1988, in a paper titled &quot;On the Cruelty of Really Teaching Computing Science&quot;, eminent computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra wrote (disparagingly), &quot;No endeavour is respectable these days without a TLA&quot; By 1992 it was in a Microsoft handbook.

==Combinatorics==
The number of possible three-letter abbreviations using the 26 letters of the alphabet from A to Z (AAA, AAB, ... to ZZY, ZZZ) is 26 × 26 × 26 = 17,576. Allowing a single digit 0-9 increases this by 26 × 26 × 10 = 6,760 for each position, such as 2FA, P2P, or WW2, giving a total of 37,856 such three-character strings.

Out of the 17,576 possible TLAs that can be created using 3 uppercase letters, at least 94% of them had been used at least once in a dataset of 18 million scientific article abstracts. Three-letter acronyms are the most common type of acronym in scientific research papers, with acronyms of length 3 being twice as common as those of length 2 or 4.

In standard English, WWW is the TLA whose pronunciation requires the most syllables—typically nine. The usefulness of a TLA typically comes from its being quicker to say than the phrase it represents; however saying &#x27;WWW&#x27; in English requires three times as many syllables as the phrase it is meant to abbreviate (World Wide Web). &quot;WWW&quot; is sometimes abbreviated to &quot;dubdubdub&quot; in speech.

<text>Armand David, CM (7 September 1826, Espelette – 10 November 1900, Paris) was a Lazarist missionary Catholic priest as well as a zoologist and a botanist from the French Basque Country. 

Several species, such as Père David&#x27;s deer, are named after him — being French for Father David.

==Biography==

Born in Espelette near Bayonne, in the north of Basque Country, in Pyrénées-Atlantiques &quot;département&quot; of France, he entered the Congregation of the Mission in 1848, having already displayed great fondness for the natural sciences. Ordained in 1851, he was in 1862 sent to Peking, where he began a collection of material for a museum of natural history, mainly zoological, but in which botany, geology, and palaeontology were also well represented.

At the request of the French government, important specimens from his collection were sent to Paris and aroused the greatest interest. The Jardin des Plantes commissioned him to undertake scientific journeys through China to make further collections. He succeeded in obtaining many specimens of hitherto unknown animals and plants, and the value of his comprehensive collections for the advance of systematic zoology and especially for the advancement of animal geography received universal recognition from the scientific community at Paris in April, 1888. He had found in China all together 200 species of wild animals, of which 63 were hitherto unknown to zoologists, and 807 species of birds, 65 of which had not been described before. He made a large collection of reptiles, amphibians, and fishes and handed it over to specialists for further study. Also, a large number of moths and insects, many of them hitherto unknown, were brought to the museum of the Jardin des Plantes. What Father David&#x27;s scientific journeys meant for botany may be inferred from the fact that among the rhododendrons which he collected no less than fifty-two new species were found and among the primulae about forty, while the Western Mountains of China furnished an even greater number of hitherto unknown species of gentian.

The most notable of the animals &#x27;found&#x27; by David, which were hitherto unknown to Europeans, were the giant panda in Baoxing County and Père David&#x27;s deer. The latter had disappeared with the exception of a few preserved in the gardens of the emperor of China, but David succeeded in securing a specimen and sent it to Europe. David also sent back the first emerald ash borer specimen. In the midst of his work as a naturalist Father David did not neglect his missionary labours, and was noted for his careful devotion to his religious duties and for his obedience to every detail of his order&#x27;s rules.

==Eponymy==
The plants &quot;Buddleja davidii&quot; and &quot;Ulmus davidiana&quot;, the David Elm, were named for him, and also &quot;Lilium davidii&quot;. The fish &quot;Sarcocheilichthys davidi&quot; was named in his honor by Henri Émile Sauvage in 1878, because Père David collected the type specimen. Père David&#x27;s deer (&quot;Elaphurus davidianus&quot;) was likewise named after him by Alphonse Milne-Edwards.

Père David&#x27;s Rat Snake (&quot;Elaphe davidi&quot;) was named in his honor by Henri Émile Sauvage in 1884.

<text>Guus Kouwenhoven, often misspelled as Gus Kouwenhoven or Guus van Kouwenhoven (born 15 February 1942, &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch) is a Dutch arms dealer convicted for arms trafficking in Liberia during the presidency of Charles Taylor.

==Deported from the US==
In the 1970s, Kouwenhoven was sentenced to two years in prison in the United States after being caught in a Federal Bureau of Investigation sting operation along with his then business partner Peter Rombouts while attempting to sell 6 stolen artworks, including a Rembrandt. In this case he was sentenced to two years incarceration but served only 17 days before being deported from the US.

==Involvement in Liberia==
Kouwenhoven started his career in Liberia in the 1980s as the manager of Hotel Africa and later on headed the Oriental Timber Corporation (OTC), the main timber company in Liberia in the early 2000s, during the Liberian Civil War. The company was used as a cover for arms smuggling from China and Serbia, via Viktor Bout an arms trader from the former Soviet Union who frequented the hotel and used it as a hub for arms sales all over Africa. Syrian-born Richard (Amar) Chichakli was the financial manager of Bout&#x27;s arms operations.

The United Nations issued an order in 2001 banning him from traveling because of arms trafficking, and banned arms trade with him.

The three, Taylor himself, Kouwenhoven and Bout were arrested within a single year, while Chichakli evaded arrest for several years, and was caught in Australia in 2013.
==Trials==
Kouwenhoven was arrested in the Netherlands on 18 March 2005 and stood trial at the Court of First Instance in The Hague, starting 24 April 2006, charged with arms smuggling and war crimes in Liberia in the 90s, for which the Dutch public prosecutors sought a 20-year jail sentence and a fine of €450,000. The court tried to summon Charles Taylor to testify against Kouwenhoven. On 7 June 2006 Kouwenhoven was sentenced to 8 years in jail for arms smuggling. The court did not find him guilty of war crimes. Both the public prosecutors and Kouwenhoven sought a higher court appeal and Kouwenhoven was released in March 2007 in anticipation of his new trial. The Court of Appeal in The Hague acquitted him of all charges on 10 March 2008 and sharply criticized the work of the prosecution.

The prosecution appealed the acquittal to the Supreme Court on 20 March 2008. In April 2010 the Supreme Court ordered a re-trial at the court in Den Bosch. In November 2014, the court in Den Bosch was to hear arguments for dismissal as there were no witnesses available to testify. The Prosecutor Cara Pronk-Jordan wished to have the earlier anonymous interviews used as evidence. Kouwenhoven fled to South Africa in December 2016, claiming medical grounds. On 21 April 2017, Kouwenhoven was convicted in absentia to a 19-year jail sentence for illegal arms trafficking and complicity in war crimes in Liberia and Guinea. A day after this conviction, “Interpol despatched a Red List Notice to the Interpol NCB in Pretoria” requesting that he be provisionally arrested.

Kouwenhoven was arrested on a Dutch warrant on Friday 8 December 2017 at his home in Fresnaye, Cape Town, by the South African Police and appeared before the Cape Town Magistrate&#x27;s Court from 12 December 2017. In February 2020 the magistrate ruled &quot;with great regret&quot; that Kouwenhoven could not be extradited to the Netherlands in terms of South Africa&#x27;s Extradition Act because the offences were not committed in the Netherlands.

<text>William Alexander &quot;Bill&quot; Blaikie (June 19, 1951 – September 24, 2022) was a Canadian politician. He served as a member of Parliament (MP) from 1979 to 2008, representing Elmwood—Transcona and its antecedent ridings in the House of Commons of Canada for the federal New Democratic Party. Following his retirement from federal politics, he was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 2009 until 2011, representing the Winnipeg division of Elmwood as a member of the New Democratic Party of Manitoba, and served as Minister of Conservation and Government House Leader.

Blaikie had the longest continuous parliamentary record in the 38th and 39th Canadian Parliaments, and in this capacity served as the Dean of the House. He was a member of the King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada. Blaikie was the Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada from 2006 to 2008.

Prior to the 2011 Manitoba election, he announced that he was retiring from political life.

==Early life and career==
Blaikie was born to a working-class family in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on June 19, 1951. His parents were Kathleen Taylor and Robert Blaikie. He had two brothers, Bobby and Donnie (both of whom predeceased him), and a sister, Kim. His maternal grandfather, Alexander Taylor, was an emigrant from County Antrim in Northern Ireland who served as the police and fire chief and, in the last years of his life, justice of the peace for Transcona, during which time it was an independent community. His father was employed by Canadian National for over forty years, at first as a machinist and later in management. Blaikie served in The Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada from 1967 to 1972, and was a labourer on and off with the Canadian National Railway from 1969 to 1974 while attending university. He was a member of the Young Progressive Conservatives in high school, and joined the NDP in 1971.

Blaikie earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy and religious studies from the University of Winnipeg (1973), and a Master of Divinity from Emmanuel College, Toronto School of Theology (1977). He was ordained as a minister in the United Church of Canada on June 4, 1978, and subsequently became a politician in the social gospel tradition of such figures as J. S. Woodsworth, Tommy Douglas and Stanley Knowles. From 1977 to 1979, he worked as the Minister/Director of North End Community Ministry, an inner-city outreach ministry of the United Church located within the historic Stella Ave. Mission in Winnipeg.

==Federal parliamentarian==
The New Democratic Party has never formed the national government in Canada, and Blaikie served in Ottawa for 29 years as an opposition MP. He held many important critic portfolios, and was respected by members of all parties for his personal integrity and conviction.

===Clark, Trudeau and Turner governments (1979–84)===
Blaikie was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1979 federal election, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative MP Dean Whiteway (who had previously been elected in the riding of Selkirk, which was eliminated by redistribution). The Progressive Conservatives won a minority government under the leadership of Joe Clark, but lost a parliamentary motion of non-confidence later in the year. A new election was held in early 1980, in which the Liberal Party won a majority government under the leadership of Pierre Trudeau, who returned as Prime Minister of Canada. Blaikie was comfortably re-elected in his own riding.

Blaikie was appointed the NDP&#x27;s Social Policy Critic in 1979, and was promoted to Health Critic in 1980. He was instrumental in forcing Minister of Health, Monique Bégin, to enact the Canada Health Act in 1984, to deal with the crisis in medicare due to user fees and physicians&#x27; extra-billing. In her memoirs, Bégin wrote that Blaikie waged &quot;guerilla warfare&quot; in the House of Commons over the issue. He also served as caucus chair in 1983–84.

===Mulroney and Campbell governments (1984–93)===
The Progressive Conservatives won a landslide majority government in the 1984 federal election under Brian Mulroney, defeating the Liberals under their new leader John Turner. Blaikie was again returned for his riding, and was appointed NDP Environment Critic in the new parliament. He opposed the Mulroney government&#x27;s budget cuts and was strongly critical of Environment Minister, Suzanne Blais-Grenier, saying, &quot;It is clear she does not think about the environment. She thinks about the deficit.&quot; He called for Blais-Grenier&#x27;s resignation in June 1985, after she remarked that national parks could be opened to mining and logging. In the same year, Blaikie brought forward a private member&#x27;s bill calling for a three-year moratorium on the construction and export of nuclear power stations, to be followed by a national referendum on any further development.

Blaikie spoke against a bill that proposed the return of capital punishment in 1987, saying that its passage would mark &quot;a step toward not a less violent society, but a more violent society&quot;. The bill was defeated in a free vote. He was also an opponent of Sunday shopping law reform in this period, arguing that it interfered with a community&#x27;s right to determine common rest times.

He was promoted to External Affairs Critic in September 1987. One of his first major policy statements in this portfolio was to call for Canada to stop allowing American cruise missile tests over its territory. He was also critical of Canada&#x27;s proposed Free Trade Agreement with the United States, and released a document entitled &quot;A Time To Choose Canada, the New Democrats&#x27; Trade Option&quot; with fellow MP Steven Langdon in February 1988. He also served as co-chairman of the NDP&#x27;s international affairs committee, and held consultation meetings on whether or not the party should reaffirm its traditional opposition to Canadian membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Blaikie considered running for the leadership of the New Democratic Party of Manitoba in 1988, following the surprise resignation of Howard Pawley. He eventually chose not to run, and did not endorse any other candidate. He was retained as the NDP&#x27;s External Affairs Critic after the Progressive Conservatives won a second consecutive majority government in the 1988 federal election, and was also chosen as his party&#x27;s spokesman for federal–provincial relations and the Constitution. He was an international observer during Namibia&#x27;s transformation to independence in 1989, and for Lithuania&#x27;s first multi-party elections in early 1990.

There were rumours that Blaikie would seek the federal New Democratic Party leadership after Ed Broadbent&#x27;s resignation in 1989, but he declined to run and instead supported Simon de Jong, whom he described as having the greatest awareness of environmental issues. When de Jong was eliminated on the second ballot at a delegated convention, Blaikie moved to the camp of Audrey McLaughlin, the eventual winner.

Blaikie was appointed NDP Taxation Critic in 1990. He opposed the Mulroney government&#x27;s decision to cut social programs to pay down the deficit, calling instead for a tightening of tax loopholes. He was given further responsibilities as Transport Critic, and spoke against proposed job cuts at Canadian National.

===Chrétien government (1993–2003)===
====In parliament====
Blaikie&#x27;s closest election came in 1993, when the Liberal Party under Jean Chrétien defeated the Progressive Conservatives under new leader Kim Campbell to win a majority government. The New Democratic Party&#x27;s support base had fallen in this period, due to unpopular decisions made by the provincial NDP governments of Bob Rae in Ontario and Michael Harcourt in British Columbia. Blaikie defeated Liberal candidate Art Miki by only 219 votes in Winnipeg—Transcona while his party fell from 44 to 9 seats nationally. Between 1993 and 1997, Blaikie was the only New Democratic Party MP to represent a riding east of Saskatchewan. He was appointed NDP Critic for Foreign Affairs and Trade after the election, and served another term as caucus chairman from 1993 to 1996.

In early 1994, Blaikie won unanimous support in the House of Commons for a Private Member&#x27;s Bill calling for the government to officially recognize Canadians who served in the Dieppe Raid in World War II. He initially proposed that a special medal be struck, but later accepted a Liberal amendment for a &quot;distinctive decoration&quot;. He was disappointed with the final result, a simple silver bar with ribbon attachment that was given to all service personnel from 1939 to 1943. Blaikie voted against the Chrétien government&#x27;s gun registry in 1995, arguing that it did not address the real problems of gun-related violence.

There were again rumours that Blaikie would run for the NDP leadership in 1995, but he declined and gave his support to Lorne Nystrom. When Nystrom was eliminated at the party&#x27;s convention, Blaikie shifted his support to the winner, Alexa McDonough.

The duties of NDP MPs were shuffled after the leadership convention. Blaikie was named as House Leader, while continuing as International Trade Critic and adding the Intergovernmental Affairs portfolio. He continued to hold these parliamentary roles after the 1997 election, in which the Liberals won a second majority government and the NDP made a partial recovery to 21 seats.

Blaikie was re-elected to a seventh term in 2000, as the Liberals won a third majority government under Chrétien. He retained his position as House Leader and Intergovernment Affairs Critic, and gained additional duties as critic for Parliamentary Reform, Justice and the Solicitor-General. He played a key role in getting the NDP Caucus to support the Clarity Act in 2000, after securing amendments that were important to First Nations groups in Quebec.

====Ideological views====
Blaikie emerged as a prominent critic of economic globalization during the mid-1990s. In 1996, he wrote that new rules governing the World Trade Organization would shift oversight of public policy from elected governments to unelected trade bureaucrats. He expressed similar concerns about the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) two years later, arguing that it put the rights of investors ahead of workers, environments, societies, and cultures. He wrote the NDP Minority Report on the MAI, which was published in &quot;Dismantling Democracy&quot; (edited by Andrew Jackson and Matthew Sanger).

Blaikie wrote a 1994 editorial calling for the Bank of Canada to hold a larger portion of the national debt at low interest rates, as it did until the mid-1970s, in order for Canada to reduce its deficit while maintaining its core social programs. In 1998, he led a national campaign against proposed mergers for Canada&#x27;s major banks.

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, the New Democratic Party members were divided as to the party&#x27;s position on the Canadian political spectrum. Some wanted to take the party into a more centrist direction, similar to Tony Blair&#x27;s &quot;Third Way&quot; in Britain, while others sought to move in a radical left-wing direction. Blaikie was not closely affiliated with either camp. He opposed Blair&#x27;s ideological approach on the grounds that it was too closely aligned with corporate interests. He participated in anti-globalization protests in Seattle and Quebec City but also criticized the extra-parliamentary left&#x27;s tactics, saying that protests would never bring economic change without mobilization in the political sphere. He opposed the New Politics Initiative at the NDP&#x27;s 2001 convention, calling instead for a renewal of the existing party organization.

====Leadership campaign====
Blaikie was the first declared candidate in the 2003 leadership election. He called for a renewed focus on health care, natural resources and labour standards. Blaikie was seen as a representative of the party&#x27;s moderate left, fitting ideologically between the centrist Lorne Nystrom and the more left-wing Jack Layton. He was supported by MPs Pat Martin, Judy Wasylycia-Leis, Bev Desjarlais, Wendy Lill, Yvon Godin and Dick Proctor, Manitoba Premier Gary Doer, New Democratic Party of Ontario leader Howard Hampton, and several former MPs including Simon de Jong, Dawn Black, Ian Waddell and Howard McCurdy. In declaring his candidacy, he said,
The NDP&#x27;s 2003 leadership convention was the first to be determined by a partial &quot;one member, one vote&quot; system in which all members of the NDP were eligible to cast ballots. Blaikie finished second to Jack Layton, who appointed him as Deputy Leader after the convention. As Layton did not have a seat in the Commons, Blaikie also served as the NDP&#x27;s parliamentary leader until the 2004 federal election. This led to his being sworn in as a member of the Privy Council. He was also named as the NDP&#x27;s National Defence Critic, and was front and centre in pushing the Liberals to not participate in the Iraq War, in opposing Canadian participation in ballistic missile defence, and in asking questions about the rules of engagement and changing role of Canadian troops in Afghanistan.

===Martin government (2003–06)===
Paul Martin succeeded Jean Chrétien as leader of the Liberal Party in November 2003 and as Prime Minister of Canada in December 2003, called a new election for June 2004. During this campaign, Blaikie openly disagreed with Layton&#x27;s proposal that the Clarity Act be repealed. The Liberals were reduced to a minority government, and the NDP increased its representation from 14 to 19 seats. Blaikie continued as Deputy Leader and Defence Critic, and was also named as Health Critic. Notwithstanding their disagreement over the Clarity Act, Blaikie said that he enjoyed a good working relationship with Layton in parliament.

===Harper government (2006–08)===
The Conservative Party under Stephen Harper won a minority government in the 2006 federal election. Following the resumption of parliament in April, Blaikie was named as Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons. This position largely removed him from the day-to-day business of House debates, and put him in the role of a non-partisan overseer.

===Parliamentary reform===
Blaikie was an advocate for the reform of parliamentary institutions throughout his time in parliament. He served as second vice-chairman of an all-party committee on parliamentary reform in 1985, which among other things made it easier for private member&#x27;s bills to come to a vote. He took part in another such committee in 1992, which issued a thirty-page report calling for more free votes, reforms to the parliamentary Question Period, and a streamlined process for passing legislation. He participated in a third such committee in 2001, although he indicated that he was disappointed with its results.

===Retirement===
On March 15, 2007, Blaikie announced that he would not be a candidate in the next federal election. He accepted a position as adjunct professor of Theology and Politics at the University of Winnipeg, and announced plans to write a book on the relationship between faith and politics. When he left the House of Commons in September 2008, he wrote an editorial that criticized parliament&#x27;s declining standards, referring specifically to a rise in &quot;character assassination, simulated indignation, and trivial pursuit over substantial debate&quot;.

Blaikie was a contributor to &quot;Northern Lights: An Anthology of Contemporary Christian Writing in Canada&quot;, which was published shortly after the 2008 federal election.

==Provincial politics and later life==
In December 2008, Blakie announced that he would seek the NDP nomination for the provincial division of Elmwood, which had been vacated by Jim Maloway, Blaikie&#x27;s own successor in the federal riding of Elmwood—Transcona. He won the nomination unopposed, after two previously declared candidates withdrew to support him. Both Blaikie and Maloway have rejected the suggestion that they planned to &quot;swap&quot; their federal and provincial seats, and Blaikie has said that he returned to political life on the request of Premier Gary Doer. He was elected without difficulty in late March 2009, and formally joined the legislature the following month. On November 3, 2009, Blaikie was appointed to the cabinet of Premier Greg Selinger as the Minister of Conservation and Government House Leader.

As Conservation Minister, Blaikie stewarded the development of five new provincial parks in Manitoba in 2011 and played a significant role in the government&#x27;s attempts to protect the boreal forest on the east side of Lake Winnipeg. A year later, he was conferred the Crocus Award from Nature Manitoba for his role in creating the five provincial parks.

On July 11, 2011, Blaikie announced that he would not be re-offering at the October 4 provincial election and would be retiring from political life.

Blaikie was appointed to the Order of Canada in November 2020 &quot;for his lifelong contributions to parliamentary service and for his steadfast commitment to progressive change and social activism.&quot; Amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, he was invested virtually on February 26, 2021.

Blaikie died from kidney cancer at his home in Winnipeg on September 24, 2022, at the age of 71. His funeral was held on 2 October 2022 at a church in the Winnipeg suburb of Transcona, which was attended by family members, close friends, as well as federal NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, provincial NDP leader Wab Kinew and former Manitoba premier Greg Selinger.

<doc id="270916" wikidata="Q4806568" url="?curid=270916" title="Asian American Journalists Association">
<text>The Asian American Journalists Association (AAJA) is a 501(c)3 nonprofit educational and professional organization based in Washington, D.C., with more than 1,500 members and 21 chapters across the United States and Asia. The current president is &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter Nicole Dungca. The executive director is Naomi Tacuyan Underwood.

The organization&#x27;s goals are:

* To provide a means of association and support among Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) journalists, and to advance AAPI journalists as news managers and media executives.
* To provide encouragement, information, advice and scholarship assistance to AAPI students who aspire to professional journalism careers.
* To provide to the AAPI community an awareness of news media and an understanding of how to gain fair access.
* To research and point out when news media organizations stray from accuracy and fairness in the coverage of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and AAPI issues.

The organization is open to anyone who works in media and identifies as Asian American or is an ally. AAJA&#x27;s diverse membership includes broadcast anchors, print reporters, editors, producers, videographers, columnists, photojournalists, freelancers, academics, professors, students as well as those who work in film and online media. The membership also consists of many associates in business and public relations sectors. Close to one-third of AAJA&#x27;s members are students.

== History ==
The Asian American Journalists Association (AAJA) was founded in 1981 by several Los Angeles–based Asian American journalists: Bill Sing, Nancy Yoshihara, and David Kishiyama (from T&quot;he Los Angeles Times&quot;), Frank Kwan and Tritia Toyota (from KNBC-TV News), and Dwight Chuman (from &quot;Rafu Shimpo&quot;, the Japanese-American newspaper). Their goal was to support greater participation by Asian Americans in the news media and to ensure fair and accurate portrayals. The AAJA also aimed to encourage high school and college students through scholarship and internships as a way of increasing Asian American representation in the journalistic profession. The founders also wanted to enhance and improve the representation Asian Americans in mainstream mass media.

Inspired by the creation of the National Association of Black Journalists in 1975 as well as the Los Angeles–based California Chicano News Media Association, Sing, a 23-year-old Los Angeles Times reporter at the time, serendipitously met KNBC-TV anchor Tritia Toyota at a student night at UCLA in 1981 and consequently mentioned the idea of forming a similar organization. The two would soon become the leaders of the Original Six who got together in Los Angeles&#x27; Little Tokyo Service Center to form AAJA. The other members of the Original Six were David Kishiyama and Nancy Yoshihara of the Los Angeles Times, TV producer Frank Kwan, and Dwight Chuman, an editor of a local Japanese American newspaper.

Envisioned as a professional and educational group, AAJA attracted 50 Asian American journalists at its first social event. &quot;There were more Asian American journalists under one roof than I ever imagined were in the business,&quot; said Kishiyama. &quot;We all immediately drew strength from one another, and the feeling of isolation I had felt evaporated overnight.&quot;

Building on the momentum of the first social event, the founders knew they had to spread the word that AAJA was out there. A scholarship banquet was organized and NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw was the featured speaker for the event. More than 350 supporters, including city officials, media company representatives, and community folks attended the banquet. The dinner raised $18,000 for scholarships.

Despite the banquet&#x27;s success, there was still skepticism at the time among journalists who were leery about being part of AAJA or similar organizations. The founders understood the predicament of being professionally independent and being part of an organization that was political in nature. But it was also around this time that some of the nation&#x27;s newsrooms were starting to develop programs to recruit minorities into the industry. Many of the newsrooms seeking help in reaching parity in their newsrooms turned to minority journalism organizations like AAJA, the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, which was founded in 1984.

By 1985, AAJA had 100 dues-paying members scattered across the country. AAJA&#x27;s first executive director, Karen Seriguchi, was hired and soon chapters were formed in San Francisco, Sacramento, Washington, D.C., Hawaii and San Diego. By July 1987, membership reached 350 and more chapters were formed, including Detroit, Chicago, New York, Portland, New England, Florida and Denver.

== Chapters ==
There are 19 chapters in the United States and one chapter representing Asia members. California alone has four chapters: Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, and Sacramento. In addition to Los Angeles, the largest chapters are New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Washington, D.C. and the Asia chapter. Members who do not geographically reside in any of the chapter cities are considered at-large members and include journalists spanning the globe from Paris to Bangladesh.
== Affinity groups ==
AAJA affinity groups are specialized groups of AAJA members organized by vocation or interest, each led by a director or co-director. They strive to recruit new members and identify and pursue training and networking opportunities that meet members’ evolving and unique needs, as well as connect current AAJA members regardless of geography or career level.

== National conference ==
AAJA holds an annual conference each summer in the United States where more than 800 Asian American journalists and allies attend each year for the workshops, plenaries, keynote speakers, job fair, and awards banquet. The three-day conference is the largest gathering of Asian journalists in the world. The conference has been held annually since 1987. Speakers, including keynote speakers, have included news pioneers Al Neuharth and Connie Chung, former United States President Bill Clinton, former United States Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, civil rights leader John Lewis and former international correspondent-anchor for NBC News Ann Curry.

Yearly sponsors of the conference have included the major network news stations (ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox), newspapers (The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal), sports media (ESPN), online media (Vox Media, Bleacher Report) as well as universities with journalism programs (Columbia University, CUNY, University of Southern California).

Cities with large media industries as well as large Asian populations are often chosen as hosts. Recent host cities include Atlanta, Houston, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington D.C. and New York City. The AAJA 2024 conference will be held in Austin, Texas from August 7 through August 11.

The Asia chapter holds its own conference annually.

== National programs ==
AAJA has several programs that cater to different experience levels within its membership, starting from high school to mid-career professionals. The programs run annually with application windows open either at the end of the calendar year, or at the beginning of the new year. Programs are funded with foundation support and contributions from media sponsors.

=== VOICES (College Program) ===
Voices is a summer multimedia journalism fellowship for undergraduate and graduate college students. Each year, a group of students are selected to work remotely part-time to report on issues related to Asian Americans. Professional mentors guide students through their assignments and provide a newsroom experience. Students also attend remote trainings while they work on their assignments in groups. Students that participate in the Voices newsroom are invited to the AAJA National Convention at the end of the summer to present their reports and to attend the convention. Travel and lodging are covered for students who are selected to participate.

Since its founding in 1990, Voices has graduated hundreds of students who would go on to work in the media industry. The program&#x27;s cohort of graduates include 27 published authors, 15 Emmy Award winners, seven Pulitzer Prize recipients, four Edward R. Murrow Award winners and two Peabody Award winners.

=== JCamp (High School Program) ===
JCamp is a selective national journalism program for high school students. It strives to confront the lack of diversity within the industry, in regards to race, religion, identity, geography, sexual orientation and socioeconomic status. The six-day training brings together a multicultural group of teenagers to sharpen journalism skills and work together in a unique learning environment. The curriculum consists of interactive workshops, hands-on training and field trips that emphasize cross-cultural communication, ethics, leadership and networking. Students demonstrate a keen interest in broadcast, newspaper, magazine, photojournalism or online media. JCamp is open to high school freshmen, sophomores and juniors from all backgrounds. There is no fee to apply and all expenses are covered.

The program was founded in 2001 by Star Tribune reporter Neal Justin, Sacramento Bee reporter Josh Freedom du Lac and Philadelphia Daily News reporter Mark Angeles as a response to the media industry&#x27;s diversity crisis. More than 750 students have graduated JCamp since its inception, and alumni have been recognized with the highest honors in the news business. Approximately 75% of the program&#x27;s graduates have gone on to pursue a journalism degree after graduating high school.

Speakers have included Hoda Kotb, co-host of NBC&#x27;s Today Show; Kevin Merida, editor-in-chief of The Undefeated; Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., publisher of The New York Times; Jemele Hill, writer for The Atlantic; Wesley Lowery, correspondent for 60 Minutes; Seung Min Kim, White House reporter at the Washington Post; Cheryl Diaz Meyer, Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer; Byron Pitts, co-anchor of Nightline; Chuck Todd, host of Meet the Press; talk show host Jimmy Kimmel; Jill Abramson, former executive editor of The New York Times; Carl Bernstein, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Watergate reporter; Tucker Carlson, anchor for Fox News; David Rhodes, former president of CBS News; Soledad O&#x27;Brien, former CNN anchor; Bob Schieffer, former moderator of Face the Nation; Gwen Ifill, former co-host of PBS NewsHour; and Dennis Swanson, creator of The Oprah Winfrey Show.

MSNBC anchor Richard Lui, former CNN anchor Joie Chen, Politico deputy editor Clea Benson, former AAJA President Paul Cheung, Minnesota Public Radio President Duchesne Drew, Associated Press reporter Bobby Calvan and Star Tribune photo editor Kyndell Harkness have all taught at the program. Alumni have been recognized with the highest honors in journalism, including more than a dozen Emmy Awards, the Peabody Award and the Pulitzer Prize. Alums include filmmaker Jeff Orlowski, news anchor Terrell Brown, Washington Post reporter Arelis Hernandez, Wall Street Journal photo editor Timmy Huynh, ESPN reporter Brett Okamoto, CNN producer Julia Chan, CNN reporter Brian Fung, The Courier-Journal reporter Alfred Miller, Los Angeles Times reporter Sandhya Kambhampati, filmmaker Adam Khalil, reporter Taylor Mirfendereski and fitness entrepreneur Jackelyn Ho.

=== Executive Leadership Program (ELP) ===
The Executive Leadership Program is a week-long professional development workshop committed to journalistic excellence and leadership training. The program provides targeted professional development to diverse, high-potential, ambitious, and community-minded professionals. ELP also provides follow-up trainings for graduates at the annual AAJA National Convention. The program is open to all journalists who apply, regardless of membership to AAJA.

The program has trained more than 500 media professionals since 1995. In 2018, ELP was held at the City University of New York (CUNY). In 2019, the 24th class of ELP held its program at ABC News in New York City. Also in 2019, the program expanded to include an inaugural ELP Asia with the program held in Hong Kong.

The yearlong mentoring program pairs mentees with experienced mentors in the media industry in the United States as well as in Asia, through AAJA&#x27;s Asia chapter. Applications for both mentors and mentees usually open by the end of the calendar year, with matches announced by March of the following year. Several factors are used in determining mentor/mentee pairings, including geography, gender, medium (print, online, broadcast, photography, etc.), and career interests. In recent years, Mentor Match has been able to provide mentors who work outside of traditional newsroom positions, including those who work as data journalists or as documentary film producers.

In 2018, 130 mentor/mentee matches were made with applications coming from 27 states and internationally. Out of the mentors in the 2018 class, 51% had more than 10 years of experience. On the other end, 43% of mentees were students and 49% had less than five years of experience.

== MediaWatch ==
AAJA MediaWatch is a civic engagement committee consisted of AAJA members who are media professionals. The committee seeks to hold media organizations accountable to standards of accuracy and fairness in the coverage of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and their issues. In consultation with AAJA&#x27;s president, the all-volunteer committee considers and issues statements on AAJA&#x27;s behalf.

In 2016, AAJA MediaWatch issued a statement demanding an apology from Fox News for a segment aired on Oct. 3rd that mocked Asian Americans in New York&#x27;s Chinatown. The segment by Jesse Watters of &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; was called &quot;offensive&quot; by The Washington Post and Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii said Watters &quot;should be ashamed.&quot; AAJA also met privately with an “O’Reilly Factor” executive producer, along with other national and local community leaders, at the Museum of Chinese in America in New York City.

AAJA MediaWatch issued guidance in February 2020 urging news outlets to refrain from images and language that fuel xenophobia and racism amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Following that in March, MediaWatch issued a joint statement along with other media organization partners denouncing the escalating violence and anti-Asian rhetoric aimed at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, including journalists, amid the pandemic.

== Achievements ==
AAJA is one of the founding organizations and a partner organization of along with the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ), the National Association of Hispanic Journalists (NAHJ), and the Indigenous Journalists Association (IJA).

In 2019, the Features forum of the AAJA teamed up with the African American Film Critics Association (AAFCA), GALECA: The Society of LGBTQ Entertainment Critics, the Latino Entertainment Journalists Association (LEJA), the Online Association of Female Film Critics (OAFFC) and Time&#x27;s Up Entertainment to form the Critics Groups for Equality in Media to help foster greater diversity in entertainment journalism through various initiatives including a &quot;watchdog&quot; grading system.

On April 2, 2021, the Los Angeles chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists co-sponsored an event celebrating the AAJA&#x27;s 40th anniversary, calling the organization a &quot;vital resource for journalists reporting on the rise of anti-Asian racism and hate crimes.&quot;

<doc id="270918" wikidata="Q581601" url="?curid=270918" title="Martingale (betting system)">
<text>A martingale is a class of betting strategies that originated from and were popular in 18th-century France. The simplest of these strategies was designed for a game in which the gambler wins the stake if a coin comes up heads and loses if it comes up tails. The strategy had the gambler double the bet after every loss, so that the first win would recover all previous losses plus win a profit equal to the original stake. Thus the strategy is an instantiation of the St. Petersburg paradox.

Since a gambler will almost surely eventually flip heads, the martingale betting strategy is certain to make money for the gambler provided they have infinite wealth and there is no limit on money earned in a single bet. However, no gambler has infinite wealth, and the exponential growth of the bets can bankrupt unlucky gamblers who choose to use the martingale, causing a catastrophic loss. Despite the fact that the gambler usually wins a small net reward, thus appearing to have a sound strategy, the gambler&#x27;s expected value remains zero because the small probability that the gambler will suffer a catastrophic loss exactly balances with the expected gain. In a casino, the expected value is negative, due to the house&#x27;s edge. Additionally, as the likelihood of a string of consecutive losses is higher than common intuition suggests, martingale strategies can bankrupt a gambler quickly.

The martingale strategy has also been applied to roulette, as the probability of hitting either red or black is close to 50%.

==Intuitive analysis==

The fundamental reason why all martingale-type betting systems fail is that no amount of information about the results of past bets can be used to predict the results of a future bet with accuracy better than chance. In mathematical terminology, this corresponds to the assumption that the win–loss outcomes of each bet are independent and identically distributed random variables, an assumption which is valid in many realistic situations. It follows from this assumption that the expected value of a series of bets is equal to the sum, over all bets that could potentially occur in the series, of the expected value of a potential bet times the probability that the player will make that bet. In most casino games, the expected value of any individual bet is negative, so the sum of many negative numbers will also always be negative.

The martingale strategy fails even with unbounded stopping time, as long as there is a limit on earnings or on the bets (which is also true in practice). It is only with unbounded wealth, bets &quot;and&quot; time that it could be argued that the martingale becomes a winning strategy.

==Mathematical analysis==
The impossibility of winning over the long run, given a limit of the size of bets or a limit in the size of one&#x27;s bankroll or line of credit, is proven by the optional stopping theorem.

However, without these limits, the martingale betting strategy is certain to make money for the gambler because the chance of at least one coin flip coming up heads approaches one as the number of coin flips approaches infinity.

==Mathematical analysis of a single round==
Let one round be defined as a sequence of consecutive losses followed by either a win, or bankruptcy of the gambler. After a win, the gambler &quot;resets&quot; and is considered to have started a new round. A continuous sequence of martingale bets can thus be partitioned into a sequence of independent rounds. Following is an analysis of the expected value of one round.

Let &quot;q&quot; be the probability of losing (e.g. for American double-zero roulette, it is 20/38 for a bet on black or red). Let &quot;B&quot; be the amount of the initial bet. Let &quot;n&quot; be the finite number of bets the gambler can afford to lose.

The probability that the gambler will lose all &quot;n&quot; bets is &quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot;. When all bets lose, the total loss is

:formula_1

The probability the gambler does not lose all &quot;n&quot; bets is 1 − &quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot;. In all other cases, the gambler wins the initial bet (&quot;B&quot;.) Thus, the expected profit per round is

:formula_2

Whenever &quot;q&quot; &gt; 1/2, the expression 1 − (2&quot;q&quot;)&quot;n&quot; &lt; 0 for all &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0. Thus, for all games where a gambler is more likely to lose than to win any given bet, that gambler is expected to lose money, on average, each round. Increasing the size of wager for each round per the martingale system only serves to increase the average loss.

Suppose a gambler has a 63-unit gambling bankroll. The gambler might bet 1 unit on the first spin. On each loss, the bet is doubled. Thus, taking &quot;k&quot; as the number of preceding consecutive losses, the player will always bet 2k units.

With a win on any given spin, the gambler will net 1 unit over the total amount wagered to that point. Once this win is achieved, the gambler restarts the system with a 1 unit bet.

With losses on all of the first six spins, the gambler loses a total of 63 units. This exhausts the bankroll and the martingale cannot be continued.

In this example, the probability of losing the entire bankroll and being unable to continue the martingale is equal to the probability of 6 consecutive losses: (10/19)6 = 2.1256%. The probability of winning is equal to 1 minus the probability of losing 6 times: 1 − (10/19)6 = 97.8744%.

The expected amount won is (1 × 0.978744) = 0.978744.&lt;br&gt;
The expected amount lost is (63 × 0.021256)= 1.339118.&lt;br&gt;
Thus, the total expected value for each application of the betting system is (0.978744 − 1.339118) = −0.360374 .

In a unique circumstance, this strategy can make sense. Suppose the gambler possesses exactly 63 units but desperately needs a total of 64. Assuming &quot;q&quot; &gt; 1/2 (it is a real casino) and he may only place bets at even odds, his best strategy is bold play: at each spin, he should bet the smallest amount such that if he wins he reaches his target immediately, and if he does not have enough for this, he should simply bet everything. Eventually he either goes bust or reaches his target. This strategy gives him a probability of 97.8744% of achieving the goal of winning one unit vs. a 2.1256% chance of losing all 63 units, and that is the best probability possible in this circumstance. However, bold play is not always the optimal strategy for having the biggest possible chance to increase an initial capital to some desired higher amount. If the gambler can bet arbitrarily small amounts at arbitrarily long odds (but still with the same expected loss of 10/19 of the stake at each bet), and can only place one bet at each spin, then there are strategies with above 98% chance of attaining his goal, and these use very timid play unless the gambler is close to losing all his capital, in which case he does switch to extremely bold play.

==Alternative mathematical analysis==
The previous analysis calculates &quot;expected value&quot;, but we can ask another question: what is the chance that one can play a casino game using the martingale strategy, and avoid the losing streak long enough to double one&#x27;s bankroll?

As before, this depends on the likelihood of losing 6 roulette spins in a row assuming we are betting red/black or even/odd. Many gamblers believe that the chances of losing 6 in a row are remote, and that with a patient adherence to the strategy they will slowly increase their bankroll.

In reality, the odds of a streak of 6 losses in a row are much higher than many people intuitively believe. Psychological studies have shown that since people know that the odds of losing 6 times in a row out of 6 plays are low, they incorrectly assume that in a longer string of plays the odds are also very low. In fact, while the chance of losing 6 times in a row in 6 plays is a relatively low 1.8% on a single-zero wheel, the probability of losing 6 times in a row (i.e. encountering a streak of 6 losses) &quot;at some point&quot; during a string of 200 plays is approximately 84%. Even if the gambler can tolerate betting ~1,000 times their original bet, a streak of 10 losses in a row has an ~11% chance of occurring in a string of 200 plays. Such a loss streak would likely wipe out the bettor, as 10 consecutive losses using the martingale strategy means a loss of 1,023x the original bet. 

These unintuitively risky probabilities raise the bankroll requirement for &quot;safe&quot; long-term martingale betting to infeasibly high numbers. To have an under 10% chance of failing to survive a long loss streak during 5,000 plays, the bettor must have enough to double their bets for 15 losses. This means the bettor must have over 65,500 (2^15-1 for their 15 losses and 2^15 for their 16th streak-ending winning bet) times their original bet size. Thus, a player making 10 unit bets would want to have over 655,000 units in their bankroll (and still have a ~5.5% chance of losing it all during 5,000 plays).

When people are asked to invent data representing 200 coin tosses, they often do not add streaks of more than 5 because they believe that these streaks are very unlikely. This intuitive belief is sometimes referred to as the representativeness heuristic.

==Anti-martingale==
In a classic martingale betting style, gamblers increase bets after each loss in hopes that an eventual win will recover all previous losses. The anti-martingale approach, also known as the reverse martingale, instead increases bets after wins, while reducing them after a loss. The perception is that the gambler will benefit from a winning streak or a &quot;hot hand&quot;, while reducing losses while &quot;cold&quot; or otherwise having a losing streak. As the single bets are independent from each other (and from the gambler&#x27;s expectations), the concept of winning &quot;streaks&quot; is merely an example of gambler&#x27;s fallacy, and the anti-martingale strategy fails to make any money.

<text>A bulletin board (pinboard, pin board, noticeboard, or notice board in British English) is a surface intended for the posting of public messages, for example, to advertise items wanted or for sale, announce events, or provide information. Bulletin boards are often made of a material such as cork to facilitate addition and removal of messages, as well as a writing surface such as blackboard or whiteboard. A bulletin board which combines a pinboard (corkboard) and writing surface is known as a combination bulletin board. Bulletin boards can also be entirely in the digital domain and placed on computer networks so people can leave and erase messages for other people to read and see, as in a bulletin board system.

Bulletin boards are particularly prevalent at universities. They are used by many sports groups and extracurricular groups and anything from local shops to official notices. Dormitory corridors, well-trafficked hallways, lobbies, and freestanding kiosks often have cork boards attached to facilitate the posting of notices. At some universities, lampposts, bollards, trees, and walls often become impromptu posting sites in areas where official boards are sparse in number.

Internet forums are a replacement for traditional bulletin boards. Online bulletin boards are sometimes referred to as message boards. The terms bulletin board, message board and even Internet forum are interchangeable, although often one bulletin board or message board can contain a number of Internet forums or discussion groups. An online board can serve the same purpose as a physical bulletin board, with the added benefit of not being bound by geographical location.

Magnet boards, or magnetic bulletin boards, are a popular substitute for cork boards because they lack the problem of board deterioration from the insertion and removal of pins over time.

== History ==

* 1801: James Pillans, headmaster and geography teacher at the Old High School in Edinburgh, Scotland, is credited with inventing the first modern blackboard.
* 1925: George Brooks of Topeka, Kansas is issued a patent for the use of corkboard as a bulletin board which you could stick tacks into. The patent for George Brooks&#x27; invention, which would become a mainstay in homes and offices around the world, expired in 1941, which then allowed anyone to create and market their own versions of the product.
* 1940: George E. Fox, received a patent for a foam rubber pinboard with cardboard backing
* 1959: W.F. Lewis is issued a patent for a combined chalkboard and bulletin board.
* 1978: The concept of the bulletin board entered the information age when software developers Ward Christensen and Randy Suess launched the first public dialup bulletin board system.
* 2010: Digital signage displays started to replace bulletin boards as a means to reduce clutter and provide real-time information.
* 2010: Pinterest, a content and photo-sharing website meant to serve as online personal bulletin boards, is founded by Ben Silbermann, Paul Sciarra and Evan Sharp.
* 2017: General Enchantment is issued a utility patent for a physical electronic bulletin board system, that includes a physical writing or pinning surface and an electronic display, like a mobile computing device (tablet computer), capable of running (digital signage) software that augments the sharing of analogue information with digital content.

<doc id="270926" wikidata="Q982488" url="?curid=270926" title="Alexander of Constantinople">
<text>Alexander of Constantinople (; 241 – 337) was bishop of Byzantium from 314 and the first bishop of Constantinople from 330 (the city was renamed during his episcopacy in 330). Scholars consider most of the available information on Alexander to be legendary.

== Origin and early life ==
According to the Synaxarion, Alexander was originally from Calabria in Italy and his parents were called George and Vryaine. From a very young age, he was given to God and stayed in a monastery, where he cultivated virtue and became a good labourer of God&#x27;s commands. He was granted divine visions, while for twenty days he stayed completely fasting. But he also stayed naked for four years and fell into thousands of problems because of attacks of the Saracens. In this way, he lived many years traveling around Greece with his pupils Vitalius and Nicephorus.

Alexander was elected as a vicar to assist the aged bishop Metrophanes of Byzantium. According to Gelasius of Cyzicus, Metrophanes was alive during the First Council of Nicaea (325), but could not partake due to his age and ill health, so he sent instead Alexander of Constantinople, whom he destined as his successor. Metrophanes was most likely already dead by then. Alexander succeeded him at the age of 73 in 314.

During his episcopacy, Alexander engaged in debate with pagan philosophers and opposed heresies. He was highly praised by Gregory Nazianzus and Epiphanius of Salamis. Theodoret called him an &quot;apostolic&quot; bishop. Alexander served as bishop for about 23 years, during which time he distinguished himself by his virtues and administrative abilities.

== Arian controversy ==
When the Arian controversy began, Pope Alexander I of Alexandria, the Patriarch of Alexandria, requested his cooperation in combating what he perceived to be heresy. At the Council of Nicaea, Arius and his teachings were condemned.

Later, Arius desired to be received back into the communion of the Church. The Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, having been convinced by the Eusebians, commanded Alexander to formally receive Arius back. According to Socrates of Constantinople, Arius did not in fact repent of his heresy but was equivocating, and Bishop Alexander was aware of this. Alexander, though threatened by the Eusebians with deposition and banishment, persisted in his refusal to admit Arius back into the Church, and shut himself up in the Church of Hagia Irene (which at that time was the cathedral of Constantinople) in fervent prayer that God would take him from this world rather than be forced to restore someone to communion who he feared was only feigning repentance. As it happened, Arius died on his way to the church, before he could be received back into communion.

== Death ==
Alexander did not long survive Arius. On his deathbed he was said to have nominated his vicar, Paul I of Constantinople, as his successor, and to have warned his clergy against Macedonius I of Constantinople, who became bishop of Constantinople in 342 and whose teachings inspired Macedonianism.

After his death, Alexander came to be regarded as a saint of the Church. The service in his honor was printed in Venice in 1771. According to some ancient manuscripts, the feast of Saint Alexander was commemorated on 2 June. Today, his feast day is celebrated annually on 30 August, in a common commemoration with his fellow Patriarchs of Constantinople John IV of Constantinople (582–595, also commemorated on 2 September) and Paul IV of Constantinople (780–784).

<doc id="270930" wikidata="Q646963" url="?curid=270930" title="Lorne Calvert">
<text>Lorne Albert Calvert (born December 24, 1952) is a Canadian politician who served as the 13th premier of Saskatchewan, from 2001 to 2007. Calvert served as leader of the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party and Member of the Legislative Assembly for Saskatoon Riversdale from 2001 to 2009, when he retired. He also served as the MLA for Moose Jaw Wakamow from 1986 to 1999.

Calvert became premier when he was elected NDP leader in 2001 after the retirement of Roy Romanow. Campaigning on the party&#x27;s social democratic legacy, Calvert led the party to a majority government in the 2003 provincial election. His party was defeated in the 2007 election by Brad Wall&#x27;s Saskatchewan Party. Late in Calvert&#x27;s tenure as premier, the provincial economy—buoyed by rapidly rising natural resource prices—began a significant upturn.

==Early life and career==
Calvert was born in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. He received his undergraduate degree in economics at the University of Regina. Initially planning to study law, Calvert ultimately decided to study theology and pursue the ministry within the United Church of Canada. After attending St. Andrew&#x27;s College seminary in Saskatoon, he was ordained as minister of the United Church in 1976 and served as minister of several rural congregations. From 1979 to 1986, Calvert was the minister of the pastoral charge of Zion United Church in Moose Jaw.

== Political career ==

=== NDP MLA (1986–1999) ===
Calvert entered provincial politics ahead of the 1986 provincial election, running as a New Democrat on a platform of prohibiting the construction of a proposed casino in Moose Jaw. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan as the Member (MLA) for the constituency of Moose Jaw South, serving in the Official Opposition to Grant Devine&#x27;s Progressive Conservative government. Calvert was re-elected in the 1991 and 1995 elections, when the NDP was both times elected to majority governments under the leadership of Roy Romanow. Calvert held a number of cabinet positions during his tenure, including as associate minister of health and minister responsible for SaskPower and SaskEnergy; from 1995, he was responsible for two large portfolios as both Minister of Health and Minister of Social Services.

Romanow&#x27;s tenure was noted for its fiscal conservatism, and the NDP&#x27;s embrace of Third Way politics in the 1990s was divisive within the party. Calvert decided not to run in the 1999 election—which resulted in a minority NDP government—and was succeeded by Deb Higgins in the Moose Jaw riding.

=== Premier of Saskatchewan (2001–2007) ===
In late 2000, Romanow announced that he would be retiring from politics, setting the stage for a party leadership race leading directly to the premier&#x27;s office—the first such race since Woodrow Lloyd succeeded Tommy Douglas as NDP leader and premier in 1961. The 2001 contest was highly contested, with seven candidates making it the biggest NDP leadership race in history. It was also the first such election to employ a one-member, one-vote policy, rather than a delegated election. Calvert joined the race, alongside former NDP MP and then-provincial justice minister Chris Axworthy, three sitting cabinet ministers in Buckley Belanger, Joanne Crofford, and Maynard Sonntag, former National Farmers Union president Nettie Wiebe, and former Young New Democrats president Scott Banda. Axworthy was the perceived frontrunner, expected to continue Romanow&#x27;s legacy; Calvert and Wiebe, meanwhile, ran more leftwing campaigns, with Wiebe running an explicitly anti-neoliberal campaign, and Calvert a more traditional social democratic one, advocating for a greater focus on social programs, especially in healthcare and education. Wiebe finished third, and Calvert—who led on every ballot—defeated Axworthy on the final ballot with 58% of nearly 18,000 votes. With the victory, Calvert became premier on February 8, 2001.

After securing the party leadership, Calvert was elected to the legislature in a by-election in Romanow&#x27;s former riding of Saskatoon Riversdale; moving to Saskatoon from Moose Jaw, Calvert campaigned on a pledge to work closely with local community groups.

Calvert took the helm of the NDP at a time when the Saskatchewan Party—a new unified conservative political party established in 1997—appeared on the cusp of a breakthrough after reducing the NDP to a minority government in 1999 with a strong performance in rural Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan Party led polling ahead of the 2003 provincial election. However, Calvert followed through on his promise to significantly increase social spending, particularly in education and healthcare, and persistently drew a stark contrast between his party&#x27;s support for the province&#x27;s major remaining crown corporations and Saskatchewan Party leader Elwin Hermanson&#x27;s willingness to pursue privatization. In November 2003, the NDP narrowly regained a majority government, winning 30 of 58 seats.

During his full term in office, Calvert expanded child care spaces and introduced a number of targeted welfare programs. The government also began reforming immigration systems to attract more immigrants, and expanded investment in renewable energy and energy conservation. Calvert&#x27;s spending plans were buoyed by a renewed boom in commodity prices, which led to significant increases in resource revenue for the province. Calvert instigated a tax review committee that led to corporate tax cuts, designed to bring the province more in line with its neighbours. Along with tweaks to income taxes and resource royalties, this has been credited with instigating a period of rapid growth in the provincial economy. The NDP cut the provincial sales tax down to five percent, froze tuition, and invested in highway renewal.

Late in the term, Calvert became increasingly antagonistic with the federal government, a minority parliament led by Stephen Harper&#x27;s Conservatives. In March 2007, Calvert argued that the clawback of non-renewable resource revenues from the equalization formula as implemented in the 2007 federal budget would leave Saskatchewan getting significantly less than had been promised. Calvert instructed his government to prepare a lawsuit against the federal government, a tactic that was interrupted by the fall provincial election.

Calvert and his government were defeated in the 2007 provincial election, in which management of the province&#x27;s booming economy and health care became focal points. The NDP&#x27;s central campaign commitment was a universal drug plan capping prescription drug costs at $15. Importantly, unlike Hermanson, new Saskatchewan Party leader Brad Wall made a vocal commitment not to privatize the province&#x27;s crown corporations. The result was a drop to 20 seats for the NDP while Wall&#x27;s party won a majority government. Upon defeat, Calvert expressed pride in a &quot;good run in government&quot; for the NDP. After the election, Calvert—who retained his Saskatoon Riversdale seat—said he had no immediate plans to step down as leader, but conceded that he was unlikely to lead the party into the next election.

=== Retirement ===
Just two weeks after the 2007 election, federal NDP spokesman Brad Lavigne confirmed to reporters that Jack Layton&#x27;s office had asked Calvert to consider standing as a candidate in the 2008 federal election. Calvert declined to run, but stated that he would support the party&#x27;s federal candidates.

Calvert announced on October 16, 2008, that he would be stepping down as party leader, triggering a leadership race. Dwain Lingenfelter, a former cabinet minister in the government&#x27;s of Romanow and Allan Blakeney, was elected the party&#x27;s new leader in a four-person contest on June 6, 2009. At the end of the Spring session in May 2009, Calvert touted the economic progress his government had made, and revealed that he planned to return to the United Church.

==Post-retirement and honours==
From 2009 to 2018, Calvert was the principal at St. Andrew&#x27;s College in Saskatoon. In 2019, St. Andrew&#x27;s awarded Calvert with an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree.

In 2015, Calvert was named to the Saskatchewan Order of Merit.

== Controversies ==
During the 2003 election campaign, Calvert denounced and apologized for an internal cartoon that was leaked to the media, depicting Saskatchewan Party leader Hermanson loading NDP sympathizers onto rail cars—the cartoon referred to speculation that Hermanson wanted to replace civil servants with Saskatchewan Party supporters.

<doc id="270937" wikidata="Q365213" url="?curid=270937" title="Gary Doer">
<text>Gary Albert Doer (born 31 March 1948) is a former Canadian politician and diplomat from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. He served as Canada&#x27;s ambassador to the United States from 19 October 2009, to 3 March 2016. Doer previously served as the 20th premier of Manitoba from 1999 to 2009, leading a New Democratic Party government.

Since the end of his term as envoy to Washington, Doer has taken up a position as senior business advisor with the global law firm Dentons and was retained by the government of Alberta to lobby the Trump administration on the softwood lumber dispute. Doer is a member of the Inter-American Dialogue.

==Early life and career==
Gary Doer was born to a middle class family in Winnipeg, Manitoba. His background is German and Welsh. He graduated from St. Paul&#x27;s High School and went on to study political science and sociology at the University of Manitoba for one year where he was a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, but left to become a corrections officer at the Vaughan Street Detention Centre. He later rose to become deputy superintendent of the Manitoba Youth Centre. Doer&#x27;s work environment was not always safe: he once had to deal with a hostage taking situation, and was attacked with a baseball bat on another occasion.

Doer became president of the Manitoba Government Employees&#x27; Association in 1979, and served in this capacity until 1986. He also held prominent positions with the Manitoba Federation of Labour and the National Union of Public and General Employees, served as a director of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, and became a governor of the University of Manitoba. In 1983, he negotiated an agreement with the provincial government of Howard Pawley in which civil servants agreed to delay a wage increase in return for a guarantee of no layoffs or wage rollbacks. The following year, he openly criticized Dennis McDermott&#x27;s leadership of the Canadian Labour Congress.

Doer first joined the New Democratic Party in the 1970s, and worked for the party in the 1973 provincial election. He discontinued his membership in 1975 to preserve the neutrality of his union, and was later courted by both the New Democrats and Progressive Conservatives to run for public office. He rejoined the NDP in 1986, and was a candidate in that year&#x27;s provincial election.

==Cabinet minister==
Doer was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1986 provincial election for the northeast Winnipeg division of Concordia. He joined the government of Premier Howard Pawley on 17 April 1986, as Minister of Urban Affairs, and was given additional responsibilities as Minister responsible for the Manitoba Telephone System on 2 December of the same year. Doer ordered a Royal Canadian Mounted Police probe of the MTS soon after his appointment, and worked to reform its practices following a failed investment in Saudi Arabia. He soon developed a reputation as a &quot;fixer&quot;, working as a trouble-shooter in difficult fields.

Doer was given further responsibilities as Minister of Crown Investments on 5 February 1987, and was later named as Minister responsible for the Accountability of Crown Corporations (19 August 1987) and Minister responsible for the Liquor Control Act (21 September 1987). Seen as a rising star in the party, he was sometimes mentioned as a future leader.

The Pawley government was sustained by a narrow legislative majority after the 1986 election, and was defeated on 8 March 1988, when disgruntled backbencher Jim Walding voted with the opposition on a budget non-confidence motion. Pawley resigned as NDP leader the next day, and called a new general election for 26 April.

==NDP leader==

===Leadership election===
Doer was the first declared candidate in the Manitoba New Democratic Party&#x27;s 1988 leadership contest. He was supported by cabinet ministers Vic Schroeder, Myrna Phillips, Muriel Smith, Leonard Evans, Jerry Storie and Wilson Parasiuk, and by federal Members of Parliament Rod Murphy and David Orlikow. He also received an endorsement from the Manitoba Federation of Labour. Doer emphasized his experience in managing large organizations, and called for pay equity legislation to be introduced within a year of his election. He narrowly defeated rival candidate Len Harapiak on the third ballot of the party&#x27;s leadership convention in Winnipeg. He was not sworn in as premier, as the legislature had already been dissolved.

Doer became leader of the Manitoba NDP when the party was at a low ebb of popularity. An internal poll before the election showed that they had only 6% popular support, and some NDP workers privately worried that they could lose all of their legislative seats. Many believed Doer was their best hope for a recovery. Support for the NDP increased to 19% during the leadership campaign, and to 23% after Doer was chosen as Pawley&#x27;s successor. The party nevertheless remained in third place, and faced an uphill struggle in the 1988 election.

===1988 election===
Doer promised a $58 million tax cut, and opposed the federal government&#x27;s free trade deal with the United States of America. He indicated that he was open to the possibility of amending the Meech Lake Accord, a federal proposal for constitutional reform. He also promised to build more community health centres, and supported home renovations for senior citizens and the disabled.

The NDP won 12 out of 57 seats, while the Progressive Conservatives under Gary Filmon won 25 seats and the Liberals under Sharon Carstairs jumped from one seat to twenty. Although the NDP was knocked down to third place, it still held the balance of power. Doer rejected the possibility of forming a coalition government with the Liberals. Instead, he opted to tolerate a PC minority government, clearing the way for Filmon to become premier with the Liberals as the Official Opposition. He was not personally blamed for his party&#x27;s loss, and continued as party leader. The NDP chose not to defeat Filmon&#x27;s government during confidence votes in late 1988 and early 1989, as Doer argued the public would not support another election for a legislature less than a year old.

===Meech Lake Accord===
The dominant political issue in Manitoba between 1988 and 1990 was the Meech Lake Accord, which recognized Quebec as a &quot;distinct society&quot; in Canada and devolved some powers from the federal government to the provinces. The accord required approval from all ten provincial legislatures to become law. The provincial Liberals initially opposed the accord, which meant that Doer&#x27;s support was necessary for its passage. In November 1988, Doer indicated that his party would not support the accord unless certain amendments were introduced. He was later appointed to a provincial panel that held a series of public meetings, and recommended significant changes to the deal. The Filmon government also expressed skepticism about the accord, and announced that it too would seek amendments from the federal government.

All three Manitoba party leaders agreed to a federally brokered compromise in June 1990, shortly before the accord&#x27;s official deadline. The accord nonetheless failed to pass in the Manitoba legislature because of a procedural motion from Elijah Harper, a Cree member of the NDP caucus who argued that it did not give fair representation to Indigenous Canadians. Doer described Harper&#x27;s decision as &quot;a fundamental issue of conscience&quot;, and blamed Prime Minister Brian Mulroney for delaying negotiations until the deadline had almost expired. One year later, he indicated that he felt &quot;betrayed&quot; by federal negotiators, and described the entire Meech Lake process as &quot;dishonest from start to finish&quot;.

===1990 election===
In the aftermath of the accord&#x27;s defeat, Filmon called a provincial election for 11 September 1990. Doer promised a ten-year freeze on personal income taxes, and argued that the Progressive Conservatives would pursue a hidden right-wing agenda if they won a majority government. He also promised legislation that would make it more difficult for companies based in Manitoba to close down.

An early poll showed the NDP in third place with 18% support, well behind the governing Progressive Conservatives and also behind the Liberals. The Liberal campaign faltered, however, and the New Democrats were able to make strong gains in the election&#x27;s final days, partly buoyed by the unexpected victory of Bob Rae&#x27;s New Democrats in the neighbouring province of Ontario. The Progressive Conservatives won a narrow majority with 30 seats, while the New Democrats won 20 and the Liberals seven. Doer succeeded Carstairs as Leader of the Opposition in the legislature.

==Leader of the Opposition==

===First term, 1990–95===
Doer criticized the Filmon government&#x27;s cutbacks to health and education, and drew attention to the province&#x27;s rising unemployment and child poverty rates in the early 1990s. Opposing Filmon&#x27;s austerity measures, he argued it was inappropriate for the government to cut jobs at a time of high unemployment. In 1993, he opposed the government&#x27;s decision to end funding for groups such as the Foster Family Association, the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, the Manitoba Anti-Poverty Organization and the Manitoba Environmental Council.

Doer announced in late 1992 that his caucus would support the Charlottetown Accord, a comprehensive package on constitutional reform that was introduced by the federal government after the failure of Meech Lake. The Accord was defeated in a national referendum.

Doer released an election platform in November 1994, highlighted by a ten-point preventive health-care program for children and a six-point Manitoba Works plan to reduce unemployment.

===1995 election===
Doer focused on health issues in the 1995 provincial election. He promised that he would replace walk-in clinics with neighbourhood health organizations, to be staffed with salaried doctors, nurses, midwives and social workers. He pledged to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to reduce prescription drug costs, and to review some of the hundreds of drugs that had been delisted in recent years. He also promised to create a new group of health providers called nurse practitioners, to carry out some doctors&#x27; responsibilities. On economic issues, Doer promised a balanced budget with no personal or sales tax increases over four years and indicated that he would cut nearly $119 million from government programs to fund health, education, and job creation.

An early poll from the Angus Reid firm showed the Progressive Conservatives with 37% support, the Liberals with 35%, and the NDP with 21%. The Liberal campaign faltered once again, however, and a poll released only days before the election showed the NDP had again surpassed the Liberals for second place. The Progressive Conservatives were re-elected with 31 seats, the NDP increased their total to 23, and the Liberals fell to only three. By the time of the election, the Ontario NDP was deeply unpopular, and Filmon&#x27;s Tories capitalized on fears that Doer would govern in a similar manner to Rae if elected.

In the closing days of the campaign, Doer asked the province&#x27;s chief electoral officer to investigate reports that three independent candidates from an unregistered party known as Native Voice had received assistance from a Progressive Conservative campaign official. Some believed these candidates would split the progressive-left vote in their ridings, and give the Progressive Conservatives a greater chance of winning. Little was done at the time, but the story emerged as a prominent provincial scandal following an exposé from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in June 1998. Doer called for an inquiry, which the Filmon government granted; the presiding officer determined that at least one of the candidates had been illegally induced to run to by local agents of the Progressive Conservative Party.

===Second term, 1995–99===
Despite an improving economy, the Filmon government&#x27;s 1996 budget introduced further cuts to social assistance, health care, and post-secondary and public school education. Doer argued that the cuts were ideological in nature, and not based on financial necessity. The government also introduced legislation permitting unionized workers to shield their dues from being donated to political parties. Doer suggested that corporate shareholders should also be allowed to opt out of party donations.

Doer opposed the Filmon government&#x27;s decision to privatize the Manitoba Telephone System in 1996, arguing that it would cause Manitobans to lose control over a vital part of their economy. He called for a referendum, which Filmon rejected. Doer nonetheless accepted the finality of the sale, telling party delegates in 1999 that buying back the service would be too expensive and carry too many risks.

Doer also opposed the Filmon government&#x27;s proposal to water-down the single-desk marketing powers of the Canadian Wheat Board. He argued there could be no &quot;middle-of-the-road&quot; position on the Wheat Board, adding that continued single-desk marketing would be &quot;in the economic interests of producers and the economic interests of Winnipeg&quot;.

Some New Democrats expressed discontent with Doer&#x27;s leadership in late 1997. Most notably, a group led by policy committee chairman Victor Olson issued a statement on party renewal that was generally interpreted as a challenge to his leadership. This came to nothing, but there was general agreement among party members that Doer would need to win the next election to continue as party leader.

===1999 election===
In the buildup to the 1999 provincial election, Doer unveiled a platform that called for balanced budgets, debt repayment and a freeze on taxes. He again emphasized health care as a priority, and said that his government would stop the practice of using public monies for politically motivated polls and advertisements. He also expressed concern that the Progressive Conservatives could privatize Manitoba Hydro, and criticized a provincial workfare initiative as giving too much discretionary power to government overseers.

The NDP voted to support the Filmon government&#x27;s 1999 budget, citing the premier&#x27;s decision to increase health spending with money from a provincial &quot;rainy day fund&quot;. Doer added that, if elected, his party would replace Filmon&#x27;s budgeted income tax cut with a property tax cut.

The NDP entered the 1999 election in a much stronger position than in the three previous campaigns. A poll taken three years earlier had shown the NDP leading the Progressive Conservatives for the first time since the Pawley administration. The Tories regained their lead by 1998, but fallout from the vote-splitting scandal gave the NDP an 8% lead in a Probe/Free Press poll issued in March 1999. In this period, many began to regard the NDP as a possible government-in-waiting. Later polls showed the gap between the parties narrowing to a virtual tie.

Doer pledged $13 million to shorten health-care waiting times in the 1999 campaign, and promised if he was elected he would end hallway in six months. He also pledged an additional $2 million to hire more nurses and provide incentives for rural doctors. In education, he promised to cut college and university tuition fees by 10% and to invest $24 million to the province&#x27;s three community colleges. On election reform, he promised to ban campaign donations from corporations and unions. Doer also criticized the Filmon government&#x27;s handling of a contract with Urban Shared Services Corp., which attempted to save the province money by reheating food for hospitals and seniors&#x27; homes at a centralized location. The project went well over-budget, and the food was often criticized as inedible.

A poll released a week before the election showed the NDP and Progressive Conservatives tied with 42% support, and the election was considered too close to call until the actual day of voting. The NDP ultimately won 32 seats, against 24 for the Progressive Conservatives and only one for the Liberals. A collapse of the Liberal vote worked to the NDP&#x27;s advantage.

==Premier==
More than eleven years after declining the option, Doer was sworn in as Premier of Manitoba on 5 October 1999. He also took the position of Minister of Federal/Provincial Relations.

===Re-election campaigns===
After governing for just under four years, Doer called a new provincial election for June 2003. He brought forward a five point re-election plan highlighted by promises to reduce property and income taxes, hire more nurses and doctors and make reductions in medical waiting lists, take a cautious approach to managing the economy, and improve the province&#x27;s education and law enforcement systems. Many journalists noted similarities to the NDP&#x27;s 1999 platform. The NDP held a massive lead in the polls throughout the campaign, and most observers agreed that its re-election was a foregone conclusion. Even the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot;, not traditionally supportive of the NDP, urged voters to re-elect Doer&#x27;s government. The NDP won an increased majority with 49.47% support and 35 of 57 seats, and made inroads into traditionally Progressive Conservative areas of south Winnipeg.

Four years later, Doer called an election for May 2007. The NDP campaign focused on Doer&#x27;s personal popularity and his government&#x27;s record in office. The party released a seven-point re-election plan, focused on health care, the environment, education, tax cuts, public safety, money for highways, and keeping Manitoba Hydro as a public institution. Doer promised to hire 700 nurses and nurse practitioners, 100 new police officers, 20 new crown prosecutors, and 20 new workplace safety inspectors. He also promised to improve Manitoba&#x27;s record on vehicle emissions, provide tax credits for caregivers, and phase out the provincial small business tax over three years. The NDP was again re-elected with an increased majority, this time taking 36 of 57 seats.

===Prominent cabinet members===
Prominent members of Doer&#x27;s first cabinet included Greg Selinger in Finance, Gord Mackintosh in Justice, David Chomiak in Health and Rosann Wowchuk in Agriculture. Tim Sale replaced Chomiak at Health in October 2004, and was in turn succeeded by Theresa Oswald in 2006. Chomiak replaced Mackintosh at Justice in 2006. Selinger remained as Finance Minister until 2009, when he succeeded Doer as Premier. Wowchuk remains in Agriculture.

Jean Friesen served as Doer&#x27;s Deputy Premier in his first term. She retired in 2003, and Doer chose Rosann Wowchuk as her replacement.

===Financial policy===
The Doer government has introduced an uninterrupted succession of balanced budgets since its first election in 1999. These budgets have generally been cautious, and have sought to balance tax concerns with spending increases. Doer&#x27;s first budget, delivered in 2000, removed 15,000 low-income Manitobans from the tax rolls and introduced $150 million in tax breaks over three years while projecting a $10 million surplus. His 2003 budget, the last of his first term, reduced provincial taxes by $82.7 million and increased spending by about 5%, mostly in health and education.

Despite a series of economic setbacks, the government was able to post a balanced budget in 2004 through increased taxes and drug premiums as well as civil service reduction through attrition. Tobacco and liquor taxes were increased and the provincial sales tax expanded to cover more services, although Doer rejected a panel recommendation to increase the sales tax by 1%.

The government was able introduce a more expansive budget in 2005 after an infusion of federal revenues, reducing personal and property taxes, increasing spending by 3.5%, and putting $314 million into a &quot;rainy day&quot; fund. Doer&#x27;s 2006 and 2007 budgets introduced further tax cuts, and the 2007 budget offered increased education spending and a new child benefit to assist low-income families.

At the Manitoba NDP&#x27;s March 2009 convention, Doer announced that Manitoba would continue its commitment to education, training and research despite a global economic downturn and a slowing economy. He argued that the province was still recovering from the Filmon government&#x27;s spending cuts during the economic downtown of the 1990s, and that his policies would allow Manitoba to emerge from the recession in a strong, competitive position. His government introduced a balanced budget with economic stimulus programs a few weeks later, even as the global recession forced other provincial governments across Canada into deficit.

Doer encouraged the Bank of Canada to lower its rates in late 2003, saying that the rising strength of the Canadian dollar in relation to the United States dollar was causing increased unemployment. He later criticized Bank Governor David Dodge for doing nothing to save Canadian jobs and profits. In early 2008, he called for a national strategy to offset the disruptions caused by Canada&#x27;s soaring dollar.

In 2004, provincial Auditor General Jon Singleton argued that Manitoba was actually running a deficit due to costs associated with crown corporations, utilities and arm&#x27;s-length agencies that were not officially counted in the budget. He recommended that Manitoba adopt a system of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Greg Selinger, Doer&#x27;s Finance Minister, noted that the existing rules were set in place by the Filmon government, and indicated that the NDP had included a summary financial statement to its budget including many of the costs Singleton identified. The Doer government nevertheless announced in 2005 that it would adopt GAAP.

For the first seven years of his administration, Doer was assisted on financial matters by Eugene Kostyra, a cabinet minister from the Pawley government. Kostyra resigned from his position as secretary of Manitoba&#x27;s Community and Economic Development Committee in late 2006, and Angela Mathieson was appointed as his replacement.

===Health===
Doer has frequently argued in favour of Canada&#x27;s public health system. He criticized Alberta&#x27;s plan to introduce more private health provisions in 2002, and defended the public system as efficient and less expensive. In the same year, he endorsed Roy Romanow&#x27;s assessment that the federal government must play a stronger role in health care to prevent more encroachments by the private system. At a presentation before the Romanow Commission in 2002, Doer called for the federal government to double its health care commitment. Two years later, he played a significant role in negotiations that saw the federal government contribute $18 billion in new funding to the provinces over six years.

The Doer government&#x27;s first budget included a $135 million increase in health spending, taking total provincial spending to $2.43 billion. In October 2002, the government announced a long-anticipated $100 million expansion to the Health Sciences Centre in Winnipeg, with new operating rooms and emergency departments. The government was unable to end &quot;hallway medicine&quot; in the six-month period it had promised during the 1999 election, and faced the problem of nursing vacancies in the early 2000s. Nevertheless, most observers agreed that the provincial situation improved significantly between 1999 and 2003. Health spending continued to increase during Doer&#x27;s second term; a report in December 2004 indicated that Manitoba&#x27;s per capita health spending was the highest in Canada for the seventh continuous year.

Doer emerged as a defender of Manitoba&#x27;s burgeoning internet pharmaceutical industry in the mid-2000s. This industry was very popular among American clients, but nonetheless provoked opposition within both countries. In 2004, Doer accused federal Health Minister Ujjal Dosanjh of capitulating to American interests by agreeing to increased restrictions on the industry. He later argued that the Canadian government could protect its national drug supply and maintain Manitoba&#x27;s pharmaceutical sector simply by banning bulk exports.

Doer&#x27;s government introduced a landmark anti-smoking bill in 2004, banning smoking in all indoor public places and workplaces across the province. Supported by all parties, the legislation was the first of its kind in Canada. It did not cover Manitobans working in federal government buildings or living on First Nations territory, as these were not under provincial jurisdiction.

Doer welcomed Prime Minister Paul Martin&#x27;s decision to name Winnipeg as the site of Canada&#x27;s new public health agency in 2004.

===Social policy===
The Doer government passed a bill granting full adoption rights to gay and lesbian couples in 2002. The NDP and Liberals supported the bill, while the Progressive Conservatives voted against it.

In 2004, the federal government announced that it would introduce legislation to permit the legalization of same-sex marriage in Canada. Federal Justice Minister Irwin Cotler initially indicated that civic officials would be allowed to opt out of performing same-sex marriages if the practice offended their beliefs. Doer criticized this, arguing that provincial employees should not be permitted to discriminate. Doer initially declined to express his personal views on the subject, but announced in late 2004 that he supported same-sex marriage as a human right.

In April 2005, Doer signed a $176 million deal with the federal government of Paul Martin to expand the provincial day-care sector. The project was canceled in 2006 by the new Conservative government of Stephen Harper, over Doer&#x27;s objections.

Unlike some within the NDP, Doer is personally opposed to the decriminalization of marijuana, which he has said could result in economic difficulties with the United States.

As premier, Doer encouraged several Manitoba crown corporations to donate money to the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg; Manitoba Public Insurance, Manitoba Hydro, Manitoba Lotteries Corporation and the Manitoba Liquor Control Commission subsequently made donations of one million dollars each. Opposition leader Hugh McFadyen and some journalists questioned Doer&#x27;s involvement in the matter, arguing that he was effectively directing the corporations to make these donations.

===Education===
Doer&#x27;s government cut university tuition by 10% during its first term, and later provided universities with a property tax exemption. It also amalgamated several school divisions prior to the 2002 municipal elections, and began to phase out education property taxes in the same period.

In 2006, the Doer government introduced a proposal for Manitoba university graduates to receive a tuition rebate of up to 60% if they chose to stay and work in the province after graduation.

A 2008 &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; article indicated that Manitoba and Alberta were investing more money in public education per student than all other provinces of Canada. Teachers&#x27; wages in Manitoba were also noted to be healthy in relation to the average national wage.

===Agriculture===
Shortly after being sworn in as premier, Doer led an all-party delegation to Ottawa to seek a $1.3 billion financial bailout for western farmers to help mitigate an economic downturn in the sector. He was joined by Saskatchewan Premier Roy Romanow, Progressive Conservative MLA Larry Maguire, and Manitoba Liberal leader Jon Gerrard. The federal government introduced $170 million in funding shortly thereafter, a figure that Doer and Romanow described as &quot;heartless&quot;. In February 2000, Romanow and Doer stood with Chrétien to announce their support for a compromise bailout of $400 million.

Shortly after his re-election in 2003, Doer criticized the federal government for failing to respond to an agriculture crisis caused by the discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in a Canadian cow and the subsequent closure of the American border to beef products produced in Canada. The federal and provincial governments subsequently agreed on a $50 million bailout to the industry. The border was reopened to live cattle in December 2004.

Doer strongly supports the Canadian Wheat Board&#x27;s policy of single-desk marketing, and has opposed efforts by some on the political right to weaken its status. In late 2006, Doer accused federal Agriculture Minister Chuck Strahl of interfering in the Wheat Board&#x27;s elections.

The Doer government has rejected a return to single-desk hog marketing, which was eliminated during the years of the Filmon government. During its second term, the government supported plans to establish an OlyWest hog processing plant in northeast Winnipeg. This measure was extremely controversial among party members, and area NDP MLAs Daryl Reid and Bidhu Jha indicated that they opposed the measure. In response to criticism, Doer withdrew his support for OlyWest in 2007. The Doer government introduced a temporary ban on new hog farms throughout most of the province in March 2008, following the release of a provincial environmental report. Around the same time, Doer announced new funding for waste-water treatment plants that would allow two existing hog-processing plants to expand their operations.

Doer is a vocal opponent of the American Country of Origin Labelling initiative, which would require American producers to separate meat from hogs slaughtered in Canada and increase packing and labelling cost.

===Justice===
Doer opposed the Chrétien government&#x27;s decision to implement a federal gun registry, and his government joined with other provinces to raise a constitutional challenge against the law in 2000.

Doer called for the federal government to strengthen its laws against child pornography in 2002, after the Supreme Court of British Columbia ruled that John Robin Sharpe&#x27;s fictional writings involving children met the legal definition of &quot;artistic merit&quot;. Doer was quoted as saying, &quot;We believe that the rights of children should be superior rights in our country to the rights of perverts&quot;. The following year, the Manitoba government unveiled a website that included photographs and profiles of high-risk sex offenders.

Also in 2002, Doer argued that persons who kill police officers should spend the rest of their natural lives in jail, without access to Canada&#x27;s so-called &quot;Faint Hope Clause&quot; for early release. Three years later, he argued that the provisions of the federal &quot;Youth Criminal Justice Act&quot; were too lenient. In 2007, Doer led an all-party task force to Ottawa to seek greater federal penalties for gang-related crime, youth offences and car theft.

In 2004, the Doer government increased funding for the hiring of police officers and Crown prosecutors. Following increased urban violence in 2005, the province announced funding for 54 more officers. The government also launched an initiative to hire seven recreational directors for inner-city Winnipeg neighbourhoods in 2008, to provide sports opportunities for youth as an alternative to crime.

Doer announced the creation of an all-party task force on security following the attacks of 11 September 2001. The following month, he announced that he would work with the Governors of Minnesota and North Dakota for a coordinated security strategy.

Doer&#x27;s government tabled legislation in 2009 to provide civilian oversight of police officers in Manitoba, following an inquiry into the death of Crystal Taman. She was killed when her car, stopped for a red light, was struck by off-duty Winnipeg Police constable Derek Harvey-Zink&#x27;s pickup truck. The Taman Inquiry&#x27;s report strongly criticized the resulting police investigation into the collision, as well as the Doer Government&#x27;s choice of special prosecutor, Marty Minuk.

===Environment===
Doer has been a strong and consistent supporter of the Kyoto Accord on climate change. In February 2004, his government signed an agreement with the Chicago Climate Exchange pledging Manitoba to create a trust fund to pay for projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 2007, he announced that Manitoba would pursue a plan with other provinces and states to push greenhouse gas emissions to 15% below 2005 levels by 2020. The next year, Doer legislated his province&#x27;s commitment to meet its targets under the Kyoto Protocol by 2012.

Doer announced that Manitoba would increase ethanol production in 2002, and held consultations on a plan requiring Manitoba drivers to use ethanol-blended gasoline. In October 2002, the government instructed its provincial fleet drivers to switch to ethanol fuels. These plans stalled due to limited production, but were revived when a new facility was constructed in late 2005.

In March 2004, the government introduced enabling legislation on water protection, allowing for the introduction of specific regulations on water protection zones, water quality standards, and related matters.

Doer signed the Midwestern Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord with seven American governors in November 2007. The following month, he announced that Manitoba would introduce vehicle emission standards similar to those in California. In late January 2008, he agreed to a blueprint proposal with the premiers of British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec for a market-based trading system to cut greenhouse gas emissions. He later became an enthusiastic supporter of North American cap and trade programs to reduce energy emissions, while at the same time criticizing the idea of a carbon tax.

Doer introduced plans to eliminate coal-burning factories in his 2008 budget. The budget also included a new program for water conservation, and a $7 million fund directed toward climate change issues. He also called for an independent review of the Manitoba Clean Environment Commission in 2008, arguing that the renewal process for hydroelectric projects was too long.

In November 2008, Doer announced that his government would ban new logging in provincial parks and phase out existing projects. He also announced a ban on plastic shopping bags, and on the use of cellphones while driving. Parents were also forbidden to smoke when children were in the car. The opposition Progressive Conservatives indicated that it would support all of these initiatives.

In late 2005, the American magazine &quot;Business Week&quot; listed Doer as one of the top twenty international leaders fighting climate change.

===Aboriginal issues===
In November 1999, Doer appointed a two-person panel to advise his government on implementing the findings of the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry, which had been published eight years earlier. In April 2000, Manitoba took steps to provide indigenous Manitobans with their own child and family-service agencies. Doer convened a provincial summit on aboriginal commerce in November 2004. He indicated that the summit was intended to showcase successful businesses, and to forge greater links between the aboriginal and non-aboriginal communities.

Doer is a strong supporter of the Kelowna Accord signed in late 2005 by the federal government of Paul Martin, provincial premiers and aboriginal leaders. After the Martin government was defeated in the 2006 federal election and replaced by the government of Stephen Harper, Doer criticized Harper&#x27;s failure to implement the accord.

In late 2008, the Doer government introduced legislation to give sixteen bands on the east shore of Lake Winnipeg greater authority over the management of their traditional lands. The bill requires that plans for development be approved by both the province and the band&#x27;s chief, and extends the range of influence well beyond the area&#x27;s small reserves. Some chiefs in the affected area later objected to the bill on procedural grounds, arguing that they were not properly consulted.

Following consultations with the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs in 1999, the Doer government established a selection committee to oversee proposals for setting up casinos in Manitoba first nations. The process subsequently became stalled, and only one of the casinos was up and running by 2003. The government subsequently appointed a panel to review the situation and recommend a change in strategy; the panel argued that the province should consider creating one large casino, instead of several small on-reserve casinos. A second casino was opened in 2005, while the larger issue remained unresolved as of 2007.

===Energy===
Doer has often referred to hydroelectric power as playing a major role in Manitoba&#x27;s long-term economic strategy, and has advocated a national east-west power grid to export Manitoba&#x27;s plentiful hydroelectric power to Ontario and other provinces in Western Canada.

Doer announced Manitoba&#x27;s first wind farm project in November 2004, near the community of St. Leon. This was a private-public partnership arranged between Manitoba Hydro and AirSource Power Fund. It was officially started in April 2005.

In September 2007, Manitoba Hydro indicated that it would construct a new transmission line to connect north and south Manitoba on the west side of Lake Winnipeg. Hydro&#x27;s initial plan had been to construct the line on the east side, but Doer&#x27;s government rejected this approach, arguing that it would damage pristine boreal forest territories. The local aboriginal community is divided on the issue, with some leaders supporting the government&#x27;s conservation approach and others arguing that east side construction would help combat poverty in the area. The Progressive Conservative Party has strongly criticized Doer&#x27;s decision. In April 2008, Manitoba Hydro announced a $2 billion agreement to sell surplus energy to Wisconsin once the construction is complete.

Doer asked Manitoba Hydro and the Manitoba Public Utilities Board to provide an analysis of natural gas prices in July 2008, with the intent of limiting price increases during the winter. He also indicated that his government would intervene to protect consumers from high prices. Finance Minister Greg Selinger later indicated that the government would provide some relief for consumers, but would not use Manitoba Hydro&#x27;s profits to offset rate increases.

===Labour issues===
The Doer government introduced a number of labour reforms early in its first mandate, making it easier for unions to obtain certification and giving employees increased powers to move disputes to binding arbitration. Business leaders opposed the changes, though Doer argued that the bill was far less contentious than opponents made it out to be. In 2004, Doer rejected a call by party members to introduce legislation that would ban replacement workers in labour disputes.

Doer&#x27;s government increased Manitoba&#x27;s minimum wage from $6.00 to $6.25 in November 2000, and brought in subsequent increases of 25 cents on an annual basis. By April 2005, the minimum wage had been increased to $7.25. Some argued that this was still short of a living wage. The minimum wage was increased to $8.50 in 2008. In 2005, the Doer government introduced a bill to expand provincial workers&#x27; compensation coverage.

The Doer government announced in late 2007 that temporary foreign workers and modeling agencies would be included under the &quot;Employment Standards Act&quot;, to prevent worker exploitation.

===Science and infrastructure===

===Monsanto===
In 1999, the Manitoba government under NDP leadership, began its ongoing relationship with Monsanto, accepting a 12.5 million dollar agreement to bring in its first development centre. In 2005, Gary Doer announced a deal to allow Monsanto to build their 42,000 square foot Canadian head office in Manitoba.

Doer&#x27;s government introduced a biotechnology training strategy in October 2002, to address a skilled-worker shortage in the industry.
In early 2003, Doer signed a $160 million deal with the federal government for expansion work on the Red River Floodway. The floodway expansion was described as the largest infrastructure project in Manitoba history, and was started in late 2005.

Doer took part in discussions in 2007-08 with media mogul David Asper and officials from other levels of government, regarding the location of a new stadium for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers football team. He was skeptical about Asper&#x27;s initial plan for a stadium in the Polo Park region of Winnipeg, and was more supportive of an abortive plan to construct the stadium in the economically depressed area of Point Douglas. Asper eventually chose site in Fort Garry, next to the University of Manitoba. The deal was finalized in early 2009, with the province providing $20 million in funding; provincial officials believe that all but $1 million will be recovered before the stadium opens in 2011.

In September 2008, Doer and Winnipeg Mayor Sam Katz announced $138 million for a rapid transit plan that will eventually link downtown Winnipeg with the University of Manitoba. In the same month, Doer designated a piece of land in northwest Winnipeg as the site of a future inland port. The area was given the name CentrePort Canada, and its first directors were chosen in December 2008.

Doer announced in February 2009 that his government would spend $1 million on special training for northern Manitoba workers, following a global economic downtown that adversely affected the province&#x27;s forestry and mining sectors. Two months later, he joined with the federal government to announce a $40 million investment in a cold weather aerospace engine testing and research facility in Thompson. In early May 2009, the federal and provincial governments announced $116 million for infrastructure renewal in rural and northern communities.

===Crocus Investment Fund===
In early 2005, the labour-managed Crocus Investment Fund stopped trading and entered into financial protection. The Doer government was subsequently accused of having ignored signs of trouble at the fund, and of failing to protect the interests of investors. The opposition Progressive Conservatives argued that the government had neglected warnings of financial impropriety, in part because of ideological links between the New Democratic Party and the labour movement. Doer rejected this charge, observing that the fund had been established by the Filmon government in conjunction with labour leaders. He also rejected calls from the opposition for a formal inquiry, and insisted that the province did nothing wrong in the matter.

===Federal-provincial relations===
Doer supported the Chrétien government&#x27;s &quot;Clarity Act&quot; legislation, which required that any future negotiations on provincial secession be preceded by a referendum with a clearly defined question. The act was opposed by Quebec nationalists, who regarded it as an infringement on their national sovereignty. In 2004, Doer criticized new Prime Minister Paul Martin for seeming to undermine the principles of the bill. He also criticized Martin&#x27;s promise to remove the &quot;Notwithstanding Clause&quot; from the Constitution of Canada in the 2006 federal election. Doer later criticized Martin&#x27;s successor, Stephen Harper, for recognizing the Québécois as a nation within Canada in late 2006. He was quoted as saying, &quot;[t]o me, Canada is one nation, one country. I understand Quebec is unique in terms of language, culture and law, but Canada is one country.&quot;

Notwithstanding this and other criticisms, a May 2008 article in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; newspaper described Doer as one of the few premiers to have a good working relationship with Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Manitoba signed on to the federal government&#x27;s Building Canada Fund in late 2008, receiving about $500 million in new infrastructure monies. Following a global economic downturn in late 2008, Doer called on the federal government to invest in job creation and infrastructure funding. Prime Minister Harper later said that his government would spend more on roads, bridges and other public works.

According to journalist Chantal Hébert, Doer played a vital role in convincing other provincial leaders to accept Quebec Premier Jean Charest&#x27;s plan to create the Council of the Federation in 2003. In 2008-09, Charest and Doer helped broker an agreement among the premiers to provide for greater labour mobility within Canada.

In early 2007, Doer said that Manitoba would not enter a free trade deal signed between Alberta and British Columbia. He instead called for a national trade accord. Doer met with other western Canadian premiers in June 2009 to introduce a plan for the collective purchase of prescription drugs. The premiers indicated that the plan could save taxpayers millions of dollars.

In late 2008, the federal Liberal and New Democratic parties announced plans to defeat the Conservatives on a motion of no confidence and create a coalition government. The plan was ultimately unsuccessful, and the Conservatives remained in power. Doer did not take a position on the coalition, and instead called for all parties in the House of Commons of Canada to work in a cooperative manner.

===International relations===
Since his first election in 1999, Doer has been a leading opponent of a water diversion in Devils Lake, North Dakota that many regard as posing a serious environmental threat to Manitoba. In 2005, the Canadian and American governments reached a non-binding compromise deal on the project that committed both sides to design an advanced filter to prevent environmental disruption. Doer initially described this agreement as a significant improvement over prior arrangements, but later criticized the North Dakota government for starting the water diversion before the deal was finalized. In May 2009, Doer said that Manitoba would invest more than $10 million in drainage improvements if North Dakota would agree to construct a permanent filter on its Devils Lake output. North Dakota Governor John Hoeven rejected the deal in the same month, arguing that the issues were separate.

Doer has led several international trade delegations from Manitoba, including visits to Russia, Germany, Israel, India, China and The Philippines. He also made an historic visit to Iceland in August 2001; Manitoba has a large Icelandic population, and Doer was the first Manitoba Premier to make an official visit to the country. Halldór Ásgrímsson, the Prime Minister of Iceland, made a follow-up visit to Manitoba in July 2005. In May 2008, Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko made an official visit to Manitoba and addressed the provincial legislature.

Doer signed an agreement with the American state of Georgia in 2004, for increased co-operation between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and the National Virology Lab in Winnipeg. In the same year, he signed a memorandum of understanding with Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty to create a &quot;biomedical corridor&quot; for the promotion of research, capital investment and technology development. In early 2005, Doer and New Brunswick Premier Bernard Lord traveled on a trade mission to Texas in what was described as an effort to improve relations between Canada and the United States. Later in the year, Doer and Jean Charest traveled on a trade mission to Mexico. In 2006, he appeared at a prominent climate change event with California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. In June 2009, Doer took part in discussions to create a &quot;Western Energy Corridor&quot; to allow an easier flow of both renewable energy and fossil fuels among western American states and Canadian provinces.

Doer has supported Canada&#x27;s military mission in Afghanistan, despite skepticism about the purpose of the mission from the federal NDP. He called for Canada to ban donations to Hezbollah&#x27;s charity wing in 2002, and endorsed Jean Chrétien government&#x27;s decision to remain out of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.

In 2005, Doer spoke against the American government&#x27;s plans to require passports at Canada–US border crossings. He argued that the new expense of travel would create a &quot;financial Berlin Wall&quot; for some families, and instead proposed a security protocol centred around drivers&#x27; licenses. In 2007, North Dakota Governor John Hoeven announced that he was working with Doer to find an alternative approach.

In 2008, Doer argued that Canada should &quot;aggressively&quot; defend the North American Free Trade Agreement against criticism from American Democratic Party presidential candidates. He later spoke against the United States Congress&#x27;s planned &quot;Buy American&quot; legislation during a business trip to Illinois and Texas.

Doer signed an agreement in Manila in February 2008, to permit an easier flow of immigration from The Philippines to Manitoba.

===Legislative reform===
Doer&#x27;s government changed the rules of the legislature in 1999, to allow the Speaker of the Assembly to be elected by a secret ballot vote of all members. Speakers had previously been appointed by the premier.

The Doer government announced election spending reforms in June 2000, which were highlighted by a ban on political donations by private corporations and organized labour. This measure was opposed by the opposition Progressive Conservatives, and by the right-wing Canadian Taxpayers Federation. The reforms came into effect in 2001, and were extended to party leadership contests in June 2002. Further restrictions were added in 2006. In June 2009, Winnipeg Mayor Sam Katz spoke against Doer&#x27;s plan to ban union and corporate donations from municipal elections.

The Doer government introduced legislation in April 2006 to prevent MLAs from crossing the floor from one party to another. Under the terms of this legislation, MLAs who choose to leave their political party are required to sit as independents until the next election, or to resign and seek re-election for another party.

Doer announced plans in early 2008 to create a lobbyist registry for Manitoba, as well as introducing fixed election dates, partial public campaign financing, and restrictions on partisan direct mail flyers sent out by MLAs at public expense. The plan for public campaign financing was later abandoned after public opposition.

In 2009, opposition politicians and some journalists pressured Doer to call a public inquiry into a controversy involving expense claims from the 1999 provincial election. Elections Manitoba had determined that some reimbursement claims filed by the Manitoba NDP were unwarranted; in late 2003, the party agreed to repay $76,000 in an out-of-court settlement. Critics have charged a lack of transparency in the process, and have questioned why Elections Manitoba did not lay charges. At least one Winnipeg journalist has compared the matter with an expenses scandal faced by the Conservative Party of Canada following the 2006 federal election. Doer has argued that the matter is settled, and that there is no need for an inquiry.

===Popularity===
Doer&#x27;s government enjoyed an extended honeymoon with voters after the 1999 election. The NDP consistently led all other parties in public opinion polls from 1999 until 2005, often by wide margins. The party&#x27;s popularity dipped in late 2005, damaged somewhat by questions resulting from the failure of the Crocus Investment Fund. Polls taken in December 2005 and March 2006 showed the NDP and Progressive Conservatives tied for support. In July 2006, the PCs pulled ahead of the NDP for the first time in seven years. The NDP nevertheless recovered to win a convincing majority in the 2007 election, and in July 2008 held a ten-point lead over the Progressive Conservatives in popular support. The PCs posted a surprise lead over the NDP in a December 2008 poll, although some local journalists questioned its accuracy. By April 2009, the NDP once again held a ten-point lead.

Doer was rated as Canada&#x27;s most popular premier in polls taken in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006, scoring a 77% rating in March 2006. His approval rating was 81% in March 2008, making him the second most popular Canadian premier after Danny Williams of Newfoundland and Labrador.

===Retirement===

On 27 August 2009, Doer announced he would not seek re-election in the 2011 election, and on 28 August 2009, he was nominated by Prime Minister Stephen Harper to succeed Michael Wilson as Canadian ambassador to the United States. He was formally sworn into that position on 19 October 2009, and on the same day Greg Selinger was sworn in as his replacement as Premier of Manitoba. Doer&#x27;s former constituency assistant Matt Wiebe subsequently won the by-election to succeed Doer as MLA for Concordia on 2 March 2010.

==Federal politics==
Doer supported a bid to draft former Manitoba Premier Edward Schreyer as a candidate in the federal New Democratic Party&#x27;s 1989 leadership contest. When Schreyer declined to run, Doer tried to convince Stephen Lewis and then Bob Rae to enter the contest, without success. He eventually supported Audrey McLaughlin, who was elected on the fourth ballot of the party&#x27;s leadership convention.

There was speculation that Doer would seek the federal NDP leadership in 1995, after McLaughlin announced her resignation. He declined, and instead gave his support to longtime friend Alexa McDonough, whom he nominated at the leadership convention. McDonough was chosen as party leader following the first ballot.

Doer opposed the New Politics Initiative in 2001. In the 2003 leadership election, he supported the leadership campaign of Bill Blaikie, whose federal Winnipeg—Transcona riding overlapped with his own provincial division. Blaikie finished second against Jack Layton.

Doer has disagreed with the federal NDP on some issues. He defended CanWest Global&#x27;s takeover of a part of Conrad Black&#x27;s newspaper empire in 2000, even though the arrangement had been criticized by the federal party. He later called for Svend Robinson to be demoted as Foreign Affairs Critic in 2002, after Robinson announced his support for the Palestinians in their conflict with Israel (official NDP policy was that both sides should seek a peace agreement). Doer was quoted as saying, &quot;Either he represents the party as a foreign affairs critic or he&#x27;s removed as foreign affairs critic. And I believe he should be removed&quot;. He later expressed disappointment that Robinson was allowed to keep his critic&#x27;s role, albeit with a ban against speaking on Middle East issues.

Doer published a ten-point proposal for the future of the federal NDP in June 2002, calling for a focus on health and education as well as fiscal balance, community safety and election finance reform.

Doer was considered a possible candidate for the 2012 leadership election, but declined to run.

==Ideology==
Doer is at the centre of the New Democratic Party. He once described his political ideology as follows:

Doer endorsed Tony Blair&#x27;s approach to leading the British Labour Party in 1997, and his own 1999 election platform was frequently compared with Blair&#x27;s &quot;Third Way&quot; of social democracy. Doer has also been compared with former Premier of Saskatchewan Roy Romanow, who also governed from the centre of the party. Former NDP MLA Cy Gonick wrote a critical essay about Doer in 2007, describing him as a &quot;small-l liberal&quot; without &quot;a socialist bone in his body&quot;.

==Legacy==

Manitoba Wildlands director, Gaile Whelan Enns, said &quot;He has no real policy legacy.&quot; Eric Reder, Manitoba campaign director for the non-profit Wilderness Committee, echoed that assessment. &quot; &quot;The entirety of his term was incremental—little decisions,&quot; Reder said.

The Manitoba government&#x27;s relationship with Monsanto lead to the documentary &quot;Seeds of Change,&quot; which explored negative aspects of the relationship.

Fracking for oil increased dramatically under Doer.

<doc id="270943" wikidata="Q356475" url="?curid=270943" title="Russ Feingold">
<text>Russell Dana Feingold ( ; born March 2, 1953) is an American politician and lawyer who served as a United States Senator from Wisconsin from 1993 to 2011. A member of the Democratic Party, he was its nominee in the 2016 election for the same U.S. Senate seat he had previously occupied. From 1983 to 1993, he was a Wisconsin State Senator representing the 27th District.

With John McCain, Feingold received the 1999 John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award. He and McCain cosponsored the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (McCain–Feingold Act), a major piece of campaign finance reform legislation. He was the only senator to vote against the Patriot Act of 2001.

Feingold was mentioned as a possible candidate in the 2008 presidential election, but in November 2006 announced he would not run. In 2010, Feingold lost his campaign for reelection to the U.S. Senate to Republican nominee Ron Johnson. On June 18, 2013, he was selected by Secretary of State John Kerry to replace R. Barrie Walkley as a special envoy to the Great Lakes region of Africa.

On May 14, 2015, Feingold announced his candidacy for his old Senate seat in 2016. He was defeated by Johnson in a rematch of their 2010 Senate race. In 2020, Feingold became president of the American Constitution Society.

==Early life, education, and career==
Feingold was born in Janesville, Wisconsin, to a Jewish family. His grandparents were immigrants from Russia and Galicia. His father, Leon Feingold (1912–1980), was an attorney; his mother, Sylvia Feingold (née Binstock; 1918–2005), worked at a title company. Feingold was one of four children. Feingold&#x27;s father and his older brother David, a Vietnam War conscientious objector, were the major influences on his political development as a youth. As a boy he was also involved with the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Youth Organization and Aleph Zadik Aleph.

In 1972, Feingold volunteered for the presidential campaign of New York City mayor John Lindsay. He later supported the presidential campaigns of Mo Udall and Ted Kennedy.

After graduating from Joseph A. Craig High School, Feingold attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison and graduated in 1975 with a Bachelor of Arts degree with honors in political science. He was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society and was inducted into the Iron Shield Society, which is considered the highest honor achievable by University of Wisconsin-Madison undergraduate students. Feingold then went to Magdalen College at the University of Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship, where he graduated in 1977 with a first-class honours Bachelor of Arts in jurisprudence. Upon returning to the U.S., he attended Harvard Law School, receiving his J.D. with honors in 1979.

Feingold worked as an attorney at the private law firms of Foley &amp; Lardner and La Follette &amp; Sinykin from 1979 until 1985.

==Wisconsin Senate==
In 1982, Feingold was elected to the Wisconsin Senate, where he served for ten years until his election to the United States Senate. After he was elected to the United States Senate, Feingold was succeeded in the state senate by Joe Wineke.

==U.S. Senate==
=== Elections ===

==== 1992 ====
Feingold&#x27;s senatorial career began in 1992 with a victory over incumbent Republican Senator Bob Kasten. Feingold had little name recognition in the state and was campaigning in a primary against Congressman Jim Moody and businessman Joe Checota, but adopted several proposals to gain the electorate&#x27;s attention. He painted five promises on his garage door, calling it a contract with Wisconsin voters. Among Feingold&#x27;s promises was a pledge to rely on Wisconsin citizens for most of his contributions and a pledge to hold a &quot;listening session&quot; in each of Wisconsin&#x27;s 72 counties each year he was in office.

Feingold released an advertisement featuring an Elvis Presley impersonator endorsing his candidacy. His Republican opponent, Bob Kasten, responded to the ad with one of his own featuring another Elvis impersonator attacking Feingold&#x27;s record.

During the primary campaign, Feingold unveiled an 82-point plan that aimed to eliminate the deficit by the end of his first term. The plan called for a raise in taxes and cuts in the defense budget, among other things, and was derided as &quot;extremist&quot; by Republicans and &quot;too liberal&quot; by his Democratic opponents. Feingold also announced his support for strict campaign finance reform and a national health care system and voiced his opposition to term limits and new tax cuts.

Feingold won by positioning himself as a quirky underdog who offered voters an alternative to what was seen by many as negative campaigning of opponents Jim Moody and Joe Checota. On primary day, Feingold, who had polled in the single digits during much of the campaign, won 70% of the vote. Seven weeks later, while Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, and Ross Perot split the Wisconsin presidential vote 41%-37%-21%, Feingold beat Kasten, 53% to 46%.

==== 1998 ====

During his 1998 reelection campaign, Feingold was outspent by his Republican opponent, Representative Mark Neumann, and targeted by the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Feingold placed a cap on his own fundraising, pledging not to raise or spend more than $3.8 million (one dollar for every citizen of Wisconsin) during the campaign, and turning away Democratic Party soft money. He requested that several lobby groups, including the AFL–CIO and the League of Conservation Voters, refrain from airing pro-Feingold &quot;issue ads&quot;. Some Democrats were angry at Feingold for &quot;putting his career at risk&quot; with these self-imposed limits. Neumann also limited himself to $3.8 million in spending, but allowed soft money to be used in his favor by outside groups. A strong showing in the Democratic strongholds of Milwaukee and Madison allowed Feingold to win the election by about two percentage points.

==== 2004 ====
In the 2004 Senate election, Feingold defeated the Republican candidate, businessman Tim Michels, by 11 percentage points (55%-44%), earning a third term. During the campaign, Feingold refrained from imposing spending caps on himself as he had in the past, and raised and spent almost $11 million. In 2004, Feingold spent nearly $3.7 million, or about 67%, more than his opponent. PolitiFact.com rated Feingold&#x27;s frequent assertion that he had been outspent by opponents in every U.S. Senate election &quot;pants on fire.&quot;

In late December 2004, Feingold was appointed to be one of four deputy whips for the Senate Democrats.

==== 2010 ====

Feingold was defeated for reelection on November 2, 2010, by Oshkosh businessman Ron Johnson, 52% to 47%.

==== 2016 ====
On May 14, 2015, Feingold announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate against the incumbent, Republican Ron Johnson.

In his 2016 campaign, Feingold said he would no longer adhere to his longstanding pledge to raise the majority of his campaign funds from Wisconsin residents. Feingold said the pledge had been made on an election-to-election basis and no longer made sense. As of March 2016, Feingold had raised the most money among all U.S. Senate candidates challenging an incumbent. Nearly three-fourths of his individual contributions were from outside Wisconsin.

Groups financially supporting Feingold&#x27;s election bid included Planned Parenthood, the League of Conservation Voters, American Bridge 21st Century, and the National Abortion Rights Action League. In May 2016, Senator Bernie Sanders endorsed Feingold and engaged in fundraising for him.

In the November 8, 2016, general election, Feingold was defeated by Johnson. Feingold received slightly less than 47%, and Johnson received slightly more than 50%, of the vote.

==Tenure==

During his time in the U.S. Senate, Feingold gained a reputation as a political maverick with an independent streak. When he broke with his own party, it was often because he was taking a more liberal or populist position than other Democrats. Throughout his congressional tenure, several ranking systems placed Feingold among the nation&#x27;s most liberal or progressive senators.

During the impeachment trial of Bill Clinton, Feingold was the only Democratic senator to vote against a motion to dismiss Congress&#x27;s impeachment case against President Bill Clinton. Feingold ultimately voted against conviction on all charges.

Feingold opposed NAFTA and numerous other free trade agreements.
In 2001, Feingold was the only senator to vote against the Patriot Act (H.R. 3162). Also in 2001, Feingold voted for the confirmation of Attorney General John Ashcroft.

On December 21, 2004, Feingold wrote an article for the website &quot;Salon&quot; about a golfing trip to Greenville, Alabama. After noting how friendly the people were, and that Wisconsin had many similar places, he expressed his sorrow that such a poverty-stricken area was &quot;the reddest spot on the whole map&quot; despite Republican policies that Feingold considered destructive to the well-being of the poor and middle class. Alabama Governor Bob Riley and Greenville Mayor Dexter McLendon, both Republicans, were perturbed at Feingold&#x27;s description of &quot;check-cashing stores and abject trailer parks, and some of the hardest-used cars for sale on a very rundown lot.&quot; McLendon invited Feingold back for a more complete tour of the city, and Feingold agreed. He visited the city on March 28, 2005, making amends and increasing speculation about his presidential plans for 2008.

In May 2006, Feingold voted in favor of bill S.2611, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006, an immigration reform bill that was designed to give most illegal immigrants a chance to become legal citizens.

Feingold co-sponsored a number of failed bills calling for the abolition of the death penalty.

In 2009, Feingold voted against confirmation of Timothy Geithner to be United States Secretary of the Treasury, citing Geithner&#x27;s personal tax issues. Also in 2009, Feingold announced that he was planning to introduce a constitutional amendment that would prohibit governors from making temporary Senate appointments instead of holding special elections.

Feingold cosponsored the Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act, which was signed into law in October 2009.

===Campaign finance reform===
Feingold is perhaps best known for his work with Senator John McCain on the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, better known as the McCain–Feingold Act. The legislation, which took seven years to pass, became defunct in the wake of several U.S. Supreme Court decisions.

===Wall Street reform===
On May 20, 2010, Feingold was one of two Democratic senators to vote against the Dodd–Frank Wall Street reform bill, citing his belief that the measures did not go far enough. On July 15, 2010, he became the only Democratic senator to vote against the bill when it was brought up again; it passed by a 60–39 vote.

===Patriot Act===
Feingold was the only senator to vote against the Patriot Act when it was first introduced in 2001, saying that its provisions infringed upon citizens&#x27; civil liberties.

When the bill was up for renewal in late December 2005, Feingold led a bipartisan coalition of senators – including Lisa Murkowski, Ken Salazar, Larry Craig, Dick Durbin and John Sununu – to remove some of the act&#x27;s more controversial provisions. Feingold led a filibuster against renewal of the act. In February 2006, the Senate voted 96–3 to break the filibuster and to extend the Patriot Act.

In 2009, when the act was again up for reauthorization, Feingold introduced the JUSTICE Act (S. 1686) &quot;To place reasonable safeguards on the use of surveillance and other authorities under the USA PATRIOT Act.&quot; Senator Patrick Leahy then introduced an alternative bill, about which Feingold later said &quot;...while narrower than the JUSTICE Act that Senator Durbin and I have championed, [it] did contain several important and necessary protections for the privacy of innocent Americans.&quot; After what Feingold saw as the further watering down of civil liberty protections in the bill, it passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on October 8 by a vote of 11 to 8 with Feingold voting against it.

===War in Iraq===
Feingold was one of 23 senators to vote against H.J. Resolution 114, which authorized President George W. Bush to use force against Iraq in 2002.

On August 17, 2005, he became the first senator to call for the withdrawal of troops from Iraq and urge that a timetable for that withdrawal be set. He called other Democrats &quot;timid&quot; for refusing to take action sooner, and suggested December 31, 2006, as the date for total withdrawal of troops. On the subject of Bush&#x27;s assertion that a deadline would be helpful to Iraqi insurgents, Feingold said, &quot;I think he&#x27;s wrong. I think not talking about endgames is playing into our enemies&#x27; hand.&quot;

On April 27, 2006, Feingold announced that he would move to amend an appropriations bill granting $106.5 billion in emergency spending measure for Iraq and Hurricane Katrina relief to require that troops withdraw completely from Iraq.

===Call for a vote of censure against President Bush===
On March 14, 2006, Feingold introduced a resolution in the Senate to censure President Bush. This was a result of allegations of illegal wiretapping under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA), which mandates use of a surveillance court for approval of wiretaps on Americans. Feingold made a 25-minute speech on the Senate floor, declaring that Congress must &quot;hold the president accountable for his actions&quot;. It received support from Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and Barbara Boxer of California, but most Democratic senators avoided expressing an opinion on it. Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and Patrick Leahy of Vermont expressed support for the bill, but Feingold was able to find only three co-sponsors.

Feingold again called for Bush&#x27;s censure in July 2007 for his management of the Iraq war, accusing him of mounting an &quot;assault&quot; against the United States Constitution.

===Health care policy===

Feingold supports the creation of a system of universal health care in America. During his first run for the Senate, he endorsed the single-payer model, in which the government pays for all healthcare costs.

On July 24, 2006, at a press conference at the Martin Luther King Heritage Health Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Feingold announced that he had authored the State-Based Health Care Reform Act, a bill to create a pilot program for a system of universal healthcare under which each U.S. state would create a program to provide its citizenry with universal health insurance and the federal government would provide the funding. The bill would create a nonpartisan &quot;Health Care Reform Task Force,&quot; which would provide five-year federal grants to two or three states. The program was expected to cost $32 billion over 10 years.

Feingold voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that passed the Senate on December 24, 2009.

===Gun policy===
Feingold has voted in favor of certain gun-control legislation while also voting to expand certain gun rights. He signed the congressional amicus brief in &quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court case that overturned a handgun ban in Washington, D.C.

Feingold has voted in favor of bills to require background checks for handgun buyers, to require background checks for firearms purchases at gun shows, and to require that handguns be sold with trigger locks. He supported President Barack Obama&#x27;s 2016 executive orders to expand background checks and strengthen enforcement of existing gun laws.

===Social issues===
Feingold supports abortion rights.

In 1996, Feingold was in a minority of legislators who voted against the Defense of Marriage Act, which President Bill Clinton signed into law. In an April 4, 2006 interview, Feingold announced that he favored the legalization of same-sex marriage.

On May 18, 2006, Feingold walked out of a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee shortly before a vote on a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. Feingold objected to both the amendment and decision of Chairman Arlen Specter (R-PA at the time) to move the meeting to an area of the Capitol Building not open to the public. Later that day, the committee voted to send the amendment to the full Senate.

==2008 possible presidential bid==
In late January 2005, Feingold told the Tiger Bay Club of Volusia County, Florida that he intended to travel around the country before deciding whether or not to run in 2008. In March 2005, his Senate campaign staff registered the domain www.russfeingold08.com, as well as the .org and .net versions. On June 1, 2005, Feingold launched a political action committee (PAC), the Progressive Patriots Fund. A &quot;draft Feingold&quot; movement was established independently of his campaign.

On August 17, 2005, Feingold became the first U.S. Senator of either party to suggest a firm date for American withdrawal from the Iraq War, saying that he favored a complete withdrawal by no later than December 31, 2006.

Feingold supported John Roberts&#x27;s Supreme Court nomination in September 2005, and was one of three Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee to vote in favor of sending the nomination to the floor for a final vote. Feingold graduated from Harvard Law School the same year as Roberts, 1979. Four months later, in January 2006, he voted against Samuel Alito&#x27;s nomination to the Court in committee and against cloture of debate on the nomination.

Considered a long shot for president, Feingold announced in November 2006 that he would not seek his party&#x27;s nomination in 2008. He said that a presidential campaign would detract from his focus on the Senate, and the resulting scrutiny &quot;would dismantle both my professional life (in the Senate) and my personal life.&quot; In his parting comments he warned his supporters against supporting anyone for the presidency who voted for the Iraq War, whether they later regretted it or not, saying his first choice for president in 2008 was someone who voted against the war, and his second choice is someone who was not in Congress but spoke out against the war at the time.

On February 22, 2008, he said he had voted for Obama in Wisconsin&#x27;s Democratic presidential primary election.

== Post-congressional career ==
Following his 2010 defeat, Feingold was appointed a visiting professor at Marquette University Law School. He wrote a book titled &quot;While America Sleeps: A Wake-Up Call to the Post-9/11 World&quot;, and supported Obama&#x27;s reelection in 2012. In February 2012, it was announced that Feingold would be a co-chair of Obama&#x27;s reelection campaign. In 2012, he was the Mimi and Peter E. Haas Distinguished Visitor at Stanford Law School. In 2012–13, he was the Stephen Edward Scarff Distinguished Visiting professor at Lawrence University.
In February 2011, Feingold formed Progressives United, a Political Action Committee, and an affiliated nonprofit entity called Progressives United Inc. Progressives United&#x27;s stated aim was &quot;directly and indirectly supporting candidates who stand up for our progressive ideals.&quot; From 2011 to 2015, the two groups raised and spent $10 million. The PAC has helped raise money for more than 50 progressive candidates, including the largest beneficiary, then-candidate Elizabeth Warren, who successfully defeated incumbent Scott Brown in 2012. Progressives United Inc. shut down in late 2014, and the Progressives United PAC suspended its fundraising activities in May 2015 in order to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest with Feingold&#x27;s 2016 Senate campaign.

Feingold had received encouragement from Democrats to run for office in an expected recall election against Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, but in August 2011 he announced that he had no plans to run for office in 2012 in either a gubernatorial recall election or the election to Wisconsin&#x27;s other U.S. senate seat.

On June 18, 2013, Feingold was appointed United States Special Representative for the African Great Lakes region and the Democratic Republic of the Congo by United States Secretary of State John Kerry. He announced his departure from the position on February 24, 2015.

In 2016, Feingold ran for his former senate seat and lost the election to Johnson again.

In November 2019, Feingold became a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

In February 2020, Feingold was named president of the American Constitution Society.

==Personal life==
Feingold resides in Middleton, Wisconsin. He is a member of Beth Hillel Temple in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where his sister, Dena Feingold, is rabbi.

Feingold was married to Sue Levine from 1977 until 1986. They had two children. He married Mary Speerschneider in 1991; in 2005, the couple announced they would divorce. In 2013, Feingold married Dr. Christine Ferdinand, a fellow at Magdalen College at Oxford University in England.

In 2011, Feingold received a Freedom Medal from the Roosevelt Institute.

<text>Tahir &quot;Tie&quot; Domi (born November 1, 1969) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. Known as an enforcer, he played for the Toronto Maple Leafs, New York Rangers, and Winnipeg Jets over a 16-year NHL career. He is the Maple Leafs&#x27; all-time leader in penalty minutes, and he is third overall in penalty minutes in NHL history. He is also the player with the most fighting majors in NHL history, with 333.

==Playing career==

===Minor and junior===
Domi was born in Windsor, Ontario, to Albanian parents, and grew up in nearby Belle River (now part of Lakeshore). As a child, he played minor hockey for the local Belle River Rink Rats of the Ontario Minor Hockey Association. When he was 15, Domi played for the Belle River Canadiens of the Great Lakes Junior C Hockey League, later moving up a level the following year to play with the Windsor Bulldogs of the Western Junior B Hockey League.

At the 1986 Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Priority Selection, he was drafted in the seventh round (102nd overall) by the Peterborough Petes. Domi began his major junior career in 1986–87, spending his first year as a part-time player with the Petes, while also appearing with the nearby Peterborough Roadrunners in the Metro Junior A Hockey League. In his first full season with the Petes in 1987–88, he recorded an OHL career-high 22 goals and 43 points over 60 games, to go along with 292 penalty minutes, earning a reputation as an enforcer.

During the off-season, he was selected in the second round (27th overall) by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1988 NHL Entry Draft. Upon his selection, Domi returned to the Petes for one more season of junior, recording 14 goals and 30 points over 43 games.

===Early professional career===
Domi turned professional in 1989–90 with Toronto&#x27;s American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Newmarket Saints, recording 14 goals and 25 points over 57 games, along with 285 penalty minutes. He also made his NHL debut that season, appearing in two games with the Leafs in which he accumulated 42 penalty minutes. In the off-season, he was traded to the New York Rangers. He split the subsequent year between New York and their AHL affiliate, the Binghamton Rangers. During his 28 games with New York in 1990–91, he scored his first NHL goal on March 23, 1991, against the Philadelphia Flyers. After playing a full NHL campaign with the Rangers in 1991–92, Domi was traded early the following season to the Winnipeg Jets.

===Toronto Maple Leafs===
In 1995, Domi was traded back to the Toronto Maple Leafs. That year, he famously knocked New York Rangers defenceman Ulf Samuelsson unconscious with a sucker punch to the face. Domi was suspended 8 games and heavily fined for the incident, described by some as one of the cheapest shots in NHL history. Domi insisted that Samuelsson provoked the punch by repeatedly calling him &quot;dummy&quot;. In the 1997–98 season, Domi set a Leafs single-season record with 365 penalty minutes, passing a mark set by Tiger Williams in 1977–78.

During the 2000–01 season, Domi was involved in an incident with a fan during an away game on March 29, 2001, against the Philadelphia Flyers. Sitting in the penalty box, Domi used his water bottle to spray water at a heckler, prompting another Flyers fan, Christopher Falcone, to begin yelling at him and climbing up the glass. The glass panel gave way, and Falcone fell into the penalty box and Domi then grabbed Falcone and punched him several times. After the game in an interview, Domi said to the media, &quot;It&#x27;s nice to see the fans get involved, I guess.&quot; Domi was fined $1000, the maximum allowable at the time by the NHLPA&#x27;s collective bargaining agreement, but received no suspension.

On May 3, 2001, in the closing seconds of Game 4 of the 2001 Eastern Conference Semi-finals, well away from the play, Domi threw an elbow at the head of New Jersey Devils defenceman Scott Niedermayer, knocking him unconscious. Domi was assessed a game misconduct and the following day, was suspended by the league for the remainder of the playoffs, with the condition that if Toronto did not advance to the following round, then Domi was to sit out the first 8 games of the 2001-02 NHL season. Toronto was eliminated by New Jersey in Game 7, and Domi&#x27;s suspension subsequently carried over into the following season.

On June 30, 2002, ahead of his unrestricted free agency, Domi&#x27;s rights were traded to the Nashville Predators by Toronto for Nashville&#x27;s 8th round choice (Shaun Landolt) in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. Nashville was unable to sign him, with Domi later re-signing with Toronto as a free agent on July 13, 2002. He had his best season in the 2002-03 NHL season, when he set career highs of 15 goals and 29 points.

In what turned out to be his final season of 2005–06, Domi scored his 100th NHL goal. Also, Domi played his 1,000th career NHL game, on March 3, 2006, against the Buffalo Sabres. Seven days later, on March 10, 2006, Domi was a healthy scratch for the Maple Leafs&#x27; game versus the New York Islanders, which was the first time since the 1999 playoffs that he had been made a healthy scratch by coach Pat Quinn. Domi stated publicly that he was not happy with being benched, a fact that was underlined by his staying in his hotel room, not arriving at the game until after the second period and was widely regarded as a contributing factor in the decision to buy out his contract.

On June 30, 2006, the Maple Leafs opted to buy out the final year of Domi&#x27;s contract. He became a free agent on July 1, 2006. Without a contract several months later, Domi announced his retirement on September 19.

Domi is the all-time NHL leader in fights with 333.

==Off the ice==

===Media and entertainment===
During his NHL career, Domi also appeared in three films, playing a role in the 1999 independent film &quot;Men of Means&quot;, while also making a cameo appearance in the hockey-themed drama &quot;Mystery, Alaska&quot;. In 2007 Domi played himself in a season 2 episode of Canadian sitcom Rent-a-Goalie titled &quot;Domi Daze&quot;.

Following his retirement, Domi accepted a position in broadcasting with The Sports Network (TSN), a stint that lasted less than a month.

In October 2009, Domi began competing as a pairs figure skater on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reality show &quot;Battle of the Blades&quot; with Christine Hough.

Domi is currently a spokesperson for Comwave, a telecommunications company.

===Soccer and Canadian football===
Domi has also been involved in soccer and Canadian football at the professional and semi-professional levels. He was scouted by the University of Michigan for both sports while in high school. He played a full season for Kosovo of the Canadian International Soccer League during the summer of 1995, and appeared in two pre-season exhibition games as a placekicker for the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League.

===Family===
Domi has three children from his marriage to his ex-wife, Leanne: daughters Carlin and Avery Rose, and son Max, who is a current NHL player. Domi&#x27;s 13-year marriage ended in divorce in 2006. In 2017, he married Heather McDonough, and the couple live in New York City.

===Controversy===
During the 2012 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament, an international under-18 competition Max was participating in, Domi allegedly stole a video camera belonging to a Swedish coach, who was recording the Canadian team&#x27;s practice – a legal practice. Domi took the unmanned camera before later returning it without the battery.

<text>Paul I of Constantinople or &quot;Saint Paul the Confessor&quot; (Greek: Παῦλος; died 350), was the sixth bishop of Constantinople, elected first in 337. Paul I became involved in the Arian controversy which drew in the Emperor of the West, Constans, and his counterpart in the East, his brother Roman emperor Constantius II. Paul I was installed and deposed three times from the See of Constantinople between 337 and 350. He was murdered by strangulation during his third and final exile in Cappadocia. His feast day is on 6 November.

== Biography ==
He was a native of Thessalonica, a presbyter of Constantinople, and secretary to the aged bishop Alexander of Constantinople, his predecessor in the see. Both the city and its inhabitants suffered much during the Arian controversies. No sooner had Alexander breathed his last than the Arian and Orthodox parties came into open conflict. The Orthodox party prevailed; in 337 Paul was elected and consecrated by bishops who happened to be at Constantinople in the Church of Peace, close to what was afterwards the Hagia Sophia.

=== First exile ===
The Roman emperor Constantius II had been away during these events. On his return, he was angry at not having been consulted. He summoned a synod of Arian bishops, declared Paul I quite unfit for the bishopric, banished him, and transported Eusebius of Nicomedia to Constantinople. This is thought to have been around 339. Paul I, seeing himself rendered useless to his flock, while Arianism reigned in the East under the protection of Constantius II, took shelter in the West, in the dominions of Constans. He went to Rome where he met Patriarch Athanasius of Alexandria, who also had been expelled from his see.

Athanasius of Alexandria was then in exile from Alexandria, Marcellus of Ancyra, and Asclepas from Gaza; with them, Paul I betook himself to Rome and consulted Pope Julius I, who examined their cases severally, found them all staunch to the creed of Nicaea, admitted them to communion, espoused their cause, and wrote strongly to the bishops of the East. Athanasius and Paul I recovered their sees; the Eastern bishops replied to Pope Julius I altogether declining to act on his advice.

=== Second exile ===
Paul I returned to Constantinople. Eusebius died in 341, and Paul I was reinstated as bishop. The Arians seized the occasion; Theognis of Nicaea, Theodorus of Heraclea, and other heterodox bishops, consecrated bishop Macedonius I of Constantinople in the church of Saint Paul; and again the city became the prey of a civil war.

The Emperor Constantius II was at Antioch when he heard of this, where he ordered Hermogenes, his general of cavalry, to see that Paul I was again expelled. The people would not hear of violence being done to their bishop; they rushed upon the house where the general was, set fire to it, killed him on the spot, tied a rope round his feet, pulled him out from the burning building, and dragged him in triumph round the city. Constantius II was not likely to pass over this rebellion against his authority. He rode on horseback at full speed to Constantinople, determined to make the people suffer heavily for their revolt. They met him, however, on their knees with tears and entreaties, and he contented himself with depriving them of half their allowance of corn but ordered Paul I to be driven from the city.

=== Third exile ===
Paul I seems to have retired to Triers, but returned to Constantinople in 344, with letters of recommendation from Constans, the emperor of the West, who wrote to Constantius II, that should Paul I not receive his patriarchal see, he would attack him. Constantius II only allowed Paul I&#x27;s re-establishment for fear of his brother&#x27;s arms, and Paul I&#x27;s situation in the East continued very uneasy, for he had much to suffer from the power and malice of the Arian party.

Constans died in 350. Constantius II, in Antioch, ordered Philippus, prefect of the East, to once more expel Paul I and to put Macedonius I of Constantinople in his place. At a public bath called Zeuxippus, adjoining a palace by the shore of the Bosphorus, Philippus asked Paul I to meet him as if to discuss some public business. When Paul I arrived, he showed him the emperor&#x27;s letter and ordered him to be quietly taken through the palace to the waterside, placed on board ship, and carried off to Thessalonica, his native town. Philippus allowed him to visit Illyricum and the remote provinces, but forbade him to set foot again in the East.

Paul I was later loaded with chains and taken to Singara in Mesopotamia, then to Emesa, and finally to Cucusus in Cappadocia. Here he was confined in a close, dark place, and left to starve to death. After he had passed six days without food, he was, to the great disappointment of his enemies, found alive. Upon which they strangled him, and gave out that he died after a short sickness.

Paul I&#x27;s body was brought to Ancyra in Galatia, and, by the order of Theodosius I, was thence translated to Constantinople in 381, about thirty years after his death. It was buried there in the great church built by Macedonius, which from that time was known by no other name than that of St. Paul. His remains were removed to Venice in 1226, where they are kept with great respect in the church of St. Laurence.

<doc id="270981" wikidata="Q422054" url="?curid=270981" title="Aramid">
<text>Aramid fibers, short for aromatic polyamide, are a class of heat-resistant and strong synthetic fibers. They are used in aerospace and military applications, for ballistic-rated body armor fabric and ballistic composites, in marine cordage, marine hull reinforcement, as an asbestos substitute, and in various lightweight consumer items ranging from phone cases to tennis rackets.

The chain molecules in the fibers are highly oriented along the fiber axis. As a result, a higher proportion of the chemical bond contributes more to fiber strength than in many other synthetic fibres in the world. Aramids have a very high melting point (&gt;).

Common aramid brand names include Kevlar, Nomex, and Twaron.

==Terminology and chemical structure==

The term &quot;aramid&quot; is shortened from &quot;aromatic polyamide&quot;. It was introduced in 1972, accepted in 1974 by the Federal Trade Commission of the USA as the name of a generic category of fiber distinct from nylon, and adopted by the International Organization for Standardization in 1977.

&quot;Aromatic&quot; in the longer name refers to the presence of aromatic rings of six carbon atoms. In aramids these rings are connected via amide linkages each comprising a CO group attached to an NH group.

In order to meet the FTC definition of an aramid, at least 85% of these linkages must be attached to two aromatic rings. Below 85%, the material is instead classed as nylon.

===Para-aramids and meta-aramids===
Aramids are divided into two main types according to where the linkages attach to the rings. Numbering the carbon atoms sequentially around a ring, para-aramids have the linkages attached at positions 1 and 4, while meta-aramids have them at positions 1 and 3. That is, the attachment points are diametrically opposite each other in para-aramids, and two atoms apart in meta-aramids. The illustration thus shows a para-aramid.

==History==

Aromatic polyamides were first introduced in commercial applications in the early 1960s, with a meta-aramid fiber produced by DuPont as HT-1 and then under the trade name Nomex. This fiber, which handles similarly to normal textile apparel fibers, is characterized by its excellent resistance to heat, as it neither melts nor ignites in normal levels of oxygen. It is used extensively in the production of protective apparel, air filtration, thermal and electrical insulation, as well as a substitute for asbestos.

Meta-aramids are also produced in the Netherlands and Japan by Teijin Aramid under the trade name Teijinconex, and by Toray under the trade name Arawin, in China by Yantai Tayho under the trade name New Star and by SRO Group under the trade name X-Fiper, and a variant of meta-aramid in France by Kermel under the trade name Kermel.

Based on earlier research by Monsanto Company and Bayer, para-aramid fiber with much higher tenacity and elastic modulus was also developed in the 1960s and 1970s by DuPont and AkzoNobel, both profiting from their knowledge of rayon, polyester and nylon processing. In 1973, DuPont was the first company to introduce a para-aramid fiber, calling it Kevlar; this remains one of the best-known para-aramids and/or aramids.

In 1978, Akzo introduced a similar fiber with roughly the same chemical structure calling it Twaron. Due to earlier patents on the production process, Akzo and DuPont engaged in a patent dispute in the 1980s. Twaron subsequently came under the ownership of the Teijin Aramid Company. In 2011, Yantai Tayho introduced similar fiber which is called Taparan in China (see Production).

Para-aramids are used in many high-tech applications, such as aerospace and military applications, for &quot;bullet-proof&quot; body armor fabric.

Both meta-aramid and para-aramid fiber can be used to make aramid paper. Aramid paper is used as electrical insulation materials and construction materials to make honeycomb core. Dupont made aramid paper during the 1960s, calling it Nomex paper. Yantai Metastar Special Paper introduced an aramid paper in 2007, which is called metastar paper. Both Dupont and Yantai Metastar make meta-aramid and para-aramid paper.

==Health==
During the 1990s, an &quot;in vitro&quot; test of aramid fibers showed they exhibited &quot;many of the same effects on epithelial cells as did asbestos, including increased radiolabeled nucleotide incorporation into DNA and induction of ODC (ornithine decarboxylase) enzyme activity&quot;, raising the possibility of carcinogenic implications. However, in 2009, it was shown that inhaled aramid fibrils are shortened and quickly cleared from the body and pose little risk. A declaration of interest correction was later provided by the author of the study stating that &quot;This review was commissioned and funded by DuPont and Teijin Aramid, but the author alone was responsible for the content and writing of the paper.&quot;

==Production==

World capacity of para-aramid production was estimated at per year in 2002 and increases each year by 5–10%. In 2007 this means a total production capacity of around 55,000 tonnes per year.

===Polymer preparation===
Aramids are generally prepared by the reaction between an amine group and a carboxylic acid halide group. Simple AB homopolymers have the connectivity −(NH−C6H4−CO)&quot;n&quot;−.

Well-known aramid polymers such as Kevlar, Twaron, Nomex, New Star, and Teijinconex) are prepared from diamine and diacid (or equivalent) precursors. These polymers can be further classified according to the linkages on the aromatic subunits. Nomex, Teijinconex, and New Star contain predominantly the meta-linkage. They are called poly-metaphenylene isophthalamides (MPIAs). By contrast, Kevlar and Twaron both feature para-linkages. They are called &quot;p&quot;-phenylene terephthalamides (PPTAs). PPTA is a product of &quot;p&quot;-phenylene diamine (PPD) and terephthaloyl dichloride (TDC or TCl).

Production of PPTA relies on a co-solvent with an ionic component (calcium chloride, CaCl2) to occupy the hydrogen bonds of the amide groups, and an organic component (&quot;N&quot;-methyl pyrrolidone, NMP) to dissolve the aromatic polymer. This process was invented by Leo Vollbracht at Akzo. Apart from the carcinogenic HMPT, still no practical alternative of dissolving the polymer is known. The use of the NMP/CaCl2 system led to an extended patent dispute between Akzo and DuPont.

===Spinning===
After production of the polymer, the aramid fiber is produced by spinning the dissolved polymer to a solid fiber from a liquid chemical blend. Polymer solvent for spinning PPTA is generally 100% anhydrous sulfuric acid (H2SO4).

==Other types of aramids==

Besides meta-aramids like Nomex, other variations belong to the aramid fiber range. These are mainly of the copolyamide type, best known under the brand name Technora, as developed by Teijin and introduced in 1976. The manufacturing process of Technora reacts PPD and 3,4&#x27;-diaminodiphenylether (3,4&#x27;-ODA) with terephthaloyl chloride (TCl).
This relatively simple process uses only one amide solvent, and therefore spinning can be done directly after the polymer production.

==Aramid fiber characteristics==

Aramids share a high degree of orientation with other fibers such as ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene, a characteristic that dominates their properties.

===General===
* good resistance to abrasion
* good resistance to organic solvents
* nonconductive 
* very high melting point (&gt;)
* low flammability
* good fabric integrity at elevated temperatures
* sensitive to acids and salts 
* sensitive to ultraviolet radiation 
* prone to electrostatic charge build-up unless finished

===Para-aramids===
* para-aramid fibers, such as Kevlar and Twaron, provide outstanding strength-to-weight properties
* high chord modulus
* high tenacity
* low creep
* low elongation at break (~3.5%)
* difficult to dye – usually solution-dyed

==Uses==
* flame-resistant clothing
* heat-protective clothing and helmets
* body armor, competing with polyethylene-based fiber products such as Dyneema and Spectra

* asbestos replacement (e.g. brake linings)
* hot air filtration fabrics
* tires, newly as Sulfron (sulfur-modified Twaron)
* mechanical rubber goods reinforcement
* ropes and cables

<text>Truevision TGA, often referred to as TARGA, is a raster graphics file format created by Truevision Inc. (now part of Avid Technology). It was the native format of TARGA and VISTA boards, which were the first graphic cards for IBM-compatible PCs to support &quot;high color&quot; or &quot;true color&quot; display. This family of graphic cards was intended for professional computer image synthesis and video editing with PCs; for this reason, usual resolutions of TGA image files match those of the NTSC and PAL video formats.

TARGA is an acronym for &quot; Truevision Advanced Raster Graphics Adapter&quot;; &quot;TGA&quot; is an initialism for &quot; Truevision Graphics Adapter&quot;.

TGA files commonly have the extension &quot;.tga&quot; on PC DOS/Windows systems and macOS (older Macintosh systems use the &quot;TPIC&quot; type code). The format itself permits any pixel bit depth up to 255, of which up to 15 bits can be dedicated to an alpha channel; however, the only bit depths supported in practice were 8, 15, 16, 24, and 32, where the 16- and 32-bit formats used 1 and 8 bits respectively for the alpha channel. Color data can be color-mapped, or in direct color or truecolor format. Image data may be stored raw, or optionally, a lossless RLE compression similar to PackBits can be employed. This type of compression performs poorly for typical photographic images, but works acceptably well for simpler images, such as icons, cartoons and line drawings.

==History==
The TGA file format was originally defined and specified by AT&amp;T EPICenter with feedback from Island Graphics Inc in 1984. AT&amp;T EPICenter was an internal spin-off of AT&amp;T created to market new technologies AT&amp;T had developed for color frame buffers. What later became Truevision was the result of a leveraged employee buyout from AT&amp;T in 1987.

EPICenter&#x27;s first two cards, the VDA (video display adapter) and ICB (image capture board), used the first incarnations of the TGA file format. The file extensions &quot;.vda&quot; and &quot;.icb&quot; implied information about the board specific data contained.

It was later determined by Alan Wlasuk (then head of EPICenter), Brad Pillow (EPICenter) and Steven Dompier (Island&#x27;s president) that a more codified file format was needed. The file format was created and implemented by Brad Pillow (EPICenter) and Bryan Hunt (EPICenter) and was developed in response to this need for a less board specific file format. A very simple extension was made to what was already in use, and contained information on width, height, pixel depth, an associated color map and image origin. A label field (up to 255 characters) was also included in the initial spec, but was rarely used.

At the time, another technically superior file format called TIFF also appeared, but its use for true color images was very limited as the implementation and sharing of files between applications supporting the TIFF specification was rather difficult and involved. The TGA file format&#x27;s simpler nature and portability between platforms is the main reason for its widespread adoption and its continued success in a wide variety of applications worldwide to this day.

Initially the TGA file format was used in the ICB-PAINT and TARGA-PAINT programs (what later became known as TIPS) and for several projects in online real estate browsing and still-frame video teleconferencing.

The current version (2.0) includes several enhancements such as &quot;postage stamps&quot; (better known as thumbnails), an alpha channel, gamma value, and textual metadata, and was authored by Truevision Inc.&#x27;s Shawn Steiner with direction from Kevin Friedly and David Spoelstra in 1989.

At the time of its launching, it represented the state of the art in digital image processing. Even today, though its maximum color depth is not well suited for high-end pre-press, intensive image processing systems, TGA is still used extensively throughout the animation and video industry because its primary intended outputs are standard TV screens, not color printed pages.

Uncompressed 24-bit TGA images are relatively simple compared to several other prominent 24-bit storage formats: A 24-bit TGA contains only an 18-byte header followed by the image data as packed RGB data. In contrast, BMP requires padding rows to 4-byte boundaries, while TIFF and PNG are metadata containers that do not place the image data or attributes at a fixed location within the file.

32-bit TGA images contain an alpha channel, or key signal, and are often used in character generator programs such as Avid Deko.

==Technical details==
All values are little-endian; field and subfield numbers are per Version 2.0 of the specification.

Version 2 added the extension area and footer. The developer area exists to store application-specific information.

=== Header ===
Image ID length (field 1)

0–255
The number of bytes that the image ID field consists of.
The image ID field can contain any information, but it is common for it to contain the date and time the image was created or a serial number.

As of version 2.0 of the TGA spec, the date and time the image was created is catered for in the extension area.

Color map type (field 2)

has the value:
* 0 if image file contains no color map
* 1 if present
* 2–127 reserved by Truevision
* 128–255 available for developer use

Image type (field 3)

is enumerated in the lower three bits, with the fourth bit as a flag for RLE. Some possible values are:
* 0 no image data is present
* 1 uncompressed color-mapped image
* 2 uncompressed true-color image
* 3 uncompressed grayscale image
* 9 run-length encoded color-mapped image
* 10 run-length encoded true-color image
* 11 run-length encoded grayscale image

Image type 1 and 9: Depending on the Pixel Depth value, image data representation is an 8, 15, or 16 bit index into a color map that defines the color of the pixel.
Image type 2 and 10: The image data is a direct representation of the pixel color. For a Pixel Depth of 15 and 16 bit, each pixel is stored with 5 bits per color. If the pixel depth is 16 bits, the topmost bit is reserved for transparency. For a pixel depth of 24 bits, each pixel is stored with 8 bits per color. A 32-bit pixel depth defines an additional 8-bit alpha channel.
Image type 3 and 11: The image data is a direct representation of grayscale data. The pixel depth is 8 bits for images of this type.

Color map specification (field 4)

has three subfields:
* First entry index (2 bytes): index of first color map entry that is included in the file
* Color map length (2 bytes): number of entries of the color map that are included in the file
* Color map entry size (1 byte): number of bits per color map entry
In case that not the entire color map is actually used by the image, a non-zero first entry index allows to store only a required part of the color map in the file.

Image specification (field 5)

has six subfields:
* X-origin (2 bytes): absolute coordinate of lower-left corner for displays where origin is at the lower left
* Y-origin (2 bytes): as for X-origin
* Image width (2 bytes): width in pixels
* Image height (2 bytes): height in pixels
* Pixel depth (1 byte): bits per pixel
* Image descriptor (1 byte): bits 3–0 give the alpha channel depth, bits 5–4 give pixel ordering

Bit 4 of the image descriptor byte indicates right-to-left pixel ordering if set. Bit 5 indicates an ordering of top-to-bottom. Otherwise, pixels are stored in bottom-to-top, left-to-right order.

=== Image and color map data ===
=== Developer area (optional) ===

Version 1.0 of the TGA specification was very basic, and many developers had a need to store more information, and so opted to add on extra sections to their files, specific to their application only.

In Version 2.0 of the specification, these application-specific enhancements/extras are supported by the developer area. Only the offset and size of the developer area are relevant to the spec, and developers are free to add whatever they want in the area.

If a TGA decoder cannot interpret the information in the developer area, it will generally ignore it, since it is assumed to have been created by a different application. It is recommended that developers build logic into their applications to determine whether the data in the developer area is compatible with the application; one step towards this is to check the software ID in the file footer.

=== Extension area (optional) ===
=== File footer (optional) ===
If a TGA file contains a footer, it is likely to be a TGA version 2 file. The footer is the final 26 bytes of the file, of which the last 18 are constant.

=== Specification discrepancies ===
The older version of the TGA file format specification taken from the Appendix C of the Truevision Technical Guide states that run-length encoded (RLE) packets may cross scan lines: &quot;For the run length packet, the header is followed by a single color value, which is assumed to be repeated the number of times specified in the header. The packet may cross scan lines (begin on one line and end on the next)&quot;.

However, page 24 of the TGA v2.0 specification states the exact opposite: &quot;Run-length Packets should never encode pixels from more than one scan line. Even if the end of one scan line and the beginning of the next contain pixels of the same value, the two should be encoded as separate packets. In other words, Run-length Packets should not wrap from one line to another&quot;.

Consequently TGA readers need to be able to handle RLE data packets that cross scan lines since this was part of the original specification. However, when saving (creating) TGA files it will be necessary to limit RLE data packets to scanline boundaries in order to be compliant with the newer v2.0 TGA specification.

<doc id="270989" wikidata="Q4165249" url="?curid=270989" title="Sulaiman Abu Ghaith">
<text>Sulaiman Jassem Sulaiman Ali Abu Ghaith (; born 14 December 1965) is a Kuwaiti regarded as one of al-Qaeda&#x27;s spokesmen. He is married to one of Osama bin Laden&#x27;s daughters. In 2013, Gaith was arrested in Jordan and extradited to the United States. In 2014, he was convicted in a U.S. federal court in New York for &quot;conspiring to kill Americans and providing material support to terrorists&quot; and sentenced to life imprisonment He is serving his sentence at the federal ADX Florence prison in Colorado.

==Activities during the 1991 Gulf War==
Abu Ghaith, who grew up with the Muslim Brotherhood, first gained attention during the 1990–1991 Iraqi invasion and occupation of Kuwait. His sermons denouncing the occupation and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein gained him some degree of popularity amongst the Kuwaiti people. In 1992, he went to Bosnia and Herzegovina for nearly a month to do some &quot;relief services&quot; there. He later joined Muslim guerillas in the Bosnian War in summer 1994. The Kuwaiti government subsequently removed him from the mosque and banned him from giving sermons, as he used to criticize the Kuwaiti government and other Arab governments stridently, then he became a high school teacher of religion.

==Arrival in Afghanistan in June 2000==
In June 2000, he left Kuwait for Afghanistan, where he met Osama bin Laden and joined his al-Qaeda organization. His affinity for public speaking and comparative youth put him at the head of al-Qaeda&#x27;s attempt to widen its appeal from ultra-conservative and mostly elderly clerics to the general population and especially the youth of majority-Muslim countries; in this capacity, he quickly became the organization&#x27;s spokesman.

==Al Wafa==
According to documents in the unclassified dossier from Adel al Zamel&#x27;s Combatant Status Review Tribunal
Sulaiman Abu Ghaith was also a founder of Al Wafa al Igatha al Islamia, a charity the USA asserts provided a plausible front for al Qaeda&#x27;s fund-raising efforts.
One of the allegations against Al Zamil, who was also accused of being a founder of al Wafa, was that he helped Abu Ghaith&#x27;s family leave Afghanistan around the time of the attacks of 9–11.

==Al Qaeda video after 9/11==
He rose to worldwide attention following the 11 September 2001, attacks. On 10 October 2001, he appeared on two widely circulated videos (first broadcast on al Jazeera television) to defend the attacks and threaten reprisals for the subsequent US invasion of Afghanistan, saying, &quot;Americans should know, the storm of the planes will not stop... Thousands of the Islamic nation&#x27;s youths are eager to die just as the Americans are eager to live.&quot; These statements caused the Kuwaiti government to strip him of his citizenship.

In 2002, while living in Iran, he posted a statement that al Qaeda has &quot;the right to kill four million Americans, including one million children, displace double that figure, and injure and cripple hundreds and thousands.&quot;

==Alleged connection to the Faylaka Island attackers==
According to &quot;The Long War Journal&quot; American officials assert that Sulaiman Abu Ghaith attended al Qaeda&#x27;s airport training camp with Anas al Kandari and Faiz al Kandari. Anas al Kandari was a young Kuwaiti who fired upon a squad of marines, killing one, in the Faylaka Island attack in 2002. Faiz al Kandari is another Kuwaiti, who was held in extrajudicial detention in Guantanamo from 2002 to 2008. In 2008, charges were prepared against him to be referred to a Guantanamo military commission.
According to &quot;The Long War Journal&quot; in his book &quot;The Martyr&#x27;s Oath&quot;, Stewart Bell asserted Sulaiman Abu Ghaith recruited Anas al Kandari and the other shooter to launch the Faylaka Island attacks.

==Presence in Iran 2002–2013==
As he moved around to escape capture by the United States in the following months, his whereabouts are unclear. According to &quot;the Long War Journal&quot;, by 2002, Sulaiman was living in Iran.

In July 2003, a Kuwaiti minister announced that the Iranian government was holding Abu Ghaith and that Kuwait had refused an offer from Iran to extradite him to Kuwait.

In September 2010, the &quot;Long War Journal&quot; falsely reported that Abu Ghaith had been freed by Iran and had left the country for Afghanistan.

In March 2013, it was reported that Abu Ghaith had spent most of the last ten years in Iran, under house arrest.

==Presence in Turkey 2013 ==
In late January 2013, Abu Ghaith entered Turkey from Iran, staying in a hotel in Ankara. For a brief period, he was detained at the request of the United States but was released since he had committed no crime in Turkey. Turkish authorities held him as &quot;a guest&quot; since he did not have a passport at the time. Rather than extradite him to the United States, the Turkish authorities decided to deport him to his home country, Kuwait.

==Arrest, extradition to the United States, and trial==
On a stopover in Amman, Jordan, Abu Ghaith was arrested by Jordanian officials and turned over to US authorities on 7 March 2013. He was subsequently extradited to the United States and housed in a federal prison in New York.

Abu Ghaith was indicted on charges of conspiring to kill Americans and tried in the Federal District Court in Manhattan (&quot;U.S. v. Abu Ghayth&quot;, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 98-cr-01023). He pleaded not guilty on 8 March 2013.

On 8 April 2013, Abu Ghaith&#x27;s attorneys were considering a request for change of venue, since New York City received the greatest loss from the attacks on 11 September 2001. Abu Ghaith&#x27;s lawyers sought the right to call upon Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as a witness. On 18 March 2014, this request was denied by a New York federal judge.

On 26 March 2014, Abu Ghaith was convicted of &quot;conspiring to kill Americans and providing material support to terrorists&quot; and he was subsequently sentenced to life in prison by U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan.

On 28 September 2017, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan upheld his conviction.

==Personal life==
He married his first wife, Fatima, in Kuwait, with whom he had six daughters and a son. He then married an Egyptian woman named Amal, who was detained with him in Iran, with whom he had two daughters; then he married Osama bin Laden&#x27;s daughter, Fatima, with whom he had a daughter and a son.

<text>In biochemistry, the DNA methyltransferase (DNA MTase, DNMT) family of enzymes catalyze the transfer of a methyl group to DNA. DNA methylation serves a wide variety of biological functions. All the known DNA methyltransferases use S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor.

== Classification ==

=== Substrate ===
MTases can be divided into three different groups on the basis of the chemical reactions they catalyze:
* m6A - those that generate N6-methyladenine 
* m4C - those that generate N4-methylcytosine 
* m5C - those that generate C5-methylcytosine 

m6A and m4C methyltransferases are found primarily in prokaryotes (although recent evidence has suggested that m6A is abundant in eukaryotes). m5C methyltransferases are found in some lower eukaryotes, in most higher plants, and in animals beginning with the echinoderms.

The m6A methyltransferases (N-6 adenine-specific DNA methylase) (A-Mtase) are enzymes that specifically methylate the amino group at the C-6 position of adenines in DNA. They are found in the three existing types of bacterial restriction-modification systems (in type I system the A-Mtase is the product of the hsdM gene, and in type III it is the product of the mod gene). These enzymes are responsible for the methylation of specific DNA sequences in order to prevent the host from digesting its own genome via its restriction enzymes. These methylases have the same sequence specificity as their corresponding restriction enzymes. These enzymes contain a conserved motif Asp/Asn-Pro-Pro-Tyr/Phe in their N-terminal section, this conserved region could be involved in substrate binding or in the catalytic activity. The structure of N6-MTase TaqI (M.TaqI) has been resolved to 2.4 A. The molecule folds into 2 domains, an N-terminal catalytic domain, which contains the catalytic and cofactor binding sites, and comprises a central 9-stranded beta-sheet, surrounded by 5 helices; and a C-terminal DNA recognition domain, which is formed by 4 small beta-sheets and 8 alpha-helices. The N- and C-terminal domains form a cleft that accommodates the DNA substrate. A classification of N-MTases has been proposed, based on conserved motif (CM) arrangements. According to this classification, N6-MTases that have a DPPY motif (CM II) occurring after the FxGxG motif (CM I) are designated D12 class N6-adenine MTases. The type I restriction and modification system is composed of three polypeptides R, M and S. The M (hsdM) and S subunits together form a methyltransferase that methylates two adenine residues in complementary strands of a bipartite DNA recognition sequence. In the presence of the R subunit, the complex can also act as an endonuclease, binding to the same target sequence but cutting the DNA some distance from this site. Whether the DNA is cut or modified depends on the methylation state of the target sequence. When the target site is unmodified, the DNA is cut. When the target site is hemimethylated, the complex acts as a maintenance methyltransferase, modifying the DNA so that both strands become methylated. hsdM contains an alpha-helical domain at the N-terminus, the HsdM N-terminal domain.

Among the m6A methyltransferases (N-6 adenine-specific DNA methylase) there is a group of orphan MTases that do not participate in the bacterial restriction/methylation system. These enzymes have a regulatory role in gene expression and cell cycle regulation. EcoDam from &quot;E. coli&quot; and CcrM from &quot;Caulobacter crescentus&quot; are well characterized members of these family. More recently, CamA from &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;, was shown to play key functional roles in sporulation, biofilm formations and host-adaptation.

m4C methyltransferases (N-4 cytosine-specific DNA methylases) are enzymes that specifically methylate the amino group at the C-4 position of cytosines in DNA. Such enzymes are found as components of type II restriction-modification systems in prokaryotes. Such enzymes recognise a specific sequence in DNA and methylate a cytosine in that sequence. By this action they protect DNA from cleavage by type II restriction enzymes that recognise the same sequence

m5C methyltransferases (C-5 cytosine-specific DNA methylase) (C5 Mtase) are enzymes that specifically methylate the C-5 carbon of cytosines in DNA to produce C5-methylcytosine. In mammalian cells, cytosine-specific methyltransferases methylate certain CpG sequences, which are believed to modulate gene expression and cell differentiation. In bacteria, these enzymes are a component of restriction-modification systems and serve as valuable tools for the manipulation of DNA. The structure of HhaI methyltransferase (M.HhaI) has been resolved to 2.5 A: the molecule folds into 2 domains - a larger catalytic domain containing catalytic and cofactor binding sites, and a smaller DNA recognition domain.

Highly conserved DNA methyltransferases of the m4C, m5C, and m6A types have been reported, which appear as promising targets for the development of novel epigenetic inhibitors to fight bacterial virulence, antibiotic resistance, among other biomedical applications.

=== De novo vs. maintenance ===

&quot;De novo&quot; methyltransferases recognize something in the DNA that allows them to newly methylate cytosines. These are expressed mainly in early embryo development and they set up the pattern of methylation. &quot;De novo&quot; methyltransferases are also active when a signal-responsive cell, such as a neuron, needs to alter protein expression. As an example, when fear conditioning creates a new memory in a rat, 9.17% of the genes in the rat hippocampus neuron genome are differentially methylated.

&quot;Maintenance methyltransferases&quot; add methylation to DNA when one strand is already methylated. These work throughout the life of the organism to maintain the methylation pattern that had been established by the de novo methyltransferases.

== Mammalian ==

At least four differently active DNA methyltransferases have been identified in mammals. They are named DNMT1, two isoforms transcribed from the &quot;DNMT3a&quot; gene: DNMT3a1 and DNMT3a2, and DNMT3b. Recently, another enzyme DNMT3c has been discovered specifically expressed in the male germline in the mouse.


Manzo et al. observed differences in genomic binding of DNMT3a1, DNMT3a2 and DNMT3b. They found 3,970 regions exclusively enriched for DNMT3a1, 3,838 exclusively enriched for DNMT3a2 and 3,432 exclusively enriched for DNMT3b.

The DNMT enzymes are not only regulated in their methylating locations on the genome by where they bind to DNA, but they are also regulated by the post-translational modifications on the histone proteins of the nucleosomes around which the genomic DNA is wrapped (see Figures). Rose and Klose reviewed the relationship between DNA methylation and histone lysine methylation. For example, they indicated that H3K4me3 appears to block DNA methylation while H3K9me3 plays a role in promoting DNA methylation.

DNMT3L is a protein closely related to DNMT3a and DNMT3b in structure and critical for DNA methylation, but appears to be inactive on its own.

=== DNMT1 ===

DNMT1 is the most abundant DNA methyltransferase in mammalian cells, and considered to be the key maintenance methyltransferase in mammals. It predominantly methylates hemimethylated CpG di-nucleotides in the mammalian genome. The recognition motif for the human enzyme involves only three of the bases in the CpG dinucleotide pair: a C on one strand and CpG on the other. This relaxed substrate specificity requirement allows it to methylate unusual structures like DNA slippage intermediates at de novo rates that equal its maintenance rate. Like other DNA cytosine-5 methyltransferases the human enzyme recognizes flipped out cytosines in double stranded DNA and operates by the nucleophilic attack mechanism. In human cancer cells DNMT1 is responsible for both &quot;de novo&quot; and maintenance methylation of tumor suppressor genes. The enzyme is about 1,620 amino acids long. The first 1,100 amino acids constitute the regulatory domain of the enzyme, and the remaining residues constitute the catalytic domain. These are joined by Gly-Lys repeats. Both domains are required for the catalytic function of DNMT1.

DNMT1 has several isoforms, the somatic DNMT1, a splice variant (DNMT1b) and an oocyte-specific isoform (DNMT1o). DNMT1o is synthesized and stored in the cytoplasm of the oocyte and translocated to the cell nucleus during early embryonic development, while the somatic DNMT1 is always found in the nucleus of somatic tissue.

DNMT1 null mutant embryonic stem cells were viable and contained a small percentage of methylated DNA and methyltransferase activity. Mouse embryos homozygous for a deletion in Dnmt1 die at 10–11 days gestation.

=== TRDMT1 ===
Although this enzyme has strong sequence similarities with 5-methylcytosine methyltransferases of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, in 2006, the enzyme was shown to methylate position 38 in aspartic acid transfer RNA and does not methylate DNA. The name for this methyltransferase has been changed from DNMT2 to TRDMT1 (tRNA aspartic acid methyltransferase 1) to better reflect its biological function. TRDMT1 is the first RNA cytosine methyltransferase to be identified in human cells.

=== DNMT3 ===
DNMT3 is a family of DNA methyltransferases that could methylate hemimethylated and unmethylated CpG at the same rate. The architecture of DNMT3 enzymes is similar to that of DNMT1, with a regulatory region attached to a catalytic domain. There are at least five members of the DNMT3 family: DNMT3a1, DNMT3a2, 3b, 3c and 3L.

DNMT3a1, DNMT3a2 and DNMT3b can mediate methylation of CpG sites in gene promoters, resulting in gene repression. These DNA methyltransferases can also methylate CpG sites within the coding regions of genes, where such methylation can increase gene transcription. Work with DNMT3a1 showed it preferentially localized to CpG islands bivalently marked by H3K4me3 (a transcription promoting mark) and H3K27me3 (a transcription repressive mark), coinciding with the promoters of many transcription factors. Work with DNMT3a2, in neurons, found that the DNA methylation changes caused by DNMT3a2 predominantly occur in intergenic and intronic regions. These intergenic and intronic DNA methylations were thought to likely regulate enhancer activity, alternative splicing or the expression of non-coding RNAs.

DNMT3a1 can co-localize with heterochromatin protein (HP1) and methyl-CpG-binding protein (MeCBP), among a number of other factors. They can also interact with DNMT1, which might be a co-operative event during DNA methylation. DNMT3a prefers CpG methylation to CpA, CpT, and CpC methylation, though there appears to be some sequence preference of methylation for DNMT3a and DNMT3b. DNMT3a methylates CpG sites at a rate much slower than DNMT1, but greater than DNMT3b.

The expression of DNMT3a2 differs from DNMT3a1 and DNMT3b because DNMT3a2 expression occurs in the pattern of an immediate early gene. DNMT3a2 is induced to express in neurons, for instance, by new neuronal activity. This may be of importance in establishing long-term memory. In a rat, high levels of new DNA methylations in neurons of the hippocampus occur after a memorable event is imposed on a rat, such as contextual fear conditioning. Bayraktar and Kreutz found that DNMT inhibitors, applied in the brain, prevented long-term memories from forming.

DNMT3L contains DNA methyltransferase motifs and is required for establishing maternal genomic imprints, despite being catalytically inactive. DNMT3L is expressed during gametogenesis when genomic imprinting takes place. The loss of DNMT3L leads to bi-allelic expression of genes normally not expressed by the maternal allele. DNMT3L interacts with DNMT3a and DNMT3b and co-localized in the nucleus. Though DNMT3L appears incapable of methylation, it may participate in transcriptional repression.

== Clinical significance ==
===DNMT inhibitors===

Because of the epigenetic effects of the DNMT family, some DNMT inhibitors are under investigation for treatment of some cancers:
* Vidaza (azacitidine) in phase III trials for myelodysplastic syndromes and AML
* Dacogen (decitabine) in phase III trials for AML and CML. EU approved in 2012 for AML.
* guadecitabine, an experimental drug under development by Astex Pharmaceuticals and Otsuka Pharmaceutical. It failed to meet primary endpoints in a 2018 Phase III AML trial.

<text>A citizen&#x27;s arrest is an arrest made by a private citizen – a person who is not acting as a sworn law-enforcement official. In common law jurisdictions, the practice dates back to medieval England and the English common law, in which sheriffs encouraged ordinary citizens to help apprehend law breakers.

Despite the practice&#x27;s name, in most countries the arresting person is usually designated as a &quot;person&quot; with arrest powers, who need not be a &quot;citizen&quot; of the country in which they are acting. For example, in England and Wales, the power comes from Section 24A(2) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, called &quot;any person arrest&quot;. This legislation states &quot;any person&quot; has these powers, with no requirement for the person making the arrest to hold British citizenship.

==Legal and political aspects==
Anyone who makes a citizen&#x27;s arrest can find themselves facing possible lawsuits or criminal charges (e.g. charges of false imprisonment, unlawful restraint, kidnapping, or wrongful arrest) if the wrong person is apprehended or a suspect&#x27;s civil rights are violated. This is especially true when police forces are attempting to determine who an aggressor is. Private citizens do not enjoy the same immunity from civil liability when making arrests on other private citizens as police officers do.

The level of responsibility that a person performing a citizen&#x27;s arrest may bear depends on the jurisdiction. For instance, in France and Germany, a person stopping a criminal from committing a crime, including crimes against belongings, is not criminally responsible as long as the means employed are in proportion to the threat. In both countries, this results from a different legal norm, &quot;aid to others in immediate danger&quot;, which is concerned with prevention, not prosecution, of crimes.

==Laws by country==

===Australia===

In Australia, the power to arrest is granted by both federal and state legislation; however, the exact power granted differs depending on jurisdiction. The power to arrest for a federal offence is granted by section 3Z of the &quot;Crimes Act 1914&quot;. Under the Act, a person who is not a police constable may, without warrant, arrest another person if they believe on reasonable grounds that:
* the other person is committing or has just committed an indictable offence; and
* proceedings by summons against the other person would not: ensure the appearance of the person before a court in respect of the offence; prevent a repetition or continuation of the offence or the commission of another offence; prevent the concealment, loss or destruction of evidence relating to the offence; prevent harassment of, or interference with, a person who may be required to give evidence in proceedings in respect of the offence; prevent the fabrication of evidence in respect of the offence; or would not preserve the safety or welfare of the person.

A person who arrests another person must, as soon as practicable after the arrest, arrange for the other person, and any property found on the other person, to be delivered into the custody of a constable.

Generally speaking, as regards the law in Australia: Where it is clear on the evidence that a private citizen, or security officer, in detaining a suspect, acted reasonably and the suspect unreasonably, then it is likely that the court will find in favour of the citizen or security officer and against the suspect if that suspect chooses, later, to sue the citizen for assault or false imprisonment. In other circumstances where, e.g. a property owner (or an agent) arrests a thief in a manner, and in circumstances, disproportionate to the likely harm to the victim, and in clear defiance of the rights of the suspect (for example, to be taken forthwith to a police station), then the court is very likely to find in favour of the suspect (guilty or otherwise). The courts may order compensation for such suspects in appropriate circumstances.

====New South Wales====

In the Australian state of New South Wales, the power to arrest is granted to anyone who is not a police officer by section 100 of the &quot;Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002&quot; (NSW). Under the Act, a person may, without a warrant, arrest another person if:
* the person is in the act of committing an offence under any Act or statutory instrument, or
* the person has just committed any such offence, or
* the person has committed a serious indictable offence for which the person has not been tried.

Section 231 of the Act allows the use of such force as is &quot;reasonably necessary to make the arrest or to prevent the escape of the person after arrest&quot;. A person who arrests another person under section 100 must, as soon as is reasonably practicable, take the person, and any property found on the person, before a magistrate to be dealt with according to law. The magistrate will also decide whether or not the force applied in making the arrest was reasonable under the circumstances.

According to the Law Society of New South Wales, the arresting person should:
* inform the person that they are under arrest and
* inform the person of the reasons for the arrest.

====Queensland====

In the Australian state of Queensland, the power to arrest is granted by section 546 of Schedule 1 to the &quot;Criminal Code Act 1899&quot; (Qld). Under the Act, any person who finds another committing an offence may, without warrant, arrest the other person. The power to arrest in Queensland also allows for arrest on suspicion of an offence:
Section 260 of the Act also provides a power to arrest in preventing a breach of the peace:
Following the arrest, the person arrested must, without delay, be handed over to a justice of the peace or police officer, in accordance with section 552 of the Criminal Code. Legal advice should then be sought to avoid any possible legal action for wrongful arrest, false imprisonment or assault.

====South Australia====

Section 271 of the &quot;Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935&quot; (SA) grants arrest powers to a person in South Australia.

====Tasmania====

Under the &quot;Police Offences Act 1935&quot; (Tas), section 55(3), any person may arrest any other person whom they find committing an offence, where they have reasonable grounds to believe that the conduct will create or may involve substantial injury to another person, serious danger of such injury, loss of property or serious injury to property. Section 55(5) states &quot;For the purposes of this section, a person is said to be &#x27;found offending&#x27; if he does any act, or makes any omission, or conducts or behaves himself, and thereby causes a person who finds him reasonable grounds for believing that he has, in respect of such act, omission, or conduct, committed an offence against this Act.&quot; There are further provisions in section 301 of the &quot;Criminal Code Act 1924&quot; (Tas) that appear to allow a sliding scale of force in executing an arrest.

====Victoria====

In the Australian state of Victoria, the power to arrest is granted in section 458 of the &quot;Crimes Act 1958&quot; (Vic). It states that a person may, without a warrant, arrest a person that they find committing an offence for one or more of the following reasons:
* to ensure the appearance of the offender in court, and/or
* to preserve public order, and/or
* to prevent the continuation or repetition of the offence, or the commission of a further offence, and/or
* for the safety or welfare of the public or the offender.

A person may also arrest another person if they are instructed to do so by a member of the police force, or if they believe on reasonable grounds that the offender is escaping legal custody.

Section 461 states that if an arrest is made under section 458 of the &quot;Crimes Act&quot;, and is later proven to be false, then the arrest itself will not be considered unlawful if it was made on reasonable grounds. Section 462A allows any person the right to use force &quot;not disproportionate to the objective as he believes on reasonable grounds to be necessary to prevent the commission, continuance or completion of an indictable offence or to effect or assist in effecting the lawful arrest of a person committing or suspected of committing any offence&quot;.

====Western Australia====

It was only in 2004 that the Western Australian parliament repealed the provisions of the former section 47 of the &quot;Police Act 1892&quot; which allowed any person to arrest without a warrant &quot;any reputed common prostitute, thief, loose, idle or disorderly person, who, within view of such person apprehending, shall offend against this Act, and shall forthwith deliver him to any constable or police officer of the place where he shall have been apprehended, to be taken and conveyed before a Justice, to be dealt with according to law ...&quot; A private citizen would have found it rather difficult to interpret the terms &quot;loose&quot; or &quot;idle&quot; with any degree of legal certainty. Citizen&#x27;s arrest powers are now in section 25 of the &quot;Criminal Investigation Act 2006&quot; (WA).

====The Territories====

;Northern Territory
:Under section 441(2) of the Criminal Code of the Northern Territory, any person can arrest another whom (s)he finds committing an offence or behaving such that he or she believes on reasonable grounds that the offender has committed an offence and that an arrest is necessary for a range of specified reasons.

;Australian Capital Territory
: See the &quot;Crimes Act 1900&quot; (ACT), section 218, which permits a citizen&#x27;s arrest.

===Austria===
In Austria, citizen&#x27;s arrests (&quot;&quot;) can be made under § 80 Abs 2 StPO (code of penal procedures). The person making the arrest is allowed to hold the arrestee solely for the purpose of turning him over to a proper legal authority such as the police.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, a Federal law allows any person to arrest a suspect criminal found in flagrante delicto or fleeing from the crime scene. The person has to, at his/her own judgment, have the physical power to keep the suspect detained, has to verbally explain what (s)he is doing to the arrestee and has to call the police. Both have to wait for the arrival of the police. The person who makes a citizen&#x27;s arrest has to sign the police forms as a witness and explain the facts. Typically it will lead to a time burden of at least two hours. If the facts cannot be verified the person who realizes the citizen&#x27;s arrest might be sued by the arrestee.

===Canada===

====Federal law====
Canada&#x27;s blanket arrest authorities for crimes or violations of federal statutes are found in the Criminal Code. In Canada, a criminal offence is any offence that is created by a federal statute—there are no &quot;provincial crimes&quot;.

Criminal offences are divided into three groups: indictable, dual procedure, and summary conviction. For the purposes of arrest, dual procedure offences are considered to be indictable.

The Criminal Code provisions related to citizen arrests were changed in 2012, by the Citizen&#x27;s Arrest and Self-defence Act. As a consequence, it is now possible to make a citizen&#x27;s arrest in Canada in circumstances where a &quot;reasonable&quot; amount of time has lapsed between the commission of a property-related offence and the arrest.

====Provincial law====
There are several arrest authorities found through the various provincial statutes. The most notable citizen&#x27;s arrest authority in Ontario is found in the Trespass to Property Act, but there are others found in the Highway Traffic Act, the Liquor Licence Act, and many others.

===China===
Chinese criminal procedure law empowers &quot;any citizen&quot; to make citizen&#x27;s arrest:

===Czech Republic===
In the Czech Republic, pursuant to § 76 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (&quot;Zákon č. 141/1961 Sb. o trestním řízení soudním (trestní řád)&quot;), the personal liberty of a person caught in the act of committing a crime or immediately afterwards may be restricted by anyone if necessary to establish the person&#x27;s identity, prevent their escape or secure evidence. The arrester shall, however, be obliged to hand that person over immediately to the police authority; The arrester may also hand over a member of the armed forces to the nearest armed forces unit or garrison administrator. If such a person cannot be handed over immediately, the restriction of that person&#x27;s personal liberty shall be notified without delay to one of those authorities.

===Denmark===
In Denmark, pursuant to § 755 (2) of the Administration of Justice Act, anyone may arrest a person caught in the act of committing a crime or in direct connection to a crime if the criminal act is subject to public prosecution. The arrestee must as soon as possible be turned over to the police with information about the time of and reasons for the arrest.

===Ethiopia===
In Ethiopia, any private person may arrest without warrant a person who has committed a flagrant offence as defined in Art. 19 and 20 of the Criminal Procedure Code where the offence is punishable with simple imprisonment for not less than
three months. In addition where the police call for assistance in making an arrest with or without warrant there shall be a duty to assist where assistance can be given without risk. The Criminal Procedure Code also provides that where an arrest is made the person making the arrest shall without unnecessary delay hand over the person so arrested to the nearest police
station.

===Finland===
In Finland, Coercive Measures Act 22.7.2011/806 gives a right to apprehend someone in the act of committing a crime &quot;(in flagrante delicto)&quot; or fleeing from the crime scene, if punishment for the crime might be imprisonment or the crime is petty assault, petty theft, petty embezzlement, petty unauthorized use, petty stealing of a motor vehicle for temporary use, petty damage to property or petty fraud. A person wanted by the police (arrest warrant) can be apprehended by anyone. After the apprehension, the detainee must be handed over to the police as soon as possible. If the criminal is resisting or tries to escape, the law gives a citizen the right to use an amount of force considered necessary, when considering the nature of the crime, the behavior of the apprehended and the situation as a whole.

===France===
French law allows any civilian to arrest a person caught &quot;in flagrante delicto&quot; committing a felony or misdemeanor punishable by a jail sentence, with the obligation to immediately bring that person before the nearest officer of the police judiciaire. In modern practice, one would detain the perpetrator and immediately call the nearest police, then hand over the perpetrator and any evidence to the first police officers to arrive at the scene. Use of force is not authorised.

===Georgia===
Article 29 of the Georgian Penal Code provides that &quot;A person shall not be considered to have acted unlawfully if he/she seizes the offender to bring him/her before public authorities without exceeding the measures required for this purpose. Exceeding the measures required for seizing an offender shall mean clear incompatibility of this measure with the gravity of the crime committed by the person to be seized and the circumstances relating to seizure.&quot;

===Germany===
Citizen&#x27;s arrests (in German: &quot;Jedermann-Anhalte- und -Festnahmerecht&quot;) can be made under § 127 I 1 StPO (code of penal procedures) if the arrestee is caught &quot;in flagrante delicto&quot; and either the identity of the person cannot be otherwise established immediately or they are suspected to try to flee. The person making the arrest is allowed to hold the arrestee solely for the purpose of turning them over to a proper legal authority such as the police. German law does not establish that the crime has to be serious, nor that the person making the arrest has to actually be a citizen of Germany.
The use of force is authorized, but the force must be proportional (&quot;verhältnismäßig&quot;) to the circumstances and the suspected crime.

===Hong Kong===

Citizen&#x27;s arrest is known as the &quot;101 power&quot;. Under the Criminal Procedure Ordinance (cap. 221 of the Laws of Hong Kong), section 101(2) provides that &quot;Any person may arrest without warrant any person whom he may reasonably suspect of being guilty of an arrestable offence&quot; using &quot;force as is reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances&quot;. Once an arrest is made, the suspect must be delivered to a police office as soon as possible for court proceedings. &quot;Arrestable offence&quot; is defined as any crimes that can be sentenced for more than 12 months of jail time.

===Hungary===
According to article 273 of &quot;Act XC. of 2017 concerning Penal Procedure&quot;, anyone may arrest a person caught committing a felony, but is obliged to hand the person over to the &quot;investigative authorities&quot; immediately; if this is not possible, the police must be informed.

===India===
Section 40, of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita states that:

According to this section any private person may arrest or cause to be arrested
===Iran===
The Code of Criminal Procedure allows private citizens to detain those suspected of crimes in order to prevent their escape, so long as the crime in question is on the list of crimes subjected to citizens&#x27; arrest, the crime is evident, and law enforcement is absent from the scene.

===Ireland===
The term &quot;citizen&#x27;s arrest&quot; is colloquially used for arrest, without an arrest warrant, made by someone other than a member of the Garda Síochána. Despite the colloquial name, non-Irish citizens have performed such arrests. The law of the Republic of Ireland, being derived from English law, inherited the common law power for private individuals to arrest for felony or breach of the peace. The Criminal Law Act 1997 abolished the common-law distinction between felonies and misdemeanours and instead distinguishes &quot;arrestable&quot; and &quot;non-arrestable&quot; offences; arrestable offences are those punishable by at least five years&#x27; imprisonment, and private individuals may arrest those &quot;in flagrante&quot;, having committed, or about to commit an arrestable offence.

Several other statutes which define offences likewise state &quot;any person may arrest&quot; someone committing the offence; relevant offences include
making off without payment,
hawking revenue stamps,
and property damage — this last permits arrest for a past crime as well as one in progress.
In addition, the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act 1976 schedules offences associated with the Troubles in Northern Ireland, and authorises anyone to arrest someone for committing or having committed such an offence, whether in the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland. The 1976 act, and a similar Westminster act giving reciprocal extraterritorial jurisdiction, obviated the need for extradition between the jurisdictions, which would have been more controversial.

If the arrester lacks reasonable cause to believe the arrested person to have committed the offence, the latter may sue the former for defamation, wrongful arrest, or trespass. For most offences, a private individual can only make such an arrest if the suspect would otherwise evade arrest by a Garda, and the arrester must surrender the suspect to Garda custody as soon as practicable. An exception is that stamp hawkers must be brought before the District Court. Citizen&#x27;s arrests are rare; most often they are made by store detectives on shoplifting suspects.

===Israel===

An Israeli law allowing anyone to arrest a suspect whom they witnessed carrying out a felony was repealed in 1996 and replaced by a new law allowing the detention of a suspect by another person under certain conditions. Section 75 of the Criminal Procedure Law (Enforcement Powers – Arrest) of 1996 allows anyone to detain a person who is witnessed carrying out certain suspected crimes. The crimes include the following: a felony, theft, a crime of violence and a crime which has caused serious damage to property. A person using these detention powers may use reasonable force if their request is not met as long as they do not cause the suspect bruising. They must hand the suspect over to the police immediately and no later than three hours. A citizen&#x27;s arrest cannot be performed on persons whose identity is known or who are not suspected of fleeing. The law can be used by both private individuals and private security.

=== Italy ===
Any private citizen can, according to article 383 of the Italian Code of Criminal Procedure, arrest another person, provided they are caught &quot;&quot;in flagranza di reato&quot; (In flagrante delicto) and the felony they are caught committing includes mandatory arrest from the police and is &quot;perseguibile d&#x27;ufficio&quot;, meaning that the judicial authority, once received the &quot;notitia criminis&quot;&quot; (a crime report), has the duty to commence prosecution, without a party necessarily filing a complaint. The person making the arrest is legally required to hand to police the arrested person and the corpus delicti to the judicial authority, failure to do so could result in the person making the arrest committing a crime.

===Japan===
In Japan, Section 213 of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows anyone from civilians to firefighters witnessing any crime in progress to make an arrest. This is called &quot;genkouhan&quot; (現行犯, meaning &quot;in flagrante delicto&quot;). Most criminals who attempt to flee, or refuse to identify themselves, can be held until police arrive. However, making a citizen&#x27;s arrest to prevent petty crime (e.g. illegal assembly, accidental injury, accidental trespass, defamation of character, leaving a parking lot without paying) is false imprisonment per Section 220 of the Criminal Code.

===Latvia===
Criminal Procedure Law in Latvia gives a right to any person to apprehend someone in the act of committing a crime &quot;(in flagrante delicto)&quot; or fleeing from the crime scene, if punishment for the crime might be imprisonment. Also a person wanted by the police, for whom there is an arrest warrant, can be arrested by anyone at any time. A person stopping a criminal from committing a crime is not criminally responsible as long as the means employed are in proportion to the threat. The arrested person must be handed over to the police immediately.

===Malaysia===
Section 27(1) of the &quot;Criminal Procedure Code&quot; allows for a private person to arrest a person who, in his view, has committed a seizable offence or a non-bailable offence:

Sub-section 5 further allows the arrest of a person who commits an offence on or with respect to the property of another by any person who is using the property to which the injury is done, or by the servant of either of those persons or by any person authorized by or acting in aid of either of those persons:

A &quot;seizable offence&quot; is defined as an offence in which a police officer may ordinarily arrest without warrant as per defined by the Code.

===Mexico===
Article 16 of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico allows any person to arrest a criminal found &quot;in flagrante delicto&quot;. A non-police officer doing so must immediately bring them to the nearest civil authority. A person who fails to do so may be found guilty of illegal deprivation of liberty, a crime similar to kidnapping that can result in a prison sentence for the perpetrator. In 2006, the celebrity bounty hunter Duane &#x27;Dog&#x27; Chapman was charged with unlawful deprivation of liberty for arresting an American fugitive in Mexico and attempting to take him across the border to California without consulting police.

===Nepal===
Section 9(8) of The National Criminal Procedure (Code) Act, 2017 states :
&quot;If the police is not available for the time being at the time of commission of any offence, any person who is present at the time of commission of that offence or who is eye witness thereto may prevent the person committing such offence from going away or escaping and hand him or her over to the nearby police office.&quot;

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, some legal protection exists to those making a citizen&#x27;s arrest as provided in the Crimes Act 1961 in that there may be justification or protection from criminal responsibility. Justification of the arrest ensures the arresting person is not guilty of an offence and is not liable to any civil proceeding. Protection from criminal responsibility means those who make the arrest are not liable to any criminal proceedings. They are however liable for civil proceedings. The legislation is carefully worded and only applies to offences covered in the Crimes Act 1961, not other offences such as those covered in the Summary Offences Act 1981.

Specifically, the Crimes Act 1961 states that everyone (not just New Zealand citizens) is justified in arresting without warrant:
* Any person found committing any offence against this Act which the maximum punishment is not less than 3 years&#x27; imprisonment; or
* Any person found at night (9pm till 6am) committing any offence against this Act.

Other situations where members of the public are protected from criminal responsibility when involved in arresting where:
* They have been asked by a police officer to help arrest any person believed or suspected to have committed any offence unless they know that there is no reasonable ground for the belief or suspicion.
* They witness a breach of the peace, and therefore are justified in interfering to prevent its continuance or renewal, and may detain any person committing it, in order to hand them over to a police officer provided that the person interfering does not use more force than is reasonably necessary to prevent the continuance or renewal of the breach of the peace, or than is reasonably proportionate to the danger to be apprehended from its continuance or renewal. Similar legislation applies to suppressions of riots by members of the public.
* They believe, on reasonable and probable grounds, someone has committed an offence against the Crimes Act 1961 and is fleeing and is being pursued by any one they believe can arrest that person for the offence (such as a police officer). This applies whether or not the offence has in fact been committed, and whether or not the arrested person committed it.
* The person making the arrest is entitled to perform a search on the suspect, provided (s)he is not working for the place of arrest (e.g. a security guard in a hospital).

In all cases a person making a citizens arrest must hand over the suspect to a police officer at the earliest possible time.

===Nigeria===
The Administration of Criminal Justice Act (2015) allows private citizens to arrest a person who commits a criminal offense in their presence or a person who they reasonably suspect of having committed a crime for which a police officer would be legally entitled to arrest them without a warrant. Property owners are entitled to arrest those found damaging their private property and to authorize people working for them to arrest anyone damaging their property as well. Anyone damaging public property may be arrested by a private citizen. Private citizens who make arrests are legally obligated to immediately hand over the suspect to a police officer, or, in the absence of a police officer, to turn the suspect over to the nearest police station. After turning in the suspect, the private person who made the arrest must give a formal witness statement on the circumstances of the arrest.

===Norway===
In Norway, pursuant to § 176 of the Criminal Procedure Act any person may arrest a suspect caught at the scene or pursued from it. The arrestee must be handed over to the police immediately.

===Peru===
The Code of Criminal Procedure allows private citizens to arrest persons caught &quot;in flagrante delicto&quot; in the commission of a crime. Private citizens who make an arrest are obligated to immediately turn over the detainee to the police.

===Philippines===
Although the Philippines does not have a national law covering citizen&#x27;s arrest, the local government of Quezon City passed &quot;Ordinance 2307&quot; or the &quot;Citizen&#x27;s Arrest Ordinance of Quezon City&quot;. Any citizens within the Quezon City area can arrest a person even without a warrant in the instances mentioned and provided by law.

===Poland===
In Poland anyone has the right to apprehend a person caught in the act of committing an offence, or seized in a pursuit undertaken directly following the commission of an offence, if it is feared that such person may go into hiding or if his identity cannot be established. The apprehended person should be surrendered to the police without delay.

===Portugal===

In Portugal one is not civilly liable for restraining another person as long as one has used proportional force in order to defend themselves or someone else or anyone&#x27;s property, under Articles 336, 337 and 339 of the Portuguese Civil Code (self defense, necessity and alike), and as long as there is an impossibility to resort to law enforcement. The main requirement of proportionality is that one does not give way to property rights over personal rights, the latter prevailing at all costs. There is also an exception to the proportionality principle which applies when, even though the defensive violence was excessive, it was triggered by a legitimate fear of the offended.

With regards to the criminal aspects of the citizen&#x27;s arrest, Article 255 of the Portuguese Code of Criminal Procedure gives any person the right to detain another in flagrante delicto if and only if the latter&#x27;s conduct in question is punishable with imprisonment by law and the criminal procedure does not require private complaint, and no law enforcement authority is available in due time. The arrester must immediately bring the detainee into the custody of law enforcement.

=== Russia ===
In Russia, any person is allowed to arrest someone in the act of committing a crime pursuant to articles 37 and 38 of the Criminal Code of Russia and the Ruling of the Plenum of the Supreme Court of Russia of 27 September 2012 if the person performing the arrest is certain that the arrestee has committed a crime. The arrest must be carried out with applying as little force as required for the apprehension and the arrestee should be surrendered to the police without delay.

===Serbia===
In Serbia anybody can arrest somebody in the act of committing a crime that the arrested would otherwise be pursued after in official capacity, provided that the police are notified.

===Singapore===
Under section 66(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, a citizen&#x27;s arrest may be performed under two conditions: that the offense must have been committed in the view or presence of the individual making the arrest, and that the offense must be an arrestable and non-bailable offense (an offense for which a police officer may make an arrest without a warrant). Additionally, a citizen&#x27;s arrest may be performed even for an arrestable and non-bailable offense against anyone who commits an offense against the individual making the arrest or their property, provided that the name and residential address of the offender are not known. Anyone who performs a citizen&#x27;s arrest must hand over the arrested person to the police without delay.

=== Spain ===
In Spain, any person is allowed to arrest someone in the act of committing a crime or a fugitive as described in article 490 of the Criminal Procedure Law, and must be delivered to a judge within 24 hours (article 496).

===Sweden===
In Sweden, any person may arrest someone in the act of committing a crime, or fleeing from the crime scene, if the crime committed is punishable by imprisonment. A person wanted by the police, for whom there is an arrest warrant, can be arrested by anyone at any time. After the arrest, the police must be contacted as soon as possible.

Security guards and others working with preventing crime but are not police officers, have this law as justification to arrest thieves and other they encounter.

===Switzerland===
According to the Swiss Criminal Procedure Code § 218, citizens have the right to arrest a person when there is insufficient time to obtain police assistance, provided that
When making an arrest, private individuals may only use force as a last resort and any force used must be reasonable. Arrested persons must be handed over to the police as quickly as possible.

===Taiwan===
An arrest without a warrant is explicitly forbidden by the Article 8 in the Constitution of the Republic of China, &quot;except in case of flagrante delicto as provided by law&quot;, as shown below:

However, the first additional circumstance, i.e. &quot;pursued with cries&quot; has been considered ambiguous in recent years, leading to many ongoing discussions and controversies of whether this would cause an infringement of the personal freedom.

===Turkey===

Turkish Criminal Procedure Code states:

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
A citizen&#x27;s arrest can be lawfully carried out on any person under section 24A of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 for an indictable offence, including either way offences (in this section referred to simply as &quot;an offence&quot;), but with some exceptions listed below.

A few examples of indictable and either way offences are theft, criminal damage, burglary, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, possession of an offensive weapon in a public place, possession of a controlled substance. Further examples of either-way offences are listed under Schedule 1 of the Magistrates Court Act 1980.
It is thus permissible for any person to arrest without warrant:
* anyone who is in the act of committing an offence, or whom the arrestor has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be in the act of committing an offence, or
* where an offence has been committed, anyone who is guilty of that offence or whom the arrestor has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be guilty of it

However, both of following two conditions must also be satisfied:
* it appears to the person making the arrest that it is not reasonably practicable for a police constable to make the arrest instead, and
* the arrestor has reasonable grounds for believing that the arrest is &quot;necessary&quot; to prevent one or more of the following:
** the person causing physical injury to themself or others,
** the person suffering physical injury,
** the person causing loss of or damage to property, or
** the person absconding before a constable can assume responsibility for them

Where an arrest is made &quot;after&quot; an offence has been committed, the person who makes the arrest must actually &quot;know&quot;, not simply &quot;suspect&quot; that an offence has actually been committed. If it later turns out that an offence had not been committed, such an arrest would be unlawful.

&quot;Any person&quot; powers can be used to arrest &quot;before&quot; an offence occurs as long as the offence in question falls within the Criminal Attempts Act 1981. This act creates the offence of an &quot;attempted&quot; offence, as long as the offence being attempted is an indictable. For this to apply, the offence must actually be in the process of being attempted—preparatory steps are not sufficient. Furthermore, the definition of what constitutes a &quot;crime&quot; was clarified in &quot;R v Jones (Margaret)&quot; which stated under the S3 CLA1967 meaning, it was held to be any domestic crime in England/Wales. Kent Police have released a brief yet comprehensive guide on reasonable force.

A citizen&#x27;s arrest cannot be made:
* inside a polling station, on a person who commits or is suspected of committing an offence of personation (that is, pretending to be someone else in order to vote) in elections, or
* in relation to an offence of stirring up racial hatred or stirring up religious hatred under the Public Order Act 1986.
* by someone of their own husband, wife or civil partner for the offences of theft or criminal damage where they are the victim.
Although a person cannot make a citizen&#x27;s arrest before an offence takes place, they may use the power provided section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 to use reasonable force for the prevention of crime. This would not allow a citizen&#x27;s arrest before an offence takes place in this sense but would allow any person to use reasonable force to prevent an offence from occurring; for example, restraining a suspected offender who raised a brick in their hand in order to imminently smash a window. A citizen&#x27;s arrest is a form of lawful custody and anyone attempting to flee would commit the offence of escape from lawful custody. Similarly, a person who uses force to resists a citizen&#x27;s arrest would commit the offence of assault with intent to resist arrest.

In addition to an arrest without a warrant, where an arrest warrant is issued by a court, the warrant may name people (other than police officers) who are able to use it to arrest the person against whom it has been issued.

===== Other powers =====
A citizen&#x27;s arrest is a form of lawful custody and anyone attempting to flee may be guilty of attempting to escape from lawful custody. Furthermore, the offence of &#x27;assault with intent to resist arrest or lawful apprehension or detainer of himself&#x27; may apply if the arrestee assaulted the arrestor under Section 38 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. Both assault with intent to resist arrest/lawful apprehension and escaping from lawful custody are indictable, the former being so by the mode of trial of the offence, the latter is a common law offence and therefore indictable only. Therefore, these offences—whether fully carried out or merely attempted—are citizen&#x27;s arrestable in themselves.

A citizen&#x27;s arrest may also be made technically for a warrant for an arrest if the offence listed is indictable as there is no law prohibiting a re-citizen&#x27;s arrest or the number of times they may be arrested for it nor is there a time limit. The warrant would satisfy the requirement for the arrester to have reasonable grounds to suspect the guilt of the arrestee. For example, if an offender failed to attend Crown Court this would satisfy two conditions for a lawful citizen&#x27;s arrest at a later date – that the offence &quot;had&quot; taken place and that it was obviously indictable by way of being tried in Crown Court.

Although not technically citizen&#x27;s arrest powers, any person also has the power to arrest for a common law breach of the peace which also provides any person with a power of entry. Section 3 Criminal Justice Act 1967 also provides any person the power to apprehend a person unlawfully at large e.g. an offender on a recall to prison or in the circumstances where someone has managed to escape from lawful custody.

Until 2006, there was an &quot;any person&quot; power of arrest under part of the Theft Act 1968 in England and Wales that related to poaching, which was used by private water bailiffs (as opposed to Environment Agency bailiffs). This ceased to have effect as a result of a general repeal of such arrest powers by the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. An officer or agent of certain companies may seize and detain any person who has committed an offence against the provisions of the Companies Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 whose name and residence shall be but unknown to such officer or agent, and take them before a justice of the peace, who &quot;shall proceed with all convenient dispatch to the hearing and determining of the complaint against such offender&quot;.

Under the Standing Orders of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, the Serjeant at Arms has the power to take into custody any member of the public who is in a Members-only area of the House, or who misconducts themselves, or who fails to leave when the House sits in private.

Court security officers in England and Wales have the additional power to restrain and remove persons from court buildings under s53 Courts Act 2003 as well as powers of search and seizure of certain articles.

==== Northern Ireland ====
Similar provisions apply to Northern Ireland as to England and Wales, implemented through the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (SI 1989/1341) as amended by the Police and Criminal Evidence (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order (SI 2007/288).

==== Scotland ====

While no statutory provision for citizen&#x27;s arrest exists in Scots law, there is a common law position that anyone committing an offence can be arrested using minimum force if necessary with consideration to what is reasonable in the relevant circumstances. The offence must be a serious one and not merely for a breach of the peace. The person exercising the power must have witnessed the offence occurring therefore they cannot act upon information from another person.

===United States of America===
In the United States, a private person may arrest another without a warrant for a crime occurring in their presence. However, the crimes for which this is permitted vary by state.

====Common law====
Most states have codified the common law rule that a warrantless arrest may be made by a private person for a felony, misdemeanor, or &quot;breach of peace&quot;. &quot;Breach of peace&quot; covers a multitude of violations in which the Supreme Court has even included a misdemeanor seatbelt violation punishable only by a
fine. The term historically included theft, &quot;nightwalking&quot;, prostitution, and playing card and dice games. Texas courts have defined and interpreted the term &quot;breach of the peace&quot; to mean an act that disturbs or threatens to disturb the tranquility enjoyed by the citizens.

====State statutes====
Consider, for an example of this codification, California Penal Code section 837:

&quot;Public offense&quot; is read similarly as breach of peace in this case and includes felonies, misdemeanors, and infractions. There is generally no provision for an investigative detention by a private person under the law. With certain exceptions (see below), an arrest must be made. &quot;Holding them until the police get there&quot; is simply a form of arrest. The officer is accepting the arrest and processing the prisoner on behalf of the private person.

In the case of felonies, a private person may make an arrest for a felony occurring outside their presence, but the rule is that a felony must have, in fact, been committed. For example, consider a suspect that has been seen on surveillance video vandalizing a building to the extent that the arrestor believes it rises to a felony due to the damage. If they find the suspect and make the arrest but it later turns out that it was misdemeanor damage, the arrestor is liable for false arrest because a felony had not, in fact, been committed.

Because most states have codified their arrest laws, there are many variations. For example, in Pennsylvania, the
courts have been clear that a non-law enforcement officer cannot make an arrest for a &quot;summary offense&quot;. In North Carolina, there is no de jure &quot;citizen&#x27;s arrest&quot;. Although it is essentially the same, North Carolina law refers to it as a &quot;detention&quot;. The state of Georgia repealed its citizen&#x27;s arrest law amid accusations that it had the potential for abuse and racial bias after the murder of Ahmaud Arbery and replaced it with a narrower law applying only to business owners, inspectors, security guards, and private investigators.

Other states seem to allow only arrests in cases of felonies, but court decisions have ruled more broadly. For example, in Virginia, the statute appears to only permit warrantless arrests by officers listed in the Code. However, Virginia courts have upheld warrantless arrests by non-law enforcement personnel for breach of the peace misdemeanors. Other non-police persons are granted arrest authority by statute, in the case of those who are state-certified, armed security officers: &quot;A registered armed security officer of a private security services business while at a location which the business is contracted to protect shall have the power to effect an arrest for an offense occurring (i) in his presence on such premises or (ii) in the presence of a merchant, agent, or employee of the merchant the private security business has contracted to protect&quot; and &quot;For the purposes of § 19.2-74, a registered armed security officer of a private security services business shall be considered an arresting officer.&quot;

====Use of force====
In general, a private person is considered to be justified in using non-deadly force upon another if they reasonably believe that: (1) such other person is committing a felony, or a misdemeanor amounting to a breach of the peace; and (2) the force used is necessary to prevent further commission of the offense and to apprehend the offender. The force must be reasonable under the circumstances to restrain the individual arrested. This includes the nature of the offense and the amount of force required to overcome resistance. In Texas, a civilian may use reasonable force, including deadly force if reasonable, to prevent an escape from a lawful citizen&#x27;s arrest.

==== Shopkeeper&#x27;s (merchant&#x27;s) privilege ====
In some states of the United States, the courts recognize a common law shopkeeper&#x27;s privilege under which a shopkeeper is allowed to detain a suspected shoplifter on store property for a reasonable period of time, so long as the shopkeeper has cause to believe that the person detained in fact committed, or attempted to commit, theft of store property. The purpose of this detention is to recover the property and make an arrest if the merchant desires.

==== Differing liability from police ====
Private persons are occasionally granted immunity from civil or criminal liability, like the police are, when arresting others. While the powers to arrest are similar, police are entitled to mistake of fact in most cases, while civilians can be held to a stricter liability depending on the individual state. Police can also detain anyone upon reasonable suspicion. However, ordinary citizens cannot claim &quot;qualified immunity&quot; to attempt to defend against a civil complaint for false arrest.

<text>The bathing machine was a device, popular from the 18th century until the early 20th century, to allow people at beaches to change out of their usual clothes, change into swimwear, and wade in the ocean. Bathing machines were roofed and walled wooden carts that rolled into the sea. Some had solid wooden walls, others canvas walls over a wooden frame, and commonly walls at the sides and curtained doors at each end.

The use of bathing machines was part of the etiquette for sea-bathing to be observed by both men and women who wished to behave respectably.

Especially in Britain, even with the use of the machine to protect modesty, bathing for men and women was usually segregated, so that people of the opposite sex would not see each other in their bathing suits which, although extremely modest by modern standards, were not considered proper clothing in which to be seen in public.

==Use==
The bathing machines in use in Margate, Kent, were described by Walley Chamberlain Oulton in 1805 as:

People entered the small room of the machine while it was on the beach, wearing their street clothing. In the machine they changed into their bathing suit, although men were allowed to bathe nude until the 1860s, placing their street clothes into a raised compartment where they would remain dry.

Probably all bathing machines had small windows, but one writer in the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; of May 26, 1906 considered them &quot;ill-lighted&quot; and wondered why bathing machines were not improved with a skylight.

The machine would be wheeled or slid into the water. The most common machines had large wide wheels and were propelled in and out of the surf by a horse, or a pair of horses, with a driver. Less common were machines pushed in and out of the water by human power. Some resorts had wooden rails into the water for the wheels to roll on, and a few had bathing machines pulled in and out of the sea using cables propelled by a steam engine.

Once in the water, the occupants disembarked from the sea side down steps into the water. Many machines had doors front and back; those with only one door would be backed into the sea or need to be turned around. It was considered essential that the machine blocked any view of the bather from the shore. Some machines were equipped with a canvas tent lowered from the seaside door, sometimes capable of being lowered to the water, giving the bather greater privacy.
Some resorts employed a dipper, a strong person of the same sex who would assist the bather in and out of the sea. Some dippers were said to push bathers into the water, then yank them out, considered part of the experience.

Bathing machines would often be equipped with a small flag which could be raised by the bather as a signal to the driver that they were ready to return to shore.

==History==

According to some sources, the bathing machine was developed in 1750 in Margate, Kent. That version was probably intended to conceal the user until they were mostly submerged in the water because, at the time, bathing costumes were not yet common and most people bathed nude. &quot;Mr. Benjamin Beale, a Quaker, was the inventor of the Bath Machine. Their structure is simple, but quite convenient; and by means of the umbrella, the pleasures of bathing may be enjoyed in so private a manner, as to be consistent with the strictest delicacy.&quot; In the Scarborough Public Library, there is an engraving by John Setterington dated 1736 which shows people bathing and is popularly believed to be first evidence for bathing machines; however Devon claims this was a year earlier in 1735.

Bathing machines were most common in the United Kingdom and parts of the British Empire with a British population, but were also used in France, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, the United States, Mexico, and other nations. 

Prince Albert used one at Osborne Beach near Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, as did Queen Victoria, who used it to sketch and for bathing. She wrote about such an experience in her diary in July 1847. After the monarch&#x27;s death, her machine was used as a chicken coop, but it was restored in the 1950s and put on display in 2012. According to a news report, &quot;The queen&#x27;s bathing machine was unusually ornate, with a front verandah and curtains which would conceal her until she had entered the water. The interior had a changing room and a plumbed-in WC&quot;.

Bathing machines remained in active use on English beaches until the 1890s, when they began to be parked on the beach. Legal segregation of bathing areas in Britain ended in 1901, and the use of bathing machines declined rapidly. They were then used as stationary changing rooms for a number of years. Most of them had disappeared in the United Kingdom by 1914, and, by the start of the 1920s they were almost extinct, even on beaches catering to an older clientele. However, in Aldeburgh, Suffolk, Eric Ravilious was able to paint bathing machines on wheels with winches still in use as late as 1938. In many places around the world they have survived to this day as stationary bathing boxes.

<text>A. Magazine was an Asian American–focused magazine published by A.Media, Inc., and headquartered in midtown Manhattan with offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Geared towards a young audience, its mission was to &quot;report on the developments, address the issues, and celebrate the achievements of this [Asian] dynamic new population.&quot;

It was created in 1989 by Jeff Yang, Amy Chu, Sandi Kim and Bill Yao to cover East Asian American issues and culture, and often featured fashion spreads, advice columns, horoscopes, and news stories. &quot;A. Magazine&quot; grew out of a campus magazine edited by Yang while an undergraduate at Harvard University. Though well-known and influential in the East Asian American community, it was not profitable in its thirteen-year existence.

The magazine operated for twelve years though it reached a circulation high of 200,000. When the economy declined in 2001, the magazine declined. When it ceased on February 20, 2002, it was the largest English-language publication for Asian Americans in the United States, with bi-monthly readership exceeding 200,000 in North America.

In November 1999, &quot;A. Magazine&quot; obtained $4.5 million in venture capital funding, and the company was renamed aMedia, reflecting a branching out into Web publishing. In early 2000, after announcing their expansion into a office in San Francisco, the U.S. economy entered into a downturn. In an attempt to recover, the company merged with Click2Asia in November 2000. After a shareholder fight, the merged company closed in 2002.

<doc id="271013" wikidata="Q6866202" url="?curid=271013" title="Minister for Science (Canada)">
<text>The minister of Science is a vacant office that was in the Cabinet of Canada and existed under various forms from 1971 to 2019, when the portfolio&#x27;s responsibilities were absorbed into the innovation, science and industry portfolio.

==History==
The portfolio was called the Minister of State for Science and Technology from 1971 until 1990, when a cabinet reshuffle saw the creation of two new science-related full cabinet positions: the Minister of Industry, Science and Technology, and the Minister for Science. The former combined aspects of the now-defunct post of Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion and the Minister of State for Science and Technology. While it was active, two of the three full ministers for science were simultaneously Minister of State for Small Business.

When Jean Chrétien came to power in 1993, he did not nominate a full minister for science. Instead, he created the position of Secretary of State (Science, Research and Development), which was assigned by Order-in-Council to assist the Minister of Industry. While this position subsequently changed name in 2008 to Minister of State (Science and Technology), its role did not change much until 2015.

In 2015 under the first Trudeau government, Kirsty Duncan was appointed to the newly created position of Minister of Science. However, this position remained under the same legal framework as its predecessor, responsible for assisting the senior portfolio of Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development (the restyled Minister of Industry). Duncan&#x27;s portfolio was expected to oversee basic research, while Navdeep Bains would oversee applied science. In July 2018, the office&#x27;s portfolio was expanded to include responsibility for Sport Canada and was renamed to Minister of Science and Sport.

Following the 2019 federal election, the portfolio became vacant and Bains&#x27; portfolio was expanded—he was appointed as the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry (previously called, Innovation, Science and Economic Development).

Roufus is the Global Director of Fighter Development for PKA Worldwide. In 2012 he was inducted into the World Kickboxing League Hall of Fame.

==Biography and career==
Rick Roufus began his martial arts practice at the age of 5 under the tutelage of his father Pat J. Roufus, a renowned PKA referee, who had graduated as a black belt in 1973 by Dukan Yun. Rick learned taekwondo from his father. He quickly rose up the national karate points circuit and debuted as a professional kickboxer in his late teens. He had his first professional fight in May 1985 against the U.C. Owens, whom he defeated by unanimous decision after five rounds.

In April 1987, he fought against John Moncayo for the world title of KICK at super middleweight. Roufus knocked out Moncayo in round 7 to win his first world title.

In the beginning of his career, Roufus fought under the rule of full contact where leg kicks, elbow strikes, and knee attacks were not allowed. He changed directions on 5 November 1988 when he challenged Changpuek Kiatsongrit in a non-title fight in Las Vegas. His pre-fight kickboxing record was 28 perfect wins. Roufus knocked Changpuek down twice with his fists in the first round, causing him a broken jaw. During the break, Chanpuek&#x27;s corner spilled a bucket of water and ice in the ring, trying to buy time for Changpuek to recover. Finally Roufus lost by TKO in the fifth round due to the culmination of low kicks that he was not prepared for. Roufus had found out the same day of the fight that they would fight with leg kick rules. After the fight, the Roufus brothers sought out Thai experts to learn the art of kicking and kick control.

On 19 June 1991, Roufus faced Marek Piotrowski. It was a rematch, as Piotrowski had defeated him in their first encounter. The vacant ISKA Full Contact Light World title was on the line, while Piotrowski&#x27;s PKC Full Contact Light Heavyweight World title was also up for grabs. Roufus won by heavy second-round KO from a high kick that left the Polish fighter unconscious on the canvas.

On December 20, 1991, Roufus defended his ISKA Full Contact World Light Heavyweight title against Dutchman Rob Kaman. Initially, Roufus, who had dominated 11 of the 12 rounds, was declared the winner by unanimous decision. Later the bout was declared a no contest after Kaman&#x27;s corner protested that the fourth round had ended 45 seconds early, the only round they believed could have been. It was critical for Kaman as he had managed to land a high kick in minute 1, causing Roufus to reel. A second fight between the pair took place in February 1994 at Palais Omnisports in Paris-Bercy, France. Tickets for the fight sold out (20,000 people) weeks in advance. Roufus won the match by KO in the second round.

On January 22, 1994 Roufus won the IKF Pro Full Contact Rules Light Heavyweight World Title when he defeated Michael McDonald of Vancouver, BC, Canada, by KO at :43 seconds of round 1 at Caesars Tahoe Casino in Lake Tahoe, Nevada.

On March 26, 1994, he traveled to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where he faced Jean-Yves Thériault. Roufus won a unanimous decision after 12 rounds, defending his PKC Full Contact World Light Heavyweight title. In Paris, in 1994, he again faced Ernesto Hoost, WMTA Light Heavyweight World Champion. Roufus dominated the fight for the first 10 rounds but finally lost via KO in round 11 when Hoost landed a powerful high kick.

He later entered the world of boxing. He enjoyed some success, but was never able to fight for a world championship. In August 1996, he challenged for the vacant WBC Continental Americas cruiserweight title. He knocked out Sean McClain, and won his first and only title in boxing.

After several losses, Roufus returned to kickboxing. He emerged victorious at the K-1 USA held August 17, 1998 in Las Vegas, quickly dispatching Pedro Fernandez and Jerome Turcan.

On May 15, 1999 in Lowell Massachusetts, he won the IKF Pro International Rules Heavyweight World title when he defeated Stan Longinidis of Box Hill, Victoria, Australia by RSC after Loniginidis suffered a broken bone in his foot at the end of round 9. It was later revealed that Longinidis had been ill weeks leading to the fight. Roufus was ahead on all three judges&#x27; cards at the time, 89-81, 86-83 and 88-81.

In his MMA debut, Roufus lost to Maurice Smith in the first round via kimura at the event in Tacoma, Washington on February 23, 2008.

In March 2008, Roufus had his second MMA bout, this time in Newkirk, Oklahoma, for Caged Combat Championship Fights. With his first wrestling training partner in MMA working his corner Daniel K. Finch from Yukon, Oklahoma, He defeated Mike Buell via unanimous decision. After a stint in several local promotions, Roufus brought his mixed martial arts record to four wins with six losses.

In 2002 he defeated Kurt Hasley by unanimous decision in the quarterfinals of K-1 USA Las Vegas. In the semifinals he faced Dewey Cooper, whom he also defeated by unanimous decision. In the final he faced Mike McDonald in rematch of their 1994 bout at Caesars Tahoe, where Roufus won his IKF Full Contact Rules World Title when he knocked McDonald out. It was a rematch McDonald was looking forward to, especially with leg kicks this time. However, Roufus had slipped on the ring canvas in his second bout of the night and town his ACL in the bout. Against McDonald he fought cautiously due to the injury because he did not want to risk hurting it more. In the end, he felt like he had done enough to win. However, after three explosive rounds of action, the scores were Judge #1: 29.5 to 28.5 Roufus, Judge #2: 29.5 to 29 Roufus and Judge #3: 29.5 to 29 McDonald. This should have been a majority decision win for Roufus, but instead, it was a draw due to K-1 rules requiring a fighter to win a tournament by two full points. Because of his injury, Roufus withdrew from the bout by choosing not to fight the extra 4th round, giving McDonald the win.

In October 22, 2011, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Roufus won the IKF Legends Title by forfeit when opponent Mighty Mo failed to pass his Nevada State physical. On the night, Roufus fought an exhibition bout against Anthony Newman. Roufus was finally able to meet up with Mo almost a year later on September 8, 2012 in Los Angeles California, winning a three-round split decision.

His last professional fight was at the K-1 World Grand Prix 2012 in Tokyo final 16. At the age of 46, he faced 25-year-old James Wilson. The result of the match was a draw.

==Personal life==
He is the older brother of Duke Roufus, who is also a kickboxer and a Muay Thai and mixed martial arts instructor.

<text>Batanes, officially the Province of Batanes (; Ilocano: &quot;Probinsia ti Batanes&quot;; , ), is an archipelagic province in the Philippines, administratively part of the Cagayan Valley region. It is the northernmost province in the Philippines, and the smallest, both in population and land area. The capital is Basco, located on the island of Batan, and is also the most populous municipality in the province.

The island group is located approximately north of the Luzon mainland and about south of Taiwan (Pingtung County). Batanes is separated from the Babuyan Islands of Cagayan Province by the Balintang Channel, and from Taiwan by the Bashi Channel. 

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Batanes&quot; is a Hispanicized plural form derived from the Ivatan endonym &quot;Batan&quot;.

==History==
===Early history===
The ancestors of today&#x27;s Ivatans descended from Austronesians who migrated to the islands 4,000 years ago during the Neolithic period. They lived in fortified mountain areas called &quot;idjangs&quot; and drank sugar-cane wine, or &quot;palek&quot;. They used gold as currency and were farmers. They were seafarers and boat-builders. Batanes was a major site for the Maritime Jade Road, one of the most extensive sea-based trade networks of a single geological material in the prehistoric world, operating for 3,000 years from 2000 BCE to 1000 CE.

===Spanish colonial era===
In 1687, the British explorer, privateer, and naturalist William Dampier visited the islands and named them in honour of prominent Dutch and British figures. Itbayat was named &quot;Orange Isle&quot; after William of Orange. Batan was named &quot;Grafton Isle&quot; after Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton. Sabtang Isle was named &quot;Monmouth Isle&quot; after James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth. During his stay in August and September 1687, Dampier made valuable observations about settlement types and subsistence of the inhabitants of the Batanes. He mentioned the existence of terraced and defended settlements on elevated terrain (now known as &quot;ijang&quot;) and listed various types of types of tubers and vegetables, and pigs and goats as common food sources, but notably no wet rice or cattle.

In 1783, the Spanish claimed Batanes as part of the Philippines under the rule of Governor-General José Basco y Vargas. Batanes was ruled as part of the &quot;Provincia de Cagayan.&quot; The Bashi Channel was increasingly used by English East India Company ships and the Spanish authorities brought the islands under their direct administration to prevent them falling under British control. The Ivatan remained on their &quot;idjang&quot; castle-fortresses for some time. In 1790, Governor Guerrero decreed that Ivatans were to live in the lowlands and leave their remote &quot;idjang&quot;. In response, the mangpus, or indigenous Ivatan leaders, headed by the Ivatan hero Aman Dangat, revolted against the Spanish invaders.

Using guns, the Spanish ended the revolution, killing Aman Dangat and several other Ivatan leaders. Basco and Ivana were the first towns established under full Spanish control. Mahatao was then administered by Basco, while Uyugan and Sabtang, by Ivana. Itbayat was not organized until the 1850s, its coast being a ridge. Soon, Ilocanos came to the islands and integrated with the local population. 

Roads, ports, bridges, churches and government buildings were built in this time. Limestone technology used by the Spanish spread to the islands, making bridges strong and fortified. Some of these bridges still remain at Ivana and Mahatao. By 1890, many Ivatans were in Manila, and became &quot;ilustrados&quot;, who then brought home with them the revolutionary ideas of the Katipunan. These Ivatans, who were then discontented with Spanish rule, killed the ruling General Fortea and declared the end of Spanish rule.

===American colonial era===
Toward the end of the Spanish administration, Batanes was made a part of Cagayan. Due to historical reasons from that time, some segments of Taiwan society argue that the islands should not belong to the Philippines. Batanes was created as a sub-province of Cagayan on August 20, 1907 with the approval of Act No. 1693. In 1909, the new American authorities organized it into an independent province, with the approval of Act No. 1952. During this time, additional public schools were constructed and more Ivatan became aware of their place in the Philippines.

In 1920, the first wireless telegraph was installed, followed by an airfield in 1930. New roads were constructed and the Batanes High School was instituted around this time as well.

===Japanese occupation===
Because of their strategic location, the islands were one of the first points occupied by the invading Japanese imperial forces at the outbreak of the Pacific War. On the morning of December 8, 1941, the Batan Task Force from Taiwan landed on the Batan Islands, which became the first American territory occupied by the Japanese. The objective of the invasion - to secure the small airfield outside Basco - was accomplished without resistance. Japanese fighters from Basco took part in the raid on Clark Air Base the following day. Over the next several days, the success of the Japanese bombing of Clark Field rendered a base at Basco unnecessary, and on December 10, 1941, the naval combat force was withdrawn to participate in the invasion of Camiguin.

As part of an administrative reorganization, the province of Batanes was downgraded to a municipality of Cagayan from 1942 to 1944. Upon its restoration, Victor de Padua, an Ilocano who was one of the first School Superintendents on Batan, was made Provincial Governor. Early in 1945, the island was liberated by the Philippine Commonwealth forces of the 1st and 12th Infantry Divisions of the Philippine Commonwealth Army.

===Philippine independence===
Batanes was briefly marred by political violence during the 1969 presidential elections, when the Philippine Constabulary&#x27;s Special Forces allowed motorcycle-riding goons dubbed the &quot;Suzuki boys&quot; to secure the victory of Rufino Antonio Jr., an ally of President Ferdinand Marcos, as representative of the Lone District of Batanes in the House of Representatives of the Philippines through a campaign of terror and intimidation. The resulting outcry led to the Supreme Court decrying the &quot;rape of democracy&quot; in the province, and annulled Antonio&#x27;s victory in 1970 in favor of his rival, Jorge Abad.

In 1984, Pacita Abad, the foremost Ivatan visual artist, became the first woman to be awarded the Ten Outstanding Young Men (TOYM) award, breaking 25 years of male dominance. In her acceptance speech, she said, &quot;it was long overdue that Filipina women were recognized, as the Philippines was full of outstanding women&quot; and referred proudly to her mother.
In 1993, the Batanes Protected Landscape and Seascape, which encompassed the entire province, was listed in the Tentative List of the Philippines for UNESCO World Heritage Site inscription in the future.

In 1997, the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act (IPRA) was passed in Philippine Congress. The law paved the way for the indigenous territorial rights of the Ivatans. The province has since promoted its Ivatan roots. Part of the Ilocano population has returned to mainland Luzon. On December 7, 2004, Pacita Abad died after finishing her last international artwork while suffering from cancer.

A minor dispute between the Philippines and Taiwan erupted in 2007, after &quot;Taiwan Times&quot; published an editorial written by Tamkang University professor Chen Hurng-yu, claiming that Taiwan has territorial claims over Batanes and encouraging the Taiwanese government to take over the province. This, despite the islands being first claimed by Spanish Philippines in 1783 and later incorporated and administered by the Philippines without any contesting nation since the 18th century.

==Geography==

The province has a total area of comprising ten islands situated within the Luzon Strait between the Balintang Channel and Taiwan. The islands are sparsely populated and subject to frequent typhoons. The three largest islands, Batan, Itbayat, and Sabtang, are the only inhabited islands.

The northernmost island in the province, also the northernmost land in the entire Philippines, is Mavulis (or Y&#x27;ami) Island. Other islands in the chain are Misanga (or North), Ditarem, Siayan, Diogo (or Dinem), Ivuhos, and Dequey. The islands are part of the Luzon Volcanic Arc.

===Topography===

Almost one-half of Batanes is hills and mountains. Batan Island is generally mountainous on the north and southeast. It has a basin in the interior. Itbayat Island slopes gradually to the west, being mountainous and hilly along its northern, eastern coast. On Sabtang, mountains cover the central part, making the island slope outward to the coast.

The islands are situated between the vast expanse of the waters of Bashi Channel and Balintang Channel, where the Pacific Ocean merges with the China Sea. The area is a sea lane between the Philippines and Japan, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. It is rich with marine resources, including the rarest sea corals in the world.

The province is hilly and mountainous, with only or 7.1% of its area level to undulating terrain. 78.2% or 17,994.4 hectares vary from rolling hills to steep and very steep. Forty-two percent (42%) or are steep to very steep land. Because of the terrain of the province, drainage is good and prolonged flooding is non-existent. 

The main island of Batan has the largest share of level and nearly level lands, followed by Itbayat and Sabtang, respectively. Itbayat has gently rolling hills and nearly level areas on semi-plateaus surrounded by continuous massive cliffs rising from above sea level, with no shorelines. Sabtang has its small flat areas spread sporadically on its coasts, while its interior is dominated by steep mountains and deep canyons. Batan Island and Sabtang have intermittent stretches of sandy beaches and rocky shorelines.

The terrain of the province, while picturesque at almost every turn, has limited the potential for expansion of agriculture in an already very small province.

===Climate===
Batanes has a tropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Am&quot;). The average yearly temperature is . The average monthly temperature ranges from in January to in July, similar to that of Southern Taiwan. Precipitation is abundant throughout the year. The rainiest month is August. The driest month is April. November to February are the coldest months. 

There is a misconception that Batanes is constantly battered by typhoons. Batanes is mentioned frequently in connection with typhoons, because it holds the northernmost weather station in the Philippines, thus, it is a reference point for all typhoons that enter the Philippine area. In September 2016, Typhoon Meranti impacted the entire province, including a landfall on Itbayat.

===Administrative divisions===
Batanes is subdivided into 6 municipalities, all encompassed by a lone congressional district.


===Barangays===
The 6 municipalities of the province comprise a total of 29 barangays. &quot;Ihuvok II&quot; in Basco was the most populous in 2010, and &quot;Nakanmuan&quot; in Sabtang was the least.

==Demographics==
The population of Batanes in the 2020 census was 18,831 people. The population density was .

The natives are called Ivatans. They share prehistoric cultural and linguistic commonalities with the Babuyan on Babuyan Island and the Tao people of Orchid Island.

This divided homeland is a result of the Dutch invasion of Taiwan in 1624 (Dutch Formosa) and Spanish invasion in 1626 (Spanish Formosa). The northern half of the Ivatan homeland, Formosa and Orchid Island were part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. This area came under Dutch governance. The Dutch were expelled in 1662 by forces of the Chinese Southern Ming dynasty, led by the Chinese pirate Koxinga who then set himself up as the King of Taiwan.

The southern half of the Ivatan homeland, the islands of Batanes, was reinforced and fortified by Spanish refugees from Formosa, before being formally joined in the 18th century with the Spanish government in Manila.

An Ilocano minority population lives in Batanes. Some have left and returned to mainland Luzon.

===Languages===
The main languages spoken in Batanes are Ivatan, which is spoken on the islands of Batan and Sabtang. Itbayaten is spoken primarily on the island of Itbayat. The Ivatan which is dominant in the province is considered to be one of the Austronesian languages. From college level down to elementary level, the language is widely spoken. Ilocano, the lingua franca of northern Luzon, is also widely spoken and understood by the Ivatans. The Ivatans also speak and understand Tagalog and English.

Ivatan-speaking communities can be found in other parts of the country, mainly in mainland Luzon, as well as overseas.

==Ecology==
An extensive survey of the ecology of Batanes provided the scientific basis for confirming the need for a national park in Batanes protecting the Batanes protected landscapes and seascapes, proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, submitted in August 1993. An effort is underway to declare the whole province, along with the sugar central sites in Negros, as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

===Flora and fauna===
The province is the home of the unique conifer species &quot;Podocarpus costalis&quot;. Although it is reportedly growing in some other places such as coasts of Luzon, Catanduanes and even Taiwan, full blossoming and fruiting are observed only in Batanes. Its fruiting capacity on the island remains a mystery but is likely due to several factors such as climate, soil and type of substratum of the island.

Several species of birds, bats, reptiles and amphibians inhabit the island. Many of those are endemic to the Philippines. The island is a sanctuary for different migratory birds during winter in the Northern Hemisphere. The Batanes archipelago, along with the nearby Babuyan Islands, have been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because they support significant populations of resident Taiwan green pigeons, Ryukyu scops-owls and short-crested monarchs, Chinese egrets on passage, and wintering yellow buntings.

==Economy==

About 75% of the Ivatans are farmers and fishermen. The rest are employed in the government and services sector. Garlic and cattle are major cash crops. Ivatans plant &quot;camote&quot; (sweet potato), cassava, &quot;gabi&quot; or tuber and a unique variety of white uvi. Sugarcane is raised to produce &quot;palek&quot;, a kind of native wine, and vinegar.

In recent years, fish catch has declined due to the absence of technical know-how. Employment opportunities are scarce. Most of the educated Ivatans have migrated to urban centers or have gone abroad.

A wind diesel generating plant was commissioned in 2004.

Distance and bad weather work against its economic growth. Certain commodities like rice, soft drinks, and gasoline carry a 75% to 100% mark-up over Manila retail prices.

==Transportation==
The island province of Batanes is accessible by air, via Basco Airport and Itbayat Airport. There are daily flights from Manila by Philippine Airlines bound to Basco Airport at Batan Island. There are also flights from Tuguegarao City (Cagayan) by Sky Pasada as of 2024. These two airlines make Batan Island accessible from the mainland via air travel. The other local airlines previously serving Basco Airport have stopped their transport services after the COVID 19 Pandemic. As of 2024, PAL Express has flown to Batanes since May 2013. Meanwhile, Itbayat, an island Municipality of the Province of Batanes, is accessible via Basco Airport. There are no direct flights from the mainland to Itbayat. Itbayat may also be accessed via ferry boats from Basco. Meanwhile, Sabtang, also an island municipality like Itbayat, is accessible via ferry boats from Batan Island, particularly from Ivana Port, a Municipality in the main Island of Batan.

==Values==
The Ivatan people of Batanes are one of the most egalitarian societies in the Philippines. The prime motivator of the cultural values of the Ivatans are imbibed in their pre-colonial belief systems of respecting nature and all people. The Ivatans, both the older and younger generations, have one of the highest incidences of social acceptance to minority groups in the country. 

The Ivatans have a high respect for the elderly and the prowess of natural phenomena such as waves, sea breeze, lightning, thunders, earthquakes, and wildlife congregations. Discriminating someone based on skin color, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, and traditions on nature is unacceptable in Ivatan values. Land grabbing is a grave crime in Ivatan societies, making ancestral domain certification an important part of Ivatan jurisprudence since the enactment of the IPRA Law. 

==Heritage==
The entire province is listed in the UNESCO tentative list for inscription in the World Heritage List. The government has been finalizing the site&#x27;s inscription, establishing museums and conservation programs since 2001. Seven intangible heritage elements of the Ivatan have been set by the Philippine government in its initial inventory in 2012. The elements are undergoing a process to be included in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

===Natural===

* &quot;Sabtang Island&quot; is undisturbed and unspoiled. It has intermittent white sand beaches with steep mountains and deep canyons with small level areas sporadically found along the coastline. Southwest of Batan Island, Sabtang is accessible by 30-minute falowa ride from Radiwan Port in Ivana. Sabtang Island is also the take-off point for Ivuhos Island from Barangay Nakanmuan.
* &quot;Itbayat Island&quot; is located north of Batan Island. Itbayat is shaped like a giant bowl. The island is surrounded by massive boulders and cliffs rising from above sea level and has no shoreline. It has a dirt airstrip for light aircraft. A regular ferry runs the Batan-Itbayat route. Travel time is about four hours by falowa from Basco Seaport. A light plane flies from Basco Airport to Itbayat at around P1,875 per person and leaves only when the plane is full.
* &quot;Batan Island&quot; is the most populated island of the province. It is composed of four municipalities: Basco, Ivana, Uyugan, and Mahatao. Basco is the center of commerce and the seat of the provincial government.
* &quot;Mount Iraya&quot; is a dormant volcano standing at whose last eruption was recorded in 505 AD. Mountaineering, trekking, and trailblazing are recommended sports activities on the mountain. Walking distance from Basco, the top of Mt. Iraya can be reached in about three hours.
* &quot;Mavulis Island&quot; is the northernmost island of Batanes. From this location, one can see Formosa (Taiwan) on a clear day. Tatus or coconut crabs abound on the island surrounded by rich marine life.
* &quot;Di-atay Beach&quot; is a cove with multi-colored rocks and white sand ideal for picnics and beachcombing. Located along the highway of Mahatao, it is from Basco.

* &quot;Mt. Matarem&quot; is an extinct volcano at its summit. It is from Basco.
* &quot;White Beach&quot; at Vatang, Hapnit, and Mavatuy Point, all in Mahatao.
* &quot;Storm-proof&quot; Stone houses in Batanes many residents during typhoon made up their already-fortified houses with wood and secured the roofs with nets and ropes. This was done to ensure that the structures—which symbolize the Ivatan&#x27;s strength and resilience against disasters—outlast the high-pressure winds of a typhoon that is expected to unleash. Tapangkos or covering were also installed on the doors and windows of several buildings in Batanes, including the capitol building. During heavy storms, it was also a time for Bayanihan of the residents as they helped each other tie-down roofs.

===Man-made===

* &quot;Radar Tukon&quot; was a United States weather station on a hilltop. It offers a magnificent 360-degree view of Batan Island, the South China Sea, Mt. Iraya, Basco proper, boulder lined cliffs and the Pacific Ocean. At present, it houses the northernmost weather station in the Philippines, the Basco Radar Station, and is only from Basco.

<text>Macedonius I of Constantinople (Greek: Μακεδόνιος; died after 360) was a Greek bishop of Constantinople from 342 up to 346, and from 351 until 360. He inspired the establishment of the Pneumatomachi (also called Macedonians), a sect later declared heretical.

== Biography ==
After bishop Alexander of Constantinople&#x27;s death in 336, his orthodox followers supported Paul I of Constantinople. On the other hand, the Arians rallied round Macedonius I. The former was ordained bishop but did not hold his bishopric long. The Semi-Arian Roman emperor Constantius II came to Constantinople, convened a synod of Arian bishops, banished Paul I, and, to the disappointment of Macedonius I, translated Eusebius of Nicomedia to the vacant see. This was thought to have been in 338.

Eusebius&#x27;s death in 341 restarted hostilities between the partisans of Paul I and Macedonius I. Paul I returned, and was introduced into the Irene church of Constantinople; Arian bishops immediately ordained Macedonius in St. Paul&#x27;s church. So violent did the tumult become that Constantius II sent his general Hermogenes (died 342) to eject Paul I for a second time. His soldiers met with open resistance; the general was killed and his body dragged through the city.

Constantius II at once left Antioch and punished Constantinople by depriving the people of half their daily allowance of corn. Paul I was expelled; Macedonius I was severely blamed for his part in these disturbances, and for allowing himself to be ordained without imperial sanction; but over all the Arians triumphed. Macedonius I was permitted to officiate the church in which he had been consecrated. Paul I went to Rome, and he and Athanasius of Alexandria and other orthodox bishops expelled from their sees were sent back by Pope Julius I with letters rebuking those who had deposed them. Philip the prefect executed the fresh orders of the emperor in hurrying Paul into exile to Thessalonica, and in reinstating Macedonius, but not without bloodshed.

Macedonius held the see for about six years, while letters and delegates, the pope and the emperors, synods and counter-synods, were debating and disputing the treatment of Paul I and Athanasius. In 349 the alternative of war offered by Constans, emperor of the West, induced Constantius II to reinstate Paul I; and Macedonius I had to retire to a private church. The murder of Constans in 350 placed the East under the sole control of Constantius II, and Paul I was at once exiled. Imperial edicts followed, which permitted the Arians to claim to be the dominant faction in the church.

Macedonius I is said to have signalled his return to power by acts which, if truly reported, brand him as a cruel bigot. The Novatianists suffered perhaps even more fearfully than the orthodox and some of them were stung into a desperate resistance: those of Constantinople removing the materials of their church to a distant suburb of the city; those at Mantinium in Paphlagonia daring to face the imperial soldiers sent to expel them from their home. &quot;The exploits of Macedonius&quot;, says Socrates Scholasticus, &quot;on behalf of Christianity, consisted of murders, battles, incarcerations, and civil wars&quot;.

An act of presumption finally lost him the imperial favor in 358. The Sepulchre containing the body of Constantine the Great was in danger of falling to pieces, and Macedonius determined to remove them. The question was made a party one. The orthodox assailed as sacrilege &quot;the disinterment of the supporter of the Nicene faith&quot;, the Macedonians pleaded the necessities of structural repair. When the remains were conveyed to the church of Acacius of Caesarea, the excited populace met in the church and churchyard; so frightful a carnage ensued that the place was filled with blood and slaughtered bodies. Constantius II&#x27;s anger was great against Macedonius I because of the slaughter, but even more, because he had removed the body without consulting him.

When Macedonius I presented himself at the council of Seleucia in 359, it was ruled that being under accusation it was not proper for him to remain (Socrates, II, 40). His opponents, Acacius of Caesarea, Eudoxius of Antioch, and others, followed him to Constantinople, and, availing themselves of the emperor&#x27;s indignation, deposed him in 360 on the ground of cruelty and canonical irregularities. Macedonius I retired to a suburb of the city and died there.

He is said to have elaborated the views with which his name is connected in his retirement. The &quot;Macedonians&quot;, his followers, did not believe in the divinity of the Holy Spirit.

<text>The silky-flycatchers are a small family, Ptiliogonatidae, of passerine birds. The family contains only four species in three genera. They were formerly lumped with waxwings and hypocolius in the family Bombycillidae, and they are listed in that family by the Sibley-Monroe checklist. The family is named for their silky plumage and their aerial flycatching techniques, although they are only distantly related to the Old World flycatchers (Muscicapidae) and the tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae).

They occur mainly in Central America from Panama to Mexico, with one species, the phainopepla, extending northwards into the southwestern US. Most do not engage in long-distance migration (instead wandering widely in search of fruit), but the phainopepla is migratory over the northern part of its range.

They are related to waxwings, and like that group have soft silky plumage, usually gray or pale yellow in color. All species, with the exception of the black-and-yellow phainoptila, have small crests. They range in size from 18 to 25 cm in length and are mostly slender birds (with the exception again of the black-and-yellow phainoptila). All the species in this family are sexually dimorphic in both plumage color and tail length. Juveniles of both sexes are colored like the female.

These birds eat fruit or insects. The phainopepla is particularly dependent on desert mistletoe, &quot;Phoradendron californicum&quot;.

They are found in various types of woodland (semi-desert with trees for the phainopepla), and they nest in trees.

<doc id="271025" wikidata="Q542554" url="?curid=271025" title="Screen test">
<text>A screen test is a method of determining the suitability of an actor or actress for performing on film or in a particular role. It is typically a secondary or later stage in the audition process. The performer is generally given a scene, or selected lines and actions, and instructed to perform in front of a camera to see if they are suitable. The developed film is later evaluated by the relevant production personnel such as the casting director and the director. The actor may be asked to bring a prepared monologue or alternatively, the actor may be given a script to read at sight (&quot;cold reading&quot;). In some cases, the actor may be asked to read a scene, in which another performer reads the lines of another character.

A screen test can also be used to determine the chemistry between two potential actors or actresses, to see if they work well together or not. They may be told to read out their characters&#x27; lines from a scene, and perform them together.

==Types==
Screen tests can also be used to judge the suitability of costume, make-up and other details, but these are generally called costume or make-up tests. Different types of actors can have different tasks for each individual test. For example, a lead for a musical theater-type movie could be requested to sing a popular song or learn a dance routine. Screen tests are routinely used in films and commercials. They are also used for short films.

International actors such as Bruce Lee were given screen tests to demonstrate that they are sufficiently articulate in the relevant language. In Lee&#x27;s case, for the role of Kato in &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;, he was asked to converse about Chinese culture in English to judge his grasp of the language, then to demonstrate some martial arts moves to show off his physical skills.

<doc id="271029" wikidata="Q928668" url="?curid=271029" title="Eudoxius of Antioch">
<text>Eudoxius of Antioch (; died 370) was the fifth archibishop of Constantinople from 27 January 360 to early 370, previously bishop of Germanicia and of Antioch. Eudoxius was one of the most influential Arians.

== Biography ==
Eudoxius was from Arabissos of Asia Minor. Eudoxius came to Eustathius, bishop of Antioch between 324 and 331, seeking holy orders. However, Eustathius found his doctrine unsound and refused him. Nevertheless, when Eustathius was deposed, the Arians or Eusebius of Nicomedia had everything their own way and admitted Eudoxius to orders and made him bishop of Germanicia, on the confines of Syria, Cilicia, and Cappadocia. This bishopric he held at least 17 years, the period of the principal intrigues against Athanasius of Alexandria, and of the reigns of Constantine the Great&#x27;s sons.

In 341 the council of the Dedication or Encaenia was held under Placillus at Antioch. Eudoxius of Antioch attended. He was an Arian pure and simple, a disciple of Aëtius of Antioch, a friend of Eunomius of Cyzicus. The council produced four creeds, in which the Eusebian party succeeded in making their doctrine as plausible as might be, and the second of these became known as the &quot;Creed of the Dedication&quot;. Athanasius says that Eudoxius was sent with Martyrius of Antioch and Macedonius I of Constantinople to take the new creed of Antioch to Italy. This new creed may, however, have been the Macrostich, or Long Formula, drawn up at a later council of Antioch.

In 343 or 347 the rival councils of Serdica and Philippopolis were held. At the latter was drawn up a creed more Arian than those of Antioch, and it was signed by Eudoxius. Between 355 and 359 Eudoxius was in attendance on the emperor in the West when news came of the death of Leontius of Antioch. Against the canons, he took over the see of Antioch. Allegedly excusing himself on the plea that the affairs of Germanicia required his presence, Eudoxius hastened to Antioch, and, representing himself as nominated by the emperor, got himself made bishop, and sent Asphalus, a presbyter of Antioch, to make the best of the case at court. Roman emperor Constantius II wrote to the church of Antioch: &quot;Eudoxius went to seek you without my sending him ... To what restraint will men be amenable, who impudently pass from city to city, seeking with a most unlawful appetite every occasion to enrich themselves?&quot;. Nonetheless, the emperor confirmed the election.

In the first year of his episcopate at Antioch, Eudoxius held a council, which received the creed of Sirmium. An idea may be formed of the Homoiousian reception of his sermons from three different sources. Hilary of Poitiers, then in the East, heard Eudoxius in his cathedral, and wished his ears had been deaf. Theodoret and Epiphanius of Salamis reported him as boasting that he had the same knowledge about God as God had about Himself.

In September 359, a Council of Seleucia was held at Seleucia Isauria, the orthodox forming a very small minority. The majority signed the &quot;Creed of the Dedication&quot;; Eudoxius who was present, was deposed by Basil of Ancyra&#x27;s party, and appears to have sought the shelter of the court at Constantinople. Here, by the aid of the Acacians, he secured his appointment as bishop on the deposition of Macedonius I of Constantinople, and on 27 January 360, took possession of his throne in the presence of 72 bishops. On 15 February the great church of Constantinople, Saint Sophia, begun in 342 by the emperor Constantius II, was dedicated.

Eudoxius, it is claimed, mounting his episcopal throne before the expectant multitude of courtiers, ecclesiastics, and citizens, began with the words: &quot;The Father is &quot;asebes&quot;, the Son is &quot;eusebes&quot;.&quot; A great tumult of indignation arose on all sides in St. Sophia. The orator, unabashed, explained: &quot;The Father is &quot;asebes&quot; because He honours nobody; the Son is &quot;eusebes&quot; because He honours the Father&quot;. The new cathedral echoed with peals of uncontrollable laughter. Thus, says Socrates of Constantinople, these tore the church to pieces by their captious subtilties.

Eudoxius consecrated his friend Eunomius to the see of Cyzicus, but such complaints were brought to the Roman emperor Constantius II that he ordered Eudoxius to depose him. Eudoxius acquiesced to the emperor&#x27;s command and quietly persuaded Eunomius to retire.

In 365 an attack was made on Eudoxius by the semi-Arians, now called Macedonians. Holding a meeting at Lampsacus, they signed the &quot;Creed of the Dedication&quot;, cited Eudoxius and his party before them, and, as they did not come, sentenced them to deprivation; but Roman emperor Valens refused to confirm the proceedings.

In 367 Valens, as he was setting out for the Gothic War, was induced by his wife Domnica to receive baptism from Eudoxius. In the same year, he issued, likely under the advice of Eudoxius, an order that such bishops as had been banished by Constantius II and had returned under Roman emperor Julian should again be exiled.

The years during which Eudoxius and Valens acted together were allegedly troubled by portents, which Homoousians attributed to the anger of Heaven at Valens&#x27; banishment of bishops who would not admit Eudoxius to their communion. Eudoxius died in 370.

<doc id="271030" wikidata="Q6113225" url="?curid=271030" title="Macquarie Dictionary">
<text>The Macquarie Dictionary () is a dictionary of Australian English. It is considered by many to be the standard reference on Australian English. It also pays considerable attention to New Zealand English. Originally it was a publishing project of Jacaranda Press, a Brisbane educational publisher, for which an editorial committee was formed, largely from the Linguistics department of Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. It is now published by Macquarie Dictionary Publishers, an imprint of Pan Macmillan Australia Pty Ltd. In October 2007 it moved its editorial office from Macquarie University to the University of Sydney, and later to the Pan Macmillan offices in the Sydney central business district.

In addition to its two-volume flagship dictionary, shorter editions including the &quot;Macquarie Concise Dictionary&quot;, &quot;Macquarie Compact Dictionary&quot;, &quot;Macquarie Budget Dictionary&quot; and &quot;Macquarie Little Dictionary&quot; are published.

==History==
The first seven editions of the &quot;Macquarie Dictionary&quot; were edited by lexicographer Susan Butler, who joined the project in 1970 as a research assistant, and was its chief editor by the time the first edition was published in 1981. Butler retired as the &quot;Macquarie&quot;&#x27;s editor in March 2018 after 48 years with the publisher.

A detailed history of the dictionary and its associated publications is Pat Manser&#x27;s &quot;More Than Words: The Making of the Macquarie Dictionary&quot; (Sydney: Macquarie Dictionary, 2021).

=== First Edition ===
The original version of the &quot;Macquarie Dictionary&quot; was based on Hamlyn&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedic World Dictionary&quot; of 1971, which in turn was based on Random House&#x27;s &quot;American College Dictionary&quot; of 1947, which was based on the 1927 &quot;New Century Dictionary&quot;, which was based on &quot;The Imperial Dictionary of the English Language&quot;, which itself was based on Noah Webster&#x27;s &quot;American Dictionary of the English Language&quot; second edition of 1841.

The first edition had an introduction by Australian historian Manning Clark.

Since its first publication in 1981, its use has grown so that it has come to rival longer-established dictionaries from elsewhere in the English-speaking world as a standard authority on the English language within Australia.

=== Second Edition ===
The second edition was published in 1991 and introduced encyclopedic content to many entries. It has an introduction by Australian author Donald Horne.
=== Third Edition ===
The third edition, published in 1997, made use of an in-house corpus of Australian writing, Ozcorp, to add a large number of examples of Australian usage, to give some of the flavour of an historical dictionary. This edition also gave a good coverage of English in Asia. It has an introduction by Australian author David Malouf.

=== Fourth Edition ===
The fourth edition, published in 2005, increased the number of citations, includes etymologies for many phrases, and pays particular attention to Australian regionalisms. It has an introduction by Australian author Thomas Keneally.

=== Fifth Edition ===
The fifth edition was published in October 2009 and places particular emphasis on words relating to the environment and climate change. It has an introduction by the then Australian Governor-General Quentin Bryce.

=== Sixth Edition ===
The sixth edition was published in October 2013 and includes an update of new words and senses as well as words and phrases from other varieties of English that impinge on Australian English, such as British English, American English and English in Southeast Asia, China and India. It has an introduction by Australian author Les Murray.

=== Seventh Edition ===
The seventh edition of the &quot;Macquarie Dictionary&quot; was published on 28 February 2017. With a foreword by Australian author Kate Grenville, this edition included thousands of new words and senses along with Australian regionalisms and a collection of words from the Australian experience in World War I.

=== Eighth Edition ===
The eighth edition of the &quot;Macquarie Dictionary&quot; was published on 28 July 2020. With a foreword by Australian author Kim Scott, it featured 3500 new entries.

=== Ninth Edition ===
The ninth edition of the &quot;Macquarie Dictionary&quot; was published on 12 September 2023. With a foreword by Australian author Markus Zusak, the ninth edition featured hundreds of new entries and updated definitions.

== Preferred spellings ==
The dictionary records standard Australian English spelling, which is closer to British than American spelling, with spellings like &quot;colour&quot;, &quot;centre&quot;, &quot;defence&quot; and &quot;practice/practise&quot; (noun/verb). It gives &quot;-ise&quot; spellings first, listing &quot;-ize&quot; spellings as acceptable variants, unlike the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; and some other dictionaries of British English, which continue to prefer &quot;-ize&quot; to &quot;-ise&quot; in spite of the opposite tendency among the British general public (see Oxford spelling). &quot;Labour&quot;, however, is spelt &quot;Labor&quot; when referring to the Australian political party. One difference from British spelling is the noun &quot;program&quot;, which the &quot;Macquarie Dictionary&quot; gives as the preferred spelling in preference to &quot;programme&quot;.

== Collaborations ==

=== Word of the Year ===

Each year the editors select a short-list of new words added to the dictionary, and invite the public to vote on their favourite. The public vote is held in December and results in the People&#x27;s Choice winner. There is also a word selected by a committee.

===Word for Word podcast===
The team behind the &quot;Macquarie Dictionary&quot; produced a podcast called &quot;Word for Word&quot; from 2016 through to the end of 2021. The podcast explored surprising histories behind everyday words and phrases, went behind the scenes with the dictionary editors, and highlighted some of Australia&#x27;s word lovers, from Scrabble champions to hip-hop artists.

==Versions==
A number of smaller versions of the dictionary are available, including a compact edition, as well as companion volumes such as a thesaurus. The latest edition of the main complete version of the &quot;Macquarie Dictionary&quot; is the eighth, published in 2020. Both the complete dictionary and a student dictionary are available as iOS applications.

===&quot;Macquarie Dictionary Online&quot;===
The &quot;Macquarie Dictionary Online&quot; is the most comprehensive and up-to-date version of the dictionary available, with new words, phrases, and definitions added twice annually. It has the greatest coverage of encyclopedic and non-encyclopedic entries, and provides spoken pronunciations. Subscriptions are available to the complete version as well as a student version.

===Apps===
The &quot;Macquarie Dictionary&quot; is available in two iOS app editions: the Macquarie Dictionary Complete app, and the Macquarie School Dictionary app.

<doc id="271031" wikidata="Q918838" url="?curid=271031" title="Perry Farrell">
<text>Perry Farrell (born Peretz Bernstein; March 29, 1959) is an American singer, songwriter, and musician referred to as the &quot;Godfather of Alternative Music&quot;. Farrell began his career with Psi Com in the early 1980s, before becoming the frontman of the band Jane&#x27;s Addiction. He became well known for his success with Jane&#x27;s Addiction; the band quickly became a key act in the &#x27;80s Los Angeles music scene, blending punk, metal, and psychedelic rock to create a unique sound. Their daring live performances and experimental approach resonated with disillusioned youth, contributing to the rise of alternative music as a form of rebellion and self-expression.

As part of the farewell tour for Jane&#x27;s Addiction in 1991, Farrell founded Lollapalooza, which has evolved into an annual festival of multiple genres. Farrell is also the frontman of Porno for Pyros.

Farrell has also released a number of solo albums, and also launched a number of other music related projects, including Kind Heaven Orchestra, Satellite Party and Heaven After Dark.

==Early life==
Peretz Bernstein was born in the Queens borough of New York City on March 29, 1959. He was raised in a Jewish family, his mother was an artist and his father was a jeweler. When Farrell was three, his mother died by suicide, an event which he later wrote about in Jane&#x27;s Addiction songs &quot;Then She Did&quot; and &quot;Twisted Tales&quot;. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Farrell spoke of his mother&#x27;s suicide, saying, &quot;I remember it, yeah. There are some things that have deep-seated emotions for me, but you can&#x27;t change it and you move on. I think it has a huge part in my appreciation for life, for sure.&quot; He spent his grade-school years in Woodmere, Long Island, before his family relocated to Florida.

Farrell&#x27;s family moved to North Miami Beach, Florida when he was a teenager. At the age of seventeen, after graduating from high school, Farrell wanted adventure in his life and caught a bus to California. Aside from some belongings, Farrell took a surfboard, art materials and some marijuana. He stated in interviews since that he really wanted to focus on surfing, but had at that point in his life also started taking an interest in music with influences from The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Sly and the Family Stone and James Brown.

He spent time as a club singer for a short period in the early 1980s while living in Los Angeles. Farrell also stated that he worked construction, waited tables and spent some of his time in LA living in his car. While living in California, he began listening to David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Lou Reed.

==Music career==

===1981–1991: Psi Com and founding Jane&#x27;s Addiction===
In the early 1980s, Farrell was living in LA and noticed an ad in a local magazine. It had been placed by Vince Duran and Aaron Sherer, who were looking for a drummer for their band. Following discussions, it was agreed Farrell would become the lead singer and frontman for the post-punk, goth rock band, Psi Com. At the time, they mixed with a number of upcoming bands from California, including X, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Fishbone, Oingo Boingo, and the Minutemen. While performing with Psi Com, it was the first time the pseudonym Perry Farrell was used by Bernstein, since it was a play on the word &quot;peripheral&quot;.

Despite being together for over three years, the band only released a small batch of cassettes called &quot;Worktape 1&quot;. In 1985, they attempted to record more music at Radio Tokyo Studios in Venice Beach, California, with Ethan James responsible for a lot of the production. Problems with distribution meant the new tracks weren&#x27;t released while the band was together, but later released by Triple X in the 1990s after demand to hear the tracks grew.

Psi Com finally ended recording and playing together in late 1985. Farrell had previously met guitarist Eric Avery through mutual friends. Avery was classmates with both drummer Stephen Perkins and Dave Navarro. Avery and Farrell decided to jam together, forming the initial foundation for Jane&#x27;s Addiction. Perkins was invited to join, followed by Navarro.

Jane&#x27;s Addiction became popular in the mid-1980s, starting in LA but soon becoming a household name across the United States. They built a rabid fan base with high-energy shows in small venues across Los Angeles. The band released three albums in quick succession, &quot;Jane&#x27;s Addiction&quot;, &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot; and &quot;Ritual de lo Habitual&quot;. A B-sides album from the &quot;Ritual&quot; sessions, titled &quot;Live and Rare,&quot; was released in Japan. In late 1991, Jane&#x27;s Addiction announced they were splitting. Numerous reasons and rumours circulated including Farrell&#x27;s battle with addiction, but also many baseless rumors. Once the rumours died down, it became evident Farrell and Avery had different visions on the band&#x27;s progression.

===1992–1999: Porno for Pyros, solo music &amp; Jane&#x27;s Addiction reunion===
Shortly after Jane&#x27;s Addiction split up, Farrell and drummer Stephen Perkins formed Porno for Pyros. Guitarist Peter DiStefano and bass player Martyn LeNoble completed the original four members of the band. Porno for Pyros undertook a huge North American tour in 1992, prior to the release of their eponymous first album. The album was eventually released in 1993, with demand for new music from the band pushing the album to the No. 3 position on the Billboard top 200 list. The video for the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Pets&quot;, received heavy airplay on MTV. Following the album&#x27;s release, Porno for Pyros continued a heavy touring schedule, including an appearance at Woodstock &#x27;94 along with a cameo on HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;. Unlike the relatively straight-ahead rock shows that were the hallmark of live Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Porno for Pyros live shows relied heavily on props and special effects (including pyrotechnics).

In 1997, Jane&#x27;s Addiction reformed for a brief reunion tour with Flea replacing Avery on bass. Kicking off his solo career, Farrell released &quot;rev&quot; in 1999, a compilation featuring songs from his previous two bands as well as two new solo songs.

===2000–2008: Jane&#x27;s Addiction new music &amp; Satellite Party===
In 2001, he released his debut solo album, &quot;Song Yet to Be Sung&quot;, with lyrics inspired by Kabbalah. Farrell again toured with Jane&#x27;s Addiction later that year. He has been credited with changing the fortunes of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, after performing in 2001. Coachella&#x27;s first year in 1999 was considered a disaster, which led to the event not being held in 2000. In 2001, a decision was made to organize the festival again, but just a few months before the festival was set to occur, there was still no headlining group. Farrell, who was friends with the festival organizers, decided to reunite Jane&#x27;s Addiction for the 2001 event, which helped draw large crowds and allowed the festival to yield a profit (which was not the case in 1999). This began a Coachella tradition of reuniting at least one major act each year.

In 2003, Jane&#x27;s Addiction released an album, &quot;Strays&quot;. It quickly became one of their best selling records and was certified Gold in the USA and Silver in UK. They toured extensively in North America and Europe, brought back Lollapalooza for the first time since 1997, as well as performing at the Big Day Out festivals in Australia and New Zealand. Internal struggles saw the band split up again in early 2004. A &quot;best of&quot; release following the breakup of this incarnation of the band was released in 2006, titled &quot;Up from the Catacombs&quot;.

Farrell formed a new band/theatrical entity entitled the Satellite Party. Satellite Party is a concept album and is the story of a fictional band of musicians called the Solutionists who are trying to change the world. Farrell conceived the project with his wife Etty Lau Farrell. Etty sings and plays her part on the record as well as the live stage shows. Satellite Party made its debut in Los Angeles at The Key Club on July 18, 2005, followed by a performance at Lollapalooza 2005, held in Grant Park in downtown Chicago on July 24, 2005.

Their debut album, &quot;Ultra Payloaded&quot;, was released on May 29, 2007, on Columbia Records, with contributions from artists such as John Frusciante and Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, electronic dance producers Hybrid, former Red Hot Chili Peppers/Pearl Jam drummer Jack Irons, Joy Division/New Order bassist Peter Hook, and Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas.

Satellite Party performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 27, 2007. On June 8 they performed at the Download Festival at Donington, UK. On June 29 they performed alongside Pearl Jam, Kings of Leon and Queens of the Stone Age at Rock Werchter, Belgium. They performed at Buzz Beach Ball 3 in Kansas City (a concert sponsored by KRBZ), and EndFest 16 in Seattle.

The four original members of Jane&#x27;s Addiction played their first show together in 17 years at the first United States edition of the NME Awards on April 23, 2008, and played two small shows in Los Angeles during late 2008. Farrell has released a number of solo tracks online, all of them recorded with the involvement of wife Etty Lau. Their song &quot;Go All the Way (Into the Twilight)&quot; appeared on the &quot;Twilight&quot; film soundtrack.

===2009–present: Recent career &amp; Kind Heaven Orchestra===
The reunited Jane&#x27;s Addiction re-debuted at SXSW in 2009 and kicked off a summer tour with Nine Inch Nails. Eric Avery again left the band in late 2009, leaving Farrell, Navarro and Perkins as the remaining members of Jane&#x27;s Addiction. The band with Dave Sitek on bass released &quot;The Great Escape Artist&quot; in 2011 and have continued to tour.

In 2018, Farrell announced that he would be the frontman for a new music project, the Kind Heaven Orchestra. Farrell&#x27;s wife Etty Farrell was on backing vocals, Matt Chamberlain of Pearl Jam, Chris Cheney and keyboardist Matt Rohde from Jane&#x27;s Addiction also part of the lineup. Kind Heaven Orchestra debuted at the first ever Bill Graham Festival of Lights.

In October 2018, Farrell signed with BMG Rights Management, which released his second studio album &quot;Kind Heaven&quot; in 2019. The demand for new music by Farrell led to the album reaching 2nd position in the Heatseekers album chart. Metacritic gave the album an aggregate score of 70, meaning the album generally received positive reviews.

In 2020, Jane&#x27;s Addiction reformed after a three year hiatus to perform at Lollapalooza that year. When asked if we could expect a new album from Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Farrell stated “I wouldn&#x27;t think albums, I&#x27;d think songs. We’ve got so much Jane&#x27;s material in the can. We&#x27;ll be releasing a couple of tracks, maybe writing some new ones.&quot;

In February 2022, Farrell launched Heaven After Dark; each event combines music and sensation, visual stimulation, and supports the nurture of up-and-coming artists. Later that year, Heaven After Dark expanded to become its own record label where artists are treated more fairly than traditional models. The label has since gone on to release “Turn Over The World” (Idles remix), Etty Lau Farrell’s &quot;He’s A Rebel” Pink Panda Remix (The Crystal&#x27;s number 1 single), Telling Stories &amp; Until The Night Fades which was a collaboration between Etty Lau Farrell and award-winning English producer and DJ Hyper in 2023.

In May 2022, Farrell announced he would be releasing a new single titled Mend, with Kind Heaven Orchestra. During the same month, Jane&#x27;s Addiction had to pull out of performing at Welcome to Rockville after Dave Navarro contracted Covid-19. Farrell said on Welcome to Rockville&#x27;s Facebook page that Porno for Pyros would be reuniting for the first time in 26 years.
On September 13, 2024, a concert of Jane&#x27;s Addiction at Leader Bank Pavilion in Boston was cut short after Farrell shoved and punched Navarro and was restrained by the crew members. Farrell&#x27;s wife, Etty Lau Farrell, said Farrell had been suffering from tinnitus and a sore throat and felt his voice was being drowned out by the band. Farrell allegedly assaulted Navarro a second time backstage. The following day, Jane&#x27;s Addiction issued an apology and canceled their scheduled show at Bridgeport, Connecticut. On September 16, they canceled the remainder of the tour and said they would &quot;take some time away as a group&quot;. Navarro, Avery and Perkins released a joint statement attributing the cancellation to Farrell&#x27;s behavior and mental health, while Farrell released an apology, saying his behavior was &quot;inexcusable&quot;. The band later announced in January 2025 that they would be continuing without Farrell.

==Lollapalooza==
In 1991, Farrell created Lollapalooza, initially as the farewell tour for Jane&#x27;s Addiction. It has since become a defining cultural event for alternative music enthusiasts worldwide, showcasing diverse talents and fostering a global community of music and art lovers. Lollapalooza has also become a platform for social change, encouraging activism and environmental consciousness. The festival has since expanded into eight territories around the world including Chicago, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Germany, France, Sweden and India.

===Kidzapalooza===
In 2005, music producer Tor Hyams approached Farrell with the idea of creating a kids&#x27; stage with family-friendly fare at Lollapalooza. Kidzapalooza came to be that year, produced by Hyams and continues to this day with guests like Slash, Patti Smith and LeAnn Rimes appearing in the lineup of artists.

===PurimPalooza 2006===
In 2006, Farrell performed at Purimpalooza, which celebrates the Jewish holiday of Purim. It was a concert for all ages and presented different Jewish musical groups. It took place in Ruby Skye in San Francisco, and featured bands including Moshav, Chutzpah, and Matisyahu.

==Work outside music==
Farrell has also made a docudrama titled &quot;Gift&quot; released in 1993 which featured various songs by Farrell and included Farrell&#x27;s then-girlfriend Casey Niccoli. Gift was released to VHS home video by Warner Bros but never released to DVD.

He joined forces with Tom Morello and his Axis of Justice tour to raise money for the homeless in Los Angeles and together they both physically removed debris in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina to assist local musicians. They also fund-raised for &quot;Road Recovery&quot; a New York non-profit organization which helps young people battling with addiction and other adversities.

Farrell is an environmentalist. He met British prime minister Tony Blair at 10 Downing Street on January 31, 2007, to discuss global warming. He presented Blair with a CD of the Satellite Party track &quot;Woman in the Window&quot;.

He worked with Global Cool in 2007 to help promote green living.

Farrell has worked to bring music festivals to Israel, including Lollapalooza, and Jane&#x27;s Addiction themselves have performed in Israel. &quot;Lollapalooza Israel&quot; was to take place in Tel Aviv’s Yarkon Park on August 20-22, 2013. However, the event fell through, with the organizers citing financial concerns and lack of talent willing to perform in Israel. In 2009, Farrell sang at a &quot;benefit for victims of terror and a solidarity event for Israel&quot;, an invitation-only party named &quot;Stand with Israel&quot; and held at 7 World Trade Center (which is by Ground Zero in New York City), alongside Alan Dershowitz and Jared Kushner.

==Personal life==
Farrell met his wife, Etty Lau Farrell, while touring with Jane&#x27;s Addiction; she was a backing dancer on the tour in 1997. They married in 2002. Farrell has three children, two with his wife and one from a previous relationship.

<text>The festival and spa town of Bad Hersfeld (&quot;Bad&quot; is &quot;spa&quot; in German; the Old High German name of the city was &quot;Herolfisfeld&quot;) is the district seat of the Hersfeld-Rotenburg district in northeastern Hesse, Germany, roughly 50 km southeast of Kassel.

Bad Hersfeld is known countrywide above all for the &quot;Bad Hersfelder Festspiele&quot; (festival), which have taken place each year since 1951 at the monastery ruins. These themselves are said to be Europe&#x27;s biggest Romanesque church ruin.

In 1967, the town hosted the seventh &quot;Hessentag&quot; state festival.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The town lies in the Hersfeld Basin formed here by the forks of the Fulda and the Haune. The inner town lies on the Fulda&#x27;s left bank. Furthermore, the Geisbach and the Solz empty into the Fulda in the municipal area. In the southwest lie the Vogelsberg Mountains, in the northwest the Knüll and in the northeast the Seulingswald (ranges, the latter visible in the background of this image).

The town&#x27;s lowest point, at 195 m above sea level, is to be found in the area where the Solz empties into the Fulda, whereas the highest point within town limits is the Laxberg in the Knüllgebirge, at 408 m above sea level.

The town can be said to belong both to Northern Hesse (&quot;Nordhessen&quot;) and Eastern Hesse (&quot;Osthessen&quot;).

The nearest cities are Kassel, 52 km to the north, Gießen, 79 km to the southwest, Fulda, 36 km to the south and Eisenach, 45 km to the east. Through Bad Hersfeld runs the &quot;Deutsche Fachwerkstraße&quot; (&quot;German Timber Frame Road&quot;), a holiday road that showcases many of Germany&#x27;s timber-frame houses and buildings.

=== Geology ===
The Old Town stands on an alluvial or fluvial fan made of gravel and pebbles, which were washed up between Fulda and Geisbach. Also in the Fulda valley are found gravel and pebbles from the Holocene that are mostly of alluvial origin. There are layers of flood-deposited loess and loam of Pleistocene origin running through them. The gravel and pebbles are to a great extent made up of Middle Bunter, the most widespread stone here. In the west and east, this layer reaches from the Germanic Triassic on the Stellerskuppe (480.5 m above sea level) and the Haukuppe (446.1 m above sea level) up to 400 m above sea level. In the east, on the Wippershainer Höhe (heights), the layer reaches up to 440 m above sea level. The Middle Bunter&#x27;s lower limit is found at about 110 m above sea level.

Newer mineral layers from the Triassic are found only in sporadic deposits and discontinuous layers within town limits. This is the Röt formation, which crops up in the headwaters of the many small brooks around the town. The Lower or Middle Muschelkalk that overlies it can only be found in a narrow, west-to-east running rift stretching between Heenes and Oberrode, north of the inner town. The newest mineral layer from the Triassic – the Lower Keuper (for example the so-called &quot;Lettenkohlensandstein&quot;) – is only preserved in the region under a lava flow, which does not show itself above ground anywhere near the town.

Owing to uplift in the Jurassic and Cretaceous, there are no mineral layers from these geological time periods. Volcanic rock from the Miocene can be found on the Haukuppe.

Mineral layers that do not reach the surface here are the Lower Bunter, running from a depth of some 90 m underneath the town (about 110 m above sea level) down to some 390 m farther down, and, following at yet greater depths, Upper and Lower Zechstein from the Permian. From this layer come the two mineral springs in Bad Hersfeld. This layer is also used in underground mining from the 400-metre level on down on the Werra (Heringen, Philippsthal) and on the Fulda (Neuhof bei Fulda), yielding potash.

=== Municipal area’s extent ===
Today&#x27;s main town spreads over the slopes of the Tageberg (323.5 m above sea level), the Frauenberg (310 m), the Wehneberg (320 m) and the Wendeberg (291 m), further reaching into the valleys of the Meisebach and the Geisbach. From southwest to northeast it stretches some 4.5 km, and from northeast to southwest some 3.5 km.

The Old Town in the Fulda valley has an oval shape and an area of some 40 ha. From west to east it stretches some 960 m and from south to north some 570 m. This can still clearly be seen today, as where the town moat once led around the town there is today a ringroad that leads traffic around it.
=== Constituent communities ===
Besides the main town – also called Bad Hersfeld – the town also has the outlying centres of Allmershausen, Asbach, Beiershausen, Eichhof, Heenes, Hohe Luft, Johannesberg, Kathus, Kohlhausen, Petersberg and Sorga.

Further subdivisions in the main town are not officially &quot;Stadtteile&quot;. The Old Town itself is divided into the &quot;Stiftsbezirk&quot; (&quot;Monastery Zone&quot;) and the &quot;Unterstadt&quot; (&quot;Lower Town&quot;) to the east. Between the two lies the oldest part of the Old Town. The spa is centred in a spot west of the &quot;Stiftsbezirk&quot; and is considered part of the main town. Furthermore, there are Kalkobes (a village that was amalgamated by the turn of the 20th century), Wehneberg (which arose from a lordly estate), Zellersgrund, Oberrode (an agricultural operation), Hof Hählgans (likewise an agricultural operation) and Mönches (now forsaken; a former forester&#x27;s house stands here).

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Clockwise from the north, these are Ludwigsau, Friedewald, Schenklengsfeld, Hauneck, Niederaula, Kirchheim and Neuenstein.

=== Climate ===
The town&#x27;s sheltered location in the Fulda valley with the surrounding Hessian and Thuringian low mountain ranges leads to a relatively high average yearly temperature in Bad Hersfeld of 8.7 °C and a rather dry climate with yearly precipitation averaging only 718.1 mm. The average yearly sunshine, therefore, is quite high at 1,385.4 hours. On average over the year, Bad Hersfeld has 34 &quot;summer days&quot; (that is, with temperatures reaching 25 °C or higher), 86 &quot;frost days&quot; (with the day&#x27;s lowest temperature below 0 °C) and 22 &quot;ice days&quot; (with the day&#x27;s temperature never rising above 0 °C).

== History ==

Bad Hersfeld&#x27;s written history begins with the monk Sturm, who established a monastic settlement in &quot;Haerulfisfeld&quot; but later evacuated it to Fulda, and with Lullus, who reëstablished the Benedictine Hersfeld Abbey in 769. Both had been missionary bishop Boniface&#x27;s disciples. The monastery was enlarged between 831 and 850 and Lullus&#x27;s remains were moved in 852 to another grave in the new basilica. During this ceremony his canonisation was announced by Rabanus Maurus. Since 852, the &quot;Lullusfest&quot;, the oldest folk festival in Germany, has been celebrated in the week of Saint Lullus&#x27;s day, 16 October (his day of death). Martin Luther visited the monastery, on his way back from the Diet of Worms in 1521 and held a sermon in the abbey church on 1 May. About two years later, the town and the territory of the abbey was mostly Protestant.

It has been shown, however, through archaeological digs that today&#x27;s townsite has a considerably longer settlement history, with traces of habitation going back to the New Stone Age about 2000 BC; a Bronze Age grave from about 1200 BC has also been unearthed, as have finds from La Tène times about 400 BC.

Hersfeld was first mentioned as a market centre in 1142 and as a town in 1170. At this time also came the Hersfeld Abbey&#x27;s greatest importance in Imperial politics. In the centuries that followed, the Abbey&#x27;s might ebbed as after the Great Interregnum (1254–1273) it could no longer enjoy the Holy Roman Emperor’s support. Beginning in 1373, the Landgraviate of Hesse acquired influence over the town through defensive alliances. On &quot;Vitalisnacht&quot; (Saint Vitalis’s night, 27–28 April) 1378, the power struggle between the Abbey and the town reached its high point. Because of the German Peasants&#x27; War in 1525, great parts of the town and the Abbey passed to Hesse. In 1606, the last abbot died and in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, the Imperial Abbey, raised to Electorate, was awarded to the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. Hersfeld, now a worldly electorate, henceforth belonged to Hesse-Kassel.

In 1439, great parts of the town were destroyed by fire. The oldest timber-frame house in town is the &quot;Küsterhaus&quot; (Sexton’s House&quot;) from 1452. Abbot Ludwig V (1571–1588) brought the town its last building boom for centuries in which he had the Abbey&#x27;s buildings expanded and converted in the &quot;Weser Renaissance&quot; style. These can still be seen throughout the Old Town, for instance the former mint and the &quot;Schloss Eichhof&quot; (palatial castle).

During the Seven Years&#x27; War the French army used the former abbey church as a supply and food depot. In 1761, the French burnt the church and the monastery buildings down to destroy their supplies during their retreat, thus destroying one of the largest churches in Germany, and in 1807, the town was almost utterly destroyed by Napoleonic occupation troops, but was spared when it turned out that Baden Lieutenant Colonel Johann Baptist Lingg von Linggenfeld would only carry out Napoleon&#x27;s orders &quot;literally&quot;: he was supposed to set fire to the town on all four sides, and this he did by having four buildings, each standing away from others, set on fire.
During the American Revolution King George III of Great Britain hired the Musketeer Regiment Prinz Carl along with other regiments from Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse. The Musketeer Regiment Prinz Carl was stationed both before and after their return from America at Hersfeld.

In 1821, Hersfeld became the seat of Hersfeld district in the Electorate of Hesse. In the same century, Hersfeld was linked to the railway network in 1866, and the town has also had an Autobahn link since 1938 (today Bundesautobahn 7) northwards via Kassel and Hamburg to Scandinavia and southwards via Kirchheim, Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria to Austria. The Bundesautobahn 4 coming from Kirchheim links eastwards via Dresden and Görlitz to Poland. The development into a spa town began when the Lullusbrunnen (spring) was tapped in 1904.

In 1935 the barracks was built in the outskirts of Hersfeld (today Hohe Luft), by the Wehrmacht. In 1945, Hersfeld was once again spared utter destruction, when two officers who had been taken prisoner guaranteed the town&#x27;s peaceful handover.

The United States Army took over the Wehrmacht&#x27;s barracks. Between 1948 and 1993 it was the McPheeters Barracks. Here served the 3rd Squadron, 14th Armored Cavalry Regiment (1948 until 1972) and 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (1972 until 1993) at the Inner German border. About 800 American soldiers manned the barracks and its three observation posts, designated OP Romeo, OP India and OP Oscar. They also conducted two patrols daily along the border trace. The Americans had no interest in civilians crossing the border. Theirs was a tactical mission to halt possible Warsaw Pact aggression. Bad Hersfeld lies in the Fulda Gap, a historical avenue used for armies of the past. Bad Hersfeld was the northernmost American border garrison and the first line of defense during the days of the Cold War. While small in numbers, the US forces were heavily equipped with a nuclear capability. They were primarily equipped with armored personnel carriers, artillery, and main battle tanks. They were augmented with combat engineers and an anti-aircraft missile site. However, they patrolled the Russian-American Demarcation Line in pairs of jeeps to avoid damage to the roads.
Beginning in 1949, the town was called Bad Hersfeld, and as of 1963 it became a Hessian State Spa, which was municipalized in 2006. (&quot;Bad&quot; is German for &quot;bath&quot;, and is a title given towns by state governments in recognition of their spa status).

In May 1983, 5,000 people in the town demonstrated against a reunion of soldiers from the Waffen-SS. Among the protest organizers were also the organizers of the &quot;Bad Hersfelder Festspiele&quot;.

=== Religion ===
The area of the town of Bad Hersfeld today belongs to the &quot;Evangelische Kirche von Kurhessen-Waldeck&quot; (&quot;Protestant Church of the Electorate of Hesse-Waldeck&quot;, member of the Protestant Church in Germany), and the largely coextensive Catholic Bishopric of Fulda.

Besides the two big churches, various communities and free churches can be found in Bad Hersfeld, among them the State Church Community, the Protestant Free Church Community (Baptists), the Seventh Day Adventists and the Free Christian Community (Pentecostal).

Further religious communities in Bad Hersfeld are the New Apostolic Church and the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

=== Amalgamations ===
In 1918, Kalkobes was amalgamated and in 1928 so was the area that later became the outlying centre od Johannesberg (&quot;Domäne Johannesberg und Bingartes&quot;). In 1972, the centres named above under &quot;Constituent communities&quot; were amalgamated. Moreover, the districts of Hersfeld and Rotenburg were merged into one new district, Hersfeld-Rotenburg, and Bad Hersfeld became its seat.

=== Population development ===
In 1525, 400 men lived in the town, and presumably this meant only householders – men with townsman&#x27;s rights. Before the Thirty Years&#x27; War, in 1614, there were 725 households, putting the town&#x27;s population at this time somewhere between 3,300 and 3,600. The town only reached this figure once again in the mid-18th century. The leftmost chart below shows the sharp drop in the town&#x27;s population due to the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

After the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the population figure rose only slowly, falling back in the wake of many wars, disease outbreaks and famines. Only beginning in the mid-19th century, as the town was spreading outside to old town walls and as the textile and machine building industries were growing did the population figure rise sharply. Between 1910 and 1913, it surpassed 10,000 and after the Second World War, sometime between 1946 and 1950, it reached the 20,000 mark. After eleven villages were amalgamated in 1972, the population reached some 27,000, and sometime between 1987 and 1994, the town&#x27;s population reached 30,000.

Given the population structure and the forecast migration to urban agglomerations, the HA Hessen Agentur GmbH foresees that the district&#x27;s population will shrink by 6% by 2020. This fall is therefore also foreseen within the same timeframe for the town.

== Politics ==
=== Town council ===
The municipal election held on 26 March 2006 yielded the following results:

The SPD and the FWG form one faction in the current election period.

The executive (&quot;Magistrat&quot;) is made up of 7 councillors and the mayor. Three seats are allotted to the SPD, two to the CDU and one each to the FDP and FWG.

=== Mayor ===
*Werner Hessemer: 1963-1977
*Hartmut Henning Boehmer: 1978-1989
*Walter Weiss: 1990-1996
*Hartmut Henning Boehmer: 1996-2010
*Thomas Fehling: 2011–2022
*Anke Hofmann: 2022–

===Coat of arms===

The town&#x27;s arms might be described thus: Party per pale azure the Lion of Hesse sinister armed Or and royally crowned, argent a Cross of Lorraine pattée gules, the bottom arm fleury.

The arms used today have been borne since 1559. The &quot;double cross&quot; stems from the Benedictine abbey of Hersfeld. The Lion of Hesse appeared in the town&#x27;s arms after the conquest in the Peasants’ War from Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse in 1525.

====Older coats of arms====
The oldest known town seal, from 1256, shows the patron saint Wigbert. The smaller seal from the 14th century shows the patron Simon the Zealot and Jude the Apostle of the Benedictine abbey of Hersfeld with the Wheel of Mainz and the double cross. In the Late Gothic town seal, this cross was the only charge. At Philip I&#x27;s conquest, it was displaced by the Lion of Hesse.

A stylized double cross also appears in the Bad Hersfeld town logo designed in 2008. It is supposed to be used for marketing and the Internet.

===Sponsorships===
*Already by 1954, the town had undertaken a sponsorship for Sudeten Germans driven out of Šumperk – formerly Mährisch-Schönberg – in Moravia.
*A sponsorship with the German Navy Fast Attack Craft &quot;S 75 Zobel&quot; has existed since 1969.

== Culture and sightseeing ==
The town has since 1962 yearly awarded the &quot;Hersfeld-Preis&quot; to actors of the current festival season. Another honour awarded by the town is the &quot;Ulenroder Kruzifix&quot;, a cast taken of a bronze crucifix from the early 11th century that was found in the abandoned village of Ulenrode, which lay above Meckbach in what is now the community of Ludwigsau.

=== Theatre ===
Every summer, the &quot;Bad Hersfelder Festspiele&quot; (festival) are held. Outside the festival season, theatrical productions are given in the &quot;Stadthalle&quot;, an event venue.

=== Museums ===
The Bad Hersfeld Town Museum is housed in the only wing of the former monastery complex that is still preserved, south of the monastery ruins themselves. Besides the departments for town and monastery history, the department for town handicrafts is also worthy of mention.

In Konrad Duden’s memory is a small museum right next door to the former Old Monastery School (on the New Market). Here Duden was active from 1876 to 1905 as principal, which is why the school now bears his name.

The &quot;Haus Mährisch Schönberg&quot; shows a local history collection from the formerly German district of Landkreis Mährisch-Schönberg in what was the Sudetenland (on the New Market).

Since 2006 there has been a small savings bank museum at the main branch of the &quot;Sparkasse Bad Hersfeld-Rotenburg&quot; in which is displayed the history of the financial institution and the changes in the banking world in a great number of exhibits.

=== Buildings ===

In the Old Town are 216 buildings under monumental protection. On the west side of the Old Town are found the monastery ruins. They are Europe’s biggest ecclesiastical ruin, and are now used as a venue for the &quot;Bad Hersfelder Festspiele&quot;. In the monastery zone stands the Katharinenturm (tower), in which hangs the &quot;Lullusglocke&quot;, Germany’s oldest dated bell (cast in 1038 AD). Furthermore, a wing of the cloister has been preserved (today a museum; chapter house preserved) and likewise great parts of the remnants of the town wall (South Gate, &quot;Halbschalenturm&quot; or &quot;Half-Shell Tower&quot;). The two &quot;Nordschulteiche&quot; (ponds) in the Leonhard Müller Complex are leftovers of the town moat. In this park is also found Saint Vitalis&#x27;s Cross (the original can be seen in the museum). It stands on the spot where the townsmen fought off the attack by the &quot;Sternerbund&quot; in 1378. Further remnants of the town fortifications stand in the Lower Town (east side of the Old Town), among them the &quot;Klausturm&quot; (a watchtower and prison) and the somewhat smaller &quot;Pulverturm&quot; (&quot;Powder Tower&quot;)

Furthermore, on Johannestor (a street) is found the &quot;Elisabeth-Hospital&quot;, endowed in 1239, with a Gothic chapel. Other Abbey buildings are the Schloss Eichhof and the ruins – the &quot;Bruderhaus&quot; – of the former Johannesberg provost&#x27;s house. Both buildings lie some 3 km from the Old Town and can also be reached on foot from the spa park.
In the centre of Bad Hersfeld&#x27;s Old Town stands the Gothic &quot;Stadtkirche&quot; (&quot;Town Church&quot;) whose 14th-century tower is the town&#x27;s landmark. On the church square stands a continuous row of timber-frame buildings, among them the former &quot;Küsterhaus&quot; (sexton&#x27;s house), which is the town&#x27;s oldest timber-frame house, built in 1452. Right next to this stands the Town Hall, which was built about 1371 in the Gothic style and remodelled and expanded between 1607 and 1612 in the Weser Renaissance style. Further timber-frame houses are to be found throughout the pedestrian precinct. Particularly worthy of mention here is the richly decorated &quot;Zimmermannshaus&quot; (&quot;Carpenter’s House&quot;) on Klausstraße.

On Linggplatz, the Abbey&#x27;s old court square (old stone &quot;double cross&quot;), a statue recalls Baden Lieutenant Colonel Johann Baptist Lingg von Linggenfeld, who saved the town from being burnt down by Napoleonic troops in 1807. Beside this lies the marketplace on which patrician houses from Gothic times stand, among them the old mint. They were remodelled in the Renaissance and bear witness, with their gables like the timber-frame houses across the street, to the monastery&#x27;s last building boom. On the &quot;Neumarkt&quot; (&quot;New Market&quot;) stands, besides the other timber-frame houses, the &quot;Linggklause&quot; (Lieutenant Colonel Lingg&#x27;s dwelling). Here, too, are the old monastery school (nowadays the &quot;Konrad-Duden-Schule&quot;) and the Konrad Duden Museum.

=== Parks ===
The biggest park in town is the &quot;Kurpark&quot;, or spa park (some 6.5 ha) with the &quot;Kurhaus&quot; (spa house), the pump room and the spring pavilion. Right near the Old Town is found the &quot;Leonardt-Müller-Anlage&quot; (park), along the town wall, with the two &quot;Nordschulteiche&quot; (ponds). In the monastery zone is another park, which in 2006 was expanded with a perennial plant garden. Both the spa park and the &quot;Leonardt-Müller-Anlage&quot; were remodelled between 2006 and 2007.

Further greenspaces are the 15-hectare Fuldapark with its Fuldasee (lake) and the &quot;Carl-Strauß-Anlage&quot; on the Kleinshöhe (heights) on the Tageberg.

=== Sport ===
*Besides the football clubs in many centres, there is the SVA Bad Hersfeld club, which with its first team is playing in the Fußball-Verbandsliga Hessen Nord in the 2008/2009 season. The second team plays in the Bezirksliga Fulda Nord, and the A-Juniors belong, for the third year now, to the Hyundai Oberliga Hessen. Further ball sports are played at the Turnverein Hersfeld 1848 e. V. (gymnastic club). Among others, there are team handball, volleyball and basketball.
*The team of the SG Hessen Hersfeld played from the 1997/1998 season until the 2002/2003 season in the women&#x27;s Handball-Bundesliga.
*The three rowing and canoe clubs, Hersfelder Kanu-Club 1924 e. V., Kanu-Wanderer Hersfeld 1986 e. V. and Hersfelder Ruderverein 1977 e. V. carry out their activity in the summer, mainly on the Fulda. The last-named club also engages in competitive rowing.
*Besides the shooting clubs in almost every outlying centre, there is also the Hersfelder Schützengilde (&quot;Marksmen’s Guild&quot;) 1252 e. V. It is one of Germany&#x27;s oldest still-active clubs.
*The Luftsportverein Bad Hersfeld e. V. (air sports) has its glider facility on the Langenberg near Hattenbach (a constituent community of Niederaula).
*the famous &quot;Zu-Null-Bickel&quot; lives in Bad Hersfeld.

=== Regular events ===
Nationally known are the yearly &quot;Bad Hersfelder Festspiele&quot;, opera festival and the festival concerts. They are held between June and August in the monastery ruins. Other great musical events for every taste is the Bad Hersfeld Bach Days event (every year at Easter at the Johann-Sebastian-Bach-Haus), the Live-Jazz-Festival (every year on the first weekend in June on stages throughout the Old Town), the &quot;StadtJugendNacht&quot; (&quot;Town Youth Night&quot;; yearly on the first Saturday in September under the &quot;Peterstorbrücke&quot; [bridge]) and the &quot;Metalfest&quot; (late every year).

The &quot;Lullusfest&quot; is known for being Germany&#x27;s oldest folk festival. It is held every year in the week in which 16 October falls. Other greater folk festivals are the shooting festival of the marksmen&#x27;s guild in the Jägersgraben and the Tagebergfest of the volunteer fire brigade (an outdoor forest festival).

Among sporting events that can be named are the &quot;Sauer Lollslauf&quot;, a marathon run on the occasion of the &quot;Lullusfest&quot;, and the &quot;Internationale Bad Hersfelder DMV-Grasbahnrennen&quot; held each summer by the Motorsportclub Bad Hersfeld e. V. on a 500 m-long track.

Most markets in town are held on Linggplatz. The weekly market is held twice a week and a flea market takes place from April to October on the first Saturday of each month. Other, yearly, markets are the Easter Market on Wednesday before Good Friday, the Whitsun Market on Wednesday before Whitsunday, the &quot;Große Lulluskrammarkt&quot; (&quot;Great Lullus Traders’ Market&quot;) on Wednesday during &quot;Lullusfest&quot; and the Autumn Market on Penance Day, the Wednesday before 23 November (this day is known in Germany as &quot;Buß- und Bettag&quot;, an Evangelical observance).

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Since German reunification Bad Hersfeld has lain in the middle of Germany, favourably located on the A 4 and the A 7, leading the region to develop into a stronghold for logistics firms.

The town appears in Hesse&#x27;s state development plan as a middle centre partly functioning as a higher centre. The town maintains a large volunteer fire brigade, which sometimes sees service elsewhere in Germany.

=== Transport ===

==== Highway ====
The north–south Autobahnen A 5 (Hattenbach–Basel) and A 7 (Flensburg–Füssen) meet the east-west Autobahn A 4 (Aachen–Görlitz) at the Kirchheim and Hattenbach three-leg interchanges.

Moreover, the north–south &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; 27 (from the Harz to Lake Constance) and the east–west &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; 62 (from Marburg to Bad Salzungen) play an important role. &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; 324 serves as an Autobahn feeder to the A 7. All three &quot;Bundesstraßen&quot; meet each other in Bad Hersfeld.

==== Railway ====

Bad Hersfeld lies on the Kassel–Bebra–Fulda railway line. There is an ICE connection every two hours from Frankfurt am Main by way of Fulda to Eisenach–Erfurt–Weimar–Leipzig–Berlin/Dresden. Regional trains run to, among other places, Kassel and Göttingen. Just behind Hersfeld railway station, the &quot;Knüllwaldbahn&quot; branches off.

==== Local public transport ====
The local public transport is run by the &quot;Nordhessischer Verkehrsverbund&quot; (&quot;North Hesse Transport Association&quot;, NVV). The nine town and four intercity bus routes are run by Überlandwerk Fulda AG (ÜWAG Bus GmbH).

The &quot;Hersfelder Kreisbahn&quot; run by the &quot;Hersfelder Eisenbahngesellschaft&quot;, a local railway line running from Bad Hersfeld to Philippsthal – roughly 11 km – was abandoned in 1993, and the stretch as far as Schenklengsfeld has been converted into a cycling path.

==== Air transport ====
The &quot;Flugplatz Johannesberg&quot; has the status of Special Airfield. The runway, some 671 m long and 18 m wide, is paved with asphalt and oriented in a north–south direction. The airfield lies on the Johannesberg in the like-named outlying centre at an elevation of 284 m above sea level.

The airfield was built by the United States Army between 1952 and 1953 and belonged to McPheeter Barracks in the outlying centre of Hohe Luft. It was known at that time as US Army Airfield Werve-Thompson. When the US Army pulled out in 1993, the airfield was taken over by Motor-Flieger-Club e. V. Bad Hersfeld.

=== Established businesses ===
Among businesses in the oldest field of endeavour in Bad Hersfeld, textile manufacturing, is the firm Performance Fibers (formerly the Hoechst works, which makes high-strength polyester fibres. Further long-established family businesses are the mineral oil dealer and operator of the LOMO filling stations Lorenz Mohr GmbH &amp; Co. KG and the building firm Kirchner Holding GmbH. Working in the field of electronics are EMS (Electronic Manufacturing Services) service provider EN ElectronicNetwork Hersfeld GmbH (formerly Zuse KG, later Siemens AG, and KRONE Kommunikationstechnik GmbH) and Thales e-Transactions GmbH. In the field of machine building and process engineering, the firms Grenzebach BSH GmbH (in Schilde AG&#x27;s old buildings), Linde Ladenbau GmbH &amp; Co. KG and TLT Turbo GmbH (since 2006 owned by Siemens AG) can be named. The logistics field settled here for the most part only after German reunification. After amazon.de and Libri, a book wholesaling firm, came the logistics firm RS Components, setting up its European hub in Bad Hersfeld.

A further important economic factor is the hospital establishment, which in part also supports the spa operations. The following hospitals and clinics are to be found in town: the &quot;Klinikum Bad Hersfeld&quot; and the &quot;Krankenhaus St. Elisabeth Bad Hersfeld&quot;, which are active mainly in general medicine, and the spa clinics &quot;Klinik im Kurpark&quot; (clinic for psychosomatic medicine and orthopaedics), &quot;Fachklinik Wigbertshöhe&quot; (clinic for sociopsychosomatic illnesses), &quot;Klinik am Hainberg&quot; (clinic for psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy), &quot;Vitalisklinik&quot; (clinic for digestive and metabolic disorders) and the &quot;Orthopädische Akutklinik&quot;.

The biggest bank in town is the &quot;Sparkasse Bad Hersfeld-Rotenburg&quot;.

=== Music ===
Each year after the &quot;Festspiele&quot;, an opera festival is held in the monastery ruins. Even during the time of the &quot;Festspiele&quot;, though, the &quot;Arbeitskreis für Musik e. V. &quot; (&quot;music workshop&quot;) has staged the &quot;Bad Hersfelder Festspielkonzerte&quot; in the monastery ruins, in the &quot;Stadthalle&quot; and at &quot;Johann-Sebastian-Bach-Haus&quot; since 1961. Furthermore, seasonal concerts are held the year round in the &quot;Stadthalle&quot; and at &quot;Johann-Sebastian-Bach-Haus&quot;. Among them are the &quot;Internationale Bachtage in Hessen und Thüringen&quot; at which each year during Holy Week and at Easter great choral works and chamber music extravaganzas are produced.

Also, each year on the first weekend in June is the jazz festival. National and international stars as well as groups from the town itself liven up the town the whole weekend long from morning until late evening with swing, beat and blues. For many years this festival has been a great yearly highlight, drawing many visitors from all over.

In autumn, the yearly &quot;Cross Music Metalfest&quot; is held, at which many hard rock and metal bands from all over the world appear. It is always held on the first weekend in October and draws visitors from all over Europe.

=== Media ===
The local daily newspaper is the &quot;Hersfelder Zeitung&quot; (founded in 1763) and the twice weekly advertising flier &quot;Kreisanzeiger&quot; has been distributed free since 1980. Both papers have belonged to the publishing business Dirk Ippen. Competition comes from an independent advertising flier published since August 2008, the &quot;Express Waldhessen&quot;. Since several months the &quot;Express Waldhessen&quot; has a new name. It&#x27;s called &quot;Klartext&quot;. In addition sind 2004 there is another small Newspaper made by Bodo Neumann. It&#x27;s called: &quot;EXTRABLATT&quot; which will be free distributed every 14 days.

Since 1 May 2008, FunRadio Hersfeld has been broadcasting from the town.

=== Public institutions ===
Besides the customary institutions usually found in a district seat, and those already described under &quot;Culture and sightseeing&quot;, there are the &quot;Stadthalle&quot; (literally &quot;town hall&quot;, but actually an event venue, not connected at all with the town&#x27;s administration; &quot;town hall&quot; is &quot;Rathaus&quot; in German), the book café (sponsor: Verein für Kultur und Kommunikation e. V.) and the &quot;Konrad-Duden-Stadtbibliothek&quot; (town library). This was opened in March 1999 on the marketplace in Bad Hersfeld. The public library has a total floor area of some 1 000 m2. On 31 December 2007, it had an inventory of some 65,000 media, and yearly media borrowings amount to 210,000.

In the field of sport, there are two baths, the Aqua Fit (sport and family bath) and the Kurbad Therme (wellness bath) at the spa park. Moreover, there is the heated swimming pool Geistalbad. Many other sports can be pursued at the Jahn-Park (sport and leisure centre), the Nordic-Walking-Park and the sport and tennis grounds in Bad Hersfeld.

==== Spa operations ====

In Bad Hersfeld are two mineral springs. The &quot;Lullusquelle&quot; was newly bored in 1904. It was documented as early as 1518, but was overwhelmed in a flood in the 17th century. The &quot;Vitalisbrunnen&quot; was bored in 1949. The water is heavy with Glauber&#x27;s salt. Bottled mineral water has also been available since 2006 under the name &quot;Naturquellen Bad Hersfeld&quot;.

The spa operations therefore primarily entail drinking and bathing treatments, which are used to deal with liver, gall bladder, stomach, intestinal and metabolic illnesses, as well as psychosomatic illnesses, musculoskeletal illnesses and rheumatic disorders. After spa privatization failed in 2005, the town once again took charge of the administration.

==== Youth ====
Besides the various football and sport clubs, youths also have a chance to meet each other after school in one of Bad Hersfeld&#x27;s supervised institutions for fostering the town&#x27;s youth. One possible choice is the &quot;Jugendhaus Bad Hersfeld&quot; on Dippelstraße, which is popular among youth mainly for its many events.

=== Education ===
In Bad Hersfeld are three comprehensive schools, &quot;Gesamtschule Geistal&quot;, &quot;Gesamtschule Obersberg&quot; and &quot;Konrad-Duden-Schule&quot;, the last-named of which was founded in 1570 by Abbot Michael of the Hersfeld Abbey as a monastery school. From 1876 to 1905, Konrad Duden was the principal at the then &quot;Königliches Gymnasium zu Hersfeld&quot;, which was named in his honour in 1980.

The pilot school &quot;Modellschule Obersberg&quot; offers a Gymnasium-type upper level.

Furthermore, there are six primary schools, &quot;Ernst-von-Harnack-Schule&quot;, &quot;Grundschule An der Sommerseite&quot;, &quot;Grundschule Sorga&quot;, &quot;Kolibri-Grundschule&quot;, &quot;Linggschule&quot; und &quot;Wilhelm-Neuhaus-Schule&quot;. There is also a special school, Friedrich-Fröbel-Schule.

Also, there are three vocational schools, &quot;Berufliche Schulen des Landkreises Hersfeld-Rotenburg&quot; (&quot;Europaschule&quot;), &quot;Berufsbildungszentrum Metall&quot; and &quot;Bildungszentrum für Handel und Dienstleistung&quot;.

Further training and higher education is to be had at the &quot;Studienakademie für Logistik&quot; (department of the &quot;Berufsakademie Nordhessen&quot;), the evening school for adults, the Academy of the DGUV (&quot;Deutsche Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung&quot;, or &quot;German Legal Accident Insurance&quot;), the &quot;Deutsche Angestellten Akademie&quot;, the &quot;Evangelische Jugendbildungsstätte Frauenberg&quot; (&quot;Evangelical Youth Education Centre&quot;, sponsored by the Evangelical Church of Electoral Hesse-Waldeck), the district folk high school and the Hersfeld-Rotenburg district music school.

<text>In chemistry, resonance, also called mesomerism, is a way of describing bonding in certain molecules or polyatomic ions by the combination of several contributing structures (or &quot;forms&quot;, also variously known as &quot;resonance structures&quot; or &quot;canonical structures&quot;) into a resonance hybrid (or &quot;hybrid structure&quot;) in valence bond theory. It has particular value for analyzing delocalized electrons where the bonding cannot be expressed by one single Lewis structure. The resonance hybrid is the accurate structure for a molecule or ion; it is an average of the theoretical (or hypothetical) contributing structures.

== Overview ==
Under the framework of valence bond theory, resonance is an extension of the idea that the bonding in a chemical species can be described by a Lewis structure. For many chemical species, a single Lewis structure, consisting of atoms obeying the octet rule, possibly bearing formal charges, and connected by bonds of positive integer order, is sufficient for describing the chemical bonding and rationalizing experimentally determined molecular properties like bond lengths, angles, and dipole moment. However, in some cases, more than one Lewis structure could be drawn, and experimental properties are inconsistent with any one structure. In order to address this type of situation, several contributing structures are considered together as an average, and the molecule is said to be represented by a resonance hybrid in which several Lewis structures are used collectively to describe its true structure. For instance, in NO2–, nitrite anion, the two N–O bond lengths are equal, even though no single Lewis structure has two N–O bonds with the same formal bond order. However, its measured structure is consistent with a description as a resonance hybrid of the two major contributing structures shown above: it has two &quot;equal&quot; N–O bonds of 125 pm, intermediate in length between a typical N–O single bond (145 pm in hydroxylamine, H2N–OH) and N–O double bond (115 pm in nitronium ion, [O=N=O]+). According to the contributing structures, each N–O bond is an average of a formal single and formal double bond, leading to a true bond order of 1.5. By virtue of this averaging, the Lewis description of the bonding in NO2– is reconciled with the experimental fact that the anion has equivalent N–O bonds.

The resonance hybrid represents the actual molecule as the &quot;average&quot; of the contributing structures, with bond lengths and partial charges taking on intermediate values compared to those expected for the individual Lewis structures of the contributors, were they to exist as &quot;real&quot; chemical entities. The contributing structures differ only in the &quot;formal&quot; apportionment of electrons to the atoms, and not in the actual physically and chemically significant electron or spin density. While contributing structures may differ in formal bond orders and in formal charge assignments, all contributing structures must have the same number of valence electrons and the same spin multiplicity.

Because electron delocalization lowers the potential energy of a system, any species represented by a resonance hybrid is more stable than any of the (hypothetical) contributing structures. Electron delocalization stabilizes a molecule because the electrons are more evenly spread out over the molecule, decreasing electron-electron repulsion. The difference in potential energy between the actual species and the (computed) energy of the contributing structure with the lowest potential energy is called the &quot;resonance energy&quot; or delocalization energy. The magnitude of the resonance energy depends on assumptions made about the hypothetical &quot;non-stabilized&quot; species and the computational methods used and does not represent a measurable physical quantity, although comparisons of resonance energies computed under similar assumptions and conditions may be chemically meaningful.

Molecules with an extended π system such as linear polyenes and polyaromatic compounds are well described by resonance hybrids as well as by delocalised orbitals in molecular orbital theory.

=== Resonance vs isomerism ===
Resonance is to be distinguished from isomerism. Isomers are molecules with the same chemical formula but are distinct chemical species with different arrangements of atomic nuclei in space. Resonance contributors of a molecule, on the other hand, can only differ in the way electrons are formally assigned to atoms in the Lewis structure &quot;depictions&quot; of the molecule. Specifically, when a molecular structure is said to be represented by a resonance hybrid, it does &quot;not&quot; mean that electrons of the molecule are &quot;resonating&quot; or shifting back and forth between several sets of positions, each one represented by a Lewis structure. Rather, it means that the set of contributing structures &quot;represents an intermediate structure&quot; (a weighted average of the contributors), with a single, well-defined geometry and distribution of electrons. It is incorrect to regard resonance hybrids as rapidly interconverting isomers, even though the term &quot;resonance&quot; might evoke such an image. (As described below, the term &quot;resonance&quot; originated as a classical physics analogy for a quantum mechanical phenomenon, so it should not be construed too literally.) Symbolically, the double headed arrow &lt;chem&gt;A&lt;-&gt;B&lt;/chem&gt; is used to indicate that A and B are contributing forms of a single chemical species (as opposed to an equilibrium arrow, e.g., &lt;chem&gt;A &lt;=&gt; B&lt;/chem&gt;; see below for details on usage).

A non-chemical analogy is illustrative: one can describe the characteristics of a real animal, the narwhal, in terms of the characteristics of two mythical creatures: the unicorn, a creature with a single horn on its head, and the leviathan, a large, whale-like creature. The narwhal is not a creature that goes back and forth between being a unicorn and being a leviathan, nor do the unicorn and leviathan have any physical existence outside the collective human imagination. Nevertheless, describing the narwhal in terms of these imaginary creatures provides a reasonably good description of its physical characteristics.

Due to confusion with the physical meaning of the word resonance, as no entities actually physically &quot;resonate&quot;, it has been suggested that the term resonance be abandoned in favor of &quot;delocalization&quot; and resonance energy abandoned in favor of &quot;delocalization energy&quot;. A resonance structure becomes a &quot;contributing structure&quot; and the resonance hybrid becomes the &quot;hybrid structure&quot;. The double headed arrows would be replaced by commas to illustrate a set of structures, as arrows of any type may suggest that a chemical change is taking place.

=== Representation in diagrams ===

In diagrams, contributing structures are typically separated by double-headed arrows (↔). The arrow should not be confused with the right and left pointing &quot;equilibrium arrow&quot; (). All structures together may be enclosed in large square brackets, to indicate they picture one single molecule or ion, not different species in a chemical equilibrium.

Alternatively to the use of contributing structures in diagrams, a hybrid structure can be used. In a hybrid structure, pi bonds that are involved in resonance are usually pictured as curves or dashed lines, indicating that these are partial rather than normal complete pi bonds. In benzene and other aromatic rings, the delocalized pi-electrons are sometimes pictured as a solid circle.
== History ==
The concept first appeared in 1899 in Johannes Thiele&#x27;s &quot;Partial Valence Hypothesis&quot; to explain the unusual stability of benzene which would not be expected from August Kekulé&#x27;s structure proposed in 1865 with alternating single and double bonds. Benzene undergoes substitution reactions, rather than addition reactions as typical for alkenes. He proposed that the carbon-carbon bond in benzene is intermediate of a single and double bond.

The resonance proposal also helped explain the number of isomers of benzene derivatives. For example, Kekulé&#x27;s structure would predict &quot;four&quot; dibromobenzene isomers, including two ortho isomers with the brominated carbon atoms joined by either a single or a double bond. In reality there are only three dibromobenzene isomers and only one is ortho, in agreement with the idea that there is only one type of carbon-carbon bond, intermediate between a single and a double bond.

The mechanism of resonance was introduced into quantum mechanics by Werner Heisenberg in 1926 in a discussion of the quantum states of the helium atom. He compared the structure of the helium atom with the classical system of resonating coupled harmonic oscillators. In the classical system, the coupling produces two modes, one of which is lower in frequency than either of the uncoupled vibrations; quantum mechanically, this lower frequency is interpreted as a lower energy. Linus Pauling used this mechanism to explain the partial valence of molecules in 1928, and developed it further in a series of papers in 1931-1933. The alternative term &quot;mesomerism&quot; popular in German and French publications with the same meaning was introduced by C. K. Ingold in 1938, but did not catch on in the English literature. The current concept of mesomeric effect has taken on a related but different meaning. The double headed arrow was introduced by the German chemist Fritz Arndt who preferred the German phrase &quot;zwischenstufe&quot; or &quot;intermediate stage&quot;.

Resonance theory dominated over competing Hückel method for two decades thanks to being relatively easier to understand for chemists without fundamental physics background, even if they couldn&#x27;t grasp the concept of quantum superposition and confused it with tautomerism. Pauling and Wheland themselves characterized Erich Hückel&#x27;s approach as &quot;cumbersome&quot; at the time, and his lack of communication skills contributed: when Robert Robinson sent him a friendly request, he responded arrogantly that he is not interested in organic chemistry.

In the Soviet Union, resonance theory – especially as developed by Pauling – was attacked in the early 1950s as being contrary to the Marxist principles of dialectical materialism, and in June 1951 the Soviet Academy of Sciences under the leadership of Alexander Nesmeyanov convened a conference on the chemical structure of organic compounds, attended by 400 physicists, chemists, and philosophers, where &quot;the pseudo-scientific essence of the theory of resonance was exposed and unmasked&quot;.

== Major and minor contributors ==

One contributing structure may resemble the actual molecule more than another (in the sense of energy and stability). Structures with a low value of potential energy are more stable than those with high values and resemble the actual structure more. The most stable contributing structures are called &quot;major contributors&quot;. Energetically unfavourable and therefore less favorable structures are &quot;minor contributors&quot;. With rules listed in rough order of diminishing importance, major contributors are generally structures that

# obey as much as possible the octet rule (8 valence electrons around each atom rather than having deficiencies or surplus, or 2 electrons for Period 1 elements);
# have a maximum number of covalent bonds;
# carry a minimum of formally charged atoms, with the separation for unlike and like charges minimized and maximized, respectively;
# place negative charge, if any, on the most electronegative atoms and positive charge, if any, on the most electropositive;
# do not deviate substantially from idealized bond lengths and angles (e.g., the relative unimportance of Dewar-type resonance contributors for benzene);
# maintain aromatic substructures locally while avoiding anti-aromatic ones (&quot;see&quot; Clar sextet &quot;and&quot; biphenylene).

A maximum of eight valence electrons is strict for the Period 2 elements Be, B, C, N, O, and F, as is a maximum of two for H and He and effectively for Li as well. The issue of expansion of the valence shell of third period and heavier main group elements is controversial. A Lewis structure in which a central atom has a valence electron count greater than eight traditionally implies the participation of d orbitals in bonding. However, the consensus opinion is that while they may make a marginal contribution, the participation of d orbitals is unimportant, and the bonding of so-called hypervalent molecules are, for the most part, better explained by charge-separated contributing forms that depict three-center four-electron bonding. Nevertheless, by tradition, expanded octet structures are still commonly drawn for functional groups like sulfoxides, sulfones, and phosphorus ylides, for example. Regarded as a formalism that does not necessarily reflect the true electronic structure, such depictions are preferred by the IUPAC over structures featuring partial bonds, charge separation, or dative bonds.

Equivalent contributors contribute equally to the actual structure, while the importance of nonequivalent contributors is determined by the extent to which they conform to the properties listed above. A larger number of significant contributing structures and a more voluminous space available for delocalized electrons lead to stabilization (lowering of the energy) of the molecule.

== Examples ==
===Aromatic molecules===

In benzene the two cyclohexatriene &quot;Kekulé&quot; structures, first proposed by Kekulé, are taken together as contributing structures to represent the total structure. In the hybrid structure on the right, the dashed hexagon replaces three double bonds, and represents six electrons in a set of three molecular orbitals of π symmetry, with a nodal plane in the plane of the molecule.

In furan a lone pair of the oxygen atom interacts with the π orbitals of the carbon atoms. The curved arrows depict the permutation of delocalized π electrons, which results in different contributors.

===Electron-rich molecules===
The ozone molecule is represented by two contributing structures. In reality the two terminal oxygen atoms are equivalent and the hybrid structure is drawn on the right with a charge of − on both oxygen atoms and partial double bonds with a full and dashed line and bond order .

For hypervalent molecules, the rationalization described above can be applied to generate contributing structures to explain the bonding in such molecules. Shown below are the contributing structures of a 3c-4e bond in xenon difluoride.
:&lt;chem&gt;[\mathsf{F-XeF^- &lt;-&gt; F^-Xe-F}]&lt;/chem&gt;

=== Electron-deficient molecules ===

The allyl cation has two contributing structures with a positive charge on the terminal carbon atoms. In the hybrid structure their charge is +. The full positive charge can also be depicted as delocalized among three carbon atoms.

The diborane molecule is described by contributing structures, each with electron-deficiency on different atoms. This reduces the electron-deficiency on each atom and stabilizes the molecule. Below are the contributing structures of an individual 3c-2e bond in diborane.

== Reactive intermediates ==
Often, reactive intermediates such as carbocations and free radicals have more delocalized structure than their parent reactants, giving rise to unexpected products. The classical example is allylic rearrangement. When 1 mole of HCl adds to 1 mole of 1,3-butadiene, in addition to the ordinarily expected product 3-chloro-1-butene, we also find 1-chloro-2-butene. Isotope labelling experiments have shown that what happens here is that the additional double bond shifts from 1,2 position to 2,3 position in some of the product. This and other evidence (such as NMR in superacid solutions) shows that the intermediate carbocation must have a highly delocalized structure, different from its mostly classical (delocalization exists but is small) parent molecule. This cation (an allylic cation) can be represented using resonance, as shown above.

This observation of greater delocalization in less stable molecules is quite general. The excited states of conjugated dienes are stabilised more by conjugation than their ground states, causing them to become organic dyes.

A well-studied example of delocalization that does not involve π electrons (hyperconjugation) can be observed in the non-classical 2-Norbornyl cation Another example is methanium (). These can be viewed as containing three-center two-electron bonds and are represented either by contributing structures involving rearrangement of σ electrons or by a special notation, a Y that has the three nuclei at its three points.

Delocalized electrons are important for several reasons; a major one is that an expected chemical reaction may not occur because the electrons delocalize to a more stable configuration, resulting in a reaction that happens at a different location. An example is the Friedel–Crafts alkylation of benzene with 1-chloro-2-methylpropane; the carbocation rearranges to a &quot;tert&quot;-butyl group stabilized by hyperconjugation, a particular form of delocalization.

== Benzene ==
===Bond lengths===
Comparing the two contributing structures of benzene, all single and double bonds are interchanged. Bond lengths can be measured, for example using X-ray diffraction. The average length of a C–C single bond is 154 pm; that of a C=C double bond is 133 pm. In localized cyclohexatriene, the carbon–carbon bonds should be alternating 154 and 133 pm. Instead, all carbon–carbon bonds in benzene are found to be about 139 pm, a bond length intermediate between single and double bond. This mixed single and double bond (or triple bond) character is typical for all molecules in which bonds have a different bond order in different contributing structures. Bond lengths can be compared using bond orders. For example, in cyclohexane the bond order is 1 while that in benzene is 1 + (3 ÷ 6) = . Consequently, benzene has more double bond character and hence has a shorter bond length than cyclohexane.
===Resonance energy===

Resonance (or delocalization) energy is the amount of energy needed to convert the true delocalized structure into that of the most stable contributing structure. The &quot;empirical resonance energy&quot; can be estimated by comparing the enthalpy change of hydrogenation of the real substance with that estimated for the contributing structure.

The complete hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane via 1,3-cyclohexadiene and cyclohexene is exothermic; 1 mole of benzene delivers 208.4 kJ (49.8 kcal).

Hydrogenation of one mole of double bonds delivers 119.7 kJ (28.6 kcal), as can be deduced from the last step, the hydrogenation of cyclohexene. In benzene, however, 23.4 kJ (5.6 kcal) are needed to hydrogenate one mole of double bonds. The difference, being 143.1 kJ (34.2 kcal), is the empirical resonance energy of benzene. Because 1,3-cyclohexadiene also has a small delocalization energy (7.6 kJ or 1.8 kcal/mol) the net resonance energy, relative to the localized cyclohexatriene, is a bit higher: 151 kJ or 36 kcal/mol.
This measured resonance energy is also the difference between the hydrogenation energy of three &#x27;non-resonance&#x27; double bonds and the measured hydrogenation energy:
:(3 × 119.7) − 208.4 = 150.7 kJ/mol (36 kcal).

Regardless of their exact values, resonance energies of various related compounds provide insights into their bonding. The resonance energies for pyrrole, thiophene, and furan are, respectively, 88, 121, and
67 kJ/mol (21, 29, and 16 kcal/mol). Thus, these heterocycles are far less aromatic than benzene, as is manifested in the lability of these rings.

== Quantum mechanical description in valence bond (VB) theory ==

Resonance has a deeper significance in the mathematical formalism of valence bond theory (VB). Quantum mechanics requires that the wavefunction of a molecule obey its observed symmetry. If a single contributing structure does not achieve this, resonance is invoked.

For example, in benzene, valence bond theory begins with the two Kekulé structures which do not individually possess the sixfold symmetry of the real molecule. The theory constructs the actual wave function as a linear superposition of the wave functions representing the two structures. As both Kekulé structures have equal energy, they are equal contributors to the overall structure – the superposition is an equally weighted average, or a 1:1 linear combination of the two in the case of benzene. The symmetric combination gives the ground state, while the antisymmetric combination gives the first excited state, as shown.

In general, the superposition is written with undetermined coefficients, which are then variationally optimized to find the lowest possible energy for the given set of basis wave functions. When more contributing structures are included, the molecular wave function becomes more accurate and more excited states can be derived from different combinations of the contributing structures.

=== Comparison with molecular orbital (MO) theory ===

In molecular orbital theory, the main alternative to valence bond theory, the molecular orbitals (MOs) are approximated as sums of all the atomic orbitals (AOs) on all the atoms; there are as many MOs as AOs. Each AO&quot;i&quot; has a &quot;weighting&quot; coefficient &quot;ci&quot; that indicates the AO&#x27;s contribution to a particular MO. For example, in benzene, the MO model gives us 6 π MOs which are combinations of the 2p&quot;z&quot; AOs on each of the 6 C atoms. Thus, each π MO is delocalized over the whole benzene molecule and any electron &quot;occupying&quot; an MO will be delocalized over the whole molecule. This MO interpretation has inspired the picture of the benzene ring as a hexagon with a circle inside. When describing benzene, the VB concept of localized σ bonds and the MO concept of delocalized π orbitals are frequently combined in elementary chemistry courses.

The contributing structures in the VB model are particularly useful in predicting the effect of substituents on π systems such as benzene. They lead to the models of contributing structures for an electron-withdrawing group and electron-releasing group on benzene. The utility of MO theory is that a quantitative indication of the charge from the π system on an atom can be obtained from the squares of the &quot;weighting&quot; coefficient &quot;ci&quot; on atom C&quot;i&quot;. Charge &quot;qi&quot; ≈ &quot;c&quot;. The reason for squaring the coefficient is that if an electron is described by an AO, then the square of the AO gives the electron density. The AOs are adjusted (normalized) so that AO2 = 1, and &quot;qi&quot; ≈ (&quot;ci&quot;AO&quot;i&quot;)2 ≈ &quot;c&quot;. In benzene, &quot;qi&quot; = 1 on each C atom. With an electron-withdrawing group &quot;qi&quot; &lt; 1 on the &quot;ortho&quot; and &quot;para&quot; C atoms and &quot;qi&quot; &gt; 1 for an electron-releasing group.

=== Coefficients ===

Weighting of the contributing structures in terms of their contribution to the overall structure can be calculated in multiple ways, using &quot;Ab initio&quot; methods derived from Valence Bond theory, or else from the Natural Bond Orbitals (NBO) approaches of Weinhold NBO5 , or finally from empirical calculations based on the Hückel method. A Hückel method-based software for teaching resonance is available on the HuLiS Web site.

== Charge delocalization ==
In the case of ions it is common to speak about delocalized charge (charge delocalization). An example of delocalized charge in ions can be found in the carboxylate group, wherein the negative charge is centered equally on the two oxygen atoms. Charge delocalization in anions is an important factor determining their reactivity (generally: the higher the extent of delocalization the lower the reactivity) and, specifically, the acid strength of their conjugate acids. As a general rule, the better delocalized is the charge in an anion the stronger is its conjugate acid. For example, the negative charge in perchlorate anion () is evenly distributed among the symmetrically oriented oxygen atoms (and a part of it is also kept by the central chlorine atom). This excellent charge delocalization combined with the high number of oxygen atoms (four) and high electronegativity of the central chlorine atom leads to perchloric acid being one of the strongest known acids with a p&quot;K&quot;a value of −10.
The extent of charge delocalization in an anion can be quantitatively expressed via the WAPS (weighted average positive sigma) parameter parameter and an analogous WANS (weighted average negative sigma) parameter is used for cations.

WAPS and WANS values are given in e/Å4. Larger values indicate more localized charge in the corresponding ion.
