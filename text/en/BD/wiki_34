==History==

===1853 description===

OMRO, P. V., on section 17 and 18, in town of Bloomingdale, Winnebago county, at the junction of the Manitowoc and Menasha, (extended), and the Waupun and Liberty Prairie plank roads. It is pleasantly situated on the south side of the Neenah [Fox] river, 11 miles west from Oshkosh, and 75 miles northeast from Madison. It has a heavy body of timber on the north, with a rich soil of openings and prairie on the south, and has excellent facilities by water for obtaining pine logs from the immense pinery of Wolf river, a great quantity of which is here manufactured into lumber. Population 600, with 100 dwellings, 5 stores, 2 hotels, 3 mills, and 4 religious denominations. A Company has been organized and is now completing the proper buildings for the manufacture of glass.
===History of Omro===
The area encompassing present day Omro was Winnebago Indian Territory when it was first visited by French explorers in 1639. Omro&#x27;s location gave it two advantages from the beginning, which were a position on one of the few natural transportation and communications routes of the time and an abundant amount of water for industrial use. The first modern settlers visited in 1847. There are at least three differing accounts of how the town was named. One widely held version is that it was named for Charles Amereau, a French trader and blacksmith who started a fur trading post there.

By 1880, Omro was a stop on the railroad line and was home to the county fairgrounds, several mills, a glass factory, carriage factories, several machine works, and had a population greater than 2,000. Eventually most of the manufacturers either relocated to nearby Oshkosh, or faded away. Since Omro began a revitalization process in 1986, it has seen growth. Several projects pay respects to Omro&#x27;s past, including a historical walking tour, the Scott park pavilion project, and the designation of a historic downtown district.

<text>Oshkosh () is a city in and the county seat of Winnebago County, Wisconsin, United States, located on the western shore of Lake Winnebago. It had a population of 66,816 as of the 2020 census, making it the ninth-most populous city in Wisconsin. It is also adjacent to the much less populous Town of Oshkosh in the north. The Oshkosh metropolitan statistical area, which consists of all of Winnebago County, had 171,730 residents in 2020 and is included in the greater Fox Cities region of Wisconsin.

==History==
Oshkosh was named for Menominee Chief Oshkosh, whose name meant &quot;claw&quot; (cf. Ojibwe &quot;oshkanzh&quot;, &quot;the claw&quot;).

Although the fur trade attracted the first European settlers to the area as early as 1818, it never became a major player in the fur trade. The 1820s mining boom in southwest Wisconsin along with the opening of the Erie Canal shifted commercial activity away from the Fox River Valley and Green Bay. Soon after 1830, much of the trade moved west, as there had been over-trapping in the region.

Following the publicity caused by the Black Hawk War in 1832, there was increased interest in settling Wisconsin by whites from the East Coast, especially New York, Indiana, and Virginia, and by 1836 the cities of Milwaukee, Madison, Janesville, Beloit, and Fond du Lac were founded, with Madison the capital of a new territorial government, setting the stage for the economic and political importance of the southern part of the state. However, Oshkosh would continue to be one of Wisconsin&#x27;s top five largest cities into the twentieth century.

The establishment and growth of the wood industry in the area spurred development of Oshkosh. Already designated as the county seat, Oshkosh was incorporated as a city in 1853. It had a population of nearly 2,800.

The lumber industry became well established as businessmen took advantage of navigable waterways to provide access to both markets and northern pineries. The 1859 arrival of rail transportation expanded the industry&#x27;s ability to meet the demands of a rapidly growing construction market. At one time, Oshkosh was known as the &quot;Sawdust Capital of the World&quot; due to the number of lumber mills in the city, 11 by 1860.

During the Civil War, the 21st Regiment, Wisconsin Infantry, of the Union Wisconsin Volunteers was organized at Oshkosh, taking in many new recruits. This was one of two units organized in the state; the other was the 6th Regiment, Wisconsin Infantry, organized at Camp Randall, Madison. The 21st mustered on September 5, 1862, marching to Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky, where it participated in the fortification of Louisville later that year. It was attached to the Army of the Ohio and later to the Army of the Cumberland.

By 1870, Oshkosh had become the third-largest city in Wisconsin, with a population of more than 12,000. The community attracted a range of professional teachers, attorneys, doctors, businessmen, and others who helped it flourish. The &quot;Oshkosh Daily Northwestern&quot; newspaper (now the &quot;Oshkosh Northwestern&quot;) was founded around this time, as was the Oshkosh State Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh). Lumber continued as the mainstay of the city. By 1874, it had 47 sawmills and 15 shingle mills.

On April 28, 1875, Oshkosh had a &quot;Great Fire&quot; that consumed homes and businesses along Main Street north of the Fox River. The fire engulfed 70 stores, 40 factories, and 500 homes, costing nearly $2.5 million (or $67.3 million in 2022 money) in damage.

Around 1900 Oshkosh was home of the Oshkosh Brewing Company, which coined the marketing slogan &quot;By Gosh It&#x27;s Good.&quot; Its Chief Oshkosh brand became a nationally distributed beer.

The population of the city in 1910 was 33,062, making it the state&#x27;s fourth largest city, ahead of Madison and Green Bay.

The Oshkosh All-Stars played in the National Basketball League from 1937 to 1949, before the NBL and the Basketball Association of America merged to become the NBA. Oshkosh reached the NBL&#x27;s championship finals five times.

===Historic districts===
The city has a total of 33 listings on the National Register of Historic Places. Some area entrepreneurs and businessmen made their fortunes in the lumber industry. Many made significant contributions to the community, in both politics and supporting philanthropic organizations. Following devastating fires in the mid-1870s, new buildings were commissioned in Oshkosh that expressed a range of good design: for residential, commercial, civic and religious use.

The many structures which make up the city&#x27;s historic areas are largely a result of the capital and materials generated by the lumber and associated wood manufacturing industries. Oshkosh had six historic districts as of October 2011. They include the Algoma Boulevard, Irving/Church, North Main Street, Oshkosh State Normal School on the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh campus, Paine Lumber Company, and Washington Avenue historic districts.

The city had 27 historic buildings and sites individually listed on the NRHP as of October 2011. Eleven are houses, four are churches, and the remainder include schools, colleges, a bank, a fire house, an observatory, the Winnebago County Courthouse, and a cemetery where many of the entrepreneurs are buried.

==Economy==

Oshkosh Corporation is headquartered in Oshkosh. Oshkosh Corporation, formerly Oshkosh Truck, is a manufacturer and marketer of specialty vehicles and bodies in four primary business groups: Access Equipment, Defense, Fire &amp; Emergency, and Commercial. Plastic packaging is also a major industry, with Amcor, formerly Bemis, as a major employer. There are two well known chocolate companies located in Oshkosh, Hughes and Oaks.

Oshkosh is known for OshKosh B&#x27;gosh, a manufacturer of overalls and children&#x27;s clothing founded in the city in 1895. Originally a small-town manufacturer of adult work clothing, it became best known for its children&#x27;s lines. The original children&#x27;s overalls, dating from the early twentieth century, were intended to help children dress like their fathers. According to the company, sales increased dramatically when Miles Kimball, an Oshkosh-based mail-order catalog, featured a pair of the overalls in its national catalog. As a result, OshKosh B&#x27;Gosh began to sell their products through department stores and expanded their children&#x27;s line. Their office is now based in Atlanta, Georgia.

Oshkosh is the home of EAA AirVenture Oshkosh, &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Aviation Celebration&quot; held by the Experimental Aircraft Association, Inc. (&quot;EAA&quot;). AirVenture is the world&#x27;s largest airshow. During AirVenture, air traffic at Wittman Regional Airport exceeds that of any other airport in the world. EAA is a non-profit member organization, dedicated to home-built aircraft, restored aircraft, and Light-sport aircraft, and fostering an interest in flying in children 8–18 years old through its Young Eagles program.

Tourism and events are part of the local economy. Recreational fishing and boating on Lake Winnebago includes many active fishing tournaments, an annual sturgeon spearing season, and frequent yacht and boat races. Music festivals include the summer-long WaterFest downtown and major summer music festivals for country, Christian, and rock music. December features a drive-through lights show that brings in visitors from the surrounding area.

Oshkosh is also home to two regional hospitals and the Winnebago Mental Health Institute located in nearby Winnebago, Wisconsin.

==Arts and culture==

A downtown redevelopment plan led to the construction of the outdoor Leach Amphitheater on the Fox River. It hosts the weekly Waterfest concert series during the summer, as well as national touring musical acts and local community events. Also in downtown Oshkosh is the Grand Opera House, a performing arts center. Downtown Oshkosh has a farmers Market on Saturdays in the summer.

The Downtown Oshkosh Gallery Walk, held every first Saturday of the month year-round, surged in attendance through the warmer months of 2006. A number of downtown Oshkosh music venues have opened, and existing venues have tended to expand their schedules, following the trend of the area at large. The Jambalaya Art Cooperative and Art Space Collective have been long standing anchors of the Gallery Walk. In 2010, &quot;Chicago Magazine&quot; said The Jambalaya Cooperative, 413 N. Main St., was a &quot;must see&quot; destination when visiting Oshkosh.

Long-running community festivals, such as Sawdust Days in Menominee Park, was a popular event but discontinued in 2019. Menominee Park is also the site of the Menominee Park Zoo.

Pub Crawl is an unsanctioned, unofficial event that happens twice a year, once in the fall and once in the spring on the second weekend of April and October. Supposedly, according to the organizers, it was the largest and longest running college pub crawl. It is not officially sanctioned by the city, but it used to attract students across the state to the university area. Many area bars and restaurants reported an uptick in sales, though with the raised revenue also came higher incident rates for local police. The local university put in measures to keep students safe and control how people move throughout the campus.

From 1999 to 2019, the Seventh-day Adventist-hosted International Pathfinder Camporee was held in Oshkosh, gathering tens of thousands youth and adults from all over the world every 5 years. The most recent Camporee in 2019 gathered over 56,000 Pathfinders, and is considered the largest Adventist youth event in history, with over 1,000 people being baptized. One of the main highlights of the camporees were the evening programs, specifically the plays which reenacted the stories of famous characters and stories from the Bible onstage. They were held in campgrounds close to the EAA Aviation Museum, with some of the hangars being renovated to make room for booths where Pathfinders would get multiple honors. In 2021, it was announced that the International Pathfinder Camporee would be hosted in Gillette, Wyoming, in 2024.

==Government==
Oshkosh had a mayor-alderman form of government from its charter in 1853. It abolished the position of mayor and implemented the council-manager form of government in 1957. The city-wide elected office of &quot;mayor&quot; was subsequently restored in 2005, but is more akin to president of the city council. Executive power in the city still resides with the city manager.

The current city manager is Rebecca Grill, who was selected by the city council in 2024. The mayor is Matt Mugerauer, elected in 2023.

For representation in the state legislature, Oshkosh has been primarily represented by the 54th Assembly district since the 1983 redistricting law. Since 1992, the 53rd district has also represented parts of the city of Oshkosh, but the bulk of that district is rural and suburban areas of Winnebago and counties. After the 2024 redistricting, the 54th district will still contain most of Oshkosh, but the southern third of the city will be part of the 55th district, which also comprises most of the rest of the territory of Winnebago County.

In the State Senate, Oshkosh is part of the 18th Senate district, represented by Dan Feyen (R). After the 2024 redistricting, most of Oshkosh will still be in the 18th Senate district, but the southern third of the city will be in the 19th Senate district, represented by Rachael Cabral-Guevara (R).

Federally, Oshkosh falls within Wisconsin&#x27;s 6th congressional district, which is represented by Glenn Grothman (R) since 2015. Wisconsin&#x27;s United States senators are Ron Johnson (R) and Tammy Baldwin (D).

The Oshkosh Correctional Institution, a Wisconsin Department of Corrections prison, is located in Oshkosh.

==Education==
Oshkosh has 14 public elementary schools, five public middle schools, and two high schools operated by the Oshkosh Area School District. The high schools in the Oshkosh Area School District are Oshkosh North High School and Oshkosh West High School.

Lourdes High School is one of the private schools in the city.

The University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh, the third-largest university in the state, is located in Oshkosh. The downtown campus serves approximately 15,000 students and employs 1,700 staff. Higher education is also served by a campus of the Fox Valley Technical College.

==Transportation==

===Major highways===


=== Bus ===
Oshkosh is also served by the GO Transit (formerly Oshkosh Transit System), which runs nine fixed-route bus routes throughout the city from 6:15 am until 6:45 pm Monday through Saturday. One of these routes also connects Oshkosh with Neenah, Wisconsin, and the Fox Cities&#x27; transit system, Valley Transit. Intercity buses to Green Bay, Madison and other destinations are provided by Amtrak Thruway, Lamers Bus Lines, and Van Galder Bus Company.

===Airport===
Oshkosh&#x27;s airport, Wittman Field or Wittman Regional Airport (KOSH), opened in 1927 as Oshkosh Airport Inc. The airport had commercial traffic starting in 1928 when Northwest Airways delivered mail to Oshkosh and the Fox Cities. In 1972, the airport was renamed after race pilot Steve Wittman, who was the airport manager for 38 years.

Wittman Field had commercial service on a number of airlines until 2003. Wittman was served at various times by Wisconsin Central Airlines, North Central, Republic, Air Wisconsin, American Central, Midstate Airlines, Northwest Airlink, United Express, Midway Connection, Skyway, and Great Lakes. Service on the final carrier, Great Lakes, was terminated in 2003 following the FAA&#x27;s termination of a federal subsidy.

In the 21st century, Wittman Field continues to host the EAA AirVenture Air Show and Expo (formerly the EAA Annual Convention and Fly-In up to 1998). The EAA was founded in 1953 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, by Paul Poberezny. The event was first held at Timmerman Field. In 1959, it was moved to Rockford, Illinois. By 1969, the EAA had grown too big for Rockford Municipal Airport, and the convention voted on moving to Oshkosh. During the Airshow, Wittman Regional Airport becomes the busiest airport in the world: more than 500,000 people and 10,000 airplanes attend AirVenture each year.

The closest airport with commercial service is Appleton International Airport in Appleton, Wisconsin

<text>Winneconne is a town in Winnebago County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 2,350 at the 2010 census. The Village of Winneconne is located within the town, on both sides of the Wolf River. The unincorporated community of Butte des Morts, named for a French and Native American trading war, is also located in the town. The town&#x27;s water resources of rivers and lakes makes it a center of hunting and fishing, including winter ice fishing.

==History==
The name is a word derived from the Menominee language meaning &quot;place of skulls&quot;. It refers to a battle site of the French colonial era, in which the Sauk and Fox fought against the French, Menominee and Chippewa for control over the regional fur trade and other resources. It also refers to a nearby prehistoric indigenous burial mound, the namesake for Lake Butte des Morts.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 36.02%, is water. This is the area of the Wolf Chain, a series of connected lakes along the river.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 2,145 people, 838 households, and 666 families residing in the town. The population density was 97.6 people per square mile (37.7/km2). There were 1,020 housing units at an average density of 46.4 per square mile (17.9/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 99.44% White, 0.23% Native American, 0.19% Asian, and 0.14% from two or more races. 0.19% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 838 households, out of which 30.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 71.5% were married couples living together, 4.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 20.5% were non-families. 16.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.56 and the average family size was 2.87.

== 20th-century Secession ==
In 1967, the town name was inadvertently left off the official Wisconsin road map. When residents noticed, they formed a secret committee and formulated a plan to secede from Wisconsin, set up toll gates on local roads and begin annexation of nearby communities (starting with the city of Oshkosh) to form a &quot;Sovereign State of Winneconne&quot;.

As an alternative plan, they intended to seek annexation by another state, preferably one with better weather. The deadline for secession was July 21, 1967. A proclamation was issued, naming village president, &quot;James Coughlin to be president of the new state of Winneconne; Vera Kitchen to be prime minister and custodian of Vera&#x27;s Kitchen Cabinet.&quot; Wisconsin Governor Warren Knowles entered into negotiations with the former village officials; as a result, Winneconne rejoined the State of Wisconsin at 12:01 AM on July 22, 1967. An annual Sovereign State Days celebration commemorates the event.

<text>Winneconne is a village in Winnebago County, Wisconsin. The population was 2,383 at the time of the 2010 census. The village is located within the Town of Winneconne. Developed along the Wolf River, the community is in the middle of the Wolf Chain of lakes, including Poygan, Winneconne, and Butte des Morts. It is host to numerous bass fishing tournaments.

==History==
This area was originally occupied by succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples. The historic Menominee people were settled in the area at the time of European encounter. French fur traders from Quebec were among the first to interact with them, followed by Catholic Jesuit missionaries. The area was ruled by Great Britain as part of the Province of Quebec and then acquired by the United States.

Winneconne&#x27;s European-American settlement began in the mid-19th century with Yankees who migrated from New England and the Northern Tier, added to by waves of immigrants: Irish, Germans, and Norwegians. Originally, Winneconne had many different spellings: Winneconnah, Winnekonah, Wau-nau-ko, and Winnikning, which were transliterations from the Menominee and other Indian names for the site. The Indian meanings of these names ranged from &quot;land of dirty water&quot; to &quot;land of skull and bones&quot;, referring to a prehistoric burial mound known as &quot;Butte des Morts&quot; by the French. In 1851 the recently constituted village board officially settled the spelling of the name as Winneconne.

Joseph Edwards (1809–1902) was the first postmaster. He was a migrant from Hopewell, Bedford County, Pennsylvania via 15 years farming in Richland County, Ohio. He first settled with his family in Winneconne in 1849, building the first frame house in the village. After living here a few years, he moved to Dayton, Waupaca County, Wisconsin for more farming. He and his wife Mary (Wright) Edwards returned to this village in 1886. She died in 1895; and four of their nine children survived him: Mrs. D.C. Reed was still living in the village; son Oscar A. Edwards lived in Rhinelander, and two married daughters lived in Tacoma, Washington.

After the Treaty of Poygan in 1852, by which the Menominee ceded more land in this area to the United States, Winneconne expanded its land west of the Wolf River. Chief Oshkosh negotiated with the President to keep other lands in this area, as more than 2500 of his people refused to move to Minnesota, as was desired by the federal government. The Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin is federally recognized.

Because of the expansion of the village, people needed to cross the river more frequently. Initially the Menominee would transport people and goods by canoe. In 1853, settler J.D. Rush built a float bridge, and set up toll stations to recover his costs. Since then a total of four bridges have been built, including the current one.

In Winneconne&#x27;s early years, mills were built along the river as the first industries, to process lumber, grain, and operate tanneries. Commercial fishing was also a thriving business. The many shipyards built and repaired fleets then made up primarily of wooden boats and ships.

With its many rivers and lakes, Winneconne has been known as a &quot;hunting and fishing paradise.&quot; Some resort housing has been built in the area.

Improvements continue in the area. The Wolf River Bridge, carrying WIS 116, was built in 1934 during the Great Depression with support from the federal government, under President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s WPA projects for investment in infrastructure. This non-redundant bascule bridge is now functionally obsolete because of its narrow deck width and aging materials. As it is very important to the Main Street of the village, and connections to other cities in the region, the state has approved a new bridge to carry WIS 116. A new bridge will also have fishing platforms, as does the current one.

===Secession===
In 1967, as a result of the town name being inadvertently left off the official Wisconsin road map, a secret committee led by Vera Wentzel-Kitchen of the Arrowhead Restaurant formulated a plan to secede from Wisconsin, set up toll gates on local roads, and begin annexation of nearby communities, starting with the city of Oshkosh, to form a &quot;Sovereign State of Winneconne&quot;. As an alternative plan, they sought annexation by another state, preferably one with better weather. The deadline for secession was July 21, 1967. A proclamation was issued, naming village president &quot;James Coughlin to be president of the new state of Winneconne; Vera Kitchen to be prime minister and custodian of Vera’s Kitchen Cabinet&quot;. The secession was not recognized by any formal government and was merely a gesture indicative of the village&#x27;s displeasure with state officials. Wisconsin Governor Warren P. Knowles met with village officials; as a result, Winneconne reconciled with the state of Wisconsin on July 22, 1967. An annual Sovereign State Days celebration commemorates the event, and a logo showing poison ivy, a skunk, a sheepshead, and a dodo bird is displayed throughout the town.

==Geography==
Winneconne is located at 44°6&#x27;39&quot; North, 88°42&#x27;51&quot; West (44.111029, -88.714311).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which, of it is land and is water.

The city was built along the banks of the Wolf Chain, which includes Lake Poygan, Lake Winneconne, and Lake Butte des Morts. Many bass fishing tournaments are based in Winneconne due to its central location on the chain.

<text>Arpin is a village in Wood County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 305 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all of it land.

North Wood County Park is located nearby.

==History==

The first village of Arpin was started around 1890 when the John Arpin Lumber Company built a sawmill a mile east of the present village, on Little Hemlock Creek. John Baptiste Arpin and his twin brother Antoine came from Quebec and had been logging in this part of Wisconsin since the 1860s. By 1890 they were working with John&#x27;s sons. To give an idea of their scale of operations, John Arpin&#x27;s house built in 1890 still stands in Wisconsin Rapids - the beautiful Queen Anne-styled house on First Street facing the river. Back in that first Arpin, a store, a post office, some homes, a Presbyterian church, and a creamery grew up near the sawmill. The first postmaster was John&#x27;s son, J. Z.

Also in 1890, the Port Edwards, Centralia &amp; Northern Railway (later acquired by the Wisconsin Central) built its line from Rapids to Marshfield a mile to the west of the first village. Martin Pfyle started another little village a mile south on the rail line. It had a store, a cheese factory, a saloon, and homes. However, the railroad had built its depot where it crossed the road that is now County N - not at the sawmill or the second village - but where the current village is. Near that depot a store started, and a saloon, and a blacksmith&#x27;s shop. Gradually the businesses and most of the homes shifted from the other two villages to cluster around the depot.

Around 1891 the Wood County Railroad built a spur to the mill from Vesper and in 1892 the John Edwards Manufacturing Company built a logging spur NE out of Arpin, three miles into its timber holdings. The Arpin planing mill burned in 1893 and the sawmill in June 1894, but the Arpins still had lumber to cut, so they rebuilt. In 1902 the Chicago &amp; Northwestern built another rail line alongside the first, also running from Rapids to Marshfield.

Arpin in these days was an interesting cultural mix. Through all this time, a community of Potawatomi and other Indians lived at Skunk Hill, four miles to the southwest, welcoming outsiders to some of their dances. And then there was the Jewish settlement.

Arpin was the site of an early twentieth century agricultural settlement of Jewish families from Europe. The German philanthropist Baron Maurice de Hirsch had become concerned about the plight of European Jews who were migrating in increasing numbers to large cities. He established the Industrial Removal Office to settle Jewish families into what were seen as more healthy environments. The Milwaukee branch of the office was the Milwaukee Jewish Industrial Aid Society, headed by Adolph Walter Rich, Milwaukee merchant, manufacturer, and philanthropist. As the trees near Arpin were cut and the sawmill ceased operations, both houses and land were available. The society purchased of land just north of town, and Rich eventually added additional acres. Each family was to be assigned a tract with livestock, implements, a suitable dwelling, and funds to cover incidental expenses. A foreman was to be appointed to supervise the settlement. It was to be &quot;a true Zion&quot; in Wisconsin &quot;on a moderate scale.&quot;

On December 1, 1901 the first five families arrived. More followed. Many of the new settlers were from Russia. By May 1906 the new settlers had cleared an average of each and had begun to produce crops of corn and vegetables and to cut cord wood. With the money from these crops the settlers were able to begin payment of interest owed to the society. Rich made frequent trips to Arpin. In 1915 a Jewish house of worship was built. A strong feeling of community developed among the settlers and they got along well with their Christian neighbors. The number of people in the settlement was never large, about seventy or eighty people at most, almost of all of whom were engaged in agriculture. In the 1920s people began to drift away; bitterly cold winters, better paying jobs in nearby cities, and the difficulties of anyone in Wisconsin trying to making a living on small farms were all factors in the slow decline of the colony. In 2008 Wisconsin Public Television produced a program, &quot;Chosen Towns&quot;, which features interviews with people remembering Arpin and other similar settlements.

By the 1920s dairying had surpassed lumbering. Four cheese factories were operating near the village. The Dairyman&#x27;s State Bank had started in 1914. The town had also added various churches, a hardware store, a meat market, a boot and shoe store, a lumber yard, a garage, a restaurant, and a hotel and livery and taxicab stable.

<text>Arpin is a town in Wood County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 942 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1851 the square which later became the town of Arpin was surveyed by crews working for the U.S. government. They found the section corners with chain and compass and marked them. When done, the deputy surveyors filed these general descriptions:
&quot;The soil in this Township is generally a dark loam and is very (?), the surface is generally level, except in the South western part which is Rolling and somewhat stony - the stone are a Blue Flint - The Timber in the South West Part is mostly Sugar (?) Ironwood &amp; Butternut with very little or no undergrowth. The Eastern and Northern Part is heavily timbered also the Timber being mostly Birch Oak Pine Soft Maple with some undergrowth of Blue Beech along the Border of the streams. We usually find alder thickets caused by the overflowing of the Bottom Lands in times of high water &amp; from Beaver Dams. The streams are mostly fed by the swamps and are subject to (?) sudden rise and fall.&quot;

&quot;This may be considered a valuable district of which a considerable portion would command a ready rate, if in market at the present time. There is no settlement upon it. A few small rough log cabins, occupied in the winter season by the shingle makers, comprise all the improvements on it.&quot;

The six mile square that would become Auburndale was first surveyed in the summer of 1851 by a crew working for the U.S. government. In November and December 1852 another crew marked its section corners, walking through the woods and wading the streams, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;This Township contains no Marshes. It is generally heavily timbered chiefly with Hemlock, Sugar Yellow Birch, and Rock Elm. White Pine abounds on Mill Creek and some of the head Branches of the Little O&#x27;Plane. The surface is generally level about half is hardwood land where the soil is first and second rate. Mill Creek runs across the southwest corner of the Township and the north branch of the Little O&#x27;Plane rises in this township and runs out on the north side. They are both rapid streams but all the banks are too low for Mill purposes. Local attraction exists nearly all over the Township, but is strongest near the center. There are no improvements in the Township.&quot;

<text>Port Edwards is a town in Wood County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,446 at the 2000 census. The village of Port Edwards is located to the northeast of and adjacent to the town. The town contains the Ho-Chunk community of Ceex Haci.
==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 39.2 square miles (101.6 km2), of which, 38.6 square miles (100.0 km2) of it is land and 0.6 square miles (1.6 km2) of it (1.58%) is water.

==History==
The part of the town of Port Edwards within three miles of the Wisconsin River was in the &quot;Indian strip,&quot; sold by the Menominee to the U.S. government in the 1836 Treaty of the Cedars. As such, it was logged and surveyed early. In 1839 a crew working for the U.S. government surveyed what would become parts of Port Edwards, walking through the woods and crossing the river, measuring with chain and compass. In 1851 a different crew surveyed the section lines. For the six mile square that now contains Nekoosa and the village of Port Edwards, they gave this general description:
&quot;The character of the Soil in this town is very uniform. The Uplands are all pine barrens on a light Sandy Soil. the timber nearly all burned off by the yearly Indian fires. The large pines, valuable for lumber, are all gone. The bottom lands tho somewhat better, are sandy &amp; not sufficiently large to make them valuable. Inhabitants are very scarce thin(?) being a Single house at Pt. Bausse, a noted(?) place for refitting rafts after passing the rapids before their final departure for the Mississippi, &amp; a French hamlet on Section 1. On the whole it may be said of this town that for soil or timber it is nearly worthless. The Islands in the river are all overflowed &amp; are neither valuable for size, soil, or timber &amp; were therefore not meandered.&quot;

Port Edwards was established in 1874, taking its name from the village of the same name within its borders.

<text>Port Edwards is a village in Wood County, Wisconsin, United States. The village is located northeast and adjacent to the Town of Port Edwards. The population was 1,818 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
Port Edwards was known as &quot;Frenchtown&quot; until 1869, when it was renamed in honor of John Edwards, a local mill owner.

The settlement formed around a sawmill built about 1829. It was first owned by Messrs. Grignon and Merrill, who partnered in the mill for some time. It then passed on to Merrill and Whitney in 1836. In 1840 the mill was bought by John Edwards Sr. and his partner, Henry Clinton. It was then that the sawmill business, known as the Edwards and Clinton Company, began to prosper. The partnership didn&#x27;t last. Because of Clinton&#x27;s financial troubles, he had to transfer portions of his equity to Edwards throughout the years. By 1862 Edwards owned 100 percent of the business and changed the name to John Edwards and Company. A few years later, active management was given over to his son, John Jr. The senior Edwards died In 1871.

Mrs. Edwards wrote of the community in the 1860s, &quot;the settlement was small only consisting of a store, a blacksmith shop, a school, two boarding houses and a number of white houses.&quot; With his success in the sawmill business, Edwards decided to run for the Wisconsin legislature as a Representative in 1890. After his election, he moved to Madison in 1891, leaving his business to be managed by his son-in-law, Lewis M. Alexander.

By the end of the 19th century most sawmills in central Wisconsin had gone out of business. Alexander decided to take a risk and convert the sawmill company into a paper mill company, completing the conversion in 1896. Although the change proved economically challenging, the company eventually succeeded, although it experienced ups and downs reflecting the overall economy.

Port Edwards incorporated as a village in 1902.

With the town heavily dependent on the mill, it slowly grew to become the community it is today. Today the village consists of a small cluster of 1890s to 1940s homes that have been preserved and refurbished. The mill shut down in 2008. The village named the high school in honor of John Edwards. The house belonging to Lewis M. Alexander&#x27;s son, John, still stands.

The part of the town within three miles of the Wisconsin River was in the &quot;Indian strip,&quot; sold by the Menominees to the U.S. government in the 1836 Treaty of the Cedars. As such, it was logged and surveyed early. In 1840 a crew working for the U.S. government surveyed that southern half of the six mile square that would become the town of Rudolph, walking through the woods and crossing the river, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;Considerable good land on the North East part of this Fractional Township. Extensive(?) Lumbering Establishment of Draper Faytte(?) on sec 34. Apparently Extensive Bog iron ore bed on same section a short distance above said milling Establishment - specimen appears very rich &amp; heavy.&quot;
The mill and bog iron were actually on the south side of the river, in what would become Biron.

In 1851 another crew surveyed the section lines of the north half of what would become the town of Rudolph, producing this general description:
&quot;Maple &amp; Oak are the prevailing Kinds of Timber in this Township although there is some Pine The creeks &amp; streams of water are mostly fed by swamps and are not durable. the soil is a dark loam with clay sub-soil; there is a great deal of stone in this Township. which decreases its value for farming purposes, the Surface is generally Rolling. though it is not hilly&quot;

<text>This is a list of articles and categories dealing with beer and breweries by region: the breweries and beers in various regions. Beer is the world&#x27;s most widely consumed alcoholic drink, and is the third-most popular drink overall, after water and tea. It is thought by some to be the oldest fermented drink. A brewery is a dedicated building for the making of beer, though beer can be made at home, and has been for much of beer&#x27;s history. A company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a brewing company. The diversity of size in breweries is matched by the diversity of processes, degrees of automation, and kinds of beer produced in breweries. A brewery is typically divided into distinct sections, with each section reserved for one part of the brewing process.

===Armenia===

Beer has been brewed by Armenians since ancient times. One of the first confirmed written evidences of ancient beer production is Xenophon&#x27;s reference to &quot;wine made from barley&quot; in one of the ancient Armenia villages, as described in his 5th century B.C. work Anabasis: &quot;There were stores within of wheat and barley and vegetables, and wine made from barley in great big bowls; the grains of barley malt lay floating in the drink up to the lip of the vessel, and reeds lay in them, some longer, some shorter, without joints; when you were thirsty you must take one of these into your mouth, and suck. The drink without admixture of water was very strong, and of a delicious flavour to certain palates, but the taste must be acquired.&quot;

Currently there are six local brewing companies throughout the country producing a variety of beer types:
* Beer of Yerevan Brewery in Yerevan: around 15 types of beer are served by the brewery, mainly under the brand Kilikia (named after a historic Armenian kingdom at the Mediterranean coast) as well as some other brands.
* Gyumri Beer Brewery in Gyumri: the company produces a variety of lager beer under 3 brands: Gyumri, Aleksandrapol and Ararat.
* Kotayk Brewery in Abovyan: a variety of lager beer under the brand Kotayk (named after the Armenian Kotayk Province), as well as Erebuni and Urartu.
* Lihnitis Sevan Brewery in Sevan: the company produces the Kellers beer.
* Hayasy Group in Voskevaz village, Aragatsotn Province: currently producing under the brand Hayasy.
* Dilijan Brewery in Dilijan: producing under the brand Dilijan.

In addition to brewing factories, the country is also home to 8 microbreweries/brewpubs, that produce and serve draught/unfiltered beer in Armenia.

===Myanmar===

The dominant brewery in Myanmar, with an approximately 80% share of the market, is Myanmar Brewery, which is 45% owned by Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited. Myanmar Brewery&#x27;s beers include Myanmar Beer, Double Strong Beer, Andaman Gold (Red) and Andaman Gold (Blue). In 2015 Myanmar Brewery entered into a joint venture with Kirin Brewery to produce and distribute its beers in the country. In 2013 the Carlsberg Group signed an agreement with Myanmar Golden Star, establishing Myanmar Carlsberg Company Ltd. Myanmar Carlsberg Company opened a $75 million brewery in May 2015 which now produces Carlsberg and Turborg locally, together with a new beer, Yoma. In July 2015 Heineken International opened a $60 million brewery in Yangon, in a joint venture with a local company, Alliance Brewery Company. The brewery produces Tiger, Heineken, ABC stout and a new rice beer, Regal Seven.

===North Korea===

North Korea has at least ten major breweries and many microbreweries that supply a wide range of beer products. The top brand is the light lager Taedonggang which is internationally known for its quality.

The country&#x27;s problems with goods distribution and power output has forced North Korean brewers to innovate. To minimize distribution, many restaurants and hotels maintain their own microbreweries. Because unreliable power supply makes it difficult to refrigerate beer, North Koreans have developed their own steam beer, an originally American beer style brewed in higher than normal temperatures, that is widely available.

Although the Korean liquor soju is preferred, beer comes second when it comes to consumption. Since the 1980s, beer has been within reach of ordinary North Koreans, though it is still rationed. Tourists, on the other hand, enjoy inexpensive beer without such limitations.

<text>The Canadian National Railway Company () is a Canadian Class I freight railway headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, which serves Canada and the Midwestern and Southern United States.

CN is Canada&#x27;s largest railway, in terms of both revenue and the physical size of its rail network, spanning Canada from the Atlantic coast in Nova Scotia to the Pacific coast in British Columbia across approximately of track. In the late 20th century, CN gained extensive capacity in the United States by taking over such railroads as the Illinois Central.

CN is a public company with 24,671 employees and, , a market cap of approximately US$75 billion. CN was government-owned, as a Canadian Crown corporation, from its founding in 1919 until being privatized in 1995. , Bill Gates was the largest single shareholder of CN stock, owning a 14.2% interest through Cascade Investment and his own Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

From 1919 to 1978, the railway was known as &quot;Canadian National Railways&quot; (CNR).

==History==
The Canadian National Railways (CNR) was incorporated on June 6, 1919, comprising several railways that had become bankrupt and fallen into Government of Canada hands, along with some railways already owned by the government. Primarily a freight railway, CN also operated passenger services until 1978, when they were assumed by Via Rail. The only passenger services run by CN after 1978 were several mixed trains (freight and passenger) in Newfoundland, and several commuter trains both on CN&#x27;s electrified routes and towards the South Shore in the Montreal area (the latter lasted without any public subsidy until 1986). The Newfoundland mixed trains lasted until 1988, while the Montreal commuter trains are now operated by Montreal&#x27;s EXO.

On November 17, 1995, the Government of Canada privatized CN. Over the next decade, the company expanded significantly into the United States, purchasing Illinois Central Railroad and Wisconsin Central Transportation, among others.

===Creation of the company, 1918–1923===
The excessive construction of railway lines in Canada led to significant financial difficulties striking many of them, in the years leading up to 1920:

:* In response to public concerns, the Government of Canada assumed majority ownership of the near-bankrupt Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) on September 6, 1918, and appointed a &quot;Board of Management&quot; to oversee the company. At the same time, CNoR was also directed to assume management of Canadian Government Railways (CGR), a system mainly comprising the Intercolonial Railway of Canada (IRC), National Transcontinental Railway (NTR), Prince Edward Island Railway (PEIR), and the Hudson Bay Railway (HBR).
:* On December 20, 1918, the Government of Canada created the Canadian National Railways (CNR) – a body with no corporate powers – through Order in Council as a means to simplify the funding and operation of the various railway companies. The absorption of the Intercolonial Railway would see CNR adopt that system&#x27;s slogan, &quot;The People&#x27;s Railway&quot;.
:* Another Canadian railway, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTPR), encountered financial difficulty on March 7, 1919, when its parent company Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) defaulted on repayment of construction loans to the Government of Canada.

The Canadian National Railway Company then evolved through the following steps:

:* the &quot;railways, works and undertakings of the Companies comprised in the Canadian Northern System&quot; were vested in the newly incorporated Company in June 1919, with provision for the later inclusion of any of the Government Railways
:* vesting of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway System in the Minister of Railways and Canals, acting as Government Receiver, in March 1919
:* acquisition of the Grand Trunk Railway System in November 1919, implemented in May 1920

GTR management and shareholders opposed to nationalization took legal action, but after several years of arbitration, the GTR was finally absorbed into the CNR on January 30, 1923. Although several smaller independent railways would be added to the CNR in subsequent years as they went bankrupt or it became politically expedient to do so, the system was more or less finalized at that point. However, certain related lawsuits were not resolved until as late as 1936.

Canadian National Railways was born out of both wartime and domestic urgency. Until the rise of the personal automobile and creation of taxpayer-funded all-weather highways, railways were the only viable long-distance land transportation available in Canada. As such, their operation consumed a great deal of public and political attention. Canada was one of many nations to engage in railway nationalization in order to safeguard critical transportation infrastructure during the First World War.

In the early 20th century, many governments were taking a more interventionist role in the economy, foreshadowing the influence of economists like John Maynard Keynes. This political trend, combined with broader geo-political events, made nationalization an appealing choice for Canada. The Winnipeg General Strike of 1919 and allied involvement in the Russian Revolution seemed to validate the continuing process. The need for a viable rail system was paramount in a time of civil unrest and foreign military action.

===Acquisitions===
Bessemer &amp; Lake Erie Railroad

The B&amp;LE was acquired with the purchase of Great Lakes Transportation and the DM&amp;IR.

British Columbia Railway

In 2003, BCOL sold to Canadian National and leased the railroad to CN for 60 years.

Central Vermont Railway

Central Vermont was nationalized in 1918 and consolidated into the Grand Trunk Western in 1971 with the creation of the Grand Trunk Corporation.

Duluth Missabe &amp; Iron Range Railroad

The DM&amp;IR was purchased by Great Lakes Transportation and in 2011 the DM&amp;IR was merged into CN&#x27;s Wisconsin Central Subsidiary. The DM&amp;IR was acquired at the same time as the Bessemer &amp; Lake Erie Railroad.

Duluth Winnipeg &amp; Pacific Railroad

The DWP was nationalized with CN in 1918 and became a part of CN&#x27;s Grand Trunk Corporation in 1971. In 2011 the DWP was merged into the larger Wisconsin Central Subsidiary of CN.

Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway

In 2009, CN acquired the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway to assist with traffic congestion in Chicago and the surrounding area. In 2013 EJ&amp;E was merged into the greater Wisconsin Central Subsidiary of CN.

Grand Trunk Western Railroad

The GTW was merged with Central Vermont in 1971 with the creation of the Grand Trunk Corporation. In 1991 the GTW was merged with CN under the &quot;North America&quot; consolidation program. Many of GTWs locomotives and rolling stock would be repainted and the motive power would get the new CN scheme.

Illinois Central Railroad

In 1998, IC was purchased by CN, which also acquired the Chicago Central in the deal. A year later, the two railroads were formally amalgamated into the CN system.

Iowa Northern Railway

In 2023, CN acquired the Iowa Northern Railway, but the transaction is awaiting approval by the Surface Transportation Board (STB).

Mackenzie Northern Railway

In 2006, CN acquired Mackenzie Northern Railway, previously purchased by RailAmerica. This purchase allowed CN to increase their network footprint and hold the northernmost trackage of the contiguous North American railway network. Since being purchased by CN in 2006, it has been officially known as the Meander River Subdivision.

Newfoundland Railway
On 31 March 1949, CNR acquired the assets of the Newfoundland Railway, which in 1979 were reorganized into Terra Transport. CN officially abandoned its rail network in Newfoundland on 1 October 1988.

Savage Alberta Railway

On December 1, 2006, CN announced that it had purchased Savage Alberta Railway for $25 million and that it had begun operating the railway the same day.

TransX Group of Companies

In 2018, CN acquired the Winnipeg-based TransX Group of Companies. Transx continues to operate independently.

Wisconsin Central Railroad

In January 2001, CN acquired the WC for $800 million.

===CN&#x27;s U.S. subsidiaries prior to privatization===
CN&#x27;s railway network in the late 1980s consisted of the company&#x27;s Canadian trackage, along with the following U.S. subsidiary lines: Grand Trunk Western Railroad (GTW) operating in Michigan, Indiana, and Illinois; Duluth, Winnipeg and Pacific Railway (DWP) operating in Minnesota; Central Vermont Railway (CV) operating down the Connecticut River valley from Quebec to Long Island Sound; and the Berlin subdivision to Portland, Maine, known informally as the &quot;Grand Trunk Eastern&quot;, sold to a short-line operator in 1989.

===Privatization===
In 1992, a new management team led by ex-federal government bureaucrats, Paul Tellier and Michael Sabia, started preparing CN for privatization by emphasizing increased productivity. This was achieved largely through aggressive cuts to the company&#x27;s management structure, widescale layoffs in its workforce and continued abandonment or sale of its branch lines. In 1993 and 1994, the company experimented with a rebranding that saw the names &quot;CN&quot;, &quot;Grand Trunk Western&quot;, and &quot;Duluth, Winnipeg, and Pacific&quot; replaced under a collective CN North America moniker. In this time, CPR and CN entered into negotiations regarding a possible merger of the two companies. This was later rejected by the Government of Canada, whereupon CPR offered to purchase outright all of CN&#x27;s lines from Ontario to Nova Scotia, while an unidentified U.S. railroad (rumoured to have been Burlington Northern Railroad) would purchase CN&#x27;s lines in western Canada. This too was rejected. In 1995, the entire company including its U.S. subsidiaries reverted to using CN exclusively.

The &quot;CN Commercialization Act&quot; was enacted into law on July 13, 1995, and by November 28, 1995, the Government of Canada had completed an initial public offering (IPO) and transferred all of its shares to private investors. Two key prohibitions in this legislation include, 1) that no individual or corporate shareholder may own more than 15% of CN, and 2) that the company&#x27;s headquarters must remain in Montreal, thus maintaining CN as a Canadian corporation.

===Contraction and expansion since privatization===
Following the successful IPO, CN has recorded impressive gains in its stock price, largely through an aggressive network rationalization and purchase of newer more fuel-efficient locomotives. Numerous branch lines were shed in the late 1990s across Canada, resulting in dozens of independent short line railway companies being established to operate former CN track that had been considered marginal. This network rationalization resulted in a core east–west freight railway stretching from Halifax to Chicago and Toronto to Vancouver and Prince Rupert. The railway also operated trains from Winnipeg to Chicago using trackage rights for part of the route south of Duluth.

In addition to the rationalization in Canada, the company also expanded in a strategic north–south direction in the central United States. In 1998, in an era of mergers in the U.S. rail industry, CN bought the Illinois Central Railroad (IC), which connected the already existing lines from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Halifax, Nova Scotia, with a line running from Chicago, Illinois, to New Orleans, Louisiana. This single purchase of IC transformed CN&#x27;s entire corporate focus from being an east–west uniting presence within Canada (sometimes to the detriment of logical business models) into a north–south &quot;NAFTA&quot; railway (in reference to the North American Free Trade Agreement). CN was then feeding Canadian raw material exports into the U.S. heartland and beyond to Mexico through a strategic alliance with Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS).

In 1999, CN and BNSF Railway, the second largest rail system in the U.S., announced their intent to merge, forming a new corporate entity &quot;North American Railways&quot;, headquartered in Montreal to conform to the &quot;CN Commercialization Act&quot; of 1995. The merger announcement by CN&#x27;s Paul Tellier and BNSF&#x27;s Robert Krebs was greeted with skepticism by the U.S. government&#x27;s Surface Transportation Board (STB), and protested by other major North American rail companies, namely CPR and Union Pacific Railroad (UP). Rail customers also denounced the proposed merger, following the confusion and poor service sustained in southeastern Texas in 1998 following UP&#x27;s purchase of Southern Pacific Railroad two years earlier. In response to the rail industry, shippers, and political pressure, the STB placed a 15-month moratorium on all rail-industry mergers, effectively scuttling CN-BNSF plans. Both companies dropped their merger applications and have never refiled.
After the STB moratorium expired, CN purchased Wisconsin Central (WC) in 2001, which allowed the company&#x27;s rail network to encircle Lake Michigan and Lake Superior, permitting more efficient connections from Chicago to western Canada. The deal also included Canadian WC subsidiary Algoma Central Railway (ACR), giving access to Sault Ste. Marie and Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula. The purchase of Wisconsin Central also made CN the owner of EWS, the principal freight train operator in the United Kingdom.

On May 13, 2003, the provincial government of British Columbia announced the provincial Crown corporation, BC Rail (BCR), would be sold with the winning bidder receiving BCR&#x27;s surface operating assets (locomotives, cars, and service facilities). The provincial government is retaining ownership of the tracks and right-of-way. On November 25, 2003, it was announced CN&#x27;s bid of billion would be accepted over those of CPR and several U.S. companies. The transaction was closed effective July 15, 2004. Many opponents – including CPR – accused the government and CN of rigging the bidding process, though this has been denied by the government. Documents relating to the case are under court seal, as they are connected to a parallel marijuana grow-op investigation connected with two senior government aides also involved in the sale of BC Rail.

Also contested was the economic stimulus package the government gave cities along the BC Rail route. Some saw it as a buy-off to get the municipalities to cooperate with the lease, though the government asserted the package was intended to promote economic development along the corridor. Passenger service along the route had been ended by BC Rail a few years earlier due to ongoing losses resulting from deteriorating service. The cancelled passenger service has subsequently been replaced by a blue-plate tourist service, the Rocky Mountaineer, with fares well over double what the BCR coach fares had been.

CN also announced in October 2003 an agreement to purchase Great Lakes Transportation (GLT), a holding company owned by Blackstone Group for US$380 million. GLT was the owner of Bessemer &amp; Lake Erie Railroad, Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway (DM&amp;I), and the Pittsburgh &amp; Conneaut Dock Company. The key instigator for the deal was the fact that since the Wisconsin Central purchase, CN was required to use DM&amp;I trackage rights for a short &quot;gap&quot; near Duluth, Minnesota, on the route between Chicago and Winnipeg. To purchase this short section, CN was told by GLT it would have to purchase the entire company. Also included in GLT&#x27;s portfolio were eight Great Lakes vessels for transporting bulk commodities such as coal and iron ore as well as various port facilities. Following Surface Transportation Board approval for the transaction, CN completed the purchase of GLT on May 10, 2004.

On December 24, 2008, the STB approved CN&#x27;s purchase for $300 million of the principal lines of the Elgin, Joliet &amp; Eastern Railway Company (EJ&amp;E) (reporting mark EJE) from the U.S. Steel Corporation, originally announced on September 27, 2007. The STB&#x27;s decision was to become effective on January 23, 2009, with a closure of the transaction shortly thereafter. The EJ&amp;E lines create a bypass around the western side of heavily congested Chicago-area rail hub and its conversion to use for mainline freight traffic is expected to alleviate substantial bottlenecks for both regional and intercontinental rail traffic subject to lengthy delays entering and exiting Chicago freight yards. The purchase of the lightly used EJ&amp;E corridor was positioned by CN as a boon not only for its own business but for the efficiency of the entire U.S. rail system.

On December 31, 2011, CN completed the merger of DM&amp;I, DWP, and WC into its Wisconsin Central Ltd. subsidiary.

In March 2021, CN subsidiary WCL reached a deal to sell roughly of non-core rail lines and assets in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Ontario to short-line operator Watco.

In April 2021, CN bid nearly $30 billion for Kansas City Southern (KCS), ostensibly creating a bidding war between itself and CPR, who had placed a $25 billion bid for the company in March. CN&#x27;s offer represented a 21% premium to the one made by Canadian Pacific, offering $325 for each share and including $200 in cash. The move by CN was influenced by the projected economic upturn once the world began to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, with KCS&#x27;s railroad network reaching from Canada, through the United States, and running along the Panama Canal. On May 21, CN and KCS agreed to merge, but lengthy regulatory approvals are required to put it into effect. However, on August 31, the US Surface Transportation Board (STB) denied a voting trust between CN and KCS. With the decision by the STB, KCS re-engaged with CP on CP&#x27;s original offer. The merger between the Kansas City Southern and Canadian Pacific Railway was ultimately approved on March 15, 2023, and the two railroads merged on April 14, 2023.

After losing the battle against CP for the purchase of KCS, in hearings before the STB for the CP-KCS merger, CN filed a plan to acquire the KCS line linking Kansas City with Springfield, IL, St. Louis, MO and East St. Louis, IL, the former Gateway Western, tie it to its former IC Gilman Subdivision, and thus create a new corridor between Kansas City and St. Louis with Michigan and Eastern Canada, bypassing Chicago, and which, according to the plan presented by CN, divert 80,000 long haul-truck shipments to rail annually. A few months later, CN resigned its intentions to purchase the Springfield Line in order to try to obtain trackage rights on the line, always with the same intention of creating the corridor proposed in the original plan to purchase the line filed with the STB. Both the initial plan to purchase the line and the subsequent plan to acquire trackage rights included the execution of corridor improvement works, valued at more than US$250 million. The STB would ultimately reject plans submitted by CN to operate on the Springfield Line.

Due to a failure to reach an agreement with the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference Canadian National&#x27;s Canadian operations, along with those of CPKC, shut down from August 22, 2024 as the companies engaged in a lockout.

==CN today==
Since the company operates in two countries, CN maintains some corporate distinction by having its U.S. lines incorporated under the Delaware-domiciled Grand Trunk Corporation for legal purposes; however, the entire company in both Canada and the U.S. operates under CN, as can be seen in its locomotive and rail car repainting programs.

Since the Illinois Central purchase in 1998, CN has been increasingly focused on running a &quot;scheduled freight railroad/railway&quot;. This has resulted in improved shipper relations, as well as reduced the need for maintaining pools of surplus locomotives and freight cars. CN has also undertaken a rationalization of its existing track network by removing double track sections in some areas and extending passing sidings in other areas.

CN is also a rail industry leader in the employment of radio-control (R/C) for switching locomotives in yards, resulting in reductions to the number of yard workers required. CN has frequently been touted in recent years within North American rail industry circles as being the &quot;most-improved railroad&quot; in terms of productivity and the lowering of its operating ratio, acknowledging the fact the company is becoming increasingly profitable. Due to the rising popularity of ethanol, shuttle trains, and mineral commodities, CN Rail Service is increasing in popularity.

In 2011, the company was added to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index.

===Projects===
In April 2012 a plan was announced to build an railway that would run north from Sept-Îles, Quebec; the railway would support mining and other resource extraction in the Labrador Trough.

In September 2012, CN announced the trial of locomotives fuelled by natural gas as a potential alternative to conventional diesel fuel. Two EMD SD40 diesel-electric locomotives fuelled with 90% natural gas and 10% diesel were tested in service between Edmonton and Fort McMurray, Alberta.

===Controversies===
====Accidents====
*in 1986 near Dalehurst, Alberta, a CN westbound freight slammed into a Via Rail eastbound, killing 23 and injuring 71. The wreck was caused due to multiple factors caused by CN.
*In December 1999 the &quot;Ultratrain&quot;, a petroleum products unit train linking the Levis (Quebec) Ultramar oil refinery with a petroleum depot in Montreal, derailed into the path of an oncoming freight train, travelling in the opposite direction between Sainte-Madeleine and Saint-Hilaire-Est, south of Montreal. The two crew members on the freight train were killed in the ensuing explosion (the crew&#x27;s last words were &quot;you guys are derailed, we&#x27;re hitting you!&quot;). The Ultratrain derailed at a broken rail caused by a defective weld that was not fixed in time, despite being repeatedly reported by train crews; the report by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada called into question CN&#x27;s quality assurance program for rail welds as well as the lack of detection equipment for defective wheels. In memory of the dead crewmen, two new stations on the line have been named after them (Davis and Thériault).
*On May 14, 2003, a trestle collapsed under the weight of a freight train near McBride, British Columbia, killing both crew members. Both men had been disciplined earlier for refusing to take another train on the same bridge, claiming it was unsafe. It was revealed that as far back as 1999, several bridge components had been reported as rotten, yet no repairs had been ordered by management. Eventually, the disciplinary records of both crewmen were amended posthumously.
*Two CN trains collided on August 4, 2007, on the banks of the Fraser River near Prince George, British Columbia. Several cars carrying gasoline, diesel and lumber burst into flames. Water bombers were used to help put out the fires. Some fuel had seeped into the Fraser River.

====Derailments====
*On May 27, 2002, a CN train derailed at 12:30 p.m. north of Vermontville Highway in Potterville, Michigan. The train was hauling a total of 58 cars. Thirty-five of the cars derailed and 11 of them contained hazmat material. Nine were carrying propane and two cars carried sulfuric acid. Two of the propane tankers were leaking and a third was suspected of leaking. Each propane car contains 34,000 gallons of propane gas which is considered an extreme fire and explosive hazard. An evacuation of Potterville was declared. CN along with other agencies worked throughout the week to clean the area.
*A second CN train derailment in Potterville, Michigan, occurred in May 2006, though no evacuation was necessary. The cause of this derailment was found to be a failed wheel bearing on the 82nd car.
*About 9:04 am central standard time on February 9, 2003, northbound CN freight train M33371 derailed 22 of its 108 cars in Tamaroa, Illinois. Four of the derailed cars released methanol, and the methanol from two of these four cars fueled a fire. Other derailed cars contained phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, formaldehyde, and vinyl chloride. Two cars containing hydrochloric acid, one car containing formaldehyde, and one car containing vinyl chloride released product but were not involved in the fire. About 850 residents were evacuated from the area within a radius of the derailment, which included the entire village of Tamaroa. Improper placement of bond wire welds on the head of the rail just outside the joint bars, where untempered martensite associated with the welds led to fatigue and subsequent cracking that, because of increased stresses associated with known soft ballast conditions, rapidly progressed to rail failure.
*On August 5, 2005, in the Cheakamus River derailment, a CN train had nine cars derail on a bridge over the Cheakamus River, causing of caustic soda to spill into the river, killing thousands of fish by caustic burns and asphyxiation. The CBC reported environmental experts say it would take the river 50 years or more to recover from the toxic pollution. CN is facing accusations from local British Columbians over the railway&#x27;s supposed lack of response to this issue, touted as the worst chemical spill in British Columbia&#x27;s history.
*A derailment at Moran, north of Lillooet, on June 30, 2006, has raised more questions about CN&#x27;s safety policies. Two more derailments near Lytton in August 2006 have continued criticism. In the first case, 20 coal cars of a CPR train using a CN bridge derailed, dumping 12 cars of coal into the Thompson River. In the second case half a dozen grain cars spilled on a CN train.
*On June 19, 2009, a CN freight train derailed at a highway/rail grade crossing in Cherry Valley, Illinois (near Rockford). The train consisted of two locomotives and 114 cars, 19 of which derailed. All of the derailed cars were tank cars carrying denatured fuel ethanol, a flammable liquid, and thirteen were breached or lost product and caught fire. As a result of the fire that erupted after the derailment, a passenger in a car stopped at the crossing was fatally injured, two passengers in the same car received serious injuries, and five occupants of other cars waiting at the highway/rail crossing were injured. Two responding firefighters also sustained minor injuries. The release of ethanol and the resulting fire prompted a mandatory evacuation of about 600 residences within a radius of the accident site. Monetary damages were estimated to total $7.9 million. The probable cause of the accident was the washout of the track structure that was discovered about 1 hour before the train&#x27;s arrival, and CN&#x27;s failure to notify the train crew of the known washout in time to stop the train. Contributing factors were CN&#x27;s failure to work with Winnebago County to develop a comprehensive storm water management plan to address previous washouts, CN&#x27;s failure to issue the flash flood warning to the train crew, and the inadequate design of the train&#x27;s DOT-111 tank cars.

====Disputes====
*In March 2004 a strike by the Canadian Auto Workers union showed deep-rooted divisions between organized labour and the company&#x27;s current management.
*Transport Canada has restricted CN to trains not exceeding 80 car lengths because of the multiple derailments on the former BCR line north from Squamish. This was due to sufficient warnings from the former B.C. Rail to Canadian National Railway to avoid trains of over 60 cars. Unfortunately these warnings were ignored by CN who had been running trains well in excess of 80 cars on this winding and mountainous section of track, known for some of the steepest track in North America.
*In October 2013 the James Street bridge between Thunder Bay and Fort William First Nation was subject to an act of arson causing great structural damage to the bridge. The bridge was the most direct route between Thunder Bay and Fort William First Nation reserve and was used by foot traffic, vehicular traffic, and rail traffic. The matter of who is responsible for the maintenance and repair of the bridge is subject to great controversy between the City of Thunder Bay and CN due to an agreement dating back to 1906 between the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company (later incorporated as CNR along with other railways) and the City of Fort William (later merged with the City of Port Arthur into the City of Thunder Bay). The 1906 Agreement states that &quot;The Company will give the Municipal Corporation the perpetual right to cross said bridge for ... vehicle and foot traffic&quot; and that &quot;The Company will maintain the bridge in perpetuity without cost to the Town ...&quot;. After the fire, CN made repairs to the bridge for use of its rail system but did not repair the damage to the vehicle lanes which render it unsafe for vehicle use. CN maintains that the 1906 Agreement does not speak to replacement of the bridge while the position of the City of Thunder Bay is that CN is solely responsible for making the necessary repairs to restore function to the vehicle lanes of the bridge.
*At 12:01 a.m. on August 22, 2024, CN shut its operations and locked out thousands of Teamsters Canada union members. The lockout, however, lasted for less than a full day: By the afternoon of August 22, the Canadian government ordered CN to end the lockout and to arbitrate with its labor union.

====Other incidents====
*Controversy arose again in Canadian political circles in 2003 following the company&#x27;s decision to refer solely to its acronym &quot;CN&quot; and not &quot;Canadian National&quot;, a move some interpret as being an attempt to distance the company from references to &quot;Canada&quot;. Canada&#x27;s Minister of Transport at the time called this policy move &quot;obscene&quot; after nationalists noted it could be argued the company is no longer Canadian, being primarily owned by American stockholders. The controversy is somewhat tempered by the fact a majority of large corporations are being increasingly referred to by acronyms.

*The residents of Wabamun Lake, in Alberta, staged a blockade of CN tracks in August 2005, when they were unsatisfied with the railway&#x27;s response to a derailment catastrophe that spilled over 700,000 Litres of tarry fuel oil and about 80,000 L of carcinogenic pole treatment oil into the lake. Reporters found pre-spill evidence. CN executives admitted CN failed to provide public safety information to prevent public exposure to carcinogenic, toxic chemicals. The tar-like oil and chemicals killed over 500 large migratory birds, animals, fish and other aquatic life.
*In the years following CN&#x27;s 1998 acquisition of Illinois Central, the company has come under scrutiny for illicit practices that allegedly cause the delay of Amtrak schedules. In 2012, Amtrak filed a formal complaint against CN with the Surface Transportation Board, stating that the prioritization of freight traffic over passenger traffic was commonplace on Amtrak routes operating on CN lines. The complaint cited over 4,000 delays during fiscal year 2011 on the route between Chicago and Carbondale, totaling over 26 days of net wasted schedule time; it also reported 99% of delays between Chicago and New Orleans on the &quot;City of New Orleans route&quot; were caused by CN dispatching issues. In 2018, Amtrak began issuing public report cards, grading the impact of freight railroads on passenger train performance. CN received the lowest-possible grade of &quot;F&quot; on the first card issued in March 2018.

==== Offences ====
*On June 15, 2017, CN pleaded guilty in the Provincial Court of Alberta to one offence under the Fisheries Act and three offences under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. It was fined $2.5 million for being non-compliant with a number of requirements under the Storage Tank Systems for Petroleum and Allied Petroleum Products Regulations, which caused an estimated 90 litres of diesel to be released into Edmonton&#x27;s storm sewer.
*On September 15, 2021, CN pleaded guilty in Prince Rupert Provincial Court to a charge of violating the Fisheries Act and fined $2.5 million for spraying pesticides along its rail line, which runs along the Skeena River and over many tributaries and wetlands in British Columbia, which were found to be deleterious to fish.

== Non-rail subsidiaries ==

===CN Telegraph===
CN Telegraph originated as the Great North West Telegraph Company in 1880 to connect Ontario and Manitoba and became a subsidiary of Western Union in 1881. In 1915, facing bankruptcy, GNWTC was acquired by the Canadian Northern Railway&#x27;s telegraph company. When Canadian Northern was nationalized in 1918 and amalgamated into Canadian National Railways in 1921, its telegraph arm was renamed the Canadian National Telegraph Company. CN Telegraphs began co-operating with its Canadian Pacific-owned rival CPR Telegraphs in the 1930s, sharing telegraph networks and co-founding a teleprinter system in 1957. In 1967 the two services were amalgamated into a joint venture CNCP Telecommunications which evolved into a telecoms company. CN sold its stake of the company to CP in 1984.

===CNR Radio===
In 1923 CNR&#x27;s second president, Sir Henry Thornton who succeeded David Blyth Hanna (1919–1922), created the CNR Radio Department to provide passengers with entertainment radio reception and give the railway a competitive advantage over its rival, CP. This led to the creation of a network of CNR radio stations across the country, North America&#x27;s first radio network. As anyone in the vicinity of a station could hear its broadcasts the network&#x27;s audience extended far beyond train passengers to the public at large.

Claims of unfair competition from CP as well as pressure on the government to create a public broadcasting system similar to the British Broadcasting Corporation led the government of R. B. Bennett (who had been a corporate lawyer with Canadian Pacific as a client prior to entering politics) to pressure CNR into ending its on-train radio service in 1931 and then withdrawing from the radio business entirely in 1933. CNR&#x27;s radio assets were sold for $50,000 to a new public broadcaster, the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission, which in turn became the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 1936.

===CN Hotels===
Canadian railways built and operated their own resort hotels, ostensibly to provide rail passengers travelling long distances a place to sleep overnight. These hotels became attractions in and of themselves – a place for a rail passenger to go for a holiday. As each railway company sought to be more attractive than its competitors, they made their hotels more attractive and luxurious.
Canadian National Hotels was the CNRs chain of hotels and was a combination of hotels inherited by the CNR when it acquired various railways and structures built by the CNR itself. The chain&#x27;s principal rival was Canadian Pacific Hotels.

===Canadian National Steamship Company===

Canadian National operated a fleet of passenger and cargo vessels on both the West Coast and East Coast of Canada which operated under a branch of the company known as Canadian National Steamships, later CN Marine.

====West Coast====
Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson of Wallsend, England, built and for the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway in 1910. In 1930 Cammell Laird of Birkenhead, England, built , &quot;Prince Henry&quot; and &quot;Prince Robert&quot;. &quot;Prince Henry&quot; was sold in 1937. &quot;Prince George&quot; was destroyed by fire in 1945. &quot;Prince David&quot; and &quot;Prince Robert&quot; were requisitioned in 1939 as Royal Canadian Navy armed merchant cruisers, converted into landing ships in 1943, and sold in 1948. In 1948 a second &quot;Prince George&quot; was built by Yarrows Limited, becoming CN&#x27;s sole remaining Pacific Coast passenger liner. She was switched from scheduled routes to pleasure cruises, and was the last CN ship that served the west coast. After a fire in 1975 she was sold in 1976 (first to British Columbia Steamship Company and finally Wong Brother Enterprises) before finally being sold to Chinese breakers in 1995 (and sank on her way to China in 1996 in Unimak Pass).

=====Former Canadian Northern Pacific ships=====
* was built in 1918 for the Canadian Northern Pacific&#x27;s Patricia Bay to Port Mann route. In 1919 the ship became part of Canadian National.

=====Former Grand Trunk Pacific steamships=====
These ships served the Pacific coast with GTP until Canadian National took possession of them in 1925:
* (1910–56)
* (1910–45) – Caught fire and destroyed in 1945.
*&quot;Prince Albert&quot;
*&quot;Prince John&quot;

=====CN-built steamships for the West Coast=====
Ships specially built for CN for the West Coast. After the Second World War steamship service had dropped and by the 1950s the ships were withdrawn. &quot;Prince George&quot; (II) stayed in service, but to do cruises on the West Coast. By 1975 &quot;Prince George&quot; (II) was retired, ending CN&#x27;s steamship era on the West Coast.
* 
* &quot;Prince Charles&quot;
* &quot;Prince William&quot;
* (II) (1948–1975) – Built and replaced the first &quot;Prince George&quot; after it caught fire in 1945. &quot;Prince George&quot; (II) was the last ship that served the west coast for CN.

====East Coast====
In 1928–29 Cammell Laird built a set of five ships for CN to carry mail, passengers and freight between eastern Canada and the Caribbean via Bermuda. Each ship was named after the wife of an English or British admiral who was noted for his actions in the Caribbean, and who had been knighted or ennobled. They were therefore nicknamed the &quot;Lady&quot;-liners or &quot;Lady&quot;-boats. along with and were designed for service to the eastern islands of the British West Indies and had larger passenger capacity but lesser cargo capacity than and who were built for service to western islands. In the Second World War &quot;Lady Somers&quot; was requisitioned as an ocean boarding vessel while her four sister ships continued in CN service. The sank Lady Somers in 1941. and &quot;Lady Drake&quot; were sunk by German U-boats in 1942. &quot;Lady Nelson&quot; was torpedoed in 1942 but refloated and converted to a hospital ship, while &quot;Lady Rodney&quot; survived the war unscathed. The two surviving Lady Boats, Nelson and Rodney, were sold in 1952 after declining passenger traffic and rising labour costs made them too expensive to run.

====Cargo ships====
In 1928 CN took over most of the fleet of Canadian Government Merchant Marine Ltd, giving it a fleet of about 45 cargo ships. When France surrendered to Germany in June 1940 the Canadian Government seized CGT&#x27;s MV &quot;Maurienne&quot; and contracted CN to manage her.

===Aquatrain===
CN operated a rail barge service between Prince Rupert, British Columbia, to Whittier, Alaska, from 1963 to 2021.

==Corporate governance==
Robert Pace is the chair of the CNR board. The other board members are Donald J. Carty, V. Maureen Kempston Darkes, Gordon D. Giffin, Edith E. Holiday, Luc Jobin, Denis Losier, Kevin G. Lynch, James E. O&#x27;Connor, Robert L. Phillips, and Laura Stein.

===Heads of the corporation===
Thornton and Harrison were the only non-Canadians to head CN.

=== 1900s ===
From 1919 to 1995, CN was also the responsibility of the relevant federal cabinet minister as a Crown Corporation:

* 1919–1936 – Minister of Railways and Canals
* 1936–present – Minister of Transport

=== 2000s ===
Claude Mongeau was president and CEO from 2010 to 2016, previously serving as CFO for almost a decade. His tenure was marked by early praise from leadership for his working on the tracks for several months alongside the company&#x27;s railroaders. He was also credited with implementing precision railroading.

However, mainline derailments increased in the middle of his tenure, resulting in his bonus being capped. Operating ratio also declined during his time as CEO. He resigned in 2016 after being diagnosed with throat cancer, and the board appointed Luc Jobin to replace him.

During his tenure, Jobin joined the board of British American Tobacco in 2017. In 2018, Jobin resigned &quot;as the railway struggles through operational and customer service challenges,&quot; CBC wrote.

==Passenger trains==
===Early years===
When CNR was first created, it inherited a large number of routes from its constituent railways, but eventually pieced its passenger network into one coherent network. For example, on December 3, 1920, CNR inaugurated the &quot;Continental Limited&quot;, which operated over four of its predecessors, as well as the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway. The 1920s saw growth in passenger travel, and CNR inaugurated several new routes and introduced new services, such as radio, on its trains. However, the growth in passenger travel ended with the Great Depression, which lasted between 1929 and 1939, but picked up somewhat in World War II. By the end of World War II, many of CNR&#x27;s passenger cars were old and worn down. Accidents at Dugald, Manitoba, in 1947 and Canoe River, British Columbia, in 1950, wherein extra passenger trains composed of older, wooden equipment collided with transcontinental passenger trains composed of newer, all-steel equipment, demonstrated the dangers inherent in the older cars. In 1953, CNR ordered 359 lightweight passenger cars, allowing them to re-equip their major routes.

On April 24, 1955, the same day that the CPR introduced its transcontinental train &quot;The Canadian&quot;, CNR introduced its own new transcontinental passenger train, the &quot;Super Continental&quot;, which used new streamlined rolling stock. However, the &quot;Super Continental&quot; was never considered as glamorous as the &quot;Canadian&quot;. For example, it did not include dome cars. Dome cars would be added in the early 1960s with the purchase of six former Milwaukee Road &quot;Super Domes&quot;. They were used on the &quot;Super Continental&quot; in the summer tourist season.

===New services===
Rail passenger traffic in Canada declined significantly between World War II and 1960 due to automobiles and airplanes. In the 1960s CN&#x27;s privately owned rival CPR reduced its passenger services significantly. However, the government-owned CN continued much of its passenger services and marketed new schemes. One, introduced on 5 April 1962, was the &quot;Red, White and Blue&quot; fare structure, which offered deep discounts on off-peak days (&quot;red&quot;) and were credited with increasing passenger numbers on some routes as much as 600%. Another exercise was the rebranding of the express trains in the Ontario–Quebec corridor with the Rapido label.

In 1968, CN introduced a new high-speed train, the United Aircraft Turbo, which was powered by gas turbines instead of diesel engines. It made the trip between Toronto and Montreal in four hours, but was not entirely successful because it was somewhat uneconomical and not always reliable. The trainsets were retired in 1982 and later scrapped at Metrecy, in Laval, Quebec.

On CN&#x27;s narrow gauge lines in Newfoundland, CN also operated a main line passenger train that ran from St. John&#x27;s to Port aux Basques called the &quot;Caribou&quot;. Nicknamed the &quot;Newfie Bullett&quot;, this train ran until June 1969. It was replaced by the CN Roadcruiser Buses. The CN Roadcruiser service was started in fall 1968 and was run in direct competition with the company&#x27;s own passenger train. Travellers saw that the buses could travel between St. John&#x27;s and Port aux Basques in 14 hours versus the train&#x27;s 22 hours. After the demise of the &quot;Caribou&quot;, the only passenger train service run by CN on the island were the mixed (freight and passenger) trains that ran on the Bonavista, Carbonear and Argentia branch lines. The only passenger service surviving on the main line was between Bishop&#x27;s Falls and Corner Brook.

In 1976, CN created an entity called &quot;Via-CN&quot; as a separate operating unit for its passenger services. Via evolved into a coordinated marketing effort with CP Rail for rail passenger services, and later into a separate Crown corporation responsible for inter-city passenger services in Canada. Via Rail took over CN&#x27;s passenger services on April 1, 1978.

===Decline===
CN continued to fund its commuter rail services in Montreal until 1982, when the Montreal Urban Community Transit Commission (MUCTC) assumed financial responsibility for them; operation was contracted out to CN, which eventually spun off a separate subsidiary, Montrain, for this purpose. When the Montreal–Deux-Montagnes line was completely rebuilt in 1994–1995, the new rolling stock came under the ownership of the MUCTC, until a separate government agency, the Agence métropolitaine de transport (now AMT), was set up to consolidate all suburban transit administration around Montreal. Since then, suburban service has resumed to Saint-Hilaire, and a new line to Mascouche opened in December 2014.

In Newfoundland, Terra Transport would continue to operate the mixed trains on the branch lines until 1984. The main line run between Corner Brook and Bishop&#x27;s Falls made its last run on September 30, 1988. Terra Transport/CN would run the Roadcruiser bus service until March 29, 1996, whereupon the bus service was sold off to DRL Coachlines of Triton, Newfoundland.

===Expansion and service cuts===
From the acquisition of the Algoma Central Railway in 2001 until service cancellation in July 2015, CN operated passenger service between Sault Ste. Marie and Hearst, Ontario. The passenger service operated three days per week and provided year-round access to remote tourist camps and resorts.

In January 2014, CN announced it was cutting the service, blaming the Government of Canada for cutting a subsidy necessary to keep the service running. It was argued as an essential service; however, the service had always been deemed financially uneconomic, and despite an extension of funding in April 2014, Algoma Central service was suspended as of July 2015.

CN operates the Agawa Canyon Tour excursion, an excursion that runs from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, north to the Agawa Canyon. The canyon tour train consists of up to 28 passenger cars and 2 dining cars, the majority of which were built for CN by Canadian Car and Foundry in 1953–54. These cars were transferred to the D&amp;RGW Ski Train and bought back by CN in 2009.

After CN acquired BC Rail in 2004, it started operating a railbus service between Seton Portage and Lillooet, British Columbia called the Kaoham Shuttle.

CN crews used to operate commuter trains on behalf of GO Transit in the Toronto and the surrounding vicinity. This changed in 2008 when a deal was reached with Bombardier Transportation that switched all CN crews for Bombardier crews.

==Locomotives==
===Steam===
The CNR acquired its first 4-8-4 &quot;Confederation&quot; locomotives in 1927. Over the next 20 years, it ordered over 200 for passenger and heavy freight service. The CNR also used several 4-8-2 &quot;Mountain&quot; locomotives, almost exclusively for passenger service. No. 6060, a streamlined 4-8-2, was the last CN steam locomotive, running in excursion service in the 1970s. CNR also used several 2-8-2 &quot;Mikado&quot; locomotives.

===Electric===

CN inherited from the Canadian Northern Railway several boxcab electrics used through the Mount Royal Tunnel. Those were built between 1914 and 1918 by General Electric in Schenectady, New York. To operate the new Montreal Central Station, which opened in 1943 and was to be kept free of locomotive smoke, they were supplemented by nearly identical locomotives from the National Harbours Board; those engines were built in 1924 by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company and English Electric. In 1950, three General Electric centre-cab electric locomotives were added to the fleet. In 1952 CN added electric multiple units built by Canadian Car and Foundry.

Electrification was restricted to Montreal, and went from Central Station to Saint-Lambert (south), Turcot (west), Montréal-Nord (east) and Saint-Eustache-sur-le-lac, later renamed Deux-Montagnes, (north). But as steam locomotives gave way to diesels, engine changeovers were no longer necessary, and catenary was eventually pulled from the west, east and from the south. However, until the end of the original electrification, CN&#x27;s electric locomotives pulled Via Rail&#x27;s trains, including its diesel electric locomotives, to and from Central Station.

The last 2,400 V DC CN electric locomotive ran on June 6, 1995, the very same locomotive that pulled the inaugural train through the Mount Royal Tunnel back in 1918. Later in 1995 the AMT&#x27;s Electric Multiple Units began operating under 25 kV AC 60 Hz electrification, and in 2014, dual-power locomotives entered service on the Mascouche line.

===Turbo===

In May 1966, CN ordered five seven-car UAC TurboTrain for the Montreal–Toronto service. It planned to operate them in tandem, connecting two trains together into a larger fourteen-car arrangement with a total capacity of 644 passengers. The Canadian trains were built by Montreal Locomotive Works, with their ST6 engines supplied by UAC&#x27;s Canadian division (now Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada) in Longueuil, Quebec.

CN and their ad agency wanted to promote the new service as an entirely new form of transit, so they dropped the &quot;train&quot; from the name. In CN&#x27;s marketing literature the train was referred to simply as the &quot;Turbo&quot;, although it retained the full TurboTrain name in CN&#x27;s own documentation and communication with UAC. A goal of CN&#x27;s marketing campaign was to get the train into service for Expo &#x27;67, and the Turbo was rushed through its trials. It was late for Expo, a disappointment to all involved, but the hectic pace did not let up and it was cleared for service after only one year of testing.

The Turbo&#x27;s first demonstration run in December 1968 with Conductor James Abbey of Toronto in command, included a large press contingent. An hour into its debut run, the Turbo collided with a truck at a highway crossing near Kingston.

The Turbo&#x27;s final run was on October 31, 1982.

===Diesel===
CNR&#x27;s first foray into diesel motive power was with self-propelled railcars. In November 1925, Railcar No. 15820 completed a 72-hour journey from Montreal to Vancouver with the diesel engine in nearly continuous operation for the entire trip. Railcars were used on marginal economic routes instead of the more-expensive-to-operate steam locomotives used for busier routes.

In 1929, the CNR made its first experiment with mainline diesel electric locomotives, acquiring two engines from Westinghouse, numbered 9000 and 9001. It was the first North American railway to use diesels in mainline service. These early units proved the feasibility of the diesel concept, but were not always reliable. No. 9000 served until 1939, and No. 9001 until 1947. The difficulties of the Great Depression precluded much further progress towards diesel locomotives. The CNR began its conversion to diesel locomotives after World War II, and had fully dieselized by 1960. Most of the CNR&#x27;s first-generation diesel locomotives were made by General Motors Diesel (GMD) and Montreal Locomotive Works.

For its narrow-gauge lines in Newfoundland CN acquired from GMD the 900 series, Models NF110 (road numbers 900–908) and NF210 (road numbers 909–946). For use on the branch lines, CN purchased the EMD G8 (road numbers 800–805).

For passenger service the CNR acquired GMD FP9 diesels, as well as CLC CPA16-5, ALCO MLW FPA-2 and FPA-4 diesels. These locomotives made up most of the CNR&#x27;s passenger fleet, although CN also owned some 60 RailLiners (Budd Rail Diesel Cars), some dual-purpose diesel freight locomotives (freight locomotives equipped with passenger train apparatus, such as steam generators) as well as the locomotives for the Turbo trainsets. Via acquired most of CN&#x27;s passenger fleet when it took over CN passenger service in 1978.

The CN fleet consists of 1,548 locomotives, most of which are products of either General Motors&#x27; Electro-Motive Division (EMD), or General Electric/GE Transportation Systems. Some locomotives more than 30 years old remain in service.

Much of the current roster is made up of EMD SD70I and EMD SD75I locomotives and GE C44-9W locomotives. Recently acquired are the new EMD SD70M-2 and GE ES44DC. Since 2015 the GE ES44AC &amp; GE ET44AC are the latest units.

Beginning in the early summer months of 2010, CN purchased a small order of GE C40-8&#x27;s and GE C40-8W&#x27;s from Union Pacific and BNSF Railway, respectively. The intent was to use them as a cheaper power alternative. CN currently has 65 GE ES44ACs on its roster and all 65 were ordered and delivered from December 2012 to December 2013. They are CN&#x27;s first AC-powered locomotives. In 2015, CN started ordering more GE units, the ET44AC. On November 17, 2020, CN revealed five heritage units to mark the 25th anniversary of becoming a publicly traded company. They had originally been spotted a month earlier, but were not yet formally announced by the company. The locomotives were repainted into various schemes of railroads CN had previously acquired, and included four GE ET44ACs painted in IC, EJ&amp;E, WC, and BC Rail paint, and an EMD SD70M-2 painted in GTW paint.

<text>Zamboanga Sibugay, officially the Province of Zamboanga Sibugay (; ), is a province in the Philippines located in the Zamboanga Peninsula region in Mindanao. Its capital and largest town is Ipil and it borders Zamboanga del Norte to the north, Zamboanga del Sur to the east and Zamboanga City to the southwest. To the south lies Sibuguey Bay in the Moro Gulf.

Zamboanga Sibugay is the 79th province created in the Philippines, when its territories were carved out from the third district of Zamboanga del Sur in 2001.

==History==

The earliest recorded mention of Sibugay was in &quot;Historia de las islas de Mindanao, Jolo y sus adyacentes&quot; (1667) by the Spanish priest Francisco Combés, which describes the village of &quot;Sibuguey&quot; along the river Sibuguey.

Zamboanga Sibugay was formerly part of Zamboanga del Sur. Attempts to divide Zamboanga del Sur into two separate provinces date as far back as the 1960s. Several bills were filed in the Philippine Congress, but remained unacted. 

It started in the 1960s when several bills were filed in Congress such as House Bill No. 17574 by the late Rep. Vincenzo Sagun, HB No. 8546 of Congresswoman Belma Cabilao, HB No. 341 through Congressman Vicente M. Cerilles and the Batasan Parliamentary Bill sponsored by parliament members (Antonio Ceniza, Manuel M. Espaldon, Hussien Loong, Kalbi Tupay, and Minister Romulo Espaldon). All of these bills were relegated to the recesses of the archives.

In 1993, an initiative called the Zamboanga Occidental Movement ushered in a renewed political consciousness among the people of the 3rd district of Zamboanga del Sur. The movement was so intense that a People’s Initiative was conducted simultaneously with the May 1997 Barangay Elections. In this exercise, majority of the voters signed in favor of forming a new province. It was then that Congressman George T. Hofer sponsored HB No. 1311. He managed to push the bill in Congress and gave it a new identity by naming the proposed province as Zamboanga Sibugay. He lobbied for its approval in the senate and the new province was finally created by &quot;Republic Act No. 8973&quot; signed into law by President Joseph Estrada on November 7, 2000. On February 22, 2001, R.A. 8973 was ratified through a plebiscite conducted in 44 municipalities of Zamboanga del Sur and Pagadian City. Zamboanga del Sur Third District Representative George Hofer was appointed and later elected as its first governor in 2001.

==Government==

Presently, former representative Dr. Dulce Ann K. Hofer is the governor of the province, while the representatives of the first and second districts are Wilter Palma and Antonieta &quot;Tata&quot; Eudela, respectively.

==Geography==

<doc id="260806" wikidata="Q129567" url="?curid=260806" title="Kodachrome Basin State Park">
<text>Kodachrome Basin is a state park of Utah, United States. It is situated above sea level, south of Utah Route 12, and southeast of Bryce Canyon National Park. It is accessible from the north from Cannonville by a paved road and from the south by Road 400, a dirt road from the Page, Arizona area to Cannonville, passable for most vehicles in dry conditions. A longer but paved route to Tropic from the south is also available via US-89 and SR-12.

==Geology==

The geologic interests of the park are sandstone spires and columns called sand pipes or clastic dikes, which are rarely found elsewhere. Differing geological explanations of the features in Kodachrome Basin State Park exist. One explanation is that the area was once similar to Yellowstone National Park with hot springs and geysers, which eventually filled up with sediment and solidified. Through time, the Entrada sandstone surrounding the solidified geysers eroded, leaving large sand pipes. Sixty-seven sand pipes ranging from two to 52 meters have been identified in the park.

While others suggest these sandstone spires are the result of sandstone intrusions which were created as a result of the tectonic activity in the Plio-Pleistocene time, the time of the uplift of the surrounding plateaus. Indications for this model include the concentric vertical ring structure of the columns themselves where each of the three vertical rings of sandstone, central, inner, and outer, can be traced and matched to a distinct sedimentary formation below. Also the truncation of two of the structures, at Shepherd&#x27;s Point, by Pleistocene sheet conglomerates, and other intrusions which pierce through Pleistocene river deposited conglomerates place the intrusion event in the Pleistocene. The river conglomerates are truncated by the sheet conglomerates. Sheet conglomerates are usually caused by major seismic activity. There are also quite large well-rounded clasts, ranging in size from 2.5 centimeters and greater, found along the outer layer of the sandstone spires which are from the Pleistocene river conglomerates. Smaller less rounded, more angular clasts, about a centimeter or less in width, are also found and are from the red claystones layers found in the intruded sandstones. These clearly indicate that the pierced formations were well lithified. Additionally, the area has large masses of sandstone dikes. The spires have no evidence of a chaotic, mixing flow regime, rather they indicate a laminar flow not suggestive of hot springs or geysers. The outer surface is highly lithified, but within a few millimeters, the sandstone is quite friable.

The primary argument against an intrusion event is the liquified state required for the seismic intrusions. The source sediments are Jurassic in age, therefore, it is argued, to have been lithified and unable to be liquified. But there are intrusive dikes which show liquification did occur. And the hardened red claystone layers, which are pierced, were fairly consolidated at time of the intrusion event, therefore, they required tremendous pressure in order to be pierced. Seismic pressure waves would provide such pressure. The fracturing of the claystones also suggest that the intrusive sandstones were point sources able to concentrate the fluid pressure to a small area of the overlaying rock. It is also noted that the intrusions cleanly sheared the claystones so that the concentric edge of the claystone abuts cleanly against the spires.

==History==
Evidence near the park suggests that Native Americans were the first to wander through the area. Around the turn of the 20th century, cattlemen from Cannonville and Henrieville used the basin as a winter pasture. In 1948 the National Geographic Society explored and photographed the area for a story that appeared in the September 1949 issue of &quot;National Geographic&quot;. They named the area Kodachrome Flat, after the brand of Kodak film known for its vibrant color rendition. In 1962 the area was designated a state park. Fearing repercussions from the Kodak film company for using the name Kodachrome, the name was changed to Chimney Rock State Park, but renamed Kodachrome Basin a few years later with Kodak&#x27;s permission.


==Recreational activities==
Primary recreational activities in Kodachrome Basin State Park include photography, wildlife watching, camping, and hiking the park&#x27;s several trails. Popular sites include Chimney Rock, Shakespeare Arch (which collapsed in 2019), and Ballerina Spire. Stargazing is popular as the park sees little light pollution. Grosvenor Arch, an intricate double arch located ten miles south east of the park in the Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument is a popular destination for many visitors. Kodachrome Basin State Park has 55 campsites, two of which are group sites as well as available showers. Campsites can be reserved at Reserve America. There are also two bunkhouse cabins inside the state park for lodging, managed by the park. Horseback rides are also available throughout the park and surrounding wilderness areas.
==Climate==
Kodachrome Basin State Park has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;) with cold winters, warm to hot summers, and large diurnal temperature variation throughout the year.

<text>The Entrada Sandstone is a formation in the San Rafael Group found in the U.S. states of Wyoming, Colorado, northwest New Mexico, northeast Arizona, and southeast Utah. Part of the Colorado Plateau, this formation was deposited during the Jurassic Period sometime between 180 and 140 million years ago in various environments, including tidal mudflats, beaches, and sand dunes. The Middle Jurassic San Rafael Group was dominantly deposited as ergs (sand seas) in a desert environment around the shallow Sundance Sea.

==Description==
At its type section at Entrada Point, located in the northern part the San Rafael Swell in Emery County, Utah, the Entrada consists of red silty sandstone and lesser interbedded mudstone and is a slope-forming formation. This part of the Entrada is sometimes described as the &quot;earthy facies&quot;. Here the Entrada is overlain by the Curtis Formation, and overlies the Carmel Formation. To the south and east, the Entrada transitions to cliff-forming red or white crossbedded sandstone, sometimes called the &quot;slickrock facies&quot;. This is actually more typical of the Entrada as a whole, and a principal reference section including both facies was designated by Peterson in 1988 at Pine Creek, north of Escalante, Utah, in the Kaiparowits Basin.

At the reference section in the Kaiparowitz Basin, the Entrada is thick and is divided into three informal members. The lower member is of orange-red silty sandstone, with occasional beds of red mudstone, corresponding to the earthy facies. The middle member is of red to green mudstone interbedded with red to white sandstone. The upper member is of crossbedded white sandstone. The white color is attributed to bleaching by organic-rich fluids from overlying beds. The formation rests on the Carmel Formation and is overlain by the Morrison Formation. 

In the Curtis Mountains region of northeastern Arizona, the Entrada is overlain by the Wanakah Formation.

In the San Juan Basin of northwestern New Mexico, the Entrada consists of upper and lower sandy members and a medial silty member, the Rehoboth Member. The Curtis Formation is sometimes absent and the Entrada then overlies Chinle Formation. It is overlain by the Todilto Formation. Southeast of Fort Defiance, Arizona, the lower sandy beds are assigned to the Iyanbito Member. Total thickness is up to .

In the Slick Rock, Colorado area, the Entrada is divided into a &quot;middle sandstone&quot;, the Rehoboth Member, and the Slick Rock Member, in ascending order.

The Entrada has been dated to the early to middle Callovian stage of the latest Middle Jurassic.

==History of investigation==
The Entrada Sandstone was named as one of the four formations of the San Rafael Group by James Gilluly and Reeside in 1928. Gregory and Moore worked out the geographic extent of the formation and gave an overview of it in 1931. The extent was revised several times afterwards (most recently in 1992 by Condon). It was divided into the Gunsight Butte, Cannonville, and Escalante members by Thompson and Stokes in 1970. The principal reference for the formation was written in 1988 by Peterson.

==Members==
Entrada members are (in alphabetical order):
*Cannonville Member (UT)
*Cow Springs Member (AZ); equivalent to the upper member at the reference section in southern Utah
*Dewey Bridge Member (CO, UT) - named after the type locality at Dewey Bridge. This brick-red layer has a blocky look to it. Now assigned to the Carmel Formation.
*Escalante Member (UT)
*Henrieville Member (UT); abandoned by Peterson in 1988.
*Exeter Member (NM)
*Gunsight Butte Member (UT)
*Iyanbito Member (NM)
*Moab Member (CO, UT) or Moab Tongue (CO, UT) - named after the type locality of Moab, Utah. The whitish sands from inland dunes make up this &quot;cap rock&quot; layer, as seen atop Delicate Arch and Broken Arch in Arches National Park.
*Red Mesa Member (AZ, NM, UT)
*Slick Rock Member (CO, UT) - named for the type locality at Slick Rock, Colorado; rounded beach sands were cemented together to create this uniform layer.

<doc id="260811" wikidata="Q428764" url="?curid=260811" title="ZSNES">
<text>ZSNES is a free software Super Nintendo Entertainment System emulator written mostly in x86 assembly with official ports for Linux, DOS, Windows, and unofficial ports for Xbox and macOS.

== Background ==
Development of ZSNES began on 3 July 1997 and the first version was released on 14 October 1997, for DOS. Since then, official ports have been made for Windows and Linux. The emulator became free software under the GPL-2.0-or-later license on 2 April 2001. Despite an announcement by &quot;adventure_of_link&quot; in 2009 stating that &quot;ZSNES is NOT dead, it&#x27;s still in development&quot;, made on the ZSNES board after the departure of its original developers &quot;zsKnight&quot; and &quot;_Demo_&quot;, development has slowed dramatically since its last version (1.51 released on 24 January 2007). Much of the development efforts concentrated on increasing the emulator&#x27;s portability, by rewriting assembly code in C and C++, including a new GUI using Qt.

ZSNES is notable in that it was early in being able to emulate several of the SNES enhancement chips at some level. Until version 1.50, ZSNES featured netplay via TCP/IP or UDP.

An early ZSNES feature of interest was &quot;ZMV movies&quot;. This feature enabled players to record their play session inputs and then output those to a ZMV file, in such a way that another user with a copy of ZSNES, a matching ROM file, and the ZMV file, should be able to &quot;watch&quot; the other person&#x27;s gameplay. This long preceded mass availability of gameplay videos online, being an early form of sharing this type of content.

Because ZSNES is largely written in low-level assembly language for x86 processors, the idea of porting ZSNES to devices using RISC architectures such as ARM is highly unfeasible. Commercial gaming consoles did not typically use x86 processors (with the original Xbox being the most well-known exception) prior to the eighth generation, with the 2013 releases of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

== Development history ==
The first public release of ZSNES was version 0.150, on October 14, 1997. It incorporated the entire 65816 instruction set from the SNES&#x27;s modified WDC 65C816 microprocessor, as well as SRAM support and partial Mode 7 implementation. It also already offered save states to a .ZST file as an additional feature. This initial version missed certain DSP features.

Version 0.600 from September 9, 1998, was the first to feature developer Pharos (as a coding assistant), and was a milestone release due to the implementation a of new 16-bit graphics engine, as well as featuring an entirely new GUI with more functions available than before. Shortly afterwards, version 0.700 from October 27, 1998, was the first to compile with C code.

Starting from version 0.900c/a from July 4, 1999, an important feature for the time was added, which was native ZIP compression support, which allowed users to save space in the then expensive hard disks. Also, work intensified on improving support of the SA-1 chip.

Version 1.000 from September 1, 2000, marks ZSNES&#x27;s first official Windows release, and the next several versions of the emulator focused on improving the quality of this port. In April 2, 2001, the software&#x27;s source code was released and the team was joined by coder Teuf.

Release 1.30b from June 16, 2001, can be considered a landmark in Super Nintendo emulation, as it added initial support to Star Ocean and its S-DD1 compression chip. This title pushed the limits of the system&#x27;s hardware, boasting voice clips and enhanced graphics, and was tricky to even get running on an emulator.

After zsKnight&#x27;s departure for personal reasons in July 2001, the project made a release in homage to him and his family, version 1.337, from September 30, 2001. The emulator continued being updated until releases halted in July of 2002, and it would be more than two years until a new public release.

When version 1.40 eventually released on December 25, 2004, it marked a turning point for the project, with new contributors and significant overhauls to the emulator&#x27;s ageing systems. Developers Nach and pagefault particularly focused on removing several of the infamous hacks that were part of ZSNES&#x27;s code base, implementing proper code that tricky games relied on. In tandem with that, extensive work was carried out to better support special chips.

Version v1.50 from December 22, 2006, was another major overhaul, which according to the developers: &quot;ZSNES is a program with over 200,000 lines of source code, and in this release, over 25% of that has been modified; also, around 15% of the assembly has been ported to C.&quot; This was the final major release of the emulator, being followed by the minor 1.51, and winding down thereafter.

== Reception ==
ZSNES was generally well-regarded in its heyday, with British game magazine &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; in 2005 calling the emulator &quot;very impressive&quot; and praising the &quot;incredible toaster mode&quot;.

However, with the more recent development of more accurate SNES emulators such as Snes9x and higan as computers have gradually become more powerful, retrospective reviews have criticized ZSNES not only for its relatively low accuracy, but also because its former popularity has led several fan-made translations and modifications to be designed with specific workarounds for the emulator&#x27;s inaccuracies, which often makes them unplayable both on real hardware and in the newer emulators that have superseded ZSNES. Some of these other emulators even include a mode which is explicitly designed to replicate the quirks of ZSNES, allowing the ZSNES-focused mods to become playable again.

In 2015 an exploit that allowed a specially crafted SNES ROM to gain control of the host system, and thus be able to execute malicious code, was discovered in version 1.51; a partially fixed preview build was released shortly afterwards.

<text>Amy is an English feminine given name, the English version of the French Aimée, which means &quot;beloved&quot;. It was used as a diminutive of the Latin name Amata, a name derived from the passive participle of &quot;amare,&quot; “to love”. The name has been in use in the Anglosphere since the Middle Ages. It was among the 50 most popular names for girls in England between 1538 and 1700. It was popularized in the 19th century in the Anglosphere by a character in Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s 1821 novel &quot;Kenilworth&quot;, which was based on the story of Amy Robsart. Enslaved Black women in the United States prior to the American Civil War were more likely to bear the name than white American women because slave masters often chose their names from literary sources. The name declined in use after 1880 but was revived due to the hit song &quot;Once in Love with Amy&quot; from the 1948 Broadway musical &quot;Where&#x27;s Charley?&quot;. The name peaked in usage in the United States between 1973 and 1976, when it was among the five most popular names for American girls. It remained among the top 250 names for American girls in the early 2020s.

<text>The first USS &quot;Columbia&quot; of the United States Navy to be commissioned was a three-masted, wooden-hulled sailing frigate, built at the Washington Navy Yard and carrying 54 guns (an earlier &quot;Columbia&quot; was destroyed during the burning of Washington in 1814 whilst it was still under construction). Her keel was laid in 1825, but as was typical of much Navy construction during this period, she was not launched until much later, on 9 March 1836.

On her first cruise, from May 1838 – June 1840 with Lieutenant George A. Magruder in command, &quot;Columbia&quot; rounded the Cape of Good Hope to become flagship of Commodore George C. Read in the East India Squadron. She returned to the United States by way of Cape Horn, becoming one of the first U.S. naval ships to circumnavigate the globe. She participated in the 1838 Second Sumatran Expedition in response to a Maylay attack on an American merchant vessel.

The &quot;Columbia&quot; served as flagship of the Home Squadron from January–May 1842; cruised on Brazil Squadron from July 1842 – February 1844 and in the Mediterranean Squadron from May–December 1844. She returned to the Brazil Squadron as flagship from November 1845 – October 1847, and was placed in ordinary at Norfolk Navy Yard upon her return home. Except for a cruise as flagship of the Home Squadron from January 1853 – March 1855, she remained at Norfolk until the outbreak of the American Civil War.

During her 1854-1855 cruise as flagship of the Home Squadron, the USS &quot;Columbia&quot; crew suffered repeated outbreaks of disease such as Smallpox, Cholera and Yellow Fever, see thumbnail image of 27 March 1855 petition from the frigate crew to Secretary of the Navy James C. Dobbin. Their petition complained of mounting mortally and illness,and requested their discharge. A separate report (exert below) of 19 March 1855, from Home Squadron Commander, Commodore John Thomas Newton to the Secretary Dobbin explained his decision to return to Norfolk Virginia and to seek medical care at the Naval Hospital for his crew. 

:&quot;our recent trip to the unhealthy climate of San Juan and our :subsequent long cruise added to the debility produced by two summers :in the tropics, [illegible] our men for the reception of fever, and it :is not at all strange that the sickness should have made its :appearance on board - It is remarkable, however, up to our recent loss of seven men but three deaths have occurred on board the &quot;Columbia&quot; :since she has been in commission now over two years – There are at :present 50 sick men on board, many of whom will be immediately removed :to the Hospital ...&quot;

The Navy Department previous experience in 1822 with an outbreak of Yellow Fever aboard the frigate USS Macedonian (1810) that killed 74 of the frigates officers and crew, revealed how quickly they devastated morale and operational efficiency. Secretary Dobbin notated his approval of Newton&#x27;s request and had the sick crew men moved to the naval hospital Naval Medical Center Portsmouth. 

 &quot;Columbia&quot; was scuttled and burned by Union forces to avoid her capture by Confederates upon the surrender of Norfolk Navy Yard on 21 April 1861. Following the close of the war she was raised and sold at Norfolk on 10 October 1867.

<text>Bathin (also &quot;Bathym&quot;, &quot;Mathim&quot;, or &quot;Marthim&quot;) is a demon described in demonological grimoires.

== Variations ==
He is ranked as a duke in the &quot;Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; (as the eighteenth spirit) and Johann Weyer&#x27;s &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot; (as the tenth spirit), where he is described as a serpent-tailed and muscular man riding a pale horse, who knows the properties of plants and stones, transports people across countries, and rules 30 legions of demons. He also appears in the Livre des Esperitz, as &quot;Machin,&quot; without the horse but ruling 37 legions of demons. The German edition of &quot;The Grimoire of Pope Honorius&quot; describes Bathin (again by the name Machin) as teaching about and providing foreign plants and rocks. In the &quot;Grand Grimoire&quot;, he (as Bathsin or Bathim) is listed as a subordinate of Fleurety. According to Rudd, Bathin is opposed by the Shemhamphorasch angel Caliel.

<text>Toy guns are toys which imitate real guns, but are designed for recreational sport or casual play by children. From hand-carved wooden replicas to factory-produced pop guns and cap guns, toy guns come in all sizes, prices and materials such as wood, metal, plastic or any combination thereof. Many newer toy guns are brightly colored and oddly shaped to prevent them from being mistaken for real firearms.

==Types==
===Wooden guns===
Wooden guns are made to resemble real guns. Often handmade, these toys may or may not have metal parts and are made with various levels of detail.

===Suction cup darts===

Suction cup dart toy pistols are made to resemble real pistols, used to fire one suction cup dart.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebay/325389227174&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ebay/384702596897&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rubber band guns===

Rubber band guns are toy guns used to fire one or more rubber bands (or &quot;elastic bands&quot;). Rubber band guns are often used in live-action games such as Assassins, in which they are common and popular toy weapons. They are also common in offices and classrooms. Rubber band guns have been popular toys that date back to the invention of rubber bands, which were patented in England on March 17, 1845, by Stephen Perry.

===Cap guns===
Cap guns, cap pistols, or cap rifles are toy guns that create a loud sound simulating a gunshot and a puff of smoke when a small percussion cap is exploded. Cap guns were originally made of cast iron, but after World War II were made of zinc alloy, and most newer models are made of plastic.

===Model guns===

Model guns are Japanese full-size toy guns that highly replicate the appearance, design, and operation of the real ones but cannot shoot any projectile. It comes as either ignition models (a very sophisticated type of cap guns) or non-ignition dummy models. Both are subject to the strict Japanese Gun Control Law for identification and to prevent possible modification.

===Theatrical prop guns===

Prop guns are toy guns that have to look like real guns. They are commonly used in movies, TV shows, and other theatrical performances.

===Spud guns===
Spud guns are small toy guns used to fire a fragment of potato. To operate, one punctures the surface of a potato with the gun&#x27;s hollow tip and pries out a small pellet which fits snugly in the muzzle. Squeezing the trigger causes a small build-up of air pressure inside the toy which propels the projectile. The devices are usually short-range and low-powered.

===Water guns===
Water guns are a type of toy gun that uses a variety of methods to spray jets of water. Many early small water guns used the same trigger based pumping mechanism used for spray bottles. In this type of device, the trigger actuates a positive displacement pump shaft. With the aid of two check valves, often using small balls, fluid is drawn into the pump from a reservoir, then forced out the nozzle upon squeezing the trigger.

The simplicity of the spraying mechanism allowed these toys to be manufactured cheaply and allowed the majority of the body to be used as the reservoir. The primary limitation of this design is the volume of water that can be effectively moved per pump. Increasing pump volume would require more user effort to push the fluid out, making larger designs impractical. However, this technology remains widely used today both in spray bottles as well as small water guns that can be found in a wide variety of shapes and colors.

===Pop guns===
The pop gun is a toy gun that was made by American inventor Edward Lewis and uses air pressure to fire a small tethered or untethered projectile (such as cork or foam) out of a barrel, most often via piston action though sometimes via spring pressure. Other variants do not launch the obstruction, but simply create a loud noise. This mechanism consists of a hollow cylindrical barrel which is sealed at one end with the projectile and at the other with a long-handled plunger. In this type, the plunger is rapidly forced down the barrel, building up internal air pressure until the projectile is forced out with the &quot;pop&quot; sound that lends the toy its name.

===Ray guns===
In fiction, ray guns are a science fiction particle-beam weapon that fires what is usually destructive energy. In most stories, when activated, a raygun emits a ray, typically visible, usually lethal if it hits a human target, often destructive if it hits mechanical objects, with properties and other effects unspecified or varying.

Toy ray guns often have a mechanical component that sparks, light-up and make a sound effect.

===Tracer guns===

Tracer guns, sometimes known as disc guns, are a kind of toy gun made of durable plastic. The toy shoots lightweight plastic discs roughly the size of a penny. The discs used as ammunition for these guns are often sold with the label &quot;Jet Discs.&quot; The firing mechanism is a spring. The magazine typically holds around 20 &quot;discs.&quot; The range is about 10 feet, and accuracy is far from dependable. The trigger requires some force. The firing sound is loud, low, and distinctive. Oftentimes the trigger will become loose and will take multiple attempts to shoot.

===Foam dart blasters===
Foam dart blasters are toy guns that fire foam darts, discs, or foam balls. The term &quot;Nerf blaster&quot;, referring to blasters made by Hasbro, is often used as a blanket term for any foam dart blaster, regardless of whether or not it has the Nerf brand name. Foam dart blasters are manufactured in multiple forms, including pistols, rifles, and light machine guns.

The first Nerf blasters emerged in the late 1980s with the release of the Nerf Blast-a-Ball and the Arrowstorm.

===Airsoft guns===
Airsoft guns are replica toy guns used in airsoft sports. They are essentially a special type of very low-power smoothbore air guns designed to shoot non-metallic spherical projectiles often colloquially (and incorrectly) referred to as &quot;BBs&quot;, which are typically made of (but not limited to) plastic or biodegradable resin materials. Airsoft gun powerplants are designed to have low muzzle energy ratings (generally less than ) and the polymer pellets have significantly less penetrative and stopping powers than conventional air guns, and are generally quite safe for competitive sporting and recreational purposes if proper protective gear is worn. 

MilSim is a major element of appeal for airsoft guns, and airsoft games rely heavily on an honor system, where a player has the ethical obligation to call himself out of play when hit.

===Gel blasters===

Gel blasters are replica toy guns similar in design to airsoft guns but much less powerful, and shoot superabsorbent polymer (most commonly sodium polyacrylate) water beads (often sold commercially as garden moisture retainers) which are hydrated into -diameter projectiles colloquially called &quot;gel beads&quot; or &quot;gel balls&quot;.

Gel blasters are invented as a replacement toy for regions with airsoft-unfriendly laws (e.g. China, Australia, Malaysia and Vietnam), and are often played in CQB-style shooting skirmishes similar to paintball, but follows an airsoft-like honor-based gameplay umpiring system.

===Paintball gun===
Paintball gun, paint gun, or marker gun, is the main piece of paintball equipment in the sport of paintball. Markers use an expanding gas, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) or compressed air, to propel paintballs through the barrel and quickly strike a target. The term &quot;marker&quot; is derived from its original use as a means for forestry personnel to mark trees and ranchers to mark wandering cattle.

===Light guns===
Light guns are pointing devices for computers and a control device for arcade and video games, typically shaped to resemble a pistol. Modern screen-based light guns work by building an optical sensor into the gun, which receives its input from the light emitted by on-screen target(s). The first device of this type, the light pen, was used on the MIT Whirlwind computer. Modern starting pistols in athletics use similar devices that emit a sound and flash a light.

===Laser tag gun===
Laser tag gun is a tag game played with toy guns which fire infrared beams. Infrared-sensitive targets are commonly worn by each player and are sometimes integrated within the arena in which the game is played.

Since its birth in 1979, with the release of the Star Trek Electronic Phasers toy manufactured by the South Bend Electronics brand of Milton Bradley, laser tag has evolved into both indoor and outdoor styles of play, and may include simulations of combat, role play-style games, or competitive sporting events including tactical configurations and precise game goals.

Laser tag is popular with a wide range of ages. When compared to paintball, laser tag is painless because it uses no physical projectiles, and indoor versions may be considered less physically demanding because most indoor venues prohibit running or roughhousing.

===Dummy guns===
Dummy guns have been historically used by police and military organizations for training purposes. During World War II, Parris Manufacturing Company provided over 2 million accurate copies of the M1903 Springfield rifles, the MK 1 USN Dummy Training Rifle to the U.S. armed forces. After the war they continued to manufacture and sell their replicas as toy guns. As well as smaller sized models for children that featured a working bolt with a dummy bullet, leather sling, the clicker action, and a smaller rubber bayonet similar to the M1 bayonet.

Today, the United States military, calls these dummy training guns &quot;rubber ducks&quot; or &quot;blue guns&quot;, usually resembling an M16 type rifle. Trainees are issued rubber ducks before they have been properly trained to use actual rifles, in order to become familiar with the care, responsible handling, and added weight of an M16 during various activities, such as bayonet drills, water survival, and marches. They are also used to train soldiers in various ceremonial practices that differ when soldiers are armed. For example, standing at attention requires a different stance and set of movements when the soldier has a rifle in-hand.

==Popularity and proliferation==

Children have always had small imitations of things from the adult world and toy guns are no exception. From a hand-carved wooden replica to factory-produced pop guns and cap guns, toy guns came in all sizes, prices and materials from wood, to metal, to plastic or any combination thereof.

With the influence of Hollywood and comic strips, tie-ins could make an ordinary toy gun a major bestseller. In the 1930s Daisy Outdoor Products came out with a Buck Rogers Rocket Pistol (1933), Disintegrator Pistol (1934), and Liquid Helium Pistol (1935) that sold in record numbers.
Mattel had used television advertising to sell their &quot;burp gun&quot; on &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; in the mid-1950s to great effect. In 1959 Mattel sponsored their own television show Matty&#x27;s Funday Funnies with their trademark little boy &quot;Matty&quot; showing cartoons and advertising their products. Mattel toys came out with Dick Tracy weapons in 1960 that were state of the art. Not only could the &quot;Dick Tracy Crimestoppers&quot; have a realistic snubnosed revolver in a shoulder holster, but Mattel also boosted junior law enforcement firepower with a Dick Tracy cap firing tommy gun that fired a burst of 6 caps &quot;automatically&quot; when the M-1 Thompson-style bolt was pulled back. One commercial featured Billy Mumy demonstrating the weapons to his father prior to watching &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; on TV. Mattel also came up with a &quot;Dick Tracy Water Jet Gun&quot; that was a miniature replica of a police pump action shotgun that fired caps when one pulled the trigger &quot;and&quot; squirted water when one pumped the slide. When the Dick Tracy craze faded the same two weapons were reissued in military camouflage as Green Beret &quot;Guerrilla Fighter&quot; weapons. (see United States Army Special Forces in popular culture). Mattel later issued the same tommy gun in its original colours as a &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; tie-in complete with ape mask.
In the mid-1960s, Multiple Toymakers/Multiple Plastics Corporation (MPC) came out with James Bond&#x27;s attaché case from &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;. Topper Toys replied with a copy called &quot;Secret Sam&quot; that featured a toy gun that fired plastic bullets &quot;through&quot; the attaché case and had a working camera that outsold 007&#x27;s kit. MPC toys replied with a &quot;B.A.R.K&quot; - &quot;Bond Assault and Raider Kit&quot; an attaché case that opened up to display a firing mortar and a rocket shooting pistol. MPC also provided a &quot;Bond-O-Matic&quot; water pistol. Bond&#x27;s television competition The Man From U.N.C.L.E. had their pistol with attachments that turned it into a rifle made by both the Ideal Toy Company in the US and the Lone Star Toys company in the United Kingdom. Mattel came out with a series of &quot;Zero-M&quot; secret-agent weapons such as a camera turning into a pistol and a radio turning into a rifle demonstrated by a juvenile Agent Zero M played by Kurt Russell.

Perhaps the ultimate toy weapon was the 1964 Topper Toys Johnny Seven OMA (One Man Army) where an exciting television commercial showed one little boy using each of the seven weapons of the gun to wipe out a neighborhood full of children armed only with &quot;ordinary&quot; toy guns. Though an amazing seller, the &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; television program refused to air the advertisement. The proliferation of toy weapons was satirized in the &quot;Our Man in Toyland&quot; episode of &quot;Get Smart&quot;.

In the 1970s, the &quot;Star Wars&quot; media franchise provided new laser blaster and lightsabers produced by Kenner Toys.

==Toy gun control==
Toy guns can cause harm like many objects not under proper supervision. Unlike most other toys though, much of the danger of these toys is related to mistaking a toy gun for a real gun or vice versa. For example:

*a robber or other criminals might threaten people with a toy gun.
*people might call the police, flee, panic, or attempt to overpower someone carrying a toy gun.
*police officers and armed citizens might mistake someone carrying a toy gun for a killer carrying a real gun, and shoot them.
*a child might play with and fire a real gun confusing it for a toy gun.

===United States===
Toy guns were temporarily removed from the Sears Roebuck 1968 Christmas catalog after the April assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the June assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. However, they returned to the Sears catalog the following year.
Beginning in the 1970s, American gun control advocates called for federal government to regulate and/or ban the manufacture and sale of toy guns. These calls were countered by toy industry groups, who preferred to set their own standards. In 1973, the newly formed U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission received petitions and letters from consumers, asking the commission to institute mandatory safety standards for the design of toy weapons. These calls for action were repeated in 1975. However, the trade association representing the toy weapon manufacturers also contacted the CPSC, asking them to delay until the industry developed their own set of voluntary standards. The voluntary guidelines that were published over the next few years emphasized the use of warning labels on packaging and instructions, rather than mandating safety standards for the design of projectile toys. The Consumer Product Safety Commission rejected further petitions to regulate toy weapon manufacture in 1981 and 1985. In 1992, the Department of Commerce prohibited the manufacture, sale, or shipping of toy guns unless they have an orange tip or are entirely brightly colored. The regulation does not prohibit end-users from modifying the toys.

In March 2018, Walmart (the largest single retailer in the United States) announced that they would stop selling certain types of toy guns. “We are also removing items from our website resembling assault-style rifles, including nonlethal airsoft guns and toys,” the company said in a statement.

====Laws====
In the United States, federal law and regulations indicate that all toy guns transported or imported into the country must have a 6mm-wide blaze orange tip or a blaze orange stripe 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) thick on both sides of the barrel. However, this is not required by federal law for airsoft and paintball. Part 272 of Title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations on foreign commerce and trade (15 CFR 272) states that &quot;no person shall manufacture, enter into commerce, ship, transport, or receive any toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm&quot; without approved markings; these may include an orange tip, orange barrel plug, brightly colored (safety orange) exterior of the whole toy, or transparent construction.

New York City, Washington, D.C., Chicago, and parts of Michigan have completely banned airsoft guns.. In New York City, as of 2003, the sale of replica toy guns was punishable with one year&#x27;s jail term plus $1,000. Chicago goes even further with their mandates. It is considered a crime to wield a look-alike or replica gun (e.g., toy gun, airsoft gun) in public. If a toy gun or replica gun is used to commit a crime in Chicago, then that person is treated as though they had actually used a real firearm. However, state laws relating to the regulation of toy, look-alike, or imitation firearms, or purporting to ban the sale or manufacture of bb guns, paintball guns, or airsoft guns are preempted by federal law.

===United Kingdom=== 
There is a controversy as to whether or not toy guns are appropriate for children to play with. Some people believe they can encourage violence. In 2007, the British Department for Children, Schools and Families (which existed between 2007 and 2010) has advised young boys be encouraged to play with toy guns, as it will encourage them to learn and foster their development. However, the National Union of Teachers in England has criticised this advice, arguing that toy guns &quot;symbolise aggression&quot; and that encouraging boys to play with them fosters gender stereotypes.

===Pakistan===
In 2016, Shafeeq Gigyani, who is a peace activist in Pakistan, started a campaign against toy guns.

<text>Beal is a village in Northumberland, in England. It is situated a short distance inland from the North Sea coast, and lies on the link road between the A1 and Lindisfarne. The East Coast Main Line runs to the west of the village but the station was closed in the 1960s. The station site has been landscaped and includes a Peckett 0-4-0ST steam locomotive and an ex-North Eastern Railway cast metal warning sign.
== History ==

The place-name &quot;Beal&quot; derives from the Old English &#x27;beo-hyll&#x27;, which means &#x27;bee hill&#x27;.

== Governance ==
Beal is in the parliamentary constituency of Berwick-upon-Tweed.

== Economy ==

The area is largely agricultural in outlook.

There is a pub at Beal situated on the main road called The Lindisfarne Inn. It re-opened after being refurbished and was renamed having previously been named The Plough.

The Barn at Beal is a visitor centre with various wild birds and looks at the link between farming and the local environment.

There is a small caravan site located at Brock Mill farmhouse and there are a number of bed-and-breakfast outlets.

== Transport ==

The following bus services operate to Beal (October 2011) - the A1 minibus link from Newcastle operated by Holy Island minibuses and 477 from Berwick upon Tweed by Perrymans Buses.

The South East Northumberland Rail Users Group would like to see the station re-opened for local and tourist (for Lindisfarne) traffic.

<doc id="260836" wikidata="Q279082" url="?curid=260836" title="Twistor theory">
<text>In theoretical physics, twistor theory was proposed by Roger Penrose in 1967 as a possible path to quantum gravity and has evolved into a widely studied branch of theoretical and mathematical physics. Penrose&#x27;s idea was that twistor space should be the basic arena for physics from which space-time itself should emerge. It has led to powerful mathematical tools that have applications to differential and integral geometry, nonlinear differential equations and representation theory, and in physics to general relativity, quantum field theory, and the theory of scattering amplitudes.

Twistor theory arose in the context of the rapidly expanding mathematical developments in Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity in the late 1950s and in the 1960s and carries a number of influences from that period. In particular, Roger Penrose has credited Ivor Robinson as an important early influence in the development of twistor theory, through his construction of so-called &quot;Robinson congruences&quot;.

==Overview==
Projective twistor space formula_1 is projective 3-space formula_2, the simplest 3-dimensional compact algebraic variety. It has a physical interpretation as the space of massless particles with spin. It is the projectivisation of a 4-dimensional complex vector space, non-projective twistor space formula_3, with a Hermitian form of signature (2, 2) and a holomorphic volume form. This can be most naturally understood as the space of chiral (Weyl) spinors for the conformal group formula_4 of Minkowski space; it is the fundamental representation of the spin group formula_5 of the conformal group. This definition can be extended to arbitrary dimensions except that beyond dimension four, one defines projective twistor space to be the space of projective pure spinors for the conformal group.

In its original form, twistor theory encodes physical fields on Minkowski space in terms of complex analytic objects on twistor space via the Penrose transform. This is especially natural for massless fields of arbitrary spin. In the first instance these are obtained via contour integral formulae in terms of free holomorphic functions on regions in twistor space. The holomorphic twistor functions that give rise to solutions to the massless field equations can be more deeply understood as Čech representatives of analytic cohomology classes on regions in formula_1. These correspondences have been extended to certain nonlinear fields, including self-dual gravity in Penrose&#x27;s nonlinear graviton construction and self-dual Yang–Mills fields in the so-called Ward construction; the former gives rise to deformations of the underlying complex structure of regions in formula_1, and the latter to certain holomorphic vector bundles over regions in formula_1. These constructions have had wide applications, including inter alia the theory of integrable systems.

The self-duality condition is a major limitation for incorporating the full nonlinearities of physical theories, although it does suffice for Yang–Mills–Higgs monopoles and instantons (see ADHM construction). An early attempt to overcome this restriction was the introduction of ambitwistors by Isenberg, Yasskin and Green, and their superspace extension, super-ambitwistors, by Edward Witten. Ambitwistor space is the space of complexified light rays or massless particles and can be regarded as a complexification or cotangent bundle of the original twistor description. By extending the ambitwistor correspondence to suitably defined formal neighborhoods, Isenberg, Yasskin and Green showed the equivalence between the vanishing of the curvature along such extended null lines and the full Yang–Mills field equations. Witten showed that a further extension, within the framework of super Yang–Mills theory, including fermionic and scalar fields, gave rise, in the case of &quot;N&quot; = 1 or 2 supersymmetry, to the constraint equations, while for &quot;N&quot; = 3 (or 4), the vanishing condition for supercurvature along super null lines (super ambitwistors) implied the full set of field equations, including those for the fermionic fields. This was subsequently shown to give a equivalence between the null curvature constraint equations and the supersymmetric Yang-Mills field equations. Through dimensional reduction, it may also be deduced from the analogous super-ambitwistor correspondence for 10-dimensional, &quot;N&quot; = 1 super-Yang–Mills theory.

Twistorial formulae for interactions beyond the self-dual sector also arose in Witten&#x27;s twistor string theory, which is a quantum theory of holomorphic maps of a Riemann surface into twistor space. This gave rise to the remarkably compact RSV (Roiban, Spradlin and Volovich) formulae for tree-level S-matrices of Yang–Mills theories, but its gravity degrees of freedom gave rise to a version of conformal supergravity limiting its applicability; conformal gravity is an unphysical theory containing ghosts, but its interactions are combined with those of Yang–Mills theory in loop amplitudes calculated via twistor string theory.

Despite its shortcomings, twistor string theory led to rapid developments in the study of scattering amplitudes. One was the so-called MHV formalism loosely based on disconnected strings, but was given a more basic foundation in terms of a twistor action for full Yang–Mills theory in twistor space. Another key development was the introduction of BCFW recursion. This has a natural formulation in twistor space that in turn led to remarkable formulations of scattering amplitudes in terms of Grassmann integral formulae and polytopes. These ideas have evolved more recently into the positive Grassmannian and amplituhedron.

Twistor string theory was extended first by generalising the RSV Yang–Mills amplitude formula, and then by finding the underlying string theory. The extension to gravity was given by Cachazo &amp; Skinner, and formulated as a twistor string theory for maximal supergravity by David Skinner. Analogous formulae were then found in all dimensions by Cachazo, He and Yuan for Yang–Mills theory and gravity and subsequently for a variety of other theories. They were then understood as string theories in ambitwistor space by Mason and Skinner in a general framework that includes the original twistor string and extends to give a number of new models and formulae. As string theories they have the same critical dimensions as conventional string theory; for example the type II supersymmetric versions are critical in ten dimensions and are equivalent to the full field theory of type II supergravities in ten dimensions (this is distinct from conventional string theories that also have a further infinite hierarchy of massive higher spin states that provide an ultraviolet completion). They extend to give formulae for loop amplitudes and can be defined on curved backgrounds.

==The twistor correspondence==
Denote Minkowski space by formula_9, with coordinates formula_10 and Lorentzian metric formula_11 signature formula_12. Introduce 2-component spinor indices formula_13 and set

:formula_14

Non-projective twistor space formula_3 is a four-dimensional complex vector space with coordinates denoted by formula_16 where formula_17 and formula_18 are two constant Weyl spinors. The hermitian form can be expressed by defining a complex conjugation from formula_3 to its dual formula_20 by formula_21 so that the Hermitian form can be expressed as

:formula_22

This together with the holomorphic volume form, formula_23 is invariant under the group SU(2,2), a quadruple cover of the conformal group C(1,3) of compactified Minkowski spacetime.

Points in Minkowski space are related to subspaces of twistor space through the incidence relation

:formula_24

The incidence relation is preserved under an overall re-scaling of the twistor, so usually one works in projective twistor space formula_25 which is isomorphic as a complex manifold to formula_2. A point formula_27 thereby determines a line formula_28 in formula_1 parametrised by formula_30 A twistor formula_31 is easiest understood in space-time for complex values of the coordinates where it defines a totally null two-plane that is self-dual. Take formula_32 to be real, then if formula_33 vanishes, then formula_32 lies on a light ray, whereas if formula_33 is non-vanishing, there are no solutions, and indeed then formula_36 corresponds to a massless particle with spin that are not localised in real space-time.

==Variations==
===Supertwistors===

Supertwistors are a supersymmetric extension of twistors introduced by Alan Ferber in 1978. Non-projective twistor space is extended by fermionic coordinates where formula_37 is the number of supersymmetries so that a twistor is now given by formula_38 with formula_39 anticommuting. The super conformal group formula_40 naturally acts on this space and a supersymmetric version of the Penrose transform takes cohomology classes on supertwistor space to massless supersymmetric multiplets on super Minkowski space. The formula_41 case provides the target for Penrose&#x27;s original twistor string and the formula_42 case is that for Skinner&#x27;s supergravity generalisation.

=== Higher dimensional generalization of the Klein correspondence ===

A higher dimensional generalization of the Klein correspondence underlying twistor theory, applicable to isotropic subspaces of conformally compactified (complexified) Minkowski space and its super-space extensions, was developed by J. Harnad and S. Shnider.

=== Hyperkähler manifolds ===
Hyperkähler manifolds of dimension formula_43 also admit a twistor correspondence with a twistor space of complex dimension formula_44.

===Palatial twistor theory===
The nonlinear graviton construction encodes only anti-self-dual, i.e., left-handed fields. A first step towards the problem of modifying twistor space so as to encode a general gravitational field is the encoding of right-handed fields. Infinitesimally, these are encoded in twistor functions or cohomology classes of homogeneity −6. The task of using such twistor functions in a fully nonlinear way so as to obtain a &quot;right-handed&quot; nonlinear graviton has been referred to as the (gravitational) googly problem. (The word &quot;googly&quot; is a term used in the game of cricket for a ball bowled with right-handed helicity using the apparent action that would normally give rise to left-handed helicity.) The most recent proposal in this direction by Penrose in 2015 was based on noncommutative geometry on twistor space and referred to as palatial twistor theory. The theory is named after Buckingham Palace, where Michael Atiyah suggested to Penrose the use of a type of &quot;noncommutative algebra&quot;, an important component of the theory. (The underlying twistor structure in palatial twistor theory was modeled not on the twistor space but on the non-commutative holomorphic twistor quantum algebra.)

<text>The Mana series, known in Japan as , is an action role-playing game series created by Koichi Ishii, with development formerly from Square, and is currently owned by Square Enix. The series began in 1991 as &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot;, a Game Boy handheld side story to Square&#x27;s flagship franchise &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;. The &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; elements were subsequently dropped starting with the second installment, &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;, in order to become its own series. It has grown to include games of various genres within the fictional world of Mana, with recurring stories involving a world tree, its associated holy sword, and the fight against forces that would steal their power. Several character designs, creatures, and musical themes reappear frequently.

Four games were released in the series between 1991 and 1999: the original &quot;Seiken Densetsu&quot; (1991)—&quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; in North America and &quot;Mystic Quest&quot; in Europe—for the Game Boy, &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; (1993) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, &quot;Trials of Mana&quot; (1995) for the Super Famicom, and &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; for the PlayStation. A remake of the original game, &quot;Sword of Mana&quot; (2003), was published for the Game Boy Advance. All of the original games were action role-playing games, though they included a wide variety of gameplay mechanics, and the stories of the games were connected only thematically.

In 2006 and 2007, four more games were released as part of the &quot;World of Mana&quot; subseries, an attempt by Square Enix to release games in a series over a variety of genres and consoles. These were &quot;Children of Mana&quot; (2006), an action-oriented dungeon crawler game for the Nintendo DS; &quot;Friends of Mana&quot; (2006), a Japan-only multiplayer role-playing game for mobile phones; &quot;Dawn of Mana&quot; (2006), a 3D action-adventure game for the PlayStation 2; and &quot;Heroes of Mana&quot; (2007), a real-time strategy game for the DS. &quot;Children&quot; was developed by Nex Entertainment and &quot;Heroes&quot; by Brownie Brown, founded by several developers of &quot;Legend&quot;, though Ishii oversaw development of all four games. Three more games have been released since the &quot;World of Mana&quot; subseries ended: &quot;Circle of Mana&quot; (2013), a Japan-only card battle game for the GREE mobile platform, &quot;Rise of Mana&quot; (2014), a Japan-only free-to-play action role-playing game for iOS, Android, and PlayStation Vita, and &quot;Adventures of Mana&quot; (2016), a 3D remake of &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; for the PlayStation Vita, iOS, and Android. In addition to the games, four manga series and one novelization have been released in the &quot;Mana&quot; franchise.

In October 2024, a new mainline installment in the series, titled &quot;Visions of Mana&quot;, was announced.

The &quot;Mana&quot; series reception has been very uneven, with early games rated significantly higher by critics than more recent titles. &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; has been regarded as one of the best 2D action role-playing games ever made, and its music has inspired several orchestral concerts, while the games from the &quot;World of Mana&quot; series have been rated considerably lower. By 2021, the series had sold over 8 million copies.

== Development ==

=== History ===
Square trademarked &quot;Seiken Densetsu&quot; in 1989, intending to use it for a game project subtitled &quot;The Emergence of Excalibur&quot;, and led by Kazuhiko Aoki for the Famicom Disk System. According to early advertisements, the game would consist of an unprecedented five floppy disks, making it one of the largest titles developed for the Famicom up until that point. Although Square solicited pre-orders for the game, Kaoru Moriyama, a former Square employee, affirms that management canceled the ambitious project before it advanced beyond the early planning stages. In October 1987, customers who had placed orders were sent a letter informing them of the cancellation and had their purchases refunded. The letter also suggested to consider placing an order on another upcoming Square role-playing game in a similar vein: &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;.

In 1991, Square reused the &quot;Seiken Densetsu&quot; trademark for an unrelated Game Boy action role-playing game directed by Koichi Ishii. Originally developed under the title &quot;Gemma Knights&quot;, the game was renamed &quot;Seiken Densetsu: Final Fantasy Gaiden&quot; (published in North America as &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; and in Europe as &quot;Mystic Quest&quot;).

Beginning with the 1993 sequel, &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;, &quot;Seiken Densetsu&quot; was subsequently &quot;spun off&quot; into its own series of action role-playing games distinct from &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, named the &quot;Mana&quot; series outside Japan. Four titles in the series were released between 1993 and 2003. &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; was originally intended to be a launch title for the Super NES CD-ROM Adapter, but when the add-on was cancelled it was cut down into a standard Super NES cartridge, with many of the cut ideas appearing in other Square titles. Hirō Isono provided artwork for the game including forest landscapes. It was followed in 1995 by the then Japan-only &quot;Trials of Mana&quot; (Seiken Densetsu 3 in Japan); the game was originally planned to be released in English as &quot;Secret of Mana 2&quot;, but technical issues and localization costs prohibited the release. The final new game in the series&#x27; initial run is the 1999 &quot;Legend of Mana&quot;, developed for the PlayStation. &quot;Legend&quot; is a 2D game like its predecessors, despite the PlayStation&#x27;s 3D focus, because the console could not handle the full 3D world Ishii envisioned where one could interact with natural shaped objects. 2003 saw the release of &quot;Sword of Mana&quot;, a remake of the original &quot;Seiken Densetsu&quot; for the Game Boy Advance. The remake was outsourced to Brownie Brown, which was composed of many of the Square employees who had worked on &quot;Legend&quot;.

In 2003, Square, now Square Enix, began a drive to begin developing &quot;polymorphic content&quot;, a marketing and sales strategy to &quot;[provide] well-known properties on several platforms, allowing exposure of the products to as wide an audience as possible&quot;. The first of these was the &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot;, and Square Enix intended to have campaigns for other series whereby multiple games in different genres would be developed simultaneously. Although no such project for the &quot;Mana&quot; series had been announced by this point, it was announced in late 2004 that an unnamed &quot;Mana&quot; game was in development for the upcoming Nintendo DS platform. In early 2005, Square Enix announced a &quot;World of Mana&quot; project, the application of this &quot;polymorphic content&quot; idea to the &quot;Mana&quot; franchise, which would include several games across different genres and platforms. These games, as with the rest of the series, would not be direct sequels or prequels to one another, even if appearing so at first glance, but would instead share thematic connections. The first release in this project and the sixth release in the &quot;Mana&quot; series was announced in September 2005 as &quot;Children of Mana&quot; for the DS. Four games were released in 2006 and 2007 in the &quot;World of Mana&quot; subseries: &quot;Children of Mana&quot;, &quot;Friends of Mana&quot;, and &quot;Dawn of Mana&quot; in 2006, and &quot;Heroes of Mana&quot; in 2007.

Each game in the &quot;World of Mana&quot; series was different, both from each other and from the previous games in the series. &quot;Children&quot; is an action-oriented dungeon crawler game for the DS, developed by Nex Entertainment; &quot;Friends&quot; is a Japan-only multiplayer role-playing game for mobile phones; &quot;Dawn&quot; is a 3D action-adventure game for the PlayStation 2; and &quot;Heroes&quot; is a real-time strategy game for the DS, developed by Brownie Brown. While Ishii was the designer for all four games, he served as the director and producer for &quot;Dawn&quot;, which was considered the main game of the four and was released as &quot;Seiken Densetsu 4&quot; in Japan. The theme of the subseries for Ishii, especially &quot;Dawn&quot;, was about exploring how to add &quot;the feeling of touch&quot; to a game. He had held off on designing new &quot;Mana&quot; games after &quot;Legend&quot; was unable to meet his desires, until he felt that technology had improved enough to let him create what he envisioned. A fifth game for the subseries was considered for the Wii in 2006, but did not enter development. In April 2007, a month after the release of the final game of the &quot;World of Mana&quot;, Ishii left Square Enix to lead his own development company, named Grezzo.

The &quot;Mana&quot; series was put on hiatus until 2013, when Square Enix released &quot;Circle of Mana&quot;, a Japan-only card battle game for the GREE mobile platform. It was followed in 2014 by &quot;Rise of Mana&quot;, a Japan-only free-to-play action role-playing game for iOS, Android, and PlayStation Vita, and in 2016 by &quot;Adventures of Mana&quot;, a 3D remake of &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; for the PlayStation Vita, iOS, and Android. On August 25, 2017, a 3D remake of &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; was announced for PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita and Windows, for release on February 15, 2018. A 3D remake of &quot;Trials of Mana&quot; and localization of the original game (as part of the &quot;Collection of Mana&quot;) were announced via Nintendo Direct in 2019.

During the series&#x27; 30th anniversary stream, Square Enix announced a new mobile spin-off game, &quot;Echoes of Mana&quot;, as well as the new console game with involvement from the series creator Koichi Ishii. Titled &quot;Visions of Mana&quot;, it was formally announced at The Game Awards 2023, and is considered the first mainline installment since &quot;Dawn of Mana&quot;. The project was headed by producer Masaru Oyamada, while Ishii worked on the updated creature designs.

=== Creation and design ===
The &quot;Mana&quot; series is the result of Koichi Ishii&#x27;s desire to create a fictional world. In Ishii&#x27;s opinion, &quot;Mana&quot; is not a series of video games, but rather a world which is illustrated by and can be explored through video games. When working on the series, Koichi Ishii draws inspiration from abstract images from his memories of childhood, as well as movies and fantasy books that captivated him as a child. Ishii takes care to avoid set conventions, and his influences are correspondingly very wide and non-specific. Nonetheless, among his literary influences, he acknowledges Tove Jansson&#x27;s &quot;Moomin&quot;, Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, and J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;.

While some titles of the &quot;World of Mana&quot; series do share direct connections with other installments, the games of the series have few concrete links. There is no overall explicit in-game chronological order. Further, according to Koichi Ishii in 2006 the games do not take place in exactly the same world, and characters or elements who appear in different titles are best considered alternate versions of each other. Instead, the connections between each title are more abstract than story-based, linked only on the karmic level. Complicating this assertion, Ishii has also said in an interview that &quot;Children&quot; is set ten years after &quot;Dawn&quot;, while &quot;Heroes&quot; is set one generation prior to &quot;Trials of Mana&quot;.

== Common elements ==

A common element of the series is its seamless, real-time battle system. The system was developed by Koichi Ishii and improved upon by Hiromichi Tanaka, out of a desire to create a system different from the one featured in the first few &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles. While action-based, the &quot;Mana&quot; battle system is intended to be playable even by newcomers as well as veterans. The system is coupled with the distinctive hierarchical &quot;Ring Command&quot; menu system, featured prominently in &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; and &quot;Trials of Mana&quot;, and to a lesser extent in later installments. Each ring is a set of icons with a textual infobox explanation which, upon selection, allow the player to use an item, cast a spell, look up in-game statistics, or change the game&#x27;s settings. Navigation within a menu is achieved by rotating the ring through the cursor left or right, while switching to a different menu is achieved by pressing the up or down buttons. Although not part of the series, the spin-off &quot;Secret of Evermore&quot;, developed by the North American Square Soft, was also built upon the &quot;Ring Command&quot; system.

The &quot;Mana&quot; series features several recurring characters and beings, including the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; creatures Chocobos in &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; and &quot;Legend of Mana&quot;, and Moogles in &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; and as a status ailment in &quot;Trials of Mana&quot; and &quot;Sword of Mana&quot;. Watts is a dwarf blacksmith wearing a horned helmet who upgrades the player&#x27;s weaponry. Usually, an anthropomorphic cat merchant is found outside of town areas and allows a player to save the game and buy supplies at high prices. Neko plays this role in &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;, and Niccolo in &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; and &quot;Sword of Mana&quot;. In the Japanese games these merchants share the name Nikita.

The Mana Tree and the Mana Sword, called Excalibur in &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot;″s English version, are recurring plot devices that have been featured in every game of the series. The mystical Mana Tree is a source of magic that sustains the balance and nature of the series&#x27; world. The Mana Sword is typically used to restore this balance when it becomes lost in the games. &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; explains that if the Mana Tree dies, a member of the Mana Family will become the &quot;seed&quot; of a new Tree. A sprout of the Mana Tree is called a Gemma, while protectors of the Tree, who wield the Mana Sword, are called Gemma Knights. In &quot;Trials of Mana&quot;, a Goddess is said to have turned into the Mana Tree after creating the world with the Mana Sword. The Mana Tree is destroyed near the game ending in &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; and &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;, but a character becomes the new Mana Tree in the former game.

Elemental Spirits, also called Mana Spirits, are beings who govern the magic elements of the series&#x27; world, and are at the core of the games&#x27; magic system as they are used to cast magic spells. Eight types of spirits have appeared in the series since &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;, and each embodies a different element. Their names are homonyms of mythological beings or phenomena. In &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; and &quot;Trials of Mana&quot;, usage of their power is enabled upon the main characters&#x27; meeting with them. In &quot;Legend of Mana&quot;, the spirits serve as factors in the Land Creation System. In &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; and &quot;Sword of Mana&quot;, multiple spirits of the same elemental type appear. In terms of storyline, in &quot;Trials of Mana&quot; and &quot;Heroes of Mana&quot;, the spirits are charged to protect the Mana Stones in which the Mana Goddess sealed eight elemental benevodons (God-Beasts in the fan-translation of &quot;SD3&quot;). In &quot;Dawn of Mana&quot;&#x27;s North American version, each spirit speaks with a particular European accent, such as French or Scottish.

Rabites, known as in the Japanese versions of the games, are cute, fictional, rabbit-like creatures appearing as a common enemy in the series since its beginning. The Rabite has become a sort of mascot for the &quot;Mana&quot; series, much the same way as the Chocobo represents &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, and is one of its most recognizable icons. The Rabite resembles a bodiless, one-toothed rabbit with large ears that curve upward and form a point at the tip, and a round, puffy pink tail that moves by hopping along the ground. It is most commonly yellow colored, but also pink, lilac, black, and white, and are variously minor enemies, &quot;superboss&quot; characters and even friendly units and pets. Rabites are also mentioned in &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; with an accessory comically named &quot;Rabite&#x27;s Foot&quot;, which increases a character&#x27;s luck statistics. Additionally, they appear in &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics Advance&quot; in the description of one of the game&#x27;s optional missions as an endangered species due to being poached for good luck charms. Rabites have appeared prevalently in several pieces of &quot;Mana&quot; merchandise, including plush dolls, cushions, lighters, mousepads, straps, telephone cards, and T-shirts.

Flammie, sometimes spelled Flammy, is the name of a fictional species of flying dragons, as well as the proper name of some its members, featured in several games of the series. A Flammie&#x27;s appearance is a mixture of draconian, mammalian, and reptilian features, and its coloring has varied throughout the series. Flammies typically serve as a means of transportation in the game by allowing a player&#x27;s characters to ride on a Flammie&#x27;s back to different locations in the game&#x27;s world. In &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; and &quot;Trials of Mana&quot;, the Super NES&#x27;s Mode 7 graphic capabilities allows the player to control a Flammie from either a &quot;behind the back&quot; third-person or top-down perspective, and fly over the landscape as it scrolls beneath them. In terms of story, the Flammies were created by the Moon Gods, and are part of an endless cycle of destruction and rebirth as the stronger versions of Flammies—becoming part of a category of creature known as Mana Beasts (Benevodons in &quot;Trials of Mana&quot;), or in Japanese—destroy the world and the Mana Sword and Tree restore the world.

== Music ==

The &quot;Mana&quot; series has had several different composers. &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; was composed by Kenji Ito; it was his second original score. Ito&#x27;s music is mainly inspired by images from the game rather than outside influences. The scores for &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; and &quot;Trials of Mana&quot; were both composed by Hiroki Kikuta. Despite difficulties in dealing with the hardware limitations, Kikuta tried to express, in the music of &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;, two &quot;contrasting styles&quot;, namely himself and the game. This was to create an original score which would be neither pop music nor standard game music. Kikuta worked on the music for the two games mostly by himself, spending nearly 24 hours a day in his office, alternating between composing and editing to create an immersive three-dimensional sound. Kikuta considers the score for &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; his favorite creation. His compositions for &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; and &quot;Trials of Mana&quot; were partly inspired by natural landscapes. In 1995, Kikuta released an experimental album of arranged music from the two installments, titled &quot;Secret of Mana +&quot;, which features one 50-minute-long track.

&quot;Legend of Mana&quot;&#x27;s score was composed by Yoko Shimomura, and of all her compositions, she considers it the one that best expresses herself. Kenji Ito returned to the series with &quot;Sword of Mana&quot;. He also composed roughly one third of the &quot;Children of Mana&quot; soundtrack, while the rest was composed by Masaharu Iwata and Takayuki Aihara. Ito was the main composer for &quot;Dawn of Mana&quot;, assisted by Tsuyoshi Sekito, Masayoshi Soken, and Junya Nakano, as well as main theme composer Ryuichi Sakamoto. In North America, purchasers of &quot;Dawn of Mana&quot; from participating retailers were offered a sampler disc, titled &quot;Breath of Mana&quot;, which features a selection of tracks from the game. Shimomura has returned to the series with &quot;Heroes of Mana&quot;, while also contributing one song to &quot;Rise of Mana&quot;.

== Printed adaptations ==
A five-volume manga based on &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; was drawn by Shiro Amano and published in Japan by Enterbrain between 2000 and 2002. It features a comedic story about the game&#x27;s main character, here named Toto. A German version was published by Egmont Manga &amp; Anime in 2003. A collection of four-panel comic strips, drawn by various authors and titled &quot;Sword of Mana Yonkoma Manga Theatre&quot;, was published in Japan by Square Enix on January 16, 2004. It included a questionnaire that, if sent back, allowed participants to win illustrations signed by Koichi Ishii and Shinichi Kameoka, as well as special T-shirts. Enterbrain also published a &quot;Sword of Mana&quot; manga adaptation in Japan on February 25, 2004, drawn by a collaboration of authors led by Shiro Amano. Two days later, Square Enix published a two-volume novelization of &quot;Sword of Mana&quot; in Japan written by Matsui Oohama. An original manga, named &quot;Seiken Densetsu: Princess of Mana&quot;, taking place 300 years after &quot;Children of Mana&quot; and starring the descendant of Ferrick, was drawn by Satsuki Yoshino and published in the Japanese magazine &quot;Gangan Powered&quot; from July 22, 2006, to May 27, 2010 and collected into five volumes.
== Reception ==
The &quot;Mana&quot; series has been mostly well received, though each title has seen varied levels of success. RPGFan called &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; one of the best things to happen to the Game Boy, while IGN considered it the best action RPG on the console after &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot;. GameSpot referred to &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; as &quot;one of Square&#x27;s masterpieces on the SNES&quot;. The game has appeared on several list of top games, including ranked number 97 on &quot;Famitsu&quot;&#x27;s top 100 games of all time. &quot;Trials of Mana&quot; was called &quot;easily one of the best RPGs to come out of the 16-bit era&quot; by Nintendo Life. &quot;Famitsu&quot; rated &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; at 31/40 and &quot;Heroes of Mana&quot; at 32/40. The NPD Group ranked &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; as the top seller the week of its release, and in 2006 was re-released as part of the Ultimate Hits series.

Many of the &quot;World of Mana&quot; titles have not been as critically successful as the original five games in the series, and though the franchise has been praised for their attempts at trying new ways of experiencing the games&#x27; fictional world, there have been various gameplay design flaws that have hindered the later games. 1UP.com commented that despite the game&#x27;s excellent presentation and storytelling, &quot;Dawn of Mana&quot; did not match the level of gameplay of the early &quot;Mana&quot; games. Prior to the &quot;World of Mana&quot; games, RPGamer called the series a &quot;treasured favorite&quot;. After the release of &quot;Heroes of Mana&quot;, they commented that the &quot;World of Mana&quot; series is &quot;cursed&quot;, and the future of the series looked &quot;bleak&quot;.

The music of the &quot;Mana&quot; series, especially &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;, has received wide acclaim and fan enthusiasm. The &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; soundtrack was one of the first official soundtracks of video games music released in the United States and thus before fully mainstream interest in RPGs. The &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;″s opening theme, &quot;Angel&#x27;s Fear&quot;, was rated at number 7 on IGN&#x27;s Top Ten RPG Title tracks, calling it a &quot;magical title song that captures our hearts&quot;. It was also featured in the third Orchestral Game Concert. &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; is also the number 6 most remixed soundtrack on the popular video game music site OverClocked ReMix, with &quot;Trials of Mana&quot; tied at 18. The music of the other titles have also been well received. RPGFan called the music to &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; &quot;addictive&quot;, despite its low, MIDI-like quality. GameSpy called &quot;Children of Mana&quot;″s music some of the best Nintendo DS music yet and referred to it as &quot;beautiful&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot; complimented &quot;Dawn of Mana&quot;″s music, calling it good. IGN referred to &quot;Legend of Mana&quot;″s music as &quot;beautiful&quot; and stated the background music brought &quot;intensity&quot;, &quot;suspense&quot;, and &quot;subtle nuance&quot; to the game. Other reviewers echoed similar praise to GameSpot, calling the music &quot;excellently orchestrated&quot; and RPGFan calling it one of the game&#x27;s good points.

The &quot;Mana&quot; series has sold well overall, and as of March 2011, series titles have sold over 6 million units. The original &quot;Seiken Densetsu&quot; sold over 700,000 units, and its remake &quot;Sword of Mana&quot; sold over 277,000 copies in Japan. &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; has shipped over 1.83 million copies worldwide. &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; sold over 400,000 units in its first week alone as the highest-selling release that week in Japan, and over 700,000 copies in Japan by the end of the year. &quot;Children of Mana&quot; sold over 281,000 copies in Japan, and &quot;Dawn of Mana&quot; sold over 410,000 copies worldwide. &quot;Heroes of Mana&quot; sold over 178,000 copies worldwide. The PlayStation Vita version of &quot;Rise of Mana&quot; downloaded over 100,000 times. By 2021, the game series had sold over 8 million copies.

<text>The Pacific Community (PC), formerly the South Pacific Commission (SPC), is an international development organisation governed by 27 members, including 22 Pacific island countries and territories around the Pacific Ocean. The organisation&#x27;s headquarters are in Nouméa, New Caledonia, and it has regional offices in Suva, Pohnpei, and Port Vila, as well as field staff in other locations in the Pacific. Its working languages are English and French. It primarily provides technical and scientific advice, and acts as a conduit for funding of development projects from donor nations. Unlike the slightly smaller Pacific Islands Forum, PaciCom is not a trade bloc, and does not deal with military or security issues.

PaciCom&#x27;s regional development issues include climate change, disaster risk management, fisheries, food security, education, gender equality, human rights, non-communicable diseases, agriculture, forestry and land use, water resources, and youth employment.

== History ==
The Pacific Community was founded in 1947 as the South Pacific Commission by six developed countries with strategic interests and territories in the region: Australia, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

The SPC&#x27;s founding charter is the Canberra Agreement. In the aftermath of World War II, the six colonial powers which created the SPC arguably intended it to secure Western political and military interests in the postwar Pacific. Two founding members, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, have since withdrawn from the SPC as the Pacific territories they controlled either gained independence or the right to represent themselves in the organization.

From the start, the SPC&#x27;s role was constrained. The invitation from Australia and New Zealand to the US, France, the Netherlands and the UK to participate in a South Seas Commission Conference in 1947 included the statement that &quot;the [South Pacific] Commission to be set up should not be empowered to deal in any way with political matters or questions of defense or security&quot;. This constraint on discussion (particularly the constraint on discussing nuclear weapons testing in the region) led to the 1971 creation of the South Pacific Forum (now Pacific Islands Forum), which not only excluded the more distant &quot;metropolitan&quot; powers of France, UK and US, but also at the time their Pacific island territories.

In 1949, the Pacific Community established its permanent headquarters in Nouméa, New Caledonia, at a former American military base. In 1995, a new headquarters was constructed close to the same location and the military base was demolished. A monument and plaque commemorating SPC&#x27;s original headquarters location can be found on site of the Le Promenade complex at Anse Vata.

In 1962, the Pacific Community created the South Pacific Games Council with the goal of holding a regular Pacific wide sporting event. The first games Games were held in Suva, Fiji in 1963, with 646 participants from 13 Pacific territories taking part. Initially the Games were held at three-year intervals although this was subsequently expanded to four following the Tumon Games in Guam.

Dutch New Guinea, formerly represented in the SPC by the Netherlands, was transferred to United Nations authority in 1962 and to Indonesia the following year. Without any territory remaining in the region, the Netherlands withdrew from the SPC in 1962.

Governance of the SPC reflected the changing political environment. At inception, each member had equal representation and a single vote. When Western Samoa joined as newly independent state in 1965 the rules were changed to ensure that the Western foundation nations would maintain firm control over the organization. Australia was given five votes, France, Britain, New Zealand, and the United States four and Western Samoa just one.

In 1972, the first South Pacific Arts Festival was convened by SPC in Suva, Fiji. The event drew more than 1000 participants from 14 countries. In 1975 SPC created a Council of Pacific Arts, permanently making culture issues a part of the SPC mandate and establishing the Festival of Pacific Arts as a regular event.

In response to demand to rapid development of the Pacific regions media industry, SPC established a Regional Media Center in 1973 in collaboration with the recently created University of the South Pacific. The center produced audio material for the regions radio stations and provided training in video production.

With decolonization efforts expanding, newly independent states and nonindependent territories were also allowed to apply for membership. &quot;As its membership grew, the character and scope of the SPC evolved to incorporate the indigenous peoples of the Pacific.&quot;

In 1983, at the Saipan Conference, unequal voting was abandoned, once again establishing a &quot;one member, one vote&quot; principle for SPC. However, this decision did not come without criticism as some pointed out that the combination of allowing membership to non-independent territories and establishing a one-vote per member principle effectively provided additional votes to France and the United States who continued to maintain control over Pacific territories. It was also during the Saipan Conference that the Committee of Representatives of Governments and Administrations (CRGA) was established, creating the only Pacific regional organization that was both fully representative of the Pacific, and fully governed by its membership.

In 1988, the SPC become a founding member of the Council of Regional Organisations in the Pacific or CROP (formerly the South Pacific Organisations Coordinating Committee, SPOCC) &quot;to improve cooperation, coordination, and collaboration among the various intergovernmental regional organisations to work toward achieving the common goal of sustainable development in the Pacific region&quot;.

The United Kingdom withdrew from the organisation in 1996 and rejoined in 1998. The UK withdrew a second time in 2004. The UK&#x27;s interests in the Pacific Community were prior to Brexit primarily managed through the European Union, although the UK also is a direct donor for some projects. The UK rejoined in 2021 after reopening its high commissions in Tonga, Samoa and its embassy in Vanuatu in the past two years.

In 1996, the Pacific Heads of Agriculture and Livestock Programmes asked &quot;to put in place, both in their countries and through regional cooperation, policies to conserve, protect and best utilize their plant genetic resources&quot;. As these resources were considered a shared regional responsibility, it made sense for a regional organization to respond to this need. SPC established the Regional Germplasm Centre (RGC) in 1998. The facility grew rapidly and in 2007 was renamed Centre for Pacific Crops and Trees (CePaCT). It currently holds more than 2000 varieties of genetic material on Pacific strains of taro, banana, breadfruit and others, and has been instrumental in helping to rebuild island agriculture after disasters.

In 2000, SPC became the first CROP organization to be headed by a woman, Lourdes Pangelinan of Guam, who served in the role from 2000 to 2006.

=== Pacific Way television series ===
The SPC began producing a television program, known as &quot;The Pacific Way&quot;, in 1995. Supported by UNESCO as a trial for exchanging news stories, the first season was shared freely with just one tape circulated between TV stations in several Pacific Island nations. The programs&#x27; regional and local focus made it popular addition to local television schedules and at its height was producing and distributing 26 annual episodes to 21 TV stations around the region. Since 2017, the Pacific Way has been developing 10 episodes per season for television and has been reintroduced to radio through its complementary podcasts. The half-hour show shares development stories about the Pacific for the Pacific. It covers important topics and key issues, such as climate change adaptation, health, youth employment, innovation in agriculture, fisheries management and the protection of cultural heritage.

=== Name and logo ===
While the acronym &quot;SPC&quot; has been consistent since the organization&#x27;s founding in 1947, the name and logo have evolved over the years. The organization&#x27;s original name was the South Pacific Commission, which represented the limited nature of its membership and activities. The name was changed in 1997 to the Pacific Community, reflecting the growth of membership across the entire Pacific region. The current logo was officially adopted in 2015.

== Present ==
The Pacific Community today includes 22 Pacific island countries and territories, which were all previously territories (or, in the case of Tonga, a protectorate) of the original founding members of the SPC, along with the developed countries of Australia, France, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States:

The SPC is concentrated on providing technical and scientific advice to its member governments and administrations, particularly in areas where small island states lack the wherewithal to maintain purely national cadres of expertise, or in areas where regional co-operation or interaction is necessary.

The operational budget of the Pacific Community in 2018 was approximately €82 million. The organization is financially supported through a combination of membership fees and donor funding. Its major funding partners include the European Union, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the governments of France and the United States. Additional funding and knowledge partners include:

=== Divisions ===
The SPC works across more than 25 sectors. It is involved in such areas as fisheries science, public health surveillance, geoscience and conservation of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, statistics and education. Using a multi-sector approach in responding to its members&#x27; development priorities, SPC draws on skills and capabilities from around the region and internationally, and supports the empowerment of Pacific communities and sharing of expertise and skills between countries and territories.

SPC currently has nine divisions:

* Climate Change and Environmental Stability (CCES) 
*Educational Quality and Assessment Program (EQAP)
* Fisheries, Aquaculture and Marine Ecosystems (FAME)
* Geoscience Energy and Maritime (GEM)
* Land Resources Division (LRD)
* Public Health Division (PHD)
* Regional Rights Resource Team (RRRT)
* Social Development Program (SDP)
* Statistics for Development (SDD)

<doc id="260844" wikidata="Q253789" url="?curid=260844" title="Mergus">
<text>Mergus is the genus of the typical mergansers ( ) fish-eating ducks in the subfamily Anatinae. The genus name is a Latin word used by Pliny the Elder and other Roman authors to refer to an unspecified waterbird.

The common merganser (&quot;Mergus merganser&quot;) and red-breasted merganser (&quot;M. serrator&quot;) have broad ranges in the northern hemisphere. The Brazilian merganser (&quot;M. octosetaceus&quot;) is a South American duck, and one of the six most threatened waterfowl in the world, with possibly fewer than 250 birds in the wild. The scaly-sided merganser or &quot;Chinese merganser&quot; (&quot;M. squamatus&quot;) is an endangered species. It lives in temperate East Asia, breeding in the north and wintering in the south.

The hooded merganser (&quot;Lophodytes cucullatus&quot;, formerly known as &quot;Mergus cucullatus&quot;) is not of this genus but is closely related. The other &quot;aberrant&quot; merganser, the smew (&quot;Mergellus albellus&quot;), is phylogenetically closer to goldeneyes (&quot;Bucephala&quot;).

Although they are seaducks, most of the mergansers prefer riverine habitats, with only the red-breasted merganser being common at sea. These large fish-eaters typically have black-and-white, brown and/or green hues in their plumage, and most have somewhat shaggy crests. All have serrated edges to their long and thin bills that help them grip their prey. Along with the smew and hooded merganser, they are therefore often known as &quot;sawbills&quot;. The goldeneyes, on the other hand, feed mainly on mollusks, and therefore have a more typical duck-bill.

&quot;Mergus&quot; ducks are also classified as &quot;diving ducks&quot; because they submerge completely in looking for food. In other traits, however, the genera &quot;Mergus&quot;, &quot;Lophodytes&quot;, &quot;Mergellus&quot;, and &quot;Bucephala&quot; are very similar: uniquely among all Anseriformes, they do not have notches at the hind margin of their sternum, but holes surrounded by bone.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Mergus&quot; was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The genus name is the Latin word for an unidentified waterbird mentioned by Pliny the Elder and other authors; some sources have identified the original &quot;mergus&quot; as referring to either a cormorant or Scopoli&#x27;s shearwater. The type species was designated as &quot;Mergus serrator&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 (the red-breasted merganser) by Thomas Campbell Eyton in 1838.

===Recent species===
The genus contains four living species and two recently extinct species.





=== Fossil species ===
Some fossil members of this genus have been described:
* &quot;Mergus miscellus&quot; is known from the Middle Miocene Calvert Formation (Barstovian, c.14 million years ago) of Virginia, USA.
* &quot;Mergus connectens&quot; lived in the Early Pleistocene about 2–1 million years ago, in Central and Eastern Europe.

The Early Oligocene booby &quot;&quot;Sula&quot; ronzoni&quot; was at first mistakenly believed to be a typical merganser. A Late Serravallian (13–12 million years ago) fossil sometimes attributed to &quot;Mergus&quot;, found in the Sajóvölgyi Formation of Mátraszőlős, Hungary, probably belongs to &quot;Mergellus&quot;. The affiliations of the mysterious &quot;&quot;Anas&quot; albae&quot; from the Messinian (c. 7–5 million years ago) of Hungary are undetermined; it was initially believed to be a typical merganser too.

<text>Petronius Maximus (31 May 455) was Roman emperor of the West for two and a half months in 455. A wealthy senator and a prominent aristocrat, he was instrumental in the murders of the Western Roman &quot;magister militum&quot;, Aëtius, and the Western Roman emperor, Valentinian III.

After the assassination of the Western Roman magister militum, Aëtius, and the subsequent death of the Western Roman emperor, Valentinian III, Maximus secured the support of the Senate and utilized bribery to gain the favor of palace officials, enabling him to ascend to power. He strengthened his position by forcing Licinia Eudoxia, Valentinian&#x27;s widow, to marry him and forcing her daughter Eudocia to marry his son, cancelling her betrothal to the son of the Vandal king Genseric. This infuriated both Eudocia and Genseric, who sent a fleet to Rome. Maximus failed to obtain troops from the Visigoths and he fled as the Vandals arrived, became detached from his retinue and bodyguard in the confusion, and was killed by fellow Romans. The Vandals thoroughly sacked Rome in their retaliatory invasion.

The reign of Petronius Maximus marked a significant period of instability and decline for the Western Roman Empire. His brief and controversial rule reflected the political fragmentation and lack of centralized authority that plagued the empire during its final years. The invasion and sacking of Rome by the Vandals underlined the growing vulnerability of the Western Roman Empire, which would ultimately culminate in its collapse in 476.

==Early career==
Petronius Maximus was born about 397. Although he was of obscure origin, it is believed that he belonged to the Anicius and Petronius families. Related to the later Emperor Olybrius, Maximus was the son of Anicius Probinus, and the grandson of Anicia Faltonia Proba and Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus, who was prefect of Illyricum in 364, prefect of Gaul in 366, prefect of Italy from 368 to 375 and again in 383 and consul in 371. Procopius claimed that he was a descendant of Emperor Magnus Maximus, but historians such as J. B. Bury consider this account &quot;untrustworthy and improbable&quot;.

Maximus had a remarkable early career. His earliest known office was &quot;praetor&quot;, held in about 411; around 415 he served as a &quot;tribunus et notarius&quot;, which was an entry position to the imperial bureaucracy and led to his serving as &quot;comes sacrarum largitionum&quot; (count of the sacred largess) between 416 and 419. Maximus spent 4,000 gold librae on public games in 412 or 415. From January or February 420 to August or September 421, he served as &quot;praefectus urbi&quot; of Rome, granting him executive authority for much of the municipal administration of Rome; he held the office again sometime before 439. During his tenure as &quot;praefectus&quot;, he undertook the restoration of the Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. Additionally, He was also appointed praetorian prefect, a leading military and judicial position, sometime between 421 and 439. It was either while holding this post or during his second urban prefecture that he was appointed consul for the year 433. Attaining the position of consul was considered the highest honor in the Roman state.

From 28 August 439 to 14 March 441, Maximus held the praetorian prefecture of Italy, the most important administrative and judicial non-imperial position in the Western Empire, and succeeded in that office by Anicius Acilius Glabrio Faustus. He was awarded a second consulship in 443. In 445, he was granted the title of patrician, the empire&#x27;s senior honorific title, which was limited to a very small number of holders. During this year he was briefly the most honoured of all non-imperial Romans until the third consulate of Flavius Aëtius, generalissimo, or &quot;magister militum&quot;, of the Western Empire, the following year. Between 443 and 445 Maximus built a forum, the &quot;Forum Petronii Maximi&quot;, in Rome, on the Caelian Hill between the via Labicana and the Basilica di San Clemente.

==Murder of Valentinian III and accession of Maximus==
According to the historian John of Antioch, Maximus poisoned the mind of the Emperor against Aëtius, resulting in the murder of his rival at the hands of Valentinian III. John&#x27;s account has it that Valentinian and Maximus placed a wager on a game that Maximus ended up losing. As he did not have the money available, Maximus left his ring as a guarantee of his debt. Valentinian then used the ring to summon to court Lucina, the chaste and beautiful wife of Maximus, whom Valentinian had long lusted after. Lucina went to the court, believing she had been summoned by her husband, but instead found herself at dinner with Valentinian. Although she initially resisted his advances, the Emperor managed to wear her down and succeeded in raping her. Returning home and meeting Maximus, she accused him of betrayal, believing that he had handed her over to the Emperor. Although Maximus swore revenge, he was equally motivated by ambition to supplant &quot;a detested and despicable rival&quot;, so he decided to move against Valentinian.

According to John of Antioch, Maximus was acutely aware that while Aëtius was alive he could not exact vengeance on Valentinian, so Aëtius had to be removed. He therefore allied himself with a eunuch of Valentinian&#x27;s, the &quot;primicerius sacri cubiculi&quot; Heraclius, who had long opposed the general, with the hope of exercising more power over the emperor. The two of them convinced Valentinian that Aëtius was planning to assassinate him and urged him to kill his &quot;magister militum&quot; during a meeting, which Valentinian did with his own hands, with the help of Heraclius, on 21 September 454.

Once Aëtius was dead, Maximus asked Valentinian for Aëtius&#x27;s now-vacant position, but the Emperor refused; Moreover, Heraclius had advised the Emperor not to allow anyone to possess the power that Aëtius had wielded. According to John of Antioch, Maximus was so irritated by Valentinian&#x27;s refusal to appoint him as his &quot;magister militum&quot; that he decided to have Valentinian assassinated as well. He chose as accomplices Optilia and Thraustila, two Scythians who had fought under the command of Aetius and who, after the death of their general, had been appointed as Valentinian&#x27;s escort.

Maximus easily convinced them that Valentinian was the only one responsible for the death of Aetius, and that the two soldiers must avenge their old commander, while at the same time also promising them a reward for the betrayal of the Emperor. On 16 March 455 Valentinian, who was in Rome, went to Campus Martius with some guards, accompanied by Optilia, Thraustila and their men. As soon as the Emperor dismounted to practice with the bow, Optilia came up with his men and stabbed him in the temple. As Valentinian turned to look at his attacker, Optila finished him off with another thrust of his blade. At the same moment, Thraustila killed Heraclius. The two Scythians took the imperial diadem and robe and brought them to Maximus.

The sudden and violent death of Valentinian III left the Western Roman Empire without an obvious successor to the throne. Several candidates were supported by various groups of the imperial bureaucracy and the military. In particular, the army&#x27;s support was split among three main candidates: Maximianus, the former &quot;domesticus&quot; (bodyguard) of Aëtius, who was the son of an Egyptian merchant named Domninus who had become rich in Italy; the future emperor Majorian, who commanded the army after the death of Aetius and who had the backing of the Empress Licinia Eudoxia; and Maximus himself, who had the support of the Roman Senate and who secured the throne on 17 March by distributing money to the officials of the imperial palace.

==Reign and death==
After gaining control of the royal palace, Maximus consolidated his hold on power by immediately marrying Licinia Eudoxia, the widow of Valentinian. She married him reluctantly, suspecting that he had been involved in the murder of her late husband; and indeed Maximus treated Valentinian III&#x27;s assassins with considerable favour. The eastern court at Constantinople refused to recognise his accession. To further secure his position Maximus quickly appointed Avitus as &quot;magister militum&quot; and sent him on a mission to Toulouse to gain the support of the Visigoths. He also proceeded to cancel the betrothal of Licinia&#x27;s daughter, Eudocia, to Huneric, the son of the Vandal king Geiseric, and married her to his own son. Again he anticipated that this would further his and his family&#x27;s imperial credentials. This repudiation infuriated the Vandal king, who only needed the excuse of Licinia&#x27;s despairing appeal to the Vandal court to begin preparations for the invasion of Italy.

By May, within two months of Maximus gaining the throne, news reached Rome that Geiseric was sailing for Italy. As the news spread, panic gripped the city and many of its inhabitants took to flight. The Emperor, aware that Avitus had not yet returned with the expected Visigothic aid, decided that it was fruitless to mount a defence against the Vandals. So he attempted to organise his escape, urging the Senate to accompany him. However, in the panic, Petronius Maximus was abandoned by his bodyguard and entourage and left to fend for himself.

As Maximus rode out of the city on his own on 31 May 455, he was set upon by an angry mob, which stoned him to death (another account has it that he was killed by &quot;a certain Roman soldier named Ursus&quot;). His body was mutilated and flung into the Tiber. He had reigned for only 75 days. His son from his first marriage, Palladius, who had held the title of caesar between 17 March and 31 May, and who had married his stepsister Eudocia, was probably executed.

==Aftermath==
On 2 June 455, three days after Maximus&#x27; death, Geiseric captured the city of Rome and sacked it for two weeks. Amidst the pillaging and looting of the city, and in response to the pleas of Pope Leo I, the Vandals are said to have refrained from arson, torture, and murder. Some modern historians assert that temples, public buildings, private houses and even the emperor&#x27;s palace were destroyed. The Vandals also shipped many boatloads of Romans to North Africa as slaves, destroyed works of art and killed a number of citizens. The Vandals&#x27; activities during the sack gave rise to the modern term vandalism. Geiseric also carried away the empress Licinia Eudoxia and her daughters Placidia and Eudocia.

<text>The vireos make up a family, Vireonidae, of small to medium-sized passerine birds found in the New World (Canada to Argentina, including Bermuda and the West Indies) and Southeast Asia. The family contains 62 species and is divided into eight genera. &quot;Vireo&quot; is a Latin word referring to a green migratory bird, perhaps the female golden oriole, possibly the European greenfinch.

They are typically dull-plumaged and greenish in color, the smaller species resembling wood warblers apart from their heavier bills. They range in size from the Chocó vireo, dwarf vireo and lesser greenlet, all at around 10 cm and 8g, to the peppershrikes and shrike-vireos at up to 17 cm and 40g.

==Distribution and habitat==
Most species are found in Middle America and northern South America. Thirteen species of true vireos occur farther north, in the United States, Bermuda and Canada; of these all but Hutton&#x27;s vireo are migratory. Members of the family seldom fly long distances except in migration. They inhabit forest environments, with different species preferring forest canopies, undergrowth, or mangrove swamps.

A few species in the genus &quot;Vireo&quot; have appeared on the eastern side of the Atlantic as vagrants to the Western Palearctic.

==Behaviour==
The resident species occur in pairs or family groups that maintain territories all year (except Hutton&#x27;s vireo, which joins mixed feeding flocks). Most of the migrants defend winter territories against conspecifics. The exceptions are the complex comprising the red-eyed vireo, the yellow-green vireo, the black-whiskered vireo, and the Yucatan vireo, which winter in small wandering flocks.

===Voice===

Males of most species are persistent singers. Songs are usually rather simple, monotonous in some species of the Caribbean littoral and islands, and most elaborate and pleasant to human ears in the Chocó vireo and the peppershrikes.

===Breeding===
The nests of many tropical species are unknown. Of those that are known, all build a cup-shaped nest that hangs from branches. The female does most of the incubation, spelled by the male except in the red-eyed vireo complex.

===Feeding===
All members of the family eat some fruit but mostly insects and other arthropods. They take prey from leaves and branches; true vireos also flycatch, and the gray vireo takes 5 percent of its prey from the ground.

==Systematics==
The family Vireonidae is related to the crow-like birds in family Corvidae and the shrikes in family Laniidae as part of superfamily Corvoidea. As currently circumscribed the family is made up of eight genera.

Traditionally the family was considered to include four New World genera containing the true vireos (&quot;Vireo&quot;), the greenlets (&quot;Hylophilus&quot;), the shrike-vireos (&quot;Vireolanius&quot;) and the peppershrikes (&quot;Cyclarhis&quot;). However, phylogenetic studies found &quot;Hylophilus&quot; to be polyphyletic, with the greenlets split into three distinct groups: the &quot;scrub&quot; greenlets in a restricted &quot;Hylophilus&quot;, the &quot;canopy&quot; greenlets in resurrected genus &quot;Pachysylvia&quot; and the tawny-crowned greenlet in new genus &quot;Tunchiornis&quot;.

In addition, biochemical studies have identified two babbler genera (&quot;Pteruthius&quot; and &quot;Erpornis&quot;) which may be Old World members of this family. Observers have commented on the vireo-like behaviour of the &quot;Pteruthius&quot; shrike-babblers, but apparently no-one suspected the biogeographically unlikely possibility of vireo relatives in Asia. Some recent taxonomic treatements, such as the IOC taxonomy followed here, include &quot;Pteruthius&quot; and &quot;Erpornis&quot; in Vireionidae, whereas other place them in their own families Pteruthidae and Erpornidae.

<doc id="260858" wikidata="Q313286" url="?curid=260858" title="Demetrius of Phalerum">
<text>Demetrius of Phalerum (also Demetrius of Phaleron or Demetrius Phalereus; ; c. 350 – c. 280 BC) was an Athenian orator originally from Phalerum, an ancient port of Athens. A student of Theophrastus, and perhaps of Aristotle, he was one of the first members of the Peripatetic school of philosophy. Demetrius had been a distinguished statesman who was appointed by Cassander, the King of Macedon, to govern Athens, where Demetrius ruled as sole ruler for ten years. During this time, he introduced important reforms of the legal system, while also maintaining pro-Cassander oligarchic rule.

Demetrius was exiled by his enemies in 307 BC. He first went to Thebes, and then, after 297 BC, went to the court of Alexandria. He wrote extensively on the subjects of history, rhetoric, and literary criticism. He is not to be confused with his grandson, also called Demetrius of Phaleron, who probably served as regent of Athens between 262 and 255, on behalf of the Macedonian King Antigonos Gonatas.

==Life==
Demetrius was born in Phalerum, c. 350 BC. He was the son of Phanostratus, a man without rank or property, and was brother to the anti-Macedonian orator Himeraeus. He was educated, together with the poet Menander, in the school of Theophrastus. He began his public career about 325 BC, at the time of the disputes concerning Harpalus, and soon acquired a great reputation by the talent he displayed in public speaking. He belonged to the pro-oligarchic party of Phocion, and he acted in the spirit of that statesman. When Xenocrates was unable to pay the new tax on metics (foreign residents) c. 322 BC, and the Athenians threatened him with slavery, he was only saved (according to one story) when Demetrius purchased his debt and paid his tax. After the death of Phocion in 317 BC, Cassander placed Demetrius at the head of the administration of Athens. He filled this office for ten years, instituting extensive legal reforms. The Athenians conferred upon him the most extraordinary distinctions (almost all of which were revoked after his later expulsion from Athens), and no fewer than 360 statues were erected to him. However, Demetrius was unpopular with the lower classes of Athenians and with pro-democratic political factions, who resented the limitations he placed on the democratic franchise and viewed him as little more than a pro-Macedonian puppet ruler.

According to Stephen V. Tracy, the story about the statues was not historical; also he argues that Demetrius later played a big role in the foundation of the Library of Alexandria.

He remained in power until 307 BC when Cassander&#x27;s enemy, Demetrius Poliorcetes, captured Athens, and Demetrius was obliged to take to flight. It was claimed that during the latter period of his administration he had abandoned himself to every kind of excess, and we are told he squandered 1200 talents a year on dinners, parties, and love affairs. Carystius of Pergamum mentions that he had a lover by the name of Theognis, of whom all the Athenian boys were jealous. After his exile, his enemies contrived to induce the people of Athens to pass the death sentence upon him, in consequence of which his friend Menander nearly fell victim. All his statues, with the exception of one, were demolished.

Demetrius first went to Thebes, and then (after Cassander&#x27;s death in 297 BC) to the court of Ptolemy I Soter at Alexandria, with whom he lived for many years on the best terms, and who is even said to have entrusted to him the revision of the laws of his kingdom. During his stay at Alexandria, he devoted himself mainly to literary pursuits, ever cherishing the recollection of his own country.

On the accession of Ptolemy Philadelphus, Demetrius fell into disfavour (he apparently supported the wrong candidate, Ptolemy Keraunos), and was sent into exile to Upper Egypt. According to one account a statue at Memphis Saqqara was attributed to him. He is said to have died from the bite of a venomous snake and was buried in Diospolis Kato. His death appears to have taken place soon after the year 283 BC.

==Works and legacy==
===Literary works===
Demetrius was the last among the Attic orators worthy of the name, after which the activity went into a decline. His orations were characterised as being soft, graceful, and elegant, rather than sublime like those of Demosthenes. His numerous writings, the greater part of which he probably composed during his residence in Egypt, embraced a wide range of subjects, and the list of them given by Diogenes Laërtius shows that he was a man of the most extensive acquirements. These works, which were partly historical, partly political, partly philosophical (e.g. &quot;Aisopeia&quot;, a collection of Aesopic Fables), and partly poetical, have all perished. The work &quot;On Style&quot; () which has come down under his name, is the work of a later writer, c. 2nd century AD.

===Education and arts===
The performance of tragedy had fallen into disuse in Athens, on account of the great expense involved. In order to afford the people less costly and yet intellectual amusement, he caused the Homeric and other poems to be recited on the stage by rhapsodists.

According to Strabo, Demetrius inspired the creation of the Mouseion, the location of the Library of Alexandria, which was modelled after the arrangement of Aristotle&#x27;s school. The Mouseion contained a &quot;peripatos&quot; (covered walkway), a &quot;syssition&quot; (room for communal dining) and a categorized organization of scrolls.

According to the earliest source of information, the pseudepigraphic &quot;Letter of Aristeas&quot; composed between , the library was initially organized by Demetrius of Phaleron, under the reign of Ptolemy I Soter (). Other sources claim it was instead created under the reign of his son Ptolemy II (283–246 BC).

==Cultural references==

===Diogenes Laërtius===
Diogenes Laërtius devotes a section of his &quot;The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot; to Demetrius Phalereus.

===Hegel===
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, in the &quot;Lectures on the History of Philosophy&quot;, says of Demetrius Phalereus that &quot;Demetrius Phalereus and others were thus soon after [Alexander] honoured and worshipped in Athens as God.&quot; What the exact source was for Hegel&#x27;s claim is unclear. Diogenes Laërtius does not mention this.

Apparently, Hegel&#x27;s error comes from a misreading of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Demetrius&quot; which is about Demetrius Poliorcetes and not Demetrius Phalereus. But Plutarch describes in the work how Demetrius Poliorcetes conquered Demetrius Phalereus at Athens. Then, in chapter 12 of the work, Plutarch describes how Demetrius Poliorcetes was given honours due to the god Dionysus. Somehow this account by Plutarch was confusing not only for Hegel but for others as well.

<text>Procopius (; Ancient Greek: Προκόπιος; 326 – 27 May 366) was a Roman usurper against Valens.

== Life ==
Procopius was a native of Cilicia and born in Corycus around the year 326. On his mother&#x27;s side, Procopius was a maternal cousin to Emperor Julian, since their maternal grandfather was Julius Julianus. His first wife was probably Artemisia. The Roman general of the 5th century Procopius and his son, the Emperor Anthemius, were among his descendants, the first being the son of his son Procopius.

During the reign of Constantius II, he served as &quot;tribunus et notarius&quot; for a long period of time. By 358, the emperor trusted him enough to send him with Lucillianus as an envoy to the Sassanid court. His career granted him the opportunity to build many important connections, as well as to help him understand the structure of the imperial government.

== Persian campaign ==
When Julian departed from Constantinople in the spring of 362, his objective was clear: to launch a swift, decisive campaign against the Sasanian Empire rather than engage in a prolonged war. His primary aim was to strike directly at the Sassanid capital Ctesiphon and force Shapur II into a battle or negotiations. Procopius entered Julian&#x27;s retinue and took part in his campaign against the Sassanids in 363. After leaving Antioch on March 5, 363, Julian’s army quickly crossed the Euphrates river, gathering at Carrhae shortly thereafter. 

=== Into enemy territory ===
Meanwhile, Procopius was entrusted with fortifying Roman defenses in Mesopotamia. Tasked with leading a force of around 30,000 men, Procopius and his subordinate, Sebastianus, were stationed to defend key positions along the Upper Tigris River, anticipating an advance from Shapur’s forces. Procopius was tasked with coordinating Roman defensive efforts in the east, specifically working with King Arsaces II of Armenia to secure the strategically vital Bitlis Pass. Procopius&#x27; efforts were vital in securing the eastern front and preparing for the Persian response to Julian&#x27;s offensive.

Procopius prepared for the possibility of advancing his troops southward to join with Emperor Julian’s soldiers in Assyria. This location was crucial for controlling access between the Roman and Persian spheres of influence, and its defense was integral to safeguarding the Roman presence in the region. In a display of military strategy, Emperor Julian led a formidable force of 65,000 soldiers down the Euphrates River within just eight weeks. However, Julian was fatally injured in a skirmish on June 26, bringing an abrupt end to the ill-fated campaign. When Procopius reached the main Roman army near Thilsaphata, between Nisibis and Singara, he met the new emperor, Jovian.

Though Julian had died without naming a successor, a rumor spread that he had ordered Procopius to take the purple in case of his death. Fearing Jovian&#x27;s wrath, which had caused the death of another army candidate to the throne (Jovianus), Procopius went into hiding, but later supervised the transport of Julian&#x27;s body to Tarsus and its subsequent burial, and only later went to Caesarea with his family.

After Jovian&#x27;s death, the new emperors, Valentinian I and Valens, sent some soldiers to arrest Procopius. He surrendered, but asked to meet his family; he had his captors dine and drink, and then seized the opportunity to flee with his family, first to the Black Sea and later to the Tauric Chersonese, where they hid. However, Procopius lived in constant fear of betrayal or exposure, and decided to go to Constantinople, the Empire&#x27;s capital, to ask Strategius for help.

Becoming aware of discontent caused by the policies of Valens&#x27;s praetorian prefect and father-in-law, Petronius, Procopius decided to declare himself Emperor. He bribed two legions which were then resting at Constantinople to support his efforts, and took control of the imperial city. Shortly after this he proclaimed himself Emperor on 28 September 365, and quickly took control of the provinces of Thrace, and later Bithynia. Procopius promoted himself as an educated philosopher, well versed in the Greek language of the Eastern Empire, and highlighted Valens&#x27;s weakness in this area, to gain the support of the Hellenized Eastern aristocrats. He also emphasized his link to the Constantinian dynasty by appearing in public with Constantius II’s widow Faustina and their daughter Constantia, an act which Ammianus considered to have earned him greater support.

Though Valens initially despaired of subduing the rebellion, and was inclined to come to terms with the usurper, he quickly rallied, guided by the counsels of Salutius and Arintheus, and the superior ability of his generals prevailed in two battles at Thyatira and Nacolia where Procopius&#x27;s forces were defeated. He fled the battlefield, and was for a while a fugitive in the wilds of Phrygia, but was soon betrayed to Valens due to the treachery of his two generals Agilonius and Gomoarius, he was captured. Valens had his rival executed on 27 May 366 through beheading. His head was then sent to Valens&#x27;s elder brother and co-emperor Valentinian I.

<doc id="260863" wikidata="Q1278677" url="?curid=260863" title="Henry Williamson">
<text>Henry William Williamson (1 December 1895 – 13 August 1977) was an English writer who wrote novels concerned with wildlife, English social history, ruralism and the First World War. He was awarded the Hawthornden Prize for literature in 1928 for his book &quot;Tarka the Otter&quot;.

He was born in London, and brought up in a semi-rural area where he developed his love of nature, and nature writing. He fought in the First World War and, having witnessed the Christmas truce and the devastation of trench warfare, he developed first a pacifist ideology, then fascist sympathies. He moved to Devon after the Second World War and took up farming and writing; he wrote many other novels. He married twice. He died in a hospice in Ealing in 1977, and was buried in North Devon.

==Early years==
Henry Williamson was born in Brockley in south-east London to bank clerk William Leopold Williamson (1865-1946) and Gertrude Eliza (1867-1936; née Leaver). In early childhood his family moved to Ladywell, and he received a grammar school education at Colfe&#x27;s School. The then semi-rural location provided easy access to the Kent countryside, and he developed a deep love of nature throughout his childhood.

==First World War==
On 22 January 1914, Williamson volunteered as a rifleman with the 5th (City of London) Battalion of the London Regiment, part of the British Army&#x27;s Territorial Force, and was mobilised when war was declared upon Imperial Germany on 5 August 1914.

In November 1914, he went to France with the London Rifle Brigade&#x27;s 1st Battalion, entering the Western Front&#x27;s trenches in the Ypres Salient, where he witnessed the Christmas Truce between British and German troops. In January 1915, he was withdrawn from the winter trenches with trench foot and dysentery and evacuated back to Britain. After convalescence, he was commissioned on 10 April 1915 as a second lieutenant with the 10th (Service) Battalion of the Bedfordshire Regiment. In May 1915, he was attached for training to the 2/1st Cambridgeshire Regiment at Newmarket. In October 1915, he was transferred to the 25th Middlesex Regiment at Hornchurch. He volunteered to specialise in machine-gun warfare, and in January 1916, joined No. 208 Machine Gun Company of the Machine Gun Corps at Belton Park, Grantham. In May 1916, he entered hospital in London with anaemia, and was granted two months&#x27; medical leave. He rejoined No. 208 MGC and in February 1917 departed Britain with it for the Western Front, the unit taking the field with the 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division. Williamson acted as his company&#x27;s transport officer and, in June 1917, he was gassed while transporting ammunition up to the front line. He was returned to the UK, spending the next few months in military convalescent hospitals. In September 1917, he was attached for garrison duty as the adjutant of the 3rd Bedfordshire Regiment at Felixstowe. Classed B1 by an Army Medical Board, from the effects of the gas, he was judged to be unfit for active service. After a year at Felixstowe, and frustrated at the nature of garrison life, Williamson attempted to get back to front-line action in September 1918 with an application to be transferred to the Royal Air Force, but this was rejected due to his medical classification. He then applied for a transfer to the Indian Army, which was granted, but the war was ending and the order was cancelled. He spent a year afterwards on administrative duties demobilising soldiers from military camps on the south east coast of England, and was discharged from the army himself on 19 September 1919.

Williamson became disgusted with what he considered to be the pointlessness of the war, blaming its causation on greed and bigotry. He became determined that Germany and Britain should never go to war again. Williamson was also powerfully influenced by the camaraderie that he had experienced in the trenches, and what he saw as the bonds of kinship that existed between the ordinary British and German soldiers.

==Early writing==
He told of his war experiences in &quot;The Wet Flanders Plain&quot; (1929), &quot;The Patriot&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1930) and in many of his books in the semi-autobiographical 15-book series &quot;A Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight&quot; (1951–1969).

After the war, he read Richard Jefferies&#x27; book &quot;The Story of My Heart&quot; and this inspired him to begin writing seriously. In 1921, he moved to Georgeham, Devon, initially living in Skirr Cottage there. He married Ida Loetitia Hibbert in 1925; they had six children. One daughter, Margaret, was the first wife of the guitarist and lutenist Julian Bream.
In 1927, Williamson published his most acclaimed book, &quot;Tarka the Otter&quot;; it won him the Hawthornden Prize in 1928, and made him enough money to pay for the wooden hut near Georgeham where he wrote many of his later books, often sitting alone there for 15 hours a day. The wooden writing hut was granted Grade II listed status by English Heritage in July 2014 because of its &quot;historical interest&quot;. &quot;Tarka&quot; also sparked a friendship with T. E. Lawrence who had similar views about the need for a lasting peace settlement in Europe. Williamson was in the process of attempting to set up a meeting between Lawrence and Adolf Hitler when Lawrence was killed in a motorcycle accident. Lawrence died in May 1935 shortly after receiving a telegram from Williamson, which has sparked some conspiracy theories. Williamson had developed a profound admiration for Hitler, whom he called &quot;the only true pacificist in Europe&quot;, and believed that the key for peace in Europe was giving leadership to the veterans of the Great War. In a letter to the editor of &quot;Time and Tide&quot; in May 1936, Williamson called Hitler &quot;a very wise and steadfast and truth-perceiving father of his people; a man like T.E. Lawrence, without personal ambitions, a vegetarian, non-smoker, non-drinker, without even a bank-balance&quot;. Williamson claimed on the Night of the Long Knives in 1934 that Hitler was &quot;actually in tears as he waited in the room&quot;, much like Lawrence &quot;when he had to shoot an Arab murderer with his own hands&quot;.

He developed the idea that &quot;politicians&quot; and &quot;pettifogging lawyers&quot; were standing in the way of peace, and all that was needed to prevent another world war was to arrange meetings between British and German veterans, who presumably would be able to settle all of the great questions of the day. Williamson wrote: &quot;The German ex-Service man respected the English ex-Service man. The English ex-Service man respected the German ex-Service man, and the German ex-Service men were in power in Germany&quot;. He devised the idea of a rally at the Royal Albert Hall in London to be attended by veterans from Britain, France and Germany, where Lawrence would have been the keynote speaker. He rather naively believed that such a rally would create an unstoppable movement for peace in Europe. Williamson had been very influenced by the Christmas truce of 1914, which led him to the idea that the British and German veterans had common values along with the elitist idea that the veterans constituted the natural ruling class of Europe. Like many other veterans, Williamson believed in the &quot;aristocracy of the trenches&quot;, believing that the men who fought in the war were an elite, men who were tougher, braver, and more hardier than anyone else along with being more honorable and noble. As the leadership of the National Socialist German Worker&#x27;s Party was almost entirely made up of veterans, he was strongly attracted to Nazism as an example of veterans in power. 

In 1936, he bought a farm in Stiffkey, Norfolk. &quot;The Story of a Norfolk Farm&quot; (1941) is his account of his first years of farming there.

==Politics==

In 1935, Williamson visited the National Socialist German Workers Party Congress at Nuremberg and was greatly impressed, particularly with the Hitler Youth movement, which he viewed as having a healthy outlook on life compared with the London slums. He had a &quot;well-known belief that Hitler was essentially a good man who wanted only to build a new and better Germany.&quot; Opposed to war and believing that wars were caused by Jewish &quot;usurial moneyed interests&quot;, he was attracted to Oswald Mosley&#x27;s British Union of Fascists and joined it in 1937. Mosley became Hereward Birkin in Williamson&#x27;s &quot;A Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight&quot; (possibly a reference to Hereward the Wake and Freda May Birkin, or possibly a reference to Chattie Wake who married Michel Hewitt Salaman who became master of the Exmoor Hunt 1908-11-see Piers P Read&#x27;s biography of Alec Guinness). During the Danzig crisis, Williamson believed if he could end the crisis peacefully by meeting Hitler as he wrote in August 1939: &quot;If I could see him, as a common soldier who had fraternised, on that faraway Christmas Day of 1914, with the men of his Linz battatlion under Messines Hill, might I not be able to give him the amity he so desired from England, a country he admired?&quot;

On the day of the British declaration of war, Williamson suggested to friends that he might fly to Germany to speak with Hitler to persuade him away from war. Following a meeting with Mosley later that day, however, he was dissuaded from his plan. At the start of the Second World War, Williamson was briefly held under Defence Regulation 18B for his political views. Williamson was very unpopular during the war for his pro-Nazi views, which made him into an outcast. Visiting London in January 1944, he observed with satisfaction that what he perceived as the ugliness and immorality represented by its financial and banking sector had been &quot;relieved a little by a catharsis of high explosive&quot; and somewhat &quot;purified by fire&quot;. In &quot;The Gale of the World&quot;, the last book of his &quot;Chronicle&quot;, published in 1969, Williamson has his main character Phillip Maddison question the moral and legal validity of the Nuremberg Trials.

Williamson initially retained a close relationship with Mosley in the immediate aftermath of the war, but when he brought Mosley as his guest to the Savage Club, the former BUF leader was asked to leave. Williamson refused Mosley&#x27;s invitation that he join the newly established Union Movement and indeed, his suggestion to Mosley that Mosley should instead join him in abandoning politics altogether led to the two men falling out. Nonetheless, Williamson would write for the Mosleys&#x27; theoretical journal &quot;The European&quot;. He also continued to express admiration after the war for aspects of Nazi Germany.

==Post-war life and writing==

After the war, the family left the farm. In 1946 Williamson went to live alone at Ox&#x27;s Cross, Georgeham in North Devon, where he built a small house in which to write. In 1947 Henry and Loetitia divorced. Williamson fell in love with a young teacher, Christine Duffield, and they were married in 1949. He began to write his series of fifteen novels collectively known as &quot;A Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight&quot;. In 1950, the year his only child by this marriage Harry Williamson was born, he edited a collection of poems and short stories by James Farrar, a promising young poet who had died, at the age of 20, in the Second World War. From 1951 to 1969 Williamson produced almost one novel a year while contributing regularly to the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; and &quot;The European&quot; magazine, edited by Diana Mosley. He also contributed a number of reviews and articles to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;.

In 1964 he had a short affair with the novelist Ann Quin, who was nearly forty years his junior (he had previously had an affair with his secretary Myfanwy Thomas, daughter of poet Edward Thomas). All this put great strain on his marriage and, in 1968, Christine and he were divorced after years of separation.

In 1974 he began working on a script for a film treatment of &quot;Tarka the Otter&quot;, but it was not regarded as suitable to film, being 400,000 words long. Filming went on, unbeknownst to him, and the film of &quot;Tarka the Otter&quot;, narrated by Peter Ustinov, was released in 1979.

==Death==

After a general anaesthetic for a minor operation, Williamson&#x27;s health failed catastrophically; one day he was walking and chopping wood, the next day he was unrecognisable and had forgotten who his family were. Suffering from dementia, he moved into a hospice at Twyford Abbey in Ealing. He died there on 13 August 1977, by coincidence on the day that the death scene of Tarka was being filmed. His body was buried in the graveyard of St George&#x27;s Church, Georgeham, North Devon. At a service of thanksgiving in St Martin-in-the-Fields, Ted Hughes delivered the memorial address.

==Henry Williamson Society==
The Henry Williamson Society was founded in 1980. His first wife, Loetitia, supported the society until her death in 1998 and his son, Richard, is its president.

<text>The Royal Fleet Auxiliary(RFA) is a naval auxiliary fleet owned by the UK&#x27;s Ministry of Defence. It is a component of His Majesty&#x27;s Naval Service and provides logistical and operational support to the Royal Navy and Royal Marines. 

The RFA ensures the Royal Navy is supplied and supported by providing fuel and stores through replenishment at sea, transporting Royal Marines and British Army personnel, providing medical care and transporting equipment and essentials around the world. In addition the RFA acts independently providing humanitarian aid, counter piracy and counter narcotic patrols together with assisting the Royal Navy in preventing conflict and securing international trade. They are a uniformed civilian branch of the Royal Navy staffed by British merchant sailors. 

The RFA is one of five RN fighting arms.

RFA personnel are civilian employees of the Ministry of Defence and members of the Royal Naval Reserve and Sponsored Reserves. Although RFA personnel wear Merchant Navy rank insignia with naval uniforms, they are personnel of the Royal Navy. RFA vessels are commanded and crewed by these sailors, augmented with regular and reserve Royal Navy personnel who perform specialised functions such as operating and maintaining helicopters or providing hospital facilities. Royal Navy personnel are also needed to operate certain weapons, such as the Phalanx; however, other weapons (such as the DS30B 30 mm cannon) are operated by RFA personnel. The RFA counts an aviation support vessel and dock landing ships amongst its assets.

As of late 2024, the RFA was suffering from severe manpower shortages resulting in only 6 of 11 vessels being able to be crewed on a regular basis.

==History==
The RFA was established in 1905 to provide logistical support for the Navy. Since the Royal Navy of that era possessed the largest network of bases around the world of any fleet, the RFA at first took a relatively minor role.

The RFA first became heavily relied upon by the Royal Navy during World War II, when the British fleet was often far from available bases, either due to the enemy capturing such bases, or, in the Pacific, because of the sheer distances involved. World War II also saw naval ships staying at sea for much longer periods than had been the case since the days of sail. Techniques of replenishment at sea (RAS) were developed. The auxiliary fleet comprised a diverse collection, with not only RFA ships, but also commissioned warships and merchantmen as well. The need for the fleet to be maintained was unambiguously demonstrated by World War II.

After 1945, the RFA became the Royal Navy&#x27;s main source of support in the many conflicts that the Navy was involved in. The RFA performed important service to the Far East Fleet off Korea from 1950 until 1953, when sustained carrier operations were again mounted in Pacific waters. During the extended operations of the Konfrontasi in the 1960s, the RFA was also heavily involved. As the network of British bases overseas shrank during the end of the Empire, the Navy increasingly relied on the RFA to supply its ships during routine deployments.

The RFA played an important role in the largest naval war since 1945, the Falklands War in 1982 (where one vessel was lost and another badly damaged), and also the Gulf War, Kosovo War, Afghanistan Campaign and the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

In July 2008, the RFA was presented with a Queen&#x27;s Colour, an honour unique to a civilian organisation.

==Fleet==
Ships in RFA service carry the ship prefix RFA, standing for Royal Fleet Auxiliary, and fly the Blue Ensign defaced with an upright gold killick anchor. All Royal Fleet Auxiliaries are built and maintained to Lloyd&#x27;s Register and Department for Transport standards.

As of 2024/25, there are 11 ships in service with the Royal Fleet Auxiliary with a total displacement of approximately 278,000 tonnes. These figures exclude the merchant navy vessels under charter to the Ministry of Defence performing sealift and fuel provisioning roles.

=== Underway replenishment ===

The most important role provided by the RFA is replenishment at sea (RAS), therefore the mainstay of the current RFA fleet are the replenishment ships. Two classes of vessel are in service as of 2024: and the .

The Tide class are designated &#x27;Fast Fleet Tankers&#x27; that were ordered in February 2012. The four tankers were ordered from DSME, South Korea with design support from Britain&#x27;s BMT Defence Services, the first of which entered service in 2017. From 2022, only the Tide class remained active with both of the former vessels placed in extended readiness (uncrewed reserve) and then, in 2024/25, retired from service completely. As of April 2024, RFA &quot;Tiderace&quot; was also reported to be in extended readiness, primarily owing to serious personnel shortages in the RFA. 

RFA &quot;Fort Victoria&quot; is a &#x27;one-stop&#x27; replenishment ship, capable of providing under way refuelling and dry cargo (i.e. rearming, victualling and spares). Until 2011, she had a sister ship in until she was decommissioned as a result of defence cuts. Two ships of the also provided dry stores replenishment but were placed into extended readiness in 2020. The two ships were later decommissioned, leaving &quot;Fort Victoria&quot; the only fleet solid support ship in service. In 2023, &quot;Fort Victoria&quot; was reported to be in &quot;reduced readiness&quot; and, in 2024, she was relegated to &quot;extended readiness&quot; (uncrewed reserve). A class of three new fleet solid support ships are expected to arrive starting in 2031 under the Fleet Solid Support Ship Programme. The manufacturing contract for this acquisition, valued at £1.6 billion, was signed in January 2023.

The Tide class and &quot;Fort Victoria&quot; incorporate aviation facilities, providing aviation support and training facilities as well as vertical replenishment capabilities. They are capable of operating and supporting Merlin and Lynx Wildcat helicopters, both of which are significant weapons platforms. The presence of aviation facilities on RFA ships allows for them to be used as &#x27;force multipliers&#x27; for the task groups they support in line with Royal Navy doctrine.

====Replenishment ships====


=== Amphibious warfare ===

From 2025, the RFA will be tasked with playing the lead role in providing amphibious shipping within the naval service, through its three dock landing ships (LSD). Typically one Bay-class vessel has also been assigned as a permanent &#x27;mothership&#x27; for Royal Navy mine countermeasures vessels in the Persian Gulf. However, crewing problems in the RFA have meant that the capacity to do this has eroded.

The 2021 defence white paper proposed the acquisition of a new class of up to six Multi-Role Support Ships (MRSS) to support littoral strike operations. These vessels are to replace the Bay-class ships, and other vessels, starting in the 2030s. In the interim, the white paper had proposed to upgrade one of the Bay-class vessels with permanent hangar facilities in order to carry out the littoral strike role. However, in July 2022 it was reported that the future littoral strike role would in fact be assumed by after a refit to convert her to this role.

&quot;Argus&quot; is a unique support ship in the RFA and has served in various aviation support roles. On active operations, she can deploy as a Primary Casualty Receiving Ship (PCRS); essentially a hospital ship. She cannot be described as such – and was not afforded such protection under the Geneva Convention – as she is armed. &quot;Argus&quot; completed a refit in May 2007 intended to extend her operational life to 2020. Prior to the announcement that she would take on the Littoral strike role, Defence Procurement Minister Jeremy Quin indicated that it was planned to retain the ship in service beyond 2030 rather than retiring her in 2024 as previously planned. The 2021 defence white paper did not specifically mention her replacement. However, Minister Quinn indicated that her functions are projected to be taken over by the new MRSS vessels, approved for acquisition in the 2021 defence white paper.

=== Ocean surveillance/survey ===

The RFA has acquired a Multi-Role Ocean Surveillance Ship to protect undersea critical national infrastructure, such as gas pipelines and undersea cables. In February 2023, the vessel identified for this role - MV &quot;Topaz Tangaroa&quot; - was acquired and in October 2023 entered service as RFA &quot;Proteus&quot;. She was purchased for some £70 million and was converted to act as a mothership for autonomous systems and have military communications and light defensive armament added.

It is reported that a second MROS ship is envisaged, which may be a new build vessel and, as of 2023, is in the concept stage. Service entry is envisaged likely in the early 2030s.

=== Mine countermeaures ===

In December 2022, it was reported that a commercial vessel was being sought for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary which would act as a trials vessel to further develop the concept of deploying autonomous minehunting systems from command and support motherships. The new vessel, to be named RFA Stirling Castle, is the former offshore support vessel MV &quot;Island Crown&quot; which, after her entry into service, is likely to be based at the Clyde naval base to operate with the Mine Threat and Exploitation Group which deploys the Royal Navy&#x27;s autonomous vessels. The ship was purchased for £40 million and arrived at HMNB Devonport in January 2023. Her conversion was not anticipated to be lengthy. Full service entry took place in April 2024.

Up to three additional ships, either new-build vessels or commercial conversions, are planned for eventual acquisition in the mine countermeasures command and support role.

====Mine Countermeasures Trials Platform====


=== Sealift and fuel provisioning ===

The s were acquired in 2002 under a £1.25bn private finance initiative with Foreland Shipping known as the Strategic Sealift Service. These ships are Merchant Navy vessels leased to the Ministry of Defence (MoD) as and when needed and as such are not part of the RFA. However, they are listed here due to their role in expeditionary military operations and in provisioning U.K. military bases and facilities. Originally six ships were part of the deal, allowing the MoD use of four of the ships with two being made available for commercial charter, these latter two were released from the contract in 2012.

The MoD also contracts to secure fuel supplies for facilities overseas. For sometime this requirement was maintained through charter of the vessel , then with the vessel &quot;Raleigh Fisher&quot; and most recently with the ship &quot;Leander Fisher&quot;. As of 2025, &quot;Leander Fisher&quot; is tasked with supplying fuel to the United Kingdom&#x27;s various naval establishments at home and overseas, as well as providing aviation fuel to RAF stations at Cyprus, Ascension Island and the Falkland Islands. The MoD has chartered the vessels to commercial companies during periods when not in use for defence purposes.

==Rank insignia==

===Officers===
Rank insignia of RFA officers differ from the Royal Navy as the RFA makes use of the diamond used by some British merchant shipping companies, rather than the executive curl used by the RN.
The rank of commodore is the most senior in the RFA.

Department Colours

The RFA uses distinction cloth to distinguish the branch of its officers. The Royal Navy ceased this practice for most officers in 1955, with the exception of medical and dental officers who are denoted by red and orange cloth respectively.

Although the Marine Engineering distinction cloth is generally described as being purple, it is in practice closer to maroon.

===Crew===

==Uniforms==
Officers and Ratings of the RFA wear similar uniforms to the regular navy with RFA distinguishing marks.

===No. 1 Dress===

This is the formal uniform worn on ceremonial occasions. For all officers it consists of a double-breasted, navy blue reefer jacket with four rows of two RFA buttons; matching trousers; white shirt and black tie; peaked cap; and black leather shoes. Rank insignia is denoted on the lower sleeve. RFA officer cap badges, although similar in style to those used by RN officers, feature a ring with letters &#x27;RFA&#x27; surrounding the fouled anchor at the centre.

For ratings below the rank of Petty Officer, this uniform is a single breasted tunic fastened with four RFA buttons, with flapped chest pockets and hip pockets; white shirt and black tie, and a dark blue beret and black leather shoes. Petty Officers and Chief Petty Officers wear a double breasted navy blue reefer jacket similar to the Officers version but with three rows of two RFA buttons. They wear a beret with an RFA badge, formerly a pantone blue, now the same colour as the RN Navy Blue. Rank insignia is denoted on the lower sleeve.

===No. 2 Dress===

Number 2A dress is the formal evening dress for ceremonial dinners; it consists of a navy blue mess jacket with a white waistcoat (black cummerbund for female officers) with miniature medals.
2B is &quot;mess undress&quot; for other mess functions, and is worn with either a black cummerbund or navy blue waistcoat and miniature medals. 2C, &quot;red sea rig&quot;, is worn for informal evening wear on board ship; it consists of a white short sleeved shirt, worn with shoulderboards, without medals and with black trousers, black shoes and a black cummerbund. It is unusual to see a black cummerbund worn with red sea rig as it is traditional to have personalised cummerbunds. These are usually in the branch colours of the wearer and commonly have either a branch insignia or a ship&#x27;s badge embroidered in the centre. This tradition is also prevalent in the RN.

===No. 3 Dress===
This is worn all year round for general duties. It consists of a white shirt with rank insignia on the shoulders, and appropriate headgear. For officers 3A dress includes a long-sleeved shirt and tie, while 3B includes a short-sleeved shirt worn with hard shoulder boards. 3C is the same in all respects as 3A but with the addition of a navy blue woollen jersey.
This is the same as for Officer&#x27;s No. 3 dress but with the relevant rate insignia and beret. Junior rates are only issued with short-sleeve shirts and are not issued with ties. Thus No.3 dress is divided into 3B (without jersey) and 3C dress (navy-blue jersey worn over the shirt with the shirt collar out). There is no equivalent of 3A dress for junior ratings.

===No. 4 Dress===
Number 4 dress is the working uniform of the RFA. It is referred to as Royal Fleet Auxiliary Personal Clothing System (RFAPCS); it consists of a navy blue fire-retardant jacket, navy blue baseball cap and beret, navy blue stable belt, navy-blue fire-retardant trousers, dms boots, black T-shirt and an optional navy-blue microfleece.
Number 4R dress is the same only without the jacket and with an optional baseball cap.
RFAPCS is distinguished from its RNPCS counterpart by the RFA blue ensign and &#x27;ROYAL FLEET AUXILIARY&#x27; tape replacing the white ensign and &#x27;ROYAL NAVY&#x27; tape worn on the left arm and left chest pocket respectively.
Junior ratings may also wear an RFA badged baseball cap in this order of dress, whilst undertaking courses at Royal Navy establishments.

===No. 5 Dress===
Number 5 dress is the collective category for all specialist working uniforms. They are worn as required for duties.

== Recruitment and training ==
As of 2022–23, the RFA was reported to be facing considerable recruiting challenges. Manpower was said to have dropped by 5 per cent from 2021 to 2022, contributing to the reduced availability, and even potential redundancy, of some vessels. In September 2024 RFA sailors began strike action over low pay. Due to compounding personnel shortages, even routine ship movements were curtailed.

The RFA recruits ratings either directly from industry (or where they are suitably trained to allow direct entry), or as apprentices whilst undertaking training.

Officers are recruited in one of three ways:
* direct from industry (or where they are suitably trained to allow direct entry)
* via the RTO (rating-to-officer) programme
* as cadets

All new officers take part in a 10-week Initial Naval Training Officers (INT-O) course at BRNC Dartmouth that is designed to familiarise new officers to the RFA and develop leadership skills.

<doc id="260870" wikidata="Q708913" url="?curid=260870" title="George Clymer">
<text>George Clymer (March 16, 1739January 23, 1813) was an American politician, abolitionist and Founding Father of the United States, one of only six founders who signed both the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution. Clymer was among the earliest patriots to advocate for complete independence from Britain. He attended the Continental Congress and served in political office until the end of his life. He was a Framer of the Constitution where he attempted unsuccessfully to regulate the importation of slaves. Clymer was himself a minor slave owner, at least briefly when seven years old through inheritance.

== Early life and family ==
Clymer was born in Philadelphia in the Province of Pennsylvania on March 16, 1739. Orphaned when only a year old, he was apprenticed to his maternal aunt and uncle, Hannah and William Coleman, to prepare to become a merchant. He married Elizabeth Meredith on March 22, 1765. In a letter written by Clymer to the rector of Christ Church, the Reverend Richard Peters, Clymer states that he had previously fathered a child; neither the child&#x27;s nor mother&#x27;s name is mentioned. Clymer and his wife had nine children, four of whom died in infancy. His oldest surviving son, Henry (born 1767), married the Philadelphia socialite Mary Willing in 1794. John Meredith, Margaret, George, and Ann also survived to adulthood, though John Meredith was killed in the Whiskey Rebellion in 1787 at age 18.

== Career ==
Clymer was a patriot and leader in the demonstrations in Philadelphia resulting from the Tea Act and the Stamp Act. Clymer accepted the command as a leader of a volunteer corps belonging to General John Cadwalader&#x27;s brigade. In 1759, he was inducted as a member of the original American Philosophical Society. He became a member of the Philadelphia Committee of Safety in 1773 and was elected to the Continental Congress 1776–1780. Clymer shared the responsibility of being treasurer of the Continental Congress with Michael Hillegas. He served on several committees during his first congressional term and was sent with Sampson Mathews to inspect the northern army at Fort Ticonderoga on behalf of Congress in the fall of 1776. When Congress fled Philadelphia in the face of Sir Henry Clinton&#x27;s threatened occupation, Clymer stayed behind with George Walton and Robert Morris. Clymer&#x27;s business ventures during and after war served to increase his wealth. In 1779 and 1780, Clymer and his son Meredith engaged in a lucrative trade with Sint Eustatius. Although not partial to the merchant business, Clymer continued in business with his father-in-law and brother-in-law until 1782.
He resigned from Congress in 1777 and in 1780 was elected to a seat in the Pennsylvania Legislature. In 1782, he was sent on a tour of the southern states in a vain attempt to get the legislatures to pay up on subscriptions due to the central government. He was re-elected to the Pennsylvania legislature in 1784 and represented his state at the Constitutional Convention in 1787. He was elected to the first U.S. Congress in 1789.

He was the first president of The Philadelphia Bank and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and vice-president of the Philadelphia Agricultural Society. When Congress passed a bill imposing a duty on spirits distilled in the United States in 1791, Clymer was placed as head of the excise department in the state of Pennsylvania. He was also one of the commissioners to negotiate a treaty with the Creek Indian confederacy at Colerain, Georgia on June 29, 1796. He is considered the benefactor of Indiana Borough, as it was he who donated the property for a county seat in Indiana County, Pennsylvania.

Clymer died on January 23, 1813. He was buried at the Friends Burying Ground in Trenton, New Jersey.

== Slavery ==
Clymer is known to have been a slave owner; to what degree is uncertain, although it is known his father, grandfather and brother were minor slave owners. When his father Christopher died, George, then seven years old, inherited &quot;a negro man named Ned&quot;, who died soon after. Ned was probably the only remains of an inheritance given to Christoper from his father, Richard, George&#x27;s grandfather, who owned four slaves.

Clymer, as a member of the Pennsylvania delegation during the framing of the Constitution, unsuccessfully opposed the slave trade. The question of the slave trade, i.e. the import of new slaves into the United States, was one of the most contentious issues for the framers. Clymer was on the committee to draft a Slave Trade Compromise to postpone the slave trade decision until 1808. Clymer supported an &quot;export tax&quot; (tariff), which was a way to indirectly tax slavery, and which like the slave trade question was opposed by southern states. Nevertheless, the tariff was included as part of the compromise.

== Legacy ==

USS &quot;George Clymer&quot; (APA-27) was named in his honor. Clymer, Indiana County, Pennsylvania, was named in his honor as was Clymer, New York. There is a George Clymer Elementary School in the School District of Philadelphia. Clymer&#x27;s home in Morrisville, Pennsylvania, known as Summerseat, still stands, as does a house he owned in Philadelphia&#x27;s Fairmount Park known as Ridgeland Mansion. One of the streets running alongside Summerseat in Morrisville is Clymer Avenue.

In Reading, Pennsylvania, Clymer Street is named in his honor. In the Leedom Estates section of Ridley Township, Pennsylvania, Clymer Lane is named after him.

Clymer Avenue in Indiana, Pennsylvania, is named after George Clymer.

<doc id="260871" wikidata="Q329870" url="?curid=260871" title="Abraham Clark">
<text>Abraham Clark (February 15, 1726 – September 15, 1794) was an American Founding Father, politician, and Revolutionary War figure. Clark was a delegate for New Jersey to the Continental Congress where he signed the Declaration of Independence and later served in the United States House of Representatives in both the Second and Third United States Congress, from March 4, 1791, until his death in 1794.

==Early life==
Clark was born in Elizabethtown in the Province of New Jersey. His father, Thomas Clark, realized that he had a natural grasp for math so he hired a tutor to teach Abraham surveying. While working as a surveyor, he taught himself law and went into practice. He became quite popular and became known as &quot;the poor man&#x27;s councilor&quot; as he offered to defend poor men who could not afford a lawyer. He was a slaveholder.

Clark married Sarah Hatfield circa 1749, with whom he had 10 children. While she raised the children on their farm, Clark was able to enter politics as a clerk of the Provincial Assembly. Later he became high sheriff of Essex County and in 1775 was elected to the Provincial Congress. He was a member of the Committee of Public Safety.

==Political career==
Early in 1776, the New Jersey delegation to the Continental Congress was opposed to independence from Great Britain. As the issue heated up, the state convention replaced all their delegates with those favoring the separation. Because Clark was highly vocal on his opinion that the colonies should have their independence, on June 21, 1776, they appointed him, along with John Hart, Francis Hopkinson, Richard Stockton, and John Witherspoon as new delegates. They arrived in Philadelphia on June 28, 1776, and voted for the Declaration of Independence in early July.

Clark remained in the Continental Congress through 1778, when he was elected as Essex County&#x27;s Member of the New Jersey Legislative Council. New Jersey returned him twice more, from 1780 to 1783 and from 1786 to 1788. Clark was one of New Jersey&#x27;s three representatives at the aborted Annapolis Convention of 1786, along with William C. Houston and James Schureman. In an October 12, 1804 letter to Noah Webster, James Madison recalled that Clark was the delegate who formally motioned for the Constitutional Convention, because New Jersey&#x27;s instructions allowed for consideration of non-commercial matters.

Clark, more than many of his contemporaries, was a proponent of democracy and the common man, supporting especially the societal roles of farmers and mechanics. Because of their emphasis on production, Clark saw these occupations as the lifeblood of a virtuous society, and he decried the creditor status of more elite men, usually lawyers, ministers, physicians, and merchants, as an aristocratic threat to the future of republican government. Unlike many Founding Fathers who demanded deference to elected officials, Clark encouraged constituents to petition their representatives when they deemed change necessary.

In May 1786, Clark, aided by thousands of petitions in the preceding months, pushed a pro-debtor paper money bill through the New Jersey legislature. To garner support for the paper money bill and espouse his populist vision for New Jersey&#x27;s future, Clark, under the pseudonym &quot;A Fellow Citizen,&quot; published a forty-page pamphlet entitled &quot;The True Policy of New-Jersey, Defined; or, Our Great Strength led to Exertion, in the Improvement of Agriculture and Manufactures, by Altering the Mode of Taxation, and by the Emission of Money on Loan, in IX Sections&quot; in February 1786.

Clark unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 1788, but was later elected to the House in 1791, where he served until his death.

==Death and legacy==
Clark retired before the state&#x27;s Constitutional Convention in 1794. He died from sunstroke at his home. Clark Township in Union County, New Jersey, is named for him, as is Abraham Clark High School in Roselle, New Jersey. Clark is buried there at the Rahway Cemetery in Rahway, New Jersey.

<doc id="260872" wikidata="Q285521" url="?curid=260872" title="Samuel Chase">
<text>Samuel Chase (April 17, 1741 – June 19, 1811) was a Founding Father of the United States, signer of the Continental Association and United States Declaration of Independence as a representative of Maryland, and Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. In 1804, Chase was impeached by the House of Representatives on grounds of letting his partisan leanings affect his court decisions, but was acquitted the following year by the Senate and remained in office. He is the only United States Supreme Court Justice to have ever been impeached.

Born near Princess Anne, Maryland, Chase established a legal practice in Annapolis, Maryland. He served in the Maryland General Assembly for several years and favored independence during the American Revolution. He won election to the Continental Congress before serving on the Baltimore District Criminal Court and the Maryland General Court. In 1796, President George Washington appointed Chase to the United States Supreme Court.

After the 1800 elections, President Thomas Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans sought to weaken Federalist influence on the federal courts. Chase&#x27;s actions on the court had been accused of demonstrating bias, and Jefferson believed that Chase should be removed from office, a process that required a vote in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The House passed eight articles of impeachment, all centering on Chase&#x27;s alleged political bias. The Senate voted to acquit Chase on all counts, and Chase served on the Supreme Court until his death in 1811. Some historians have argued that Chase&#x27;s acquittal set an important precedent regarding the independence of the federal judiciary.

==Early life==

Samuel Chase was the son of the Reverend Thomas Chase (c. 1703–1779) and his wife, Matilda Walker (1705–1741), born near Princess Anne, Maryland. His father was a clergyman who immigrated to Somerset County to become a priest in a new church. Samuel was educated at home. He was eighteen when he left for Annapolis where he studied law under attorney John Hall. He was admitted to the bar in 1761 and started a law practice in Annapolis. It was during his time as a member of the bar that his colleagues gave him the nickname of &quot;Old Bacon Face&quot;, either due to his proneness for a facial flush when angered or excited or due to his general ruddy complexion in general, or both.

In May 1762, Chase married Anne Baldwin, daughter of Thomas and Agnes Baldwin. Samuel and Anne had three sons and four daughters, with only four surviving to adulthood. Anne died in 1776. In 1784, Chase traveled to England to deal with Maryland&#x27;s Bank of England stock, where he met Hannah Kilty, daughter of Samuel Giles, a Berkshire physician. They were married later that year and had two daughters, Hannah and Elisa.

Chase was a slaver who owned 15 enslaved people at his death.

==Political career==
In 1762, Chase was expelled from the Forensic Club, an Annapolis debating society, for &quot;extremely irregular and indecent&quot; behavior. In 1764, Chase was elected to the Maryland General Assembly where he served for 20 years. 

In 1766, he became embroiled in a war of words with a number of loyalist members of the Maryland political establishment. In an open letter dated July 18, 1766, Chase attacked Walter Dulany, George Steuart (1700–1784), John Brice (1705–1766), and others for publishing an article in the &quot;Maryland Gazette Extraordinary&quot; of June 19, 1766, in which Chase was accused of being: &quot;a busy, reckless incendiary, a ringleader of mobs, a foul-mouthed and inflaming son of discord and faction, a common disturber of the public tranquility&quot;. In his response, Chase accused Steuart and the others of &quot;vanity...pride and arrogance&quot;, and of being brought to power by &quot;proprietary influence, court favour, and the wealth and influence of the tools and favourites who infest this city.&quot;

In 1769, he started construction of the mansion that would become known as the Chase–Lloyd House, which he sold unfinished in 1771. The house is now a National Historic Landmark. He co-founded Anne Arundel County&#x27;s Sons of Liberty chapter with his close friend William Paca, as well as leading opposition to the 1765 Stamp Act.

From 1774 to 1776, Chase was a member of the Annapolis Convention. He served on Maryland&#x27;s Council of Safety in 1775. He represented Maryland at the Continental Congress, was re-elected in 1776 and signed the United States Declaration of Independence. He remained in the Continental Congress until 1778. Chase was elected to the 1788 Maryland Ratifying Convention to ratify the proposed 1787 Constitution. In the Convention, Chase was a prominent Antifederalist, though despite his efforts Maryland became the seventh state to ratify.

==Judicial career==
In 1786, Chase moved to Baltimore, which remained his home for the rest of his life. In 1788, he was appointed chief justice of the District Criminal Court in Baltimore and served until 1796. In 1791, he became Chief Justice of the Maryland General Court, again serving until 1796. On January 26, 1796, President George Washington nominated Chase as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States; the U.S. Senate confirmed his appointment the following day. Chase was sworn into office on February 4, 1796, and served on the Court until his death on June 19, 1811.

===Impeachment===
President Thomas Jefferson, alarmed at the seizure of power by the judiciary through the claim of exclusive judicial review, led his party&#x27;s efforts to remove the Federalists from the bench. His allies in Congress had, shortly after his inauguration, repealed the Judiciary Act of 1801, abolishing the lower courts created by the legislation and terminating their Federalist judges despite lifetime appointments; Chase, two years after the repeal in May 1803, had denounced it in his charge to a Baltimore grand jury, saying that it would &quot;take away all security for property and personal liberty, and our Republican constitution will sink into a mobocracy.&quot; Earlier in April 1800, Chase, acting as a district judge, had made strong attacks upon Thomas Cooper, who had been indicted under the Alien and Sedition Acts; Chase had taken the air of a prosecutor rather than a judge. Also in 1800, when a grand jury in New Castle, Delaware declined to indict a local printer, Chase refused to discharge them, saying he was aware of one specific printer whom he wished them to indict for seditious behavior. Jefferson saw the attack as indubitable bad behavior and an opportunity to reduce the Federalist influence on the judiciary by impeaching Chase, launching the process from the White House when he wrote to Congressman Joseph Hopper Nicholson of Maryland, asking: &quot;Ought the seditious and official attack [by Chase] on the principles of our Constitution . . .to go unpunished?&quot;

On March 12, 1804, the House voted 73 to 32 to impeach Chase. The House of Representatives voted on December 4, 1804 to adopt eight articles of impeachment, one of which involved Chase&#x27;s handling of the trial of John Fries. Two more focused on his conduct in the political libel trial of James Callender. One article covered Chase&#x27;s conduct with the New Castle grand jury, charging that he &quot;did descend from the dignity of a judge and stoop to the level of an informer by refusing to discharge the grand jury, although entreated by several of the said jury so to do.&quot; Three articles focused on procedural errors made during Chase&#x27;s adjudication of various matters, and an eighth was directed at his &quot;intemperate and inflammatory … peculiarly indecent and unbecoming … highly unwarrantable … highly indecent&quot; remarks while &quot;charging&quot; or authorizing a Baltimore grand jury. The United States Senate—controlled by the Jeffersonian Democratic-Republicans—began the impeachment trial of Chase on February 9, 1805, with Vice President Aaron Burr presiding and Virginia Representative John Randolph leading the prosecution.

All the counts involved Chase&#x27;s work as a trial judge in lower circuit courts. (In that era, Supreme Court justices had the added duty of serving as individuals on circuit courts, a practice that was ended in the late 19th century.) The heart of the allegations was that political bias had led Chase to treat defendants and their counsel in a blatantly unfair manner. Chase&#x27;s defense lawyers called the prosecution a political effort by his Republican enemies. In answer to the articles of impeachment, Chase argued that all of his actions had been motivated by adherence to precedent, judicial duty to restrain advocates from improper statements of law, and considerations of judicial efficiency.

The Senate voted to acquit Chase of all charges on March 1, 1805. There were 34 senators present (25 Democratic-Republicans and 9 Federalists), and 23 votes were needed to reach the required two-thirds majority for conviction/removal from office. Of the eight votes taken, the closest vote was 18 for conviction/removal from office and 16 for acquittal in regards to the Baltimore grand jury charge. He is the only U.S. Supreme Court justice to have been impeached. Judge Alexander Pope Humphrey recorded in the &quot;Virginia Law Register&quot; an account of the impeachment trial and acquittal of Chase.

The impeachment raised constitutional questions over the nature of the judiciary and was an important point in series of efforts to define the appropriate extent of &quot;judicial independence&quot; in America, especially with regard to the Supreme court and Constitution. It set de facto limits on the impeachment power, fixed the concept that the judiciary was prohibited from openly engaging in partisan politics in the same way, defined the role of the judge in a criminal jury trial, and clarified judicial &quot;independence&quot;. The construction was largely attitudinal, as it modified political norms without their explicit codification.

The acquittal of Chase—by lopsided margins on several counts—set an unofficial precedent that many historians say helped ensure the so-called independence of the judiciary. As Chief Justice William Rehnquist noted in his book &quot;Grand Inquests&quot;, some senators declined to convict Chase despite their partisan hostility to him, apparently because they doubted that the mere &quot;quality&quot; of his judging was grounds for removal. All impeachments of federal judges since Chase have been based on allegations of legal or ethical misconduct, not on judicial performance. For their part, federal judges were generally much more cautious than Chase in trying to avoid the appearance of political partisanship.

==Death and legacy==
Samuel Chase died of a heart attack in 1811. He was interred in what is now Baltimore&#x27;s Old Saint Paul&#x27;s Cemetery. The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

<text>Carter Braxton (September 10, 1736October 10, 1797) was a Founding Father of the United States, signer of the Declaration of Independence, merchant, and Virginia planter. A grandson of Robert &quot;King&quot; Carter, one of the wealthiest and most powerful landowners and slaveholders in Virginia, Braxton was active in Virginia&#x27;s legislature for more than 25 years, generally allied with Landon Carter, Benjamin Harrison V, Edmund Pendleton and other conservative planters.

==Early life==

Braxton was born on Newington Plantation in King and Queen County, Virginia, on September 10, 1736, but wrongly reported as dead along with his mother, Mary Carter Braxton, who &quot;unhappily catching a Common Cold,&quot; died shortly after his birth.

His maternal grandfather, King Carter, possibly the wealthiest man as well as the largest landowner in Virginia at the time of his death, had bequeathed £2,000 to his youngest daughter, who became betrothed to George Braxton Jr. five months after her father&#x27;s death (although her brother had not paid that full amount to her new husband by the time of her death). His paternal grandfather, George Braxton, Sr. by 1704 (before western lands were opened to European settlement) had also become one of the 100 largest landowners in Virginia&#x27;s Northern Neck. His grandfather first won election to the House of Burgesses in 1718 and was re-elected many times, in 1728 alongside John Robinson, Jr., who would become the powerful Speaker of the House of Burgesses and benefactor of the Braxton family. The elder Braxton owned at least one ship, the &quot;Braxton&quot; that traded with the West Indies and elsewhere, and was commission agent for cargoes of enslaved blacks sold to Virginia planters. He died, aged 71, when Carter was twelve; his eldest son (Carter&#x27;s father) George Jr. had succeeded him as delegate for King and Queen County in 1742 but died not long thereafter in 1749. Speaker Robinson and neighbor Humphrey Hill served as guardians for Carter and his slightly (3 year) elder brother George (who inherited Newington and various land in King and Queen and Essex County).

Educated at the College of William &amp; Mary like his father and brother, Braxton followed family tradition at age 19 by marrying Judith Robinson, a wealthy heiress and the Speaker&#x27;s niece. However, she died giving birth to their daughter, leaving Braxton two daughters, Mary and Judith. The young widower soon journeyed to England for two years, where like his elder brother he gained a reputation for extravagance. Upon returning to the colonies in 1760, Braxton bought Chericoke plantation (near Elsing Green, where he had lived with Judith and would ultimately die), to which he moved, married again and built a manor house in 1767. His second wife, Elizabeth Corbin, was the eldest daughter of Richard Corbin, deputy receiver general for his majesty&#x27;s revenues in Virginia, and brought a £1000 dowry.

==Career as merchant and plantation owner ==

Braxton&#x27;s elder brother died in October 1761, so Braxton inherited the rest of his grandfather&#x27;s estate, which was by then burdened with significant debts so that creditors persuaded some land to be sold, but even after doing so Braxton owned more than 12,000 acres and about 165 slaves in the 1770s. Braxton purchased a small schooner shortly after his second marriage and like his father turned his energies to trade. Braxton traded between the West Indies and American colonies, establishing relationships with Bayard &amp; Son of New York and Willing &amp; Morris of Philadelphia. He also urged the Brown brothers of Providence, Rhode Island, who had abandoned the slave trade during the French and Indian War, to sell him African people, but such transactions may not have completed. Whether or not Braxton&#x27;s mercantile enterprises included slave trading, he and his brother were accompanied by a black slave at the College of William &amp; Mary.

Braxton later owned many more slaves on his various plantations which extended westward into those leased by tenant farmers in Amherst County. No records indicate any manumissions; nor does his will survive. At the end of the Revolutionary War, despite selling off some properties after his father&#x27;s and brother&#x27;s deaths and for his own debts, Braxton owned at least 12,000 acres and 165 slaves. Land poor at the conflict&#x27;s end, six years later he owned about 8500 acres. Before his death, Braxton sold off or gave to his kinsmen all but 42 of his slaves and probably could only have farmed fewer than half of the remaining 3,900 acres. Braxton&#x27;s racial attitudes, while common to his class, contrasted with those of another of King Carter&#x27;s grandsons, Robert Carter III, and of George Mason IV, who fought against the slave trade during their legislative careers. Most persons with the name Carter Braxton since the end of the Civil War have been, and are, African-American, presumably descendants of slaves on Braxton&#x27;s plantations.

==Early political career==

Braxton began his long career representing King William County in the Virginia House of Burgesses, taking his seat in 1761. However, his brother George died on October 3, 1761, leaving an insolvent estate, so the family lost Newington (which burned down, under other owners, in 1800). Although both high-living Braxtons had been considered wealthy, as well as political allies of Speaker John Robinson, when the John Robinson estate scandal broke in 1766, they turned out to be among the largest beneficiaries of the late speaker&#x27;s interest-free loans of redeemed paper money supposed to have been burned.

In addition to his duties as a Burgess, Braxton served as sheriff of King William County (a lucrative position for which he briefly resigned his position as Burgess), colonel of its militia, and vestryman of the troubled St. John&#x27;s Church about ten miles east of his Chericoke plantation. Factional disputes within the parish (which assessed members to support not only the rector but the parish poor) grew so severe that the House of Burgesses held hearings and ultimately passed a special bill dissolving the vestry, as Braxton had wished.

Although always considered a moderate or conservative politician, Braxton signed the First Virginia Association intended to protest the Townshend duties on tea and other products, but like his ally Landon Carter, not the Second Association which set up boycott compliance mechanism, nor the Third Virginia Association pledging not to purchase various East Indian commodities. However, in 1774 Braxton returned to Williamsburg as King William County&#x27;s delegate (with William Aylett), and joined 108 others in the Fourth Virginia Association, which authorized local committees of safety as well as volunteer militia. When Lord Dunmore seized the colony&#x27;s gunpowder and flintlocks for their rifles, Braxton helped negotiate a compromise between fellow legislator Patrick Henry and his own father-in-law Corbin that averted a crisis.

==Reluctant revolutionary and Virginia moderate==

Braxton was &quot;a moderate politician during the Revolution—often viewed as sympathetic to the British (but not a Loyalist).&quot; Although absent at some sessions, he had represented his county sixteen times between 1761 and Lord Dunmore&#x27;s dissolution of the House of Burgesses; Braxton also served as the county delegate to all five sessions of the Virginia Convention. In 1774, Braxton joined the patriots&#x27; Committee of Safety in Virginia, as well as chaired the legislative committee considering legal penalties for Tories.

When Peyton Randolph died unexpectedly in Philadelphia in October 1775, fellow Virginia legislators elected Braxton to take his place in the Continental Congress. He served in the Congress from February 1776 until August, when Virginia reduced its delegation to five members. In that capacity Braxton signed the Declaration of Independence, although he had previously opposed it as premature in Committee of the Whole, and explained his stance in several letters to his uncle Landon Carter. Braxton also drew revolutionaries&#x27; criticism for his pamphlet, &quot;Address to the Convention&quot;, which he had printed in reply to the proposals of John Adams&#x27;s &quot;Thoughts on Government&quot;.

Afterwards Braxton returned to the House of Burgesses, which thanked him and Thomas Jefferson for their service, although King William voters failed to re-elect the absent Braxton as one of their delegates (so he missed the two sessions in 1778). Moreover, his house at Chericoke burned down shortly before Christmas in 1776, so Braxton moved his family to Grove House near West Point, Virginia. Through most of his legislative career, Braxton was a political opponent of the Lee family (since its involvement in the Robinson estate scandal), and he also became involved in a press quarrel with anti-slavery activist and diplomat Arthur Lee, supposedly concerning Silas Deane&#x27;s mercantile and diplomatic activities. Between 1776 and 1785, Braxton served in 8 of the 11 legislative assemblies and attended 14 of 21 sessions, with a special concern for debt and tax moratoriums or other relief.

==Financial speculation and troubles==

Braxton invested a great deal of his wealth in the American Revolution. Like Robert Morris, Braxton loaned money to the cause, as well as funded shipping and privateering (and lost about half of the 14 ships in which he held interests). Braxton (with fellow businessmen including Morris and Benjamin Harrison) sold Virginia and Carolina tobacco and corned meat abroad, and secured arms and ammunition (unsuccessfully, most colonies preferring arms supplied by foreign governments on favorable terms), as well as wheat and salt, and cloth and other trade goods. In 1780, the Continental Congress censured Braxton for his role in the &quot;Phoenix&quot; affair of 1777, in which his privateer seized a neutral Portuguese vessel from Brazil, prompting diplomatic protests. The British also destroyed some of Braxton&#x27;s plantations during the war.

In addition to the indebtedness incurred after the deaths of his father and brother, and through his own relatively poor agricultural business practices, Braxton accumulated war debts from the Continental Congress and also of Robert Morris, both of which proved slow to repay. In 1786 Braxton sold a plantation and rented a smaller residence (&quot;row-house&quot;) in Richmond, which (with the depreciated paper currency) allowed him to repay his own indebtedness to the Robinson estate in 1787.

In 1787, Braxton sued Robert Morris in Henrico County court for £28,257, but the lawsuit continued for eight years before commissioners were appointed, then Morris appealed. Finally, Virginia&#x27;s Court of Appeals led by Edmund Pendleton decided mostly in favor of Braxton before Morris was forced into bankruptcy by his own continued land speculations (although Morris as late as 1800 believed he should have won £20,000). In 1791, Braxton also purchased Strawberry Hill outside Richmond for his wife (who had received nothing upon her father&#x27;s death, all his property being given to his sons), and conveyed it to his sons Carter Jr. and Corbin to hold for their mother&#x27;s benefit. Braxton&#x27;s biographer does not believe that Braxton hid assets from his creditors by placing them in relatives&#x27; names, although his widow later attempted to recover dower rights in land and slaves that her husband sold in his last years. His sons-in-law, Robert Page and John White (husbands of Molly and Judith, his daughters by his first wife) paid creditors more than £2,000 on Braxton&#x27;s behalf.

On November 15, 1785, fellow delegates elected Braxton to the Council of State (which handled the executive functions formerly performed by the Privy Council). Receiving the paid position vacated by William Nelson, Jr., Braxton moved to Richmond, which had become the capital in 1780. Ineligible for re-election for three years, Braxton was elected a second time in 1794.

== Death and legacy ==
Braxton died, aged 61, in his Richmond home on October 10, 1797. Family tradition maintains Henrico County sheriff Samuel Mosby was at Braxton&#x27;s door attempting to collect debts lest he have to pay them himself. His widow survived until July 5, 1814, and was praised in an obituary for the assistance and comfort she had offered Braxton during his final years (during which he suffered two or more strokes during Council meetings).

A biographer speculated that Braxton may be the Founding Father with the most descendants, since he and his second wife may have had as many as sixteen children, in addition to his two daughters with his first wife. Although none of Braxton&#x27;s sons (George, Corbin, Carter Jr., John Tayloe, William) lived as long as their father, they and their sisters had numerous children, many of whom fought for the Confederate Army during the American Civil War, including grandsons (all achieving the rank of Major) Carter Moore Braxton of the Fredericksburg Artillery, Tomlinson Braxton, M.D. and Elliott Muse Braxton (who was later elected to the Forty-second Congress and served from March 4, 1871 – March 3, 1873). Confederate General Braxton Bragg was named for the signer, but not apparently a descendant. Another great-grandson, John W. Stevenson of Kentucky, served two terms as U.S. Representative before the Civil War, and later won election as governor in 1868 and U.S. Senator in 1871, before retiring to his law practice and becoming president of the American Bar Association. Virginia lawyer Allen Caperton Braxton, who led efforts to limit blacks&#x27; access to education and voting, particularly during Virginia&#x27;s Constitutional Convention in 1902, proclaimed his descent from Carter Braxton.

Carter Braxton may have been buried at Chericoke, which remains in the family&#x27;s possession today. Although it burned in 1776, Braxton rebuilt it and gave it to his eldest son George on his marriage to Mary Walker Carter (daughter of Charles Carter of Shirley) in 1781 (which transfer survived despite legal attacks by his creditors). However, when the family graves there were moved to Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond in 1910, his could not be located; a monument was erected for him nonetheless. Nearby Elsing Green also survives and is available for tourism.

Braxton County, West Virginia, was named in his honor. The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor. For a brief time during the 1960s to the early 1980s, the Waterman Steamship Company owned a break bulk freighter, SS &quot;Carter Braxton&quot;, which was named in his honor. The Newington Archaeological Site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.

<text>William Ellery (December 22, 1727 – February 15, 1820) was a Founding Father of the United States, one of the 56 signers of the United States Declaration of Independence, and a signer of the Articles of Confederation as a representative of Rhode Island.

In 1764, the Baptists consulted with Ellery and Congregationalist Reverend Ezra Stiles on writing a charter for the college that became Brown University. Ellery and Stiles attempted to give control of the college to the Congregationalists, but the Baptists withdrew the petition until it was rewritten to assure Baptist control. Neither Ellery nor Stiles accepted appointment to the reserved Congregationalist seats on the board of trustees.

==Biography==
Ellery was born in Rhode Island on December 22, 1727, the second son of William Ellery Sr. and Elizabeth Almy, a descendant of Thomas Cornell. He received his early education from his father, a merchant and Harvard College graduate. He graduated from Harvard College in 1747, where he excelled in Greek and Latin. He then returned to Newport where he worked first as a merchant, next as a customs collector, and then as clerk of the Rhode Island General Assembly. He started practicing law in 1770 at age 43 and became active in the Rhode Island Sons of Liberty.

Statesman Samuel Ward died in 1776, and Ellery replaced him in the Continental Congress. He was a signer of the Articles of Confederation and one of the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. The size of his signature on the Declaration is second only to John Hancock&#x27;s famous signature.

Ellery also served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island from May 1780 to May 1781, and chief justice from June 1785 to May 1786. He had become an abolitionist by 1785. He was the first customs collector of the port of Newport under the Constitution, serving there until his death, and he worshipped at the Second Congregational Church of Newport.

Ellery died on February 15, 1820, at age 92 and was buried in Common Burial Ground in Newport. The Rhode Island Society of the Sons of the Revolution and the William Ellery Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution make an annual commemoration at his grave on Independence Day.

==Family and legacy==
Ellery married Ann Remington of Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1750. She was the daughter of Judge Jonathan Remington. She died in 1764 in Cambridge and was buried there, and he married Abigail Cary in 1767. He had 19 children, and his descendants include Ellery Channing, Washington Allston, William Ellery Channing, Richard Henry Dana Sr., Edie Sedgwick, Paulita Sedgwick, Kyra Sedgwick and Andra Akers. Francis Dana married his daughter Elizabeth. His great-great-grandnephew, Major Elbert Ellery Anderson (1833–1903), took his middle name from him.

Ellery left a humorous record of his travels (on a mount he refers to as &quot;my Jenny&quot;) from Massachusetts to Philadelphia in 1778 and 1779 that was published in serial form in the &quot;Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography&quot; of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania (1887).

William Ellery is the namesake of the town of Ellery, New York, and Ellery Avenue in Middletown, Rhode Island, is named in his honor

<doc id="260876" wikidata="Q1381060" url="?curid=260876" title="William Floyd">
<text>William Floyd (December 17, 1734 – August 4, 1821) was an American Founding Father, wealthy farmer, and political leader from New York. Floyd served as a delegate to the Continental Congress and was a signer of the Continental Association and Declaration of Independence. In August 1776, a few weeks after the Declaration was signed, British forces defeated an American army at the battle of Long Island and confiscated Floyd&#x27;s house and estate, using the property as a base for their cavalry units over the next seven years. Floyd remained active in politics throughout the Revolutionary Era, served as a major general in the New York State militia, and was elected to the first U.S. Congress in 1789.

==Early life==
Floyd was born on December 17, 1734, in Brookhaven, Province of New York, on Long Island into a family of English and Welsh origins. He was the son of Tabitha (née Smith) Floyd and Nicoll Floyd (1705–1755). Among his siblings was sister Ruth Floyd, who married Brigadier General Nathaniel Woodhull; sister Charity Floyd, who married Continental Congressmen Ezra L&#x27;Hommedieu; and brother Charles Floyd, who married Margaret Thomas in 1761.

William&#x27;s great-grandfather was Richard Floyd, who was born in Brecknockshire, Wales, in about 1620 and was the last of his brothers to leave England, first visiting Jamestown, Virginia, before settling in the Province of New York around 1640 where he practiced law. Around 1688, his grandfather purchased 4,400 acres from Tangier Smith&#x27;s family in the Mastic Neck of the Town of Brookhaven. William&#x27;s father Nicoll built a house there in 1723 where William was born.

==Career==
After his father&#x27;s death in 1755, William took over the family farm. He became a member of the Suffolk County Militia in the early stages of the American Revolutionary War, becoming Major General. He was a delegate from New York to the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1776. He was a member of the New York State Senate (Southern District) from 1777 to 1788.

On July 4, 1787, he was elected an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati. In March 1789, he was elected to the 1st United States Congress under the new Constitution as an Anti-Administration candidate and served until March 3, 1791. Floyd was a presidential elector in 1792, voting for George Washington and George Clinton. Floyd, for whom the town of Floyd, New York, is named, became a resident of Oneida County in 1794.

In 1795, Floyd ran for Lieutenant Governor of New York with Robert Yates on the Democratic-Republican ticket, but they were defeated by Federalists John Jay and Stephen Van Rensselaer. Floyd was again a presidential elector in 1800, voting for Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr; and in 1804, voting for Jefferson and George Clinton. Floyd was a member of the state senate (Western District) in 1808.

In 1820, Floyd was chosen a presidential elector but did not attend the meeting of the electoral college, and Martin Van Buren was appointed to fill the vacancy. In the 1820 Census, when Floyd was 86, he had 6 slaves and 2 free black residents lived in his household at the General William Floyd House in Westernville, New York.

==Personal life==

=== Family ===
The 1760, Floyd was married to Hannah Jones (1740–1781), who was born in Southampton, New York, and was the daughter of William Jones. Together, they were the parents of:

* Nicoll Floyd (1762–1852), who married Phoebe Gelston (1770–1836), daughter of David Gelston (collector of the Port of New York), in 1789.
* Mary Floyd (1764–1805), who married Colonel Benjamin Tallmadge, who was in charge of President George Washington&#x27;s spy ring.
* Catherine Floyd (1767–1832), who married Reverend William Clarkson (1763–1812).

After the death of his first wife in 1781, Floyd remarried to Joanna Strong (1747–1826), who was born in Setauket, New York, and was the daughter of Benajah Strong and Martha (née Mills) Strong. Together, they were the parents of:

* Ann Floyd (1785–1857), who married George Washington Clinton (1771–1809), son of George Clinton, the first Governor of New York and the fourth Vice President of the United States.
* Elizabeth Floyd (1789–1820), who married James Platt (1788–1870), youngest son of Continental Congressmen Zephaniah Platt.

===Residence and estate===

The William Floyd House, the family home, is located in Mastic Beach, is part of Fire Island National Seashore and is open to visitors. It consists of the home, grounds and a cemetery of the Floyd family. Over the course of 200 years, eight generations of Floyds have managed the 25-room mansion and 613-acre property. Prior to the 20th century, the estate was much larger.

===Descendants===
Through his son Nicoll, he was a grandfather of U.S. Representative John Gelston Floyd, and Mary Floyd, who married John Lawrence Ireland (grandson of New York State Senator Jonathan Lawrence). Through his daughter Catherine, he was the grandfather of Harriet Ashton (née Clarkson) Crosby (1786–1859), and great-grandfather of New York State Senator Clarkson Floyd Crosby, who married Angelica Schuyler, daughter of John Schuyler.

==Death and legacy==
Floyd died on August 4, 1821, and is buried at the Westernville Cemetery in Oneida County. His widow died in 1826.

There are several places named after William Floyd, including:

* William Floyd School District in present-day Brookhaven Town, which includes William Floyd Elementary, William Floyd middle school, and William Floyd High School.
* William Floyd Parkway in the Town of Brookhaven.
* Town of Floyd in Oneida County.
* General William Floyd Elementary School in the Holland Patent School District in Oneida County

<text>Button Gwinnett ( ; March 3, 1735 – May 19, 1777) was a British-born American Founding Father who, as a representative of Georgia to the Continental Congress, was one of the signers (first signature on the left) of the United States Declaration of Independence. Gwinnett was also, briefly, the provisional president of Georgia in 1777, and Gwinnett County (now a major suburb of metropolitan Atlanta) was named for him. He was named in honor of his mother’s cousin, Barbara Button, who became his godmother. Gwinnett was killed in a duel by rival Lachlan McIntosh following a dispute after a failed invasion of East Florida.

==Early life and education==

Gwinnett was born in 1735 in the parish of Down Hatherley in the county of Gloucestershire, England, to a Welsh father, the Reverend Samuel Gwinnett, (Gwinnett deriving from the Welsh kingdom of Gwynedd) and his wife, Anne. He was the third of his parents&#x27; seven children, born after his older sister Anna Maria and his older brother Samuel. There are conflicting reports as to his exact birthdate, but he was baptized in St Catherine&#x27;s Church in Gloucester on April 10, 1735. It is believed that he attended the College School, held in Gloucester Cathedral (now called The King&#x27;s School) as did his older brother, but there is no surviving evidence to substantiate this. He started his career apprenticed to his uncle William Gwinnett, a greengrocer in Gloucester, then moved to Wolverhampton in Staffordshire in 1754 after obtaining a further apprenticeship with an ironmonger there named John Weston Smith. On 19 April 1757 he married Ann Bourne, daughter of a greengrocer, at St. Peter&#x27;s Church, Wolverhampton. In 1762, the couple, who parented three daughters, departed Wolverhampton and emigrated to America.

Gwinnett&#x27;s business activities took him from Newfoundland to Jamaica. Never very successful, he moved to Savannah, Georgia, in 1765, and opened a store. When that venture failed, he bought (on credit) St. Catherine&#x27;s Island, as well as a large number of slaves, in order to attempt to become a planter. Though his planting activities were also unsuccessful, he did make a name for himself in local politics and was elected to the Provincial Assembly.

==Political career==
Gwinnett did not become a strong advocate of colonial rights until 1775, when St. John&#x27;s Parish, which encompassed his lands, threatened to secede from Georgia because of the colony&#x27;s conservative response to the events of the times. During his tenure in the Assembly, Gwinnett&#x27;s chief rival was Lachlan McIntosh, and Lyman Hall was his closest ally.

Gwinnett was appointed to represent Georgia at the Continental Congress, where he voted in favor of the Declaration of Independence, adopted by Congress on July 2, 1776. He signed the famous parchment copy on August 2, 1776. After signing the Declaration, he was accompanied as far as Virginia by Carter Braxton, another of the signers, carrying a proposed state constitution drawn up by John Adams. During his service in the Continental Congress, Gwinnett was a candidate for a brigadier general position to lead the 1st Regiment in the Continental Army but lost out to McIntosh. The loss of the position to his rival embittered Gwinnett greatly.

Gwinnett served in the Georgia state legislature, and in 1777 he wrote the original draft of Georgia&#x27;s first state constitution. He became Speaker of the Georgia Assembly, a position he held until the death of the President (Governor) of Georgia Archibald Bulloch. Gwinnett was elevated to the vacated position by the Assembly&#x27;s Executive Council. In this position, he sought to undermine the leadership of McIntosh. Tensions between Gwinnett and McIntosh reached a boiling point when the General Assembly voted to approve Gwinnett&#x27;s attack on British Florida in April 1777.

==Death==
As acting Delegate of the Congress from Georgia and commander-in-chief of Georgia&#x27;s military, Gwinnett was the superior of his rival McIntosh. Gwinnett had McIntosh&#x27;s brother arrested and charged with treason. He also ordered McIntosh to lead an invasion of British-controlled East Florida, which failed. Gwinnett and McIntosh blamed each other for the defeat, and McIntosh publicly called Gwinnett &quot;a scoundrel and lying rascal&quot;. Gwinnett then challenged McIntosh to a duel, which they fought on May 16, 1777, at a plantation owned by deposed Royal Governor James Wright. The two men exchanged pistol shots at twelve paces, and both were wounded. Gwinnett died of his wounds on May 19, 1777, and is believed to have been buried in Savannah&#x27;s Colonial Park Cemetery. McIntosh, although wounded, recovered and went on to live until 1806. He was not charged in connection with Gwinnett&#x27;s death.

==Legacy==
Gwinnett&#x27;s autograph is highly sought by collectors as a result of a combination of the desire by many top collectors to acquire a complete set of autographs by all 56 signers of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, and the extreme rarity of the Gwinnett signature; there are 51 known examples, since Gwinnett was fairly obscure prior to signing the Declaration and died shortly afterward. Only ten of those are in private hands. A letter containing his signature sold for a record $51,000 in 1927; a record that stood for over 45 years. In 1979, a record $100,000 was paid for a receipt signed by Gwinnett.

Gwinnett County, Georgia, a suburban county outside Atlanta, is named after him and he is one of the three Georgia signers of the Declaration of Independence honored with the Signers Monument in Augusta.

SS &quot;Button Gwinnett&quot; was a Liberty ship launched 2 May 1943 and scrapped in 1968.

==References in popular culture==
The 1953 Isaac Asimov short story &quot;Button, Button&quot; concerns an attempt to obtain a genuine (and therefore valuable) signature of Gwinnett by means of a device that can move objects through time.

The sale of a document containing Gwinnett&#x27;s signature was part of the plot in a 1971 &quot;Mannix&quot; episode, &quot;A Button for General D.&quot;

During a media tour to promote his musical, &quot;Hamilton&quot;, Lin-Manuel Miranda performed a parody musical called “Button!” on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;. In it, Stephen Colbert plays Gwinnett as he engages in a rap battle with John Adams (played by Miranda).

===&quot;Fallout&quot; series===
The 2008 action role-playing game &quot;Fallout 3&quot; features a powdered wig-wearing robot inside the National Archives Building that believes itself to be Button Gwinnett, guarding the Declaration of Independence. In the side quest &quot;Stealing Independence&quot;, the player can either take the declaration, optionally destroying the robot in the process, or help it and forge a copy.

The 2015 sequel, &quot;Fallout 4&quot;, features a Boston-based beer company called the &quot;Button Gwinnett Brewery&quot; and its front of house restaurant, &quot;The Gwinnett Restaurant&quot;. The company&#x27;s founder, a local brewer named Button Gwinnett, is named after the respective founding father. In game, the player can consume one of the brewery&#x27;s products, Gwinnett stout alcohol, and find the brewery in the South Boston neighborhood.

<doc id="260879" wikidata="Q49123" url="?curid=260879" title="Harvard College">
<text>Harvard College is the undergraduate college of Harvard University, a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. Part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard College is Harvard University&#x27;s traditional undergraduate program, offering AB (Bachelor of Arts) and SB (Bachelor of Science) degrees. It is highly selective, with fewer than four percent of applicants being offered admission as of 2022. 

Harvard College students participate in over 450 extracurricular organizations and nearly all live on campus. First-year students reside in or near Harvard Yard and upperclass students reside in other on-campus housing.

==History==


Harvard College was founded in 1636 by vote of the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Two years later, the college became home to North America&#x27;s first known printing press, carried by the ship . In 1639 the college (heretofore unnamed) was named Harvard College in honor of deceased Charlestown minister John Harvard (1607–1638) who had bequeathed to the school his entire library and half of his monetary estate.

Harvard&#x27;s first Headmaster was Nathaniel Eaton (1610–1674); in 1639, he also became its first instructor to be dismissed, for overstrict discipline. The school&#x27;s first students were graduated in 1642.

The Harvard Indian College was established, with the capacity for four or five Native Americans, and in 1665 Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck (–1666) &quot;from the Wampanoag … did graduate from Harvard, the first Indian to do so in the colonial period.&quot;

The University of Oxford and University of Cambridge, two of the oldest and most prestigious universities in the English-speaking world, have long been structured with individual colleges as part of the larger university and with each college including an association of scholars that shared room and board. Harvard&#x27;s founders may have envisioned it as the first in a series of sibling colleges replicating the Oxford and Cambridge model, which would eventually constitute a university, though no further colleges materialized in colonial era. The Indian College was active from 1640 to no later than 1693, but it was a minor addition not operated in federation with Harvard according to the English model. Harvard began granting higher degrees in the late eighteenth century, and it was increasingly styled Harvard University, even as Harvard College was increasingly thought of as the university&#x27;s undergraduate division in particular.

Harvard College is currently responsible for undergraduate admissions, advising, housing, student life, athletics, and other undergraduate matters except instruction, which is the purview of the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The body known as the President and Fellows of Harvard College retains its traditional name despite having governance of the entire university. Radcliffe College, established in 1879, originally paid Harvard faculty to repeat their lectures for women.
Since the 1970s, Harvard has been responsible for undergraduate matters for women, though women&#x27;s Harvard diplomas were countersigned by the President of Radcliffe until a final merger in 1999.

== Admissions ==
Admission is based on academic prowess, extracurricular activities, and personal qualities. For the undergraduate class of 2025, Harvard had 57,435 applications and accepted 1,968 (3.4% acceptance rate). For the undergraduate class of 2023, the middle 50% range of SAT scores of enrolled freshmen was 710–770 for reading and writing and 750–800 for math, while the middle 50% range of the ACT composite score was 33–35. The average high school grade point average (GPA) was 4.18. The acceptance rate for transfer students has been approximately 1%. Harvard consistently ranks first in the enrollment of recipients of the National Merit $2,500 Scholarship; it enrolled 207 such scholars in the Class of 2022.

Harvard College ended its early admissions program in 2007, but for the class of 2016 and beyond, an early action program was reintroduced.
The freshman class that entered in the fall of 2017 was the first to be majority (50.8%) nonwhite.

A federal lawsuit alleges that Harvard&#x27;s admissions policies discriminate against Asian Americans, who tend to be overrepresented among students with high academic achievement.

A 2019 district court decision in the case (which has since been appealed) found no evidence of explicit racial bias but did not rule out a small amount of implicit bias. Harvard has implemented more implicit bias training for its admissions staff in accordance with the court&#x27;s recommendations. In addition, Harvard&#x27;s admissions preference for children of alumni, employees, and donors has been criticized as favoring white and wealthy candidates.

The median family income of Harvard students is $168,800, with 53% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 20% from the bottom 60%.

As of 2024, Harvard College tuition was about $57,000 and total costs about $83,000. However, Harvard offers one of the most generous financial aid programs in the United States, with need-blind admission and 100% of financial need met for all students. Families with incomes below $85,000 pay nothing for their children to attend, while families earning up to $150,000 pay no more than 10% of their annual incomes. Financial aid is solely based on need; no merit or athletic scholarships are offered.

==Academics==
The four-year, full-time undergraduate program has a liberal arts and sciences focus. To graduate in the usual four years, undergraduates normally take four courses per semester.

Midway through the second year, most undergraduates join one of fifty academic majors; many also declare a minor (secondary field). Joint majors (combining the requirements of two majors) and special majors (of the student&#x27;s own design) are also possible.
Most majors lead to the &quot;Artium Baccalaureus&quot; (AB). Some award the &quot;Scientiae Baccalaureus&quot; (SB). There are also dual degree programs permitting students to earn both a Harvard AB and a Master of Music (MM) from either the New England Conservatory of Music or the Berklee College of Music over five years.

In most majors, an honors degree requires advanced coursework and/or a senior thesis.

Harvard College students must take a course in each of four General Education categories (Aesthetics and Culture; Ethics and Civics; Histories, Societies, Individuals; Science and Technology in Society) as well as a course in each of three academic divisions (Arts and Humanities; Social Sciences; Science and Engineering and Applied Science). They must also fulfill foreign language, expository writing, and quantitative reasoning with data requirements. Exposure to a range of intellectual areas in parallel with pursuit of a chosen major in depth fulfills the injunction of former Harvard president Abbott Lawrence Lowell that liberal education should produce &quot;men who know a little of everything and something well&quot;.

Some introductory courses have large enrollments, but most courses are small: the median class size is 12 students. Funding and faculty mentorship for research is available in all disciplines for undergraduates at all levels.

== Student life ==
===House system===


Nearly all undergraduates live on campus, for the first year in dormitories in or near Harvard Yard and later in the upperclass houses—administrative subdivisions of the college as well as living quarters, providing a sense of community in what might otherwise be a socially incohesive and administratively daunting university environment. Each house is presided over by two faculty deans, while its Allston Burr Resident Dean—usually a junior faculty member—supervises undergraduates&#x27; day-to-day academic and disciplinary well-being.

The faculty deans and resident dean are assisted by other members of the Senior Common Room—select graduate students (tutors), faculty, and university officials brought into voluntary association with each house. The faculty deans and resident dean reside in the house, as do resident tutors. Terms like tutor, Senior Common Room, and Junior Common Room reflect a debt to the constituent college systems at Oxford and Cambridge from which Harvard&#x27;s system took inspiration.

The houses were created by President Lowell in the 1930s to combat what he saw as pernicious social stratification engendered by the private, off-campus living arrangements of many undergraduates at that time. Lowell&#x27;s solution was to provide every man—Harvard was male-only at the time—with on-campus accommodations throughout his time at the college; Lowell also saw great benefits in other features of the house system, such as the relaxed discussions—academic or otherwise—which he hoped would take place among undergraduates and members of the Senior Common Room over meals in each house&#x27;s dining hall.

How students come to live in particular houses has changed greatly over time. Under the original &quot;draft&quot; system, masters (now called &quot;faculty deans&quot;) negotiated privately over the assignment of students. From the 1960s to the mid-1990s, each student ranked the houses according to personal preference, with a lottery resolving the oversubscription of more popular houses. Today, groups of one to eight freshmen form a block which is then assigned, essentially at random, to an upperclass house.

The nine &quot;River Houses&quot; are south of Harvard Yard, near the Charles River: Adams, Dunster, Eliot, Kirkland, Leverett, Lowell, Mather, Quincy, and Winthrop. Their construction was financed largely by a 1928 gift from Yale alumnus Edward Harkness, who, frustrated in his attempts to initiate a similar project at his alma mater, eventually offered $11 million to Harvard.

Construction of the first houses began in 1929, but the land on which they were built had been assembled decades before. After graduating from Harvard in 1895, Edward W. Forbes found himself inspired by the Oxford and Cambridge systems during two years of study in England; on returning to the United States he set out to acquire the land between Harvard Yard and the Charles River that was not already owned by Harvard or an associated entity. By 1918, that ambition had been largely fulfilled and the assembled land transferred to Harvard.

The three Quad Houses enjoy a residential setting half a mile northwest of Harvard Yard. These were built by Radcliffe College and housed Radcliffe College students until the Harvard and Radcliffe residential systems merged in 1977. They comprise Cabot, Currier, and Pforzheimer House. A thirteenth house, Dudley Community, formerly called Dudley House, is nonresidential but fulfills the administrative and social functions provided to on-campus residents by the other twelve houses for undergraduate students living in the Dudley Co-op, many of the undergraduate students living off-campus (which are small in number), and the Visiting Undergraduate Students who study at Harvard for a term or year. Harvard&#x27;s residential houses are paired with Yale&#x27;s residential colleges in sister relationships.

=== Student government ===
The Harvard Undergraduate Council (UC) was the student government of Harvard College until it was abolished by a student referendum in 2022. It was replaced by the Harvard Undergraduate Association (HUA). 

=== Athletics ===


The Harvard Crimson fields 42 intercollegiate sports teams in the NCAA Division I Ivy League, more than any other NCAA Division I college in the country. Every two years, the Harvard and Yale track and field teams come together to compete against a combined Oxford and Cambridge team in the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world. As with other Ivy League universities, Harvard does not offer athletic scholarships.

Harvard&#x27;s athletic rivalry with Yale is intense in every sport in which they meet, coming to a climax each fall in the annual football meeting, which dates back to 1875 and is usually called simply &quot;The Game&quot;. While Harvard&#x27;s football team is no longer one of the best as it was in football&#x27;s early days, both Harvard and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In 1903, Harvard Stadium introduced a new era into football with the first permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country.

Even older than HarvardYale football rivalry, the Harvard–Yale Regatta is held each June on the Thames River in eastern Connecticut. The Harvard crew is typically considered to be one of the top teams in the country in rowing. Other sports in which Harvard teams are particularly strong are men&#x27;s ice hockey, squash, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s fencing. Harvard&#x27;s men&#x27;s ice hockey team won the school&#x27;s first NCAA Championship in any team sport in 1989, and Harvard also won the Intercollegiate Sailing Association National Championships in 2003. Harvard was the first Ivy League school to win an NCAA Championship in a women&#x27;s sport when its women&#x27;s lacrosse team won in 1990.

The school color is crimson, which is also the name of Harvard&#x27;s sports teams and the student newspaper, &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;. The color was unofficially adopted (in preference to magenta) by an 1875 vote of the student body, although the association with some form of red can be traced back to 1858, when Charles William Eliot, a young graduate student who would later become Harvard&#x27;s 21st and longest-serving president (1869–1909), bought red bandanas for his crew so they could more easily be distinguished by spectators at a regatta.

==== Fight songs ====
Harvard has several fight songs, the most played of which, especially at football, are &quot;Ten Thousand Men of Harvard&quot; and &quot;Harvardiana&quot;. While &quot;Fair Harvard&quot; is actually the alma mater, &quot;Ten Thousand Men&quot; is better known outside the university. The Harvard University Band performs these fight songs and other cheers at football and hockey games. These were parodied by Harvard alumnus Tom Lehrer in his song &quot;Fight Fiercely, Harvard&quot;, which he composed while an undergraduate.

====Athletics history====
By the late 19th century, critics of intercollegiate athletics, including Harvard president Charles William Eliot, believed that sports had become over-commercialized and took students away from their studies. They called for limitations on all sports. This opposition prompted Harvard&#x27;s athletic committee to target &quot;minor&quot; sports—basketball and hockey—for reform in order to deflect attention from the major sports: football, baseball, track, and crew. The committee made it difficult for the basketball team to operate by denying financial assistance and limiting the number of overnight away games in which the team could participate.

=== Student organizations ===

Harvard has more than 450 undergraduate student organizations.
The Phillips Brooks House Association acts as an umbrella service organization.

<text>The Nomad rover is an uncrewed vehicle designed as a test for such a vehicle to ride on other planets.

From June 15 to July 31 of 1997 on a mission, Carnegie Mellon University deployed the robotic rover Nomad to traverse the Atacama Desert of Northern Chile. Nomad traveled an unprecedented 215 km in 45 days, remotely controlled and driven from both the Kamin Science Center in Pittsburgh, PA, and the Intelligent Mechanisms Group laboratory at Ames Research Center (ARC). This NASA-funded research program tested technologies critical to planetary exploration and enabled scientists to perform remote geological experiments. The total cost of developing Nomad and conducting the desert trek was $1.6 million.

Nomad was operated entirely under remote control from the U.S., including telepresence and autonomous guidance with simulated 4- to 15-minute time delays such as those that would be encountered on missions to Mars. 20 of the 215 km it travelled were done under autonomous control. The distance was travelled in 45 days.

Nomad is about the size of a small car and has a mass of 550 kg. To maneuver through rough terrain, the robot has four-wheel drive and four-wheel steering with a chassis that expands to improve stability and travel over various terrain conditions. Four aluminum wheels with cleats provide traction in soft sand. For this terrestrial experiment, power was supplied by a gasoline generator that enabled the robot to travel at speeds up to about one mile per hour. Nomad employed a panospheric camera, a high-resolution video camera that focuses up into a hemispheric mirror similar to a store security mirror. The video view includes all of the ground up to the horizon in the circle surrounding Nomad. The robot also had three pairs of conventional stereo cameras and a laser rangefinder for 3D visualization.

Today, Nomad is on display at the Museo del Desierto de Atacama (Atacama Desert Museum) in Antofagasta, Chile.

<text>Antirrhinum is a genus of plants in the Plantaginaceae family, commonly known as dragon flowers or snapdragons because of the flowers&#x27; fancied resemblance to the face of a dragon that opens and closes its mouth when laterally squeezed. They are also sometimes called toadflax or dog flower. They are native to rocky areas of Europe, the United States, Canada, and North Africa. &quot;Antirrhinum&quot; species are widely used as ornamental plants in borders and as cut flowers.

== Description ==
The &quot;Antirrhinum&quot; is morphologically diverse, particularly the New World group (&quot;Saerorhinum&quot;). The genus is characterized by personate flowers with an inferior gibbous corolla.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Antirrhinum&quot; used to be treated within the family Scrophulariaceae, but studies of DNA sequences have led to its inclusion in a vastly enlarged family Plantaginaceae, within the tribe Antirrhineae.

=== Circumscription ===
The taxonomy of this genus is complex and not yet fully resolved at present. In particular the exact circumscription of the genus, especially the inclusion of the New World species (&quot;Saerorhinum&quot;), is contentious. The situation is further complicated by the variety of terms in use for infrageneric ranks, especially of the Old World species, that is &quot;Antirrhinum&quot;, &quot;sensu stricto&quot; (e.g. Streptosepalum, Kicksiella, Meonantha).

The USDA Plants Database recognises only two species: &quot;A. majus&quot; (the garden snapdragon), the only species naturalised in North America, and &quot;A. bellidifolium&quot; (the lilac snapdragon), now considered to be &quot;Anarrhinum bellidifolium&quot; (L.) Willd. There are 23 accepted species.

A widely accepted scheme (Thompson 1988) placed 36 species in the genus in three sections. While many botanists accepted this broad circumscription (&quot;sensu lato&quot;), whose main departure from other classifications was the inclusion of the New World Saerorhinum, others did not, restricting the genus to the Old World. (For a comparison of Thompson with earlier systems, see Oyama and Baum, Table 1.) New species also continue to be discovered (see e.g. Romo &quot;et al.&quot;, 1995).

In 2004 research into the molecular systematics of this group and related species by Oyama and Baum confirmed that the genus &quot;sensu lato&quot; as described by Thompson is monophyletic, provided that one species (&quot;A. cyathiferum&quot;) is removed to the separate genus &quot;Pseudorontium&quot;, and the two species of &quot;Mohavea&quot; (&quot;Mohavea confertiflora&quot; and &quot;M. breviflora&quot;) are included. The species list given here follows these conclusions.

This is the broad circumscription that includes the Old World&quot; Misopates&quot; and New World &quot;Sairocarpus&quot;. By contrast the narrow circumscription (&quot;sensu stricto&quot;) confines the genus to the monophyletic Old World perennial species with a diploid chromosome number of 16, distributed in the Mediterranean basin, approximately 25 species., following the phylogenetic analysis of Vargas &quot;et al.&quot; (2004) suggesting they are a distinct group. Both &quot;Misopates&quot; and &quot;Sairocarpus&quot; are accepted names in &quot;The Plant List&quot;, and many of the New World species now have &quot;Sairocarpus&quot; as their accepted name, rather than &quot;Antirrhinum&quot;. It has been proposed that many of the New World &quot;Antirrhinum&quot; be now considered under &quot;Sairocarpus&quot;, in the forthcoming &quot;Flora of North America&quot;.

=== Infrageneric subdivision ===
It is widely agreed that this broad group should be subdivided into three or four subgroups, but the level at which this should be done, and exactly which species should be grouped together, remain unclear. Some authors continue to follow Thompson in using a large genus &quot;Antirrhinum&quot;, which is then divided into several sections; others treat Thompson&#x27;s genus as a tribe or subtribe, and divide it into several genera. For a comparison of earlier schemes see Mateu-Andrés and de Paco, Table 1 (2005)

If the broad circumscription is accepted, its three sections as described by Thompson are as follows (two Old World, one New):

*Section &quot;Antirrhinum&quot;: 19 Old World species of relatively large flowered perennial plants, including the type species &quot;Antirrhinum majus&quot;, mostly native to the western Mediterranean region with a focus on the Iberian Peninsula. Chromosomes n=8. (3 subsections: &quot;Majora&quot;, &quot;Sicula&quot;, &quot;Hispanica&quot;)
*Section &quot;Orontium&quot;: two species, also from the Mediterranean. Chromosome number=8. The species in this section, including the section type species &quot;Antirrhinum orontium&quot; (lesser snapdragon) are often treated in the genus &quot;Misopates&quot;.
*Section &quot;Saerorhinum&quot;: 15 small flowered New World species, mostly annual plants and mostly native to California, though species are found from Oregon to Baja California Sur and as far east as Utah. Tetraploid (n=15-16). Like other authors, Thompson placed &quot;A. cyathiferum&quot; in this section, but Oyama and Baum, following earlier authors, suggest that it should be reclassified in genus &quot;Pseudorontium&quot;, while &quot;Mohavea&quot; should be included. Vargas &quot;et al.&quot;, strongly recommending segregation of the New World species suggest that the 14 species originally recognised by Sutton (1988) more properly belong to &quot;Sairocarpus&quot; (11 species), &quot;Howelliella&quot; (1 species), and &quot;Neogarrhinum&quot; (2 species). Other authors would also include &quot;Galvezia glabrata&quot;, &quot;Galvezia juncea&quot;, &quot;Galvezia rupicola&quot; and &quot;Galvezia speciosa&quot;. None of the names originally allocated to this section are now accepted.

=== Snapdragons ===
While &quot;Antirrhinum majus&quot; is the plant that is usually meant by the term of &quot;snapdragon&quot; if used on its own, many other species in the genus, and in the family Scrophulariaceae more widely, have common names that include the word &quot;snapdragon&quot;. For example, &quot;Antirrhinum molle&quot; is known as &quot;dwarf snapdragon&quot; in the UK.

=== Species ===
The following species are recognised in the genus &quot;Antirrhinum&quot;:
*&quot;Antirrhinum australe&quot; 
*&quot;Antirrhinum barrelieri&quot; 
*&quot;Antirrhinum × bilbilitanum&quot;

*&quot;Antirrhinum siculum&quot; 
*&quot;Antirrhinum tortuosum&quot; 
*&quot;Antirrhinum valentinum&quot; 
=== Etymology ===
The name &quot;Antirrhinum&quot; is derived from the Greek &quot;antirrhinon&quot; which in turn is derived from &quot;anti&quot; &quot;opposite, counterfeiting&quot;, and &quot;rhis&quot; &quot;nose&quot; ( &quot;rhinos&quot;); from its resemblance to an animal&#x27;s mouth.

== Ecology ==
Snapdragons are short-lived perennial plants that survive well in cold seasons but are often replanted each spring and considered annual plants. They do best in full or partial sun, in well-drained soil since their roots are susceptible to rotting (although they do require regular watering). They are classified commercially as a range of heights: &quot;midget&quot; or &quot;dwarf&quot; (), &quot;medium&quot; () and &quot;tall&quot; (). Removing the dead flowers, referred to as deadheading, is important to help them to continuously produce beautiful flowers throughout their growing season. They are susceptible to ethylene gas, so removing dead flowers and keeping them away from ripe fruits or vegetables also helps them bloom longer. They grow during their peak seasons of April to June and August to October in the Northern Hemisphere and bloom in a variety of colors such as white, yellow, orange, red, purple, pink, including multicolored patterns.

They are ecologically diverse, particularly the New World species (&quot;Saerorhinum&quot;).

== Cultivation ==
The snapdragon is an important garden plant, widely cultivated from tropical to temperate zones as a bedding, rockery, herbaceous border or container plant. Cultivars have showy white, crimson, or yellow bilabiate flowers (with two lips). It is also important as a model organism in botanical research, and its genome has been studied in detail.

=== Genetic studies ===
&quot;Antirrhinum&quot; is a genus that has been used from the earliest genetic studies of Gregor Mendel and Charles Darwin and was used as a model by Erwin Baur. Together with closely related genera, it has become a model organism for the investigation of the genetic basis of plant development, particularly floral development.
The genus is a typical example of incomplete dominance by the red allele with the anthocyanin pigment. Any cross between red-flowered and white-flowered snapdragons, give an intermediate and heterozygous phenotype with pink flowers, that carries both the dominant and recessive alleles.

Several species of &quot;Antirrhinum&quot; are self-incompatible, meaning that a plant cannot be fertilised by its own pollen. Self-incompatibility in the genus has been studied since the early 1900s. Self-incompatibility in &quot;Antirrhinum&quot; species is controlled gametophytically and shares many important features with self-incompatibility systems in Rosaceae and Solanaceae.

== Uses ==
In addition to growing the plants for cut flowers, the seeds have been used to extract edible oils, particularly in Russia, while the leaves and flowers have been considered to possess antiphlogistic (anti-inflammatory) properties and have been used in poultices. A green dye has also been extracted from the flowers.

<doc id="260897" wikidata="Q731813" url="?curid=260897" title="Oliver Wolcott">
<text>Oliver Wolcott Sr. ( ; November 20, 1726 December 1, 1797) was an American Founding Father and politician. He was a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation as a representative of Connecticut, and the nineteenth governor of Connecticut. Wolcott was a major general for the Connecticut militia in the Revolutionary War serving under George Washington.

==Early life==

Wolcott was born in Windsor, Connecticut, the youngest of 10 children born to colonial Governor Roger Wolcott and Sarah Drake Wolcott. His elder brother was Erastus Wolcott. He attended Yale College, graduating in 1747 as the top scholar in his class. Upon graduation, New York Governor George Clinton granted Wolcott a captain&#x27;s commission to raise a militia company to fight in the French and Indian Wars (King George&#x27;s War (1744–1748)). Captain Wolcott served on the northern frontier defending the Canadian border against the French until the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle of 1748. He then moved to newly settled Goshen in northwestern Connecticut to practice and study medicine with his brother Alexander. He then moved to Litchfield and became a merchant; he was appointed sheriff of the newly created Litchfield County, Connecticut, serving from 1751 to 1771. He married Lorraine (Laura) Collins of Guilford, Connecticut, on January 21, 1755. They had five children: Oliver (who died young), Oliver Jr., Laura, Mariann, and 

===American Revolutionary War===
Wolcott had two careers during the war years as one of Connecticut&#x27;s principal delegates to the Continental Congress and also a militia officer. He participated in the American Revolutionary War as brigadier general and then as major general in the Connecticut militia. As a representative in the Continental Congress, he was a strong advocate for independence.

Early in the growing struggle with Great Britain, Wolcott made it clear that the colonists would not give up their rights and privileges. In February 1776, he stated: &quot;Our difference with Great Britain has become very great. What matters will issue in, I cannot say, but perhaps in a total disseverance from Great Britain.&quot; The early support for independence led him to important roles during the war, both as military leader and as member of the Continental Congress.

Wolcott saw extensive militia service during the American Revolution. On August 11, 1776, Connecticut officials ordered him to march the Seventeenth Regiment of militia to New York and join George Washington&#x27;s army. Upon arriving at Washington&#x27;s camp, Connecticut Governor Jonathan Trumbull appointed Wolcott brigadier general in command of all the state&#x27;s militia regiments in New York. He led 300 to 400 volunteers from his brigade to help General Horatio Gates and Benedict Arnold defeat General John Burgoyne at the Battles of Saratoga.

In May 1779, Wolcott was promoted to major general in command of all Connecticut militia. That summer, he saw combat in protecting the coastline from Tryon&#x27;s raid. He was largely unsuccessful in his combat with Major General William Tryon. Over the course of the war, he showed great disdain towards his opposition, describing the British in his memoirs as &quot;a foe who have not only insulted every principle which governs civilized nations but by their barbarities offered the grossest indignities to human nature.&quot;

=== Continental Congress ===
At the beginning of the Revolution, Congress had made Wolcott a commissioner of Indian affairs to persuade the northern Indian nations to remain neutral. His qualifications for that role came from his early experience on the northern front of the French and Indian War. He was asked, along with Richard Butler and Arthur Lee, to negotiate a peace treaty with the Six Nations at Fort Schuyler.

He was elected to the Continental Congress in 1775. He became seriously ill in 1776 and did not sign the Declaration of Independence until some time later.

Beyond his postwar diplomatic role, Wolcott aspired to higher office. He was elected Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut as a Federalist in 1786 and served in that position for ten years. Wolcott became governor when Samuel Huntington died on January 5, 1796, holding the office until his own death at age 71. He also served as a judge of the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors from 1784 until his death.

==Death and legacy==

Wolcott died on December 1, 1797, in Litchfield, where he is interred at East Cemetery. Historian Ellsworth Grant remembers Wolcott&#x27;s Revolutionary War efforts in stating that, &quot;It is doubtful if any other official in Connecticut during this period carried so many public duties on his shoulders.&quot;
Oliver Wolcott Jr., his son, served as Secretary of the Treasury under Presidents George Washington and John Adams and as governor of Connecticut. His descendants include Congregationalist minister Samuel Wolcott, D.D.; Edward O. Wolcott, a United States Senator from Denver; Anna Wolcott Vaile, who established the Wolcott School for Girls in Denver; ethnologist George Gibbs; chemist Oliver Wolcott Gibbs; Brigadier General Alfred Gibbs; and mountaineer Roger Wolcott Toll.

The town of Wolcott, Connecticut, bears his name. In Torrington, Connecticut, there is a school named after him, The Oliver Wolcott Technical High School. His home in Litchfield was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1971. In 1798, Fort Washington on Goat Island in Newport, Rhode Island was renamed Fort Wolcott and was an active fortification until 1836; it later became the site of the United States Naval Torpedo Station.

<text>John Witherspoon (February 5, 1723 – November 15, 1794) was a Scottish-American Presbyterian minister, educator, farmer, slaveholder, and a Founding Father of the United States. Witherspoon embraced the concepts of Scottish common sense realism, and while president of the College of New Jersey (1768–1794; now Princeton University) became an influential figure in the development of the United States&#x27; national character. Politically active, Witherspoon was a delegate from New Jersey to the Second Continental Congress and a signatory to the July 4, 1776, Declaration of Independence. He was the only active clergyman and the only college president to sign the Declaration. Later, he signed the Articles of Confederation and supported ratification of the Constitution of the United States.

In 1789 he was convening moderator of the First General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.

== Early life and ministry in Scotland ==
John Witherspoon was born in Yester, Scotland, documented in the Old Parish Register as the eldest child of the Reverend James Alexander Witherspoon and Anne Walker, a descendant of John Welsh of Ayr and John Knox. This latter claim of Knox descent though ancient in origin is long disputed and without primary documentation. He attended the Haddington Grammar School and obtained a Master of Arts from the University of Edinburgh in 1739. He remained at the university to study divinity. In 1764, he was awarded an honorary doctoral degree in divinity by the University of St Andrews.

Witherspoon was a staunch Protestant, nationalist, and supporter of republicanism. Consequently, he was opposed to the Roman Catholic Legitimist Jacobite rising of 1745–46. Following the Jacobite victory at the Battle of Falkirk, he was briefly imprisoned at Doune Castle, which had a long-term effect on his health.

He became a Church of Scotland (Presbyterian) minister at Beith, Ayrshire (1745–1758), where he married Elizabeth Montgomery of Craighouse. They had ten children, with five surviving to adulthood.

From 1758 to 1768, he was minister of the Laigh Kirk, Paisley (Low Kirk). Witherspoon became prominent within the Church as an Evangelical opponent of the Moderate Party. During his two pastorates he wrote three well-known works on theology, notably the satire &quot;Ecclesiastical Characteristics&quot; (1753), which opposed the philosophical influence of Francis Hutcheson.

== Princeton ==

At the urging of Benjamin Rush and Richard Stockton, whom he met in Paisley, Witherspoon finally accepted their renewed invitation (having turned one down in 1766) to become president and head professor of the small Presbyterian College of New Jersey in Princeton. Thus, Witherspoon and his family emigrated to New Jersey in 1768.

At the age of 45, he became the sixth president of the college, later known as Princeton University. Upon his arrival, Witherspoon found the school in debt, with weak instruction, and a library collection which clearly failed to meet student needs. He immediately began fund-raising—locally and back home in Scotland—added three hundred of his own books to the library, and began purchasing scientific equipment including the Rittenhouse orrery, many maps, and a terrestrial globe. Witherspoon instituted numerous reforms, including modeling the syllabus and university structure after that used at the University of Edinburgh and other Scottish universities. He also firmed up entrance requirements, which helped the school compete with Harvard and Yale for scholars.

Witherspoon personally taught courses in eloquence or belles lettres, chronology (history), and divinity. However, none was more important than moral philosophy (a required course). An advocate of natural law within a Christian and republican cosmology, Witherspoon considered moral philosophy vital for ministers, lawyers, and those holding positions in government (magistrates). Firm but good-humored in his leadership, Witherspoon was very popular among both faculty and students.

Witherspoon had been a prominent evangelical Presbyterian minister in Scotland before accepting the Princeton position. As the college&#x27;s primary occupation at the time was training ministers, Witherspoon became a major leader of the early Presbyterian Church in America. He helped organize Nassau Presbyterian Church in Princeton, New Jersey.

Nonetheless, Witherspoon transformed a college designed predominantly to train clergymen into a school that would equip the leaders of a new country. Students who later played prominent roles in the new nation&#x27;s development included James Madison, Aaron Burr, Philip Freneau, William Bradford, and Hugh Henry Brackenridge. From among his students came 37 judges (three of whom became justices of the U.S. Supreme Court); 10 Cabinet officers; 12 members of the Continental Congress, 28 U.S. Senators, and 49 U.S. Congressmen.

Although Witherspoon can be heavily credited in the expansion and progression of the university, his ownership ties to the enslavement of Black people in America have caused for an internal Princeton petition to the CPUC Committee on Naming at Princeton University and President Eisgruber for the removal of his statue that currently stands in Firestone Plaza on campus. The statue was originally installed in 2001. As of Fall 2022, the petition has garnered over 250 signatures in support of removing the statue on the basis that it is a distraction to the university&#x27;s mission and makes community members uncomfortable because of Witherspoon&#x27;s racist history. The petitions suggests replacing the statue with &quot;an informational plaque which details both the positive and negative aspects of Witherspoon&#x27;s legacy.&quot;

== Revolutionary War ==

Long wary of the power of the British Crown, Witherspoon saw the growing centralization of government, progressive ideology of colonial authorities, and establishment of episcopacy authority as a threat to the liberties of the colonies. Of particular interest to Witherspoon was the Crown&#x27;s growing interference in the local and colonial affairs which previously had been the prerogatives and rights of the American authorities. When the Crown began to give additional authority to its appointed episcopacy over church affairs, British authorities hit a nerve in the Presbyterian Scot, who saw such events in the same lens as his Scottish Covenanters. Soon, Witherspoon came to support the American Revolution, joining the New Jersey Committee of Correspondence and Safety in early 1774. His 1776 sermon &quot;The Dominion of Providence over the Passions of Men&quot; was published in many editions, and he was elected to the Continental Congress as part of the New Jersey delegation. In Congress, he was appointed congressional chaplain, and in July 1776, he voted to adopt the Virginia Resolution for Independence. In answer to an objection that the country was not yet ready for independence, according to tradition he replied that it &quot;was not only ripe for the measure, but in danger of rotting for the want of it.&quot;

Witherspoon served in Congress from June 1777 until November 1784 and became one of its most influential members and a workhorse of prodigious energy. He served on over 100 committees, most notably the sitting committees, the board of peace and the committee on public correspondence or common affairs. He spoke often in concurrence; helped draft the Articles of Confederation; helped organize the executive departments; played a major role in shaping public policy; and drew up the instructions for the peace commissioners. He fought against the flood of paper money and opposed the issuance of bonds without provision for their amortization. &quot;No business can be done, some say, because money is scarce&quot;, he wrote. He also served twice in the New Jersey Legislature and strongly supported the adoption of the United States Constitution during the New Jersey ratification debates.

In November 1777, as British forces neared, Witherspoon closed and evacuated the College of New Jersey. The main building, Nassau Hall, was badly damaged, and his papers and personal notes were lost. Witherspoon was responsible for its reconstruction after the war, which caused him great personal and financial difficulty. In 1780 he was elected to a one-year term in the New Jersey Legislative Council representing Somerset County, and was a candidate for Congress in 1789 and 1791. At age 68, he married a 24-year-old widow, with whom he had two more children.

== Death and burial ==

Witherspoon suffered eye injuries and was blind by 1792. He died in 1794 on his farm Tusculum, just outside Princeton, and is buried along Presidents Row in Princeton Cemetery. An inventory of Witherspoon&#x27;s possessions taken at his death included &quot;two slaves ... valued at a hundred dollars each&quot;.

== Family ==
Witherspoon married Elizabeth Montgomery on 14 August 1748 documented in the old parish register in Beith, North Ayrshire. They were both from the parish. They had a total of 10 children, only five of whom survived to accompany their parents to America. James, the eldest, graduated from Princeton in 1770 and joined the Continental Army as an aide to General Francis Nash, with the rank of major and was killed at the Battle of Germantown on October 4, 1777. The next oldest son, John, graduated from Princeton in 1779, practiced medicine in South Carolina, and was lost at sea in 1795. David, the youngest son, graduated the same year as his brother John, married the widow of Abner Nash, and practiced law in New Bern, North Carolina. Anna, the eldest daughter, married the Reverend Samuel Smith on June 28, 1775. The Reverend Samuel Smith succeeded Dr. Witherspoon as president of Princeton in 1795. Frances, the youngest daughter, married Dr. David Ramsay, a delegate from South Carolina to the Continental Congress, on March 18, 1763.

== Philosophy ==

According to Herbert Hovenkamp, Witherspoon&#x27;s most lasting contribution was the initiation of the Scottish common sense realism, which he had learned by reading Thomas Reid and two of his expounders Dugald Stewart and James Beattie. 

At the College of New Jersey, Witherspoon revised the moral philosophy curriculum, strengthened the college&#x27;s commitment to natural philosophy, and positioned Princeton in the larger transatlantic world of the republic of letters. Witherspoon was a proponent of Christian values, his common sense approach to the public morality of civil magistrates was influenced by the ethics of Scottish philosophers Francis Hutcheson and Reid rather than Jonathan Edwards. In regard to civil magistrates, Witherspoon thus believed moral judgment should be pursued as a science. He held to old concepts from the Roman Republic of virtuous leadership by civil magistrates, but he also regularly recommended that his students read such modern philosophers as Machiavelli, Montesquieu, and David Hume, even though he disapproved of Hume&#x27;s &quot;infidel&quot; stance on religion.

Virtue, he argued, could be deduced through the development of the moral sense, an ethical compass instilled by God in all human beings and developed through religious education (Reid) or civil sociability (Hutcheson). Witherspoon saw morality as having two distinct components: spiritual and . Civil government owed more to the latter than the former in Witherspoon&#x27;s Presbyterian doctrine. Thus, public morality owed more to the natural moral laws of the Enlightenment than to revealed Christianity.

In his lectures on moral philosophy at Princeton, required of all juniors and seniors, Witherspoon argued for the revolutionary right of resistance and recommended checks and balances within government. He made a profound impression on his student James Madison, whose suggestions for the United States Constitution followed both Witherspoon&#x27;s and Hume&#x27;s ideas. The historian Douglass Adair writes, &quot;The syllabus of Witherspoon&#x27;s lectures . . . explains the conversion of the young Virginian to the philosophy of the Enlightenment.&quot;

Witherspoon accepted the impossibility of maintaining public morality or virtue in the citizenry without an effective religion. In this sense, the temporal principles of morality required a religious component which derived its authority from the spiritual. Therefore, public religion was a vital necessity in maintaining the public morals. However, in this framework, non-Christian societies could have virtue, which, by his definition, could be found in natural law. Witherspoon, in accordance with the Scottish moral sense philosophy, taught that all human beings, Christian or otherwise, could be virtuous, but he was nonetheless committed to Christianity as the only route to personal salvation.

Witherspoon owned slaves and lectured against the abolition of slavery.

However, in his &quot;Lectures on Moral Philosophy&quot;, Dr. Witherspoon advocated for the humane treatment of laborers and servants (including slaves), stating:
The settled opinion among the American founding fathers, including Dr. Witherspoon, was that slavery would eventually disappear naturally within a generation. For this reason, Rev. Witherspoon advocated for &quot;gradual emancipation&quot; of slaves. 
== Legacy ==
Witherspoon was firmly grounded in the Reformed tradition of High to Late Orthodoxy, embedded in the transatlantic Evangelical Awakening of the eighteenth century, and frustrated by the state of religion in the Scottish Kirk. Like Benedict Pictet (1655–1724), Witherspoon held firmly to the tenets of confessional Calvinism. And like Pictet, Witherspoon was eager to show that the truths of supernatural revelation could be squared with reason. His aim as a minister was to defend and articulate traditional Scottish Presbyterian theology, without altering or disguising it.

<text>Dr. Benjamin Rush (April 19, 1813) was an American revolutionary, a Founding Father of the United States and signatory to the U.S. Declaration of Independence, and a civic leader in Philadelphia, where he was a physician, politician, social reformer, humanitarian, educator, and the founder of Dickinson College. Rush was a Pennsylvania delegate to the Continental Congress. He later described his efforts in support of the American Revolution, saying: &quot;He aimed well.&quot; He served as surgeon general of the Continental Army and became a professor of chemistry, medical theory, and clinical practice at the University of Pennsylvania.

Dr. Benjamin Rush was a leader of the American Enlightenment and an enthusiastic supporter of the American Revolution. He was a leader in Pennsylvania&#x27;s ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1788. He was prominent in many reforms, especially in the areas of medicine and education. He opposed slavery, advocated free public schools, and sought improved, but patriarchal, education for women, and a more enlightened penal system. As a leading physician, Rush had a major impact on the emerging medical profession.

As an Enlightenment intellectual, Rush was committed to organizing all medical knowledge around explanatory theories, rather than relying on empirical methods. Rush argued that illness was the result of imbalances in the body&#x27;s physical system and was caused by malfunctions in the brain. His approach prepared the way for later medical research, but Rush undertook none of it. He promoted public health by advocating clean environment and stressing the importance of personal and military hygiene. His study of mental disorder made him one of the founders of American psychiatry. In 1965, the American Psychiatric Association recognized Rush as the &quot;father of American psychiatry&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Rush was born to John Rush and Susanna Hall on January 4, 1746 (December 24, 1745, O.S.). The family, of English descent, lived on a farm in the Township of Byberry in Philadelphia County, about 14 miles outside of Philadelphia (the township was incorporated into Philadelphia in 1854). Rush was the fourth of seven children. His father died in July 1751 at age 39, leaving his mother, who ran a country store, to care for the family. At age eight, Benjamin was sent to live with an aunt and uncle to receive an education. He and his older brother Jacob attended a school run by Reverend Samuel Finley, which later became West Nottingham Academy.

In 1760, after further studies at the College of New Jersey, which in 1895 became Princeton University, Rush graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree at age 14. From 1761 to 1766, Rush apprenticed under Dr. John Redman in Philadelphia. Redman encouraged him to further his studies at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, where Rush studied from 1766 to 1768 and earned an M.D. degree. Rush became fluent in French, Italian, and Spanish as a result of his studies and European tour. While at Edinburgh, he became a friend of the Earl of Leven and his family, including William Leslie.

Returning to the Colonies in 1769, Rush opened a medical practice in Philadelphia and became professor of chemistry at the College of Philadelphia (which in 1791 changed its name to its present name, University of Pennsylvania). After his election to the revived American Philosophical Society in 1768, Rush served as the society&#x27;s curator from 1770 to 1773, as secretary from 1773 to 1773, and vice president from 1797 to 1801. Rush ultimately published the first American textbook on chemistry and several volumes on medical student education and wrote influential patriotic essays.

==Revolutionary period==

Rush was active in the Sons of Liberty and was elected to attend the provincial conference to send delegates to the Continental Congress. Thomas Paine consulted Rush when writing the profoundly influential pro-independence pamphlet &quot;Common Sense&quot;. Starting in 1776, Rush represented Pennsylvania and signed the Declaration of Independence. He also represented Philadelphia at Pennsylvania&#x27;s own Constitutional Convention.

In an 1811 letter to John Adams, Rush recounted in stark fashion the signing of the Declaration of Independence. He described it as a scene of &quot;pensive and awful silence&quot;. Rush said the delegates were called up, one after another, and then filed forward somberly to subscribe to what each thought was their ensuing death warrant. He related that the &quot;gloom of the morning&quot; was briefly interrupted when the rotund Benjamin Harrison of Virginia said to a diminutive Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, at the signing table, &quot;I shall have a great advantage over you, Mr. Gerry, when we are all hung for what we are now doing. From the size and weight of my body I shall die in a few minutes and be with the Angels, but from the lightness of your body you will dance in the air an hour or two before you are dead.&quot; According to Rush, Harrison&#x27;s remark &quot;procured a transient smile, but it was soon succeeded by the Solemnity with which the whole business was conducted.&quot;
While Rush was representing Pennsylvania in the Continental Congress (and serving on its medical committee), he also used his medical skills in the field. Rush accompanied the Philadelphia militia during the battles after which the British occupied Philadelphia and most of New Jersey. He was depicted serving in the Battle of Princeton in the painting &quot;The Death of General Mercer at the Battle of Princeton, January 3, 1777&quot; by the American artist John Trumbull.

The Army Medical Service was in disarray, between the military casualties, extremely high losses from typhoid, yellow fever and other camp illnesses, political conflicts between Dr. John Morgan and Dr. William Shippen Jr., and inadequate supplies and guidance from the medical committee. Nonetheless, Rush accepted an appointment as surgeon-general of the middle department of the Continental Army. Rush&#x27;s order &quot;Directions for preserving the health of soldiers&quot; became one of the foundations of preventive military medicine and was repeatedly republished, including as late as 1908. However, Rush&#x27;s reporting of Shippen&#x27;s misappropriation of food and wine supplies intended to comfort hospitalized soldiers, under-reporting of patient deaths, and failure to visit the hospitals under his command, ultimately led to Rush&#x27;s resignation in 1778.

==Controversy==
Rush criticized General George Washington in two handwritten but unsigned letters while still serving under the surgeon general. One, to Virginia Governor Patrick Henry dated October 13, 1778, quotes General Thomas Conway saying that if not for God&#x27;s grace the ongoing war would have been lost by Washington and his weak counselors. Henry forwarded the letter to Washington, despite Rush&#x27;s request that the criticism be conveyed orally, and Washington recognized the handwriting. At the time, the supposed Conway Cabal was reportedly trying to replace Washington with Horatio Gates as commander-in-chief. Rush&#x27;s letter relayed General John Sullivan&#x27;s criticism that forces directly under Washington were undisciplined and mob-like, and contrasted Gates&#x27; army as &quot;a well-regulated family&quot;. Ten days later, Rush wrote to John Adams relaying complaints inside Washington&#x27;s army, including about &quot;bad bread, no order, universal disgust&quot; and praising Conway, who had been appointed to inspector general.

Shippen sought Rush&#x27;s resignation and received it by the end of the month after Continental Congress delegate John Witherspoon, chairman of a committee to investigate Morgan&#x27;s and Rush&#x27;s charges of misappropriation and mismanagement against Shippen, told Rush his complaints would not produce reform. Rush later expressed regret for his gossip against Washington. In a letter to John Adams in 1812, Rush wrote, &quot;He [Washington] was the highly favored instrument whose patriotism and name contributed greatly to the establishment of the independence of the United States.&quot; Rush also successfully pleaded with Washington&#x27;s biographers Justice Bushrod Washington and Chief Justice John Marshall to delete his association with those stinging words.

In his 2005 book &quot;1776&quot;, David McCullough quotes Rush, referring to George Washington:

==Post-Revolution==

Rush believed that, while America was free from British rule, the &quot;American Revolution&quot; had yet to finish. As expressed in his 1787 &#x27;Address to the People of the United States&#x27;, &quot;The American war is over: but this is far from being the case with the American revolution. On the contrary, nothing but the first act of the great drama is closed.&quot; In this address, he encouraged Americans to &quot;come forward&quot; and continue advancements on behalf of America.

In 1783, he was appointed to the staff of Pennsylvania Hospital, and he remained a member until his death. He was elected to the Pennsylvania convention which adopted the Federal constitution and was appointed treasurer of the United States Mint, serving from 1797 to 1813. He was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1788.

He became a professor of medical theory and clinical practice at the University of Pennsylvania in 1791, though the quality of his medicine was quite primitive even for the time: he advocated bloodletting for almost any illness, long after its practice had declined. While teaching at the University of Pennsylvania, one of his students was future president William Henry Harrison, who took a chemistry class from Rush.

He was also founder of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. In 1794, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In the 1793 Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic, Rush treated patients with bleeding, calomel, and other early medicinal techniques that often were ineffective and actually brought many patients closer to their deathbeds. Rush&#x27;s ideas on yellow fever treatments differed from those of many experienced French doctors, who came from the West Indies where there were yellow fever outbreaks every year. However, he also helped the population of the city by convincing Richard Allen to ask members of his African Methodist Episcopal Church and other free blacks, who it was believed were less affected by yellow fever than other Philadelphians, to perform volunteer aid work for doctors and funeral homes.

Rush came down with yellow fever himself during the 1793 epidemic, although he recovered from it.

Rush took on several social causes during his lifetime. Rush became a social activist and an abolitionist and was a founding member of the Philadelphia Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons (known today as the Pennsylvania Prison Society), which greatly influenced the construction of Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia. He supported Thomas Jefferson for president in 1796 over the eventual winner, John Adams.

In 1803, Jefferson sent Meriwether Lewis to Philadelphia to prepare for the Lewis and Clark Expedition under the tutelage of Rush, who taught Lewis about frontier illnesses and the performance of bloodletting. Rush provided the corps with a medical kit that included:
* Turkish opium for nervousness
* emetics to induce vomiting
* medicinal wine
* fifty dozen of &quot;Dr. Rush&#x27;s Bilious Pills,&quot; laxatives containing more than 50% mercury, which have since colloquially been referred to as &quot;thunderclappers&quot;. Their meat-rich diet and lack of clean water during the expedition gave the men cause to use them frequently. Although their efficacy is questionable, their high mercury content provided a tracer by which archaeologists have been able to verify one of the Corps&#x27; campsites on their route to the Pacific. As of 2024, Travelers&#x27; Rest State Park, near Lolo, Montana, is the only location to be confirmed via the analysis of the Corps&#x27; latrines.

==Reforms==

===Anti-slavery===
In 1766, when Rush set out for his studies in Edinburgh, he was outraged by the sight of 100 slave ships in Liverpool harbor. As a prominent Presbyterian doctor and professor of chemistry in Philadelphia, he provided a bold and respected voice against the slave trade. He warmly praised the ministry of &quot;Black Harry&quot; Hosier, the freedman circuit rider who accompanied Bishop Francis Asbury during the establishment of the Methodist Church in America, but the highlight of his involvement was the pamphlet he wrote in 1773 entitled &quot;An Address to the Inhabitants of the British Settlements in America, upon Slave-Keeping.&quot; In this first of his many attacks on the social evils of his day, he assailed the slave trade as well as the entire institution of slavery. Rush argued scientifically that Blacks were not by nature intellectually or morally inferior. Any apparent evidence to the contrary was only the perverted expression of slavery, which &quot;is so foreign to the human mind, that the moral faculties, as well as those of the understanding are debased, and rendered torpid by it.&quot;

===Anti-capital punishment===
Rush deemed public punishments such as putting a person on display in stocks, common at the time, to be counterproductive. Instead, he proposed private confinement, labor, solitude, and religious instruction for criminals, and he opposed the death penalty. His outspoken opposition to capital punishment pushed the Pennsylvania legislature to abolish the death penalty for all crimes other than first-degree murder. He authored a 1792 treatise on punishing murder by death in which he made three principal arguments:
:I. Every man possesses an absolute power over his own liberty and property, but not over his own life...
:II. The punishment of murder by death, is contrary to reason, and to the order and happiness of society...
:III. The punishment of murder by death, is contrary to divine revelation.

Rush led the state of Pennsylvania to establish the first state penitentiary, the Walnut Street Prison, in 1790. Rush campaigned for long-term imprisonment, the denial of liberty, as both the most humane but severe punishment. This 1792 treatise was preceded by comments on the efficacy of the death penalty that he self-references and which, evidently, appeared in the second volume of the &quot;American Museum&quot;.

===Status of women===
After the Revolution, Rush proposed a new model of education for elite women that included English language, vocal music, dancing, sciences, bookkeeping, history, and moral philosophy. He was instrumental to the founding of the Young Ladies&#x27; Academy of Philadelphia, the first chartered women&#x27;s institution of higher education in Philadelphia. Rush saw little need for training women in metaphysics, logic, mathematics, or advanced science; rather he wanted the emphasis on guiding women toward moral essays, poetry, history, and religious writings. This type of education for elite women grew dramatically during the post-revolutionary period, as women claimed a role in creating the Republic. And so, the ideal of Republican motherhood emerged, lauding women&#x27;s responsibility of instructing the young in the obligations of patriotism, the blessings of liberty and the true meaning of Republicanism. He opposed coeducational classrooms and insisted on the need to instruct all youth in the Christian religion.

==Medical contributions==
===Physical medicine===

Rush was a leading proponent of heroic medicine. He firmly believed in such practices as bloodletting patients (a practice now known to be generally harmful, but at the time common practice), as well as purges using calomel and other toxic substances. In his report on the Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic of 1793, Rush wrote: &quot;I have found bleeding to be useful, not only in cases where the pulse was full and quick but where it was slow and tense. I have bled twice in many and in one acute case four times, with the happiest effect. I consider intrepidity in the use of the lancet, at present, to be necessary, as it is in the use of mercury and jalap, in this insidious and ferocious disease.&quot; During that epidemic, Rush gained acclaim for remaining in town and treating sometimes 100 patients per day (some through freed black volunteers coordinated by Richard Allen), but many died. Even Rush acknowledged the failure of two treatments, sweats in vinegar-wrapped blankets accompanied by mercury rubs, and cold baths.

William Cobbett vociferously objected to Rush&#x27;s extreme use of bloodletting, and even in Rush&#x27;s day and location, many physicians had abandoned on scientific grounds this favorite remedy of Rush&#x27;s former teachers Thomas Sydenham and Hermann Boerhaave. Cobbett accused Rush of killing more patients than he had saved. Rush ultimately sued Cobbett for libel, winning a judgment of $5,000 and $3,000 in court costs, which was only partially paid before Cobbett returned to England. Nonetheless, Rush&#x27;s practice waned as he continued to advocate bloodletting and purges, much to the chagrin of his friend Thomas Jefferson. Some even blamed Rush&#x27;s bleeding for hastening the death of Benjamin Franklin, as well as George Washington (although the only one of Washington&#x27;s medics who opposed the bleeding was Rush&#x27;s former student), and Rush insisted upon being bled himself shortly before his death (as he had during the yellow fever epidemic two decades earlier).

Rush also wrote the first case report on dengue fever (published in 1789 on a case from 1780). Perhaps his greatest contributions to physical medicine were his establishment of a public dispensary for low-income patients (Philadelphia Dispensary), and public works associated with draining and rerouting Dock Creek (eliminating mosquito breeding grounds, which greatly decreased typhus, typhoid and cholera outbreaks).

Another of Rush&#x27;s medical views that now draws criticism is his analysis of race. In reviewing the case of Henry Moss, a slave who lost his dark skin color (probably through vitiligo), Rush characterized being black as a hereditary and curable skin disease. Rush wrote that the &quot;disease, instead of inviting us [whites] to tyrannise over them [blacks], it should entitle them to a double portion of our humanity.&quot; He added that this &quot;should teach white people the necessity of keeping up that prejudice against [miscegenation], as it would tend to infect posterity with … their disorder&quot; and called for an &quot;endeavour to discover a remedy for it.&quot;

Rush was interested in Native American health. He wanted to find out why Native Americans were susceptible to certain illnesses and whether they had higher mortality rates as compared to other people. Other questions that he raised were whether they dreamed more and if their hair turned gray as they got older. His fascination with indigenous peoples came from his interest in the theory that social scientists can better study the history of their own civilization by studying cultures in earlier stages of development, &quot;primitive men&quot;. In his autobiography, he writes &quot;From a review of the three different species of settlers, it appears that there are certain regular stages which mark the progress from the savage to civilized life. The first settler is nearly related to an Indian in his manners. In the second, the Indian manners are more diluted. It is in the third species only that we behold civilization completed. It is to the third species of settlers only that it is proper to apply the term of farmers. While we record the voices of the first and second settlers, it is but just to mention their virtues likewise. Their mutual wants to produce mutual dependence; hence they are kind and friendly to each other. Their solitary situation makes visitors agreeable to them; hence they are hospitable to a stranger.&quot;

===Mental health===

Rush published one of the first descriptions and treatments for psychiatric disorders in American medicine, &quot;Medical Inquiries and Observations, Upon the Diseases of the Mind&quot; (1812). He undertook to classify different forms of mental illness and to theorize as to their causes and possible cures. Rush believed (incorrectly) that many mental illnesses were caused by disruptions of blood circulation or by sensory overload and treated them with devices meant to improve circulation to the brain such as a centrifugal spinning board, and inactivity/sensory deprivation via a restraining chair with a sensory-deprivation head enclosure (&quot;tranquilizer chair&quot;). After seeing mental patients in appalling conditions in Pennsylvania Hospital, Rush led a successful campaign in 1792 for the state to build a separate mental ward where the patients could be kept in more humane conditions.

Rush believed, as did so many physicians of the time, that bleeding and active purging with mercury(I) chloride (calomel) were the preferable medical treatments for insanity, a fact evidenced by his statement that, &quot;It is sometimes difficult to prevail upon patients in this state of madness, or even to compel them, to take mercury in any of the ways in which it is usually administered. In these cases I have succeeded, by sprinkling a few grains of calomel daily upon a piece of bread, and afterwards spreading over it, a thin covering of butter.&quot; Rush followed the standard procedures of bleeding and treatment with mercury, he did believe that &quot;coercion&quot; and &quot;restraint&quot;, the physical punishment, chains and dungeons, which were the practice of the time, were the answer as proven by his invention of the restraint chair and other devices. For this reason, some aspects of his approach could be seen as similar to &quot;Moral Therapy,&quot; which would soon rise to prominence in at least the wealthier institutions of Europe and the United States.

Rush is sometimes considered a pioneer of occupational therapy particularly as it pertains to the institutionalized. In &quot;Diseases of the Mind&quot; (1812), Rush wrote:
Furthermore, Rush was one of the first people to describe Savant Syndrome. In 1789, he described the abilities of Thomas Fuller, an enslaved African who was a lightning calculator. His observation would later be described in other individuals by notable scientists like John Langdon Down.

Rush pioneered the therapeutic approach to addiction. Prior to his work, drunkenness was viewed as being sinful and a matter of choice. Rush believed that the alcoholic loses control over himself and identified the properties of alcohol, rather than the alcoholic&#x27;s choice, as the causal agent. He developed the conception of alcoholism as a form of medical disease and proposed that alcoholics should be weaned from their addiction via less potent substances.

Rush advocated for more humane mental institutions and perpetuated the idea that people with mental illness are people who have an illness, rather than inhuman animals. He is quoted to have said, &quot;Terror acts powerfully upon the body, through the medium of the mind, and should be employed in the cure of madness.&quot; He also championed the idea of &quot;partial madness,&quot; or that people could have varying degrees of mental illness.

The American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s seal bears an image of Rush&#x27;s purported profile at its center. The outer ring of the seal contains the words &quot;American Psychiatric Association 1844&quot;. The Association&#x27;s history of the seal states: 
==Educational legacy==
During his career, he educated over 3,000 medical students, and several of these established Rush Medical College in Chicago in his honor after his death. His students included Valentine Seaman, who mapped yellow fever mortality patterns in New York and introduced the smallpox vaccine to the United States in 1799. One of his last apprentices was Samuel A. Cartwright, later a Confederate States of America surgeon charged with improving sanitary conditions in the camps around Vicksburg, Mississippi, and Port Hudson, Louisiana. Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, formerly Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke&#x27;s Medical Center, was named in his honor.

==Religious views and vision==

Rush advocated Christianity in public life and in education and sometimes compared himself to the prophet Jeremiah. Rush regularly attended Christ Church in Philadelphia and counted William White among his closest friends (and neighbors). Ever the controversialist, Rush became involved in internal disputes over the revised Book of Common Prayer and the splitting of the Episcopal Church from the Church of England. He dabbled with Presbyterianism, Methodism (which split from Anglicanism in those years), and Unitarianism. In a letter to John Adams, Rush describes his religious views as &quot;a compound of the orthodoxy and heterodoxy of most of our Christian churches.&quot; Christian Universalists consider him one of their founders, although Rush stopped attending that church after the death of his friend, former Baptist pastor Elhanan Winchester, in 1797.

Rush fought for temperance and both public and Sunday schools. He helped found the Bible Society at Philadelphia (now known as the Pennsylvania Bible Society) and promoted the American Sunday School Union. When many public schools stopped using the Bible as a textbook, Rush proposed that the U.S. government require such use, as well as furnish an American Bible to every family at public expense. In 1806, Rush proposed inscribing &quot;The Son of Man Came into the World, Not To Destroy Men&#x27;s Lives, But To Save Them.&quot; above the doors of courthouses and other public buildings. Earlier, on July 16, 1776, Rush had complained to Patrick Henry about a provision in Virginia&#x27;s constitution of 1776 which forbade clergymen from serving in the legislature.

Rush felt that the United States was the work of God: &quot;I do not believe that the Constitution was the offspring of inspiration, but I am as perfectly satisfied that the Union of the United States in its form and adoption is as much the work of a Divine Providence as any of the miracles recorded in the Old and New Testament&quot;. In 1798, after the Constitution&#x27;s adoption, Rush declared: &quot;The only foundation for a useful education in a republic is to be laid in Religion. Without this there can be no virtue, and without virtue there can be no liberty, and liberty is the object and life of all republican governments.&quot; One quote popularly assigned to Rush, however, which portrays him as a medical libertarian: &quot;Unless we put medical freedoms into the Constitution, the time will come when medicine will organize into an undercover dictatorship [. . .] To restrict the art of healing to one class of men and deny equal privileges to others will constitute the Bastille of medical science. All such laws are un-American and despotic and have no place in a republic [. . .] The Constitution of this republic should make special privilege for medical freedom as well as religious freedom,&quot; is likely a misattribution. No primary source for it has been found, and the words &quot;un-American&quot; and &quot;undercover&quot; are anachronisms, as their usage as such did not appear until after Rush&#x27;s death.

Before 1779, Rush&#x27;s religious views were influenced by what he described as &quot;Fletcher&#x27;s controversy with the Calvinists in favor of the Universality of the atonement.&quot; After hearing Elhanan Winchester preach, Rush indicated that this theology &quot;embraced and reconciled my ancient calvinistical, and my newly adopted (Arminian) principles. From that time on I have never doubted upon the subject of the salvation of all men.&quot; To simplify, both believed in punishment after death for the wicked. His wife, Julia Rush, thought her husband like Martin Luther for his ardent passions, fearless attacks on old prejudices, and quick tongue against perceived enemies.

Rush helped Richard Allen found the African Methodist Episcopal Church. In his autobiography, Allen wrote:

==Personal life==
On January 11, 1776, Rush married Julia Stockton (1759–1848), daughter of Richard Stockton, another signer of the Declaration of Independence, and his wife Annis Boudinot Stockton. They had 13 children, 9 of whom survived their first year: John, Ann Emily, Richard, Susannah (died as an infant), Elizabeth Graeme (died as an infant), Mary B, James, William (died as an infant), Benjamin (died as an infant), Benjamin, Julia, Samuel, and William. Richard later became a member of the cabinets of James Madison, James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, and Zachary Taylor (at one point during each of their presidencies).

In 1812, Rush helped reconcile the friendship of Jefferson and Adams by encouraging the two former presidents to resume writing to each other. Once divided over politics and political rivalries, Jefferson and Adams grew close. On July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, Jefferson and Adams both died within hours of each other.

==Death==
After dying of typhus fever, he was buried (in Section N67) along with his wife Julia in the Christ Church Burial Ground in Philadelphia, not far from where Benjamin Franklin is buried. At the site, a small plaque honoring Benjamin Rush has been placed. However, the box marker is next to the plaque on the right, with inscriptions on the top. The inscription reads,

&lt;poem&gt;In memory of
Benjamin Rush MD
he died on the 19th of April
in the year of our Lord 1813
Aged 68 years
Well done good and faithful servant
enter thou into the joy of the Lord

Mrs Julia Rush
consort of
Benjamin Rush MD
Born March 2, 1759
Died July 7, 1848
For as in Adam, all die, even so in Christ
Shall all be made alive&lt;/poem&gt;

==Legacy==
Benjamin Rush Elementary School in Redmond, Washington, was named by its students for him. The Arts Academy at Benjamin Rush magnet high school in Philadelphia was established in 2008. Rush County, Indiana, is named for him as is its county seat, Rushville. In Chicago, Rush Street as well as Rush University Medical Center are both named for Rush. Benjamin Rush State Park in Philadelphia is named after Rush. The eponymous conservative Benjamin Rush Institute is an associate member of the State Policy Network.

<doc id="260901" wikidata="Q714967" url="?curid=260901" title="Philip Livingston">
<text>Philip Livingston (January 15, 1716 – June 12, 1778) was an American Founding Father, merchant, politician, and slave trader from New York City. He represented New York at the October 1774 First Continental Congress, where he favored imposing economic sanctions upon Great Britain as a way of pressuring the British Parliament to repeal the Intolerable Acts. Livingston was also a delegate to the Second Continental Congress from 1775 to 1778, and signed the Declaration of Independence.

==Early life==
Livingston was born in Albany, New York, on January 15, 1716, the fourth surviving son of Philip Livingston (1686–1749), 2nd Lord of the Manor, and Catherine Van Gogh Livingston, the daughter of New York Mayor Pieter Van Brugh. Along with his brother, William Livingston (1723–1790), he grew up in the Albany area, dividing his time between his father&#x27;s Albany townhouse and the manor house in Linlithgo, at the junction of the Roeliff Jansen Kill and the Hudson River.

==Mercantile career==

Livingston graduated from Yale College in 1737 and returned to Albany to undergo a mercantile apprenticeship under his father. Through his father&#x27;s influence, he obtained clerkships in Albany&#x27;s municipal government. Livingston subsequently moved to New York City and pursued a career in the import business, trading with the British West Indies. During King George&#x27;s War, Livingston made a fortune provisioning British forces and engaging in privateering. He also speculated heavily in real estate and the slave trade, financing at least fifteen slave-trading voyages, which transported hundreds of enslaved Africans to New York.

He purchased a stone townhouse on Duke Street, Manhattan, a forty-acre estate in Brooklyn Heights and personally owned several slaves, one of whom ran away in November 1752; Livingston published advertisements in several city newspapers, including the &quot;New-York Mercury&quot; and &quot;New-York Gazette&quot;, offering a reward for his recapture. He also served as an alderman of the East Ward from 1754 to 1762.

Livingston also became involved in the establishment of King&#x27;s College and helped to organize the New York Society Library in 1754. In 1756 he was president and founding member of the St. Andrew&#x27;s Society, New York&#x27;s first benevolent organization, and he founded New York City&#x27;s first chamber of commerce in 1768. Livingston was also one of the first governors of New York Hospital.

===Politics===
In 1754, Livingston went as a delegate to the Albany Congress. There, he joined delegates from several other colonies to negotiate with Indigenous nations and discuss common plans for dealing with the French and Indian War. Livingston became an active promoter of efforts to raise and fund troops for the war. According to Cynthia A. Kiemer, he owned shares in six privateers, making him one of the colony&#x27;s leading investors.

He served as a member of the provincial house of representatives from 1763 to 1769 and in 1768 served as speaker. In October 1765, he attended the Stamp Act Congress, which produced the first formal protest to the Crown as a prelude to the American Revolution. He joined New York City&#x27;s Committee of Correspondence to continue communication with leaders in the other colonies, and New York City&#x27;s Committee of Sixty. When New York established the New York Provincial Congress in 1775, he was named its president.

He was selected as one of the delegates to the Continental Congress. His brother William, a prominent lawyer in New Jersey, was also a delegate to the Continental Congress from 1774 to June 1776. In July 1775, Philip signed the Olive Branch Petition, a final attempt to achieve an understanding with the Crown.

When the British occupied New York City, Philip and his family fled to Kingston, New York, where he maintained another residence. During this time, his abandoned slaves &quot;may have sought their freedom in enemy-occupied Manhattan, where the British offered freedom to any black Americans willing to aid them in stamping down the American &#x27;rebellion.&#x27;&quot; After the Battle of Long Island, General George Washington and his officers met at Philip&#x27;s residence in Brooklyn Heights and decided to evacuate the island. The British subsequently used Philip&#x27;s Duke Street home as a barracks and his Brooklyn Heights residence as a Royal Navy hospital.

After the adoption of the new New York State Constitution, he was appointed to the New York State Senate southern district in 1777, while continuing to sit in the Continental Congress. Livingston suffered from dropsy, and his health deteriorated in 1778.

==Personal life==

On April 14, 1740, he married Christina Ten Broeck (1718–1801), daughter of Dirck Ten Broeck (1686–1751) and Margarita Cuyler (1682–1783). Christina was the sister of Albany Mayor Abraham Ten Broeck and the great-granddaughter of Albany Mayor Dirck Wesselse Ten Broeck (1638–1717), through her maternal grandfather, Wessel Ten Broeck (1664–1747). Together, Philip and Christina had nine children:

* Philip Philip Livingston (1741–1787), who married Sara Johnson (1749–1802)
* Dirck &quot;Richard&quot; Livingston (b. 1743), who died unmarried.
* Catherine Livingston (1745–1810), who married Stephen van Rensselaer II (1742–1769) in 1764. After his death, she married Eilardus Westerlo (1738–1790) in 1775.
* Margaret Livingston (1747–1830), who married Dr. Thomas Jones (1733–1794) of New York.
* Peter Van Brugh Livingston (b. 1751), who died unmarried.
* Sarah Livingston (1752–1814), who married Rev. John Henry Livingston (1746–1825), her second cousin.
* John Abraham Livingston (1754-1782), who served as commissary to the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War and who died unmarried in Charleston, South Carolina.
* Alida Livingston (b. 1757), who died unmarried.
* Henry Philip Livingston (b. 1760), a captain in General Washington&#x27;s Life Guard, who died unmarried.

=== Death ===
Livingston died suddenly while attending the sixth session of Congress in York, Pennsylvania, and is buried in the Prospect Hill Cemetery there. Livingston was a Presbyterian and a Mason. When Livingston died, his estate was insufficient to meet his debts, and his executors renounced the administration of the estate. On February 25, 1785, the New York Legislature passed an act, entitled &quot;An Act for vesting the Estate of Philip Livingston, late of the City of New-York, Esquire, deceased, in Trustees for the Payment of his Debts, and other Purposes therein mentioned&quot;, which named as trustees his son and heir, Philip Philip Livingston, Isaac Roosevelt, and Robert C. Livingston, his nephew who was a son of Robert Livingston, 3rd Lord of the Manor. The trustees were responsible for administering Livingston&#x27;s &quot;property, pay all debts, and discharge the pecuniary legacies.&quot; After his son&#x27;s death in 1788, Rev. John Henry Livingston, Thomas Jones, both his sons-in-law, Henry Brockholst Livingston, his nephew, and Alexander Hamilton were appointed the executors of his will.

===Descendants===
Through his son Philip, the only of his sons to have children, he was the grandfather of Philip Henry Livingston (1769–1831) and Edward Philip Livingston (1779–1843), the Lieutenant Governor of New York. Through Philip Henry, he was the great-grandfather of Edward Livingston (1796–1840), Speaker of the New York State Assembly. His granddaughter, Christina Livingston, married John Navarre Macomb (1774–1810), the son of Alexander Macomb (1748–1831) and brother of Maj. Gen. Alexander Macomb (1782–1841). Through his daughter Catherine, he was the grandfather of Stephen Van Rensselaer III (1764–1839), the patroon of Rensselaerswyck, Philip S. Van Rensselaer (1767–1824), the Mayor of Albany, Rensselaer Westerlo (1776–1851), a U.S. Representative, and Catharine Westerlo (1778–1846), who married John Woodworth, the New York State Attorney General.

===Legacy===
Livingston Avenue and the former Philip Livingston Magnet Academy, both in Albany, New York, are named for him. A public school in Brooklyn, PS 261 in Boerum Hill, used to be named for him, but the name was changed in 2022 to the Zipporiah Mills School, to honor the memory of a beloved and influential former principal at the school.

<text>Threat of force in public international law is a situation between states described by British lawyer Ian Brownlie as:
:an express or implied promise by a government of a resort to force conditional on non-acceptance of certain demands of that government.

The 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties notes in its preamble that both the threat and the use of force are prohibited. Moreover, in Article 52, it establishes the principle that if threats of using force are made during diplomatic negotiations, then any resulting treaty is invalid, stating &quot;A treaty is void if its conclusion has been procured by the threat or use of force in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations&quot;.

<text>A. N. Other is used as a placeholder name or, less commonly, a pseudonym used by a person wishing to remain anonymous. It is most used in the United Kingdom, often written as AN Other. Occasionally it may be abbreviated to ANO, or—in cases where a female name is expected—rendered as Ann(e) Other.

As a placeholder name, A. N. Other is commonly employed in lists of cricket players, where players&#x27; names are traditionally listed as initials and surname (e.g., I. T. Botham), for players whose names have not yet been announced or are unknown (e.g. &quot;Additional players: A. W. Smith, J. C. Taylor and A. N. Other&quot;).

The Formula One racing driver Jackie Stewart raced as &quot;A. N. Other&quot; early in his career, supposedly because his mother would worry if she knew he was racing cars.

Less frequently used is U. N. Owen, as for example used in the Agatha Christie novel &quot;And Then There Were None&quot;.

The name is also used for demonstration on sample documents and identity cards.

An equivalent term is &quot;NN&quot;, for &quot;Nomen nescio&quot;. Of equivalent function are TBA, TBC, and TBD (to be announced, confirmed, determined).

<doc id="260910" wikidata="Q354721" url="?curid=260910" title="Roger Sherman">
<text>Roger Sherman (April 19, 1721 – July 23, 1793) was an early American statesman, lawyer, and a Founding Father of the United States. He is the only person to sign all four great state papers of the United States: the Continental Association, the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the Constitution. He also signed the 1774 Petition to the King.

Born in Newton, Massachusetts, Sherman established a legal career in Litchfield County, Connecticut, despite a lack of formal education. After a period in the Connecticut House of Representatives, he served as a justice of the Superior Court of Connecticut from 1766 to 1789. He represented Connecticut at the Continental Congress, and he was a member of the Committee of Five that drafted the Declaration of Independence.

Sherman served as a delegate to the 1787 Philadelphia Convention, which produced the United States Constitution. After Benjamin Franklin, he was the second oldest delegate present at the convention. Sherman favored granting the federal government power to raise revenue and regulate commerce, but initially opposed efforts to supplant the Articles of Confederation with a new constitution. After supporting the establishment of a new constitution, Sherman became a key delegate and main opponent of James Madison&#x27;s Virginia Plan by introducing the Connecticut Compromise that won the approval of both the more and less populous states.

After the ratification of the Constitution, Sherman represented Connecticut in the United States House of Representatives from 1789 to 1791. He served in the United States Senate from 1791 to his death in 1793.

==Early life and family==

Sherman was born into a family of farmers in Newton, Massachusetts. His parents were William and Mehetabel Sherman. The Shermans left Newton and settled in what became the town of Stoughton, Massachusetts southeast of his home in Newton, when Roger was two. Sherman&#x27;s education did not extend beyond his father&#x27;s library and grammar school, and his early career was spent as a shoemaker. However, he had an aptitude for learning, access to a good library owned by his father, and a Harvard-educated parish minister, Rev. Samuel Dunbar, who took him under his wing.

In 1743, his father&#x27;s death led to Sherman moving with his mother and siblings to New Milford, Connecticut. There, in partnership with his brother William, he opened the town&#x27;s first store, a cobbler shop. He earned a position as the county surveyor in 1745. The income from this office enabled him to buy land and to earn a favorable reputation throughout the county. Sherman published a series of almanacs between 1750 and 1761. He also studied law on his own, passing the bar in 1754.

He very quickly introduced himself in civil and religious affairs, rapidly becoming one of the town&#x27;s leading citizens and eventually town clerk of New Milford. He became county surveyor of New Haven County in 1745 and began providing astronomical calculations for almanacs in 1759.

Sherman was married two times and had a total of fifteen children, with thirteen reaching adulthood. Sherman married Elizabeth Hartwell (born August 31, 1726, in Stoughton, Massachusetts) on November 17, 1749. Elizabeth died on October 19, 1760. Sherman married Rebecca (also spelled Rebekah) Prescott (born on May 20, 1742, in Danvers, Massachusetts) on May 12, 1763, and had eight children: Rebecca, Elizabeth, Roger, Mehetabel (1st), Mehetabel (2nd), Oliver, Martha and Sarah. Sherman was a 5th cousin 3 times removed of Union general William Tecumseh Sherman.

==Political career==
===Early political career===
Despite the fact that Sherman had no formal legal training, he was urged to read for the bar exam by a local lawyer and was admitted to the bar of Litchfield, Connecticut in 1754, during which he wrote &quot;A Caveat Against Injustice&quot; and was chosen to represent New Milford in the Connecticut House of Representatives from 1755 to 1758 and from 1760 to 1761. Sherman was appointed justice of the peace in 1762 and judge of the court of common pleas in 1765. During 1766, Sherman was first elected to the Governor&#x27;s Council of the Connecticut General Assembly, where he served until 1785. From 1784 to 1785, he also served as a judge of the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors. Sherman served as Justice of the Superior Court of Connecticut from 1766 to 1789.

Sherman was also appointed treasurer of Yale College, and awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree. He was a professor of religion for many years, and engaged in lengthy correspondences with some of the theologians of the time. During February 1776, Sherman, George Wythe, and John Adams were members of a committee responsible for establishing guidelines for U.S. Embassy officials in Canada with the committee instructions that included, &quot;You are to declare that we hold sacred the rights of conscience, and may promise to the whole people, solemnly in our name, the free and undisturbed exercise of their religion. And ... that all civil rights and the rights to hold office were to be extended to persons of any Christian denomination.&quot; In 1784, Sherman was elected mayor of New Haven, which office he held until his death.

===Continental and Confederation Congress===

As a member of the First Continental Congress, Sherman signed the Continental Association to impose an economic boycott on all British trade. In the Second Continental Congress, Sherman was appointed to the Committee of Five that drafted Declaration of Independence. Sherman was also a member of the committee of 13 that was responsible for preparing a draft constitution for the new nation. During debate, Sherman proposed a bicameral national legislature where states would be represented equally. The committee of 13 rejected Sherman&#x27;s proposal, adopting a unicameral legislature and what would become the Articles of Confederation. As a member of the Confederation Congress, Sherman was a signatory of the Treaty of Paris which ended the Revolutionary War.

===Constitutional Convention===
Sherman came into the Convention without the intention of creating a new constitution. He saw the convention as a means to modify the already existing government. Part of his stance was concerned with the public appeal. He defended amending the articles declaring that it was in the best interest of the people and the most probable way the people would accept changes to a constitution. &quot;The problem with the old government was not that it had acted foolishly or threatened anybody&#x27;s liberties, but that it had simply been unable to enforce its decrees.&quot; Sherman advanced the idea that the national government simply needed a way to raise revenue and regulate commerce.

Sherman&#x27;s views were heavily shaped by Connecticut&#x27;s position as a particularly isolationist state. Connecticut operated almost without much need from other states, using its own ports to trade with the West Indies instead of utilizing ports in Boston, and feared that &quot;...the mass of people lacked sufficient wisdom to govern themselves and thus wished no branch of the federal government to be elected directly by the people&quot;.

His views were also influenced by his personal beliefs and Puritan views. Sherman opposed slavery and used the issue as a tool for negotiation and alliance. He believed that slavery was already gradually being abolished and the trend was moving southward. Sherman saw that the issue of slavery could be one that threatened the success of the Constitutional Convention. Therefore, Sherman helped shape compromises that benefited the slave states in order to obtain unlikely allies from the Carolinas due to the economies of their home states.

Sherman is also known for his stance against paper money with his authoring of Article I, Section 10 of the United States Constitution and his later opposition to James Madison over the Bill of Rights. He believed that these amendments would diminish the role and power of the states over the people.

Mr. Wilson &amp; Mr. Sherman moved to insert after the words &quot;coin money&quot; the words &quot;nor emit bills of credit, nor make any thing but gold &amp; silver coin a tender in payment of debts&quot; making these prohibitions absolute, instead of making the measures allowable (as in the XIII art) with the consent of the Legislature of the U.S. ... Mr. Sherman thought this a favorable crisis for crushing paper money. If the consent of the Legislature could authorize emissions of it, the friends of paper money would make every exertion to get into the Legislature in order to license it.&quot;

Sherman also had very little interest in creating an executive branch with much authority. He suggested that no constitutional provision needed be made for the executive because it was &quot;nothing more than an institution for carrying the will of the Legislature into effect&quot;.

====Representation====
Two proposed options for the formation of the legislative branch emerged in the deliberations. One was to form a bicameral legislature in which both chambers had representation proportional to the population of the states, which was supported by the Virginia Plan. The second was to modify the unicameral legislature that had equal representation from all of the states, which was supported by the New Jersey Plan introduced by William Paterson that Sherman helped author. Sherman saw no reason for bicameralism. He defended the unicameral legislature of the Articles of Confederation by stating that the more populous states had not &quot;suffered at the hands of less populous states on account of the rule of equal voting&quot;. Sherman, Elbridge Gerry and others were of the shared opinion that the elected composition of the national government should be reserved for the vote of state officials and not for election by the will of the people. Sherman was wary of allowing ordinary citizen participation in national government and stated that the people &quot;should have as little to do as may be about the Government. They want information and are constantly liable to be misled&quot;.

While Sherman was a devout supporter of a unicameral legislature, he recognized that this goal was unattainable because it would not receive the support of the more populous states. With the aide of Oliver Ellsworth, Sherman repeatedly proposed a bicameral compromise where one house had representation proportional to the population, and the other had equal representation for the states. Some scholars have identified Sherman as a pivotal delegate at the Convention because of his role in settling the debate over representation. At important moments in the deliberations, Sherman consistently pushed the interests of the less populous states. When delegates were unable to reconcile the differences between his plan and Madison&#x27;s Virginia Plan, Sherman helped to get the issue of representation in Congress delegated to a Grand Committee of which he was not only a member but whose membership was sympathetic to the views of the less populous states.

The plan that emerged from the Grand Committee, originally introduced by Sherman, and which known as became the Connecticut Compromise, was designed to be acceptable to both the more and less populous states: the people would be represented proportionally in one branch of the legislature, called the House of Representatives (the lower legislative house). The states would be represented in another house called the Senate (the upper house). In the lower house, each state had a representative for every one delegate. In the upper house, each state was guaranteed two senators, regardless of its size. In terms of modes of election, Sherman supported allowing each state legislature to elect its own senators. In the House, Sherman originally proposed that the suffrage of the House should be figured according to the &quot;numbers of free inhabitants&quot; in each state.

===Later career===
Sherman was elected as a United States Representative in the First Congress, and then to the Senate in the Second and Third Congress until his death in 1793. In 1790 both Sherman and Richard Law were appointed to revise the confused and archaic Connecticut statutes, which they accomplished. Throughout his life, Sherman was a major benefactor of Yale College, acting as the university&#x27;s treasurer for many years and promoting construction of a college chapel.

Sherman opposed appointment of fellow signer Gouverneur Morris as minister to France because he considered that high-living Patriot to be of an &quot;irreligious nature&quot;.

==Death and burial site==
Sherman died in his sleep on July 23, 1793, after a two-month illness diagnosed as typhoid fever. The &quot;Gazette of the United States&quot; (Philadelphia), August 17, 1793, p. 508, reported an alternate diagnosis, &quot;He was taken ill about the middle of May last, and from that time declined till his death. His physician supposed his disorder to be seated in his liver.&quot; He was buried in New Haven Green. In 1821, when that cemetery was relocated, his remains were moved to the Grove Street Cemetery.

Jonathan Edwards Jr. gave a funeral sermon at the ceremony for Sherman on July 25, 1793. He praised his contributions to his friends, family, town, and country, noting Sherman&#x27;s piety and excellence in study.

==Legacy==

Sherman is especially notable in United States history for being the only person to sign all four great state papers of the United States, the Articles of Association, the United States Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the United States Constitution. Robert Morris, who did not sign the Articles of Association, signed the other three. John Dickinson also signed three, the Continental Association, the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution. He was involved with the Declaration of Independence but abstained, hoping for a reconciliation with Britain.

Sherman is one of the most influential members of the Constitutional Convention. He is not well known for his actions at the Convention because he was a &quot;terse, ineloquent speaker&quot; who never kept a personal record of his experience, unlike other prominent figures. At 66 years of age, Sherman was the second eldest member at the convention following Benjamin Franklin (who was 81 years old at the time). Yet he was a critical opponent of James Madison and the more populous states. Sherman was also one of the most active members of the convention, Sherman made motions or seconds 160 times (compared to Madison&#x27;s 177 times).

The town of Sherman, Connecticut was named for Roger Sherman. Sherman, as a member of the Committee of Five, is portrayed on the pediment of the Jefferson Memorial.
