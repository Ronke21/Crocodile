<text>Milton is a city in Rock County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 5,716 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The city was formed as a result of the 1967 merger of the villages of Milton and Milton Junction. In November of that year, ballots were cast by 1,093 voters from both villages (Milton: 515 to 47 in favor of the merge; Milton Junction: 322 to 201 in favor of the merge), and the referendum to merge the two was approved by 77%.

Originally named Prairie du Lac, Milton was settled in 1838 by Joseph Goodrich, who came from Alfred, New York with his family to the locality for religious and educational reasons. As soon as he moved he organized a Seventh Day Baptist Church in November 1840, and in 1844 a school that would later become a college. He also built an inn, a Milton House, without crossing two trade routes.

The Milton House is today one of the oldest poured grout structures in the United States. A noted abolitionist, Goodrich is known to have helped fugitive slaves escape to freedom via the Underground Railroad.

It is believed that Milton is named after poet John Milton, author of &quot;Paradise Lost,&quot; after a settler remarked that the town was his &quot;Paradise Regained&quot; after leaving his previous home, which he thought of as a paradise lost.

==Geography==

The academy progressed to the point of becoming a college in 1867. The college had clear connections with the US&#x27;s Seventh Day Baptist church, which offered them operational support. Milton native Albert Whitford, a graduate of the college, became a leading astronomer. Another alumnus, Dave Krieg, was an All-Pro quarterback with the Seattle Seahawks.

<text>Hawkins is a village in Rusk County in north-central Wisconsin, United States. The population was 305 at the 2010 census. The village is located within the Town of Hawkins.

==History==
Before the railroad came, the area around Hawkins was forested, cut by Main Creek and its tributaries, with swamp in the lowlands along those branches. In 1884 the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad (the Soo Line) built its line through the area, aiming to connect the grain of the Twin Cities with the shipping at Sault Ste. Marie. The railroad created a station near where it crossed the south fork of Main Creek, which became Hawkins.

The source of the name &quot;Hawkins&quot; is uncertain. The station was most likely named for Marsh P. Hawkins, who was the secretary and treasurer of the Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis division of the Minneapolis, St. Paul &amp; Sault Ste. Marie Railroad in the 1880s. Or it may have been named for a lumberman named Hawkins who owned land in the area. There is also a suggestion that the Norwegian settlers may have named the town for King Haakon of Norway.

An 1888 map of the township shows a siding and depot and a few other buildings north of the main rail line. It also shows a tote road along the south side of the railroad from the west, then on the east side of Hawkins turning south to head to the Jump River.

C.P. Crosby built the first sawmill in Hawkins in 1898. Other sawmills were added and the town grew, adding a store, a hotel, a boarding house, meat market, bank, hardware store, restaurants, and other businesses. Also added were a lath mill, a planing mill, a shingle mill, and a box factory that made piano crates, Cream of Wheat boxes, ammunition boxes, etc. Many of the businesses burned in the &#x27;20s and &#x27;30s, and most rebuilt. A 1914 map of Hawkins shows tidy blocks of residential lots with two churches, a school, and a rail spur arcing off into the yards of the Ellingson Lumber Co.

Early on the community had a small log school that accommodated 5 or 6 students. Another building was added in 1899, and in 1903 a 4-room, 2-story school was built. In 1916 Hawkins High School was built, and a graded elementary school was built in 1921.

In 1920 a cheese factory opened and the town began a burst of growth. In 1922 Northern Sash and Door opened. The plant burned in 1967, but rebuilt and eventually became Norco and now Jeld-Wen - the sole large manufacturer left in Hawkins.

In 1967 the Hawkins School District merged with Ladysmith and high school students were bussed from Hawkins to Ladysmith. In 2009 Hawkins detached from Ladysmith and joined the Flambeau district.

==Geography==
Hawkins is located at (45.512448, -90.713483).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

<text>Baraboo ( ) is the county seat of Sauk County, Wisconsin, United States, located along the Baraboo River. The population was 12,556 as of the 2020 census. The most populous city in the county, Baraboo is the principal city of the Baraboo micropolitan statistical area which comprises a portion of the Madison combined statistical area. 

Baraboo is home to the Circus World Museum and the former headquarters and winter home of the Ringling Brothers Circus. The Al. Ringling Theatre is an active landmark in the city. Baraboo is near Devil&#x27;s Lake State Park and Aldo Leopold&#x27;s Shack and Farm.

==History==

=== Early settlement ===
The area around Baraboo was the site of a Kickapoo village as early as 1665. The current community was established by Abe Wood in 1838, and was originally known as the village of Adams. In 1839 several settlers arrived and started building cabins, and a saw mill. In 1846 it became the county seat of Sauk County after a fierce fight with the nearby village of Reedsburg. In 1852, the village was renamed &quot;Baraboo&quot;, after the nearby river. It was incorporated as a village in 1866 and as a city in 1882. In the 1860s, the city had surpassed a population of 2,000, and many businesses started to form, including grocery stores, banks, and hotels. In 1872, the Chicago and North Western Railway (C&amp;NW) was built. Baraboo became home to several saw mills during this time, because of its location near the Baraboo and Wisconsin Rivers.

=== Late 1800s to present ===
In 1884, the Ringling Brothers Circus was established in Baraboo by circus performers and tourers the Ringling brothers, after they settled in the city in 1875 and performed their first show in Mazomanie, Wisconsin in 1882. Several other circuses then came to the city, which earned Baraboo the nickname &quot;Circus City&quot;.

Located south of Baraboo in the Census-designated place of Bluffview, was the Badger Ordnance Works, which was the largest munitions factory in the world during World War II. It was later demolished and now the land is a part of the Sauk Prairie Recreation Area.

Hank Snow&#x27;s 1959 song &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Everywhere&quot;, famously covered by Johnny Cash, mentions visiting Baraboo.

Cirrus, a manufacturer of single-engine aircraft, was founded in a rural Baraboo barn in 1984 by the Klapmeier brothers. After a few years of designing the VK-30, they relocated to the Baraboo–Dells Airport and in 1994 moved the company to its present-day home in Duluth, Minnesota.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

West Baraboo, a suburb of Baraboo, borders the city on its west side.

Baraboo gives its name to the Baraboo Syncline, a doubly plunging, asymmetric syncline in Proterozoic-aged Baraboo quartzite. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin, particularly Charles R. Van Hise, used the syncline to demonstrate that small-scale deformational structures in isolated outcrops reflect larger regional structures and that sedimentary structures could indicate the original top-facing direction within elaborately deformed strata. These two principles sparked a global revolution in structural geology during the 1920s.

The nearby Baraboo Hills are designated one of the &quot;Last Great Places&quot; by the Nature Conservancy because of its rare rocks, plants and animals. The hills were created by glacial action, and in some points poke up from the flat terrain to form a stark contrast. Some of these features were created when a glacial pocket was formed during the Wisconsin glaciation where the advance of the glacier halted, along the edge of what is known as the Driftless Area. Devil&#x27;s Lake State Park, Wisconsin&#x27;s largest state park, contains large areas of the Baraboo Hills. Pewits Nest is located outside Baraboo.

=== Climate ===

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Baraboo has a warm-summer humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps. The hottest temperature recorded in Baraboo was on July 5–7, 2012, while the coldest temperature recorded was on January 30, 1951.

Koroknay-Palicz was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and grew up in Holland, Michigan. By high school, he began to articulate that inequality in terms of ageism and wrote articles for his school newspaper on the subject. Senior year at Holland High School, Koroknay-Palicz discovered several local businesses with policies limiting the number of students allowed inside at any one time. Recognizing these policies as ageism, he decided to do something about it. After much research he learned these policies were illegal under Michigan&#x27;s Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act. Koroknay-Palicz demanded the city to enforce this law at a speech before a Holland city council meeting. The matter was referred to Al Serrano in the city&#x27;s Human Rights Department, who succeeded in overturning the policies at all the stores in question.

Koroknay-Palicz serves on the board of advisors for the Freechild Project. His writing appears in several publications and websites. In 2006 Koroknay-Palicz joined the Board of Directors of CAFETY.

Koroknay-Palicz and Robert Epstein co-founded the First Annual National Youth Rights Day which occurred on April 14, 2010 Epstein wrote The Young Person&#x27;s Bill of Rights for this event.

Koroknay-Palicz currently lives in Takoma Park, Maryland and served on the city&#x27;s voting rights taskforce after Takoma Park became the first city in the United States to lower its voting age to 16. Testified in support of successful 16-year-old voting age bills in Takoma Park and Hyattsville, Maryland. He currently works for the National Association of Counties and in October 2014 married Tricia Gonwa.

<text>Reedsburg is a city in Sauk County, Wisconsin, United States, within the Baraboo micropolitan area. Its population in 2020 was 9,984. The city is surrounded by the Town of Reedsburg and is situated along the Baraboo River.

Prior to the arrival of non-indigenous people in the 19th century, the region was home to groups of Ho-Chunk. Established as a village in 1868, the community was named after early settler David C. Reed.

== History ==

=== Early settlement ===
Early settlers came to this area due to the abundance of natural resources, especially lumber. In 1844, the first copper mine was established in this area, but it was soon abandoned. James W. Babb and his wife Rebecca Scarff Babb are the earliest recorded settlers, having brought their family to Wisconsin from Ohio in 1845. At a place 55 miles northeast of Mineral Point (the capital of Wisconsin Territory), long identified by the Winnebago who inhabited these lands as a convenient place to cross the Baraboo River, Babb left a flat-bottomed boat to help move supplies.

At &quot;Babb&#x27;s Ford,&quot; in 1847 David C. Reed built a dam and a shanty to house the workers who constructed it. In June 1848 a sawmill followed. By 1850, &quot;Shanty Row&quot; comprised five tamarack shanties. These initial buildings were of poor construction, and did not have a strong foundation, due to the black-alder swamp by the Baraboo River. Main Street would later be built where &quot;Shanty Row&quot; stood.

Reedsburg was platted in 1852, and four years later the community had grown to 50 buildings housing 27 families and 122 people. The first bridge across the Baraboo River was built in 1853, located where the Main Street bridge would later be built. In 1854 the Mackey brothers purchased Reed&#x27;s saw mill, and brought economic security to the area. As the town was growing, more farms continued to be developed around the area, cultivating a variety of crops.

=== Late 1800s ===
The community continued under town government until 1868, when Reedsburg was incorporated as a village; it became a city in May 1887. In the 1860s, a hop boom temporarily brought wealth into the area. After the crash of the hops market, more farms started to diversify, and Reedsburg would become known for its grain and dairy products. The Chicago &amp; North Western Railway (C&amp;NW) arrived in 1872.

In the 1870s, Main Street started to develop, with grocery stores, banks, and other businesses establishing in Reedsburg. In 1880, the Reedsburg Brewing Company was formed. As the city continued to grow, more industries came to Reedsburg. On December 1, 1883, the Webb and Schweke department store opened, known as the &quot;Big Store&quot;. The store would go on to be the largest department store in Sauk County. The City Hotel opened in 1886, owned by William Roper. Among the most important was the Reedsburg Woolen Mill. Construction was completed in 1882, and by 1899, 32 broad looms produced mainly &quot;fancy cassimeres&quot; for Chicago markets. 
=== 1900s ===
In 1902 the facility was purchased by Appleton Woolen Mills, and began producing clothing for east coast outlets. Sears and Montgomery Wards became two major clients. In 1910, the Central Wisconsin Creamery opened, making Reedsburg famous for its butter production. In 1954, when Appleton Woolen Mills shifted focus to felts, the business in Reedsburg reorganized to emphasize novelty fabrics. The Big Store burned down in 1957, after 78 years of service. The Reedsburg Woolen Mill, long one of the area&#x27;s largest employers, endured until 1967; most of the mill complex burned in April 1968, leaving only the mill office.

In 1951, Herbert Webb left Reedsburg a $300,000 trust fund, which is equivalent to over 4 million dollars, adjusted for inflation. He also set aside funding for Webb Park and Webb High School on the northeast side of Reedsburg, before his death in 1954.

Another important business has been the Hankscraft Company. Incorporated in Madison in 1920, Hankscraft—makers of baby bottle warmers, sterilizers and other products—thrived during the post-war baby boom, and in 1949 opened a plant in Reedsburg. In 1961, Hankscraft purchased Nursmatic Corporation, expanding their line to include bassinets, safety harnesses, baby toiletries and other products; a year later, the acquisition of Ruzicka Laboratories allowed the firm to expand once more, adding vaporizer fluids, baby oil, shampoo and lotions. In 1970, Hankscraft was purchased by Gerber Products Company, and began producing baby food. It was the town&#x27;s second largest employer, exceeded only by the Reedsburg Woolen Mill.

In the 1980s, the Wisconsin and Southern Railroad came to Reedsburg, having purchased the old C&amp;NW railroad track. In 1996, Gerber Products Company sold Hankscraft Motors, which continues to operate in Reedsburg. Other important industries have included Grede Foundry, Seats, Inc., and the Columbia Par Car Corporation.

In 1971, the first Butter Festival, now known as Butterfest, was held in Webb Park. It was a celebration of the farming and dairy industry. In 1984, together the Main Street Commercial Historic District and the Park Street Historic District were added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 1993, 22 miles of the C&amp;NW rail line between Reedsburg and Elroy became the Wisconsin 400 State Trail, a hiking/biking trail named for the passenger rail line that was said to travel the 400 miles between Chicago and Minneapolis/St. Paul in 400 minutes.

=== 2000s ===
Fermentation Fest, an annual celebration of Reedsburg&#x27;s agricultural heritage, was established in 2010. As part of the movement in 2014, Harvest Park was created as a downtown park featuring &quot;Ruminant&quot;, a decorated piece of farm equipment, as a permanent installation.

The Baraboo River flooded in both 2008 and 2018, destroying several homes and businesses. As a result of the flooding, two new parks were created – Mackey Park and the Community Market.

==Relationship with Frank Lloyd Wright==

The world-renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright was born in nearby Richland Center, Wisconsin, studied in Madison, Wisconsin, and spent summers and other times near Spring Green with his mother&#x27;s family, the Lloyd-Joneses of Wyoming Valley. He became identified with Spring Green when he built the first Taliesin studio nearby in 1911 after leaving Oak Park, Illinois, to live with Mamah Borthwick, the wife of an erstwhile client. The disapproval of many area residents only intensified after a disastrous fire and the murder of Borthwick along with her children and several workmen in 1914. On the other hand, some Spring Green craftsmen were among Wright&#x27;s most trusted and lifelong favorites.

Taliesin was rebuilt again in 1925 and became a local landmark. Wright was buried in the Lloyd-Jones family cemetery next to Unity Chapel near Taliesin and Spring Green from his death in 1959 until 1985, when his remains were controversially reinterred at Taliesin West in Arizona. Growing worldwide appreciation of Wright&#x27;s legacy has brought increased attention as well as tourism to the Spring Green area. Architects from the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, along with Wright-trained architects native to Wisconsin, have designed numerous homes and commercial and civic buildings in Spring Green and the surrounding area.

<text>Hayward is a city in Sawyer County, Wisconsin, United States, next to the Namekagon River. Its population was 2,533 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Sawyer County. The city is surrounded by the Town of Hayward. The City of Hayward was formally organized in 1883.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Before logging, the area that would become Hayward was a forest of pine and hardwoods cut by rivers and lakes. In later years Ojibwe people dominated the area along with much of northern Wisconsin, until the 1837 Treaty of St. Peters, when they ceded it to the U.S.

Logging along the Namekagon River had begun by 1864, when government surveyors noted that T. Mackey had a logging camp on the river at what would become Hayward. In the winter of 1878 Anthony Judson Hayward walked up on the ice, assessed mill sites and timber possibilities upstream, and decided to build a lumber mill. Until 1880 the spot was connected to the outside world only by river or logging tote roads, but in that year the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway built its tracks through, connecting it to the Twin Cities and Chicago, and making Anthony Hayward&#x27;s sawmill plan much more lucrative. He found financial backing and a partner in Robert Laird McCormick and managed to buy the last parcels of land for his sawmill in 1881. Their North Wisconsin Lumber Company dammed the river at the site of the current Hayward dam and built a sawmill, shingle mill, and planing mill to the north, called by 1883 &quot;the Big Mill.&quot;

That same year the village of Hayward was platted and Sawyer County was established, formed from parts of early versions of Chippewa and Ashland Counties. The village of Hayward was designated its county seat.

The mill town and county seat grew. By 1897 &quot;2,000 souls&quot; lived in the village, with 120 men working in the mill. Around that time the mill produced each year about 40 million feet of lumber, 10 million lath, and 4 million shingles, and the whole mill with drying yards covered forty acres. The village had a school, four churches, a bank, a free library, a fire company, and &quot;nearly every Secret Society known to man.&quot; The village had electricity and a water works. Four blocks of the village streets were paved with brick.

In the surrounding country, settlers were beginning to wrest little farms out of the stump-lands cut off by the loggers. In 1896 it was reported that 432 bushels of corn were produced in Sawyer County, 610 bushels of barley, 14,516 bushels of oats, 380 bushels of rye, 1,125 tons of hay, 12,417 tons of potatoes, 3,065 bushels of non-potato root crops, and 6,500 pounds of butter. The same summary noted that dairy farming was rapidly increasing in the area.

Steady logging eventually depleted most of the pine, and then many of the hardwoods. The Big Mill at Hayward burned in 1922 and was not rebuilt. Logging on a smaller scale has continued ever since, along with agriculture. Meanwhile, tourism has become more and more important.

=== Hayward Indian Residential School ===
In 1901, the Hayward Indian Residential School was established in Hayward. It was founded to assimilate indigenous children into white Christian American culture. Most of the students were Ojibwe and came from the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation ten miles away from the school. The school operated until 1934, when it closed due to being understaffed, underfunded, and overcrowded. During its operation, thousands of students passed through the school. Some were taken forcibly from their families. At the school, children were forced to take on Christian names, cut their hair, wear military style uniforms, and march in military formations. Boys and girls were strictly segregated in separate buildings.

The curriculum focused on English language, Christian religion, and industrial labor. Provision of teachers was so poor that few students graduated, and graduation certificates were withheld from students who were thought likely to return to their reservations instead of assimilating into white society. The school was funded in part by the government and in part by the labor of the children in agriculture and sewing. Male children cleared over 260 acres for cultivation. Girls were trained as housewives and lived in the &quot;Homestead Cottage&quot;, where a female teacher taught them how to run a household. The girls sold their sewing products to support the school and prepared meals for the other students. In the first decade of the school&#x27;s operation, girls were encouraged to practice Native beadwork styles, but by 1910, this had been discontinued.

Overcrowding and poor sanitation endangered the students&#x27; health. Dishes were rarely cleaned, students slept two to a bed, and during the winter, they crowded into small rooms for indoor activities because the school had no gymnasium. Children were served moldy bread, and most of the milk the children produced from the dairy herd was sold rather than fed to the children. These poor health conditions led to high rates of disease. The death rate during the 1918 flu pandemic was 10 times higher than the Wisconsin average. Students also died from epidemics of measles and pneumonia. Some students were sexually abused by the teachers.

For speaking their Native languages, students were punished with beatings, public humiliation, extra chores, and confinement in the school jail. The school jail was a cell with bars in the basement of the boy&#x27;s dormitory, where children were fed only bread and water. Other students were punished by being forced to kneel on marbles for hours. Hayward students sometimes went out into the woods on the weekends and spoke Ojibwe together since it was forbidden in school. On one occasion, a secret drum dance was held, where students prepared by secretly sewing jingles onto their dresses and practicing their singing at night. The superintendents caught the students and punished them by burning their drums, hitting their knuckles, and forcing the girls to wear signs around their necks reading, &quot;I will not squaw dance&quot;. Due to the poor conditions and harsh discipline, runaways were common; in 1920 alone, 69 children ran away from the school. In 2024, the Department of the Interior released a report that stated three students who died during their time at the school had been identified.

The school closed in 1934 and was converted to the Hayward Area Memorial Hospital.

<text>Wittenberg is a village in Shawano County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,081 at the 2010 census. The village is located within the Town of Wittenberg.

==History==
In 1886, the Wittenberg Indian School was established by the Norwegian Evangelical Church of America after a purchase of land in Winnebago traditional territory. This was a residential school for Native American children who the government removed from their families as part of an effort to assimilate Native Americans into white American culture. It was also known as the Bethany Indian Mission. Initial attempts to recruit students for the school were met with resistance, particularly from Winnebago &quot;medicine men&quot; who the missionaries believed were concerned about their intention to convert the children to Christianity. The school initially only taught a few children but eventually expanded to include over a hundred students who came from the Winnebago, Oneida, Stockbridge, Brothertown, Menominee, Mohawk and Chippewa. The school was sold to the government in 1900 and operated until 1917, when it was closed because of the First World War. After the closure of the federal school, the mission continued educating Native children, eventually educating up to 140 students with only four members of staff, as well as baptizing hundreds of local Native people. The high student to staff ratio was typical of overcrowded Indian schools, as documented by the Merriam Report.

A post office called Wittenberg has been in operation since 1880. The village was named after Wittenberg in Germany.

It is included in the Sheboygan, Wisconsin metropolitan area. The city is located in the Town of Plymouth, but is politically independent. Plymouth was known as &quot;Hub City&quot; for its former role as a center of wooden wheelwrighting.

==History==
Plymouth was surveyed in 1835 by United States engineers, one of whom was named Mullet, and the Mullet river was subsequently named after him. The first land sold to a private party was sold to an Englishman named John Law who had emigrated from London. It was sold to Law on August 13, 1836. The next sale was to another Englishman, also from London, named Thomas Margrave. Settlers continued trickling in and the town was organized on April 3, 1849. In the 1840s a group of migrants arrived from Tioga County, Pennsylvania. Their ancestors had moved to that area from New England shortly after the American Revolution. The Thorpe family arrived from Hartford, Connecticut. They were of old New England ancestry. These migrants being the original pool of settlers in Plymouth gave the region cultural continuity with New England. The town was named Plymouth, after Plymouth, Massachusetts, where the Pilgrims had landed in 1620.

Originally known by early Native Americans as Quit Qui Oc, or Crooked River, Plymouth was settled in 1845 by Isaac Thorp and incorporated in 1877. The city is often called &quot;Hub City&quot; because of its central location within Sheboygan County, but the nickname &quot;Hub City&quot; began in the 1860s when the Schwartz brothers had a wagon shop where they made wagons, hubs and spokes.

<text>Sheboygan is a town in Sheboygan County, Wisconsin, known as the Town of Sheboygan to differentiate from the county and city of Sheboygan. The population was 8,136 according to the 2020 Census. It is included in the Sheboygan, Wisconsin Metropolitan Statistical Area. This separate municipality is located north and west of the city of Sheboygan, with varying boundaries along the city and village lines of Sheboygan and Kohler, including enclaves of homes connected to the town by inches-long lines of property.

The town of Sheboygan has at various times started to take action to acquire village status in order to fend off annexation attempts by the city, but efforts have been unsuccessful thus far.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 11.0 square miles (28.6 km2), of which, 11.0 square miles (28.5 km2) of it is land and 0.04 square miles (0.1 km2) of it (0.36%) is water.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 5,874 people, 2,148 households, and 1,724 families residing in the town. The population density was 534.5 people per square mile (206.4/km2). There were 2,245 housing units at an average density of 204.3 per square mile (78.9/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 96.12% White, 0.12% Black or African American, 0.15% Native American, 2.47% Asian, 0.54% from other races, and 0.60% from two or more races. 1.16% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 2,148 households, out of which 38.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 73.9% were married couples living together, 3.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 19.7% were non-families. 15.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.73 and the average family size was 3.07.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 27.8% under the age of 18, 5.3% from 18 to 24, 30.9% from 25 to 44, 26.5% from 45 to 64, and 9.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 104.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 102.0 males.

Law enforcement services are provided by the Sheboygan County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. Part-time Code Enforcement Officers are employed to address parking and ordinance concerns.

== Education ==
The Sheboygan Area School District operates Lincoln-Erdman Elementary School and Lake Country Academy within the Town of Sheboygan.
== Economy and growth ==

Although Sam&#x27;s Club announced the building of a 137,000 square-foot store in 2014 on the former site of an older Menards store, after years of delays, Town of Sheboygan officials confirmed that the construction would not be moving forward, though Walmart continues to own the vacant land as of 2022. The Sheboygan Senior Community built a new facility on County Road Y and relocated from downtown Sheboygan in late 2015.

The town moved its town hall in December 2020 from its former cramped building at North 40th Street and Superior Avenue to an existing building in the Erdman area, as it became clear during the pandemic that it could not operate meetings or elections out of it to allow social distancing, and to address longstanding accessibility concerns.

<text>Sheboygan () is a city in and the county seat of Sheboygan County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 49,929 at the 2020 census. It is the principal city of the Sheboygan metropolitan area, which has a population of 118,034. The city is located on the western shore of Lake Michigan at the mouth of the Sheboygan River, about north of Milwaukee and south of Green Bay.

==History==

Before its settlement by European Americans, the Sheboygan area was home to Native Americans, including members of the Potawatomi, Chippewa, Ottawa, Winnebago, and Menominee tribes. In the Menominee language, the place is known as &quot;Sāpīwǣhekaneh,&quot; &quot;at a hearing distance in the woods&quot;. The Menominee ceded this land to the United States in the 1831 Treaty of Washington. Following the treaty, the land became available for sale to American settlers. Migrants from New York, Michigan, and New England were among the first new Americans to settle this area in the 1830s, though the French had been present in the region since the 17th century and had intermarried with local people. One 19th century settler remarked: &quot;Nearly all the settlers were from the New England states and New York.&quot; Lumbering was the first major industry, as trees were harvested and shipped to eastern markets through the Great Lakes.

Although Sheboygan was officially incorporated in 1846, much of the town had been platted in 1836, when property investors laid out more than one thousand lots.

By 1849, a wave of liberal, middle-class immigration triggered by the revolutions of 1848 had made the community known for its German population. As Major William Williams wrote on June 26, 1849: &quot;Arrived at Sheboigin on the Wisconsin side, a small town, population purhaps from 700 to 1000. This is a promising place. There are a great many best class of Germans settling around it. &#x27;Tis all along this Lake so far quite an interesting country.&quot; Between 1840 and 1890, Protestant Dutch immigrants also settled in the area, as did Irish refugees fleeing the Great Famine. A neighborhood in northwestern Sheboygan (between Martin Avenue and Alexander Court) was settled by Slovenian immigrants and acquired the name &quot;Laibach&quot;; it was also known as &quot;Vollrath&#x27;s Division&quot;. According to a local Optimist member&#x27;s account in 1963, in 1887 Sheboygan adopted a sundown town ordinance, banning African Americans from living there, though city leaders denied that any such ordinance was in effect.

In the spring of 1898, Sheboygan elected Fred C. Haack and August L. Mohr as aldermen, making them the first two Social Democratic Party candidates to be elected to public office in the United States. Haack had originally been elected in 1897 as a member of the Populist Party but joined the Social Democrats after they organized locally. Haack served as alderman for sixteen years before moving to Milwaukee and being elected as a Socialist alderman there. At the 
1932 Socialist Party convention, Haack received recognition as the first Socialist officeholder in America.

In the early 20th century, many Orthodox Greeks, Catholic Slavs and Lithuanians immigrated to Sheboygan. In the late 20th century, Hmong refugees from Laos and Southeast Asia settled there.

Civil and criminal law cases are heard in the Sheboygan County Circuit Court, with municipal citations for Sheboygan and Kohler handled through the city&#x27;s municipal court within the police headquarters building. The Sheboygan Fire Department provides fire suppression and emergency medical services, operating out of five fire stations throughout the city.

===State and federal representation===
Sheboygan is represented in the Wisconsin State Assembly as part of both the 26th (Terry Katsma, R–Oostburg) and 27th (Tyler Vorpagel, R–Plymouth) districts, whose boundaries split the city along Geele Avenue from the west until North 18th Street, then Superior Avenue from North 18th Street to Lake Michigan. The city is also represented in the State Senate as part of the 9th district (Devin LeMahieu, R–Oostburg).

Sheboygan is in the 6th congressional district of Wisconsin, which is represented by Republican congressman Glenn Grothman.

==Education==

Sheboygan public schools are administered by the Sheboygan Area School District.

* Sheboygan South High School
* Sheboygan Area Lutheran High School
* Sheboygan County Christian High School
* George D. Warriner High School

* University of Wisconsin–Green Bay Sheboygan Campus
* Lakeshore Technical College (satellite campus)

==Media==
The city&#x27;s daily newspaper is Gannett&#x27;s &quot;The Sheboygan Press&quot;, which has been published since 1907. The &quot;Sheboygan Sun&quot; also provides local news coverage through its website, while the &quot;Beacon&quot; is published by the same company as &quot;The Plymouth Review&quot; and &quot;Sheboygan Falls News&quot;; the latter two have print editions mailed out weekly to all residents. The Gannett-owned &quot;Shoreline Chronicle&quot; contains Press &quot;best-of&quot; content, and is door-delivered and is also distributed with the Wednesday &quot;Press&quot;.

The city is served by television and radio stations in Green Bay and Milwaukee. Nielsen&#x27;s television division places Sheboygan within the Milwaukee market, although Green Bay stations also report news, events, and weather warnings pertaining to Sheboygan and target the city with advertising.

Nielsen Audio places Sheboygan and Sheboygan County within one radio market, and several stations serve the area. Midwest Communications owns four stations within the county, including talk station WHBL (1330, with a translator station at 101.5 FM serving Sheboygan, Kohler and Sheboygan Falls); country station WBFM (93.7); CHR/Top 40 WXER (104.5 from Plymouth, with a translator at 96.1 FM in Sheboygan); and active rock Sheboygan Falls-licensed WHBZ (106.5). Another CHR station, WCLB (950, translated on 107.3) also serves the city, along with the Sheboygan Area School District&#x27;s WSHS (91.7), a member of the Wisconsin Public Radio Ideas Network, and Plymouth&#x27;s WGXI (1420, translated on 98.5), a classic country station.

Various religious stations originating from Milwaukee and north of Green Bay and a translator for Kiel&#x27;s WSTM (91.3), and NOAA Weather Radio station WWG91 broadcast from several towers in the city. WYVM acts as a full-power relay of Suring&#x27;s WRVN (102.7), which has a religious teaching format.

The city is served by Spectrum and U-verse, with public-access television cable TV programming provided to both systems from &quot;WSCS&quot;, and &quot;SASD-TV&quot; features school board meetings, with both channels featuring meetings and other content through their websites and YouTube. The city at one time had a television station, WPVS-LP, which went off the air following the digital switchover and has since moved to Milwaukee; WHBL also attempted to establish a television sister station several times, without success.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

====Roads====
Interstate 43 is the primary north-south transportation route into Sheboygan, and forms the west boundary of the city. U.S. Route 141 was the primary north-south route into Sheboygan before Interstate 43 was built, and its former route is a major north-south route through the center of the city that is referred to as Calumet Drive coming into the city from the north, and South Business Drive/Sauk Trail Road from the south; between Superior and Georgia Avenues within the city&#x27;s original plat, the highway is known as 14th Street. Four-lane Highway 23 is the primary west route into the city, and leads into the city up to North 25th Street as a freeway as Kohler Memorial Drive. Other state highways in the city include Highway 42, Highway 28, which both run mostly along the former inner-city routing of U.S. 141. Secondary county highways include County Trunk Highway DL (CTH-DL) and the decommissioned CTH-LS to the north; CTH-J, CTH-O, CTH-PP, and CTH-EE to the west; and CTH-KK to the south.

For addressing purposes, the city&#x27;s north-south zero point is Pennsylvania Avenue (increasing from 500 past that line in both directions), while west addressing zeroes out at the extreme eastern point of Superior Avenue at Lake Michigan (Sheboygan and Sheboygan County have no east addresses, and the little land existing northeast of that point stretches out the six &#x27;100 blocks&#x27; eastward with x50-x90 numbers not otherwise used in most other addresses in Sheboygan).

====Public transit====
Shoreline Metro provides public bus transit throughout the city, as well as in Kohler and Sheboygan Falls. All routes depart from the Metro Center, more commonly known as the &quot;Transfer Point&quot; located in the downtown.

Jefferson Lines and Indian Trails serve Sheboygan at the Metro Center, providing transportation to Milwaukee (and an Amtrak Thruway connection to the Milwaukee Intermodal Station) and Green Bay.

====Rail====
Historically the city was connected to Milwaukee, Chicago and Green Bay via the Milwaukee Interurban Lines, the Chicago &amp; North Western Railroad and the Milwaukee Road. These railroads&#x27; passenger services were abandoned during the mid-20th century but in 2008 the Wisconsin Department of Transportation proposed to reestablish passenger service to Milwaukee and Green Bay via Fond du Lac and the cities along Lake Winnebago&#x27;s west shore, though political complications in the 2010s have since mothballed rail expansion in Wisconsin.

====Airport====
Sheboygan is served by the county-owned non-commercial Sheboygan County Memorial Airport (KSBM) three miles northwest of the city.

====Water====
Sheboygan is bounded on the east by Lake Michigan. The city has no active port in the 21st century. Blue Harbor Resort is located on a peninsula between the lake and the Sheboygan River&#x27;s last bend. This site was formerly used as the headquarters of the C. Reiss Coal Company (now a Koch Industries division). It was their base of operations for ships to load and unload coal for delivery along the peninsula.

The Sheboygan River passes through the city, but dams in Sheboygan Falls prevent navigation upriver. Tall-masted boats are confined to the river downstream of the Pennsylvania Avenue bridge. Commercial charter fishing boats dock near the mouth of the river.

===Hospitals===
Two hospitals serve the city. Aurora Medical Center - Sheboygan County opened in July 2022 under Aurora Health Care. St. Nicholas Hospital operates as part of the Hospital Sisters Health System.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
The City of Sheboygan Falls is located along State Highways 23, 28, and 32. The free-way style four-lane Highway 23 connects the community with Interstate 43 located less than five miles east of Sheboygan Falls.

A single-track railroad branch line between Plymouth and Sheboygan runs through the city. Built by the Chicago &amp; North Western (C&amp;NW) Railroad, the track originally paralleled the electric interurban Wisconsin Power &amp; Light line which terminated at Elkhart Lake. In later years it was primarily a freight line for the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company, and Union Pacific after UP acquired the C&amp;NW in 1995. In 2006, citing low demand and degraded infrastructure, Union Pacific announced plans to abandon the line west of the Kohler Company factory in Kohler, thus terminating all service to Sheboygan Falls. In 2009, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation purchased the Plymouth-Sheboygan Falls portion of the line from Union Pacific, with the intent of repairing the long dormant line to allow the Wisconsin &amp; Southern Railroad to provide restored service to Sheboygan Falls.

The track through downtown Sheboygan Falls has been of interest to railfans because of a number of interesting features, including an iron trestle over the Sheboygan River, a small section of street running where the line runs at grade along city streets, and antiquated &quot;wig-wag&quot; signals at several crossings. Many of these features have been threatened because of the Union Pacific&#x27;s abandonment of the line; the trestle has been barricaded and parts of the tracks leading to it have been removed, and plans to restore the line for the resumption of service will require crossing signals to be upgraded. Wig wag signals have already been removed.

Sheboygan Falls is served by the Sheboygan County Memorial Airport (KSBM), which is located several miles north of the city. KSBM is the 7th busiest airport in Wisconsin with no commercial travel. The 700+ daily flight operations are primarily travel for business and pleasure, with its heaviest use from the Kohler Company, along with events at Road America and Whistling Straits. KSBM is capable of landing a 98,000 lbs. aircraft or a Boeing 737 with the longest concrete runway 6,800 feet long. The airport has fixed base operator with several private, industrial and commercial lots available for development. Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport (KMKE) is 64 mi away from Sheboygan Falls.

<text>Hudson is a city in and the county seat of St. Croix County, Wisconsin, United States. As of the 2020 census, its population was 14,755. It is part of the Minneapolis–St. Paul metropolitan area.

==History==
Several Native American burial mounds dated to the Middle or Late Woodland period have been found in what is now Birkmose Park in Hudson. Hudson was settled in 1840 by Louis Massey and his brother in-law, Peter Bouchea. William Streets arrived at about the same time. Later that year, Joseph Sauperson (commonly known as Joe LaGrue) took up residence. These four are considered Hudson&#x27;s original inhabitants. Massey and Bouchea settled at the mouth of the Willow River, near the present-day First and St. Croix Streets. They had been part of a group that lived for some time along the river below Fort Snelling, which appears on some old maps as &quot;Massey&#x27;s Landing&quot;.

Hudson was originally called &quot;Willow River&quot;. It was later named Buena Vista by Judge Joel Foster, founder of River Falls, after returning from the Mexican War where he fought in the Battle of Buena Vista. In 1852, Alfred D. Gray, Hudson&#x27;s first mayor, petitioned to change the city&#x27;s name to Hudson, because the bluffs along the St. Croix River reminded him of the Hudson River in his native New York.

A large number of settlers arrived in the 1850s and 1860s, many of whom were ancestors of today&#x27;s residents. The lumber industry was the area&#x27;s prime attraction, and over time sawmills were established throughout the St. Croix Valley.

The Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway was formed in 1881 from other railroads building between the Twin Cities and Chicago. The shops and headquarters of the Omaha Road were in Hudson. This route is now part of the Union Pacific Railroad.

On August 30, 1917, a violent mob of 1,000 held a night rally in front of the armory protesting the pacifist People&#x27;s Council of America&#x27;s attempt to hold a conference in Hudson&#x27;s prizefighting arena. The crowd then moved on the four organizers in the lobby of their hotel and threatened to hang them. Only after the pleadings of county attorney N. O. Varnum were the four allowed to leave town at once and unharmed.

U.S. Highway 12 once crossed the St. Croix River on a toll bridge between Wisconsin and Minnesota, which provided revenue for the town. With the construction of Interstate 94, the toll bridge was removed, though the long causeway extending to the former bridge location is now open to the public as a pedestrian walkway, known as &quot;The Dike&quot;.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water.

Interstate Highway 94, U.S. Route 12 and Wisconsin Highway 35 are three of the main routes in the community.

<text>Somerset is a village in St. Croix County, Wisconsin, along the Apple River. The population was 2,635 at the 2010 census. The village is located within the Town of Somerset.

==History==
Somerset was named by General Samuel Harriman after his father&#x27;s home of Somerset, England. Somerset has a lengthy and colorful history. Before the turn of the century Somerset was bordered on the south by cranberry bogs. The terrain naturally lent itself to the production of cranberries as a result of the hilliness of the area, which is dotted with ponds, sloughs, swamps and bogs. These wet areas became of greater interest to the local population during Prohibition. These same low spots where water collected became ideal for collecting water for the production of moonshine (homemade alcoholic beverages). Indeed, Somerset already had a history of being a rough logging town, and it was only a natural progression to become the supplier of bootlegged alcohol to the twin cities of Saint Paul and Minneapolis. After Prohibition ended, the citizens of Somerset returned to the more humble activities of logging and farming.

<text>Medford is a town (seven by six mile rural municipality) in Taylor County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 2,216 at the 2000 census. The City of Medford lies mostly within the town boundaries.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 37.8 square miles (97.8 km2), of which, 37.7 square miles (97.6 km2) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.2 km2) of it (0.19%) is water.

==History==
The western edge of the six by seven mile rectangle that would become the town of Medford was first surveyed in 1847 by a crew working for the U.S. government. That west edge of the town is on the Fourth Principal Meridian, the first north-south line surveyed up through the forests of Wisconsin, from which all the towns, sections and forties are measured. In late 1861 a different crew of surveyors marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:
&quot;The Surface of this Township is rather(?) gently rolling or Level. Timber mostly Hemlock with (?) Birch (?) Sugar Fir(?) Spruce and White Pine. Soil 1st &amp; 2nd Rate and of good quality for agricultural purposes. The Township is well watered by numerous(?) Small Streams which flow in a Southerly direction.&quot;

The area around Medford remained largely forest until 1873, when the Wisconsin Central Railroad cleared a roadway south to north along the Black River, and laid its track heading for Ashland. It established a station on the river and called it Medford, starting the city. To finance this undertaking, the railroad was granted half the land for eighteen miles on either side of the track laid - generally the odd sections. The railroad platted the first section of the village of Medford in 1874. At least one sawmill was built in Medford that same year, and logging expanded in the surrounding country.

When Taylor County was formed in 1875, the town of Medford was six miles north to south same as today, but it spanned the full width of the county, including all modern towns from Aurora to Goodrich.

An 1880 map of this area shows roads of some sort heading out from Medford into the surrounding country. One road follows the course of modern Highway 64 east beyond the township to the county line and west to where it now tees with modern County E. Partial predecessors of Perkins St, Oriole Ave, and Highway 13 were in place - also predecessors of Allman Ave, Center Ave, and County E on the west side.

A map from 1900 shows the town filling in. More roads were in place, with settlers&#x27; homesteads sprinkled along them. 80 and 40 acres are the most common farm sizes. Rural schools were at the corner of what would become Perkinstown Avenue and Anderson Road, two on Center Avenue, one on the future 64 west of Medford, and one at Oriole Drive and Kummer Lane. A few large parcels without settlers are still north of Medford - some in odd sections still owned by the railroad.

The 1913 plat map shows more roads, more settlers, another rural school added two miles east of Medford on what would become 64. It has &quot;Fair Ground&quot; marked on the east side of Medford, and a new Medford Lumber Co railroad angles northwest from Medford, then turns due west towards Perkinstown.

==Demographics==

<text>Medford is a city and county seat of Taylor County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 4,349 at the 2020 census. The city is located mostly within the boundaries of the Town of Medford. 

==History==
Medford is located on historic Ojibwe forest land acquired by the United States in the 1837 Treaty of St. Peters. In 1864, the federal government authorized a grant of some of this land to subsidize railway construction through the area. The Wisconsin Central Railroad Company, controlled by Boston financier Gardner Colby, obtained the land grant and constructed the railroad in the 1870s. The railroad company and a local lumber milling company laid out the city of Medford in 1875 and sold lots for twenty-five dollars each. The railroad named the new settlement after Medford, Massachusetts, the hometown of a railroad official. Medford shipped over 1.5 million board feet of lumber by rail within a year of its establishment, and the area was soon clear cut for farming.

The Wisconsin Legislature organized Taylor County in 1875 and named Medford the county seat, leading to a dispute between the Wisconsin Central Railroad and the mill company over the location of the courthouse. The Taylor County Courthouse was ultimately constructed on land donated by the railroad company.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Medford hosted an annual Mink festival, celebrating the town&#x27;s claim to be the &quot;Mink capital of the world.&quot; Fur farms in the area make Taylor County a top mink producer in North America. During the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020, thousands of mink died of the virus after having contracted it from human workers.

<doc id="260707" wikidata="Q7322203" url="?curid=260707" title="Rib Lake (town), Wisconsin">
<text>Rib Lake is a town in Taylor County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 768 at the 2000 census. The village of Rib Lake is completely surrounded by the town.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 74.9 square miles (193.9 km2), of which 74.0 square miles (191.7 km2) is land and 0.9 square miles (2.2 km2) (1.14%) is water.

The northern part of the town of Rib Lake lies within the Perkinstown terminal moraine, a line of hills bulldozed by the last glacier. Interspersed through the choppy land are small glacial lakes and ice-walled lake plains. Most of the south-central part of the town has a soil called Merrill till which was laid down by a much earlier glacier, giving it time to flatten out. Some bottoms along the Big Rib River are filled sandy deposits washed out of the last glacier.

==History==
Most of the edges of the six by six squares that would become Rib Lake were surveyed in October 1861 by a crew working for the U.S. government. In early 1862, the same crew marked all the section corners in the township, walking through the woods and swamps, measuring with chain and compass. When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description for the six by six square that now contains the village of Rib Lake:
&quot;The Surface of this Township is generally rolling. Soil Fair 2nd Rate and good for agricultural purposes. Timber Hemlock Birch Sugar and White Pine of good quality. It is well watered by numerous Small Lakes and Streams of pure water.&quot;

Around 1873, the Wisconsin Central Railroad built its line just west of what would become Rib Lake, up through the forest that would become Medford and Westboro, heading for Ashland. To finance this undertaking, the railroad was granted half the land for eighteen miles on either side of the track laid - generally the odd-numbered sections.

When Taylor County was formed in 1875, the northern six miles of what would become Rib Lake was part of a larger Town of Westboro which spanned the county east to west. The southern three miles were part of a Town of Chelsea that also spanned the county. In 1885 Rib Lake was split off as its own town.

An 1880 map of the area shows only one road in what would become the town of Rib Lake - some sort of wagon road reaching east from Westboro 3.5 miles along the course of modern Rustic Road 1 to the north side of James Lake.

In 1881 J.J. Kennedy started the sawmill at Rib Lake, which sawed lumber from the surrounding country, and which established the village. Around 1883 the Wisconsin Central built a permanent spur line from north of Chelsea across the north end of Wellington Lake to the village of Rib Lake, to haul out products of the mill. Later, hemlock bark from the surrounding forests was another important early product, supplying the tannery in Rib Lake.

A map from around 1900 shows roads and settlers beginning to fill in parts of the township. By that time roads paralleled the railroad spur from Chelsea to the village of Rib Lake, and the road grid was already pretty complete for three miles west of Rib Lake. A wagon road followed most of the course of modern County C running north and south. A predecessor of modern Wilderness Avenue reached to north of Wood Lake. Another early road anticipated Berry Avenue. Another followed Zuther Avenue for several miles. Another followed the course of modern Rustic Road 1 and Berry Avenue across the north. Settlers&#x27; homesteads were sprinkled along all of these - thickest around the village of Rib Lake and none on the east end. Rural schools were marked at the modern intersection of Berry and County C, at Fawn Ave and Peche, and at C and Trout. J.J. Kennedy owned many large blocks wherever there weren&#x27;t settlers. The Wisconsin Central still owned large parts of some odd-numbered sections. Other large land-holders were Fayette Shaw of the tannery in Rib Lake, C. McCrossen in the northeast corner, and J.O. Frank in the south.

The 1911 plat map showed the roads extended, with more settlers along them. By this time a town hall had appeared at the future intersection of C and Wilderness Avenue, and the northern school had moved to the future corner of Berry and Highway 102. Another school had been added a mile west of Wood Lake. Two sawmills had appeared where Wood Creek crosses the predecessor of Trout Avenue, and the Konz Post Office had appeared where Trout now meets County C. The Wisconsin Central had sold more of its land. Other large landholders by this time were the Rib Lake Lumber Company, U.S. Leather, Medford Manufacturing Co., and Wausau Lumber Co. on the east end.

These maps also show the Soo Line&#x27;s extension of the Rib Lake spur, built in 1902 east out of Rib Lake for a few miles, then turning north-northeast, eventually reaching Spirit Falls. There it connected with the Tomahawk, Marinette and Western Railroad out of Tomahawk. Branching east off this permanent spur, the Rib Lake Lumber Company laid temporary spurs to their logging camps around Wood Lake, pulling up the spurs and relaying them to the next camps every few years. This continued until 1948, feeding logs to the sawmill in Rib Lake and hemlock bark to the tannery.

Rustic Road #1, a scenic drive that winds over hills and around lakes and Wisconsin&#x27;s first official Rustic Road, was dedicated in 1975.

==Demographics==
At the 2000 census, there were 768 people, 278 households and 212 families residing in the town. The population density was 10.4 per square mile (4.0/km2). There were 466 housing units at an average density of 6.3 per square mile (2.4/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 98.31% White, 0.13% Native American, 1.17% Asian, 0.13% from other races, and 0.26% from two or more races. 0.52% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 278 households, of which 33.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 66.9% were married couples living together, 6.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 23.4% were non-families. 20.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.66 and the average family size was 3.08.

27.2% of the population were under the age of 18, 5.9% from 18 to 24, 27.3% from 25 to 44, 23.2% from 45 to 64, and 16.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females, there were 116.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 110.2 males.

The median household income was $38,393, and the median family income was $43,295. Males had a median income of $29,250 versus $21,103 for females. The per capita income for the town was $15,641.

==History==
In 1881, J. J. Kennedy hauled sawmill machinery with oxen from the railroad at Chelsea to the bank of Rib Lake and built a sawmill called the Rib Lake Lumber Company. The next year a railroad spur was built to the mill from the Wisconsin Central Railway at Chelsea. The community was originally called Kennedy Mills. The original mill burned in about a year, (and possibly burned again in 1898) and was destroyed by another fire on July 23, 1914.

In 1891, Fayette Shaw started a tannery in Rib Lake, which used tannic acid from locally harvested hemlock bark to tan hides from as far away as South America to make leather. The tannery operated until 1923.

The 1890s saw much growth, with the beginning of Methodist, Catholic and Lutheran congregations. In 1897 the Rib Lake Herald newspaper began publishing and a Dr. Werner started a practice.

The village of Rib Lake was incorporated in 1902.

The last pine cut for the Rib Lake Lumber Company came from a general location near the last camp #28, and was cut on February 26, 1948. The company ceased operations shortly thereafter.

<text>Trempealeau ( ) is a village located along the Mississippi River in Trempealeau County in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 1,843 at the 2020 census. The village is surrounded by the Town of Trempealeau.

==History==
An ancient Native American site with earthwork mounds, also known as Trempealeau, has been studied near the village through archeological excavations in the 21st century. It is theorized as a possible mission site or colony of Cahokia, the major center of Mississippian culture from 1000CE to 1450CE located 500 miles to the south in present-day Illinois near St. Louis, Missouri.

Studies have been done through the Mississippi Valley Archaeology Center associated with the University of Wisconsin Madison. Archeologists Danielle Benden and Robert “Ernie” Boszhardt said they have found some evidence of Mississippian settlement about 1050E. The newcomers are believed to have introduced corn culture to the area. The archeology site is slightly downriver of the prominent landmark, Trempealeau Mountain. In 2013 evidence was found of several former structures that exhibited characteristics of Mississippian style. There is some evidence that a religious group came here from Cahokia, perhaps fleeing persecution.

European-American settlement did not take place here until the mid-19th century, although French and English fur traders interacted with Native Americans of the area from the colonial period and into the 19th century. A post office called Trempealeau was first established in 1852. The village was named by a French explorer after a nearby island in the Mississippi River.

==Geography==
Trempealeau is located at (44.006906, -91.434572).

<text>Viroqua is the county seat of Vernon County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 4,504 at the 2020 census. The city is in the town of Viroqua.

==Etymology==
The town was originally named “Farwell” after Leonard J. Farwell, second Governor of Wisconsin, but it was renamed “Viroqua” in 1854. It is unclear why the name was changed, and the source of the name is uncertain. One legend states that Viroqua was the name of the daughter of Black Hawk, but this is not supported by evidence. Another story attributes the name to a Mohawk Indian actress who performed in a theater on the East Coast or in Brantford, Canada. However, the town most likely took its name from the fictional lead character of the 1848 novel &quot;Viroqua, or, the Flower of the Ottawas&quot; by Emma Carra.

==History==
The Native American Ho-Chunk people inhabited the area now known as Vernon County and the area of Viroqua. The Ho-Chunk, formerly known as the Winnebago, are a Siouan-speaking people who lived in the western Great Lakes region for thousands of years. The Ho-Chunk were removed westward beginning in the 1820s.

There was a sharp rivalry between Viroqua and Springville to be named the county seat of Vernon County. A deed for of land was promised by pioneer Moses Decker, on condition that Viroqua be chosen as the county seat. The land constituted what became known as the County Addition to the city of Viroqua.

Decker was one of the early settlers in the area. He arrived in 1847 and laid out the village of Viroqua. He died in 1860. Earlier settlers arrived in 1844 and built lumber mills on the Kickapoo River. Farmers began arriving in 1846, some of whom were John Graham, T.J. Defreese and William C. McMichael.

In early 1851, the act authorizing the organization of Bad Axe, now Vernon County, was approved by Governor Nelson Dewey. Viroqua was awarded the county seat, pending a permanent location to be determined by a vote. In May 1852, residents voted in favor of Viroqua. The present Vernon County Courthouse was built in Viroqua in 1880.

On June 28, 1865, Viroqua was hit by a deadly tornado that left 22 dead.

==Transportation==
Viroqua is at the intersection of U.S. Highway 14, U.S. Highway 61, Wisconsin Highway 27, Wisconsin Highway 56, and Wisconsin Highway 82.

Recently, the highways and major streets in Viroqua were redone. Highways 14, 61, and 27 had lanes added to them to become four lanes, except for the four block section of downtown. That was kept two lanes to allow for parallel parking on the side of the road.

Viroqua was on the new airways route between La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Rockford, Illinois, when it was established in June 1932. The beacon light had about 15 large revolving beacons of 2,000,000 candle power when it was installed on the Mahlon Lepley farm, four miles (6 km) northeast of Viroqua.

Viroqua was formerly served by a Milwaukee Road branch line from Sparta via Leon, Melvina, Cashton and Westby.

===Bus service===
Commuter bus service towards La Crosse is provided seven times daily per direction by Scenic Mississippi Regional Transit.

=== Airport ===

Viroqua is serviced by the Viroqua Municipal Airport (Y51).

==Economy==
Viroqua is an accredited Main Street America city. Its downtown is listed on the Wisconsin and National Register of Historic Places.

Viroqua was dubbed &quot;The Town That Beat Walmart&quot; by &quot;Smithsonian Magazine&quot; in 1992 because it fostered businesses that co-exist with the retail giant. The city and its nonprofit chamber of commerce, the Viroqua Chamber Main Street, actively promote small business development through several state and federal programs. One noteworthy program that has kept downtown storefronts occupied has been the Pop-Up Shop Initiative, which allow entrepreneurs to use a space downtown rent-free for the holiday season.

Viroqua is a site of food tourism, as surrounding Vernon County is home to one of the highest densities of organic farms in the country, with over 200 in the area.

<text>Delavan is a city in Walworth County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 8,505 at the 2020 census. It is located southwest of Milwaukee. The city is located partially within the Town of Delavan, but the two entities are politically independent. Delavan is home to Delavan Lake which brings in a large number of tourists each year, and is also close to Lake Geneva, another popular tourist destination.

==History==

===Origins===
Delavan sits in the middle of what was once an inland sea. During the last ice age, the final glaciation, named the Michigan tongue, covered this region. The Michigan tongue descended along the area of Lake Michigan. The &quot;Delavan lobe&quot; of this glacier broke off, pushing southwest into the area of Walworth County.

The first humans known to inhabit the Delavan area were Native Americans around 1000 BCE. Later, between 500 and 1000 CE, Mound Builders lived in what is now the Delavan Lake area. Mound Builders were of the Woodland culture. The effigy mounds they erected along the shores of Delavan Lake numbered well over 200, according to an archeological survey done in the late 19th century by Beloit College. Many were along the north shore of the lake where Lake Lawn Resort now stands. The Potawotomi Indians settled around the lake in the late 18th century, although there were only an estimated 240 in the county. Some of their burial mounds are preserved in what is now Assembly Park.

From the mid-17th century through the mid-18th century, Delavan was part of &quot;New France&quot;. It came under British rule in the Province of Quebec following the French and Indian War. In accordance with the Treaty of Paris (1783), it was turned over to the United States and became part of the newly established Northwest Territory.

===American era===
Between 1800 and 1836, the Delavan area was part of the Indiana Territory, followed by the Illinois Territory, finally becoming part of the Wisconsin Territory in 1836. Statehood was granted to Wisconsin in 1848.

Between 1847 and 1894, Delavan was home to 26 circus companies. The Mabie Brothers U.S. Olympic Circus, then the largest in America, arrived in 1847, to become the first circus to quarter in the territory of Wisconsin. Its famous rogue elephant, &quot;Romeo&quot;, stood high, and . The original P. T. Barnum Circus was organized here in 1871 by William C. Coup and Dan Costello. Over 130 members of Delavan&#x27;s 19th century circus colony are buried in Spring Grove and St. Andrew cemeteries.

On July 21, 1948, Delavan was the site of Wisconsin&#x27;s Circus Centennial as part of the state&#x27;s celebration of 100 years of statehood. On May 2, 1966, Delavan was selected by the U.S. Post Office to issue on a first day cover basis, the five-cent American Circus commemorative postage stamp.

<text>Birchwood is a village in Washburn County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 402 at the 2020 census. The village is located within the Town of Birchwood.

==History==

===Knapp, Stout &amp; Company===
Knapp, Stout and Company was a logging company in Northern Wisconsin. Founded in 1846 William Willson brought the company together. The company was originally owned by; William Wilson, Andrew Tainter, John Knapp, and Henry Stout. Knapp, Stout and Co. became the largest lumber company in the world. In 1873 they owned 115,000 acres of pine forests. They put out 55,000,000 ft. of lumber, 20,000,000 shingles, and 20,000,000 lath annually. The company owned six big farms with six, or seven thousand acres of improved land to supply the lumber camps with pork and wheat.

===First Settlers===
Knapp, Stout, and Co. had a major impact on Northern Wisconsin. The large lumber company brought the SS and Omaha railroads to northern Wisconsin. They also created many logging camps that turned into small towns. Birchwood is located where it is due to the Birch Lake lumber camp, and the crossing of the Soo and the Omaha railroads.

Birchwood WI was platted in 1901. Birchwood was originally named Loomis after Wilbur Loomis, one of the first residents, and the first storekeeper. In 1912 the name was officially changed to Birchwood due to a political argument, and the abundance of birch trees in the area.

===The Birch Lake Dam===
The Birchwood dam was first owned by Knapp, Stout and Co. The first dam was built in 1881 from logs. The dam was enlarged by Knapp, Stout, and Co. in 1893 when they found that the first dam was too small. In 1911 the dam was sold to Chippewa Light &amp; Power Co., who built the first concrete dam. The dam was sold again in 1915 to the Wisconsin-Minnesota Light and Power Co. In 1916 the Wisconsin-Minnesota Light and Power Co. Brought electricity service to Birchwood.

===Birchwood&#x27;s Best===
In 1903 the Ahnapee Veneer and Seating Co. built a mill where Birchwood&#x27;s Best now stands. After the mill burned down in 1906, it was rebuilt. In 1921 the name was changed to the Algoma Panel Co. and in 1931 to the Algoma Plywood and Veneer Co. In 1931 the mill was sold to the U.S. Plywood Corporation. In 1943 U.S. Plywood ceased operations. Eleven months later a new corporation was formed and named the Birchwood Lumber and Veneer Co. The companies that owned the mill did their own logging until 1932, when they started hiring subcontractors to do the logging. Throughout the 20th century the mill has been Birchwood&#x27;s principal industry. In 2011 Birchwood&#x27;s Best was acquired by the Masonite International, which continues its operations today.

===Schools===
In 1902 the residents of Birchwood, set aside land for a school. Birchwood&#x27;s first school was a one-room building. A new graded school was built in 1903. In 1909 the school became overpopulated and classes were split up between the Methodist and Lutheran Churches until an addition was built. In 1921 a high school was built. This is the same building that is now used, with a few additions.

<text>Spooner is a city in Washburn County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 2,573 at the 2020 census. The city is located mostly within the southwest corner of the Town of Spooner, with a small portion extending into the Town of Beaver Brook on the south, the Town of Bashaw on the southwest, and the Town of Evergreen on the west. The city&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Crossroads of the North&quot;, is a reference to the city&#x27;s location at the junction of two U.S. highways, 53 and 63, and State Highways 70 and 253.

==History==
Originally a town in 1889, and officially incorporated as a city in 1909, Spooner&#x27;s history is closely interlaced with that of railroad history. In 1879, the North Wisconsin Railway was constructed north of the present-day city of Spooner. Following that, the operations of that railroad were moved south where it joined the Chicago and North Western at what was then called Chicago Junction.

The community, then initially only a station, was named by the general superintendent for the Chicago and North Western, Edwin W. Winter, for John Coit Spooner (1843–1919), who was a distinguished railroad attorney from what is now the city of Hudson in St. Croix County, northwestern Wisconsin. Spooner would later serve in the Wisconsin State Assembly and represent Wisconsin in the United States Senate (1885–1891, 1897–1907). He was a well-favored politician of his time and served as advisor to U.S. presidents Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, and Theodore Roosevelt.

Eventually, the lines were absorbed by the Chicago &amp; North Western Railroad. Passenger service ended in the early 1960s under the CNW ownership. In 1992, the Wisconsin Great Northern Railroad was incorporated, to serve as a freight hauler from Spooner to Trego, a nearby town, with a connection to the CNW. Although the freight idea did not work out, they began operating successful passenger excursion trains in 1997 (following the example of the nearby Duluth &amp; Northern Minnesota Railroad, which began passenger excursions in Duluth only a few years before), and were an instant success. The passenger trains were very successful, and after the 1995 takeover of the CNW by the Union Pacific, in 1998 UP announced intentions to abandon the line from Hayward Junction where it connected to the Wisconsin Central to the north through Spooner all the way down to Chippewa Falls. The company bought the portion of the line between Spooner and Hayward Junction in 1999, which greatly expanded passenger operations.

To this day they run popular robbery, western style, cowboy, and buffet style as well as more formal dinner trains. More recently, the Great Pumpkin train nearly sold out and now runs annually around the time of Halloween. The old CNW Spooner Railroad Depot now serves as the town&#x27;s Railroad Memories Museum.

The city was also once the hub of the Omaha Railroad Line. Its economy was once centered on the railroad and the two main lines that joined there.

<text>Germantown is a town in Washington County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 278 at the 2000 census. It is surrounded by the village of Germantown.

== History ==

The land that became Germantown was originally inhabited by Native Americans, including the Potawatomi tribe. The Potawatomi surrendered the land that became Germantown the United States Federal Government in 1833 through the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which (after being ratified in 1835) required them to leave Wisconsin by 1838. While many Native people moved west of the Mississippi River to Kansas, some chose to remain, and were referred to as &quot;strolling Potawatomi&quot; in contemporary documents because many of them were migrants who subsisted by squatting on their ancestral lands, which were now owned by white settlers. Eventually the Native Americans who evaded forced removal gathered in northern Wisconsin, where they formed the Forest County Potawatomi Community.

The community was originally designated as the Wisconsin Territory&#x27;s &quot;Town Nine,&quot; making it the oldest settlement in Washington County. Beginning in the 1840s, many German immigrants—particularly from the region of Hesse—settled in the area, which led to it being named &quot;Germantown.&quot;

The territorial legislature created the Town of Germantown on January 21, 1846, and the first town meeting was on April 7 of the same year. The town included the then-unincorporated communities of Dheinsville, Goldenthal, Kuhberg (later known as Victory Center), Meeker Hill, Rockfield, South Germantown, and Willow Creek.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Germantown&#x27;s economy relied heavily on agriculture, including dairy farming. The southern part of Germantown is rich in Silurian limestone, which was quarried beginning in the 1870s, particularly in the Rockfield and South Germantown areas. South Germantown was a stop on the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul starting in the late 19th century, and the hamlet grew and prospered because of its rail connects to other communities.

In 1927, South Germantown incorporated as the Village of Germantown out of some of the town&#x27;s land but was significantly smaller than it is in the 21st century.

From July 1944 until January 1946, the hamlet of Rockfield—then in the Town of Germantown—was the site of Camp Rockfield, an Allied prisoner of war camp that held 500 German prisoners of war, including captured members of the Afrika Korps and many soldiers captured at the Battle of Cherbourg. The prisoners had originally been held at Fort Sheridan, north of Chicago, but were transferred camps in rural Wisconsin, such as the one at Rockfield, to work in agriculture. The prisoners lived in a barracks that had originally been built as a warehouse for the local Rockfield Canning Company, where many prisoners worked as pea packers. Other POWs were transported to work sites throughout Ozaukee and Washington counties, including the Pick Manufacturing Company in West Bend and the Fromm Bros., Nieman &amp; Co. Fox Ranch in northern Mequon.

In 1963, Milwaukee annexed a small parcel in the southeastern part of the Town of Germantown to expand a landfill. Residents feared that Milwaukee would soon annex more of the town. As a defensive measure, the Village of Germantown annexed all of the surrounding unincorporated hamlets, which encompassed most of the town&#x27;s territory. At the time of the 1963 annexation, the Village of Germantown grew to an area of approximately 24 square miles. The village annexed more land in 1965 and 1976, reducing the town four non-contiguous parcels with a total area of 1.7 square miles.

<text>Germantown is a village in Washington County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 20,917 at the 2020 census. The village surrounds the Town of Germantown, and is part of the Milwaukee metropolitan area.

==History==
The land that became Germantown was originally inhabited by members of the Potawatomi tribe. The Potawatomi surrendered the land that became Germantown to the United States Federal Government in 1833 through the &quot;1833 Treaty of Chicago&quot;, which (after being ratified in 1835) required them to leave Wisconsin by 1838. While many Native people moved west of the Mississippi River to Kansas, some chose to remain or return after temporarily settling in the west, and were referred to as &quot;strolling Potawatomi&quot; in contemporary documents because many of them were migrants who subsisted by squatting on their ancestral lands, which were now owned by White settlers. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Potawatomi who evaded forced removal gathered in northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan where many worked in the timber industry and formed the Forest County Potawatomi Community.

The community was originally designated as the Wisconsin Territory&#x27;s &quot;Town Nine,&quot; making it the oldest settlement in Washington County. Beginning in the 1840s, many German immigrants—particularly from the regions of Bavaria, Hessen, Rheinland, Pommern, and Prussia—settled in the area, which led to it being named &quot;Germantown&quot;.

The territorial legislature created the Town of Germantown on January 21, 1846, and the first town meeting was on April 7 of the same year.

<text>Jackson is a town in Washington County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 3,516 at the 2000 census. The Village of Jackson is located partially within the town. The unincorporated community of Kirchhayn is also located in the town.

==Geography==
The 2,312-acre Jackson Marsh Wildlife Area, which is maintained by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, is located in the town and contains undeveloped forested wetlands. Cedar Creek, a tributary of the Milwaukee River runs also through the town.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 34.4 square miles (89.0 km2), of which, 34.2 square miles (88.7 km2) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.3 km2) of it (0.32%) is water.

==History==
The first white settlers arrived in the Jackson area in 1843. The Wisconsin territorial legislature created the Town of Jackson on January 21, 1846, naming the settlement for former-president Andrew Jackson, who had died several months earlier.

Early settlements in the town included the hamlet of Kirchhayn, which formed around David&#x27;s Star Lutheran Church in the 1840s, as well as the hamlet of Riceville, which later become the Village of Jackson. In the 1800s, the town&#x27;s economy relied heavily on agricultural, and including dairy farming. Some of the earliest businesses in the community were cheese factories and creameries.

In 1872, the Chicago and North Western Railway built a line from Milwaukee to Fond du Lac with a station in Riceville. Entrepreneurs took advantage of the transportation link, and built businesses and industries on the formerly agricultural land around the railway station. Riceville incorporated from the town&#x27;s land as the Village of Jackson on March 14, 1912.

The village experienced a population boom in the early 1970s and has continued to grow into the early 2000s. Between 1970 and 1975, the population more than tripled from 561 to 1,895. To accommodate the new population, the village annexed more land from the town for new residential subdivisions and commercial developments. The annexations created tax losses for the town. In 1999, the town and the village created an agreement setting the village&#x27;s maximum potential boundaries and outlining how the town would be compensated for future annexations. Jackson was the first community in Wisconsin to create such an agreement.

On July 17, 2012, a petroleum product pipeline spilled an estimated 54,600 gallons of gasoline in the Town of Jackson. Thirty-seven private wells contaminated by the spill were ordered abandoned by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. The West Shore Pipe Line Company, which owned the pipeline, paid the costs to extend water services from the Village of Jackson to a large part of the Town of Jackson.

In 1872, the Chicago and North Western Railway built a line from Milwaukee to Fond du Lac with a station in Riceville. Reis capitalized on the new source of transportation by building a general store, a grain elevator, and a saloon. Other entrepreneurs followed suit, and a village began to take shape around the railway station.

Riceville incorporated as the Village of Jackson on March 14, 1912.

The village population remained between 300 and 500 people in the early to mid-20th century, before experiencing a population boom in the early 1970s. Between 1970 and 1975, the population more than tripled from 561 to 1,895.

<text>Kewaskum is a town in Washington County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,119 at the 2000 census. The incorporated community of Village of Kewaskum is surrounded geographically by the Town of Kewaskum. The unincorporated community of Saint Michaels is located partially in the town.

==Toponymy==
Kewaskum was the leader of a group of Potawatomi Native Americans who lived in Washington County in the 1840s. He was friendly with the early settlers, including future Wisconsin state senator Densmore Maxon. He died sometime between 1847 and 1850. In 1849, the early settlers named the Town of Kewaskum (and later the village) in his honor. In the Potawatomi language, Kewaskum means &quot;turning back on his tracks&quot; or &quot;retracing his steps.&quot;

==History==

In the early 19th century, the Kewaskum area was home to Potawatomi Native Americans, who surrendered the land the United States Federal Government in 1833 through the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which (after being ratified in 1835) required them to leave Wisconsin by 1838. While many Potawatomis moved west of the Mississippi River to Kansas, some chose to remain, and were referred to as &quot;strolling Potawatomi&quot; in contemporary documents because many of them were migrants who subsisted by squatting on their ancestral lands, which were now owned by white settlers. One band of Potawatomis travelled through Dodge, Jefferson, and Washington counties, and was led by Chief Kewaskum, who had a camp on Pike Lake. The chief was friendly with the white settlers who began arriving in the 1840s. He died sometime between 1847 and 1850, but itinerant Native people lived in Washington County into the late 19th century, when many of them gathered in northern Wisconsin to form the Forest County Potawatomi Community.

The first settlers in the area were the Barnes family, who arrived in 1844. In 1847, the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature created the Town of North Bend from land that had previously been part of the Town of West Bend, and the community&#x27;s first post office was established. In 1849, the residents changed their community&#x27;s name to the Town of Kewaskum to distinguish it from neighboring West Bend.

While the first settlers were primarily farmers, the businesses soon followed to serve to early settlers. In 1852, J. H. Myer settled on a horseshoe bend in the Milwaukee River and built a sawmill and a gristmill. The settlement, which was originally known as &quot;Myer&#x27;s Mill&quot; before it became the Village of Kewaskum, soon became a market town with a general store and a blacksmith shop serving the local farmers. The first religious services were held in private homes, and in 1862 the Catholic settlers constructed a church. A German Methodist church was built in 1866 and a Lutheran church was built in 1868. In 1873, the Chicago and North Western Railway completed a line from Milwaukee to Fond du Lac with a station in the future Village of Kewaskum. The community&#x27;s rail connections caused the local economy to grow and prosper as new businesses, including hotels, stores, and grain elevators opened around the station. The Village of Kewaskum incorporated in 1895.

The village&#x27;s population boomed during the post–World War II economic expansion, doubling between 1950 and 1990, leading the village to annex land from the Town of Kewaskum for new commercial and residential developments. The village first annexed land in 1959, and again in many subsequent years, most recently in 2005.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 22.8 square miles (59.0 km2), of which, 22.8 square miles (59.0 km2) of it is land and 0.04 square miles (0.1 km2) of it (0.09%) is water.

The Village of Kewaskum incorporated in 1895.

While the village economy was primarily agricultural in the 19th and early 20th centuries, Kewaskum became increasingly industrialized throughout the 1900s. In 1919, Adolph L. Rosenheimer founded the Kewaskum Aluminum Company in the village to manufacture aluminum cookware. During World War II, the company made aluminum products for military use, before being acquired by Enterprise Aluminum Company of Ohio in 1945. The company was renamed Regal Ware in 1951, and through acquisitions of aluminum companies in Wisconsin, Illinois, Ohio, and Mississippi, moved into the international high-end consumer cookware market.
The community&#x27;s population grew during the post–World War II economic expansion, leading the village to annex land from the Town of Kewaskum for new commercial and residential developments. The village first annexed land in 1959 and again in twenty of the next forty-six years. Additionally, Kewaskum annexed a noncontiguous parcel of land in the Town of Auburn in Fond du Lac County in 1963.

==Government==
The village of Kewaskum&#x27;s local government consists of an elected Board President and six Board Trustees, as well as a hired village administrator. The Board President and Trustee term is 2 years.

<text>West Bend is a town in Washington County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 4,834 at the 2000 census. The City of West Bend is located partially within the town. The unincorporated community of Nabob is located in the town.

==History==

Northeastern Washington County&#x27;s earliest known inhabitants were pre-Columbian Mound Builders, who constructed effigy mounds in the area sometime between 650 CE and 1300 CE. They were semi-nomadic and survived by hunting, fishing, and gathering wild plants. They made pottery and constructed tools from bone, wood, stone, and occasionally copper. They built effigy mounds shaped like mammals, reptiles, birds and other creatures, both real and mythical, as well as conical, oval, and linear mounds, some of which contain human burials. Some mounds in the West Bend area were destroyed by white settlers to create farm fields, but several dozen survive and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Washington County &quot;Island&quot; Effigy Mound District, which includes the Lizard Mound County Park site in nearby Farmington as well as several privately owned sites.

In the early 19th century when the first white settlers arrived in Southeastern Wisconsin, the Potawatomi and Menominee Indians inhabited the land now occupied by the Town of West Bend. In 1831, the Menominee surrendered their claims to the land to the United States Federal Government through the Treaty of Washington. The Potawatomi surrendered their land claims in 1833 through the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which (after being ratified in 1835) required them to leave the area by 1838. While many Native people moved west of the Mississippi River to Kansas, some chose to remain, and were referred to as &quot;strolling Potawatomi&quot; in contemporary documents because many of them were migrants who subsisted by squatting on their ancestral lands, which were now owned by white settlers. In the mid-1800s, there was a large Native American village on the shore of Silver Lake in the Town of West Bend. Eventually the Potawatomi who evaded forced removal gathered in northern Wisconsin, where they formed the Forest County Potawatomi Community.

In 1845, the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature authorized the construction of a road to connect Fond du Lac and Milwaukee with a new settlement near the halfway point to provide provisions and overnight accommodations for travelers. Byron Kilbourn, James Kneeland, and Erastus B. Wolcott were the commissioners tasked with constructing the new settlement, and they decided to locate it on a westward bend in the Milwaukee River—the present-day location of the City of West Bend—because of the river&#x27;s potential as a power source for mills. By the end of 1845, they had purchased eight eighty-acre tracts of land along the river, and invited local landowner E. N. Higgins to join their venture as well. In 1846, Wolcott constructed a dam and a sawmill in the new community, and in 1848, he constructed a gristmill.

The Wisconsin Territorial legislature created the Town of West Bend on January 20, 1846. At the time, the town included land that is now part of the City of West Bend, as well as the neighboring towns of Barton, Farmington, Kewaskum, and Trenton.

In the 1840s and early 1850s, Washington County included the land along Lake Michigan that is now Ozaukee County, Wisconsin. Port Washington served as the county seat, which was controversial at the time. West Bend, Cedarburg, and Grafton vied for position of Washington County seat and the material advantages it would entail. In 1850, the Wisconsin legislature voted to bisected Washington County into northern and southern counties, with Port Washington and Cedarburg as the county seats, respectively. County residents failed to ratify the bill, because there were voting irregularities in some communities. In 1853 the legislature instead bisected the county into eastern and western sections, creating Ozaukee County. Port Washington became the seat of the new county, and the Washington County seat moved to the town of West Bend. The bisection was controversial. When Washington County officials from West Bend arrived in Port Washington to collect relevant county records, they were run out of town, and Ozaukee County officials refused to hand over the records for several months.

A railroad station was constructed in West Bend in 1873, bringing new residents, businesses and economic connections into the community. The future City of West Bend&#x27;s location on the river, its status as the seat of county government, and its rail connections caused the city to grow and expand in the 1870s and 1880s. In March 1885, the City of West Bend incorporated from some of the town&#x27;s land.

The City of West Bend experienced dramatic population growth during the post–World War II economic expansion. As automobiles became more commonplace, more people moved to the city and commuted for work, taking advantage of new roads such as U.S. Route 45, which connected the West Bend area to Milwaukee. Between 1950 and 1990 the population more than tripled from 6,849 to 23,916, and the city annexed land from the Town of West Bend, as well as the neighboring towns of Barton and Trenton.

<text>West Bend is a city in and the county seat of Washington County, Wisconsin, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 31,752. It is part of the Milwaukee metropolitan area.

==History==

===Early history and settlement===

Northeastern Washington County&#x27;s earliest known inhabitants were pre-Columbian Mound Builders, who constructed effigy mounds in the area sometime between 650 CE and 1300 CE. They were semi-nomadic and survived by hunting, fishing, and gathering wild plants. They made pottery and constructed tools from bone, wood, stone, and occasionally copper. They built effigy mounds shaped like mammals, reptiles, birds and other creatures, both real and mythical, as well as conical, oval, and linear mounds, some of which contain human burials. Some mounds in the West Bend area were destroyed by settlers to create farm fields, but several dozen survive and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Washington County &quot;Island&quot; Effigy Mound District, which includes the Lizard Mound County Park site in nearby Farmington as well as several privately owned sites.

In the early 19th century when the first White settlers arrived in Southeastern Wisconsin, the Potawatomi and Menominee Indians inhabited the land now occupied by the City of West Bend. In 1831, the Menominee surrendered their claims to the land to the United States Federal Government through the Treaty of Washington. The Potawatomi surrendered their land claims in 1833 through the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which (after being ratified in 1835) required them to leave the area by 1838. While many Native people moved west of the Mississippi River to Kansas, some chose to remain, and were referred to as &quot;strolling Potawatomi&quot; in contemporary documents because many of them were migrants who subsisted by squatting on their ancestral lands, which were now owned by settlers. In the mid-1800s, there was a large Native American village on the shore of Silver Lake, southwest of the modern-day City of West Bend. Eventually the Potawatomi who evaded forced removal gathered in northern Wisconsin, where they formed the Forest County Potawatomi Community.

The present-day city traces its origins to two communities that formed when the first White settlers arrived in the mid-1840s. One community was West Bend, and the other was the now-defunct Village of Barton. In 1845, the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature authorized the construction of a road to connect Fond du Lac and Milwaukee with a new settlement near the halfway point to provide provisions and overnight accommodations for travelers. Byron Kilbourn, James Kneeland, and Erastus B. Wolcott were the commissioners tasked with constructing the new settlement, and they decided to locate it on a westward bend in the Milwaukee River—the present-day location of the City of West Bend—because of the river&#x27;s potential as a power source for mills. By the end of 1845, they had purchased eight eighty-acre tracts of land along the river, and invited local landowner E. N. Higgins to join their venture as well. In 1846, Wolcott constructed a dam and a sawmill in the new community, and in 1848, he constructed a gristmill.

In 1845, land surveyor and early settler Barton Salisbury built a sawmill on the river north of West Bend. The community that grew around the mill was known as Salisbury&#x27;s Mills before to the name was changed to Barton in 1853. Additional sawmills and gristmills sprang up on the river in the community&#x27;s early years, and by 1855, Barton&#x27;s population was over 1,000, making it larger than neighboring West Bend. Despite its early growth, however, Barton would be overshadowed by West Bend in the coming decades.

===19th century politics and growth===
The Wisconsin Territorial legislature created the Town of West Bend on January 20, 1846. At the time, the town included land that is now part of the City of West Bend, as well as the neighboring towns of Barton, Farmington, Kewaskum, and Trenton.

In the 1840s and early 1850s, Washington County included the land along Lake Michigan that is now Ozaukee County, Wisconsin. Port Washington served as the county seat, which was controversial at the time. West Bend, Cedarburg, and Grafton vied for position of Washington County seat and the material advantages it would entail. In 1850, the Wisconsin legislature voted to bisected Washington County into northern and southern counties, with Port Washington and Cedarburg as the county seats, respectively. County residents failed to ratify the bill, because there were voting irregularities in some communities. In 1853 the legislature instead bisected the county into eastern and western sections, creating Ozaukee County. Port Washington became the seat of the new county, and the Washington County seat moved to West Bend. The bisection was controversial. When Washington County officials from West Bend arrived in Port Washington to collect relevant county records, they were run out of town, and Ozaukee County officials refused to hand over the records for several months.

On November 25, 1853, the County Board of Supervisors attempted to change the name of West Bend to Lamartine City. However, this change was not well-received and the name was changed back 18 hours later.

In November 1862 during the American Civil War, the draft was unpopular with some Washington County residents, including German immigrants who had experienced or fled conscription in their homelands. On the day that men from the nearby Town of Trenton were being drafted at the courthouse in West Bend, a mob disrupted the proceedings and forced the draft commissioner to flee to Milwaukee. On November 22, 1862, the commissioner returned to West Bend with six companies of the 30th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment to prevent further disruptions.

West Bend was incorporated as a village in 1868. railroad station was constructed in West Bend in 1873, bringing new residents, businesses and economic connections into the community. The community had previously only been located on the western bank of the Milwaukee River, but in the 1870s residents began to develop property on the river&#x27;s eastern bank as well. In March 1885, West Bend incorporated as a city.

===Industrialization and post-war growth===
In the 1890s, West Bend&#x27;s economy began to transition from a rural market town to an industrial community. Early manufacturers included the Schmidt and Stork Wagon Company; the Enger-Kress Pocketbook Company, which moved its operations to West Bend in 1884; the West Bend Aluminum Company, which began manufacturing low-cost aluminum utensils in 1911; and Amity Leather, which was founded in West Bend in 1915 and was once the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of leather billfolds. Other 20th century manufacturers in West Bend included Pick Manufacturing Company, which fabricated automotive parts; Gehl Brothers Manufacturing Company, which produced construction and agricultural equipment; and West Bend Concrete Products.

Barton also benefited from West Bend&#x27;s growth in the early 20th century, and the community incorporated as the Village of Barton in 1925. However, the village existed for fewer than four decades before being annexed by the City of West Bend on November 1, 1961.

During World War II, West Bend experienced labor shortages because many local men had been conscripted into the military. In 1944 and 1945, Pick Manufacturing Company and the West Bend Canning Company addressed labor shortages by contracting German prisoners of war from local POW camps in Little Kohler and Rockfield.

West Bend experienced dramatic population growth during the post–World War II economic expansion. As automobiles became more commonplace, more people moved to West Bend and commuted for work, taking advantage of new roads such as U.S. Route 45, which connected West Bend to Milwaukee. Between 1950 and 1990 the population more than tripled from 6,849 to 23,916, and the city annexed land from the surrounding towns as well as the Village of Barton.

The West Bend tornado on April 4, 1981, struck the city, killing 3 people directly and 3 indirectly (totaling 6 deaths), and injuring either 53 or more than 100 (estimates from different sources differ). There is a monument at a park near Green Tree Elementary School.

====Library controversy====
In 2009, a controversy arose after a local couple complained to the West Bend Community Memorial Library about the presence of &quot;sexually explicit books&quot; and &quot;books for youth on homosexuality&quot; in the young adult section of the library. A petition called on the library to label the identified books as explicit, move them to the adult section of the library, install Internet content filters on the library&#x27;s computers, and &quot;adopt a policy to attain balance in the viewpoints of selections (both affirming and opposing) that the libraries carry in issues sufficiently controversial within the West Bend community (i.e. homosexuality). Specifically, we request faith-based and/or ex-gay books affirming traditional heterosexual perspectives be added to the library.&quot;

The West Bend Common Council refused to reappoint four library trustees whose terms were ending. One councilman complained that the library board was stonewalling the complaint, while another asserted that the library trustees were not serving the interests of the community “with their ideology.” The council&#x27;s actions were widely criticized, and local citizens unsuccessfully sought to have the vote rescinded. After a public hearing on the petition in June 2009, the library board voted to reject any restrictions on young adults&#x27; access to books in the library.

Four Wisconsin men belonging to the Christian Civil Liberties Union filed a claim against the West Bend library, asking for $30,000 apiece for &quot;emotional distress&quot;, and that Francesca Lia Block&#x27;s book &quot;Baby Be-Bop&quot; be &quot;burned or destroyed.&quot;

===Mayoral Election Results===

===2019 Resignation Situation===
Former mayor Kraig Sadownikow announced his resignation as mayor on October 21, 2019, following a closed session. The reasoning for his resignation was because of an upcoming development where he had a current business relationship with the people involved for over 15 years, and Sadownikow was concerned he would have a bias regarding it. This situation had been addressed to Sadowinkow and a part of the community shared his concern with bias. Sadownikow said &quot;I’ve got to separate my business life from my service life and the best way to maintain my own integrity and the integrity of the office and the project is for me to resign&quot;. Sadownikow&#x27;s resignation was immediate. The City Council held a special meeting to decide what will happen. The council decided to have an interim mayor finish off the rest of Sadownikow&#x27;s mayoral term. District 6 Alderman Steve Hoogester was appointed as interim mayor on November 4, 2019. Hoogester returned to his role as District 6 Alderman after he completed Sadownikow&#x27;s term.

===2007 Resignation Situation===
Former Mayor Doug Bade resigned from his office in late May in order to pursue an out-of-state job. The common council was tasked with appointing an interim mayor to serve the last 10 months of Bade&#x27;s term. On June 5, the council decided to appoint their council president Kristine Deiss. This proved to be a controversial decision as the vote to appoint her was blocked when Aldermen Allen Carter, Terry Vrana, and Scott Frederick walked out. Eventually, on June 10 the vote was held successfully. Kristine Deiss was able to win reelection after she finished off Bade&#x27;s term.

<text>The Town of Brookfield is located in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 6,477 at the 2020 census. The unincorporated community of Goerke&#x27;s Corners is located in the town.

==History==
The town is west of Milwaukee in Waukesha County in an area originally inhabited by Potawatomi Indians.

In May 1838, Jacques Vieux Jr., with a large party of white settlers, led the local Potawatomi west. The Wisconsin territorial legislature organized the town in 1839, although town government was not formed until 1843. By 1839, the population needed a school house. The town was served by the Milwaukee and Mississippi Railroad (now the Canadian Pacific Rail), which also erected a depot in 1853, forming the Brookfield Junction. In the year 1850, the Town of Brookfield had 1,944 inhabitants and in land area covered 36 square miles. The town slowly grew over following years. This quiet, rural atmosphere attracted one notorious resident, Al Capone, as he established an area to live and a distillery on Brookfield Road.

Development in Town of Brookfield began to increase after the Second World War, and the town continued to grow thanks to building programs and postwar population dynamics. The City of Brookfield was incorporated from 17.5 square miles of the central and eastern parts of the town on August 14, 1954. The next year, the Village of Elm Grove was also organized out of a 3.25 square mile part of the town in the east.

After continued annexation by the City of Waukesha and the City of Brookfield, by 2005 the Town of Brookfield had decreased in size to 5.5 square miles. On March 26, 2012, the town of Brookfield filed a petition to incorporate to become a village, which ultimately failed in 2015. Previous attempts in 1999 and 2001 likewise failed.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 5.5 square miles (14.3 km), all of it land.

<text>Brookfield is a city in eastern Waukesha County, Wisconsin, United States. It had a population of 41,464 at the 2020 census. The city is adjacent to the Town of Brookfield and is part of the Milwaukee metropolitan area.

==History==
Brookfield is west of Milwaukee in Waukesha County in an area originally inhabited by Potawatomi Indians. The first white settler, William Howe, arrived in 1820 with a Presidential Land Grant giving him title to the area. Soon after, Robert Curren bought a claim in 1836 and established a tavern and inn.

In May 1838, Jacques View Jr., with a large party of white settlers, led the local Potawatomi west. Caroline Quiner, the mother of Laura Ingalls Wilder, was born in a cabin in 1839 in what is now the City of Brookfield, near the current intersection of Brookfield Road and Davidson Road. By 1839, the population needed a school house, as the 1840 census showed a population of 148. In these 1840s, George Gebhardt started trading with the surrounding Potawatomi and Menominee neighbors. 1843 is when the first church was built, by the Irish Catholic congregation, named St. Dominic. 1848 was when telegraph lines were laid through Brookfield, towards Waukesha. Communication was made easier due to this. In 1849, cholera reached Brookfield, and one Laura Grover recalls, &quot;The death-like stillness was appalling; nothing was seen but the death carts rolling round the streets gathering the recent dead... I believe there were fifty deaths from cholera that day.&quot; The same year, 64 Brookfield residents voted in favor of giving suffrage to black residents, and 0 the other way. In 1850, cholera again went through Brookfield, and according to one Earl Thayer, &quot;The cholera returned... more terrible than the year before. People literally died walking along the streets. Official reports put the toll at over 300.&quot;

In 1850, the Milwaukee and Mississippi Railroad (now the Canadian Pacific Rail) built a railroad through the town, which in 1853 erected a depot, forming the Brookfield Junction. In the year 1850, the Town of Brookfield had 1,944 inhabitants and in land area covered 36 square miles. The town slowly grew over following years, with the economy being mostly agricultural, with Brookfield Junction serving as a commercial center for the surrounding farms. The Civil War had little effect on this town, despite the severe losses of members serving from the state. &quot;More than 12,000 died: 3,802 were killed in action or died of wounds and 8,499 died from disease, exposure, and other causes.&quot; In 1867, a second rail depot was constructed, which still stands.

In the 1900s, Brookfield gained a new reputation. Waukesha County was called Cow County, U.S.A., as according to advertisers, they claimed that in the county there were more cows than people. This was, of course, fantastical, although there were cows. This did help cement Wisconsin&#x27;s dairy reputation. The Spanish flu, killed many people in the area, but not as many as cholera had in the past. On May 31, 1914, a tornado hit, devastating the farmers and the rural area.

Al Capone became a notorious resident, as he established an area to live and a distillery on Brookfield Road where Capone Court is today. In 1928, the first suburban development, Kinsey&#x27;s Garvendale, a residential subdivision, was created. Early subdivisions grew slowly due to the Great Depression hitting a year later, affecting its growth and killing demand.

Development in Brookfield began to increase after the Second World War. Suburban development was encouraged by a scarcity of urban area housing, the baby boom, and government sponsored building programs, which further grew the town, and after several annexations of neighboring communities, an incorporation drive started. The City of Brookfield was incorporated from the town of Brookfield, a portion of which still survives along the city&#x27;s western edge, on August 14, 1954. The first mayor was Franklin Wirth, and he oversaw the new city, which at the time had a population of 7,900 and covered an area of 17.5 square miles. Much of the land was still in agricultural use, so the city&#x27;s founders encouraged orderly development of office and industrial areas to cause the community to function with strong industrial and commercial base.

Today, Brookfield covers over 27 square miles, with a population of over 40,000 residents.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The &quot;sub-continental divide&quot; passes through Brookfield; on the eastern side of this divide, easily marked by the crest at Calhoun Road and Capitol Drive, water flows to Lake Michigan on its way to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence; on the western side of this divide, water flows to the Fox River of Illinois and Wisconsin on its way to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico.

There is a heron rookery on a site northwest of Capitol Drive and Brookfield Road.

<text>Oconomowoc ( ) is a city in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, United States. The name was derived from Coo-no-mo-wauk, the Potawatomi term for &quot;waterfall.&quot; The population was 18,203 at the 2020 census. The city is partially adjacent to the Town of Oconomowoc and near the village of Oconomowoc Lake, Wisconsin.

==History==
Before 1700, this region was inhabited by Potawatomi peoples descended from Woodland Indians known as &quot;mound builders&quot;. There are also reports that the Sauk Indian chief Black Hawk had a campsite on Oconomowoc Lake.

The first white person recorded in the area was Amable (sometimes spelled &quot;Aumable&quot;) Vicau, brother-in-law of Solomon Juneau, one of the founders of Milwaukee. Vicau established a trading post in 1827. White settlers soon followed, beginning in 1830.

In April 1837, New York native Charles Sheldon staked a 160-acre claim on the eastern shore of what is now Fowler Lake, registering it with the Land Bank of Milwaukee on April 21, 1837. A few days later, H.W. Blanchard acquired a claim adjacent to that of Sheldon on the other side of the lake, which he later sold off to Philo Brewer. Brewer constructed what some consider to be the first residence within Oconomowoc&#x27;s current legal limits, a site located at what is now 517 N. Lake Road, between La Belle and Fowler lakes. The first recorded birth was that of Eliza Jane Dewey on January 19, 1840, in the lodgings above a chair factory located at 116 N. Walnut. The first recorded death was that of Jerusha Foster, who died somewhere between the ages of 30 and 36 on March 19, 1841. Initially buried at Zion Church point, she was eventually re-interred at Nashotah Mission.

Oconomowoc was incorporated as a town in 1844, although residents had to go to Summit to get their mail until 1845. Travel and communication links between the new town and nearby cities were quickly established. The Watertown Plank Road was extended to connect Oconomowoc to the nearby towns of Milwaukee, Waukesha, Pewaukee, and Watertown in 1850. Such infrastructure encouraged further settlement, and by 1853 the town grew to a population of 250, with ten stores, three hotels, one gristmill, and one sawmill (both located near the present Lake Road bridge), and a schoolhouse. The first passenger train from Milwaukee arrived in Oconomowoc on December 14, 1854, as part of the Milwaukee and Watertown Railroad Company&#x27;s rapidly expanding Milwaukee &amp; Mississippi line.

Large houses were established around the Oconomowoc lakes, particularly Oconomowoc Lake and Lac La Belle. The population grew so much that Oconomowoc incorporated as a city in 1865, and by 1880 it had a population of 3,000. In August 1899 a professional golf tournament hosted by the Oconomowoc Country Club was won by Harry Turpie.

In 2003, Oconomowoc acquired Pabst Farms from the Town of Summit. Pabst Farms, which had previously been owned by the Pabst family, is being developed as a mixture of commercial and residential property. On April 2, 2008, a gas line exploded just west of downtown, destroying the First Baptist Church on West Wisconsin Avenue. The church, which was built in 1913, was completely destroyed, except for the frame of its bell tower, which later had to be torn down as it was at risk of collapse. The source of the explosion was an old gas line that had been capped off sometime in 1972–1973; it ruptured after having been struck by a backhoe as utility work was being done on Wisconsin Avenue in preparation for reconstruction of the street.

<text>Waukesha is a village in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 8,457 at the 2020 census. The City of Waukesha is located adjacent to the village.

== History ==
Originally part of the Town of Muskego, the Town of Prairie Village (soon renamed Prairieville) was named after the Native American settlement in that area. The town was renamed in 1847, soon after the new Waukesha County was created from the western portion of Milwaukee County. On January 10, 1852, the settled area once known as Prairieville was separated from the Town of Waukesha, and incorporated as the village (later the city) of Waukesha. The remainder of the town continued to bear the name as well (as is customary in Wisconsin).

On May 12, 2020, the former town of Waukesha incorporated as a village following a referendum where residents voted 9-to-1 in favor of incorporation. While the City of Waukesha sued, challenging the legality of the incorporation, the Village eventually won the fight after the Wisconsin Supreme Court let a lower court ruling stand that upheld the incorporation. 

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 23.0 square miles (59.5 km2), of which, 22.9 square miles (59.3 km2) of it is land, and 0.1 square miles (0.3 km2) of it (0.44%) is water.

The Potawatomi had been forced to cede all of their lands in Wisconsin in 1833 due to poverty and in spite of their support of the United States in the Black Hawk War.

Now that the United States owned the land, white American settlement could begin in &quot;Penāēwīkoh&quot;. The Town of Fremont was first settled in the spring of 1849 by D. Gordon.

<text>Waupaca ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Waupaca County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 6,282 at the 2020 census.

A portion extends west into the adjacent Town of Farmington, and there is also a noncontiguous area of the city in the Town of Lind to the south. The city is divided into natural areas, city areas, and industrial areas.

== History ==
Native American mound builders lived in the area prior to European settlement. At one time there were 72 earthwork mounds in the area, some of them ancient prehistoric works.

“Waupaca” is an Menominee word, Wāpahkoh, which means Place of Tomorrow Seen Clearly. For more than 10,000 years, the Menominee occupied about 10 million acres, including Waupaca and the Chain O’Lakes area. The Menominee in the Waupaca area moved between large villages on Taylor and Otter Lakes and camps along the falls on the Waupaca River.

In a series of seven treaties, the Menominee ceded their lands to the United States. The final treaty, in 1848, relinquished the last of the Menominee&#x27;s land, which included Waupaca.

The first white settlers, five men from Vermont, came to Waupaca looking for “the falls” in 1849. The settlers made camp near the end of what is now North Main Street with plans to harness the power of the falls and establish a community.

By 1852, a post office had been established and the settlement was officially named Waupaca. Waupaca was incorporated as a village on May 4, 1857, by an act of the Wisconsin State Legislature. This act was repealed on April 7, 1862, but revived on June 17 of the same year. Waupaca was incorporated as a city by the legislature on March 5, 1875.

Beginning in the 1960s and continuing to the present, the city has expanded its population and area through annexation.
