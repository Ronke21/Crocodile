<text>Leopold Zakharovich Trepper (23 February 1904 – 19 January 1982) was a Polish-Israeli Communist, career Soviet agent of the Red Army Intelligence and resistance fighter. With the code name Otto, Trepper had worked with the Red Army since 1930.

Trepper and Richard Sorge, a Soviet military intelligence officer, were the two main Soviet agents in Europe and were employed as &quot;roving agents&quot; to set up espionage networks throughout Europe and in Japan. While Sorge was a penetration agent, Trepper ran a series of clandestine cells for organising agents in Europe. Trepper used the latest technology at the time—small wireless radios—to communicate with Soviet intelligence. Although the Funkabwehr&#x27;s monitoring of the radios transmission eventually led to the destruction of Trepper&#x27;s organisation, this sophisticated use of the technology enabled the espionage organisation to behave as a network with the ability to achieve tactical surprise and deliver high-quality intelligence, such as the warning of Operation Barbarossa. In 1936, Trepper became the technical director of a Soviet Red Army Intelligence unit in western Europe. He was responsible for recruiting agents and creating espionage networks.

Trepper was an experienced intelligence officer, and an extremely resourceful and capable man completely at home in the west. He was a man who could not be drawn in conversation, who lived a reclusive life, and had a talent of judging people that enabled him to easily penetrate significant groups. By the start of World War II, Trepper controlled a large espionage network in Belgium, that had links with Dutch, German and Swiss agents and operated seven separate espionage networks in France. By 1942, his operation had been discovered and he was arrested on 24 November 1942 by the Sonderkommando Rote Kapelle, who gave it the name Red Orchestra (&quot;Rote Kapelle&quot;). Trepper agreed to work with the Germans. He eventually betrayed many of his collaborators who went to their death, in an effort to shield the French Communist Party (PCF) from investigation. He eventually betrayed them as well. On 13 September 1943, he managed to escape. At the end of the war, he returned to the Soviet Union and was imprisoned for 10 years. When he was released, he returned to Poland. In 1974, he migrated to Israel with his wife and three sons. 

==Life==
On 23 February 1904, Leopold Trepper was born to a large Jewish family of 10 children in Nowy Targ, Poland, which was part of Austria-Hungary at the time. Trepper&#x27;s father was a travelling farm machinery and seed merchant who later died when Trepper was almost twelve, leaving the family in financial straits. His parents sent him to school in Lwów, to escape the strongly militant and anti-Semitic tradition in Poland. Trepper met his future wife, Luba, in Lwów. She worked in a chocolate factory and took evening classes to train as a teacher. She was also a Jewish communist who travelled under the aliases Sarah Orschitzer and Luba Brekson. After school, Trepper moved to Kraków to study history and literature at the Jagiellonian University. His lack of money led him to left-wing student groups. After the October Revolution, he joined the Bolsheviks and became a communist.

After the Polish–Soviet War, Poland suffered an economic crisis and Trepper had to leave university due to a lack of funds. He found work first as a workshop locksmith, mason, and later worked in the mines in Katowice. After leaving the mines, he worked in Dąbrowa Górnicza where, due to extreme poverty and lack of food, he agitated the workers in Dombrova to strike. As one of the ringleaders, he was caught and imprisoned for eight months. His later pseudonym, Domb, came from Dombrowa, the German stylization of Dąbrowa Górnicza.

Trepper applied for a visa to France when he found it impossible to obtain work after the uprising, but was refused. Earlier, in 1916, Trepper had joined the Zionist, socialist movement Hashomer Hatzair. This membership was to help him in 1926 to emigrate to Haifa, Palestine, via Brindisi to work on the roads and later as an agricultural worker in a kibbutz. Orschitzer followed Trepper to Palestine. She was involved in an illegal communist demonstration, and was arrested and jailed; she would have been deported had she not married a Palestinian citizen. 

After moving to Tel Aviv in 1929, Trepper became a member of the central committee of the Palestine Communist Party. Between 1928 and 1930, Trepper was the organiser of the Eḥud or Unity faction, a Jewish-Arab communist labour organisation within the Histadrut trade union body; most of its members came from the Kerem HaTeimanim area and worked against the British forces in Palestine. In 1929, he attended a meeting of the International Red Aid, where he was identified as an agitator and militant communist by the British, who subsequently arrested and interned him for 15 days at the citadel&#x27;s prison in Acre, Israel. Trepper organised a hunger strike after learning that the communist prisoners were to be deported. He was released after news of the hunger strike reached London and the British newspapers, and he and the hunger strikers were placed on stretchers outside the prison, as they were too weak to walk due to lack of food.

In March 1930, after he was given the choice of leaving Palestine or being forcefully deported to Cyprus, Trepper travelled via Syria to Marseille, France, and worked as a dishwasher. He then travelled to Paris where he found work as a decorator living a poor existence. He came into contact with numerous left wing intellectuals and communist workers that eventually led him to become a member of the Rabkor, an illegal political organisation that was dominated by communists who sent both men and intelligence to Moscow. He continued to work for the organisation until French intelligence dismantled it in 1932. Trepper left Paris on a Polish passport and escaped to Berlin by train, where he contacted the Soviet embassy. After several days, he was ordered to report to Moscow in the spring of 1932.

Between 1932 and 1935, Trepper worked to become a GRU agent by learning his trade. After attending KUNMZ University, where he obtained a diploma, he studied history at the Institute of Red Professors and was awarded a degree, allowing him to work as a history teacher in Moscow. Trepper was in constant touch with the Russian intelligence instructors who taught him the practical skills of an espionage agent. At the same time, Orschitzer also attended KUNMZ University for a year.

In 1935, Trepper submitted a newspaper column covering art to the newspaper for Russian Jews called &quot;Truth&quot;. In the winter of the same year his training was completed.

==Espionage career==
In 1935 or 1936, Trepper was given the post of technical director of Soviet intelligence in Western Europe and was known as the Big Chief. He returned to Paris on a passport under the name Sommer, and spent five months investigating the extensive network and accidentally exposed a double agent: a Dutch Jew who was the former head of the Soviet espionage network in the United States and was turned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He returned to the Soviet Union under the name Majeris to inform Soviet intelligence of his findings and went back to Paris five months later.

In 1936, Trepper visited Scandinavia for a short-term technical mission, before returning to Paris — which remained his base until the end of 1938 — in December. For most of 1937, he was concerned with extensive planning and re-organisation of Soviet intelligence operations in Western Europe; in that year he visited Switzerland, the British Isles, and Scandinavia.

===Foreign Excellent Raincoat Company===
In the autumn of 1938, Trepper made contact with Jewish businessman Léon Grossvogel, whom he knew in Palestine. Grossvogel ran a small business called &quot;Le Roi du Caoutchouc&quot; or &quot;The Raincoat King&quot; on behalf of its owners. Trepper used provided money to create the export division of The Raincoat King called the Foreign Excellent Raincoat Company, which dealt in raincoat exports and was considered by Trepper to be the ideal cover for the group&#x27;s espionage network. As the business had to operate with the full knowledge of the state, shares had to be issued. Among the shareholders was former official of the Belgian Foreign Office, Jules Jaspar. Jaspar&#x27;s brother, Henri Jaspar, was the former prime minister of Belgium, so Jaspar was seen as the ideal person to direct the company and provide it with a veneer of respectability. The company was created in December 1938.

On 6 March 1939, Trepper used the alias Adam Mikler and identified as a wealthy Canadian businessman, traveled from Quebec while being accompanied by wife, who traveled as Anna Mikler. They moved to Brussels from Paris, making it their new base and settled in their apartment located at 198 Avenue Richard Neybergh, Brussels. After the company was created, Trepper used the circulation of gossip and rumours by his group to spread the word that a wealthy Canadian had funded the business to establish his cover in the Belgian business community. On 25 March 1939, Trepper met the GRU intelligence agent Mikhail Makarov in a café. Makarov, a wireless telegraphy (WT) operator, forger, and expert on secret inks, had been sent from Moscow via Stockholm and Copenhagen to Paris whilst travelling on a Uruguayan passport, under the alias Carlos Alamo.

Makarov&#x27;s original duty was to provide Trepper with forged documentation, but since Grossvogel had introduced Abraham Rajchmann, who became the group&#x27;s forger, he became a WT operator for the group instead and was posted to Ostend to work at a branch of the Raincoat Company, which was sold to him to strengthen his cover. Makarov immediately started to train other operators in WT procedure. In July 1939 Anatoly Gurevich, posing as the wealthy Vincente Sierra, arrived in Brussels on a Uruguayan passport, and contacted Trepper in Ghent on 17 July. It was arranged that Trepper would teach the operation of the Raincoat Company to Gurevich, who would then move to Denmark to establish a new firm. To make contacts across different social strata, Gurevich familiarised himself with Belgian society and studied the country to learn about its economy. Gurevich took part in ballroom dancing and riding lessons, and as he travelled between luxury hotels, mail bearing the stamps of Uruguay awaited his arrival.

In the months leading up to the war, Trepper&#x27;s plans changed, and Gurevich ended up working as an assistant to Trepper. Gurevich performed the normal bureaucratic operations in an espionage network including being a cipher clerk, deciphering instructions from Soviet intelligence, and preparing reports with information forwarded from a contact in the Soviet Trade Representation of Belgium. In 1939, Trepper met the American classical dancer, Georgie De Winter in Brussels. De Winter became Trepper&#x27;s mistress and had a child, Patrick De Winter; historians are unsure if the child was Trepper&#x27;s.

===World War II===
====France====
In July 1940, Trepper fled Belgium with Grossvogel and moved to Paris, where Grossvogel and Polish Jew Hillel Katz were Trepper&#x27;s main assistants. Trepper changed his alias to Jean Gilbert and got in touch with General Ivan Susloparov, who was the Soviet military attaché in the Vichy government. On their first meeting, Trepper informed Susloparov of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s plan to invade the Soviet Union, which the latter believed to be true. Trepper also arranged to have his wife and child returned to Moscow, and they left in August 1940. However, his main goal was to find and make use of a radio transmitter and a radio operator. Susloparov supplied the names of a couple who were Polish-Jewish militant communists — Hersch and Miriam Sokol — as possible radio operators—but both the Sokols had to be trained in radio procedures by Grossvogel. At the same time, Trepper recruited civil engineer and Russian aristocrat Basil Maximovitch.

====Simexco and Simex====
In March 1941, Simexco was established in Paris as a replacement cover company. The firm&#x27;s profits were channelled to provide funding to the group, via its Department III. The firm made a considerable profit over the years that was used by both Trepper and Gurevich as a personal expense account. Additional funding came from Soviet intelligence, and was received in monthly sums of $8,000 to $10,000 through the Russian military attaché in Paris. When the war started, the funds were sent via Switzerland in dollar amounts that were agreed in advance with Soviet intelligence via radio and delivered to Trepper. The money was used to maintain the operations of the Trepper group and to cover the necessary expenses to carry out special assignments. Trepper spent lavishly on bribes, the upkeep of the Château de Billeron, sundries, and large daily expenses to maintain his cover as a successful businessman.

====Robinson network====
In September 1941, Trepper met with Comintern agent Henry Robinson, who was one of the most important sources of intelligence in Paris. He ran his own large espionage network, which had revealed to the Soviets that Hitler was inclined to call off Operation Sea Lion, the plan to invade the British Isles. The Comintern organisation had lost prestige with Stalin, who suspected it of deviating from Communist norms. Robinson was also suspected of being an agent of the Deuxième Bureau and was subsequently in ideological conflict with Soviet intelligence. It was unusual for two senior agents to meet, but an exception was made as it was felt by Soviet intelligence that Robinson&#x27;s extensive contacts could help Trepper build his French network. Trepper learned of a radio transmitter that was being run by the French Communist Party in Paris from Robinson, and was ordered to take charge of Robinson&#x27;s network.

Around that time, Trepper was introduced to Anna Maximovitch by her brother Basil Maximovitch. Both Anna and Basil became very important to Trepper. Basil had an affair with Margarete Hoffman-Scholz, secretary to Wehrmacht colonel Hans Kuprian, who was on a committee that processed prisoners from the Vichy government for slave labour, and a niece to General Carl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel, military commander of Paris. Anna was a psychiatric neurologist who opened a clinic in Choisy-le-Roi in the late 1940s. It was a moneyed area of Paris which enabled her to pick up gossip and recruit from her patients, some of whom were high ranking French nobility and administrative people including Rohan-Chabot&#x27;s husband, Alain Louis Auguste Marie de Rohan-Chabot, who was a French officer and resistance fighter. One of those patients was Helene Claire Marie de Liencourt, Countess de Rohan-Chabot, who rented out the empty 18th-century Château Billeron located in Lugny-Champagne to Maximovitch as a meeting place for the group.

====Rue des Atrébates====
On 30 November 1941, the house at 101 Rue des Atrébates in Brussels, run by Rita Arnould and Zofia Poznańska and used to transmit intelligence, was discovered by the Funkabwehr. On 12 December 1941, the residence was raided by the Abwehr. By February 1942, Trepper re-established communication with Soviet intelligence and was able to give a full report on the situation. The Soviets instructed Trepper to contact Soviet Army Captain Konstantin Jeffremov, who had been living in Belgium. In May 1942, a meeting was arranged between the two men in Brussels, where Trepper instructed Jeffremov to take over Gurevich&#x27;s Belgian and low-countries espionage network. He also instructed him to maintain radio silence for six months, and gave Jeffremov 100,000 Belgian francs for expenses. Radio communications for the espionage group in Brussels was to be operated by GRU agent Johann Wenzel. In January 1942, Trepper ordered Gurevich to travel to Marseille with Jules Jaspar and Alfred Corbin to establish a new branch office of Simex to enable the recruitment of a new espionage network.

In May 1942, Wenzel began transmitting important traffic to the Soviet Union. On 29–30 June 1942, the house that Wenzel was transmitting from, 12 Rue de Namur in Brussels, was raided by the local police under the command of Abwehr officer Harry Piepe. Wenzel was interrogated and tortured by the Gestapo for six to eight weeks and confessed to everything, including the cypher keys he used and his code name, which allowed the Funkabwehr to decipher a large amount of back traffic belonging to the group. After Wenzel&#x27;s arrest, Jeffremov tried to hide, but was arrested on 22 July 1942 while trying to obtain false identity papers. One of the names that Wenzel surrendered was Rajchmann, who was placed under surveillance and arrested on 2 September 1942. Almost immediately, Rajchmann agreed to cooperate with the Abwehr. On 12 October 1942, Malvina Gruber, Rajchmann&#x27;s mistress was arrested by the Abwehr in Brussels, and she immediately decided to cooperate with the Abwehr. She spoke of Gurevich and exposed the Trepper espionage network in France. Jeffremov (sources vary) also exposed the Simexco company name and the Trepper espionage network in France to the Abwehr.

====Reorganisation====
When the Sokols and Johann Wenzel were arrested, Trepper lost his radio link with Soviet intelligence. Trepper asked Robinson to arrange a radio link to Soviet intelligence, but the latter refused. Trepper turned to Gurevich in Marseille and visited him several times to establish contact with the Soviets, but Gurevich refused to use his transmitter and was effectively lost to the network. Trepper was forced to turn to Pierre and Suzanne Giraud, who were established to have a transmitter either at Saint-Leu-la-Forêt or Le Pecq (sources vary) by Grossvogel and ordered to master the equipment. Suzanne had originally worked as a cutout for Trepper, and the couple were unprepared for the work; they failed and were arrested by the Gestapo.

===Arrest===
On 19 November 1942, the premises of Simexco were searched by the Abwehr, and all known associates of the company were arrested. However, no espionage material was found and the interrogation of prisoners failed to determine the whereabouts of Monsieur Gilbert, the alias that Trepper was using in his dealings with the firm. After being tortured, the French commercial director of the firm, Alfred Corbin, informed the Gestapo of the address of Trepper&#x27;s dentist, where Trepper was arrested on 25 November 1942 by Karl Giering. Trepper was imprisoned on a third floor room at 11 Rue des Saussaies in Paris. He offered to collaborate with the Abwehr, who subsequently treated Trepper leniently in the expectation that he would serve as a double agent in Paris. He was allowed to take daily walks and go into town to buy necessities, but always accompanied by two &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; guards. According to Piepe, when Trepper talked, it was not out of fear of torture or death, unlike Wenzel, but out of duty. While he gave up the names and addresses of most of the members of his own network, he sacrificed his associates to protect various members of the French Communist Party, in whom he had an absolute belief. The first people to be betrayed were his assistants Katz and Grossvogel. In 2002, author Patrick Marnham suggested Trepper not only exposed Soviet agent Henry Robinson, but may have been the source that betrayed French resistance leader Jean Moulin. When Gurevich was arrested on 9 November 1942 in Marseille, he was moved to Paris and kept in the next room to Trepper. There was a mutual animosity between the two men.

====The Great Game====
On 25 December 1942, Trepper was informed that he would be running a &quot;funkspiel&quot; that was known as &quot;Eiffel&quot;. When Trepper wrote his memoir, &quot;Le grand jeu&quot; (The Great Game), he attached such great importance to the Funkspiel as a successful operation that he considered it his greatest victory. Trepper wrote that he succeeded in turning the worst of situations in his favour by convincing the Germans that only a meeting with a PCF contact could convince Soviet intelligence that he was free. He warned Soviet intelligence of the arrests in Paris and convinced them to seriously participate in the funkspiel, so as to both poison the funkspiel communications in a way that was beneficial to the Soviets and at the same time expose German plans. However, this was complete fabrication. Trepper claimed he managed to contact Soviet intelligence which was correct, but the claim that he received a response on the 23 February is false. The 23 February date which was both detailed by VE Tarrant in &quot;The Red Orchestra&quot; and Gilles Perraults &quot;The Red Orchestra&quot; was in fact the beginning of May, when Moussier is handed the message. This meant that Trepper had been imprisoned for more 4 months, while in contact with the PCF without them knowing he was captured, while it was being investigated and hunted by the Sonderkommando.

====Funkspiel====
On 25 December 1943, the first message sent by the funkspiel, was an request for Trepper to meet with a PCF contact. The meeting fell through resulting in Jacques Duclos receiving a message from the GRU on 18 February to arrange a new meeting with PCF contact &quot;Michel&quot;. New dates were arranged for 7 or 14 March which was also missed due to Trepper changing the location. A new meeting was set for 18 or 25 April 1943, both Sundays but the treff was missed. The GRU didn&#x27;t believe that Trepper messages were part of a deception plan and continued to arrange meeting dates, although the Comintern believed he was captured and tried to warn them. By 26 May, the PCF still believed the French network had not been compromised. The message exchange proves that Trepper passed his message to Moussier in June 1943. On 5 June, Duclos confirmed that Trepper was arrested. On 7 July 1943, the first part of Trepper&#x27;s report was transmitted to Soviet intelligence by Jacques Duclos. The second part followed on 10 July. 

In June 1943, Soviet GRU officer Ivan Bolchakov conducted an analysis of the received messages from December 1942 and found that 23 out 63 were of sufficient quality and only 4 were considered valuable. It was indication of the low quality of the funkspiel operation, but it was still many weeks before the GRU realised it had been deceived.

The reasons for Trepper changing the dates in his memoir are not clear. Trepper named his associate &quot;Michel&quot; as as the person he wished to meet. However, Grojnowski ran the trade union organisation Main-d&#x27;œuvre immigrée but was not directly associated with the PCF clandestine radio transmission organisation. Bourgeois identified &quot;Michel&quot; as Roland Madigou, an intermediary between Trepper and Fernand Pauriol, the main wireless telegraphy specialist for the PCF, indicating that Trepper&#x27;s deception was designed to penetrate the PCF. Certainly the impact of the June transmission generated suspicions about Trepper&#x27;s loyalty, due to the odd way the PCF had received the report in the first place, resulting in the GRU instructing Duclos to determine how they had received it. For between four and five months, the Sonderkammado were operating against the PCF with the help of Trepper, that resulted in many GRU and PCF resistance fighters being captured.

===Escape===
On 13 September 1943, Trepper escaped Gestapo custody while visiting a pharmacy, Pharmacie Baillie, near the railway station at St. Lazare. Although he was kept under guard, he managed to slip away and avoid recapture. He contacted De Winter, and they both agreed to hide out in Le Vésinet, where he wrote to Heinz Pannwitz to explain his disappearance was not an escape, but merely an attempt to ensure he stayed alive as a move that designed to provide the maximum advantage for Soviet intelligence. On 18 September 1943, the couple moved to a house in Suresnes that belonged to Mrs. Queyrie; De Winter worked as a courier to arrange the move. Trepper wrote to Pannwitz a second time, deploring the fact that in spite of his request, a search was being made for him, and that he was placed in a very uncomfortable position. At the time, Trepper was the subject of an Identification Order in France, German and Belgium as a &quot;wanted dangerous spy&quot;.

Trepper contacted Suzanne Spaak and Jean Claude Spaak through De Winter, using the alias Jean Gilbert, in the hope that he could make contact with the French Communist Party who could send a message to the Soviet military attaché in London to warn them of the collapse of the network. Suzanne had a wide range of contacts and it was through her influence that Trepper hoped to contact Moscow. While they were waiting, De Winter organised another location where they could hide on Rue Du Chabanais, and they moved in on the 24 September.

Jean Claude had not heard from Trepper since 1942, when the Sokols had left a large sum of money, their identity, and ration cards with Spaak for safekeeping. Trepper asked Jean Claude to forward a message to one of his agents: &quot;I will be at the church every Sunday morning between 10 and 11am. Signed Martik.&quot; Trepper hoped to make contact with an agent at a church in Auteuil. Trepper sent De Winter to the treff, on several Sundays in a row, but no contact was made. The couple then moved to a guest-house at Bourg-la-Reine. Trepper, who wanted to restart his clandestine activities, was wary of De Winter being identified by the Gestapo due to her constant visits to the Spaak household. He asked Jean Claude for the 100,000 francs, that had been deposited by the Sokols which he gave to De Winter for expenses and sent her to a hideout in a village near Chartres in the hope that she could be smuggled into the non-occupied zone. De Winter was provided with a letter of introduction by Antonia Lyon-Smith, a friend of the Spaaks, to a local doctor in Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse who was with the resistance. En route, De Winter was arrested on 17 October 1943 by Pannwitz. At the same time, Trepper went to the church in Auteuil and noticed a black Citroën car — the signature car of the Gestapo — and fled.

Trepper learned the Gestapo had visited all his previous addresses and were close to capturing him. He warned Jean Claude, who sent both his wife and children to Belgium, before travelling to Paris, where he hid out with friends until the end of the war. Trepper last saw Jean Claude before the liberation of 23 October 1943.

==Postwar period==
In 1945, Trepper was related to the Soviet Union and was arrested upon arrival. From 1938, he had been under suspicion, as he was recruited by General Yan Karlovich Berzin, who had fallen out of favour and was dismissed in 1935.

Trepper was personally interrogated by SMERSH Chief Viktor Abakumov, and was interned in Lubyanka, Lefortovo, and Butyrka prison. He vigorously defended his position and managed to avoid execution, but remained in prison until 1955 for unknown reasons. After his release, he submitted a detailed plan to revive both Jewish cultural life and institutions in the Soviet Union, but the plan was rejected in 1956 after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union meeting. Afterward, he returned to Warsaw to his wife and three sons. Trepper was elected to run the Jewish cultural society Yidisher Kultur Farband and also ran its publishing house, &quot;Yiddish Bukh&quot;.

==Immigration to Israel==
After the Six-Day War in June 1967, Władysław Gomułka of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party gave an anti-Semitic diatribe, and when student unrest broke out in the spring of 1968, a state-organised antisemitic campaign began in Poland that led Trepper to begin the process of migrating to Israel.However, while the Polish communist government promoted and encouraged the emigration of thousands of Jews at that time, Trepper was continually refused a visa and placed under house arrest. Permission was refused until international pressure from worldwide publicity campaign that included his sons&#x27; protests and hunger strikes, forced the authorities to allow him and a few Jewish people who were in a similar situation to leave. He settled in Jerusalem in 1974.

==Death==
Trepper died in Jerusalem in 1982 and was buried there. According to a contemporary report from the news agency, Jewish Telegraphic Agency, &quot;no government representatives or officials attended his funeral&quot;, though the Israeli Defence Minister Ariel Sharon, later the 11th Prime Minister of Israel, subsequently awarded Trepper the Emblem of Israel in a ceremony &quot;attended by dozens of former members of anti-Nazi partisans and fighting groups&quot;.

<text>Gonzalo Daniel Sánchez de Lozada Sánchez Bustamante (born 1 July 1930), often referred to as Goni, is a Bolivian-American businessman and politician who served as the 61st president of Bolivia from 1993 to 1997 and from 2002 to 2003. A member of the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR), he previously served as minister of planning and coordination under Víctor Paz Estenssoro and succeeded him as the MNR&#x27;s national chief in 1990. 

As minister of planning, Sánchez de Lozada employed &quot;shock therapy&quot; in 1985 to cut hyperinflation from an estimated 25,000% to a single digit within a period of less than six weeks. Sánchez de Lozada was twice elected president of Bolivia, both times on the MNR ticket. During his first term (1993–1997), he initiated a series of landmark social, economic and constitutional reforms. Elected to a second term in 2002, he struggled with protests and events in October 2003 related to the Bolivian gas conflict. According to official reports, 59 protestors, ten soldiers and sixteen policemen died in confrontations. As a result of the violent clashes, Sánchez de Lozada resigned and went into exile in the United States. In March 2006, he resigned the leadership of the MNR.

The governments of Evo Morales and Luis Arce have unsuccessfully sought his extradition from the U.S. to stand trial for the events of 2003. Victims&#x27; representatives have pursued compensatory damages for extrajudicial killings in a suit against him in the United States under the Alien Tort Statute. In 2014, the U.S. District Court in Florida ruled the case could proceed under the Torture Victim Protection Act. The trial, which began on 5 March 2018 and concluded on 30 May 2018, found Sánchez de Lozada and his former defense minister Carlos Sanchez Berzaín not liable for the civilian deaths after the judge declared that there was &quot;insufficient evidence&quot;. Nevertheless, on 3 August 2020, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals vacated this ruling. On 5 April 2021, a separate U.S. District Court ruling reaffirmed a 2018 jury verdict which found both Sánchez de Lozada and Carlos Sanchez Berzaín liable and required them to pay $10 million.

==Political life==
Sánchez de Lozada&#x27;s ancestors include Daniel Sánchez Bustamante, grandfather and Minister of Foreign Affairs; Mariano Calvo, great-great-grandfather and President; and Tomás Frías, great-great-grandmother&#x27;s brother and also President.

The son of a political exile, university professor, and diplomat, Sánchez de Lozada spent his early years in the United States. He grew up in Iowa, and he attended boarding school at Scattergood Friends School in rural Iowa. He studied literature and philosophy at the University of Chicago. As a result of this experience, he speaks Spanish with a midwestern American accent. 

At the age of 21, he returned to Bolivia in 1951, on the eve of the 1952 revolution led by the MNR political party. This transformed Bolivia from a semi-feudal oligarchy to a multi-party democracy by introducing universal suffrage, nationalizing the mines of the three Tin Barons, and carrying out sweeping agrarian reform. Sánchez de Lozada pursued filmmaking and participated in several cinematic projects in the 1950s, including filming Bolivia&#x27;s 1952 Revolution. In 1954, he founded Telecine. His film &quot;Voces de la Tierra&quot; (Voices from the Earth) won First Prize for documentaries at the 1957 Edinburgh Film Festival.

In 1957, Sánchez de Lozada turned to resource businesses, founding Andean Geoservices. In 1966, he founded the mining company COMSUR, later becoming one of the most successful mining entrepreneurs in the country.

Bolivia was ruled for nearly two decades by military dictatorships. In 1979 and again in 1980, on the return to democracy, Sánchez de Lozada was elected to congress as deputy for Cochabamba. In 1985, he was elected senator from Cochabamba and then as President of the Senate of Bolivia. Soon after, President Víctor Paz Estenssoro appointed him as Planning Minister. Sánchez de Lozada oversaw a series of economic structural reforms that steered the country away from state capitalism, towards a mixed economy. He is particularly known for having sharply reduced the hyperinflation of the period, using economic shock therapy along with then Finance Minister Juan L. Cariaga Osorio, as championed by United States economist Jeffrey Sachs, then of Harvard University. 

Sánchez de Lozada ran for president in 1989 as the MNR candidate. While he won the plurality with 25.6% of the popular vote, in the congressional runoff among the top three candidates, Jaime Paz Zamora of the MIR, who had polled 21.8% of the popular vote and formerly been in third place, won the presidency. Paz Zamora was backed in the runoff by the second-placed, former military dictator Hugo Banzer of the ADN, who had won 25.2% of the popular vote. Sánchez de Lozada describes himself as a fiscal conservative and social progressive.

==First presidency (1993–1997)==
In 1993, Sánchez de Lozada again ran for president, this time in alliance with the Tupac Katari Revolutionary Liberation Movement (&quot;Movimiento Revolucionario Tupac Katari de Liberación&quot;, MRTKL), an indigenous party formed in 1985 whose leader Víctor Hugo Cárdenas was the candidate for vice-president. The MNR-MRTKL ticket won the first plurality with 36.5% of the popular vote, and Sánchez de Lozada was confirmed as president by Congress. A coalition government that included the center-left Free Bolivia Movement (MBL) and populist Civic Solidarity Union (UCS) was formed. With the 1993 electoral victory, Cárdenas became the first elected indigenous vice president in South America.

The 1993–1997 MNR-led government initiated a series of constitutional, social, economic and political reforms. The Constitution was rewritten to define Bolivia as a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural nation; the first articles enshrined indigenous rights. Other legislation included the Popular Participation Act, which decentralized the country by creating 311 (since expanded to 321) municipal governments, empowering them for local governance. The law introduced direct municipal elections for the indigenous population, and authorized local decision making on municipal spending, for which 20 percent of federal spending was guaranteed to the municipalities on a per capita basis. Other programs included educational reform, which introduced classroom teaching in the local indigenous languages, universal maternity coverage and milk and medical coverage for children up to the age of five years, and a universal old-age annual benefit. Political reforms included opening elections to independent candidates for congressional seats; and capitalization, a program which enabled the formation of joint ventures by private capital and the Bolivian people (not the Bolivian state), and requiring the private capital be invested directly in the new company.

=== Capitalization program ===
The capitalization program aimed to sell public enterprises to private companies in exchange for money. The program was meant to occur in four phases, which would include the privatization of electricity and hydrocarbon. Between 1995-1996, the five largest state enterprises were privatized: the national oil company, phone company, electric company, national airline, and train system. By 1996, the program included the privatization of water. The capitalization program was controversial: it was perceived as a privatization of five major state-owned companies that ceded management of these industries to foreign interests. Supporters believed that the requirement for private capital to be directly invested in the new joint ventures significantly reduced room for corruption. The program was intended to provide for development of these &quot;strategic&quot; resources, as the Bolivian government could not afford to do so. The revenues of the new companies were expected to yield funds for human and social, as well as infrastructure development. The dividend payouts for the Bolivian people were the foundation of a universal, annual old-age benefit, the BONOSOL. Although small on a per capita basis, it was expected to benefit primarily the rural elderly, the most marginalized sector of Bolivia&#x27;s indigenous population.

Finally, the reforms also included changes to the country&#x27;s electoral laws. A new electoral system was introduced. The change opened elections for 70 congressional seats to independent candidates who were elected by plurality, with the remaining 60 seats to be filled proportionally by members of parties reflecting the votes cast for the presidential tickets. If no presidential candidate won an absolute majority, the president would be elected in a run-off of the top two contenders. The presidential term of office was set at five years.

Critics of the program have cited loss of national funds, skyrocketing prices for locals, and social unrest associated with such changes. The sale of the national oil company resulted in millions of dollars in lost profits, compared to the price of the sale. The privatization of electricity resulted in price increases for electricity, as well. As written by Jim Shultz for the North American Congress on Latin America, &quot;The great sums promised from these sales of public assets seemed to barely trickle down into the pockets of the poor and flow freely into the coffers of the wealthy Bolivians who cut the deals—with major corruption scandals a regular fixture.&quot; Perhaps the most controversial impact was the privatization of water, which began under the government of Sánchez de Lozada and was followed by President Hugo Banzer, resulting in the Cochabamba Water War.

==Second presidency (2002–2003)==

In 2002, Sánchez de Lozada again ran for president. He chose Carlos Mesa as his running mate, an independent historian and journalist who had MNR sympathies. Sánchez de Lozada hired U.S. political consultants James Carville, Tad Devine, Stan Greenberg and Bob Shrum to advise his campaign. 

After running a sophisticated campaign, Sánchez de Lozada seemed positioned to win a strong enough plurality to form a strong government. However, three days before the elections, the U.S. ambassador publicly warned the Bolivian people against electing &quot;those who want Bolivia to again be an exporter of cocaine,&quot; as it would threaten U.S. aid to Bolivia. The people reacted in resentment, swelling the anti-U.S. vote for Evo Morales in the last three days of the campaign by 9 percent and helping him finish second after Sánchez de Lozada. Evo Morales of the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) received 20.94% of the popular vote. The center-right neo-populist candidate, Manfred Reyes of NFR placed a close third with 20.91% of the popular vote. After a difficult coalition-building process, Sánchez de Lozada was elected in a coalition formed by the MNR-MBL, MIR and UCS, the last two former members of the preceding coalition headed by the rightist, former dictator General Hugo Banzer.

When Sánchez de Lozada took office, he was faced with an economic and social crisis inherited from the preceding administration. Economic growth had plunged from the 4.8% at the end of Sánchez de Lozada&#x27;s first presidency to 0.6% in 1999 and had recovered to only 2% for 2002. The fiscal deficit was running at 8%.

===Gas War and resignation===

From his inauguration in August 2002 until the end of the year, there were fewer public tensions. In January 2003 and under the leadership of Evo Morales, a group of union leaders (Evo Morales for the &quot;cocaleros&quot;—coca growers, Jaime Solares and Roberto de la Cruz for urban workers and miners, Felipe Quispe for the indigenous farmers in the Aymara region surrounding La Paz) joined together to found the &quot;People&#x27;s High Command&quot; (Estado Mayor del pueblo). A new wave of heightened protests began; main roads were blocked, and towns and cities were brought to a standstill. Some groups aired long-standing grievances against the government; others were targeted entirely locally, protesting against decisions of the now self-governing municipalities. In February, a standoff between police demanding higher pay and army units called to protect the presidential palace suddenly ended in violence and deaths in the streets of La Paz, without articulated demands.

The acute economic crisis affected above all the urban workers and the farming/indigenous populations; their struggles gave widespread support for protests. Protests and demands became more focused: the cocaleros continued protesting against eradication of a millenary plant (coca) used to produce cocaine, although Banzer&#x27;s &quot;Coca 0&quot; policy had been replaced by the earlier subsidized crop substitution policy, in order to achieve gradual coca reduction but not total eradication. The indigenous farmers of the La Paz Aymara region pressed for political reform, to include recognition and inclusion of Bolivia&#x27;s indigenous ethnic groups as legitimate political blocs. They wanted economic de-centralization based on recognition of indigenous groups as legitimate political actors. Other demands included autonomy for their territories. By contrast, urban workers, primarily in La Paz, and miners protested against the possible proceeds of increasing natural gas production going to foreigners.

Demands rose for the government to return to the corporatist state and nationalize Bolivia&#x27;s hydrocarbon resources. Protesters demanded Sánchez de Lozada&#x27;s resignation. In late September, a convoy of buses and trucks under a police escort was bringing back to La Paz over 700 persons, including foreign tourists, after a 10-day blockade of a valley resort town. In Warisata, confrontations between protesters blocking the road and the army led to six dead, among them two soldiers and a child aged 8, shot in her own house.

A few days later, in early October, The Pacific LNG, British Petroleum and Repsol YPF had forecast an investment of three billion dollars in Chilean territory, the sale price of the gas was less than a dollar per thousand BTU and the approximate profits were one billion dollars of which the Bolivian state only received 18%, totaling 180 million dollars per year.

A few days later, in early October, it was reported that Sánchez de Lozada had decided to export Bolivia&#x27;s gas to Mexico and the United States through a Chilean port. Rancor continues to be high against Chile since Bolivia lost its coastal territory to them in the late-19th-century war of the Pacific. Protesters blockaded the main highway from the city of El Alto, Bolivia down to neighboring La Paz. A massive demonstration and virtual siege of La Paz ensued.

After three days, fuel and other essential supplies were dangerously low in La Paz. On 11 October, President Sánchez de Lozada promulgated Supreme Decree 27209, ordering the militarization of the gas plants and the transport of hydrocarbons. This decree was intended to protect private and public property, noting in the third article: &quot;whatever harm to property or persons that might be produced as an effect of fulfilling the objective of this supreme decree shall be compensated and guaranteed by the State&quot;. As a result, fully armed military troops were sent as a security force to open the way for diesel and gasoline cisterns to be transported through densely populated poor neighborhoods into La Paz.

Protesters tried to block the convoys at several points along their route. Alteño residents reported that government troops started shooting indiscriminately, killing a five-year-old child and a pregnant mother. Sánchez de Lozada and some government ministers attributed the violence to an armed &#x27;coup&#x27;, but Evo Morales and some civil groups described it as a &#x27;massacre&#x27; by government forces.

Vice-President Mesa publicly broke with Sánchez de Lozada, saying, &quot;Neither as a citizen nor as a man of principles can I accept that, faced with popular pressure, the response should be death.&quot; The Minister for Economic Development also resigned. 20,000 Bolivians began to march on La Paz, demanding the President&#x27;s resignation. Evo Morales&#x27; supporters from Cochabamba tried to march into Santa Cruz, the largest city of the eastern lowlands where support still remained for the president. They were turned back. While blaming the violence on &#x27;narco-syndicalist&#x27;, Sánchez de Lozada proposed a National Dialogue. He promised to put export plans to a national referendum, but demands for his resignation continued to rise. According to official figures, a total of 65 civilian deaths resulted from the Gas War, with around 400 persons wounded.

Faced with rising anger at the deaths, and with coalition partner Manfred Reyes Villa withdrawing political support, Sánchez de Lozada offered his resignation on 17 October in a letter to be read at an emergency session of Congress. He left on a commercially scheduled flight for the United States.

== Exile (2003–present) ==

===Trial of responsibility===
In 2004, after a concerted campaign by the families of the victims, the government and human rights groups, who gathered over 700,000 signatures on petitions, two-thirds of Bolivia&#x27;s Congress voted to authorize a &quot;Trial of Responsibility&quot; of the exiled president. It was intended to determine whether Sánchez de Lozada and his cabinet ministers should be held legally responsible for the violence of the Gas War. Supporters included many from the president&#x27;s party, reflecting a broad consensus for an impartial investigation to understand the responsibilities for the violence and deaths.

The Attorney-General&#x27;s office took testimony from twelve ministers, and carried out detailed preliminary investigations. Their work included forensic studies, crime scene investigations, and eyewitness testimony. Evo Morales, one of the key protest leaders, voluntarily offered evidence. In August 2011 the Bolivian Supreme Court sentenced five members of the military and two politicians to between three and fifteen years in prison for their role in the events of September and October 2003.

===Attempts at extradition===
On 11 November 2008, Bolivia formally served the U.S. government with a request to extradite Sánchez de Lozada to Bolivia. The request was rejected by the U.S. State Department in 2012, based on the argument that Sánchez de Lozada&#x27;s actions are not a crime in the U.S., and that no dual criminality condition existed. It said that no U.S. President could be charged for crimes done by military and police forces.

=== Civil trial in the United States ===
On 10 November 2009, the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of Florida ruled that the claims for charges of crimes against humanity against Sánchez de Lozada had no case. The court ruled that charges of extrajudicial killings could be pursued in order to allow two related U.S. cases to progress against former president Gonzalo Daniel Sánchez de Lozada de Bustamante and former Bolivian Defense Minister Jose Carlos Sánchez Berzaín.

Eight families of Bolivians killed during the 2003 protests are plaintiffs in the case. They include Etelvina Ramos Mamani and Eloy Ramos Mamani, the parents of eight-year-old Marlene, who was killed by a gunshot through her window during the military action on Warisata on 25 September 2003.

The plaintiffs in the cases, &quot;Mamani, et al. v. Sánchez de Lozada&quot;, and &quot;Mamani, et al. v. Sánchez Berzaín&quot;, seek compensatory and punitive damages under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS). On 20 May 2014, Judge James Cohn ordered that Plaintiffs&#x27; claims under the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA) could proceed because they sufficiently alleged facts that &quot;plausibly suggest that these killings were deliberate,&quot; and because they adequately alleged that Defendants were responsible for the killings. The case was stayed on 19 August 2014 pending defendants&#x27; appeal of the district court&#x27;s decision. Appellants-defendants filed their brief to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals on 14 January 2015. Plaintiffs-appellees filed their brief on 6 March 2015. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals issued their decision on 17 June 2016. On 17 April 2017, the US Supreme Court denied certiorari for the plaintiff&#x27;s appeal, clearing the way for the case to be tried.

The jury trial for the combined cases against Sánchez de Lozada and Sánchez Berzaín began on 5 March 2018 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. They were both found liable for the civilian deaths by the jury on 3 April 2018 under the TVPA claim that the deaths were extrajudicial killings. The plaintiffs were awarded $10 million in damages. On 30 May 2018, federal judge overturned the verdict of a jury by determining that a reasonable jury could not find them liable as a matter of law.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs appealed the judge&#x27;s decision, making oral arguments before the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Miami in November 2019. On 3 August 2020, a three judge panel vacated the District Court&#x27;s move to set aside the verdict, and ordered it to reconsider the matter on a new standard. It also ruled that plaintiffs were entitled to a new trial on the question of wrongful death, a matter the jury had decided in favor of the defendants. On 5 April 2021, the 2018 jury verdict, and the ordered $10 million payment, was reaffirmed by U.S. District Judge James I. Cohn after defense notions to dismiss the ruling were denied.

<doc id="255999" wikidata="Q192023" url="?curid=255999" title="Stairway to Heaven">
<text>&quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; is a song by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, released on 8 November 1971 on the band&#x27;s untitled fourth studio album (commonly known as &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;), by Atlantic Records. Composed by the band&#x27;s guitarist Jimmy Page with lyrics written by lead singer Robert Plant, it is widely regarded as one of the greatest rock songs of all time.

The song has three sections, each one progressively increasing in tempo and volume. The song begins in a slow tempo with acoustic instruments (guitar and recorders) before introducing electric instruments. The final section is an uptempo hard rock arrangement, highlighted by Page&#x27;s guitar solo and Plant&#x27;s vocals, which ends with the plaintive a cappella line: &quot;And she&#x27;s buying a stairway to heaven&quot;.

&quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; was voted number three in 2000 by VH1 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Rock Songs&quot;, in 2004 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; number 31 on its &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; list. It was the most-requested song on FM radio stations in the United States at the time, despite never having been commercially released as a single in the US. In November 2007, through download sales promoting Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Mothership&quot; release, &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; reached number 37 on the UK Singles Chart.

==Writing and recording==
The song originated in 1970 when Jimmy Page and Robert Plant were spending time at Bron-Yr-Aur, a remote cottage in Wales, following Led Zeppelin&#x27;s fifth American concert tour. According to Page, he wrote the music &quot;over a long period, the first part coming at Bron-Yr-Aur one night&quot;. Page always kept a cassette recorder around, and the idea for &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; came together from bits of taped music. The first attempts at lyrics, written by Robert Plant next to an evening log fire at Headley Grange, were partly spontaneously improvised and Page claimed, &quot;a huge percentage of the lyrics were written there and then&quot;. Page was strumming the chords, and Plant had a pencil and paper.

Led Zeppelin began recording &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; in December 1970 at Island Records&#x27; new recording studios on Basing Street in London. The song was completed by the addition of lyrics by Plant during the sessions for &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; at Headley Grange, Hampshire, in 1971. Page then returned to Island Studios to record his guitar solo.

The complete studio recording was released on &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; in November 1971. The band&#x27;s record label, Atlantic Records, wanted to issue it as a single, but the band&#x27;s manager Peter Grant refused requests to do so in both 1972 and 1973. As a result, many people bought the fourth album as if it were the single.

==Composition==
&quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; is described as progressive rock, folk rock, and hard rock. The song consists of three distinct sections, beginning with a quiet introduction on a finger-picked, six-string acoustic guitar and four recorders (ending at 2:15) and gradually moving into a slow electric middle section (2:16–5:33), then a long guitar solo (5:34–6:44), before the faster hard rock final section (6:45–7:45), ending with a short vocals-only epilogue. Plant sings the opening, middle, and epilogue sections in his mid-vocal range; he sings the hard rock section in his higher range, which borders on falsetto.

Written in the key of A minor, the song opens with an arpeggiated, finger-picked guitar chord progression with a chromatic descending bassline A-G♯-G-F♯-F. Page used a Harmony Sovereign H1260 acoustic guitar and a Fender Electric XII 12-string electric guitar played directly into the board for the rhythm parts. John Paul Jones contributed overdubbed recorders (probably soprano, alto, tenor, and bass) in the opening section (he used a Mellotron and, later, a Yamaha CP-70B Grand Piano and Yamaha GX1 to synthesise this arrangement in live performances) and a Hohner Electra-Piano electric piano in the middle section.

The sections build with more guitar layers, each complementary to the intro, with the drums entering at 4:18. The extended guitar solo in the song&#x27;s final section was played for the recording on a 1959 Fender Telecaster given to Page by Jeff Beck (an instrument he used extensively with the Yardbirds) plugged into a Supro amplifier, although in an interview he gave to &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine, Page said, &quot;It could have been a Marshall, but I can&#x27;t remember&quot;. Three different improvised solos were recorded, with Page agonising about which to keep. Page later revealed, &quot;I did have the first phrase worked out, and then there was the link phrase. I did check them out beforehand before the tape ran.&quot; He has likened the song to an orgasm. The Am–G–F–G chord sequence in the third section of the song, centred on A minor, is typical of a chord progression in the Aeolian mode.

==Personnel==
According to Jean-Michel Guesdon and Philippe Margotin:

* Robert Plant – vocals
* Jimmy Page – acoustic guitars (six-string and twelve-string), electric guitars
* John Paul Jones – bass guitar, electric piano, Mellotron, synth bass
* John Bonham – drums

==Live performances==
The inaugural public performance of the song took place at Belfast&#x27;s Ulster Hall on 5 March 1971. Bassist John Paul Jones recalls that the crowd was unimpressed: &quot;They were all bored to tears waiting to hear something they knew.&quot;

The world radio premiere of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; was recorded at the Paris Cinema on 1 April 1971, in front of a live studio audience, and broadcast three days later on the BBC. The song was performed at almost every subsequent Led Zeppelin concert, only being omitted on rare occasions when shows were cut short for curfews or technical issues. The band&#x27;s final performance of the song was in Berlin on 7 July 1980, which was also their last full-length concert until 10 December 2007 at London&#x27;s O2 Arena; the version was the longest, lasting almost 15 minutes, including a seven-minute guitar solo.
When playing the song live, the band would often extend it to over 10 minutes, with Page playing an extended guitar solo and Plant adding a number of lyrical ad-libs, such as &quot;Does anybody remember laughter?&quot;, &quot;And I think you can see that&quot;, &quot;wait a minute!&quot; and &quot;I hope so&quot;. For performing this song live, Page used a Gibson EDS-1275 double neck guitar so that he would not have to pause when switching from a six to a 12-string guitar, while John Paul Jones used a Mellotron to replicate the sound of the woodwind instruments he used on the studio recording.

By 1975, the band was using the song as its finale in concert. However, after their concert tour of the United States in 1977, Plant began to tire of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;: &quot;There&#x27;s only so many times you can sing it and mean it...It just became sanctimonious.&quot;

The song was played again by the surviving members of Led Zeppelin at the Live Aid concert in 1985; at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert in 1988, with Jason Bonham on drums; and by Jimmy Page as an instrumental version on his solo tours.

The first few bars were played alone during Page and Plant tours in lieu of the final notes of &quot;Babe I&#x27;m Gonna Leave You&quot;, and in November 1994 Page and Plant performed an acoustic version of the song at a Tokyo news station for Japanese television. &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; was also performed at Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at the O2 Arena, London on 10 December 2007.

Plant cites the most unusual performance of the song ever as being that performed at Live Aid: &quot;with two drummers (Phil Collins and Tony Thompson) while Duran Duran cried at the side of the stage – there was something quite surreal about that.&quot;

==Sunset Sound mix==
A different version of this song by Led Zeppelin is on the remastered deluxe two-CD version of &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;. Titled &quot;Stairway to Heaven &quot;, it was recorded on 5 December 1970, at Island Studio, No. 1, in London with engineer Andy Johns and assistant engineer Diggs. This version runs 8:04, two seconds longer than the original version.

==Success and legacy==
&quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; is often rated among the greatest rock songs of all time. Music journalist Stephen Davis wrote that the 1971 song ascended to &quot;anthemic&quot; status within two years. Page recalled, &quot;I knew it was good. I didn&#x27;t know it was going to become like an anthem, but I did know it was the gem of the album, sure.&quot;

&quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; continues to top radio lists of the greatest rock songs, including a 2006 &quot;Guitar World&quot; readers poll of greatest guitar solos. On the 20th anniversary of the original release of the song, it was announced via US radio sources that the song had logged an estimated 2,874,000 radio plays. As of 2000, the song had been broadcast on radio over three million times. In 1990, a Tampa Bay, Florida, area station (then WKRL) kicked off its all-Led Zeppelin format by playing &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; for 24 hours straight. It is also the biggest-selling single piece of sheet music in rock history, with an average of 15,000 copies yearly. In total, over one million copies have been sold.

The band never authorised the song to be edited for single release, despite pressure from Atlantic Records. Page told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1975, &quot;We were careful to never release it as a single&quot;, which forced buyers to buy the entire album.

In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine put it at number 31 on their list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, then number 61 in 2021. On 29 January 2009, &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine rated Jimmy Page&#x27;s guitar solo the best of the publication&#x27;s 100 Greatest Guitar Solos in Rock and Roll History.

In 2001, the New York City-based classic rock radio station WAXQ conducted a listener survey to create a countdown of 1,043 rock songs (the number corresponding with the station&#x27;s position on the dial at 104.3 FM). &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; garnered the most votes from listeners. WAXQ has conducted the survey annually since then; in each subsequent countdown that has followed, including the most recent in November 2024, &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; has been the top-ranked song.

Plant once gave $10,000 to listener-supported radio station KBOO in Portland, Oregon, during a pledge drive after the disc jockey solicited donations by promising the station would never play &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;. Plant was station-surfing in a rental car he was driving to the Oregon Coast after a solo performance in Portland and was impressed with the non-mainstream music the station presented. When asked later for the reason why, Plant replied that it wasn&#x27;t that he didn&#x27;t like the song, but he&#x27;d heard it before.

&quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry in 2023, based on its &quot;cultural, historical or aesthetic importance in the nation&#x27;s recorded sound heritage.&quot;

The carillon in the tower of Fürth&#x27;s historic town hall plays &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; daily at 12:04 pm.

==Spirit copyright infringement lawsuit==
Page&#x27;s opening acoustic guitar arpeggios bear a resemblance to the 1968 instrumental &quot;Taurus&quot; by the Los Angeles-based rock band Spirit, written by Spirit guitarist Randy California. In the liner notes to the 1996 reissue of Spirit&#x27;s self-titled debut album, California wrote: &quot;People always ask me why &#x27;Stairway to Heaven&#x27; sounds exactly like &#x27;Taurus&#x27;, which was released two years earlier. I know Led Zeppelin also played &#x27;Fresh Garbage&#x27; in their live set. They opened up for us on their first American tour.&quot;

In May 2014, Spirit bassist Mark Andes and a trust acting on behalf of California filed a copyright infringement suit against Led Zeppelin and injunction against the &quot;release of the album containing the song&quot; in an attempt to obtain a writing credit for California, who died in 1997. A lack of resources was cited as one of the reasons that Spirit did not file the suit earlier; according to a friend of California&#x27;s mother, &quot;Nobody had any money, and they thought the statute of limitations was done... It will be nice if Randy got the credit.&quot; If the Spirit lawsuit had been successful, past earnings due to the song—estimated at more than US$550 million—would not have been part of the settlement, but the publisher and composers might have been entitled to a share of future profits.

On 11 April 2016, Los Angeles district judge Gary Klausner ruled that there were enough similarities between the song and the instrumental for a jury to decide the claim, and a trial was scheduled for 10 May. The copyright infringement action was brought by Michael Skidmore, a trustee for the late guitarist, whose legal name was Randy Wolfe. On 23 June, the jury ruled that the similarities between the songs did not amount to copyright infringement. In July, Skidmore&#x27;s attorney filed a notice of appeal against the court&#x27;s decision. In March 2017, the verdict was appealed, with a main argument being that the jury should have been able to hear a recorded version of &quot;Taurus&quot;. On 28 September 2018, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit allowed the appeal, vacating in part and remanding to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California for a new trial on several evidentiary and procedural issues. On 10 June 2019, the Ninth Circuit granted rehearing &quot;en banc&quot;, meaning the case would be reheard by a larger panel of eleven judges.

A &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; article shortly after that decision noted that a Ninth Circuit judge&#x27;s interpretation of the laws implied that key elements of many classic rock songs, including &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, that were recorded prior to 1978 were not protected by copyright to begin with. The panel declared that the scope of copyright for those songs is limited to what was included in the deposit copy of the song&#x27;s sheet music provided to the Copyright Office; at trial Page had testified that the deposit copy included neither the intro that was under dispute nor his guitar solo. &quot;Bloomberg&quot; reporter Vernon Silver found that the deposit copies of other classic rock songs from that era, such as &quot;Hotel California&quot;, &quot;Born to Run&quot; and &quot;Free Bird&quot;, include only the song&#x27;s basic chords, lyrics and melody, without any solos or other distinctive musical touches. Copyright law experts could not say whether those elements are copyrighted or not; Led Zeppelin&#x27;s lawyers have argued they are even if not included in the deposit copy. Silver made an electronic mashup of several of these elements from different songs and included it with the article.

On 9 March 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, California, ruled in favour of Led Zeppelin, in that &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; does not infringe on the copyright of &quot;Taurus&quot;. The full Ninth Circuit used their decision to overturn the controversial &quot;inverse ratio rule&quot; upon which it had relied over the past several decades in past copyright rulings, stating &quot;Because the inverse ratio rule, which is not part of the copyright statute, defies logic, and creates uncertainty for the courts and the parties, we take this opportunity to abrogate the rule in the Ninth Circuit and overrule our prior cases to the contrary.&quot; This verdict immediately applied to pending cases within the Ninth: a long battle over Katy Perry&#x27;s &quot;Dark Horse&quot; in which a jury had found against her for was overturned a week after the Ninth&#x27;s verdict in &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, in part of the Ninth&#x27;s new finding and that in the case of &quot;Dark Horse&quot;, the similarity argument weighed heavily on the inverse ratio rule. On 5 October, the Supreme Court of the United States denied to grant &quot;certiorari&quot; to Andes and the trust, leaving the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s ruling in place in favour of Led Zeppelin. The court&#x27;s decision precludes further appeals, thus ending the copyright dispute.

==Claims of backmasking==
In a January 1982 broadcast of the Trinity Broadcasting Network television program &quot;Praise the Lord&quot; hosted by Paul Crouch, it was claimed that hidden messages were contained in many popular rock songs through a technique called backmasking. One example of such hidden messages that was prominently cited was in &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;. The alleged message, which occurs during the middle section of the song (&quot;If there&#x27;s a bustle in your hedgerow, don&#x27;t be alarmed now...&quot;) when played backward, was purported to contain the Satanic references: &quot;Here&#x27;s to my sweet Satan / The one whose little path would make me sad whose power is Satan, / He&#x27;ll give you, he&#x27;ll give you 666 / There was a little tool shed where he made us suffer, sad Satan.&quot;

Following the claims made in the television program, California assemblyman Phil Wyman proposed a state law that would require warning labels on records containing backmasking. In April 1982, the Consumer Protection and Toxic Materials Committee of the California State Assembly held a hearing on backmasking in popular music, during which &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; was played backward and self-described &quot;neuroscientific researcher&quot; William Yarroll claimed that the human brain could decipher backward messages.

The band itself has mostly ignored such claims. Swan Song Records responded to the allegations by stating: &quot;Our turntables only play in one direction—forwards.&quot; Led Zeppelin audio engineer Eddie Kramer called the allegations &quot;totally and utterly ridiculous. Why would they want to spend so much studio time doing something so dumb?&quot; Robert Plant expressed frustration with the accusations in a 1983 interview in &quot;Musician&quot; magazine: &quot;To me it&#x27;s very sad, because &#x27;Stairway to Heaven&#x27; was written with every best intention, and as far as reversing tapes and putting messages on the end, that&#x27;s not my idea of making music.&quot;

<text>Cerebus (; also Cerebus the Aardvark) is a comic book series, created by Canadian cartoonist Dave Sim, which ran from December 1977 until March 2004. The title character of the 300-issue series is an anthropomorphic aardvark who takes on a number of roles throughout the series—barbarian, prime minister, and pope among them. The series stands out for its experimentation in form and content, and for the dexterity of its artwork, especially after background artist Gerhard joined with the 65th issue. As the series progressed, it increasingly became a platform for Sim&#x27;s controversial beliefs.

The comic began as a parody of sword and sorcery comics, primarily Marvel&#x27;s version of Conan the Barbarian. However, it evolved to explore a variety of other topics, including politics, religion, and gender issues. At a total of 6,000 pages, it progressively became more serious and ambitious than its parodic roots. Sim announced early on that the series would end with the death of the title character. The story has a large cast of characters, many of which began as parodies of characters from comic books and popular culture.

Starting with the &quot;High Society&quot; storyline, the series became divided into self-contained &quot;novels&quot;, which form parts of the overall story. The ten &quot;novels&quot; of the series have been collected in 16 books, known as &quot;Cerebus phonebooks&quot; for their resemblance, by way of their thickness, to telephone directories. At a time when the series was about 70% completed, celebrated comic book writer Alan Moore wrote: &quot;&quot;Cerebus&quot;, as if I need to say so, is still to comic books what Hydrogen is to the Periodic Table&quot;.

==Publication history==
&quot;Cerebus&quot; was self-published by Dave Sim under his Aardvark-Vanaheim, Inc. publishing banner. For the first few years the company&#x27;s publisher was Deni Loubert, Sim&#x27;s girlfriend (the two married and divorced during the comic&#x27;s run). Sim&#x27;s position as a pioneering self-publisher in comics inspired numerous writer/artists after him, most notably Jeff Smith (&quot;Bone&quot;), Terry Moore (&quot;Strangers in Paradise&quot;), and Martin Wagner (&quot;Hepcats&quot;).

In 1979, Sim, who was at the time a frequent marijuana user, began using LSD, taking the drug with such frequency that he was eventually hospitalized. It was this incident that Sim claims led to the inspiration to produce &quot;Cerebus&quot; for 300 monthly issues.

When Sim published the first &quot;Cerebus&quot; &quot;phone book&quot;, a paperback collection of the &quot;High Society&quot; graphic novel (Issues #26–#50), he angered distributors—who felt that their support had been instrumental in his series&#x27; success in an industry generally indifferent to small publishers—by offering the first printing via mail order only. The decision was a financial windfall for Sim, however, grossing over $150,000 in sales (). Sim became known for picking up hotel tabs for self-publishers and helping other self-publishers by paying for meals and limo service between stops. Negotiations regarding DC buying &quot;Cerebus&quot; took place over the course of 1985 to 1988, offering $100,000 ($ today) and 10% of all licensing and merchandising, which Sim rejected.

The series hit a personal sales record with issue #100 which, despite being a normal issue in the middle of a story arc, had a print run of 36,000 copies. Sales took a substantial drop over the next 50 issues, however, and Sim commented that the fact that readers could not simply &quot;jump in&quot; to &quot;Cerebus&quot;, and had to read the entire series in order to be able to understand the current issue, was a major reason for the sales drop.

In July 1984, &quot;Cerebus&quot; publisher Aardvark-Vanaheim was threatened with possible legal action by Marvel Comics over a parody of Wolverine in &quot;Cerebus&quot;.

When Sim guest-wrote the 10th issue of Todd McFarlane&#x27;s comics series &quot;Spawn&quot;, he donated his entire fee—over $100,000—to the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund.

&quot;Jaka&#x27;s Story&quot;, a tragic character study dealing with gender roles and the political suppression of art, is generally cited as the series&#x27; pinnacle of narrative achievement. Later issues of the series became highly personal, and began to alienate many long-time fans, female readers especially. Issue #186 (collected in &quot;Reads&quot;) contained a lengthy prose section that was attacked by some readers and critics for what they perceived as overt misogyny, and which Sim describes as &quot;anti-feminism&quot;. During this part of the story, the storyline consisted of a textual treatise written by Viktor Davis, a fictional &quot;Reads&quot; author, interspersed with the main &quot;Cerebus&quot; storyline. In Davis&#x27;s material, he refers to the &quot;creative male light&quot; and the &quot;emotional female void&quot;, a reversal of the gender-based view of creation espoused by the Judge at the end of &quot;Church and State&quot; (in which the &quot;female light&quot; is raped by the &quot;male void&quot; and shatters into the physical universe). As Sim himself says in an interview with &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;, &quot;&quot;Cerebus&quot; #1–200 [is] the completion of the story. The yin and yang. The ultra-female reading. The ultra-male reading. I&#x27;m attaching an allegory to the Big Bang. You make up your mind which one&#x27;s the pit and which one&#x27;s the top of the mountain.&quot; By the end of the series, the Void is again male and identified as God, and the Light is female, now identified with YHWH. issue #186 was followed by another essay in the back of issue #265 called &quot;Tangent&quot;, in which Sim identified a &quot;feminist/homosexualist axis&quot; that opposed traditional and rational societal values. This material appeared as Sim was retreating from public life and becoming more marginalized by his peers in the industry.

Sim himself appeared as a character in &quot;Cerebus&quot;, as when he berated the title character in the &quot;Minds&quot; story arc.

Sim&#x27;s religious beliefs heavily influenced the last third of &quot;Cerebus&quot; storyline. Once an atheist, Sim became a believer in God while gathering research material for &quot;Rick&#x27;s Story&quot;. However, rather than following an established religion, Sim follows his own personal belief system cobbled together from elements of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, although he described himself in issue #8 of &quot;Following Cerebus&quot; as &quot;mostly Muslim&quot;. A 2003 magazine interview describes Sim as reciting a prayer of his own devising five times a day (which was published in the back of issue #300), and as having sold much of his furniture to donate the money to charity as an act of religious asceticism. In an editorial contained in issue #297, Sim stated that he regards the production of &quot;Cerebus&quot; as of secondary importance to his religious practice. Sim&#x27;s religious beliefs tie into his views on gender, and the bulk of the &quot;Cerebus&quot; storyline after &quot;Guys&quot; deals with this, especially &quot;Rick&#x27;s Story&quot;, &quot;Latter Days&quot;, and &quot;The Last Day&quot;.

A quarterly publication, &quot;Following Cerebus&quot;, followed in August 2004, featuring correspondence, essays, and previously unpublished artwork from Sim, as well as interviews with other comic writers and artists.

Sim was rumored to have said that had he died or otherwise chosen not to complete &quot;Cerebus&quot; prior to issue #300, the remaining issues were to either consist of blank pages or Gerhard was to have drawn his backgrounds only, leaving Sim&#x27;s contribution blank. It is not known if this plan was ever serious, since it was never put into effect. At the completion of the series, Sim directed that upon his and Gerhard&#x27;s death, &quot;Cerebus&quot; would enter into the public domain. Effective 31 December 2006, Sim purchased Gerhard&#x27;s share of the company. Sim has already granted a general license for other creators to use his characters in their own works, stating that he is trying to be consistent with his own appropriation of others&#x27; works.

In early 2009, Sim launched the bimonthly series &quot;Cerebus Archive&quot;. It was translated into Italian; and in 2011, &quot;Church and State Vol. I&quot; was published in Spanish.

==Published volumes==
===&quot;Cerebus&quot;===
Issues #1–25.

This first story arc, uniquely in this series, consists of one to three-issue storylines with only occasional back-references. Cerebus is introduced as an amoral barbarian mercenary, fighting (and betraying) for money and drinking it away. During his adventures, he encounters the warrior Pigts (whose religion reveres aardvarks) and the insane wizard Necross, who turns himself into a giant stone Thrunk (visually similar to Marvel Comics&#x27; The Thing). Most of the series&#x27; prominent characters are introduced (or at least mentioned) in these issues, including Elrod of Melvinbone (a parodic representation of Michael Moorcock&#x27;s Elric of Melniboné), Lord Julius, a character based upon Julius &quot;Groucho&quot; Marx, Artemis Roach (a.k.a. The Roach, who would evolve into an all-purpose parody of Marvel and DC superhero characters) and Jaka. The series takes a sharp change in direction with issue #20 which is the first of the &quot;Mind Games&quot; issues that are a feature of the comic and introduces the philosophical Suenteus Po and the ultra-matriarchial Cirinists.

===&quot;High Society&quot;===
Issues #26–50.

Cerebus comes to the wealthy city-state of Iest as the representative of Lord Julius&#x27;s city-state of Palnu. He quickly finds himself enmeshed in the fast-paced world of high finance and politics, and comic tension is built through his ignorance of the &quot;high society&quot; machinations going on around him. Cerebus is befriended by the legendary Regency Elf as he adjusts to his new circumstances. He meets and soon finds himself maneuvered into a political campaign by the mysterious Astoria, who is also manipulating Artemis into pseudo-super hero identities that are parodies of Moon Knight and later Sergeant Preston of the Mounties. Cerebus recognizes that he is a pawn in a political game between Lord Julius and Astoria, but he struggles to assert himself and ultimately confounds the expectations of everyone attempting to use him. Cerebus is eventually elected Prime Minister of Iest, but launches an unnecessary war of conquest that causes him to lose everything.

===&quot;Church &amp; State I&quot;===
Issues #52–80.

After some travels, Cerebus returns to Iest and is manipulated by Weisshaupt, who wants to use Cerebus&#x27;s popularity with the masses, into again becoming Prime Minister of Iest. Weisshaupt has maneuvered himself into the tenuous presidency of a federation of states (including Iest, Palnu and New Sepra) as a bulwark against the Cirinists. Weisshaupt lures Cerebus into a drunken marriage to Red Sophia, but ultimately loses his influence over Cerebus when Weisshaupt&#x27;s rival, Bishop Powers, appoints Cerebus Pope of the Eastern Church of Tarim. Finally out from under anyone else&#x27;s control, Cerebus lets absolute power go to his head and demands that all the citizens must give him all their gold or face the end of the world. Sophia walks out on Cerebus, and then he discovers that Jaka is married and pregnant. Cerebus is threatened by Weisshaupt&#x27;s secret invention of cannons, but Weisshaupt suffers a heart attack and Cerebus continues his papal reign of terror. He is finally ejected from the Upper City by the sudden invasion of the giant stone Thrunk, who claims to be the God Tarim.

===&quot;Church &amp; State II&quot;===
Issues #81–111.

Cerebus returns to Iest&#x27;s Upper City and uses Weisshaupt&#x27;s cannons to destroy Thrunk and reclaim the papacy. Astoria has mysteriously killed the Western pope (&quot;the Lion of Serrea&quot;), and Cerebus must execute her for the crime in order to retain his papacy. Cerebus confronts her in a dungeon, and after being taunted by Astoria, he grants himself a divorce from Red Sophia, marries himself to Astoria, rapes her, and then divorces himself from her. Astoria&#x27;s trial, which echoes with similarities to a repeating pattern of historical executions of reformers, is interrupted when Cerebus makes the predicted Ascension to the Moon that is the culmination of the land&#x27;s religious prophecy. There, Cerebus meets the Judge, a timeless, godlike being who has watched over history from the very beginning. (Sim had based the personality of this character on cartoonist and playwright Jules Feiffer.) The Judge explains his version of the creation myth of Cerebus&#x27;s universe, before warning Cerebus that he will live only a few more years before dying &quot;alone, unmourned and unloved&quot;. The Judge tells Cerebus that if the Aardvark ever questions his suffering, he should remember his &quot;second marriage&quot; to Astoria. Cerebus then falls back to earth, where he discovers that the Cirinists have invaded, and his empire has collapsed.

===&quot;Jaka&#x27;s Story&quot;===
Issues #114–136.

Cerebus returns to Iest, now under a brutal Cirinist dictatorship, and runs into Jaka again. She is illegally working as a dancer in her landlord&#x27;s tavern. The landlord/barman, Pud, treats Jaka kindly but secretly spends his days lusting after her. Cerebus agrees to live with Jaka and her husband Rick as their houseguest. That story is interwoven with unreliable tales of Jaka&#x27;s childhood told by a writer, representing Oscar Wilde, using notes and stories provided by Rick. In the end Cerebus disguises himself and travels to the Lower City to buy a jar of paint. While he is gone, the Cirinists find the tavern, kill Pud and arrest Jaka, Rick, and Oscar. Jaka is made to sign a confession of immoral behavior, and is reunited with Rick; however, the Cirinists reveal to Rick that Jaka aborted the son that Rick always wanted. He lashes out at Jaka and is allowed to divorce her (although he is maimed for striking her). Jaka returns to Palnu, and Cerebus returns to the inn to find it in ruins.

===&quot;Melmoth&quot;===
Issues #139–150.
This story arc concentrates on the last days and death of Oscar Wilde (who is attended to by his trusted companion Robbie Ross) rather than on Cerebus himself, who appears in only a few pages. (The title refers to the gothic novel &quot;Melmoth the Wanderer&quot; by Charles Robert Maturin, a relative of Wilde&#x27;s. Wilde adopted this alias during this period of his life.) Meanwhile, a catatonic Cerebus, believing Jaka to be dead, spends his days mourning on the patio of a café. In the last few pages of the story, after the main action had concluded, Cerebus overhears a conversation by two Cirinist jailers insulting Jaka. Enraged, Cerebus murders one of the guards and then springs into action.

===&quot;Flight&quot;===
Issues #151–162.

First part of the &quot;Mothers &amp; Daughters&quot; story arc. Cerebus&#x27;s return to Iest and slaughter of Cirinsts leads to a very brief failed revolution. Cerebus descends into darkness and speaks with Suenteus Po. Meanwhile, Cirin works to manage her sect and arrange her own Ascension. Artemis, with Elrod as his sidekick, also stages his own impromptu revolution under his new persona &quot;PunisherRoach&quot;, a parody of the Marvel comics character the Punisher.

===&quot;Women&quot;===
Issues #163–174.

Second part of the story-arc &quot;Mothers &amp; Daughters&quot;. Cerebus crashes back to earth. He is assisted by a mysterious old woman who is being openly spied upon by the Cirinists; she sends him to a bar to hide. This story arc includes a parody of Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot; in which the Roach plays &quot;Swoon&quot; (a parody of Dream) and Elrod plays &quot;Snuff&quot; (a trans person parody of Death). Astoria and Cirin symbolically duel in a dream realm. The book includes excerpts from books written by Astoria and Cirin that describe their differing beliefs. Cerebus flies across the city to slay Astoria, but is interrupted by the arrival of Suenteus Po.

===&quot;Reads&quot;===
Issues #175–186.

Third part of the &quot;Mothers &amp; Daughters&quot; story arc. This book primarily consists of two long text pieces. The first revolves around an author of &quot;Reads&quot;, heavily illustrated books in Cerebus&#x27;s world. In this story, there is a strong thread about the dangers of commercial success and &quot;selling out&quot;. The series moves from this storyline to a long essay attributed to Viktor Davis, a fictional &quot;Reads&quot; author. This essay puts forth a theory on the nature of the sexes, describing the &quot;Female Void&quot; focused on feeling, and the &quot;Male Light&quot; focused on reason. These two stories are accompanied by a long discussion between Cirin, Astoria, Cerebus, and Suenteus Po. Po gives information about aardvarks, including that all aardvarks have Cerebus&#x27;s &quot;magnifier&quot; quality, and attempts to convince each of the others to abandon their pursuits of power and return to what they enjoy doing most, then leaves them to their fates. Astoria is convinced and also leaves, but not before giving Cerebus information about her history with Cirin and also informing him of his hermaphrodite nature. Cerebus and Cirin then engage in a long and brutal fight, which leads to the beginning of another ascension.

===&quot;Minds&quot;===
issue #187–200.

Fourth and concluding part of the &quot;Mothers &amp; Daughters&quot; story arc. Cerebus and Cirin ascend, then are separated by a mysterious force. As Cerebus flies through the solar system, he is shown images from his past and is forced to reconsider his actions and his faith. He then encounters a disembodied voice calling itself &quot;Dave&quot; that acknowledges itself as Cerebus&#x27;s creator. &quot;Dave&quot; shows Cerebus the history of the Cirinist movement, revealing that Cirin is actually named Serna and was the best friend of the real Cirin (the old woman Cerebus encountered in &quot;Women&quot;), but usurped Cirin&#x27;s leadership and effectively exchanged identities with her. &quot;Dave&quot; then gives Cerebus information about his past, showing that Cerebus unwittingly ruined his original destiny, causing chaotic repercussions which have influenced most of his adventures. Cerebus demands that &quot;Dave&quot; &quot;make&quot; Jaka love him; in response, &quot;Dave&quot; shows Cerebus visions of possible futures between himself and Jaka, all of which are disastrously flawed for both of them due to Cerebus&#x27;s nature. After a period of penance and self-reflection on Pluto, Cerebus asks &quot;Dave&quot; to place him in a bar he remembers from his mercenary days.

===&quot;Guys&quot;===
Issues #201–219.

Cerebus spends time, and eventually becomes bartender, in one of the Cirinists&#x27; bars where &quot;degenerate&quot; men are essentially quarantined from the female citizens. Described in the trade paperback&#x27;s introduction as based on a bar that Sim frequented during a near-alcoholic stint between relationships, the series features various parodic characters who come and go while Cerebus remains stationary. Cerebus begins a somewhat reluctant relationship with a woman named Joanne, who was first introduced in one of the possible futures with Jaka that &quot;Dave&quot; showed Cerebus in &quot;Minds&quot;.

===&quot;Rick&#x27;s Story&quot;===
Issues #220–231.

Eventually Jaka&#x27;s ex-husband Rick arrives at the bar. He has significantly aged, become a heavy drinker (having barely been able to tolerate alcohol in &quot;Jaka&#x27;s Story&quot;), and it is gradually revealed that the mental and emotional scars from the events at the end of &quot;Jaka&#x27;s Story&quot; have left him mildly insane. Rick is working on a book about his life, which gradually becomes a religious work in which Cerebus is a holy figure and Rick his follower. Joanne returns and taunts Cerebus by courting Rick. At the end of the book, Rick departs, for reasons not entirely clear, and tells Cerebus that he will see Rick only once more in his life. After Rick has left, Jaka shows up at the bar, and she and Cerebus depart together, heading for Cerebus&#x27;s childhood home of Sand Hills Creek.

===&quot;Going Home&quot;===
Issues #232–250.

First part of the &quot;Going Home&quot; story arc. Cerebus and Jaka travel across land, then on a river boat. Cerebus is eager to make as much time as possible, as he fears being trapped in the mountains near Sand Hills Creek by winter, but instead he indulges Jaka&#x27;s desire for shopping and public appearances. Along the way, they encounter veiled hostility from the Cirinists. Cerebus and Jaka&#x27;s relationship begins to show signs of deterioration, and Jaka is almost tempted away by F. Stop Kennedy (a fictional version of F. Scott Fitzgerald), a writer who has accompanied them on their river boat.

===&quot;Form &amp; Void&quot;===
Issues #251–265.

Second and concluding part of the story arc &quot;Going Home&quot;. Cerebus and Jaka continue their journey towards Sand Hills Creek, in the company of Ham and Mary Ernestway, analogues to Ernest Hemingway and his fourth wife, Mary. On the trip, Mary tells them about some of her and Ham&#x27;s journeys. This material is based on Mary Hemingway&#x27;s journals about Ernest&#x27;s last African safaris prior to his death. Ham dies in what appears to be suicide, but Cerebus becomes convinced Mary murdered him and flees in panic, taking Jaka with him. They discover that they have been traveling in circles without making any significant progress toward Sand Hills Creek, and nearly die in a blizzard. They finally arrive in Sand Hills Creek only to find that Cerebus&#x27;s parents are dead and the rest of the community has shunned Cerebus for his perceived abandonment of his family. Cerebus drives Jaka away, blaming her for keeping him away too long.

===&quot;Latter Days&quot;===
Issues #266–288.

First part of the story arc &quot;Latter Days&quot;. After a prodigious leap in time over two issues, Cerebus returns from the north intent on provoking the Cirinists into killing him. Instead, he is captured by a trio of characters based on the Three Stooges, who await a religious revelation from him. While Cerebus was in the north, a religious movement developed out of the teachings of Rick and his writings about Cerebus. Once Cerebus supplies the required revelation, he inspires a successful anti-Cirinist rebellion and a subsequent reordering of society. Much of the second half of this chapter consists of Cerebus giving a highly idiosyncratic analysis of the Torah. Published over the course of nearly a year, this section, called &quot;Chasing YHWH&quot;, was presented almost entirely in text format, with minimal art. This story arc is unusual in that disembodied thought balloons give the impression that Cerebus is speaking directly to the reader at times. It is revealed in the last issue of the arc that Cerebus has been talking to a female reporter who bears a striking resemblance to Jaka. He eventually falls in love with the woman and marries her.

===&quot;The Last Day&quot;===
Issues #289–300.

The second and concluding part of &quot;Latter Days&quot;, and the conclusion of the series as a whole. In the first 40 pages Cerebus has a dream or vision in which cosmology is seen as a reflection of theology, complete with explanatory footnotes by Sim. Upon waking Cerebus—now incredibly aged, decrepit, pain-wracked, and mildly senile—makes the laborious trek to his writing desk to write down his new revelation. He then hides the manuscript, and it is implied that nobody will find it for two thousand years.

Cerebus spends most of the rest of the book trying to persuade his chief of security, Walter O&#x27;Reilly (named after Corporal Walter (Radar) O&#x27;Reilly from &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;), to admit his son, Shep-Shep, with whom he remembers sharing an idyllic father–son relationship. However, the Sanctuary is under lockdown due to opposition from a new and even more rabidly &quot;feminist-homosexualist&quot; group led by Shep-Shep&#x27;s mother, whom Cerebus refers to as &quot;New Joanne&quot;, which favors such &quot;rights&quot; as pedophilia, zoophilia, juvenile recreational drug use and lesbian motherhood. As a result, social values have undergone a complete breakdown.

Cerebus finally goes to bed despairing of seeing his son again, but Shep-Shep manages to sneak into Cerebus&#x27;s room late that night. Their subsequent conversation shatters Cerebus&#x27;s last illusions about his son. Shep-Shep has aligned himself with his mother, who has been conducting genetic engineering experiments, partly with knowledge gained from Cirin&#x27;s earlier experimentation. Cerebus is disgusted and horrified when Shep-Shep shows him the results of one of the experiments, a lion cub with a human baby&#x27;s head, and explains his mother&#x27;s plans.

As Shep-Shep leaves, Cerebus grabs a knife, intending to kill him, but falls out of bed and breaks his neck. He dies alone, unmourned, and unloved, just as the Judge had predicted. His life flashes before his eyes in a series of flashback panels and his ghost sees many of his old friends and enemies waiting for him in &quot;the Light&quot;. Jaka, Bear, and Ham beckon to him, and he eagerly rushes to join them, thinking they are in Heaven, but then he notices the absence of Rick and realizes that the Light may in fact be Hell. He calls out to God for help, but is dragged into the Light nonetheless.

===&quot;Cerebus in Hell?&quot;===
In 2017, Sim started publishing a new series, &quot;Cerebus in Hell?&quot;, with issues #0 and #1 through #4. Cerebus, having died in &quot;Cerebus&quot; #300, is now in what appears to be Hell, wandering—and, as usual, badmouthing—his way, with art by Gustave Doré swiped from that artist&#x27;s famous illustrations for Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. Small pictures of Cerebus, copied from the &quot;Cerebus&quot; comic book, with only a few poses repeated throughout, are added to the art.

===&quot;Cerebus&quot; #1s===
Starting in August 2017, Dave Sim began to write and publish a series of monthly comic books, all numbered &quot;#1&quot;, and all satires of various classic comic books. The first, &quot;Batvark&quot; #1, is a satire of &quot;Batman&quot; #1, the second, &quot;Aardvark Comics&quot; #1, a satire of &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1. As with &quot;Cerebus in Hell&quot;, the artwork is by Gustave Doré with small pictures of Cerebus added.

==Characters==
===Cerebus===
Cerebus is a misanthropic, amoral, anthropomorphic bipedal gray aardvark, although like other anthropomorphic characters in the series, he was born to ordinary human parents. He refers to himself by name, in the third person, with occasional exceptions in the early issues and later intentional uses of the first-person pronoun when Cerebus makes speeches while campaigning for office. Although Cerebus identifies as male and is treated as such, biologically, he is hermaphroditic. Possessing both sexes&#x27; genitalia and reproductive systems, Cerebus is theoretically capable of impregnating himself. However, a childhood injury to his uterus makes this impossible.

===Supporting characters===
; Jaka Tavers :The love of Cerebus&#x27;s life. A dancer by profession, she is the niece of Lord Julius and (ex-)wife of Rick Nash.
; Lord Julius : Grandlord of the city-state of Palnu, who exercises control by making the bureaucracy incredibly dense and incomprehensible. Julius is crafty and intelligent, but often plays the fool to confuse and baffle opponents. His character design and behavior is based on Groucho Marx, including snappy insults, a constant cigar, the chicken walk, and a painted-on mustache.
; Astoria :A beautiful political manipulator, Lord Julius&#x27; ex-wife, and the main driving force behind Cerebus&#x27;s campaign to become prime minister in &quot;High Society&quot;. She is the leader of the Kevillists, a feminist sect which opposes Cirin. The Kevillists mirror the Cirinists&#x27; philosophy, but would prefer power in the hands of daughters instead of mothers. She is named for actress Mary Astor, and may be inspired in some ways by Sim&#x27;s ex-wife Deni Loubert, though Sim himself denies this in issue 298.
; Cirin : Leader of the Cirinists, a matriarchal fascist sect which conquers Estarcion at the conclusion of the &quot;Church and State&quot; storyline. Originally named Serna, she took the name and effectively exchanged identities with the &quot;real&quot; Cirin, whose views were much less militaristic. The sect honors mothers primarily, also giving high honors to daughters (potential mothers) and children. Men are tolerated. Like Cerebus, she is an aardvark.
; Elrod the Albino (Elrod of Melvinbone):Essentially Michael Moorcock&#x27;s Elric of Melnibone with the voice and personality of Senator Claghorn (or Foghorn Leghorn), Elrod is an almost purely comic character whose main purpose is to frustrate and enrage Cerebus. In &quot;Reads&quot; it is revealed that he was created by Cerebus&#x27;s proximity to a magic gem, and after learning this he vanishes from existence. However, Joanne tells Cerebus she and her husband used to live next door to Elrod, who was married at the time to Red Sophia.
; Roach (Artemis):An incompetent superhero character. Sim used the Roach to satirize popular mainstream comic characters or industry publishing trends, beginning with Batman. His other guises have included Captain Cockroach (Captain America), Moonroach (Moon Knight), Wolveroach (Wolverine), the Secret Sacred Wars Roach (Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars series and Frank Miller&#x27;s Batman from &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;), (Valentino&#x27;s normalman), Punisherroach (the Punisher), Swoon (The Sandman), and Sergeant Preston of the Royal Mounted Iestan police (the main character of the radio series &quot;Challenge of the Yukon&quot;).
; Adam Weisshaupt : Introduced in &quot;Cerebus&quot;, he is a ruthless political opponent of Cerebus throughout the &quot;Church &amp; State&quot; storyline. His manipulations of both Cerebus and the Roach lead to his pawns eventually growing more powerful than he ever hoped to be. Weisshaupt is named after the historical Adam Weishaupt but drawn to look like George Washington (a connection well known to Illuminati conspiracy theorists).
; Bear : Cerebus&#x27;s best friend from his mercenary days and main drinking buddy. In &quot;Guys&quot; there are hints Cerebus is suppressing an attraction to him.
; Joanne :Introduced in a possible future for Cerebus and Jaka by &quot;Dave&quot; in &quot;Minds&quot;, Joanne is a bored housewife who has an affair with Cerebus, prompting Jaka&#x27;s suicide. After Cerebus returns to Estarcion, Joanne reappears and becomes Cerebus&#x27;s lover, only to be spurned by Cerebus. She later seduces Rick as a way to taunt Cerebus. Joanne is in many ways an opposite of Jaka, and Cerebus bases much of his post-&quot;Guys&quot; views on how to deal with women on his experience with her. After Shep-shep&#x27;s mother leaves Cerebus, he labels her &quot;New Joanne&quot;.
; Bran Mac Mufin:Originally a barbarian warlord whose people worshiped an idol who looked remarkably like Cerebus (and which the aardvark destroyed). He later turns up quite unexpectedly, in civilized clothing, to act as an adviser to Cerebus in two separate occasions, first in Cerebus&#x27;s campaign and first reign as Prime Minister of Iest and then arriving after Cerebus is pope to observe the miracles and give Cerebus advice, though he seems to have a hidden agenda. During the Iest campaign Cerebus states that he trusts Mac Mufin&#x27;s military advice more than anyone else&#x27;s. When Thrunk deposes Cerebus, Mac Mufin commits suicide by stabbing himself in the chest with a sword. Mac Mufin is a parody of Robert E. Howard&#x27;s Celtic barbarian Bran Mak Morn. In his first appearance in issue #5 his name was spelled Bran Mak Mufin, but in subsequent appearances he goes by Bran Mac Mufin.
; Rick Nash : First introduced as Jaka&#x27;s husband in &quot;Jaka&#x27;s Story&quot;, Rick is a friendly, gentle ne&#x27;er-do-well, whom Sim described in the introduction to the &quot;phonebook&quot; of &quot;Jaka&#x27;s Story&quot; as &quot;the nearest I will ever come to the portrayal of a good and thoroughly decent human being; completely without guile or malice&quot;. After his marriage to Jaka is dissolved, he becomes mildly insane. He eventually goes on to become the prophet of a religion centered on Cerebus.
; Suenteus Po:Estarcion&#x27;s third aardvark, who has lived several lifetimes and has shaped the history of Estarcion. It is also a very common name and several people named &quot;Suenteus Po&quot; appear in the story in various roles—one as an enigmatic illusionist and another as a historian who narrates a sizable portion of Cerebus&#x27;s first reign as Prime Minister of Iest (though it is very strongly implied that both these Pos are the aardvark). It is mentioned in &quot;High Society&quot; that some of the followers of the original Suenteus Po named their children after him. The name may be a playful misspelling of the name of Roman historian Suetonius. There was a rock band on San Francisco label Solana Records named Suenteus Po that released an album in 2000.
; The Regency Elf :A childlike, playful spirit who inhabits Cerebus&#x27;s rooms at the Regency Hotel in &quot;High Society&quot;; at first, only Cerebus can see her. She helps Cerebus with some of his political scheming, though, as innocent as she seems, it&#x27;s all just a game to her. It is discovered later that the Regency Elf who appears to Cerebus is a fake created by Cerebus&#x27;s subconscious. The Regency Elf is inspired in part by &quot;Elfquest&quot; and its creator Wendy Pini. Visually, the Regency Elf is inspired by Debbie Harry.

Various other characters in the series were designed to resemble famous actors, politicians, and other personalities and comic in-jokes, including British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Professor X (with a bit of Chris Claremont thrown in), Canadian Member of Parliament Sheila Copps, director Woody Allen, Alan Moore, Rick Veitch, Oscar Wilde, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Norman Mailer, Rodney Dangerfield, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and Chico Marx.

==Collections==
The first 25 issues of &quot;Cerebus&quot; were collected in six issues of &quot;Swords of Cerebus&quot;, plus one supplement to vol. 6, and these stories were then collected in the &quot;Cerebus&quot; trade paperback. &quot;Swords of Cerebus&quot; also published several new short Cerebus stories, listed under &quot;Other appearances&quot; above, which were not reprinted in the &quot;phone books&quot;

All of the story arcs from the Cerebus comic book have been reprinted in collected omnibus editions of 240–630 pages each, all of which are presently still in print. They are generally referred to by fans and retailers as &quot;Cerebus&quot; &quot;phone books&quot; due to their size; also, they use the same newsprint paper as the original comics.

Sim has released two collections of his responses to readers&#x27; letters (the original letters are not included) after the publication of &quot;Cerebus&quot; #300. &quot;Collected Letters 2004&quot; () was released in 2005, and &quot;Collected Letters vol. 2&quot; was released in 2007 ().

Miscellaneous stories not appearing in the above collections have been reprinted in the short collections &quot;Cerebus World Tour Book&quot; and in &quot;Cerebus Number Zero&quot;, which reprints Issues #51, #112/#113 and parts of Issues #137–#138. A few standalone, uncollected stories have appeared in various collections and magazines over the years, and Cerebus has made cameo appearances on the covers of magazines such as &quot;Comics Revue&quot;. Sim also marketed a set of &quot;Diamondback&quot; cards (based upon a game seen in early issues) in the 1980s. All of the material in the &quot;Cerebus&quot; arc was reprinted in smaller collections called &quot;Swords of Cerebus&quot; before Sim decided on the &quot;phonebook&quot; format.

The phonebooks themselves tie into ideas presented in the series. Although grammatically incorrect, the titles of books 8 through 11 could be read as a sentence (&quot;women read minds, guys&quot;—the concept of women reading minds is a key plot point). Also, beginning with &quot;Going Home&quot; (the first storyline begun after Sim&#x27;s religious conversion), the covers of each &quot;phone book&quot; are printed in full color, with &quot;Going Home&quot; and &quot;Form and Void&quot; using Gerhard&#x27;s scenic nature photography as covers, rather than the drawings used on past books.

==Reception and legacy==
Cerebus has been rated to be one of the greatest characters in comics history. &quot;Wizard&quot; rated him as the 63rd-greatest comic book character, while &quot;Empire&quot; rated him as the 38th-greatest comic book character, describing him as a character born of bizarre brilliance. &quot;IGN&quot; placed Cerebus as the 91st-greatest comic book hero of all time, stating that &quot;few names hold as much sway in the independent comics scene as Cerebus&quot; and &quot;Cerebus&#x27; mark on the industry will be everlasting&quot;.

The term &quot;Cerebus syndrome&quot; has come to commonly describe developments where initially comedic or superficial works in any medium gradually become more serious, complex, and dramatic.

Over a decade after the end of the comic book series, an author named Michael Fryar published a science fiction novel titled &quot;Wasted Genius: A Flaherty Story&quot; which features Cerebus as a character.

In Season 9, Episode 5 of &quot;The Office (American TV series)&quot;, the character Dwight Schrute is seen dressed as Cerebus for Halloween.

<text>Michelle Christine Trachtenberg (October 11, 1985 – February 26, 2025) was an American actress. After beginning her career in TV commercials at age three, she made her television debut in her first credited role on the Nickelodeon series &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot; (1994–1996). As a child actress, Trachtenberg starred in multiple Nickelodeon productions. In 1997, she won a Young Artist Award for her performance as Maggie in CBS&#x27;s &quot;Meego&quot;.

Trachtenberg found success on the supernatural drama series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (2000–2003) as Dawn Summers, the younger sister of the show&#x27;s eponymous protagonist, a role which won her another Young Artist Award and earned her three Saturn Award nominations. She was also nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for her role as the host of the Discovery Kids series &quot;Truth or Scare&quot; (2001–2003). In her late teens and early 20s, Trachtenberg rose to further prominence in the film &quot;EuroTrip&quot; (2004) and as Georgina Sparks on the CW series &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; (2008–2012). During the mid-2000s, she also had a starring role in the film &quot;Ice Princess&quot; (2005) and supporting roles in the films &quot;Mysterious Skin&quot; (2004) and &quot;Black Christmas&quot; (2006). She also starred on the NBC series &quot;Mercy&quot; (2009–2010) as Chloe Payne.

In the 2010s, Trachtenberg starred in several television films, including &quot;Killing Kennedy&quot; (2013) and &quot;Sister Cities&quot; (2015), and in the science fiction film &quot;The Scribbler&quot; (2014). She provided the lead voice of Judy in Facebook Watch&#x27;s adult animated web series &quot;Human Kind Of&quot; (2018) and executive produced the teen drama web series &quot;Guidance&quot; (2015–2017) and Tubi&#x27;s true crime series &quot;Meet, Marry, Murder&quot; (2021).

==Early life==
Michelle Christine Trachtenberg was born on October 11, 1985, in New York City, to Lana, a bank manager, and Michael Trachtenberg, a fiber-optics manager. Her parents were Jewish immigrants; her father was from Germany, whereas her mother was from Russia. Her mother helped her learn some Russian for a role in 2013. Her grandparents reside in Israel. She had an older sister named Irene.

Trachtenberg was raised in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, where she attended junior high school at The Bay Academy for the Arts and Sciences. Her family later moved to Los Angeles, where she attended Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks. She said in a later interview and on social media that she was bullied in school. She never married nor had any children, and her dating life, if she had any, was unknown to the public.

==Career==
===1988–2005: Career beginnings and &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;===

Trachtenberg made her first TV appearance at age three in a commercial for Wisk detergent. She would eventually play featured roles in more than 100 commercials. She made her television debut in an episode of the crime drama &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, before gaining recognition on the Nickelodeon series &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot;. During the same period, she played Lily Montgomery on the soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;.

Trachtenberg&#x27;s film career began in 1996 with the title role in &quot;Harriet the Spy&quot;, for which she had to leave &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot; while its third season was running. She then starred in the short-lived television series &quot;Meego&quot;, which garnered her a Young Artist Award. She returned to film in 1999 for &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;. She also starred in the film &quot;Can&#x27;t Be Heaven&quot;. In 2000, she began playing Dawn Summers, the younger sister of the title character (played by Sarah Michelle Gellar) in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. She also hosted the Discovery Kids series &quot;Truth or Scare&quot; from 2001 to 2003, for which she was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award.
In 2004, after &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Truth or Scare&quot;, Trachtenberg appeared as Jenny in the teen comedy film &quot;EuroTrip&quot;. That same year, Trachtenberg played Wendy in Gregg Araki&#x27;s film adaptation of Scott Heim&#x27;s novel, &quot;Mysterious Skin&quot;. Wendy is the best friend of Neil (Joseph Gordon Levitt), a teenage hustler in small-town Kansas. The film debuted at the 2004 Venice Film Festival. She also had a recurring role in the HBO series &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, as Celeste, a spoiled pop star.

In March 2005, Trachtenberg starred in Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; comedy sports drama film &quot;Ice Princess&quot; as Casey Carlyle, a science whiz, who is torn between a future in academia and her newfound dream of being a competitive figure skater.

===2006–2010: &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; and other work===
In April 2006, Trachtenberg guest-starred in the episode of &quot;House&quot;, &quot;Safe&quot;. She revealed on the December 22, 2006, episode of &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; that &quot;House&quot; was her favorite show, and that she was friends with one of the producers and had asked to be a guest star.

In November 2006, Trachtenberg guest starred in season six of the crime drama &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;. In the episode &quot;Weeping Willow&quot;, she played the role of Willow, a kidnapped video blogger, likely based on lonelygirl15. Trachtenberg also appeared in the Fall Out Boy music video for &quot;This Ain&#x27;t a Scene, It&#x27;s an Arms Race&quot;, the Joaquin Phoenix-directed music video for &quot;Tired of Being Sorry&quot; by Ringside, and the video for the Trapt song &quot;Echo&quot;.
In 2006, Trachtenberg starred in &quot;Black Christmas&quot;, the remake of the 1974 slasher. In 2007, she was cast as the female lead in an ABC comedy pilot called &quot;The Hill&quot;, based on the newspaper of the same name in Washington, D.C.

Trachtenberg provided the voice of Tika Waylan for &quot;&quot;, a direct-to-video animated film based on the novel of the same name. She appeared on The CW hit show &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, as Georgina Sparks, who recently left rehab and brings back the dark past Serena van der Woodsen desperately wants to leave behind. She returned to the show for a multiple-episode story arc towards the end of season two. Trachtenberg appeared in the season three finale and in season four. She also appeared several times in season five, and in almost every episode of season six, the show&#x27;s final season. In 2009, Trachtenberg was a cast member on the NBC drama series &quot;Mercy&quot;, which lasted one season. She then returned to film, starring in the 2009 teen fantasy comedy &quot;17 Again&quot; and had a small role in the comedy &quot;Cop Out&quot; (2010).

===2011–2024: Later work and final projects===
On June 9, 2011, Trachtenberg guest starred on &quot;Love Bites&quot;, as Jodie, who, after being unceremoniously dumped, decides – with a vengeance – to accept her ex&#x27;s offer to &quot;be friends&quot;. She reprised the role on June 16, 2011, and in the series finale on July 21, 2011. In the same year, Trachtenberg was a guest star on &quot;Weeds&quot; during its seventh season, portraying Emma, a rival pot dealer who causes problems for Silas Botwin. In June 2012, Trachtenberg was cast in the film &quot;The Scribbler&quot;, produced by Gabriel Cowan.

In the &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; episode &quot;Zugzwang&quot;, Trachtenberg played Diane Turner, the criminal stalker of Spencer Reid&#x27;s girlfriend, Maeve Donovan. In March 2011, she was the featured cover girl in &quot;Maxim&quot;.

In late 2015, Trachtenberg starred in the online series &quot;Guidance&quot; as Anna, the high school guidance counselor. In 2016, she said she was a member of the Writers Guild of America and that she was working on several writing projects and continued to be inspired by her role in &quot;Harriet the Spy&quot;. According to filmmaker Casey Tebo, she had written a screenplay based on the book &quot;Toy Monster.&quot;

In 2022, Trachtenberg reprised her role as Georgina Sparks in the second season of the HBO revival of &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;. In 2023, she had a voice role in Apple TV&#x27;s animated series adaptation of &quot;Harriet the Spy&quot;.

== Death ==
In early 2024, Trachtenberg addressed concerns on social media regarding her health after some people commented on her noticeable weight loss and signs of jaundice. She reassured her followers that she was &quot;happy and healthy.&quot;

On February 26, 2025, Trachtenberg was found unresponsive by her mother in her Manhattan apartment at 8 a.m. Emergency medical services were called to the scene and pronounced her dead at the age of 39. It was later revealed that Trachtenberg had undergone a liver transplant prior to her death. Authorities confirmed that her death was not being treated as suspicious. The cause of death remained undetermined after her family objected to an autopsy on religious grounds.

Following her death, numerous celebrities expressed their condolences and paid tribute to Trachtenberg, including her &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; co-stars. &quot;Harriet the Spy&quot; co-star Rosie O&#x27;Donnell said, &quot;I loved her very much. She struggled the last few years. I wish I could have helped.&quot; As a character actress who was never an A-list star, the response to her death was disproportionately strong, a phenomenon that &quot;Slate&quot; attributed to her young age at death, her personal life (and thus any reputation-damaging scandals) being largely out of the public spotlight, and the fact that her most famous roles were in cult films and as a supporting character in TV series that were iconic to her generation.

<text>Gerhard is the professional name of a Canadian artist known for the elaborately detailed background illustrations in the comics series &quot;Cerebus the Aardvark&quot;.

==Biography==
Gerhard was born on April 14, 1959, in Edmonton. His association with Dave Sim&#x27;s &quot;Cerebus&quot; began with issue #65 (August 1984), and continued through its conclusion in issue #300, in March, 2004. The series was written by Dave Sim, who also drew the foreground figures, and had worked on the self-published series largely solo for the first 64 issues. Gerhard jokingly described his job saying that he &quot;draws tables and chairs behind an aardvark&quot;. He is also fond of photography and sailing. Later issues of the comic book have covers based on his scenic photos.

Three years after finishing his work on &quot;Cerebus&quot;, Gerhard ended his professional and personal relationship with Dave Sim. Subsequently, Sim has been in the process of purchasing Gerhard&#x27;s share of Aardvark-Vanaheim.

Although most associated with &quot;Cerebus&quot;, Gerhard has produced works for other publications, although mostly with Sim. In September 1994, however, he worked with Stephen R. Bissette on the cover to Bissette&#x27;s &quot;Tyrant&quot; #1, and coloured Sim&#x27;s back cover for Oni Press&#x27; &quot;Free Speeches&quot; #1 (August 1998).

<doc id="256010" wikidata="Q917356" url="?curid=256010" title="Musk duck">
<text>The musk duck (Biziura lobata) is a highly aquatic, stiff-tailed duck native to southern Australia. It is the only living member of the genus &quot;Biziura&quot;. An extinct relative, the New Zealand musk duck or de Lautour&#x27;s duck (&quot;B. delautouri&quot;), once occurred on New Zealand, but is only known from prehistoric subfossil bones. It was about 8% longer than the living species, with a particularly large head.

This animal derives its common name from the peculiar musky odour it emanates during the breeding season. Musk ducks are moderately common through the Murray-Darling and Cooper Creek basins, and in the wetter, fertile areas in the south of the continent: the southwest corner of Western Australia, Victoria, and Tasmania.

==Description==

Adult males are long and have a distinctive large, leathery lobe underneath the bill; females are long and unadorned. Their drab dark grey-brown, slightly pin-striped plumage is inconspicuous and does not differ between the sexes. This species weighs an average of in males and in females, with the smallest females weighing only and the largest males weighing up to . On average, they are the second-heaviest diving duck in the world after the common eider, with male musk ducks actually being slightly heavier than male common eiders, but female eiders being rather larger than female musk ducks due to that species&#x27; lesser size sexual dimorphism. Musk ducks float very low in the water, almost like a cormorant, and the large, webbed feet are well back on the body. The ducklings are covered in dark brown down.

In its native range, the fanned tail is distinctive, allowing to distinguish this species from the freckled duck (&quot;Stictonetta naevosa&quot;) which has similar size, colouration, and habits. The blue-billed duck (&quot;Oxyura australis&quot;) has a similarly shaped tail, but the main colour of its males in breeding plumage is a much richer chestnut brown. Females and males in nonbreeding plumage are very similar, however, and if one is not intimately familiar with the slight differences in behaviour, they cannot be told apart from female musk ducks at a distance. Male musk ducks in the breeding season are usually unmistakable due to the large bill lobe.

==Systematics==
The relationships of this peculiar species are quite enigmatic. It is traditionally included with the stiff-tailed duck subfamily Oxyurinae, but appears to be only distantly related to the genus &quot;Oxyura&quot;, and its peculiar apomorphies make it difficult to place. Its relationship with the equally strange pink-eared ducks (&quot;Malacorhynchus&quot;) is unresolved, but seems to be quite close, and it seems to be part of an ancient Gondwanan radiation of Anatidae. As such, it is fairly closely related to the stiff-tailed ducks proper, but it seems not quite as closely related as formerly believed, with many similarities due to convergent evolution.

==Ecology and status==

This species prefers deep, still lakes and wetlands with areas of both open water and reed beds. They seldom emerge from the water and are awkward on dry land. They rarely fly: take off is made with difficulty, and landing is a clumsy, low-angled affair with no attempt to lower the feet. However, at need musk ducks fly swiftly and for long distances, with rapid, shallow wing beats.

In the water, musk ducks display an effortless agility, twisting and turning on the surface with both feet and tail. In general, musk ducks remain in the water all day long, alternately loafing and feeding energetically, though they sometimes emerge to sit on a log or on dry land for a while. They stay on the water at night, sleeping well out from land with the head tucked into the body or under a wing.

Musk ducks are very much at home below the surface, slipping under head-first with barely a ripple, and staying submerged for as long as a minute at a time, often resurfacing only for a few moments before diving again. They dive to escape predators or unwanted company, and to search for food, typically in fairly deep water. They can descend to at least 6 m (about 20 ft). The primary diet items are water beetles, yabbies, freshwater snails and shellfish, and the like, supplemented with a variety of aquatic plants and a few fish.

When not breeding, adults are generally solitary. Adult males hold and defend territories, excluding other males and quite often females, too. Younger birds – juveniles and unmated adults – form flocks on larger bodies of water at some times of year. It is not known at what age they reach sexual maturity in the wild, but it may take several years. They are a long-lived species and are still capable of breeding when 20 years old or more.

===Reproduction===
The musk duck breeding season varies with rainfall and water levels, but is typically between July and January, with the greatest number of clutches laid in September or October, the austral spring. Despite a number of more general studies, little is known about musk duck breeding. During breeding season, they give off the musky odour from which the species derives its common name. Also, in the season males advertise themselves loudly with a repetitive sequence of sounds: first, a &quot;ker-plonk&quot; splash made with the feet on the surface of the water; then two soft, sharp &quot;cuc cuc&quot; calls; then a loud whistle and a deep grunt. This sequence can be started at any time of day or night, with or without an associated visual display, and repeated every 4 or 5 seconds for as long as half an hour at a time. Although male musk ducks have a large leathery lobe below the bill and this swells during the breeding season, it is not connected to the vocal cavities and appears to be purely for visual purposes.

Mating is thought to be promiscuous, quite possibly on a lek system like that of the kākāpō (a very large, flightless parrot found only in New Zealand), but this remains uncertain. The male plays no part in building the nest or raising the young.

Females select a secluded location for nesting, usually in tall reeds well away from land and protected by deep water, or under the cover of overhanging shrubbery, but sometimes in a range of innovative places, such as on a stump, in a hollow log, or even under an upturned boat. The nest is a simple platform of trampled plant material with a slight cup, lined with fine plant matter and, after the eggs are laid, plenty of down. She seems to be unable to carry nest material and must rely on whatever is within reach. With the nest complete, she pulls reeds down from overhead to make a canopy, hiding it from view. When leaving the nest to feed, she slips quietly into the water and submerges, not surfacing until she is well away from it.

Clutch size is unknown: as many as 10 eggs have been counted in a nest, but it seems likely that this is the result of dump nesting: three or four eggs are considered more likely. In most cases, only one duckling survives, sometimes two. They are able to swim and dive within a few days, after which they probably leave the nest. Young stay close to the mother for several months at least, sometimes riding on her back to begin with. They can peck at food items on the surface and dive a little while still quite small, but the mother continues to provide the bulk of their food until they are almost full-grown.

===Conservation status===
Musk ducks are sometimes shot by hunters, but are little prized, not being considered good eating. Wholesale clearing and draining of wetlands has impacted on their numbers, as has the widespread rise in Australian water salinity levels, but the species is not presently considered to be in danger.

===1987 speech mimicry tape rediscovered===
In September 2021, reports circulated about a rediscovered tape that originally was recorded in 1987 of a musk duck named Ripper at Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve in the Australian Capital Territory, who appeared to be the first duck recorded to mimic human speech. Reportedly, the recording demonstrates the duck saying &quot;you bloody fool&quot;, possibly repeating a catchphrase from one of the caretakers of the reserve. Although other bird species are capable of mimicking human speech, no other duck species is reported to have that capability.

==Subspecies==
The musk duck has two recognized subspecies. &quot;Biziura lobata menziesi&quot;, commonly referred to as the eastern musk duck, has a range from South Australia extending to the southern reaches of Queensland, through most of New South Wales and Victoria, and finally reaching as far south as Tasmania. The other subspecies is &quot;Biziura lobata lobata&quot;, commonly referred to as the western musk duck. Its range is the south-west of Western Australia.

This is achieved as a diagonal series of horizontal platforms called steps which enable passage to the other level by stepping from one to another step in turn. Steps are very typically rectangular. Stairs may be straight, curved, or may consist of two or more straight pieces connected at angles.

Types of stairs include staircases (also called stairways) and escalators. Some alternatives to stairs are elevators (also called lifts), stairlifts, inclined moving walkways, ladders, and ramps. A stairwell is a vertical shaft or opening that contains a staircase. A flight (of stairs) is an inclined part of a staircase consisting of steps (and their lateral supports if supports are separate from steps).

==History==
&quot;This is an excerpt from Staircase.&quot;

The concept of stairs is believed to be 8000 years old, and are one of the oldest structures in architectural history. The oldest example of spiral stairs dates back to the 400s BC. Medieval architecture saw experimentation with many different shapes, and the Renaissance even more so with varied designs.

==Components and terms==

A &quot;stair&quot;, or a &quot;stairstep&quot;, is one step in a flight of stairs. A &quot;staircase&quot; or &quot;stairway&quot; is one or more flights of stairs leading from one floor to another, and includes landings, newel posts, handrails, balustrades, and additional parts.

In buildings, &quot;stairs&quot; is a term applied to a complete flight of steps between two floors. A &quot;stair flight&quot; is a run of stairs or steps between landings. A &quot;stairwell&quot; is a compartment extending vertically through a building in which stairs are placed. A &quot;stair hall&quot; is the stairs, landings, hallways, or other portions of the public hall through which it is necessary to pass when going from the entrance floor to the other floors of a building. &quot;Box stairs&quot; are stairs built between walls, usually with no support except the wall strings.

Stairs may be in a &quot;straight run&quot;, leading from one floor to another without a turn or change in direction. Stairs may change direction, commonly by two straight flights connected at a 90° angle landing. Stairs may also return onto themselves with 180° angle landings at each end of straight flights forming a vertical stairway commonly used in multistory and highrise buildings. Many variations of geometrical stairs may be formed of circular, elliptical and irregular constructions.

Ascending a set of stairs to a higher floor is often referred to as going &quot;upstairs&quot;, the opposite being &quot;downstairs&quot;. The same words can also be used to mean the upper or lower floors of a building, respectively.

===Steps===

Each step is composed of a tread and a riser. Some treads may include a nosing.
* Tread: The part of the stairway that is stepped on. It is constructed to the same specifications (thickness) as any other flooring. The tread &quot;depth&quot; is measured from the back of one tread to the back of the next. The &quot;width&quot; is measured from one side to the other.
* Riser: The near-vertical element in a set of stairs, forming the space between one step and the next. It is sometimes slightly inclined from the vertical so that its top is closer than its base to the person climbing the stairs. If a physical riser is not present, the design is described as &quot;open riser&quot;. This is often the case in unfinished basements.
* Nosing: An edge part of the tread that protrudes over the riser beneath. If it is present, this means that, measured horizontally, the total &quot;run&quot; length of the stairs is not simply the sum of the tread lengths, as the treads overlap each other. Some building codes require stair nosings in specific cases where the tread depth is below a minimum value. They provide additional length to the tread without changing the pitch of the stairs.
* Starting or feature tread: Where stairs are open on one or both sides, the first step above the lower floor or landing may be wider than the other steps and rounded. When the starting step is rounded, the balusters typically are arranged in a true spiral around the circumference of the rounded portion, and the handrail has a flat spiral called a &quot;volute&quot; that connects the tops of the balusters. Besides the cosmetic appeal, starting steps allow the balusters to form a wider, more stable base for the end of the handrail. Handrails that simply end at a post at the foot of the stairs can be less sturdy, even with a thick post. A double-ended feature tread can be used when both sides of the stairs are open. There are a number of different styles and uses of feature tread.
* Stringer board, stringer, or sometimes just string: The structural member that supports the treads and risers in standard staircases. There are typically three stringers, one on either side and one in the center, with more added as necessary for wider spans. Side stringers are sometimes dadoed to receive risers and treads for increased support. Stringers on open-sided stairs are called &quot;cut stringers&quot;.
* Tread rise: The distance from the top of one tread to the top of the next tread.
* Total rise: The distance the flight of stairs raises vertically between two finished floor levels.
* Winders: Winders are steps that are narrower on one side than the other. They are used to change the direction of the stairs without landings. A series of winders form a circular or helical stairway. When three steps are used to turn a 90° corner, the middle step is called a &quot;kite winder&quot; as a kite-shaped quadrilateral.
* Trim: Various moldings are used to decorate and in some instances support stairway elements. Scotia or quarter-round are typically placed beneath the nosing to support its overhang.
* Curtail step: A decorative step at the bottom of a staircase that usually houses the volute and volute newel turning for a continuous handrail. The curtail tread will follow the flow of the volute.

===Handrails===
The balustrade is the system of railings and balusters that prevents people from falling over the edge.
* Banister, railing, or handrail: The angled member for handholding, as distinguished from the vertical balusters which hold it up for stairs that are open on one side. Railings are often present on both sides of stairs, but can sometimes be only on one side or absent altogether. On wide staircases, there can be one or more railings between the two sides. The term &quot;banister&quot; is sometimes used to mean just the handrail, sometimes the handrail and the balusters, or sometimes just the balusters.
* Volute: A handrail end element for the bullnose step that curves inward like a spiral. A volute is said to be right or left-handed depending on which side of the stairs the handrail is as one faces up the stairs.
* Turnout: Instead of a complete spiral volute, a turnout deviates from the normal handrail center line away from the flight to give a wider opening as one enters the staircase, The turnout is usually set over a newel post to give added stability to the handrail.
* Gooseneck: The vertical handrail that joins a sloped handrail to a higher handrail on the balcony or landing is a gooseneck.
* Rosette: Where the handrail ends in the wall and a half-newel is not used, it may be trimmed by a rosette.
* Easings: Wall handrails are mounted directly onto the wall with &quot;wall brackets&quot;. At the bottom of the stairs, such railings flare to a horizontal railing and this horizontal portion is called a &quot;starting easing&quot;. At the top of the stairs, the horizontal portion of the railing is called an &quot;over easing&quot;.
* Core rail: Wood handrails often have a metal core to provide extra strength and stiffness, especially when the rail has to curve against the grain of the wood. The archaic term for the metal core is &quot;core rail&quot;.
* Baluster: A term for the vertical posts that hold up the handrail. Sometimes simply called &quot;guards&quot; or &quot;spindles&quot;. Treads often require two balusters. The second baluster is closer to the riser and is taller than the first. The extra height in the second baluster is typically in the middle between decorative elements on the baluster. That way the bottom decorative elements are aligned with the tread and the top elements are aligned with the railing angle.

* Newel: A large baluster or post used to anchor the handrail. Since it is a structural element, it extends below the floor and subfloor to the bottom of the floor joists and is bolted right to the floor joist. A &quot;half-newel&quot; may be used where a railing ends in the wall. Visually, it looks like half the newel is embedded in the wall. For open landings, a newel may extend below the landing for a decorative &quot;newel drop&quot;.
* Finial: A decorative cap to the top of a newel post, particularly at the end of the balustrade.
*Baserail, or shoerail: For systems where the baluster does not start at the treads, they go to a baserail. This allows for identical balusters, avoiding the second baluster problem.
* Fillet: A decorative filler piece on the floor between balusters on a balcony railing.

Handrails may be &quot;continuous&quot; (sometimes called &quot;over-the-post&quot;) or &quot;post-to-post&quot; (or more accurately &quot;newel-to-newel&quot;). For continuous handrails on long balconies, there may be multiple newels and &quot;tandem caps&quot; to cover the newels. At corners, there are &quot;quarter-turn caps&quot;. For post-to-post systems, the newels project above the handrails.

Another, more classical, form of handrailing that is still in use is the tangent method. A variant of the cylindric method of layout, it allows for continuous climbing and twisting rails and easings. It was defined from principles set down by architect Peter Nicholson in the 18th century.

=== Other terms ===

* Flight: Any uninterrupted series of steps between floors or levels.
* Landing, or platform: A landing is the area of a floor near the top or bottom step of a stair. An intermediate landing is a small platform that is built as part of stairs between main floor levels and is typically used to allow the stairs to change directions, or to allow the user a rest. A half landing, or half-pace, is where a 180° change in direction is made, and a quarter landing is where a 90° change in direction is made (on an intermediate landing). As intermediate landings consume floor space, they can be expensive to build. However, changing the direction of the stairs allows stairs to fit where they would not otherwise, or provides privacy to the upper level as visitors downstairs cannot simply look up the stairs to the upper level due to the change in direction. The word &#x27;landing&#x27; is also commonly used for a general corridor in any of the floors above the ground floor of a building, even if that corridor is located well away from a staircase.
* Apron: This is a wooden fascia board used to cover up trimmers and joists exposed by stairwell openings. The apron may be moulded or plain, and is intended to give the staircase a cleaner look by cloaking the side view.
* Balcony: For stairs with an open concept upper floor or landing, the upper floor is functionally a balcony. For a straight flight of stairs, the balcony may be long enough to require multiple newels to support the length of railing.

* Floating stairs: A flight of stairs is said to be &quot;floating&quot; if there is nothing underneath. The risers are typically missing as well to emphasize the open effect, and create a functional feature suspended in midair. There may be only one stringer or the stringers otherwise minimized. Where building codes allow, there may not even be handrails.
* Mobile safety steps: Can be used as temporary, safe replacements for many types of stairs
* Runner: Carpeting that runs down the middle of the stairs. Runners may be directly stapled or nailed to the stairs, or may be secured by a specialized bar, known as a stair rod, that holds the carpet in place where the tread meets the riser.
* Spandrel: If there is not another flight of stairs immediately underneath, the triangular space underneath the stairs is called a &quot;spandrel&quot;. It is frequently used as a closet.
* Stairwell: The spatial opening, usually a vertical shaft, containing an indoor stairway; by extension, it is often used to include the stairs it contains.
*Staircase tower: A tower attached to, or incorporated into, a building that contains stairs linking the various floors.

===Dimensions===
The dimensions of a stair, in particular the rise height and going of the steps, should remain the same along the stairs.

The following stair dimensions are important:
* The &quot;rise height&quot; or &quot;rise&quot; of each step is measured from the top of one tread to the next. It is not the physical height of the riser; the latter excludes the thickness of the tread. A person using the stairs would move this distance vertically for each step taken.
* The &quot;tread depth&quot; of a step is measured from the edge of the nosing to the vertical riser; if the steps have no nosing, it is the same as the going; otherwise it is the going plus the extent of one nosing.
* The &quot;going&quot; of a step is measured from the edge of the nosing to the edge of nosing in plan view. A person using the stairs would move this distance forward with each step they take.
* To avoid confusion, the &quot;number of steps&quot; in a set of stairs is always the number of risers, not the number of treads.
* The &quot;total run&quot; or &quot;total going&quot; of the stairs is the horizontal distance from the first riser to the last riser. It is often not simply the sum of the individual tread lengths due to the nosing overlapping between treads. If there are &quot;N&quot; steps, the total run equals &quot;N&quot;-1 times the going: the tread of the first step is part of a landing.
* The &quot;total rise&quot; of the stairs is the height between floors (or landings) that the flight of stairs is spanning. If there are &quot;N&quot; steps, the total rise equals &quot;N&quot; times the rise of each step.
* The &quot;slope&quot; or &quot;pitch&quot; of the stairs is the ratio between the rise and the going (not the tread depth, due to the nosing). It is sometimes called the &quot;rake&quot; of the stairs. The &quot;pitch line&quot; is the imaginary line along the tip of the nosing of the treads. In the UK, stair pitch is the angle the pitch line makes with the horizontal, measured in degrees. The value of the slope, as a ratio, is then the tangent of the pitch angle.
* &quot;Headroom&quot; is the height above the nosing of a tread to the ceiling above it.
* &quot;Walkline&quot; – for curved stairs, the inner radius of the curve may result in very narrow treads. The &quot;walkline&quot; is the imaginary line some distance away from the inner edge on which people are expected to walk. The building code will specify the distance. Building codes will then specify the minimum tread size at the walkline.

==Forms==

Stairs can take a large number of forms, combining straight runs, winders, and landings.

The simplest form is the straight flight of stairs, with neither winders nor landings. These types of stairs were commonly used in traditional homes, as they are relatively easy to build and only need to be connected at the top and bottom. However, many modern architects may not choose straight flights of stairs because:
* the upstairs is directly visible from the bottom of a straight flight of stairs
* it is potentially more dangerous in that a fall is not interrupted until the bottom of the stairs
* a straight flight requires enough straight length for the entire run of the stairs

Another form of a straight staircase is the &quot;space saver staircase&quot;, also known as &quot;paddle stairs&quot; or &quot;alternating tread staircases&quot;. These designs can be used for a steeper rise, but they can only be used in certain circumstances, and must comply with regulations.

However, a basic straight flight of stairs is easier to design and construct than one with landings or winders. The rhythm of stepping is not interrupted in a straight run, which may offset an increased fall risk by helping to prevent a misstep in the first place. However, many long straight runs of stairs will require landings or winders to comply with safety standards in building regulations.

Straight stairs can have a mid-landing incorporated, but it is probably more common to see stairs that use a landing or winder to produce a bend in the stairs. A straight flight with a mid-landing will require a lot of straight length, and may be more commonly found in large commercial buildings. L-shaped stairways have one landing and usually a change in direction by 90°. U-shaped stairs may employ a single wider landing for a change in direction of 180°, or two landings for two changes in direction of 90° each. A Z-shaped staircase incorporates two opposite 90° turns, creating a shape similar to that of the letter &quot;Z&quot; if seen from above. The use of landings and a possible change of direction have the following effects:
* The upstairs is not directly visible from the bottom of the stairs, which can provide more privacy for the upper floor
* A fall can be halted at the landing point, reducing the total distance and potential injury
* Though the landings consume more total floor space, there is no requirement for a single lengthy run, allowing more flexible floorplan designs
* For larger stairs, particularly in exterior applications, a landing can provide a place for pedestrians to rest their legs

Other forms include stairs with winders that curve or bend at an acute angle, three flights of stairs that join at a landing to form a T-shape, and stairs with balconies and complex designs.

A &quot;mono string&quot; staircase is a term used for a staircase with treads arranged along a single steel beam. A &quot;double string&quot; staircase has two steel beams, one on either side, and treads spanning between.

==Helical (&quot;spiral&quot;) stairs==



===Terminology===

The term &quot;helical stair&quot; has many synonyms:
The term &quot;spiral&quot; has a more narrow definition in a mathematical context, as a curve which lies in a single plane and moves towards or away from a central point, with a continuously changing radius. The mathematical term for the 3-dimensional curve traced where the locus progresses at a fixed radius from a fixed line while moving in a circular motion around it is a &quot;helix&quot;. Since the very purpose of a stairway is to change elevation, it is inherently a 3-dimensional path.

Loose everyday usage conflates the terms &quot;helical&quot; and &quot;spiral&quot;, but the vast majority of circular stairs are actually helical. True spiral staircases would be nonfunctional flat structures, although functional hybrid helical spiral staircases can be constructed. This article attempts to preferentially use the terms &quot;helix&quot; and &quot;helical&quot; to describe circular stairways more clearly and precisely, while reserving the term &quot;spiral&quot; for a curve restricted to a flat plane.

Helical stairs, sometimes referred to in architectural descriptions as &quot;&quot;, wind around a newel (also called the &quot;central pole&quot;). The presence or absence of a central pole or newel does not affect the overall terminology applied to the design of the structure. In Scottish architecture, helical stairs are commonly known as a &quot;&quot;.

Helical stairs typically have a handrail along the outer periphery only, and on the inner side may have just a central pole. A &quot;squared helical&quot; stair fills a square stairwell and expands the steps and railing to a square, resulting in unequal steps (wider and longer where they extend into a corner of the square). A &quot;pure helix&quot; fills a circular stairwell, and has multiple steps and handrail elements which are identical and positioned screw-symmetrically.

Helical stairs have a handedness or chirality, analogous to the handedness of screw threads, either right-handed or left-handed helical shapes. Ascending a right-handed helix rises counter-clockwise, while ascending a left-handed helix rises clockwise (both as viewed from above).

===Geometry===

A fundamental advantage of helical stairs is that they can be very compact, fitting into very narrow spaces and occupying a small footprint. For this reason, they can often be found in ships and submarines, industrial installations, small loft apartments, and other locations where floorspace is scarce. However, this compactness can come at the expense of requiring great craftsmanship and care to produce a safe and effective structure. By contrast, grand helical stairs occupying wide sweeps of space can also be built, to showcase luxurious funding and elegant taste. Architects have used the twisting curvilinear shape as an embellishment, either within or outside of their buildings.

Helical stairs have the disadvantage of being very steep if they are tight (small radius) or are otherwise not supported by a center column. The cylindrical spaces they occupy can have a narrow or wide diameter:
* The wider the helix, the more steps can be accommodated per revolution around the central axis. Therefore, if the helix is large in diameter, due to having a central support column that is strong (and large in diameter) with a special handrail that helps to distribute the load, each step may be longer and therefore the rise between each step may be smaller (equal to that of regular steps). Otherwise, the circumference of the circle at the walk line will be so small that it will be impossible to maintain a normal tread depth and a normal rise height without compromising headroom before reaching the upper floor.
*A small-diameter helix can still have wider treads near the central axis, by making the treads &quot;dance&quot;. The narrow end of each tapering wedge-shaped tread is widened, and installed to overlap the adjacent treads above and below.
* To maintain headroom, some helical stairs with a very short diameter must also have a very high rise for each step. These are typically cases where the stairwell must be a small diameter to fit a narrow space, or must not have any center support by design, or may not have any perimeter support. A tight helical stair with a central pole is very space efficient in the use of floor footprint. However, this type of stairway must be used carefully, to avoid an injurious fall.

&quot;Open well&quot; helical or circular stairs designed by architects often do not have a central pole, but there usually is a handrail at both sides of the treads. These designs have the advantage of a more uniform tread depth when compared to a narrow helical staircase. Such stairs may also be built around an elliptical or oval footprint, or even a triangular or pentagonal core. Lacking a central pole, an open well staircase is supported at its outer periphery, or in some cases may be a completely self-supporting and free-standing structure.

An example of perimeter support is the Vatican stairwell or the Gothic stairwell. The latter stairwell is tight because of its location where the diameter must be small. Many helices, however, have sufficient width for normal-size treads () by being supported by any combination of a center pole, perimeter supports attaching to or beneath the treads, and a helical handrail. In this manner, the treads may be wide enough to accommodate low rises. In self-supporting stairs, the helix needs to be steep to allow the weight to distribute safely down the structure in the most vertical manner possible. Helical steps with center columns or perimeter support do not have this limitation. Building codes may limit the use of helical stairs to small areas or secondary usage, if their treads are not sufficiently wide or have risers taller than .

Double helix staircases are possible, with two independent helical stairs in the same vertical space, allowing one person to ascend and another to descend without ever meeting, if they choose different helices. For examples, the Pozzo di San Patrizio allows one-way traffic so that laden and unladen mules can ascend and descend without obstruction, while Château de Chambord, Château de Blois, and the Crédit Lyonnais headquarters ensure separation for social purposes.

Emergency exit stairways, though built with landings and straight runs of stairs, are often functionally double helices, with two separate stairs intertwined and occupying the same floor footprint. This is often in compliance with legal safety requirements to have two independent fire escape paths.

Helical stairs can be characterized by the number of turns that are made. A &quot;quarter-turn&quot; stair deposits the person facing 90° from the starting orientation. Likewise, there are half-turn, three-quarters-turn and full-turn stairs. A continuous helix may make many turns depending on the height. Very tall multi-turn helical staircases are usually found in old stone towers within fortifications, churches, and in lighthouses. Winders may be used in combination with straight stairs to turn the direction of the stairs. This allows for a large number of permutations in designs.

===Historic uses===

The earliest known helical staircases appear in Temple A in the Greek colony Selinunte, Sicily, to both sides of the cella. The temple was constructed around 480–470 BCE.

When used in Roman architecture, helical stairs were generally restricted to elite luxury structures. They were then adopted into Christian ecclesiastic architecture. During the Renaissance and Baroque periods, increasingly spectacular helical stairways were devised, first deleting walled enclosures, and then deleting a central post to leave an open well. Modern designs have trended towards minimalism, culminating in helical stairs made largely of transparent glass, or consisting only of stair treads with minimal visible support.

There is a common misconception that helical staircases in castles rose in a clockwise direction, to hinder right-handed attackers. While clockwise helical staircases are more common in castles than anti-clockwise, they were even more common in medieval structures without a military role, such as religious buildings. Studies of helical stairs in castles have concluded that &quot;the role and position of spirals in castles ... had a much stronger domestic and status role than a military function&quot; and that &quot;there are sufficient examples of anticlockwise stairs in Britain and France in [the 11th and 12th centuries] to indicate that the choice must have depended both on physical convenience and architectural practicalities and there was no military ideology that demanded clockwise staircases in the cause of fighting efficiency or advantage&quot;.

Developments in manufacturing and design have also led to the introduction of kit form helical stairs. Modular, standardized steps and handrails can be bolted together to form a complete unit. These stairs can be made out of steel, timber, concrete, or a combination of materials.

==Alternating tread stairs==
Where there is insufficient space for the full run length of normal stairs, &quot;alternating tread stairs&quot; may be used (other names are &quot;paddle stairs&quot;, &quot;zig-zag stairs&quot;, or &quot;double-riser stairs&quot;). Alternating tread stairs can be designed to allow for a safe forward-facing descent of very steep stairs (however, designs with recessed treads or footholds do not have this feature). The treads are designed such that they alternate between treads for each foot: one step is wide on the left side; the next step is wide on the right side. There is insufficient space on the narrow portion of the step for the other foot to stand, hence the person must always use the correct foot on the correct step. The slope of alternating tread stairs can be as high as 65° as opposed to standard stairs, which are almost always less than 45°.

An advantage of alternating tread stairs is that people can descend while facing forward, in the direction of travel. The only other alternative in such short spaces would be a ladder, which requires a backward-facing descent. Alternating tread stairs may not be safe for small children, the elderly, or the physically challenged. Building codes typically classify them as ladders, and will only allow them where ladders are allowed, usually basement or attic utility or storage areas infrequently accessed.

The block model in the image illustrates the space efficiency gained by an alternating tread stair. The alternating stairs (3) requires one unit of space per step: the same as the half-width stairs (2), and half as much as the full-width stairs (1). Thus, the horizontal distance between steps is in this case reduced by a factor of two, reducing the size of each step. The horizontal distance between steps is reduced by a factor less than two if for construction reasons there are narrow &quot;unused&quot; step extensions.

These stairs often (including this example) illustrate the mathematical principle of glide plane symmetry: the mirror image with respect to the vertical center plane corresponds to a shift by one step.

Alternating tread stairs are sometimes referred to as &quot;witches stairs&quot;, in the supposed belief that they were created during an earlier era as an attempt to repel witches who were thought to be unable to climb such stairs. Such a fanciful origin of the term has since been disproved, with experts finding no mention in any historical literature of stairs that were believed to prevent access by witches.

Alternating tread stairs have been in use since at least 1888. Today, the design is used in some loft apartments to access bedrooms or storage spaces.

==Emergency exit stairs==

Local building codes often dictate the number of emergency exits required for a building of a given size, including specifying a minimum number of stairwells. For any building bigger than a private house, modern codes invariably specify at least two sets of stairs, completely isolated from each other so that if one becomes impassable due to smoke or flames, the other remains usable.

The traditional way to satisfy this requirement was to construct two separate stairwell stacks, each occupying its own footprint within each floorplate. Each stairwell is internally configured into an arrangement often called a &quot;U-return&quot; or &quot;return&quot; design. The two stairwells may be constructed next to each other, separated by a fireproof partition, or optionally the two stairwells may be located at some distance from each other within the floorplan. These traditional arrangements have the advantage of being easily understood by building occupants and occasional visitors.

Some architects save floor footprint space while still meeting the exit requirement, by housing two stairwells in a &quot;double helix&quot; or &quot;scissors stairs&quot; configuration whereby two stairwells occupy the same floor footprint, but are intertwined while being separated by fireproof partitions along their entire run. However, this design deposits anybody descending the stack into alternating locations on each successive floor, and this can be very disorienting. Some building codes recommend using a color-coded stripe and signage to distinguish otherwise identical-looking stairwells from each other, and to make following a quick exit path easier.

==Ergonomics and building code requirements==

Ergonomically and for safety reasons, stairs must have certain dimensions so that people can comfortably use them. Building codes typically specify certain clearances so that the stairs are not too steep or narrow.

Nicolas-François Blondel in the last volume of his &quot;Cours d&#x27;architecture&quot; (1675–1683) was the first known person to establish the ergonomic relationship of tread and riser dimensions. He specified that 2 × riser + tread = step length.

It is estimated that a noticeable misstep occurs once in 7,398 uses and a minor accident on a flight of stairs occurs once in 63,000 uses. Stairs can be a hazardous obstacle for some, so some people choose to live in residences without stairs so that they are protected from injury.

Stairs are not suitable for wheelchairs and other vehicles. A stairlift is a mechanical device for lifting wheelchairs up and down stairs. For sufficiently wide stairs, a rail is mounted to the treads of the stairs, or attached to the wall. A chair is attached to the rail and the person on the chair is lifted as the chair moves along the rail.

===UK requirements===

(overview of Approved document K – Stairs, Ladders and Ramps)

The 2013 edition &quot;approved document K&quot; categorises stairs as &quot;private&quot;, &quot;utility&quot; and &quot;general access&quot;

When considering stairs for private dwellings, all the specified measurements are in millimetres.

Building regulations are required for stairs used where the difference of level is greater than 600

Steepness of stairs – rise and going

Any rise between 150 and 220 used with any going between 220 and 300

Maximum rise 220 and minimum going 220 remembering that the maximum pitch of private stairs is 42°. The normal relationship between dimensions of the rise and going is that twice the rise plus the going (2R + G) should be between 550 and 700

Construction of steps

Steps should have level treads, they may have open risers but if so treads should overlap at least 16mm. Domestic private stairs are likely to be used by children under 5 years old so the handrail ballister spacing should be constructed so that a 100mm diameter sphere cannot pass through the opening in the risers in order to prevent children from sticking their heads through them and potentially getting stuck.

Headroom

A headroom of 2000mm is adequate. Special considerations can be made for loft conversions.

Width of flights

No recommendations are given for stair widths.

Length of flights

The approved document refers to 16 risers (steps) for utility stairs and 12 for general access. There is no requirement for private stairs. In practice there will be fewer than 16 steps as 16 x 220 gives over 3500 total rise (storey height) which is way above that in a domestic situation.

Landings

Level, unobstructed landings should be provided at the top and bottom of every flight. The width and length being at least that of the width of the stairs and can include part of the floor. A door may swing across the landing at the bottom of the flight but must leave a clear space of at least 400 across the whole landing

Tapered steps

There are special rules for stairs with tapered steps as shown in the image Example of Winder Stairs above

Alternate tread stairs can be provide in space saving situations

Guarding

Flights and landings must be guarded at the sides where the drop is more than 600mm. As domestic private stairs are likely to be used by children under 5 the guarding must be constructed so that a 100mm diameter sphere cannot pass through any opening or constructed so that children will not be able to climb the guarding. The height for internal private stairs should be at least and be able to withstand a horizontal force of 0.36|kN/m|.

===US requirements===
American building codes, while varying from State to State and County to County, generally specify the following parameters:
* Minimum tread length, typically excluding the nosing for private residences. Some building codes also specify a minimum riser height, often .
* Riser-Tread formula: Sometimes the stair parameters will be something like riser plus tread equals ; another formula is 2 times riser + tread equals , the length of a stride. Thus a rise and a tread exactly meets this code. If only a rise is used then a tread is required. This is based on the principle that a low rise is more like walking up a gentle incline and so the natural swing of the leg will be longer.
* Low rise stairs are very expensive in terms of the space consumed. Such low rise stairs were built into the Winchester Mystery House to accommodate the infirmities of the owner, Sarah Winchester, before the invention of the elevator. These stairways, called &quot;Easy Risers&quot; consist of five flights wrapped into a multi-turn arrangement with a total width equal to more than four times the individual flight width and a depth roughly equal to one flight&#x27;s run plus this width. The flights have varying numbers of steps.
* Slope: A value for the rise-to-tread ratio of 17/29 ˜ 0.59 is considered optimal; this corresponds to a pitch angle of about 30°.
* Variance on riser height and tread depth between steps on the same flight should be very low. Building codes require variances no larger than between depth of adjacent treads or the height of adjacent risers; within a flight, the tolerance between the largest and smallest riser or between the largest and smallest tread can not exceed . The reason is that on a continuous flight of stairs, people get used to a regular step and may trip if there is a step that is different, especially at night. The general rule is that all steps on the same flight must be identical. Hence, stairs are typically custom made to fit the particular floor to floor height and horizontal space available. Special care must be taken on the first and last risers. Stairs must be supported directly by the subfloor. If thick flooring (e.g. thick hardwood planks) are added on top of the subfloor, it will cover part of the first riser, reducing the effective height of the first step. Likewise at the top step, if the top riser simply reaches the subfloor and thick flooring is added, the last rise at the top may be higher than the last riser. The first and last riser heights of the rough stairs are modified to adjust for the addition of the finished floor.
* Maximum nosing protrusion, typically to prevent people from tripping on the nosing.
* Height of the handrail. This is typically between , measured to the nose of the tread. The minimum height of the handrail for landings may be different and is typically .
* Handrail diameter. The size has to be comfortable for grasping and is typically between .
* Maximum space between the balusters of the handrail. This is typically .
* Openings (if they exist) between the bottom rail and treads are typically no bigger than .
* Headroom: At least .
* Maximum vertical height between floors or landings. This allows people to rest and limits the height of a fall.
* Mandate handrails if there is more than a certain number of steps (typically 2 risers).
* Minimum width of the stairway, with and without handrails.
* Not allow doors to swing over steps; the arc of doors must be completely on the landing/floor.
* A stairwell may be designated as an area of refuge as well as a fire escape route, due to its fire-resistance rated design and fresh air supply.
* The American Disabilities Act and other accessibility standards by state, such as Architectural Barriers Texas Accessibility Standards (TAS), do not allow open risers on accessible or egress stairs.

==Stairs in art and architecture==
Religious shrines and memorial structures are often approached via stairs, sometimes numbering hundreds or thousands of steps. Many Neoclassical buildings feature prominent wide stairs ascending to an elevated platform or plinth where the main entrance is located. In recent years, increasing concerns about accessibility have encouraged architects to retrofit discreet lower-level public entrances or elevators to ease wheelchair access.

Large open-well helical stairs have been used as a central feature in public buildings from the Renaissance until modern times. A 21st-century version is the helical glass-enclosed, glass-treaded stairways at the center of several flagship Apple Stores.

&quot;Vessel&quot; is an artistic structure and visitor attraction which was built as part of the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project in Manhattan, New York City. Built to plans by the British designer Thomas Heatherwick, the elaborate honeycomb-like structure rises 16 stories and consists of 154 flights of stairs, 2,500 steps, and 80 landings for visitors to explore.

Stairs may also be a fanciful physical construct such as the &quot;stairs that go nowhere&quot; located at the Winchester Mystery House. The Penrose stairs, devised by Lionel and Roger Penrose, are a famous impossible object. The image distorts perspective in such a manner that the stairs appear to be never-ending, a physical impossibility. The image was adopted by M. C. Escher in his iconic lithograph &quot;Ascending and Descending&quot;.

==Notable sets of stairs==
* The longest stairway is listed by Guinness Book of Records as the service stairway for the &quot;Niesenbahn&quot; funicular railway near Spiez, Switzerland, with 11,674 steps and a height of . The stairs are usually employee-only, but there is a public run called &quot;Niesenlauf&quot; once a year.
* Mount Girnar, one of the holiest of sacred places for Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist followers, and also for some Muslims, is located in Junagadh district in the Indian state of Gujarat in Saurashtrian peninsula. At a height of 1100 metres, with five summits, each adorned with several sacred places, it is accessed on foot by soaring close to 10,000 steps along a rugged terrain and deciduous forest that is also the last home for Asiatic lions. It is the longest completely stone-made stairway in the world.
* Alipiri, India, is one of two ways to reach the Sri Venkateswara Swami Vaari Temple, Tirumala from Tirupati on foot, and it was until recently the only one in modern times. The temple is the richest Hindu temple in the world in terms of donations received and wealth and is visited by about 50,000 to 100,000 pilgrims per day (30 to 40 million people annually on average), while on special occasions and festivals like the annual Brahmotsavam, the number of pilgrims shoots up to 500,000, making it the most-visited holy place in the world. Srivari Mettu, about 20 km away, is the original one that was renovated and brought back to use in 2008. Alipiri is the longer route with more than 3550 steps, Srivari Mettu is shorter with 2388 steps.
* A flight of 7,200 steps (including inner temple Steps), with 6,293 Official Mountain Walkway Steps, leads up the East Peak of Mount Tai in China.
* The Haiku Stairs, on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, are approximately 4,000 steps which climb nearly . Originally used to access long wire radio antennas which were strung high above the Haiku Valley, between Honolulu and Kaneohe, they are closed to hikers.
* The Flørli stairs, in Lysefjorden, Norway, have 4,444 wooden steps that climb from sea level to . It is a maintenance stairway for the water pipeline to the old Flørli hydro plant. The hydro plant is now closed down, and the stairs are open to the public. The stairway is claimed to be the longest wooden stairway in the world.
* The longest stone stairs in Japan are the 3,333-step stairs of the Shakain temple in Yatsushiro, Kumamoto. The second ones, Mount Haguro stone stairs, have 2,446 steps in Tsuruoka, Yamagata.
* The CN Tower&#x27;s staircase reaches the main deck level after 1,776 steps and the Sky Pod above after 2,579 steps; it is the tallest metal staircase on Earth.
* The Gemonian stairs were infamous as a place of execution during the early Roman Empire, especially during the period postdating Tiberius.
* The World Trade Center &quot;Survivors&#x27; Staircase&quot; is the last visible structure above ground level at the World Trade Center site. It was originally two outdoor flights of granite-clad stairs and an escalator that connected Vesey Street to the World Trade Center&#x27;s Austin J. Tobin Plaza. During the September 11, 2001, attacks, the stairs served as an escape route for hundreds of evacuees from 5 World Trade Center, a 9-floor building adjacent to the 110-story towers. Stairwell A was the lone stairway left intact after the second plane hit the South Tower of the World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks. It was believed to have remained intact until the South Tower collapsed at 9:59 am. 14 people were able to escape the floors located at the impact zone (including one man who saw the plane coming at him), and 4 people from the floors above the impact zone. Numerous 911 operators who received calls from individuals inside the South Tower were not well informed of the situation as it rapidly unfolded in the South Tower. Many operators told callers not to descend the tower on their own, even though it is now believed that Stairwell A was most likely passable at and above the point of impact.
* In London, England, a notable staircase is that to the Monument to the Great Fire of London, more commonly known simply as &quot;the Monument&quot;. This is a column in the City of London, near the northern end of London Bridge, which commemorates the Great Fire of London. The top of the Monument is reached by a narrow winding staircase of 311 steps. Constructed between 1671 and 1677, it is the tallest isolated stone column in the world.
* The Spanish Steps in Rome are a monument of late Italian Baroque architecture connecting the Piazza di Spagna with the Trinità dei Monti up the side of the Pincian Hill. Designed by Francesco De Sanctis and constructed 1723–1725, the 135 steps form a wide vista looking down toward the Tiber. The steps are adorned with garden terraces blooming with azaleas and have been widely celebrated in cultural work.
* The Loretto Chapel in Santa Fe, New Mexico, is well known for its helix-shaped staircase, which has been nicknamed &quot;Miraculous Stair&quot;. It has been the subject of legend and rumor, and the circumstances surrounding its construction and its builder are considered miraculous by the Sisters of Loretto and many visitors.
* The El Toro 20, a twenty-step set of stairs in Lake Forest, California, was well known among skateboarders, BMXers, and inline skaters as a popular and challenging skate spot. The first skateboarder to do an ollie down it was Don Nguyen. The staircase was demolished in 2019.
* The Grand Staircase of the Titanic was one of the most recognizable features of the British transatlantic ocean liner that sank on her maiden voyage in 1912 after a collision with an iceberg.
* Decorated stair risers were used extensively in the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, to form the pedestal to small devotional stupas. They were usually adorned with friezes, fantastic animals and decorations. A flight of stairs with decorated stair risers from the Chakhil-i-Ghoundi Stupa has been almost fully restored and can now be seen at the Guimet Museum in Paris. Archaeological research by the Italian IsMEO at the Butkara Stupa suggests that small decorative stairs were adjoined to Buddhist stupas at the time of the Indo-Greek Kingdom, and that they were decorated with Buddhist scenes.

<text>Hepcats is a comic book series self-published in the 1990s by cartoonist Martin Wagner. It deals with the lives of four college students, rendered as anthropomorphic animals (humanoid bodies, but animal heads), and is inspired by Wagner&#x27;s own college experiences.

== Publication history ==
The series began as a comic strip in &quot;The Daily Texan&quot;, the student newspaper of the University of Texas at Austin, in 1987. Each installment was typically four panels (but with frequent variation), usually with a comedic gag at the end, but with ongoing storylines.

In 1989, inspired by cartoonists such as Dave Sim who were successfully self-publishing their comics, Wagner began publishing &quot;Hepcats&quot; as a black-and-white comic book series, under his own Double Diamond Press imprint. In this format, the series took on the highly detailed pen-and-ink artwork that would become one of its distinguishing features. Wagner immediately began experimenting with page layouts, including turning the pages sideways, using a double-page spread for each layout for Issue #2. Issue #3 began what was intended to be an 18-part graphic novel entitled &quot;Snowblind&quot;. Critics have frequently cited Sim&#x27;s &quot;Cerebus the Aardvark&quot; as an artistic influence on this material.

Though critically acclaimed, with a cult following, the series was not a financial success, and this led to an erratic publishing schedule that frustrated readers. In comments written later, in the summer of 1996, Wagner cited poor sales, his weak business skills, and his 1991 divorce as the causes of a financial &quot;hole&quot; he was struggling to get out of. Despite Wagner&#x27;s increasing prominence as one of several acclaimed self-publishers of the period - along with Jeff Smith (&quot;Bone&quot;), Colleen Doran (&quot;A Distant Soil&quot;), James A. Owen (&quot;Starchild&quot;), and Sim (&quot;Cerebus&quot;) - the series stalled after Issue #12 in 1994. Collections of the &quot;Daily Texan&quot; strips and of the first volume of &quot;Snowblind&quot; were released, but Wagner said those sales were not enough to make continuation of the series financially viable.

In 1996 Wagner signed a deal with Antarctic Press to republish the series to date, along with new issues. Antarctic republished the original 12 issues from 1996 to 1998; a color &quot;#0&quot; issue was released to launch this reprint series, but it was the last new material published. Wagner claimed to have finished Issue #13, but in a 1999 interview in Beau Yarbrough&#x27;s &quot;Comics Wire&quot; at Comic Book Resources, he stated that the &quot;pitiful&quot; advance orders for that issue had led him to look for another way to make a living. Shortly after the cancellation of these orders, however, Antarctic employee Matthew High stated that these orders were in line with the publisher&#x27;s expectations and that Wagner had never turned in any art for #13. Wagner left the comics industry in 1998.

In 2006, Wagner announced that he would be finishing the &quot;Snowblind&quot; storyline as a webcomic. By the end of 2010 he admitted to regretting that announcement, as he was busy with paying work and the series was not high on his leisure-time priorities list. In 2008, to tide fans over while waiting for &quot;Snowblind&quot; to appear, he began work on an 8-page mini-comic unrelated to the &quot;Snowblind&quot; storyline. The minicomic was also not completed, updates ceasing after page 5, also because of work commitments.

<text>In the United States, abortion is a divisive issue in politics and culture wars, though a majority of Americans support access to abortion. Abortion laws vary widely from state to state.

From the American Revolution to the mid-19th century abortion was not an issue of significant controversy; most held to the traditional Protestant Christian belief that personhood began at quickening, sometime between 18 and 21 weeks. It was legal prior to quickening in every state under the common law. Connecticut was the first state to regulate abortion in 1821; it outlawed abortion after quickening, the moment in pregnancy when the pregnant woman starts to feel the fetus&#x27;s movement in the uterus, and forbade the use of poisons to induce one post-quickening. Many states subsequently passed various laws on abortion until the Supreme Court of the United States decisions of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and &quot;Doe v. Bolton&quot; decriminalized abortion nationwide in 1973. The &quot;Roe&quot; decision imposed a federally mandated uniform framework for state legislation on the subject. It also established a minimal period during which abortion is legal, with more or fewer restrictions throughout the pregnancy. Evangelical Christians were initially generally either supportive or indifferent to &quot;Roe&quot; — citing what they saw as a lack of biblical condemnation on the matter, its perceived affirmation of religious liberty, and furthering of non-intrusive government — but by the 1980s began to join anti-abortion Catholics to overturn the decision. That basic framework, modified in &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot; (1992), remained nominally in place, although the effective availability of abortion varied significantly from state to state, as many counties had no abortion providers. &quot;Casey&quot; held that a law could not place legal restrictions imposing an &quot;undue burden&quot; for &quot;the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.&quot; In December 2021, the FDA legalized telemedicine provision of medication abortion pills with delivery by mail, but many states have laws which restrict this option.

In 2022, &quot;Roe&quot; and &quot;Casey&quot; were overturned in &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;, ending protection of abortion rights by the United States Constitution and allowing individual states to regulate any aspect of abortion not preempted by federal law. Since 1976, the Republican Party has generally sought to restrict abortion access based on the stage of pregnancy or to criminalize abortion, whereas the Democratic Party has generally defended access to abortion and has made contraception easier to obtain.

The abortion-rights movement advocates for patient choice and bodily autonomy, while the anti-abortion movement maintains that the fetus has a right to live. Historically framed as a debate between the pro-choice and pro-life labels, most Americans agree with some positions of each side. Support for abortion gradually increased in the U.S. beginning in the early 1970s, and stabilized during the 2010s. The abortion rate has continuously declined from a peak in 1980 of 30 per 1,000 women of childbearing age (15–44) to 11.3 by 2018. In 2018, 78% of abortions were performed at 9 weeks or less gestation, and 92% of abortions were performed at 13 weeks or less gestation. By 2023, medication abortions accounted for 63% of all abortions. Almost 25% of women will have had an abortion by age 45, with 20% of 30 year olds having had one. In 2019, 60% of women who had abortions were already mothers, and 50% already had two or more children. Increased access to birth control has been statistically linked to reductions in the abortion rate. The first state to decriminalize abortion prior to &quot;Roe&quot; was Hawaii.

As of 2025, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Vermont, and Wyoming have a right to abortion in their state constitutions, either explicitly or as interpreted by the state supreme court. Other states, such as Oregon and Massachusetts, protect abortion under state law. The state constitutions of Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, and West Virginia explicitly contain no right to an abortion, while the state constitution of Nebraska prohibits abortion after the first trimester.

==Terminology==

The abortion debate most commonly relates to the induced abortion of a pregnancy, which is also how the term &quot;abortion&quot; is used in a legal sense. The terms &quot;elective abortion&quot; and &quot;voluntary abortion&quot; refer to the interruption of pregnancy, before viability, at the request of the woman but not for medical reasons. In medical parlance, &quot;abortion&quot; can refer to a spontaneous miscarriage or to an induced miscarriage before the fetus is viable. After viability, doctors call an induced miscarriage a &quot;termination of pregnancy&quot;.

==History==

===Early history and rise of anti-abortion legislation===
Abortion was a fairly common practice in the history of the United States, and was not always controversial. At a time when society was more concerned with the more serious consequence of women becoming pregnant out of wedlock, family affairs were handled out of public view. Abortion did not become a public controversy until the health risk of unsafe abortions by (female) unlicensed practitioners was brought to the public attention in the 19th century. James Mohr wrote that even though pre-quickening abortion was legal in the first three decades of the 19th century, only 1 in 25 to 1 in 30 pregnancies ended in abortion. By the 1850s and 1860s, this number had increased to 1 in 5 or 1 in 6. John Keown highlighted some challenges in pinning down the common law view, observing that &quot;evidence of quickening would clearly facilitate prosecution&quot;. In the mid-18th century, Benjamin Franklin included a recipe for an abortifacient in a math textbook. In 1728, Franklin condemned publisher Samuel Keimer for publishing an article on abortion. According to biographer Walter Isaacson, Franklin did not have a strong view on the issue. In &quot;The Speech of Polly Baker&quot;, Franklin places the blame for abortion and infanticide on the sexual double standard against women. He stated:

Forgive me Gentlemen, if I talk a little extravagantly on these Matters; I am no Divine: But if you, great Men, must be making Laws, do not turn natural and useful Actions into Crimes, by your Prohibitions. Reflect a little on the horrid Consequences of this Law in particular: What Numbers of procur&#x27;d Abortions! and how many distress&#x27;d Mothers have been driven, by the Terror of Punishment and public Shame, to imbrue, contrary to Nature, their own trembling Hands in the Blood of their helpless Offspring! Nature would have induc&#x27;d them to nurse it up with a Parent&#x27;s Fondness. &#x27;Tis the Law therefore, &#x27;tis the Law itself that is guilty of all these Barbarities and Murders. Repeal it then, Gentlemen; let it be expung&#x27;d for ever from your Books: And on the other hand, take into your wise Consideration, the great and growing Number of Batchelors in the Country, many of whom, from the mean Fear of the Expense of a Family, have never sincerely and honourably Courted a Woman in their Lives; and by their Manner of Living, leave unproduced (which I think is little better than Murder) Hundreds of their Posterity to the Thousandth Generation. Is not theirs a greater Offence against the Public Good, than mine? Compel them then, by a Law, either to Marry, or pay double the Fine of Fornication every Year.

In 1716, New York passed an ordinance prohibiting midwives from providing abortion. Founding Father and Second President of the United States John Adams praised the Spartan lawgiver Lycurgus for refusing his sister-in-law from having an abortion even though it prevented him from assuming power. Early U.S. statutes did not prohibit early-term abortions: for the most part, abortion was not a crime until quickening, and most exceptions to this in practice were penalties imposed on practitioners if a woman under their care died as a consequence of the procedure. Within the context of a sex scandal, Connecticut became the first state to regulate abortion by statute in 1821. Many states subsequently passed various abortion laws. In 1829, New York made post-quickening abortions a felony and pre-quickening abortions a misdemeanor. This was followed by 10 of the 26 states creating similar restrictions within the next few decades, in particular by the 1860s and 1870s. The first laws related to abortion were made to protect women from real or perceived risks, and those more restrictive penalized only the provider. Criminalization did not end the practice of abortion; unlicensed doctors and midwives continued to perform them. Most of the women receiving abortions from unlicensed practitioners were poor. Women&#x27;s safety continued to be a concern, especially after the highly publicized death of Mary Rogers. Wealthier women could pay willing physicians to broadly interpret health exceptions in their favor. Euphemistic advertisements for abortifacients offered an assortment of herbal remedies. Abortions increased during World War II as the need for female labor outweighed other concerns and bribes were often accepted in exchange for lax enforcement. Regulations were tightened after the war to encourage a return to traditional family life, until a reform movement started in the 1950s drawing attention to the public health issue of illegal abortions, and a consensus grew in the medical community that physicians should make decisions about when health exceptions apply.

A number of other factors likely played a role in the rise of anti-abortion laws. As in Europe, abortion techniques advanced starting in the 17th century, and the conservatism of most in the medical profession with regards to sexual matters prevented the wide expansion of abortion techniques. Physicians, who were the leading advocates of abortion criminalization laws, appear to have been motivated at least in part by advances in medical knowledge. Science had discovered that fertilization inaugurated a more or less continuous process of development, which produced a new human being. Quickening was found to be not more or less crucial in the process of gestation than any other step. Many physicians concluded that if society considered it unjustifiable to terminate pregnancy after the fetus had quickened, and if quickening was a relatively unimportant step in the gestation process, then it was just as wrong to terminate a pregnancy before quickening as after quickening. Patricia Cline Cohen, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said that these laws had come about not because society saw abortion as a crime but from a small group of doctors who had taken it upon themselves to prove to the rest of the county that pre-quickening abortion should be seen as a crime. The doctors used flawed math to convince the American Medical Association to accept that pre-quickening abortion should also be outlawed, leading to the raft of state laws banning abortion in the latter half of the 19th century. Doctors were also influenced by practical reasons to advocate anti-abortion laws. For one, abortion providers were usually female midwives without formal training or education. In an age where the leading doctors in the nation were attempting to standardize the medical profession, these unlicensed practitioners were considered a nuisance to public health.

Despite campaigns to end the practice of abortion, abortifacient advertising was highly effective and abortion was commonly practiced, with the help of a midwife or other women, in the mid-19th century, although they were not always safe. While the precise abortion rate was not known, James Mohr&#x27;s 1978 book &quot;Abortion in America&quot; documented multiple recorded estimates by 19th-century physicians, which suggested that between around 15% and 35% of all pregnancies ended in abortion during that period. This era also saw a marked shift in the people who were obtaining abortions. Before the start of the 19th century, most abortions were sought by unmarried women, who had become pregnant out of wedlock and for which there was much less compassion compared to married women who got an abortion; many of them were wealthy and paid well. Out of 54 abortion cases published in American medical journals between 1839 and 1880, over half were sought by married women, and well over 60% of the married women already had at least one child.

The sense that married women were now frequently obtaining abortions worried many conservative physicians, who were almost exclusively men. In the Reconstruction era, much of the blame was placed on the burgeoning women&#x27;s rights movement. Although the medical profession expressed hostility toward feminism, many feminists of the era were also opposed to abortion. In &quot;The Revolution&quot;, a newspaper operated by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, an 1869 opinion piece was published arguing that instead of merely attempting to pass a law against abortion, the root cause must also be addressed. The writer stated that simply passing an anti-abortion law would be &quot;only mowing off the top of the noxious weed, while the root remains. ... No matter what the motive, love of ease, or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent, the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed. It will burden her conscience in life, it will burden her soul in death; But oh! thrice guilty is he who drove her to the desperation which impelled her to the crime.&quot; To many feminists of this era, abortion was regarded as an undesirable necessity forced upon women by thoughtless men. The free love wing of the feminist movement refused to advocate for abortion and treated the practice as an example of the hideous extremes to which modern marriage was driving women. Marital rape and the seduction of unmarried women were societal ills, which feminists believed caused the need to abort, as men did not respect women&#x27;s right to abstinence. Feminist opposition to abortion was much less prevalent by the 20th century, and it was feminists and physicians who came to question anti-abortion laws and raise public interest in the 1960s.

Physicians, one of the most famous and consequential being Horatio Storer, remained the loudest voice in the anti-abortion debate, and they carried their agenda to state legislatures around the country, advocating not only anti-abortion laws but also laws against birth control on racist and pseudoscientific grounds; religious groups were not particularly active within this movement, which presaged the modern debate over women&#x27;s body rights. Although many of these laws indicated the woman as a co-criminal, she was rarely prosecuted. A campaign was launched against the movement and the use and availability of contraceptives. Criminalization of abortion accelerated from the late 1860s through the efforts of concerned legislators, doctors, and the American Medical Association influenced by Storer, and were facilitated by the press. In 1873, Anthony Comstock created the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, an institution dedicated to supervising the morality of the public. Later that year, Comstock successfully influenced the United States Congress to pass the Comstock Law, which made it illegal to deliver through the U.S. mail any &quot;obscene, lewd, or lascivious&quot; material. It also prohibited producing or publishing information pertaining to the procurement of abortion, birth control, and venereal disease, including to medical students. The production, publication, importation, and distribution of such materials was suppressed under the Comstock Law as being obscene, and similar prohibitions were passed by 24 of the 37 states.

By 1900, abortion was normally a felony in every state. Some states included provisions allowing for abortion in limited circumstances, generally to protect the woman&#x27;s health or to terminate pregnancies arising from rape or incest. Most Americans did not view abortion as a crime, and abortions continued to occur and became increasingly available. The American Birth Control League was founded by Margaret Sanger in 1921; it would become Planned Parenthood Federation of America in 1942. By the 1930s, licensed physicians performed an estimated 800,000 abortions a year.

=== Unsafe abortions ===
In 1988, 17 year old Becky Bell died from an infection after an unsafe abortion. She lived in Indiana where parental consent was required to have a safe and legal abortion. Laurence H. Tribe wrote in &quot;Abortion: The Clash of Absolutes&quot; that Bell&#x27;s best friend said that Becky &quot;couldn&#x27;t bear telling&quot; her parents and considered other alternatives like an out-of-state abortion. It&#x27;s not known if Becky attempted the abortion by herself but it was not done safely and she died from an infection. Her parents publicly campaigned against parental consent laws after her death.

Rosie Jimenez died from sepsis in 1977 following an abortion procedure at the home of a midwife who was not licensed to perform abortions. She did not go to a licensed physician because the Hyde Amendment barring public Medicaid funding for abortions had gone into effect after surviving a statutory challenge in &quot;Beal v. Doe&quot; and an Equal Protection challenge in &quot;Maher v. Roe&quot;.

Dr. Abu Hayat was convicted by a Manhattan Court in 1993 for performing an illegal third trimester abortion at his clinic in Alphabet City. The doctor began the dilation and evacuation procedure which was not legal in the third trimester. The baby was born alive before the procedure could be completed. She was missing an arm that had been severed during the D&amp;E.

He cited &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; when he appealed his conviction for assaulting the baby based on an argument that the baby had not yet been born when he attempted the procedure.

Another patient was forced to leave the clinic halfway through a procedure after Dr. Hayat demanded more money that her husband could not afford to pay. The patient nearly died and was treated at a local hospital for severe infection caused by pieces of dismembered fetus being left in her uterus. 17 year old Sophie McCoy died in 1990 from an infected uterine perforation after receiving an abortion at Dr. Hayat&#x27;s clinic.

Inequality in access to safe and legal abortions persists to this day whereby many women cannot afford to obtain a legal abortion; in such cases, women may turn to illegal abortion.

=== Sherri Finkbine ===

In the early 1960s, a controversy centered around children&#x27;s television host Sherri Finkbine that helped bring abortion and abortion law more directly into the American public eye. Living in the area of Phoenix, Arizona, Finkbine had had four healthy children; during her pregnancy with her fifth child, she discovered the child might have severe deformities when born. This was likely because Finkbine had been taking sleeping pills that she was unaware contained thalidomide, a drug that increases the risk of fetal deformities during pregnancy. Though Finkbine wanted an abortion, the abortion laws of Arizona only allowed abortions if a pregnancy posed a threat to the woman&#x27;s life. The situation gained public attention after Finkbine shared the story with a reporter from &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot;, who disclosed her identity in spite of her requests for anonymity. On August 18, 1962, Finkbine traveled to Sweden to obtain a legal abortion, where it was confirmed that the fetus had severe deformities.

===Pre-&quot;Roe&quot; precedents===
In 1964, Gerri Santoro of Connecticut died trying to obtain an illegal abortion, and her photo became the symbol of an abortion-rights movement. Some women&#x27;s rights activist groups developed their own skills to provide abortions to women who could not obtain them elsewhere. As an example, in Chicago, a group known as &quot;Jane&quot; operated a floating abortion clinic throughout much of the 1960s. Women seeking the procedure would call a designated number and be given instructions on how to find &quot;Jane&quot;.

In 1965, the U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; struck down one of the remaining contraception Comstock laws in Connecticut and Massachusetts. However, &quot;Griswold&quot; only applied to marital relationships, allowing married couples to buy and use contraceptives without government restriction. It took until 1972, with &quot;Eisenstadt v. Baird&quot;, to extend the precedent of &quot;Griswold&quot; to unmarried persons as well. Following the &quot;Griswold&quot; case, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) issued a medical bulletin accepting a recommendation from six years earlier that clarified that &quot;conception is the implantation of a fertilized ovum&quot;, and consequently birth control methods that prevented implantation became classified as contraceptives, not abortifacients.

In 1967, Colorado became the first state to decriminalize abortion in cases of rape, incest, or in which pregnancy would lead to permanent physical disability of the woman. Similar laws were passed in California, Oregon, and North Carolina. In 1970, Hawaii became the first state to legalize abortions on the request of the woman, and New York repealed its 1830 law and allowed abortions up to the 24th week of pregnancy. Similar laws were soon passed in Alaska and Washington. In 1970, Washington held a referendum on legalizing early pregnancy abortions, becoming the first state to legalize abortion through a vote of the people. A law in Washington, D.C., which allowed abortion to protect the life or health of the woman, was challenged in the Supreme Court in 1971 in &quot;United States v. Vuitch&quot;. The court upheld the law, deeming that &quot;health&quot; meant &quot;psychological and physical well-being&quot;, essentially allowing abortion in Washington, D.C. By the end of 1972, 13 states had a law similar to that of Colorado, while Mississippi allowed abortion in cases of rape or incest only and Alabama and Massachusetts allowed abortions only in cases where the woman&#x27;s physical health was endangered. In order to obtain abortions during this period, women would often travel from a state where abortion was illegal to one where it was legal. The legal position prior to &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; was that abortion was illegal in 30 states and legal under certain circumstances in 20 states.

In the late 1960s, a number of organizations were formed to mobilize opinion both against and for the legalization of abortion. In 1966, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops assigned Monsignor James T. McHugh to document efforts to reform abortion laws, and anti-abortion groups began forming in various states in 1967. In 1968, McHugh led an advisory group which became the National Right to Life Committee. The forerunner of the NARAL Pro-Choice America was formed in 1969 to oppose restrictions on abortion and expand access to abortion. Following &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, in late 1973, NARAL became the National Abortion Rights Action League.

===&quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;===

Prior to &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, 30 states prohibited abortion without exception, 16 states banned abortion except in certain special circumstances (e.g. rape, incest, and health threat to mother), 3 states allowed residents to obtain abortions, and New York allowed abortions generally. Early that year, on January 22, 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; invalidated all of these laws, and set guidelines for the availability of abortion. The decision returned abortion to its liberalized pre-1820 status. &quot;Roe&quot; established that the right of privacy of a woman to obtain an abortion &quot;must be considered against important state interests in regulation&quot;. &quot;Roe&quot; also established a trimester framework, defined as the end of the first pregnancy trimester (12 weeks), as the threshold for state interest, such that states were prohibited from banning abortion in the first trimester but allowed to impose increasing restrictions or outright bans later in pregnancy.

In deciding &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, the Court ruled that a Texas statute forbidding abortion except when necessary to save the life of the mother was unconstitutional. The Court arrived at its decision by concluding that the issue of abortion and abortion rights falls under the right of privacy in the United States (e.g. federal constitutionally-protected right), in the sense of the right of a person not to be encroached by the state. In its opinion, it listed several landmark cases where the court had previously found a right to privacy implied by the Constitution. The Court did not recognize a right to abortion in all cases, saying: &quot;State regulation protective of fetal life after viability thus has both logical and biological justifications. If the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.&quot;

The Court held that a right to privacy existed and included the right to have an abortion. The court found that a mother had a right to abortion until viability, a point to be determined by the abortion doctor. After viability a woman can obtain an abortion for health reasons, which the Court defined broadly to include psychological well-being. A central issue in the &quot;Roe&quot; case and in the wider abortion debate in general is whether human life or personhood begins at conception, birth, or at some point in between. The Court declined to make an attempt at resolving this issue, writing: &quot;We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man&#x27;s knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer.&quot; Instead, it chose to point out that historically, under English and American common law and statutes, &quot;the unborn have never been recognized ... as persons in the whole sense&quot;, and thus the fetuses are not legally entitled to the protection afforded by the right to life specifically enumerated in the Fourteenth Amendment. Rather than asserting that human life begins at any specific point, the Court declared that the state has a &quot;compelling interest&quot; in protecting &quot;potential life&quot; at the point of viability.

====&quot;Doe v. Bolton&quot;====

Under &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, state governments may not prohibit late terminations of pregnancy when &quot;necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother&quot;, even if it would cause the demise of a viable fetus. This rule was clarified by the 1973 judicial decision &quot;Doe v. Bolton&quot;, which specifies &quot;that the medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors—physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman&#x27;s age—relevant to the well-being of the patient&quot;. It is by this provision for the mother&#x27;s mental health that women in the U.S. legally choose abortion after viability when screenings reveal abnormalities that do not cause a baby to die shortly after birth.

===&quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot;===
In the 1992 case of &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot;, the Court abandoned &quot;Roe&#x27;s&quot; strict trimester framework but maintained its central holding that women have a right to choose to have an abortion before viability. &quot;Roe&quot; had held that statutes regulating abortion must be subject to &quot;strict scrutiny&quot;—the traditional Supreme Court test for impositions upon fundamental Constitutional rights. &quot;Casey&quot; instead adopted the lower, undue burden standard for evaluating state abortion restrictions, but re-emphasized the right to abortion as grounded in the general sense of liberty and privacy protected under the constitution: &quot;Constitutional protection of the woman&#x27;s decision to terminate her pregnancy derives from the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. It declares that no state shall &quot;deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.&quot; The controlling word in the cases before us is &#x27;liberty&#x27;.&quot;

The Supreme Court continues to make decisions on this subject. On April 18, 2007, it issued a ruling in the case of &quot;Gonzales v. Carhart&quot;, involving a federal law entitled the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 which President George W. Bush had signed into law. The law banned intact dilation and extraction, which opponents of abortion rights referred to as &quot;partial-birth abortion&quot;, and stipulated that anyone breaking the law would get a prison sentence up to 2.5 years. The United States Supreme Court upheld the 2003 ban by a narrow majority of 5–4, marking the first time the Court has allowed a ban on any type of abortion since 1973. The opinion, which came from justice Anthony Kennedy, was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and the two recent appointees, Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts.

In the case of &quot;Whole Woman&#x27;s Health v. Hellerstedt&quot;, the Supreme Court in a 5–3 decision on June 27, 2016, swept away forms of state restrictions on the way abortion clinics can function. The Texas legislature enacted in 2013 restrictions on the delivery of abortions services that, it was argued by its opponents, created an undue burden for women seeking an abortion by requiring abortion doctors to have difficult-to-obtain &quot;admitting privileges&quot; at a local hospital and by requiring clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities. The Court supported this argument and struck down these two provisions &quot;facially&quot; from the law at issue—that is, the very words of the provisions were invalid, no matter how they might be applied in any practical situation. According to the Supreme Court, the task of judging whether a law puts an unconstitutional burden on a woman&#x27;s right to abortion belongs with the courts, and not the legislatures.

The Supreme Court ruled similarly in &quot;June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo&quot; on June 29, 2020, in a 5–4 decision that a Louisiana state law, modeled after the Texas law at the center of &quot;Whole Woman&#x27;s Health&quot;, was unconstitutional. Like Texas&#x27; law, the Louisiana law required certain measures for abortion clinics that, if having gone into effect, would have closed five of the six clinics in the state. The case in Louisiana was put on hold pending the result of &quot;Whole Woman&#x27;s Health&quot;, and was retried based on the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision. While the District Court ruled the law unconstitutional, the Fifth Circuit found that unlike the Texas law, the burden of the Louisiana law passed the tests outlined in &quot;Whole Woman&#x27;s Health&quot;, and thus the law was constitutional. The Supreme Court issued an order to suspend enforcement of the law pending further review, and agreed to hear the case in full in October 2019. It was the first abortion-related case to be heard by President Donald Trump&#x27;s appointees to the Court, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. The Supreme Court found the Louisiana law unconstitutional for the same reasons as the Texas one, reversing the Fifth Circuit. The judgment was supported by Chief Justice John Roberts who had dissented on &quot;Whole Woman&#x27;s Health&quot; but joined in judgment as to upholding the court&#x27;s respect for the past judgment in that case.

===&quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;===

The Supreme Court granted &quot;certiorari&quot; to &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; in May 2021, a case that challenges the impact of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; in blocking enforcement of a 2018 Mississippi law (the Gestational Age Act) that had banned any abortions after the first 15 weeks. Oral arguments to &quot;Dobbs&quot; were held in December 2021, and a decision was expected by the end of the 2021–22 Supreme Court term. On September 1, 2021, Texas passed the Texas Heartbeat Act, one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation, banning most procedures after six weeks. On May 2, 2022, a leaked draft majority opinion for &quot;Dobbs&quot;, written by Samuel Alito, set to overturn &quot;Roe&quot; was reported by &quot;Politico&quot;.

On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court overruled both &quot;Roe&quot; and &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot; in the &quot;Dobbs&quot; case on originalist grounds that a right to abortion cannot be found in the U.S. Constitution. John Roberts, the Chief Justice of the United States, concurred in the decision to uphold the law at question as constitutional, by a 6–3 vote, but did not support overruling both &quot;Roe&quot; and &quot;Casey&quot;. This enabled trigger laws, which had been passed in 13 states, to effectively ban abortions in those states.

Abortion-related initiatives were placed on the 2022 ballot in six states, as 2022 California Proposition 1, 2022 Michigan Proposal 3, and 2022 Vermont Proposal 5 enshrined the right to an abortion in state constitutions, while the 2022 Kansas abortion referendum, 2022 Kentucky Amendment 2, and Montana Legislative Referendum No. 131 rejected restrictions on abortion. Voters in Ohio defeated August 2023 Ohio Issue 1 intended to make changes to the state&#x27;s constitution more difficult, ahead of November 2023 Ohio Issue 1, which added the right to an abortion to the Ohio constitution.

&quot;FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine&quot; brought into question the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#x27;s approval and rules around mifepristone, after lower courts had deemed the FDA&#x27;s approval unlawful. In Arizona, the state Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Planned Parenthood Arizona v. Mayes&quot; that instead of a 15-week ban on abortion passed by the state in 2022, that the state should follow a 1902 law, based on a pre-ratification 1864 law, that disallowed nearly any abortion except in the case of a medical emergency, though the state government repealed the 1902 law in May 2024 to allow the 2022 law to take precedence. Some Republicans, including allies of presidential candidate Donald Trump, have pushed Project 2025, a sweeping government reform plan that includes banning abortions at a federal level as well as access to medical abortions drugs. Democrats used the pushback against these Republican and conservative anti-abortion goals as a point of campaigning for the election.

Although all states allow abortion to prevent the woman&#x27;s imminent death, 5 woman have died to pregnancy related issues in Texas alone due to doctors refusing to execute abortions because of the states abortion law despite the de jure legal circumstances.

Abortion-related issues were a topic in the 2024 United States elections, including these referendums: 2024 Arizona Proposition 139, 2024 Colorado Amendment 79, 2024 Florida Amendment 4, 2024 Montana Initiative 128, 2024 Maryland Question 1, 2024 Missouri Amendment 3, 2024 New York Proposal 1, 2024 Nebraska Initiative 439, 2024 Nevada Question 6, and 2024 South Dakota Amendment G.

In 2026, 2024 Nevada Question 6 needs to be approved again to enshrine abortion in the state&#x27;s constitution, while legislators in Hawaii and Virginia proposed similar amendments to codify abortion rights in 2026.

== Fetal homicide laws ==

Gerardo Flores was convicted of two counts of capital murder in 2005 under Texas&#x27; fetal homicide law. His girlfriend Erica Basoria testified that she had asked him to step on her stomach because her attempts to induce miscarriage on herself had been unsuccessful. Flores said he initially refused but she would not relent until he agreed. Flores admitted to police that he &quot;accidentally, probably&quot; hit Basoria in the face during a fight on the night of the miscarriage. Basoria told police that he was not abusive. Texas&#x27; fetal homicide law did not allow charges against the mother because she had a right to terminate pregnancy, so only Flores was charged.

In 2019 a woman in Alabama was indicted after she was shot in the stomach for intentionally causing the death of &quot;unborn baby Jones by initiating a fight knowing she was five months pregnant&quot;. The charges were later dropped.

==Medical abortion==

Medical abortion via mifepristone and misoprostol was approved for abortion in the United States by the FDA in September 2000. , it was legal and available in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., Guam, and Puerto Rico. It was a prescription drug, and required that it could only be distributed to the public through specially qualified licensed physicians.

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic on December 16, 2021, in light of the difficulties in accessing in-person healthcare services, the FDA approved the distribution of mifepristone via mail. In states where abortion is banned or restricted, women are able to obtain pills through ordering from overseas online pharmacies, purchasing from pharmacies in Mexico, from services such as Aid Access, or through a network of U.S.-Mexico border organizations that includes Red Necesito Abortar, , and Marea Verde.&lt;ref name=&quot;msmagazine/marea-verde&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc/news/61874921&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dallasnews/influx-of-us-women&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;diario.mx/1934398&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2023, the U.S. Department of Justice stated that USPS mailing of pills for medication abortion, even into states where abortion services are restricted, does not violate federal law. In 2023, online access to abortion medication by mail delivered by the US Postal Service is currently available to citizens of all states.
In light of the &quot;Dobbs&quot; decision, the Alliance Defending Freedom launched a lawsuit in November 2022 in the Northern District of Texas under Judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk to seek to overturn the FDA&#x27;s original approval of mifepristone. The Alliance argued that the FDA had ignored some studies that showed the medication to have harmful side effects, while the current federal administration under Joe Biden, the manufacturers of the drugs, and several doctors vouched for the safety of the drugs and argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing. Judge Kacsmaryk ruled for the Alliance on April 7, 2023, reversing the FDA&#x27;s approval and banning mifepristone across the United States after seven days. A district judge in a separate lawsuit, Thomas O. Rice of the Eastern District of Washington, ruled that the FDA should not reverse access to mifepristone in 16 states. Kacsmaryk&#x27;s ruling was partially reversed by a panel on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, leaving mifepristone on the market but reverting efforts made by the FDA to liberalize its use over seven years. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, and on June 13, 2024, the court ruled that the Alliance Defending Freedom lacked standing to bring the suit.

==Legal status==

===Federal legislation===
Beyond limitations pertaining to abortion in the context of federal funding, there is little federal legislation protecting or penalizing abortion in the United States. Abortion is left to each individual state. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1531), Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994 (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 248), and Comstock Act of 1873 (codified at 18 U.S.C. 552, 18 U.S.C. 1461, 18 U.S.C. 1462, and 18 U.S.C.1463) are some of the few pieces of existing federal law that provide substantive criminal provisions either protecting or penalizing abortion. The provisions in the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act and the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act cover activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce, whereas the provisions of the Comstock Act cover activity using the mail or postal system. The Comstock Act is particularly punitive as a violation is considered a predicate offense for purposes of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or R.I.C.O..

Since 1995, led by congressional Republicans, the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate have moved several times to pass measures banning the procedure of intact dilation and extraction, commonly known as &quot;partial birth abortion&quot;. Such measures passed twice by wide margins, but President Bill Clinton vetoed those bills in April 1996 and October 1997 on the grounds that they did not include health exceptions. Congressional supporters of the bill argue that a health exception would render the bill unenforceable, since the &quot;Doe v. Bolton&quot; decision defined &quot;health&quot; in vague terms, justifying any motive for obtaining an abortion. Congress was unsuccessful with subsequent attempts to override the vetoes.

The Born-Alive Infants Protection Act (BAIPA) was enacted August 5, 2002, by an Act of Congress and signed into law by George W. Bush. It asserts the human rights of infants born after a failed attempt to induce abortion. A &quot;born-alive infant&quot; is specified as a &quot;person, human being, child, individual&quot;. &quot;Born alive&quot; is defined as the complete expulsion of an infant at any stage of development that has a heartbeat, pulsation of the umbilical cord, breath, or voluntary muscle movement, no matter if the umbilical cord has been cut or if the expulsion of the infant was natural, induced labor, cesarean section, or induced abortion. The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is a proposed piece of legislation that would result in criminal penalties for any practitioner who denies a born-alive infant care.

On October 2, 2003, with a vote of 281–142, the House approved the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act to ban intact dilation and extraction, with an exemption in cases of fatal threats to the woman. Through this legislation, a doctor could face up to two years in prison and civil lawsuits for performing such a procedure. A woman undergoing the procedure could not be prosecuted under the measure. On October 21, 2003, the United States Senate passed the bill by a vote of 64–34, with a number of Democrats joining in support. The bill was signed by President George W. Bush on November 5, 2003, but a federal judge blocked its enforcement in several states just a few hours after it became public law. The Supreme Court upheld the nationwide ban on the procedure in the case &quot;Gonzales v. Carhart&quot; on April 18, 2007, signaling a substantial change in the Court&#x27;s approach to abortion law. The 5–4 ruling said the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act does not conflict with previous decisions regarding abortion.

The judicial interpretation of the U.S. Constitution regarding abortion, following the Supreme Court of the United States&#x27;s 1973 landmark decision in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, and subsequent companion decisions, is that abortion is legal but may be restricted by the states to varying degrees. States have passed laws to restrict late-term abortions, require parental notification for minors, and mandate the disclosure of abortion risk information to patients prior to the procedure.

The official report of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, issued in 1983 after extensive hearings on the Human Life Amendment (proposed by Senators Orrin Hatch and Thomas Eagleton), stated: &quot;Thus, the [Judiciary] Committee observes that no significant legal barriers of any kind whatsoever exist today in the United States for a mother to obtain an abortion for any reason during any stage of her pregnancy.&quot;

One aspect of the legal abortion regime now in place has been determining when the fetus is &quot;viable&quot; outside the womb as a measure of when the &quot;life&quot; of the fetus is its own (and therefore subject to being protected by the state). In the majority opinion delivered by the court in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, viability was defined as &quot;potentially able to live outside the mother&#x27;s womb, albeit with artificial aid. Viability is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks&quot;. When the court ruled in 1973, the then-current medical technology suggested that viability could occur as early as 24 weeks. Advances over the past three decades allow survival of some babies born at 22 weeks.

, the youngest child to survive a premature birth in the United States was a girl born at Kapiolani Medical Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, at 21 weeks and 3 days gestation. Because of the split between federal and state law, legal access to abortion continues to vary by state. Geographic availability varies dramatically, with 87 percent of U.S. counties having no abortion provider. Moreover, due to the Hyde Amendment, many Medicaid state programs do not cover abortions; as of 2022, 17 states including California, Illinois, and New York offer or require such coverage.

The legality of abortion is frequently a major issue in nomination battles for the U.S. Supreme Court. Nominees typically remain silent on the issue during their hearings, as the issue may come before them as judges.

The Unborn Victims of Violence Act, commonly known as Laci and Conner&#x27;s Law, was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush on April 1, 2004, allowing two charges to be filed against someone who kills a pregnant mother (one for the mother and one for the fetus). It specifically bans charges against the mother and/or doctor relating to abortion procedures. Nevertheless, it has generated much controversy among pro-abortion rights advocates who view it as a potential step in the direction of banning abortion.

In 2021, the Women&#x27;s Health Protection Act, which would codify abortion rights into federal law, was introduced by Judy Chu. The bill passed the U.S. House of Representatives but was rejected by the U.S. Senate.

After the &quot;Dobbs&quot; decision, Merrick Garland, the U.S. Attorney General, asserted that under federal law, states do not have the right to restrict access to FDA-approved abortion pills, but Louisiana passed a law to ban mailing them.
Legal experts cited as a potentially persuasive precedent the 2014 district decision in &quot;Zogenix v. Patrick&quot;, in which the court ruled that under the doctrine of federal preemption, Massachusetts could not ban the opioid Zohydro because it had been approved by the FDA.

On September 13, 2022, Republican senator Lindsey Graham, who had previously stated that abortion should be left up to each state, introduced legislation that would ban abortion nationwide after 15 weeks of pregnancy with exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the patient, named the &quot;Protecting Pain-Capable Unborn Children from Late-Term Abortions Act&quot;. This law would require states to ban abortion after 15 weeks, but it would not require states with stricter bans to allow it up to that point. Despite the view that it &quot;gets the United States in line with other developed nations&quot;, it leaves out the fact that none of those nations ban abortion. Graham had previously introduced the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which set the period at 20 weeks.

===Penalties by state===
Currently, 13 states have criminal penalties for performing abortions, regardless of gestational age. The penalties in states that have made abortion illegal vary, as outlined below.

This chart lists only the penalties authorized specifically by the state laws which explicitly restrict (or ban) abortions. The chart does not address the risk of being prosecuted for violating any other law because of the abortion. The jurisprudence surrounding this question – whether laws such as &quot;fetal-personhood laws&quot;, or laws originally intended to protect pregnant women and their pregnancies from external aggressors, can now also be used to prosecute women who obtain abortions, or who terminate their own pregnancies, deliberately or unintentionally – is unsettled, variable, and, in some states, unclear.
States with criminal penalties that are blocked by a court, have yet to take effect, or are unenforced are denoted by a grey background.
===State-by-state legal status===


Prior to 2021, abortion was legal in all U.S. states, and every state had at least one abortion clinic. Abortion is a controversial political issue, and regular attempts to restrict it occur in most states. Two such cases, originating in Texas and Louisiana, led to the Supreme Court cases of &quot;Whole Woman&#x27;s Health v. Hellerstedt&quot; (2016) and &quot;June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo&quot; (2020) in which several Texas and Louisiana restrictions were struck down.

The issue of minors and abortion is regulated at the state level, and 37 states require some parental involvement, either in the form of parental consent or in the form of parental notification. In certain situations, the parental restrictions can be overridden by a court. Mandatory waiting periods, mandatory ultrasounds and scripted counseling are common abortion regulations. Abortion laws are generally stricter in conservative Southern states than they are in other parts of the country.

In 2019, New York passed the Reproductive Health Act (RHA), which repealed a pre-&quot;Roe&quot; provision that banned third-trimester abortions except in cases where the continuation of the pregnancy endangered a pregnant woman&#x27;s life.

Abortion in the Northern Mariana Islands, a United States Commonwealth territory, is illegal.

Alabama House Republicans passed a law on April 30, 2019, that will criminalize most abortion if it goes into effect. Dubbed the &quot;Human Life Protection Act&quot;, it offers only two exceptions: serious health risk to the mother or a lethal fetal anomaly. Amendments that would have added cases of rape or incest to the list of exceptions were rejected It will also make the procedure a Class A felony. Twenty-five male Alabama senators voted to pass the law on May 13. The next day, Alabama governor Kay Ivey signed the bill into law, primarily as a symbolic gesture in hopes of challenging &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; in the Supreme Court.

Since Alabama introduced the first modern anti-abortion legislation in April 2019, five other states have also adopted abortion laws including Mississippi, Kentucky, Ohio, Georgia and most recently Louisiana on May 30, 2019.

In May 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld an Indiana state law that requires fetuses which were aborted be buried or cremated. In a December 2019 case, the court declined to review a lower court decision which upheld a Kentucky law requiring doctors to perform ultrasounds and show fetal images to patients before abortions.

On June 29, 2020, previous Supreme Court rulings banning abortion restrictions appeared to be upheld when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the Louisiana anti-abortion law. Following the ruling, the legality of laws restricting abortion in states such as Ohio was then called into question. It was also noted that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who agreed that the Louisiana anti-abortion law was unconstitutional, had previously voted to uphold a similar law in Texas which was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016.

In May 2021, Texas lawmakers passed the Texas Heartbeat Act, banning abortions as soon as cardiac activity can be detected, typically as early as six weeks into pregnancy, and often before women know they are pregnant due to the length of the menstrual cycle (which usually lasts a median of four weeks and in some cases can be irregular). In order to avoid traditional constitutional challenges based on &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, the law provides that any person, with or without any vested interest, may sue anyone that performs or induces an abortion in violation of the statute, as well as anyone who &quot;aids or abets the performance or inducement of an abortion, including paying for or reimbursing the costs of an abortion through insurance or otherwise.&quot; The law was challenged in courts, though had yet to have a full formal hearing as its September 1, 2021, enactment date came due. Plaintiffs sought an order from the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the law from coming into effect, but the Court issued a denial of the order late on September 1, 2021, allowing the law to remain in effect. While unsigned, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Stephen Breyer wrote dissenting opinions joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor that they would have granted an injunction on the law until a proper judicial review.

On September 9, 2021, Merrick Garland, the Attorney General and head of the United States Department of Justice, sued Texas over the Texas Heartbeat Act on the basis that &quot;the law is invalid under the Supremacy Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, is preempted by federal law, and violates the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity&quot;. Garland further noted that the United States government has &quot;an obligation to ensure that no state can deprive individuals of their constitutional rights.&quot; The Complaint avers that Texas enacted the law &quot;in open defiance of the Constitution&quot;. The relief requested from the U.S. District Court in Austin, Texas includes a declaration that the Texas Act is unconstitutional, and an injunction against state actors as well as any and all private individuals who may bring a SB 8 action. The idea of asking a federal court to impose an injunction upon the entire civilian population of a state is unprecedented and has drawn eyebrows.

Colorado passed into law its Reproductive Health Equity Act in April 2022, which assures abortion rights for all citizens of the state. While the bill as passed maintained the &quot;status quo&quot; for abortion rights, it assures that &quot;every individual has a fundamental right to make decisions about the individual&#x27;s reproductive health care, including the fundamental right to use or refuse contraception; a pregnant individual has a fundamental right to continue a pregnancy and give birth or to have an abortion and to make decisions about how to exercise that right; and a fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus does not have independent or derivative rights under the laws of the state&quot; regardless of changes that may happen at the federal level.

On May 25, 2022, Oklahoma imposed a ban on elective abortions after Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt signed House Bill 4327. The bill bans elective abortion beginning at conception. The law also permits private citizens to file lawsuits against abortion providers who knowingly provide, perform, or induce elective abortions on a pregnant woman. Abortion in cases of rape, incest, or high-risk pregnancies continue to be permitted. A lawsuit was immediately filed by the ACLU in opposition to the bill. At the time of enactment, Oklahoma was the only U.S. state to have passed a bill imposing such restrictions; the law made Oklahoma the first U.S. state to ban elective abortion procedures since prior to the ruling and implementation of &quot;Roe&quot; in 1973.

After the Supreme Court overturned &quot;Roe&quot; on June 24, 2022, Texas and Missouri immediately banned abortions with the exception only if the pregnancy was deemed to be particularly life-threatening.

On January 28, 2023, the Minnesota state Senate passed a bill guaranteeing women&#x27;s rights to abortion and other reproductive medicine which was signed into law on January 31. The bill prohibits state and local governments from attempting to restrict access to sterilization or prenatal care, while also requiring contraceptive cost compensation.

In June 2024 abortion in Iowa was made illegal after 6 weeks of gestation, with exceptions for rape, incest, foetal abnormalities, and the mother&#x27;s life.

In 2023, five women launched a class action lawsuit against the State of Texas after they were reportedly denied abortions at a clinic in the State despite grave risks to their life. Four of the women traveled out of state in order to obtain an abortion, while the fifth only received the abortion in Texas when she was hospitalized after the fetus suffered a premature rupture of membranes. The case argues that the Texas law, which allows abortion if there is a health risk to the mother, is too vague and doctors will not perform an abortion for fear of legal repercussions.

===In response to the coronavirus pandemic===

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, anti-abortion government officials in several American states enacted or attempted to enact restrictions on abortion, characterizing it as a non-essential procedure that can be suspended during the medical emergency. The orders have led to several legal challenges and criticism by human rights groups and several national medical organizations, including the American Medical Association. Legal challenges on behalf of abortion providers, many of which were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood, successfully stopped most of the orders on a temporary basis.

One challenge was made against the FDA&#x27;s rule on the distribution of mifepristone (RU-486), one of the two-part drug regimen to induce abortions. Since 2000, it is only available through health providers under the FDA&#x27;s ruling. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, access to mifepristone was a concern, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists along with other groups sued to have the rule relaxed to allow women to be able to access mifepristone at home through mail-order or retail pharmacies. While the Fourth Circuit issued a preliminary injunction against the FDA&#x27;s ruling that would have allowed wider distribution, the Supreme Court ordered in a 6–3 decision in January 2021 to put a stay on the injunction, maintaining the FDA&#x27;s rule.

===Sanctuary cities===
Since 2019, the anti-abortion movement in the United States has sought declarations of &quot;sanctuary cit[ies] for the unborn&quot;. In June 2019, the city council of Waskom, Texas, voted to outlaw abortion in the city, declaring Waskom a &quot;sanctuary city for the unborn&quot; (the first such city to designate itself as such), as state governments elsewhere in the United States were also drafting abortion bans. , there is no abortion clinic in the city. The Waskom ordinance has led other small cities in Texas, and as of April 2021 in Nebraska, to vote in favor of becoming &quot;sanctuary cities for the unborn&quot;.

On April 6, 2021, Hayes Center, Nebraska, became the first city in Nebraska to outlaw abortion by local ordinance, declaring itself a &quot;sanctuary city for the unborn.&quot; The city of Blue Hill, Nebraska, followed suit and enacted a similar ordinance outlawing abortion on April 13, 2021. In May 2021, Lubbock, Texas, with a population of less than 270,000, voted to ban abortion with the &quot;sanctuary city for the unborn ordinance&quot;, becoming the largest city in the U.S. to ban abortion.

Abortion rights movements have also pushed for similar counterpart legislation in other cities.

==Abortion financing==

The abortion debate has also been extended to the question of who pays the medical costs of the procedure, with some states using the mechanism as a way of reducing the number of abortions.

The cost of an abortion varies depending on factors such as location, facility, timing, type of procedure, and whether or not there is insurance or some other type of financial assistance. In 2022, a medication abortion cost was about $580 at Planned Parenthood, though it could be more, up to around $800, in other facilities. During the first trimester an in-clinic abortion cost up to around $800, though often less; the average cost at Planned Parenthood was about $600. A second trimester procedure varied depending on the stage of pregnancy. The average ranged from about $715 earlier in the second trimester to $1,500–2,000 later in the second trimester. A variety of resources from support organizations are available to contribute to the costs of the procedure, as well as travel expenses.

===Abortion fund organizations===
A variety of organizations offer financial support for people seeking abortions, including travel and other expenses. Access Reproductive Care–Southeast (ARC Southeast), the Brigid Alliance, the Midwest Access Coalition (MAC), and the National Network of Abortion Funds are examples of such groups.

===Medicaid===
The Hyde Amendment is a federal legislative provision barring the use of federal Medicaid funds to pay for abortions except for rape and incest. The provision, in various forms, was in response to &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, and has been routinely attached to annual appropriations bills since 1976, and represented the first major legislative success by the pro-life movement. The law requires that states cover abortions under Medicaid in the event of rape, incest, and life endangerment.

===Private insurance===
* Six states require coverage in all private plans: California, Illinois, Maine, New York, Oregon, and Washington. (2021)
* Note: The following figures are from 2008 and may have changed since that time.
* 5 states (ID, KY, MO, ND, OK) restrict insurance coverage of abortion services in private plans: OK limits coverage to life endangerment, rape or incest circumstances; and the other four states limit coverage to cases of life endangerment.
* 11 states (CO, KY, MA, MS, NE, ND, OH, PA, RI, SC, VA) restrict abortion coverage in insurance plans for public employees, with CO and KY restricting insurance coverage of abortion under any circumstances.
* U.S. laws also ban federal funding of abortions for federal employees and their dependents, Native Americans covered by the Indian Health Service, military personnel and their dependents, and women with disabilities covered by Medicare.

===Mexico City policy===

Under this policy, U.S. federal funding to NGOs that provide abortion is not permitted. The policy was first announced by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. It has been rescinded by Democratic presidents and reinstated by Republican presidents. The policy was rescinded in 2021 by President Joe Biden.

==Qualifying requirements for abortion providers==
Qualifying requirements for performing abortions vary from state to state. Vermont has allowed physician assistants to do some first-trimester abortions since the mid-1970s. More recently, several states have changed their requirements for abortion providers, anticipating that the Supreme Court would overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;; now that the court has done so, more states are expanding eligibility to provide abortions. , California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington allow mid-level practitioners such as nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, and physicians assistants, to do some first-trimester abortions. In other states, non-physicians are not permitted to perform abortions.

==Statistics==

Because reporting of abortions is not mandatory, statistics are of varying reliability. Both the Centers For Disease Control (CDC) and the Guttmacher Institute regularly compile these statistics.

===Number of abortions===

The annual number of legal induced abortions in the U.S. doubled between 1973 and 1979, and peaked in 1990. There was a slow but steady decline throughout the 1990s. Overall, the number of annual abortions decreased by 6% between 2000 and 2009, with temporary spikes in 2002 and 2006.

By 2011, abortion rate in the nation dropped to its lowest point since the Supreme Court legalized the procedure. According to a study performed by Guttmacher Institute, long-acting contraceptive methods had a significant impact in reducing unwanted pregnancies. There were fewer than 17 abortions for every 1,000 women of child-bearing age. That was a 13%-decrease from 2008&#x27;s numbers and slightly higher than the rate in 1973, when the Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; decision legalized abortion. The study indicated a long-term decline in the abortion rate.

In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 623,471 abortions, a 2% decrease from 636,902 in 2015.

During the first six months of 2023 (following &quot;Dobbs&quot; in 2022), the numbers of abortions in certain U.S. states changed dramatically compared to the same time period in 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Abortions tripled in New Mexico and Wyoming and more than doubled in South Carolina and Kansas. For 13 states that had banned abortion, the Guttmacher Institute had no 2023 data to make the comparison.

===Medical abortions===
A Guttmacher Institute survey of abortion providers estimated that early medical abortions accounted for 17% of all non-hospital abortions and slightly over one-quarter of abortions before 9 weeks gestation in the United States in 2008. Medical abortions voluntarily reported to the CDC by 34 reporting areas (excluding Alabama, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) and published in its annual abortion surveillance reports have increased every year since the September 28, 2000 FDA approval of mifepristone (RU-486): 1.0% in 2000, 2.9% in 2001, 5.2% in 2002, 7.9% in 2003, 9.3% in 2004, 9.9% in 2005, 10.6% in 2006, 13.1% in 2007, 15.8% in 2008, 17.1% in 2009 (25.2% of those at less than 9 weeks gestation). Medical abortions accounted for 32% of first-trimester abortions at Planned Parenthood clinics in 2008. By 2020, medication abortions accounted for more than 50% of all abortions. In 2023, medication abortions obtained within the formal health care system had risen to 63% of all abortions, with the total percentage (which would include self-managed abortions by individuals in states with total bans) likely higher.

===Abortion and religion===
A majority of abortions are obtained by religiously identified women. According to the Guttmacher Institute, &quot;more than 7 in 10 U.S. women obtaining an abortion report a religious affiliation (37% Protestant, 28% Catholic, and 7% other), and 25% attend religious services at least once a month. The abortion rate for Protestant women is 15 per 1,000 women, while Catholic women have a slightly higher rate, 20 per 1,000.&quot;

===Abortion and ethnicity===
Abortion rates tend to be higher among minority women in the United States. In 2000–2001, the rates among black and Hispanic women were 49 per 1,000 and 33 per 1,000, respectively, vs. 13 per 1,000 among non-Hispanic white women. This figure includes all women of reproductive age, including women that are not pregnant. In other words, these abortion rates reflect the rate at which U.S. women of reproductive age have an abortion each year.

In 2004, the rates of abortion by ethnicity in the U.S. were 50 abortions per 1,000 black women, 28 abortions per 1,000 Hispanic women, and 11 abortions per 1,000 white women.

In 2024, the abortion rate for black women was nearly three times higher than for white women, while for Hispanic women, it was nearly two times higher than the rate for white women.

===In-state vs. out-of-state ===

Roe v. Wade legalized abortion nationwide in 1973. In 1972, 41% of abortions were performed on women outside their state of residence, while in 1973 it declined to 21%, and then to 11% in 1974.

In the decade from 2011 to 2020, during which many states increased abortion restrictions, the percentage of women nationwide who traveled out of state for an abortion increased steadily, from 6% in 2011 to 9% in 2020. Out of state travel for an abortion was much more prevalent in the 29 states hostile to abortion rights, with percentages in those states rising from 9% in 2011 to 15% by 2020, while in states supportive of abortion rights, out of state travel for abortions rose from 2% to 3% between 2011 and 2020.

Gutttmacher has released data about abortions by &quot;state of occurrence&quot; and &quot;state of residence.&quot; In some states, these numbers can be tremendously different, for example in Missouri, a state very hostile to abortion rights, the &quot;abortion rate by state of occurrence&quot; dropped from 4 in 1000 women aged 15–44 for 2017 to 0.1 for 2020, because 57% of abortion recipients went out of state in 2017, while 99% did so in 2020. In contrast, from 2017 to 2020, the &quot;abortion rate by state of residence&quot; for Missourians went up by 18% from 8.4 to 9.9.

Some out of state travel pertains to locations of population centers in states; if large cities are close to state borders it may be common to cross borders for an abortion. For example, Delaware, which is generally supportive of abortion rights, saw 44% of residents obtain their abortions in neighboring states.

=== Motherhood ===
In 2019, 60% of women who had abortions were already mothers, and 50% already had two or more children.

===Reasons for abortions===

A 1998 study revealed that in 1987 to 1988, women reported the following as their primary reasons for choosing an abortion:

The source of this information takes findings into account from 27 nations including the United States, and therefore, these findings may not be typical for any one nation.

According to a 1987 study that included specific data about late abortions (i. e., abortions &quot;at 16 or more weeks&#x27; gestation&quot;), women reported that various reasons contributed to their having a late abortion:

In 2000, cases of rape or incest accounted for 1% of abortions.

A 2004 study by the Guttmacher Institute reported that women listed the following amongst their reasons for choosing to have an abortion:

A 2008 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) shows that rates of unintended pregnancy are highest among Blacks, Hispanics, and women with lower socio-economic status.
* 70% of all pregnancies among Black women were unintended
* 57% of all pregnancies among Hispanic women were unintended
* 42% of all pregnancies among White women were unintended

===When women have abortions (by gestational age)===

According to the Centers for Disease Control, in 2011, most (64.5%) abortions were performed by ≤8 weeks&#x27; gestation, and nearly all (91.4%) were performed by ≤13 weeks&#x27; gestation. Few abortions (7.3%) were performed between 14 and 20 weeks&#x27; gestation or at ≥21 weeks&#x27; gestation (1.4%). From 2002 to 2011, the percentage of all abortions performed at ≤8 weeks&#x27; gestation increased 6%.

===Safety of abortions===
The risk of death from carrying a child to term in the U.S. is approximately 14 times greater than the risk of death from a legal abortion. In 2012, the mortality rate from legal abortion was 0.6 abortion-related deaths per 100,000 abortions. The risk of abortion-related mortality increases with gestational age, but remains lower than that of childbirth through at least 21 weeks&#x27; gestation.

For the period 2013 – 2019, the rate of mortality from legal abortion procedures in the US was 0.43 abortion-related deaths per 100,000 reported legal abortions, lower than the rates for previous 5-year periods. In 2019, there were four identified deaths related to abortion in the US, out of 625,000 abortions.

===Birth control effects===

Increased access to birth control has been statistically linked to reductions in the abortion rate. As an element of family planning, birth control was federally subsidized for low income families in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s War on Poverty program. In 1970, Congress passed Title X to provide family planning services for those in need, and President Richard Nixon signed it into law. Funding for Title X rose from $6 million in 1971 to $61 million the next year, and slowly increased each year to $317 million in 2010, after which it was reduced by a few percent.

In 2011, the Guttmacher Institute reported that the number of abortions in the U.S. would be nearly two-thirds higher without access to birth control. In 2015, the Federation of American Scientists reported that federally mandated access to birth control had helped reduce teenage pregnancies in the U.S. by 44 percent, and had prevented more than 188,000 unintended pregnancies.

==Public opinion==


Americans have been equally divided on the issue; a May 2018 Gallup poll indicated that 48% of Americans described themselves as &quot;pro-choice&quot; and 48% described themselves as &quot;pro-life&quot;. A July 2018 poll indicated that 64% of Americans did not want the Supreme Court to overturn &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, while 28% did. The same poll found that support for abortion being generally legal was 60% during the first trimester of pregnancy, dropping to 28% in the second trimester, and 13% in the third trimester.

Support for the legalization of abortion has been consistently higher among more educated adults than less educated, and in 2019, 70% of college graduates support abortion being legal in all or most cases, compared to 60% of those with some college, and 54% of those with a high school degree or less.

In January 2013, a majority of Americans believed abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to a poll by NBC News and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. Approximately 70% of respondents in the same poll opposed &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; being overturned. A poll by the Pew Research Center yielded similar results. Moreover, 48% of Republicans opposed overturning &quot;Roe&quot;, compared to 46% who supported overturning it.

Gallup declared in May 2010 that more Americans identifying as &quot;pro-life&quot; is &quot;the new normal&quot;, while also noting that there had been no increase in opposition to abortion. It suggested that political polarization may have prompted more Republicans to call themselves &quot;pro-life&quot;. The terms &quot;pro-choice&quot; and &quot;pro-life&quot; do not always reflect a political view or fall along a binary; in one Public Religion Research Institute poll, seven in ten Americans described themselves as &quot;pro-choice&quot; while almost two-thirds described themselves as &quot;pro-life&quot;. The same poll found that 56% of Americans were in favor of legal access to abortion in all or some cases.

A 2022 study reviewing the literature and public opinion datasets found that 43.8% of survey respondents in the U.S. consistently support both elective and traumatic abortion, whereas only 14.8% consistently oppose abortion irrespective of the reason, and others differ in their degree of support for abortion depending on the circumstances of the abortion. 90% approve of abortion when the health of the woman is endangered, 77.4% when there is a strong chance of defects in the baby that could result from the pregnancy, and 79.5% when the pregnancy is the result of rape.

A 2022 poll by the Pew Research Center, found that 47% polled said that women who had an illegal abortion should face a penalty. 14% said they should face jail time, 16% said a fine or community services and 17% were not sure the penalty.

A January 2023 Gallup poll found that nearly 7 in 10 Americans disapprove of the country&#x27;s abortion policies, the highest rate in 23 years.

=== By gender and age ===

Pew Research Center polling shows little change in views from 2008 to 2012; modest differences based on gender or age.

The original article&#x27;s table also shows by party affiliation, religion, and education level.
=== By educational level ===
Support for the legalization of abortion is significantly higher among more educated adults than less educated, and has been consistently so for decades. In 2019, 70% of college graduates support abortion being legal in all or most cases, as well as 60% of those with some college education, compared to 54% of those with a high school degree or less.

=== By gender, party, and region ===
A January 2003 CBS News/&quot;The New York Times&quot; poll examined whether Americans thought abortion should be legal or not, and found variations in opinion which depended upon party affiliation and the region of the country. The margin of error is +/– 4% for questions answered of the entire sample (overall figures) and may be higher for questions asked of subgroups (all other figures).
===By trimester of pregnancy===

A CNN/&quot;USA Today&quot;/Gallup poll in January 2003 asked about the legality of abortion by , using the question, &quot;Do you think abortion should generally be legal or generally illegal during each of the following stages of pregnancy?&quot; This same question was also asked by Gallup in March 2000 and July 1996. Polls indicates general support of legal abortion during the first trimester, although support drops dramatically for abortion during the second and third trimester.

Since the 2011 poll, support for legal abortion during the first trimester has declined. 
===By circumstance or reasons===
According to Gallup&#x27;s long-time polling on abortion, the majority of Americans are neither strictly &quot;pro-life&quot; or &quot;pro-choice&quot;; it depends upon the circumstances of the pregnancy. Gallup polling from 1996 to 2021 consistently reveals that when asked the question, &quot;Do you think abortions should be legal under any circumstances, legal only under certain circumstances, or illegal in all circumstances?&quot;, Americans repeatedly answer &quot;legal only under certain circumstances&quot;. According to the poll, in any given year 48–57% say legal only under certain circumstances, 21–34% say legal under any circumstances, and 13–19% illegal in all circumstances, with 1–7% having no opinion.

According to the aforementioned poll, Americans differ drastically based upon situation of the pregnancy, suggesting they do not support unconditional abortions. Based on two separate polls taken May 19–21, 2003, of 505 and 509 respondents respectively, Americans stated their approval for abortion under these various circumstances:

Another separate trio of polls taken by Gallup in 2003, 2000, and 1996, revealed public support for abortion as follows for the given criteria:

Gallup furthermore established public support for many issues supported by the anti-abortion community and opposed by the abortion rights community:

An October 2007 CBS News poll explored under what circumstances Americans believe abortion should be allowed, asking the question, &quot;What is your personal feeling about abortion?&quot; The results were as follows:
===Additional polls===

* A June 2000 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; survey found that, although 57% of polltakers considered abortion to be murder, half of that 57% believed in allowing women access to abortion. The survey also found that, overall, 65% of respondents did not believe abortion should be legal after the first trimester, including 72% of women and 58% of men. Further, the survey found that 85% of Americans polled supported abortion in cases of risk to a woman&#x27;s physical health, 54% if the woman&#x27;s mental health was at risk, and 66% if a congenital abnormality was detected in the fetus.
* A July 2002 Public Agenda poll found that 44% of men and 42% of women thought that &quot;abortion should be generally available to those who want it&quot;, 34% of men and 35% of women thought that &quot;abortion should be available, but under stricter than limits it is now&quot;, and 21% of men and 22% of women thought that &quot;abortion should not be permitted&quot;.
* A January 2003 ABC News/&quot;The Washington Post&quot; poll also examined attitudes towards abortion by gender. In answer to the question, &quot;On the subject of abortion, do you think abortion should be legal in all cases, legal in most cases, illegal in most cases or illegal in all cases?&quot;, 25% of women responded that it should be legal in &quot;all cases&quot;, 33% that it should be legal in &quot;most cases&quot;, 23% that it should be illegal in &quot;most cases&quot;, and 17% that it should be illegal in &quot;all cases&quot;. 20% of men thought it should be legal in &quot;all cases&quot;, 34% legal in &quot;most cases&quot;, 27% illegal in &quot;most cases&quot;, and 17% illegal in &quot;all cases&quot;.
* Most Fox News viewers favor both parental notification as well as parental consent, when a minor seeks an abortion. A Fox News poll in 2005 found that 78% of people favor a notification requirement, and 72% favor a consent requirement.
* An April 2006 Harris poll on &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, asked, &quot;In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that states&#x27; laws which made it illegal for a woman to have an abortion up to three months of pregnancy were unconstitutional, and that the decision on whether a woman should have an abortion up to three months of pregnancy should be left to the woman and her doctor to decide. In general, do you favor or oppose this part of the U.S. Supreme Court decision making abortions up to three months of pregnancy legal?&quot;, to which 49% of respondents indicated favor while 47% indicated opposition. The Harris organization has concluded from this poll that, &quot;49 percent now support Roe vs. Wade&quot;.
* Two polls were released in May 2007 asking Americans &quot;With respect to the abortion issue, would you consider yourself to be pro-choice or pro-life?&quot; May 4–6, a CNN poll found 45% said &quot;pro-choice&quot; and 50% said pro-life. Within the following week, a Gallup poll found 50% responding &quot;pro-choice&quot; and 44% pro-life.
* In 2011, a poll conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 43% of respondents identified themselves as both &quot;pro-life&quot; and &quot;pro-choice&quot;.

===Intact dilation and extraction===
In 2003, the U.S. Congress outlawed intact dilation and extraction when it passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. A Rasmussen Reports poll four days after the Supreme Court&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Gonzales v. Carhart&quot; found that 40% of respondents &quot;knew the ruling allowed states to place some restrictions on specific abortion procedures.&quot; Of those who knew of the decision, 56% agreed with the decision and 32% were opposed. An ABC poll from 2003 found that 62% of respondents thought &quot;partial-birth abortion&quot; should be illegal; a similar number of respondents wanted an exception &quot;if it would prevent a serious threat to the woman&#x27;s health&quot;.

Gallup has repeatedly queried the American public on this issue.

==Positions of political parties==
After &quot;Roe&quot;, there was a national political realignment surrounding abortion. The abortion-rights movement in the United States initially emphasized the national policy benefits of abortion, such as smaller welfare expenses, slower population growth, and fewer illegitimate births. The abortion-rights movement drew support from the population control movement, feminists, and environmentalists. Anti-abortion advocates and civil-rights activists accused abortion-rights supporters of intending to control the population of racial minorities and the disabled, citing their ties to racial segregationists and eugenicist legal reformers. The abortion-rights movement subsequently distanced from the population control movement, and responded by taking up choice-based and rights-oriented rhetoric similar to what was used in the &quot;Roe&quot; decision. Opponents of abortion experienced a political shift. The Catholic Church and the Democratic Party supported an expansive welfare state, wanted to reduce rates of abortion through prenatal insurance and federally funded day care, and opposed abortion at the time of &quot;Roe&quot;. Afterwards, the anti-abortion movement in the United States shifted more to Protestant faiths that saw abortion rights as part of a liberal-heavy agenda to fight against, and became part of the new Christian right. The Protestant influence helped make opposition to abortion part of the Republican Party&#x27;s platform by the 1990s. Republican-led states enacted laws to restrict abortion, including abortions earlier than &quot;Casey&quot;″s general standard of 24 weeks.

Into the 21st century, although members of both major U.S. political parties come down on either side of the issue, the Republican Party is often seen as being anti-abortion, since the official party platform opposes abortion and considers fetuses to have an inherent right to life. Republicans for Choice represents the minority of that party. In 2006, pollsters found that 9% of Republicans favor the availability of abortion in most circumstances. Of Republican National Convention delegates in 2004, 13% believed that abortion should be generally available, and 38% believed that it should not be permitted. The same poll showed that 17% of all Republican voters believed that abortion should be generally available to those who want it, while 38% believed that it should not be permitted. The Republican Party was supportive of abortion rights prior to 1976 Republican National Convention, at which they supported an anti-abortion constitutional amendment as a temporary political ploy to gain more support from Catholics; this stance brought many more social conservatives into the party resulting in a large and permanent shift toward support of the anti-abortion position. The Democratic Party platform considers abortion to be a woman&#x27;s right. Democrats for Life of America represents the minority of that party. In 2006, pollsters found that 74% of Democrats favor the availability of abortion in most circumstances. Of Democratic National Convention delegates in 2004, 75% believed that abortion should be generally available, and 2% believed that abortion should not be permitted. The same poll showed that 49% of all Democratic voters believed that abortion should be generally available to those who want it, while 13% believed that it should not be permitted.

The position of U.S. third political parties and other U.S. minor political parties is diverse. The Green Party supports legal abortion as a woman&#x27;s right. While abortion is a contentious issue and the Maryland-based Libertarians for Life opposes the legality of abortion in most circumstances, the Libertarian Party platform (2012) states that &quot;government should be kept out of the matter, leaving the question to each person for their conscientious consideration.&quot; The Constitution Party is opposed to abortion.

The issue of abortion has become deeply politicized. In 2002, 84% of state Democratic platforms supported the right to having an abortion while 88% of state Republican platforms opposed it. This divergence also led to Christian right organizations like Christian Voice, Christian Coalition of America, and Moral Majority having an increasingly strong role in the Republican Party. This opposition has been extended under the Foreign Assistance Act; in 1973, Jesse Helms introduced an amendment banning the use of aid money to promote abortion overseas, and in 1984 the Mexico City policy prohibited financial support to any overseas organization that performed or promoted abortions. The policy was revoked by President Bill Clinton and subsequently reinstated by President George W. Bush. President Barack Obama overruled this policy by Executive Order on January 23, 2009, and it was reinstated on January 23, 2017, by President Donald Trump. On January 28, 2021, President Joe Biden signed a Presidential Memorandum that repealed the restoration of Mexico City policy and also called for the United States Department of Health and Human Services to &quot;suspend, rescind or revoke&quot; restrictions made to Title X. President Donald Trump reinstated the policy on January 24, 2025.

==Effects of legalization and impact of abortion bans==

The risk of death due to legal abortion has fallen considerably since &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; (1973) legalized it; this was due to increased physician skills, improved medical technology, and earlier termination of pregnancy. From 1940 through 1970, deaths of pregnant women during abortion fell from nearly 1,500 to a little over 100. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of women who died in 1972 from illegal abortion was thirty-nine. The Roe effect is a hypothesis suggesting that since supporters of abortion rights cause the erosion of their own political base by having fewer children, the practice of abortion will eventually lead to the restriction or illegalization of abortion. The legalized abortion and crime effect is another controversial theory that posits legal abortion reduces crime because unwanted children are more likely to become criminals.

Since &quot;Roe&quot;, there have been numerous attempts to reverse the decision. In the 2011 election season, Mississippi placed an amendment on the ballot that redefined how the state viewed abortion. The personhood amendment defined personhood as &quot;every human being from the moment of fertilization, cloning or the functional equivalent thereof&quot;; if passed, it would have been illegal to get an abortion in the state. On July 11, 2012, a Mississippi federal judge ordered an extension of his temporary order to allow the state&#x27;s only abortion clinic to stay open. The order was to stay in place until U.S. District Judge Daniel Porter Jordan III could review newly drafted rules on how the Mississippi Department of Health would administer a new abortion law. The law in question came into effect on July 1, 2012.

Between 2008 and 2016, the Turnaway Study followed a group of 1,000 women, two of whom died after giving birth, for five years after they sought an abortion, and compared their health and socio-economic consequences of receiving an abortion or being denied one. The study found that those who were provided with abortion performed better, and those who were denied one suffered negative consequences. &quot;Scientific American&quot; described it as landmark. A follow-up Turnaway Study was confirmed to determinate the health and economic impact of &quot;Roe&quot; being overturned, which other scholars also analyzed. According to a 2019 study, were &quot;Roe&quot; reversed and abortion bans implemented in states with trigger laws, including states considered highly likely to ban abortion, &quot;increases in travel distance are estimated to prevent 93,546 to 143,561 women from accessing abortion care.&quot;

For the &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; case, which confirmed the May 2022 leaks obtained by &quot;Politico&quot; and overruled &quot;Roe&quot; and &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot; in June 2022, among the over 130 &quot;amici curiae&quot; briefs, hundreds of scientists provided evidence, data, and studies, in particular the Turnaway Study, in favor of abortion rights and to rebuke arguments made to the Court that abortion &quot;has no beneficial effect on women&#x27;s lives and careers—and might even cause them harm&quot;. The American Historical Association (AHA) and the Organization of American Historians (OAH) were among those who signed an &quot;amici curiae&quot; brief for &quot;Dobbs&quot;, and were cited, among others, by &quot;Reason&quot;, &quot;Syracuse University News&quot;, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. AHA and OAH jointly issued a statement against the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision, which was reported by &quot;Anchorage Daily News&quot;, &quot;Inside Higher Ed&quot;, &quot;Insight Into Diversity&quot;, and the &quot;Strict Scrutiny&quot; podcast from Crooked Media, saying they have &quot;declined to take seriously the historical claims of our [amicus curiae] brief&quot;. Joined by at least 30 other academic and scholarly institutions, they condemned &quot;the court&#x27;s misinterpretation about the history of legalized abortion&quot; and said it has &quot;the potential to exacerbate historic injustices and deepen inequalities in our country&quot;.

===Travel to Mexico===
In the wake of state abortion bans and restrictions in the United States, Americans have started traveling to Mexico for abortions, and Mexico has expressed a willingness to help.

Due to a unanimous 2021 Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation decision that penalties for abortion violate women&#x27;s rights, abortion-providers are not prosecuted even in states where abortion remains illegal under state law; there are also legal exemptions for rape and medical reasons, and a police report is not required for a rape exemption. Providers openly treat American travelers in several states where abortion remains technically illegal, such as Nuevo Leon, which neighbors Texas. Following the Supreme Court ruling, elective abortion is being gradually legalized at the state level, and as of 2025 is legal during the first trimester (before the 13th week after implantation) in twenty states and Mexico City.

==Unintended live birth==
Although it is uncommon, women sometimes give birth in spite of an attempted abortion. Reporting of live birth after attempted abortion may not be consistent from state to state, but 38 were recorded in one study in upstate New York in the two-and-a-half years before &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. Under the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002, medical staff must report live birth if they observe any breathing, heartbeat, umbilical cord pulsation, or confirmed voluntary muscle movement, regardless of whether the born-alive is non-viable &quot;ex utero&quot; in the long term because of birth defects, and regardless of gestational age, including gestational ages which are too early for long-term viability &quot;ex utero&quot;.

<text>The abortion debate is a longstanding and contentious discourse that touches on the moral, legal, medical, and religious aspects of induced abortion. In English-speaking countries, the debate has two major sides, commonly referred to as the &quot;pro-choice&quot; and &quot;pro-life&quot; movements. Generally, supporters of &quot;pro-choice&quot; argue for the right to choose to terminate a pregnancy. They take into account various factors such as the stage of fetal development, the health of the woman, and the circumstances of the conception. By comparison, the supporters of &quot;pro-life&quot; generally argue that a fetus is a human being with inherent rights and intrinsic value, and thus, cannot be overridden by the woman&#x27;s choice or circumstances and that abortion is morally wrong in most or all cases. Both the terms &quot;pro-choice&quot; and &quot;pro-life&quot; are considered loaded words in mainstream media, which tend to prefer terms such as &quot;abortion rights&quot; or &quot;anti-abortion&quot; as more neutral and avoidant of bias.

Each movement has had varying results in influencing public opinion and attaining legal support for its position. Supporters and opponents of abortion often argue that it is essentially a moral issue, concerning the beginning of human personhood, rights of the fetus, and bodily integrity. Additionally, some argue that government involvement in abortion-related decisions, particularly through public funding, raises ethical and political questions. Libertarians, for example, may oppose taxpayer funding for abortion based on principles of limited government and personal responsibility, while holding diverse views on the legality of the procedure itself. The debate has become a political and legal issue in some countries with those who oppose abortion seeking to enact, maintain, and expand anti-abortion laws, while those who support abortion seek to repeal or ease such laws and expand access to the procedure. Abortion laws vary considerably between jurisdictions, ranging from outright prohibition of the procedure to public funding of abortion. The availability of abortion procedures considered safe also varies across the world and exists mainly in places that legalize abortion.

==Overview==
In ancient times, issues such as abortion and infanticide were evaluated by patriarchies within the contexts of family planning, gender selection, population control, and property rights. The rights of the prospective mother and child were typically not central to these considerations. Ancient discourse often expressed the concerns on the nature of humankind, the existence of a soul, when life begins, and the beginning of human personhood, issues that are still relevant even today.

Discussion of the presumed personhood of a fetus may be complicated by the current legal status of children. Similar to minors, fetuses and embryos lack certain legal capacities. In many legal systems, a fetus or an embryo does not have the same legal status as a person. They have not reached the age of majority and deemed not able to enter into contracts and to sue or be sued. Since the 1860s, they have been treated as persons for the limited purposes of offence against the person law in the UK including Northern Ireland, although this treatment was amended by the Abortion Act of 1967 in England, Scotland, and Wales. In America, there have been logistical challenges in considering a fetus as a person. Some legal interpretations have argued that if a fetus is considered a person, then it is only under certain conditions as it relies on the body of another person and is usually not the object of direct action by another person. In the current debate, proposals range from prohibitions on abortion in all cases, even when the woman&#x27;s life is at risk, to calls for complete legalization with provisions for public funding.

==Terminology==
Many of the terms used in the debate are seen as political framing: terms used to validate one&#x27;s stance while invalidating the opposition&#x27;s. For example, the labels &quot;pro-choice&quot; and &quot;pro-life&quot; imply widely held values such as liberty or the right to life, while suggesting that the opposition must be &quot;anti-choice&quot; or &quot;anti-life&quot;. Terms used in the debate to describe their opponents consist of &quot;pro-abortion&quot;, &quot;pro-abort&quot;; however, these terms do not always reflect a political view or fall along a binary. Seven in ten Americans described themselves as &quot;pro-choice&quot; while almost two-thirds described themselves as &quot;pro-life&quot;. Another identifier in the debate is &quot;abolitionist&quot;, which harks back to the 19th-century struggle against human slavery.

Appeals are often made in the abortion debate to the rights of the fetus, pregnant woman, or other parties. Such appeals can generate confusion if the &quot;type&quot; of rights is not specified (whether civil, natural, or otherwise) or if it is simply &quot;assumed&quot; that the right appealed to takes precedence over all other competing rights (an example of begging the question). The appropriate terms to designate the human organism before birth are also debated. Some anti-abortion supporters regard the technical terminology &quot;embryo&quot; and &quot;fetus&quot; as dehumanizing, whereas some abortion rights proponents regard ordinary terms such as &quot;baby&quot; or &quot;child&quot; as emotion-inducing.

The use of the term &quot;baby&quot; to describe the unborn human organism is seen by some scholars as part of an effort to assign the organism agency, functioning to further the construction of fetal personhood. Anti-abortion activists occasionally use the term &quot;the silent holocaust&quot; or &quot;the American genocide&quot; about the number of abortions that have been performed in the United States since 1973.

==Political debate==
There is abundant debate regarding the extent of abortion regulation by the government. Supporters of abortion rights may argue against the government regulation of abortions, and rather it be treated as routine medical practice. From a compromising perspective, both sides may support the permission of the government to prohibit elective abortions after the 20th week, viability, or the second . Religion has also played a role in the debate. For example, some Christian denominations and groups generally oppose abortion, believing it more aligns with their interpretation of the Bible, and because of this may support the prohibition of some or all abortions, starting from conception. Those who oppose abortion rights may argue against the procedures and nature of abortion. The two sides of the political debate represent the contentious moral principles in the “sanctity of life” versus “the woman&#x27;s right to choose.” Abortion debates differ from other public health issues due to complex ethical and legal considerations.

In popular culture, the American romantic drama dance film &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; (1987) was a clear and unapologetic argument for reproductive choice, called by abortion rights advocates the &quot;golden standard&quot; for cinematic portrayals of abortion.

== Debates in North America ==
=== United States ===
==== The &quot;Dobbs&quot; decision ====
As an example of political decisions concerning the abortion debate, in the years following the &quot;Dobbs&quot; ruling, state governments have been granted political authority over abortion access and resources. The issue-framing and policy-making aspects vary from each perspective and interest but ultimately form the strategic decisions for legislators for support or opposition to their efforts.

The &quot;Dobbs&quot; decision allows other debates to form over several different concepts in other state legislature concerning the terms &quot;privacy&quot; and &quot;liberty interests&quot; Which those cases have determined the foundation of clinician-patient relationships and private medical decisions. Abortion decisions bring focus onto other state efforts corresponding to abortion, such as limiting access to medication abortions, preventing third parties from assisting anyone seeking an abortion, or punishing women who end their pregnancies. While evaluating the &quot;Dobbs&quot; ruling, the Court had determined the importance of the opposing factors of &quot;respect for and preservation of prenatal life at all stages...; the protection of maternal health and safety; the elimination of particularly gruesome or barbaric medical procedures;... integrity of the medical profession; the mitigation of fetal pain, and the prevention of discrimination based on race, sex, or disability.&quot;

====Privacy====
In the United States, the debate has been framed as an aspect of privacy. Even though the right to privacy is not explicitly stated in many constitutions of sovereign nations, many people see it as foundational to a functioning democracy.

&quot;Time&quot; has stated that the issue of bodily privacy is &quot;the core&quot; of the abortion debate. &quot;Time&quot; defined privacy, concerning abortion, as the ability of a woman to &quot;decide what happens to her own body&quot;. In political terms, privacy can be understood as a condition in which one is not observed or disturbed by government.

Traditionally, American courts have located the right to privacy in the Fourth Amendment, Ninth Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, as well as the penumbra of the Bill of Rights. The landmark decision &quot;Roe v Wade&quot; relied on the 14th Amendment, which guarantees that federal rights shall be applied equally to all persons born in the United States. The 14th Amendment has given rise to the doctrine of Substantive due process, which is said to guarantee various privacy rights, including the right to bodily integrity.

While governments are allowed to invade the privacy of their citizens in some cases, they are expected to protect privacy in all cases lacking a compelling state interest. In the US, the compelling state interest test has been developed per the standards of strict scrutiny. In &quot;Roe v Wade&quot;, the Court decided that the state has an &quot;important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life&quot; from the point of viability on, but that before viability, the woman&#x27;s fundamental rights are more compelling than that of the state.

====Aftermath of U.S. judicial involvement====

&quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; struck down state laws banning abortion in 1973. Over 20 cases have addressed abortion law in the United States, all of which upheld &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. Since &quot;Roe&quot;, abortion has been legal throughout the country, but states have placed varying regulations on it, from requiring parental involvement in a minor&#x27;s abortion to restricting late-term abortions.

After the court ruling, controversies continued, sometimes passionately. Judith Blake, for example, even before the ruling, predicted a backlash in attitudes about abortion in &quot;Abortion and Public Opinion&quot; (1971). After the ruling, her research indicated a considerable discrepancy between the views of the Court and those of the public at large. Meanwhile, philosophers and theologians (including Roger Wertheimer and Edmund Pincoffs) debated questions such as whether there is any rational basis for deciding whether a zygote, embryo, or fetus must be considered to be a human being. 

Legal criticisms of the &quot;Roe&quot; decision address many points, among them are several suggesting that it is an overreach of judicial powers, or that it was not properly based on the Constitution, or that it is an example of judicial activism and that it should be overturned so that abortion law can be decided by legislatures. Justice Potter Stewart, who joined with the majority, viewed the &quot;Roe&quot; opinion as &quot;legislative&quot; and asked that more consideration be paid to state legislatures.

Candidates competing for the Democratic nomination for the 2008 presidential election cited &quot;Gonzales v. Carhart&quot; as judicial activism. In upholding the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, &quot;Carhart&quot; is the first judicial opinion upholding a legal barrier to a specific abortion procedure.


&quot;Dobbs v. Jackson&quot; overturned the &quot;Roe&quot; decision on 24 June 2022. This was a Supreme Court decision about Mississippi&#x27;s law stopping abortions after 14 weeks. 

Although there is a general presumption against a state&#x27;s ability to regulate extraterritorially (i.e., beyond its borders), legal authority suggests that the Constitution does not prohibit a state from regulating abortion travel.

===Canada===

With &quot;R v. Morgentaler&quot;, a 5–2 majority of the Supreme Court of Canada held that the abortion provisions of the Criminal Code were unconstitutional. The majority of the Court held that the abortion provisions infringed the rights of pregnant women, contrary to the security of the person clause of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and could not be justified. The only laws currently governing abortion in Canada are those that govern medical procedures in general, such as those regulating the licensing of facilities, the training of medical personnel, and the like. Laws also exist which are intended to prevent anti-abortion activists from interfering with staff and patient access to hospitals and clinics, for instance by creating buffer zones around them.

Because the courts did not establish abortion as a constitutional right, Parliament continues to have jurisdiction to legislate concerning abortion. The Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney twice attempted to do. The first bill, introduced in 1988, was defeated in the House of Commons. The next year, in 1989, the Mulroney government introduced a bill that would allow abortion only if two doctors certified that the woman&#x27;s health was in danger. This bill passed the House of Commons but was defeated by a tie vote in the Senate. There have not been any further government attempts to enact legislation relating to abortion in Parliament since then.

Although the courts have not ruled on the question of fetal personhood as a matter of constitutional law, the question has been raised in two cases, &quot;Tremblay v. Daigle&quot; and &quot;R. v. Sullivan&quot;. Both cases relied on the born alive rule, part of Canadian common law and Quebec civil law, to determine that the fetus was not a person by law.

Two further cases are notable: &quot;Dobson (Litigation Guardian of) v. Dobson&quot;, and &quot;Winnipeg Child &amp; Family Services (Northwest Area) v G.(D.F.)&quot;, which dismissed fetal abuse claims.

== Worldwide stances ==
=== Countries that refuse abortions ===

Abortion and contraception were completely banned in Romania from 1967-1989, due to Decree 770 under Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu. As a result, maternal mortality in Romania became the highest in Europe, and thousands of children ended up in orphanages raised in grievous conditions, leading to a rise in child mortality.

As of 2016, six countries completely outlaw abortion: El Salvador, Malta, Vatican City, the Dominican Republic, Philippines, and Nicaragua. This prohibits a woman from having an abortion for any reason (underage, fetal impairment, rape/incest), even if it might mean saving her life. Penalties include jail time. For example, in El Salvador, abortions are punishable with up to 50 years in prison.

=== Countries with strict laws ===
 Argentina allowed abortion only in case of rape or if the woman&#x27;s health was at risk. In December 2020, the Argentine Senate passed a bill to legalize abortion. Also in 2020, the Constitutional Tribunal ended almost all legal abortion in Poland. China has a free abortion policy but some studies show that its government also uses forced abortion to enforce strict limits on how many children each family can have. In the United States, there are increasing efforts to limit access to abortion by states in the wake of the 2022 reversal of Roe v Wade (1973) which allowed for a constitutional right to abortion.

===Effects of legalization/illegalization===
Abortion rights advocates argue that outlawing abortion increases the rate of unsafe abortions, as the availability of professional abortion services decreases, and leads to increased maternal mortality. According to a global study collaboratively conducted by the World Health Organization and the Guttmacher Institute, most unsafe abortions occur where abortion is illegal. Withholding access to safe abortions results in 30,000 abortion-related deaths per year. Women may also choose suicide when abortion is illegal.

The effect on crime of legalized abortion is a subject of controversy, with proponents of the theory generally arguing that &quot;unwanted children&quot; are more likely to become criminals and that an inverse correlation is observed between the availability of abortion and subsequent crime.

Economist George Akerlof has argued that the legalization of abortion in the United States contributed to a declining sense of paternal duty among biological fathers and to a decline in shotgun weddings, even when women chose childbirth over abortion, and thus to an increase rather than a decrease in the rate of children born to unwed mothers.

KFF conducted a nationally representative survey of office-based OBGYNs in the U.S. Since Dobbs, 42% of OBGYNs report that they are very or somewhat concerned about their own legal risk when making decisions about patient care and abortion. This could greatly affect how many OBGYNs will continue to practice.

==Personhood==

There are differences of opinion as to whether a zygote/embryo/fetus acquires &quot;personhood&quot; or was always a &quot;person&quot;. If &quot;personhood&quot; is acquired, opinions differ about when this happens.

Traditionally, the concept of personhood entailed the soul, a metaphysical concept referring to a non-corporeal or extra-corporeal dimension of human being. Today, the concepts of subjectivity and intersubjectivity, personhood, mind, and self have come to encompass several aspects of human beings previously considered the domain of the &quot;soul&quot;. Thus, while the historical question has been: when does the soul enter the body, in modern terms, the question could be put instead: at what point does the developing individual develop personhood or selfhood?

Since human development occurs continuously, identifying a precise time when a human being becomes a person could lead to an instance of the Sorites paradox (also known as &quot;the paradox of the heap&quot;).

Related issues attached to the question of the beginning of human personhood include the legal status, and subjectivity of the pregnant woman and the philosophical concept of &quot;natality&quot; (i.e. &quot;the distinctively human capacity to initiate a new beginning&quot;, which a new human life embodies).

In the 1973 US judgment &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, the opinion of the justices included the following statement:
===Fetal pain===
A 2005 multidisciplinary systematic review in &quot;JAMA&quot; in the area of fetal development found that a fetus is unlikely to feel pain until after the sixth month of pregnancy. Developmental neurobiologists suspect that the establishment of thalamocortical connections (at about 26 weeks) may be critical to fetal perception of pain. However, legislation was proposed by anti-abortion advocates that would require abortion providers to tell a woman that the fetus may feel pain during an abortion procedure if the woman&#x27;s proposed abortion was at least 20 weeks after fertilization.

The &quot;JAMA&quot; review concluded that data from dozens of medical reports and studies indicate that fetuses are unlikely to feel pain until the third trimester of pregnancy. However several medical critics have since disputed these conclusions. Other researchers such as Anand and Fisk have challenged the idea that pain cannot be felt before 26 weeks, positing instead that pain can be felt at around 20 weeks. Anand&#x27;s suggestion is disputed in a March 2010 report on fetal awareness published by a working party of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), citing a lack of evidence or rationale. Page 20 of the report definitively states that the fetus cannot feel pain before week 24. Because pain can involve sensory, emotional and cognitive factors, leaving it &quot;impossible to know&quot; when painful experiences are perceived, even if it is known when thalamocortical connections are established. In December 2022, the RCOG conducted a review of the existing literature surrounding fetal pain awareness, and concluded, &quot;To date, evidence indicates that the possibility of pain perception before 28 weeks of gestation is unlikely.&quot;

Wendy Savage—former press officer, Doctors for a Woman&#x27;s Choice on Abortion—considered the question to be irrelevant. In a 1997 letter to the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;, she noted that the majority of surgical abortions in Britain were performed under general anesthesia which affects the fetus, and considers the discussion &quot;to be unhelpful to women and to the scientific debate&quot;. Others caution against the unnecessary use of fetal anesthetic during abortion, as it poses potential health risks to the pregnant woman. David Mellor and colleagues have noted that the fetal brain is already awash in naturally occurring chemicals that keep it sedated and anesthetized until birth. At least one anesthesia researcher has suggested the fetal pain legislation may make abortions harder to obtain because abortion clinics lack the equipment and expertise to supply fetal anesthesia. Anesthesia is administered directly to fetuses only while they are undergoing surgery.

===Fetal personhood debate===

Although the two main sides of the abortion debate tend to agree that a human fetus is biologically and genetically human (that is, of the human species), they often differ in their view on whether or not a human fetus is, in any of various ways, a &quot;person&quot;. Anti-abortion supporters argue that abortion is morally wrong on the basis that a fetus is an innocent human person or because a fetus is a potential life that will, in most cases, develop into a fully functional human being. They believe that a fetus is a person upon conception. Others reject this position by distinguishing between &quot;human being&quot; and &quot;human person&quot;, arguing that while the fetus is &quot;innocent&quot; and &quot;biologically human&quot;, it is not a &quot;person&quot; with a &quot;right to life&quot;. In support of this distinction, some propose a list of criteria as markers of personhood. For example, Mary Ann Warren suggests consciousness (at least the capacity to feel pain), reasoning, self-motivation, the ability to communicate, and self-awareness. According to Warren, a being need not exhibit all of these criteria to qualify as a person with a right to life, but if a being exhibits &quot;none&quot; of them (or perhaps only one), then it is certainly not a person. Warren concludes that as the fetus satisfies only one criterion, consciousness (and this only after it becomes susceptible to pain), the fetus is not a person and abortion is therefore morally permissible. Other philosophers apply similar criteria, concluding that a fetus lacks a right to life because it lacks brain waves or higher brain function, self-consciousness, rationality, and autonomy. These lists diverge over precisely features confer a right to life, but tend to propose various psychological or physiological features not found in fetuses.

Critics of this typically argue that some of the proposed criteria for personhood would disqualify two classes of &quot;born&quot; human beings – reversibly comatose patients, and human infants – from having a right to life, since they, like fetuses, are not self-conscious, do not communicate, and so on. Defenders of the proposed criteria may respond that the reversibly comatose &quot;do&quot; satisfy the relevant criteria because they &quot;retain all their &quot;unconscious&quot; mental states&quot;. or at least some higher brain function (brain waves). Warren concedes that infants are not &quot;persons&quot; by her proposed criteria, and on that basis, she and others, including the moral philosopher Peter Singer, conclude that infanticide could be morally acceptable under some circumstances (for example if the infant is severely disabled or to save the lives of several other infants).

An alternative approach is to base personhood or the right to life on a being&#x27;s &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;inherent&quot; capacities. On this approach, a being essentially has a right to life if it has a &quot;natural capacity&quot; to develop the relevant psychological features; and, since human beings do have this natural capacity, they essentially have a right to life beginning at conception (or whenever they come into existence). Critics of this position argue that mere genetic potential is not a plausible basis for respect (or for the right to life), and that basing a right to life on natural capacities would lead to the counterintuitive position that anencephalic infants, irreversibly comatose patients, and brain-dead patients kept alive on a medical ventilator, are all persons with a right to life. Respondents to this criticism argue that the noted human cases in fact would not be classified as persons as they do not have a natural capacity to develop any psychological features. Also, in a view that favors benefiting even unconceived but potential future persons, it has been argued as justified to abort an unintended pregnancy in favor for conceiving a new child later in better conditions.
Philosophers such as Aquinas use the concept of individuation. They argue that abortion is not permissible from the point at which individual human identity is realized. Anthony Kenny argues that this can be derived from everyday beliefs and language and one can legitimately say &quot;if my mother had had an abortion six months into her pregnancy, she would have killed me&quot; then one can reasonably infer that at six months the &quot;me&quot; in question would have been an existing person with a valid claim to life. Since division of the zygote into twins through the process of monozygotic twinning can occur until the fourteenth day of pregnancy, Kenny argues that individual identity is obtained at this point and thus abortion is not permissible after two weeks.

===Arguments for abortion rights that do not depend on fetal non-personhood===

====Bodily rights====
An argument first presented by Judith Jarvis Thomson in her 1971 paper &quot;A Defense of Abortion&quot; states that the fetus is a person and has a right to life, abortion is morally permissible because a woman has a right to control her own body and its life-support functions (i.e. the right to life does not include the right to be kept alive by another person&#x27;s body). Thomson&#x27;s variant of this argument draws an analogy between forcing a woman to continue an unwanted pregnancy and forcing a person to allow his body to be used to maintain blood homeostasis (as a dialysis machine is used) for another person with kidney failure. It is argued that just as it would be permissible to &quot;unplug&quot; and thereby cause the death of the person who is using one&#x27;s kidneys, so it is permissible to abort the fetus (who similarly, it is said, has no right to use one&#x27;s body&#x27;s life-support functions against one&#x27;s will).

Critics of this argument generally argue that there are morally relevant disanalogies between abortion and the kidney failure scenario. For example, it is argued that the fetus is the woman&#x27;s child as opposed to a mere stranger; that abortion &quot;kills&quot; the fetus rather than merely letting it die; and that in the case of pregnancy arising from voluntary intercourse, the woman has either tacitly consented to the fetus using her body, or has to allow it to use her body since she is responsible for its need to use her body. Some writers defend the analogy against these objections, arguing that the disanalogies are morally irrelevant or do not apply to abortion in the way critics have claimed.

Alternative scenarios have been put forth as more accurate and realistic representations of the moral issues present in abortion. John Noonan proposes the scenario of a family who was found to be liable for frostbite finger loss suffered by a dinner guest whom they refused to allow to stay overnight, although it was very cold outside and the guest showed signs of being sick. Noonan argues that just as it would not be permissible to refuse temporary accommodation for the guest to protect him from physical harm, it would not be permissible to refuse temporary accommodation for a fetus.

Other critics claim that there is a difference between artificial and extraordinary means of preservation, such as medical treatment, kidney dialysis, and blood transfusions, and normal and natural means of preservation, such as gestation, childbirth, and breastfeeding. They argue that if a baby was born into an environment in which there was no replacement available for her mother&#x27;s breast milk, and the baby would either breastfeed or starve, the mother would have to allow the baby to breastfeed. But the mother would never have to give the baby a blood transfusion, no matter what the circumstances were. The difference between breastfeeding in that scenario and blood transfusions is the difference between using one&#x27;s body as a kidney dialysis machine, and gestation and childbirth.

====Freedom and equality====
Margaret Sanger wrote: &quot;No woman can call herself free until she can choose consciously whether she will or will not be a mother.&quot; From this perspective, the right to abortion can be construed to be necessary for women to achieve equality with men whose freedom is not nearly so restricted by having children.

Although freedom and equality are subjective or based on one&#x27;s perspectives in some contexts regarding politics, reproductive rights in policy are classified as fundamental freedoms for multiple reasons. Several reasons include but are not limited to the necessary proper analysis of public interests and policy, legislative violations when criminalizing abortion, utilizing humanitarian efforts, equality of resources and medical access, etc.

The regulation of the population&#x27;s fundamental rights disregards several policy-making purposes: assessing the burdens, opportunity costs, and unintended consequences of public policies. Prioritization of such assessments benefits the essential understanding of trends regarding abortion rates and depicts an accurate evaluation of the status of women&#x27;s reproductive freedoms and equality overall. The right to abortion is consequently determined by referring to either the policy method of life versus choice.

==== Impacts of criminalization ====
Some activists and academics, such as Andrea Smith, argue that the criminalization of abortion furthers the marginalization of oppressed groups such as poor women and women of color. Sending these women into the prison system would do nothing to address the social/political/economic problems that marginalize these women or, sometimes, cause them to require abortions.

Some argue that race and sex-based abortions being prohibited further marginalizes oppressed groups by criminalizing those aspects of abortions. The Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglas Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act, proposed in Arizona in 2011, prohibited race and sex-based abortions and allowed punishment for those who perform abortions based on that criteria. The bill characterized sex-based abortions as sex-based infanticide, and abortions based on the race of the fetus, or the race of the parent of the fetus, were seen as a practice that reinforces aspects of racial discrimination. Laws like these can be seen as heightening the racialization of certain issues surrounding abortion.

According to the WHO, criminalization can have a major negative impact on &quot;the provision of quality care&quot; by preventing medical personnel from acting out of fear of retaliation or punishment. The 2022 LTP Evaluation found that doctors were unwilling to conduct late abortions even when the legislation allowed them, preferring to refer pregnant women to clinics abroad out of anxiety for the possibility of exposing themselves to criminal culpability.

This worry even extends to an unfounded fear of being prosecuted for sending their patient to a clinic in a different country where late abortion is permitted.

The criminalization of abortion in certain states has forced women to cross state lines for abortion care. It was found that women living in states with more hostile abortion laws were traveling out of state for abortion care in greater percentages than women living in states with protected abortion access. This also brought about the term &quot;abortion deserts&quot;, which are locations or counties that have no abortion facilities.

People traveling interstate for abortions decrease their home state&#x27;s abortion rates, but it increases the percentages of women who will need to travel across state lines to get access to abortion care. The travel also comes with other costs, such as transportation, insurance costs, missing work, childcare, etc. that impact the people who need this abortion care. These burdens tend to disproportionately affect people of color and impoverished people in need of reproductive healthcare.

Abortion criminalization also affects abortion providers by placing strict regulations and requirements on the providers. Targeted Regulation of Abortion Provider laws (TRAP laws) are state laws that impose annual licensing fees, personnel or facility mandates, etc. on facilities that want to continue to be abortion providers; these regulations are not imposed on other similar clinics or facilities. Some criticize these laws as excessive, with many of the regulations seeming excessive. Some states have requirements for room sizes and ceiling heights, room temperatures, procedure supervision, etc. that may make it harder for facilities to acquire licensure or hard for physicians to perform the procedure.

==== Inefficacy of abortion bans on reducing abortion ====
Research has been conducted exploring whether banning abortion reduces abortion rates. Researchers from the Guttmacher Institute, the World Health Organization, and the University of Massachusetts concluded that, in countries where abortions were restricted, the number of unintended pregnancies increased. The following table taken from their research shows these findings in greater detail:

Table: Rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion, and proportion of unintended pregnancies ending in abortion, by legal status of abortion for years 2015–19

UI = uncertainty interval.

====Abortion safety====

Even where abortions are illegal, they continue to take place, however, they are generally done unsafely, both because the need for secrecy tends to be more important than the woman&#x27;s safety, and due to the lack of training and experience the person performing the abortion. When done correctly by properly trained doctors, abortion is generally safe. Where laws restrict abortion rights, abortions are less safe and result in the deaths of 30,000 women each year.

====Population planning====

It has been suggested that access to abortion can help reduce human overpopulation, which is shown to be harmful to the natural environment.

===Arguments against abortion===

====Discrimination====
The book &quot;Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation&quot; (1983) presented the argument that abortion involves unjust discrimination against the unborn. According to this argument, those who deny that fetuses have a right to life do not value human life, but instead, select arbitrary characteristics (such as particular levels of physical or psychological development) as giving some human beings more value or rights than others.

In contrast, philosophers who define the right to life by reference to particular levels of physical or psychological development typically maintain that such characteristics are morally relevant, and reject the assumption that all human life necessarily has value (or that membership in the species &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; is in itself morally relevant).

Some abortion opponents have argued for, and promoted legislation for, a ban on the abortion of fetuses that have been diagnosed with Down syndrome on the basis that such abortions unfairly discriminate against disabled people. Critics of these measures charge that they are hypocritical since many of their proponents appear to be unconcerned with addressing the needs of living disabled persons. In response to one such proposed measure in North Carolina, a spokesperson for Disability Rights North Carolina commented, &quot;We would never think of using limits on someone&#x27;s bodily autonomy to protect our rights.&quot;

====Deprivation====
The argument of deprivation states that abortion is morally wrong because it deprives the fetus of a valuable future. On this account, killing an adult human being is wrong because it deprives the victim of a &quot;future like ours&quot;—a future containing highly valuable or desirable experiences, activities, projects, and enjoyments. If a being has such a future, then killing that being would seriously harm the fetus and hence would be seriously wrong. According to the argument, since a fetus does have such a future, the &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; of deliberate abortions are placed in the &quot;same moral category&quot; as killing an innocent adult human being. Not all abortions are unjustified according to this argument; abortion would be justified if the same justification could be applied to killing an adult human.

Criticism of this line of reasoning follows several threads. Some reject the argument on grounds relating to personal identity, holding that the fetus is &quot;not the same entity&quot; as the adult into which it will develop, and thus that the fetus does not have a &quot;future like ours&quot; in the required sense. Others grant that the fetus has a &quot;future like ours&quot; but argue that being deprived of this future is not significant harm or a significant wrong to the fetus because there are relatively few &quot;psychological connections&quot; (continuations of memory, belief, desire, and the like) between the fetus as it is now and the adult into which it will develop. Another criticism is that the argument creates inequalities in the wrongness of killing; as the futures of some people appear to be far more valuable or desirable than the futures of other people, the argument appears to entail that some killings are far more wrong than others, or that some people have a far stronger right to life than others—a conclusion that is taken to be counterintuitive or unacceptable.

====Argument from uncertainty====
Some anti-abortion supporters argue that if there is uncertainty as to whether the fetus has a right to life, then having an abortion is equivalent to consciously taking the risk of killing another. According to this argument, if it is not known for certain whether something (such as the fetus) has a right to life, then it is reckless and morally wrong to treat that thing as if it &quot;lacks&quot; a right to life (for example by killing it). This would place abortion in the same moral category as manslaughter (if it turns out that the fetus has a right to life) or certain forms of criminal negligence (if it turns out that the fetus does not have a right to life).

David Boonin replies that if this kind of argument were correct, then the killing of nonhuman animals and plants would also be morally wrong because Boonin contends it is not known for certain that such beings lack a right to life. Boonin also argues that arguments from uncertainty fail because the mere fact that one might be mistaken in finding certain arguments persuasive (for example, arguments for the claim that the fetus lacks a right to life) does not mean that one should act contrary to those arguments or assume them to be mistaken.

====Slippery slope ====

A primary slippery slope argument used against the practice of abortion claims that the continuity of human life from conception onward requires that we do not arbitrarily deny life prior to any particular developmental milestone. For otherwise, it would be a slippery slope to the denial of adult human being&#x27;s right to life because there would only be an arbitrary difference between the two cases. Thus the argument concludes that the only non-arbitrary and fair point at which to distinguish when human life has a stringent right to life and when it does not is at conception.

Another argument used by anti-abortion activists is the slippery slope argument, that normalizing abortion may lead to the normalization of other practices such as euthanasia.

==== Mental health ====

Some anti-abortion activists argue that having an abortion can cause long-term harm to a woman&#x27;s emotional and physical health.

====Religious beliefs====

Views from different religions can often be in direct opposition to each other. Muslims typically cite the Quranic verse 17:31 which states that a fetus should not be aborted out of fear of poverty. Christians who oppose abortion support their views with Scripture references such as that of Luke 1:15; Jeremiah 1:4–5; Genesis 25:21–23; Matthew 1:18; and Psalm 139:13–16. The Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodox Churches, constituting approximately 70% of Christians worldwide, believe that human life begins at conception, as does the right to life; thus, abortion is considered immoral. Most Evangelical Christians also consider abortion to be immoral. The Church of England also considers abortion to be morally wrong, though their position admits abortion when &quot;the continuance of a pregnancy threatens the life of the mother&quot;.

==== Feminist arguments ====
Some feminists have argued that abortion does not liberate women, but gives society an excuse to not allow women who are mothers to access financial and social services that would benefit them more, such as better access to childcare, workplaces acknowledging the needs of mothers, and state support to help women reintegrate into the workplace. Further, they argue that if women did not have easy access to abortions, governments would be forced to invest more money into supporting mothers.

Other feminists oppose abortion because it distracts from other women&#x27;s issues. Writer Megan Clancy argued that:

Some feminists have argued that abortion is inconsistent with feminist principles of justice and opposition to discrimination and violence. Feminists for Life, an anti-abortion feminist organization, argued that:

Some feminists see abortion as an excuse for men to not take responsibility for sexually exploiting women because abortion prevents men from having to take care of any children the woman has as a result of the sexual intercourse.

===Other factors===

====Mexico City policy====

The Mexico City policy is a U.S. federal government policy requiring any non-governmental organization that is based outside the U.S. and receives U.S. government funding to refrain from performing or promoting abortion services. It is known by critics as the &quot;global gag rule&quot;. Kelly Lifchez and Beatriz Maldonado cite studies showing that &quot;the policy results in higher abortion rates, more unwanted births, higher maternal mortality, worse health status for unwanted children, and substantial reductions in the provision of family planning services in countries that rely on U.S. funding for family planning.&quot; The Mexico City policy was instituted under President Reagan, suspended under President Clinton, reinstated by President George W. Bush, suspended again by President Barack Obama on 24 January 2009 and re-instated once again by President Donald Trump on 23 January 2017. In 2021, President Biden rescinded the Mexico City policy.

====Public opinion====
A number of opinion polls around the world have explored public opinion regarding the issue of abortion. Results have varied from poll to poll, country to country, and region to region, while varying with regard to different aspects of the issue.

In North America, a December 2001 poll surveyed Canadian opinion on abortion, asking in what circumstances they believe abortion should be permitted; 32% responded that they believe abortion should be legal in all circumstances, 52% that it should be legal in certain circumstances, and 14% that it should be legal in no circumstances. A similar poll in April 2009 surveyed people in the United States about U.S. opinion on abortion; 18% said that abortion should be &quot;legal in all cases&quot;, 28% said that abortion should be &quot;legal in most cases&quot;, 28% said abortion should be &quot;illegal in most cases&quot; and 16% said abortion should be &quot;illegal in all cases&quot;. A November 2005 poll in Mexico found that 73.4% think abortion should not be legalized while 11.2% think it should be.

A May 2005 survey examined attitudes toward abortion in 10 European countries, asking respondents whether they agreed with the statement, &quot;If a woman doesn&#x27;t want children, she should be allowed to have an abortion&quot;. The highest level of approval was 81% (in the Czech Republic); the lowest was 47% (in Poland). In 2019, 58% of Poles supported abortion on request up to the 12th week of pregnancy.

A 2021 study showed that abortion providers faced discrimination and termination in the workplace, death threats, harassment, and impacts to their private and personal lives for them and their families. The same study shows that the providers continue to work in the field due to their commitment to women&#x27;s health and pro-choice cause.

As of 2022, after the overturn of &quot;Roe vs Wade&quot; by the Supreme Court, a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; poll conducted in March showed that 60% of voters believed that abortion should be legal in most cases, an increase of 5% earlier in the year. 29% of participates believed it should be illegal in most cases, except for endangerment of the woman, rape, or incest. Lastly, 6% said it should be illegal in all cases, down from 11% earlier that same year. A 2024 Pew Research Center poll reported 63% of Americans believed abortion should be legal in all or most cases. The poll found that the share of Americans living in states with abortion bans or restrictions who believe abortions should be easier to access has increased by 12%. This poll found little difference based on gender (61% of men generally supportive vs 64% of women) with education and especially religious affiliation being better predictive factors. It also shows that younger people tend to be more positive towards abortion with the 50-64 group being the most negative.

African countries have different views based on region and cultural influences. In Kenya, both male and female opinions show that abortion is frowned upon, due to embedded social norms that stem from religious and cultural beliefs. While younger generations are starting to normalize abortions, limited access to procedure, high costs, and lack of information still leads to unsafe abortion practices. In Nigeria, the abortion laws are even stricter. Rather than being ostracized by the community, abortion in Nigeria can lead to life imprisonment for both the abortion seekers and those who assist them. The country&#x27;s government has outlawed abortion in all cases except to save the life of the pregnant person. In a survey of women, many cited religion, incomplete abortion, future infertility, and death as a fear when seeking abortion in Nigeria.

Of attitudes in South America, a December 2003 survey found that 30% of Argentines thought that abortion in Argentina should be allowed &quot;regardless of situation&quot;, 47% that it should be allowed &quot;under some circumstances&quot;, and 23% that it should not be allowed &quot;regardless of situation&quot;. A subsequent poll suggested that 45% of Argentinians are in favor of abortion for any reason in the first twelve weeks. This same poll conducted in September 2011 also suggests that most Argentinians favor abortion being legal when a woman&#x27;s health or life is at risk (81%), when the pregnancy is a result of rape (80%) or the fetus has severe abnormalities (68%). A March 2007 poll regarding the abortion law in Brazil found that 65% of Brazilians believe that it &quot;should not be modified&quot;, 16% that it should be expanded &quot;to allow abortion in other cases&quot;, 10% that abortion should be &quot;decriminalized&quot;, and 5% were &quot;not sure&quot;. Later a poll made in September 2022 found that the 70% of Brazilians where against abortions, 20% where in favor of it, 8% where neither in favor or against it, and 2% didn&#x27;t know what to answer. A July 2005 poll in Colombia found that 65.6% said they thought that abortion should remain illegal, 26.9% that it should be made legal, and 7.5% that they were unsure.

The attitudes in Asia vary. More secular parts of Asia such as Japan and Taiwan are more likely to favor abortion, and more religious parts such as Pakistan and Indonesia are more likely to oppose abortion. Other countries, such as China, are in between but still slightly favoring abortion. A worldwide survey conducted in 2022 reported that 14% of Chinese thought that abortion in China should be &quot;legal in all cases&quot;, 34% that it should be &quot;legal in most cases&quot;, 20% that it should be &quot;illegal in most cases&quot;, and 13% that it should be &quot;illegal in all cases&quot;, with 20% that did not respond. The same survey reported that 17% of Japanese thought that abortion in Japan should be &quot;legal in all cases&quot;, 32% that it should be &quot;legal in most cases&quot;, only 7% that it should be &quot;illegal in most cases&quot;, and a very small minority of 2% that it should be &quot;illegal in all cases&quot;, with an overwhelming 43% that did not respond. The survey also reported that 14% of Malaysians thought that abortion in Malaysia should be &quot;legal in all cases&quot;, 18% that it should be &quot;legal in most cases&quot;, 25% that it should be &quot;illegal in most cases&quot;, and 20% that it should be &quot;illegal in all cases&quot;, with 23% that did not respond, amounting to almost half the population with a negative view of abortion.

According to global surveys in 2023 and 2024, the right to access legal abortion is widely supported. There is particularly strong widespread support for legal abortion in Europe.

More than one in two (56%) across 29 countries believe abortion should be legal, including more than one in four (27%) who feel it should be legal in all cases. Support for abortion is highest in Europe, with Sweden and France having the highest level of sentiment in believing abortion should be legal (87% and 82% respectively). Support is lowest in Asia, with Indonesia and Malaysia the only countries where less than one in three think abortion should be legal (22% and 29% respectively).

====Effect upon crime rate====
A theory attempts to draw a correlation between the United States&#x27; unprecedented nationwide decline of the overall crime rate during the 1990s and the decriminalization of abortion 20 years prior.

The suggestion was brought to widespread attention by a 1999 academic paper, &quot;The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime&quot;, authored by the economists Steven D. Levitt and John Donohue. They attributed the drop in crime to a reduction in individuals said to have a higher statistical probability of committing crimes: unwanted children, especially those born to mothers who are African American, impoverished, adolescent, uneducated, and single. The change coincided with what would have been the adolescence, or peak years of potential criminality, of those who had not been born as a result of &quot;Roe v Wade&quot; and similar cases. Donohue and Levitt&#x27;s study also noted that states which legalized abortion before the rest of the nation experienced the lowering crime rate pattern earlier, and those with higher abortion rates had more pronounced reductions.

Fellow economists Christopher Foote and Christopher Goetz criticized the methodology in the Donohue-Levitt study, noting a lack of accommodation for statewide yearly variations such as cocaine use, and recalculating based on incidence of crime per capita; they found no statistically significant results. Levitt and Donohue responded to this by presenting an adjusted data set which took into account these concerns and reported that the data maintained the statistical significance of their initial paper.

Such research has been criticized by some as being utilitarian, discriminatory as to race and socioeconomic class, and as promoting eugenics as a solution to crime. Levitt states in his book &quot;Freakonomics&quot; that they are neither promoting nor negating any course of action—merely reporting data as economists.

====Breast cancer hypothesis====

The abortion–breast cancer hypothesis posits that induced abortion may increase the risk of developing breast cancer. This 1980&#x27;s paper actually contrasts with other scientific data that abortion is not related causality with breast cancer occurrence.

The hypothesis suggests that during early pregnancy, levels of estrogen increase, leading to breast growth in preparation for lactation, and if this process is interrupted by an abortion – before full maturity in the third trimester – then more relatively vulnerable immature cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer. The hypothesis mechanism was explored in rat studies conducted in the 1980s, from the same lab, so it lacks any scientific validation.

==== Minors ====

Many states require an unmarried minor to have parental consent or notification before an abortion is allowed to happen. These are known as parental involvement laws. The parents or guardians of the pregnant person must be consulted before an abortion is to be induced legally. States with these laws generally have different degrees of involvement and enforcement. A judge can be consulted to overrule a parent in the event the pregnant person is denied abortion services.

Studies have shown that these the required notification laws have not affected the probability that teenagers will engage in sexual activity or the demand for abortion. The rate of abortions for minors decreases in states with parental involvement laws by nearly 13 to 22 percent, however, it raises the rate for out-of-state abortions such in the case of Mississippi and Missouri.

Teenagers are shown to seek abortion across state lines to areas with less restrictive abortion laws to bypass these preventative methods. In the United States, 37 states require the parent to have knowledge while only 21 of those states need one parent to consent. Certain states have an alternative answer to the involvement of the parent by getting the judicial system involved with a judicial bypass. In those states, minors can get permission from the judge if parents are not willing to do so or if they are absent from their lives.

There are different guidelines for minors and abortions in every country. In most of Europe, all persons that are capable of judgment enjoy medical privacy and can decide medical matters on their own. The capability of judgment does not come at a defined age, however, and is dependent on how well the person is able to understand the decision and its consequences. For most medical procedures, the capability of judgment usually sets in at ages 12 to 14.

Parental involvement is one of the most common methods of restricting abortion, along with Medicaid funding restrictions, mandatory delay laws, licensing fees for abortion providers, and mandatory counseling laws.

Economist Marshall Medoff has argued that parental involvement laws are largely ineffective at reducing abortion demands. One cause could be that some states do not require parental involvement, so out-of-state abortions could meet the demands.

<text>The New World quail are small birds, that despite their similar appearance and habits to the Old World quail, belong to a different family known as the Odontophoridae. In contrast, the Old World quail are in the Phasianidae family, sharing only a remote phylogenetic connection with their New World counterparts through their mutual classification within the Phasianoidea superfamily. The geographical range of the New World quail extends from Canada to southern Brazil, and two species, the California quail and the bobwhite quail, have been successfully introduced to New Zealand. The stone partridge and Nahan&#x27;s partridge, both found in Africa, seem to belong to the family. Species are found across a variety of habitats from tropical rainforest to deserts, although few species are capable of surviving at very low temperatures. There are 34 species divided into 10 genera.

The legs of most New World quails are short but powerful, with some species having very thick legs for digging. They lack the spurs of many Old World galliformes. Although they are capable of short bursts of strong flight, New World quails prefer to walk, and run from danger (or hide), taking off explosively only as a last resort. Plumage varies from dull to spectacular, and many species have ornamental crests or plumes on their heads. Moderate sexual dichromism is seen in plumage, with males having brighter plumage.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The New World quails are shy diurnal birds and generally live on the ground; even the tree quails, which roost in high trees, generally feed mainly on the ground. They are generalists with regards to their diet, taking insects, seeds, vegetation, and tubers. Desert species in particular consume seeds frequently.

Most of the information about the breeding biology of New World quails comes from North American species, which have been better studied than those of the Neotropics. The family is generally thought to be monogamous, and nests are constructed on the ground. Clutch sizes are large, as is typical within the Galliformes, ranging from three to six eggs for the tree quail and wood quail, and as high as 10–15 for the northern bobwhite. Incubation takes between 16 and 30 days depending on the species. Chicks are precocial and quickly leave the nest to accompany the parents in large family groups.

Northern bobwhite and California quail are popular gamebirds, with many taken by hunters, but these species have also had their ranges increased to meet hunting demand and are not threatened. They are also artificially stocked. Some species are threatened by human activity, such as the bearded tree quail of Mexico, which is threatened by habitat loss and illegal hunting.

Though &quot;Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot; by Adam of Bremen considers Hemming and Gudfred to be &quot;patruelis&quot;, paternal cousins. Gudfred had several sons who served as co-rulers of the Danes. However, they are typically called &quot;sons of Gudfred&quot; without mention of their names or personal histories. The sole exception was Horik I who seems to have survived his siblings and was sole ruler by 827. They can all be considered paternal cousins of Hemming.

Another nephew of Gudfred, Reginold, is mentioned in the Royal Frankish Annals. He is also identified as son to an unnamed brother of Gudfred. He could be a sibling to Hemming. Assuming Gudfred had more than one sibling, Hemming and Reginold could also be paternal first cousins. Reginold appears in an 808 entry detailing a campaign of Gudfred against the Obotrites. Gudfred reportedly &quot;made two-thirds of the Obodrites tributary. But he lost the best and most battle-tested of his soldiers. With them he lost Reginold, his brother&#x27;s son, who was killed at the siege of a town along with a great number of Danish nobles.&quot;

Hemming had two siblings identified in the Annals, Hankwin and Angandeo. Sigifrid, one of his two rival successors on the throne, is also mentioned as a nephew of Gudfred. He could also be either a sibling or cousin to Hemming. Less clear is the relation of Hemming to the other rival successor, Anulo, and to the siblings of Anulo. Adam of Bremen considered Sigifrid and Anulo to be members of the same family, identifying both as nephews of Gudfred. The relation does not appear in the Royal Annals. However, there is an obscure phrase of the Annals which could support the relation. &quot;Anulo, the nephew of Heriold and of the former king&quot;. The vague Latin phrase &quot;Herioldi, et ipsius regis&quot; has been translated variously as &quot;Harald, and the king himself&quot; and &quot;Harald, previous king&quot;. 

Various attempts have been made to harmonize these kings from the Frankish annals with the legendary kings found in the accounts of traditional historians such as Saxo Grammaticus and the sagas. &quot;History of the Northmen, or Danes and Normans, from the earliest times to the Conquest&quot; (1831) by Henry Wheaton suggested that Hemming was a direct descendant of Ragnar Lodbrok, equating Sigefrid of the annals with Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye, the traditional son of Lothbrok, while making successor Gudfrid Sigurd&#x27;s brother. An alternative reconstruction would make Gudfred identical to the Gudröd of Ynglingatal, semi-legendary king of Vestfold and himself son of Halfdan the Mild, who would then be the grandfather of Hemming. Other scholars reject these identifications and the legends to which they attempt to link, only crediting the annals as representing authentic history.

==Reign==

The &quot;Royal Frankish Annals&quot; recorded the brief reign of Hemming. In 810, Charlemagne and Gudfred were in conflict. Gudfred had invaded Frisia and imposed tribute on its local population. He had then returned to Denmark. Charlemagne was preparing a retaliation campaign, gathering troops in the area of the Rhine. He led the assembled troops in the area where the Aller flows into the Weser River. There news reached him that Gudfred had died. &quot;The fleet which ravaged Frisia had returned home and King Godofrid had been murdered by one of his retainers&quot;. Charlemagne called off the campaign.

The last entry for year 810 mentions &quot;After the death of Godofrid, king of the Danes, Hemming, the son of his brother, succeeded to his throne and made peace with the emperor.&quot; The entries for 811 include detailed accounts of the negotiations between Hemming and Charlemagne. &quot;The peace announced between the emperor and Hemming, the king of the Danes, was only sworn on arms because of the severity of the winter, which closed the road for traveling between the parties. Only with the return of spring and the opening of the roads, which had been closed because of harsh frost, did twelve magnates of each party and people, that is of Franks and Danes, meet on the River Eider at Heiligen and confirm the peace by an exchange of oaths according to their customs.&quot;

&quot;The nobles of the Frankish side were Count Walach, son of Bernard, Count Burchard, Count Unroch, Count Odo, Count Meginhard, Count Bernard, Count Egbert, Count Theothari, Count Abo, Count Osdag, and Count Wigman. On the Danish side there were Hankwin and Angandeo, Hemming&#x27;s brothers, and in addition, other men distinguished among this people: Osfrid nicknamed Turdimulo, Warstein, Suomi, Urm, another Osfrid, son of Heiligen, and Osfrid of Schonen, and Hebbi and Aowin.

New envoys of Hemming are reported meeting Charlemagne in Aachen during November, 811. &quot;About the middle of November he [Charlemagne] came to Aachen. The envoys of King Hemming, Aowin and Hebbi, came to meet him and brought presents and assurances of peace.&quot; The entries in 811 end by mentioning the death of Charles the Younger (4 December 811) and Charlemagne wintering in Aachen. The entries in 812 begin with mention of the situation in Denmark. &quot;Not much later the news arrived that Hemming, king of the Danes had died. Sigifrid, the nephew of King Godofrid, and Anulo, the nephew of Heriold and of the former king, both wished to succeed him. Being unable to agree on who should be king, they raised troops, fought a battle, and were both killed. The party of Anulo won, however, and made his brothers Heriold and Reginfrid their kings. The defeated party out of necessity had to go along with Anulo&#x27;s party and did not reject the brothers as their kings. They say that ten thousand nine hundred and forty men died in that battle.&quot; Heriold, usually translated Harald, this man was Harald Klak.

The &quot;Annales Fuldenses&quot; give an almost identical account of this reign. This is not surprising as the entries of the &quot;Annales Fuldenses&quot; from 714 to the 830s were adopting material from earlier sources, including the Royal Frankish Annals. Hemming also appears in an 810 entry of the &quot;Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot; by Adam of Bremen. &quot;After their king Gudfred (Latin: Gotafridus) had subjected the Frisians and likewise the Nordalbingians, the Abodrites, and other Slavic peoples to tribute, he threatened even Charles with war. This strife very seriously retarded the emperor&#x27;s purpose with respect to Hamburg. When at length, by the dispensation of Heaven, Gudfred died, Hemming, his cousin, succeeded and soon made peace with the emperor, accepting the Eider River as the boundary of the kingdom.&quot; The term used in Latin was &quot;patruelis&quot; which would mean a paternal cousin.

<doc id="256038" wikidata="Q4134457" url="?curid=256038" title="Substance-related disorder">
<text>Substance-related disorders, also known as substance use disorders, are a type of mental disorder that affects a person&#x27;s brain and behavior, leading to their inability to control their use of substances like legal or illegal drugs, alcohol, or medications.

The disorders can lead to large societal problems. Substance-related disorders are found to have greatest prevalence in individuals ages 18–25, with a higher likelihood occurring in men compared to women, and urban residents compared to rural residents. On average, general medical facilities hold 22% of patients with substance-related disorders, possibly leading to psychiatric disorders later on. Over 50% of individuals with substance-related disorders will often have a &quot;dual diagnosis,&quot; where they are diagnosed with the substance use, as well as a psychiatric diagnosis, the most common being major depression, personality disorder, anxiety disorders, and dysthymia.

Substance use, also known as drug use, is a patterned use of a substance (drug) in which the user consumes the substance in amounts or with methods which are harmful to themselves or others. The drugs used are often associated with levels of substance intoxication that alter judgment, perception, attention and physical control, not related with medical effects. It is often thought that the main used substances are illegal drugs and alcohol; however it is becoming more common that prescription drugs and tobacco are a prevalent problem.

==Signs and symptoms==

Common symptoms include:
* Sudden changes in behaviour – may engage in secretive or suspicious behaviour 
* Mood changes – anger towards others, paranoia and little care shown about themselves or their future
* Problems with work or school – lack of attendance 
* Changes in eating and sleeping habits 
* Changes in friendship groups and poor family relationships 
* A sudden unexplained change in financial needs – leading to borrowing/stealing money

There are many more symptoms such as physical and psychological changes, though this is often dependent on which substance is being used. It is, however, common that people who use substances will experience unpleasant withdrawal symptoms if the drug is taken away from them.

It is also reported that others have strong cravings even after they have not used the drug for a long period of time. This is called being &quot;clean&quot;. To determine how the brain triggers these cravings, multiple tests have been done on mice. It is also now thought that these cravings can be explained by substance-related disorders as a subcategory of personality disorders as classified by the DSM-5.

==Classification and terminology==

Substance-related disorders were originally subcategorized into &quot;substance use disorders&quot; (SUD) and &quot;substance-induced disorders&quot; (SID). Though DSM-IV makes a firm distinction between the two, SIDs often occur in the context of SUDs.

===Substance-induced disorders===

Substance-induced disorders include medical conditions that can be directly attributed to the use of a substance. These conditions include intoxication, withdrawal, substance-induced delirium, substance-induced psychosis, and substance-induced mood disorders.

===Substance use disorders===
Substance use disorders include substance use and substance dependence. In DSM-IV, the conditions are formally diagnosed as one or the other, but it has been proposed that DSM-V combine the two into a single condition called &quot;Substance-use disorder&quot;.

===Changes in classification===

The more recently published DSM-5 combined substance abuse and substance dependence into a single continuum; this is simply known as substance use disorder and requires more presenting symptoms before a diagnosis is made. It also considers each different substance as its own separate disorder, based upon the same basic criteria. It also distinguishes the difference between dependence and addictions as two separate disorders, not to be confused.

===Complications===

There are many potential complications that can arise due to substance use such as severe physiological damage, psychological changes and social changes that are often not desirable.

Physiological damage is often the most obvious, observed as an abnormal condition affecting the body of an organism: For instance, there are several known alcohol-induced diseases (e.g. alcoholic hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, alcoholic cardiomyopathy.) Substance use is also often associated with premature ageing, fertility complications, brain damage and a higher risk of infectious diseases due to a weakened immune system.

Long-term use has been linked to personality changes such as depression, paranoia, anxiety which can be related to psychological disorders. It is often reported that substance use coincides with personality disorders, such as borderline personality disorder. It has also now been linked to severe brain damage leading to an inability to control behaviours, which could explain why many people who use substances go on to develop addictions.

Substance use is often regarded as negative in society and therefore those who engage in such behaviours can often be subject to social discrimination. The use of many drugs can lead to criminal convictions, whether the drug itself is illegal or people who use them use unlawful methods to fund their substances. It is also more likely that someone will partake in criminal or anti-social behaviour when they are under the influence of a drug.

<doc id="256040" wikidata="Q682918" url="?curid=256040" title="OpenLDAP">
<text>OpenLDAP is a free, open-source implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) developed by the OpenLDAP Project. It is released under its own BSD-style license called the OpenLDAP Public License.

LDAP is a platform-independent protocol. Several common Linux distributions include OpenLDAP Software for LDAP support. The software also runs on BSD-variants, as well as AIX, Android, HP-UX, macOS, OpenVMS, Solaris, Microsoft Windows (NT and derivatives, e.g. 2000, XP, Vista, Windows 7, etc.), and z/OS.

==History==
The OpenLDAP project was started in 1998 by Kurt Zeilenga. The project started by cloning the LDAP reference source from the University of Michigan where a long-running project had supported development and evolution of the LDAP protocol until that project&#x27;s final release in 1996.

, the OpenLDAP project has four core team members: Howard Chu (chief architect), Quanah Gibson-Mount, Hallvard Furuseth, and Kurt Zeilenga. There are numerous other important and active contributors including Ondrej Kuznik, Luke Howard, Ryan Tandy, and Gavin Henry. Past core team members include Pierangelo Masarati.

==Components==
OpenLDAP has four main components:
* slapd – stand-alone LDAP daemon and associated modules and tools.
* lloadd - stand-alone LDAP load balancing proxy server
* libraries implementing the LDAP protocol and ASN.1 Basic Encoding Rules (BER)
* client software: ldapsearch, ldapadd, ldapdelete, and others

Additionally, the OpenLDAP Project is home to a number of subprojects:
* JLDAP – LDAP class libraries for Java
* JDBC-LDAP – Java JDBC – LDAP Bridge driver
* ldapc++ – LDAP class libraries for C++
* LMDB – memory-mapped database library

==Backends==
===Overall concept===
Historically the OpenLDAP server (slapd, the Standalone LDAP Daemon) architecture was split between a frontend that handles network access and protocol processing, and a backend that deals strictly with data storage. This split design was a feature of the original University of Michigan code written in 1996 and carried on in all subsequent OpenLDAP releases. The original code included one main database backend and two experimental/demo backends. The architecture is modular and many different backends are now available for interfacing to other technologies, not just traditional databases.

Note: In older (1.x) releases, the terms &quot;backend&quot; and &quot;database&quot; were often used interchangeably. To be precise, a &quot;backend&quot; is a class of storage interface, and a &quot;database&quot; is an instance of a backend. The slapd server can use arbitrarily many backends at once, and can have arbitrarily many instances of each backend (i.e., arbitrarily many databases) active at once.

===Available backends===
Currently 17 different backends are provided in the OpenLDAP distribution, and various third parties are known to maintain other backends independently. The standard backends are loosely organized into three different categories:
* Data storage backends – these actually store data
** back-bdb: the first transactional backend for OpenLDAP, built on Berkeley DB, removed with OpenLDAP 2.5.
** back-hdb: a variant of back-bdb that is fully hierarchical and supports subtree renames, removed with OpenLDAP 2.5.
** back-ldif: built on plain text LDIF files
** back-mdb: a transactional backend built on OpenLDAP&#x27;s Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB)
** back-ndb: a transactional backend built on MySQL&#x27;s NDB cluster engine, removed with OpenLDAP 2.6.
** back-wiredtiger: an experimental transactional backend built on WiredTiger, introduced with OpenLDAP 2.5.
* Proxy backends – these act as gateways to other data storage systems
** back-asyncmeta: an asynchronous proxy with meta-directory features, introduced with OpenLDAP 2.5.
** back-ldap: simple proxy to other LDAP servers
** back-meta: proxy with meta-directory features
** back-passwd: uses a Unix system&#x27;s passwd and group data
** back-relay: internally redirects to other slapd backends
** back-sql: talks to arbitrary SQL databases, deprecated with OpenLDAP 2.5.
* Dynamic backends – these generate data on the fly
** back-config: slapd configuration via LDAP
** back-dnssrv: Locates LDAP servers via DNS
** back-monitor: slapd statistics via LDAP
** back-null: a sink/no-op backend, analogous to Unix /dev/null
** back-perl: invokes arbitrary perl modules in response to LDAP requests, deprecated with OpenLDAP 2.5.
** back-shell: invokes shell scripts for LDAP requests, removed with OpenLDAP 2.5.
** back-sock: forwards LDAP requests over IPC to arbitrary daemons

Some backends available in older OpenLDAP releases have been retired from use, most notably back-ldbm which was inherited from the original UMich code, and back-tcl which was similar to back-perl and back-shell.

Support for other backends will soon be withdrawn as well. back-ndb is removed now since the partnership with MySQL that led to its development was terminated by Oracle after Oracle acquired MySQL. back-bdb and back-hdb have been removed in favor of back-mdb since back-mdb is superior in all aspects of performance, reliability, and manageability.

In practice, backends like -perl and -sock allow interfacing to any arbitrary programming language, thus providing limitless capabilities for customization and expansion. In effect the slapd server becomes an RPC engine with a compact, well-defined and ubiquitous API.

==Overlays==
===Overall concept===
Ordinarily an LDAP request is received by the frontend, decoded, and then passed to a backend for processing. When the backend completes a request, it returns a result to the frontend, which then sends the result to the LDAP client. An overlay is a piece of code that can be inserted between the frontend and the backend. It is thus able to intercept requests and trigger other actions on them before the backend receives them, and it can also likewise act on the backend&#x27;s results before they reach the frontend. Overlays have complete access to the slapd internal APIs, and so can invoke anything the frontend or other backends could perform. Multiple overlays can be used at once, forming a stack of modules between the frontend and the backend.

Overlays provide a simple means to augment the functionality of a database without requiring that an entirely new backend be written, and allow new functionalities to be added in compact, easily debuggable and maintainable modules. Since the introduction of the overlay feature in OpenLDAP 2.2 many new overlays have been contributed from the OpenLDAP community.

===Available overlays===
Currently there are 25 overlays in the core OpenLDAP distribution, with another 24 overlays in the user-contributed code section, and more awaiting approval for inclusion.

==Other modules==
Backends and overlays are the two most commonly used types of modules. Backends were typically built into the slapd binary, but they may also be built as dynamically loaded modules, and overlays are usually built as dynamic modules. In addition, slapd supports dynamic modules for implementing new LDAP syntaxes, matching rules, controls, and extended operations, as well as for implementing custom access control mechanisms and password hashing mechanisms.

OpenLDAP also supports SLAPI, the plugin architecture used by Sun and Netscape/Fedora/Red Hat. In current releases, the SLAPI framework is implemented inside a slapd overlay. While many plugins written for Sun/Netscape/Fedora/Red Hat are compatible with OpenLDAP, very few members of the OpenLDAP community use SLAPI.

===Available modules===
* Native slapd modules
** acl/posixgroup – support posixGroup membership in access controls
** comp_match – support component-based matching
** kinit – maintain/refresh a Kerberos TGT for slapd
** passwd/ – additional password hashing mechanisms. Currently includes Kerberos, Netscape, RADIUS, and SHA-2.
* SLAPI plugins
** addrdnvalue – add RDN value to an entry if it was omitted in an Add request

==Replication==
OpenLDAP supports replication using Content Synchronization as specified in RFC 4533. This spec is hereafter referred to as &quot;syncrepl&quot;. In addition to the base specification, an enhancement known as delta-syncrepl is also supported. Additional enhancements have been implemented to support multi-master replication.

===syncrepl===
The basic synchronization operation is described in RFC 4533. The protocol is defined such that a persistent database of changes is not required. Rather the set of changes is implied via change sequence number (CSN) information stored in each entry and optimized via an optional session log which is particularly useful to track recent deletes. The model of operation is that a replication client (consumer) sends a &quot;content synchronizing search&quot; to a replication server (provider). The consumer can provide a cookie in this search (especially when it has been in sync with the provider previously). In the OpenLDAP implementation of the RFC 4533, this cookie includes the latest CSN that has been received from the provider (called the contextCSN).

The provider then returns as search results (or, see optimization below, sync info replies) the present (unchanged entry only used in the present phase of the refresh stage) (no attributes), added, modified (represented in the refresh phase as an add with all current attributes), or deleted (no attributes) entries to put the consumer into a synchronized state based on what is known via their cookie. If the cookie is absent or indicates that the consumer is totally out of sync, then the provider will, in the refresh stage, send an add for each entry it has. In the ideal case, the refresh stage of the response contains only a delete phase with just a small set of adds (including those that represent the current result of modifies) and deletes that have occurred since the time the consumer last synchronized with the provider. However, due to limited session log state (also non-persistent) kept in the provider, a present phase may be required, particularly including the presentation of all unchanged entries as a means (inefficient) of implying what has been deleted in the provider since the consumer last synchronized.

The search can be done in either refresh or refreshAndPersist mode, which implies what stages occur. The refresh stage always occurs first. During the refresh stage, two phases may occur: present and delete, where present always occurs before delete. The phases are delimited via a sync info response that specifies which phase is completed. The refresh and persist stages are also delimited via such sync info response. An optional optimization to more compactly represent a group of entries that are to be presented or deleted is to use a sync info response containing a syncIdSet that identifies the list of entryUUID values of those entries.

The present phase is differentiated from the delete phase as follows. Entries that present unchanged entries may only be returned in the present phase. Entries that delete entries may only be provided in the delete phase. In either phase, add entries (including adds that represent all current attributes of modified entries) can be returned. At the end of a present phase, each entry that the consumer has that was not identified in an add entry or present response during the present phase is implicitly no longer in the provider and thus must be deleted at the consumer so as to synchronize the consumer with the provider.

Once the persist stage begins, the provider sends search results that indicate only the add, modify and delete of entries (no present unchanged entry indications) for those entries changed since the refresh stage completed. The persist stage continues indefinitely, meaning that search has no final &quot;done&quot; response. By contrast, in the refresh mode only a refresh stage occurs and such stage completes with a done response that also ends the present or delete phase (whichever phase was currently active).

===delta-syncrepl===
This protocol keeps a persistent database of write accesses (changes) and can represent each modify precisely (meaning only the attributes that have changed). It is still built on the standard syncrepl specification, which always sends changes as complete entries. But in delta-syncrepl, the transmitted entries are actually sent from a log database, where each change in the main database is recorded as a log entry. The log entries are recorded using the LDAP Log Schema.

<text>A science magazine is a periodical publication with news, opinions, and reports about science, generally written for a non-expert audience. In contrast, a periodical publication, usually including primary research and/or reviews, that is written by scientific experts is called a &quot;scientific journal&quot;. Science magazines are read by non-scientists and scientists who want accessible information on fields outside their specialization.

Articles in science magazines are sometimes republished or summarized by the general press.

<text>Martin Wagner (born April 27, 1966) is an American artist, cartoonist, and filmmaker.

==Career==
===Comics===

While a student at the University of Texas at Austin, Wagner began &quot;Hepcats&quot; as a comic strip in the college newspaper &quot;The Daily Texan&quot; in 1987. Starting in 1989, he self-published it as a black-and-white comic book series and it gained more exposure with the assistance of Dave Sim, who allowed Wagner to submit a page to his bi-weekly reprints of &quot;Cerebus&quot;. To help support the comics financially, Wagner also offered sketches to fans who sent him cash in the mail. Although the series received critical praise, the combination of poor sales, Wagner&#x27;s lack of business experience, and his divorce in 1991 contributed to financial difficulties. Along with Jeff Smith (&quot;Bone&quot;), Colleen Doran (&quot;A Distant Soil&quot;), James Owen (&quot;Starchild&quot;), Larry Marder (&quot;Beanworld&quot;) and Sim, Wagner was one of the prominent self-publishers of the 1990s, but a hectic schedule eventually led him to cease publishing the series altogether following issue No. 12 in 1994. In 1996 he made a deal with Antarctic Press to republish the existing material, to be followed by new issues, but the only new material published was a special &quot;#0&quot; color issue. Wagner also developed the &quot;Snowblind&quot; story-line as part of the &quot;Hepcats&quot; series which would be re-printed into a novel, but it never continued past part one.

===Film===
Following his departure from the comics industry, Wagner illustrated children&#x27;s books and began a new career working in Austin-area film and television commercial productions. In 1999, Wagner produced some early conceptual drawings for director Robert Rodriguez (who was also a cartoonist at the University of Texas at the same time as Wagner) for his film &quot;Spy Kids&quot;, though he did not work on the film during production or any of its sequels. 

In 2005, Wagner was slated to direct a 24p high-definition short film, &quot;Tremendous Risk for Mr. Ferdico&quot;, but when the producers failed to secure funding, he shifted his attentions to a documentary, &quot;Bloody Work&quot;, which was successfully funded on Kickstarter in the summer of 2013, but was never released, with updates to the campaign ceasing in 2016. 

Wagner was a rotating co-host on the webcast and public access show &quot;The Atheist Experience&quot; from 2000 to 2016.

<doc id="256048" wikidata="Q461614" url="?curid=256048" title="Gudfred">
<text>Gudfred was a ninth century Danish king who reigned from at least 804 to 810. Alternate spellings include &quot;Godfred&quot; (Danish), &quot;Göttrick&quot; (German), &quot;Gøtrik&quot; (Danish), &quot;Gudrød&quot; (Danish), and &quot;Godofredus&quot; (Latin). He stands at the threshold of the History of Denmark in the sense that he is the first ruler about whom there is substantial knowledge from contemporary sources. He waged offensive war against the Carolingian Empire with some success, but was murdered under murky circumstances before a major confrontation had taken place. There is no unambiguous trace of Gudfred in the later Norse sagas, and his history can only be traced from the hostile Frankish texts which makes an assessment of his role problematic. His paternity is unknown but he may have been closely related to Sigfred, who preceded him as king of Denmark c. 770–804. He was the uncle of the later Danish King Hemming (810–812) and the father of King Horik I (813–854).

==Family==

Gudfred is known to have sired at least five sons, as well as having at least five nephews. Several of them served as rulers or co-rulers of the Danes between 810 and 854. His sons are typically called &quot;sons of Gudfred&quot; without mention of their names, apart from Horik I. Various modern scholars have used later Scandinavian, Frankish and Irish sources in a speculative way to determine the names of some of his other sons: Olaf, Ragnar, Kettil. Nothing of this is conclusive, however. Hemming is mentioned in the Royal Frankish Annals as son to an unnamed brother of Gudfred. Other nephews were Ragnvald, Håkon, Angantyr and Sigfred. The &quot;Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot; of Adam of Bremen considers Hemming and Gudfred to be &quot;patruelis&quot;, paternal cousins, but this is a derivative work. Horik I seems to have survived his siblings and cousins, and became the sole ruler around 828.

A rival royal branch, represented in the first place by Harald Klak (812-813, 819-827), based its claim on being kinsmen of a former King Harald. This Harald may have been a predecessor, co-ruler or short-lived successor of Sigfred.

==Failed diplomatic overtures==

Towards the end of the 8th century, the Danes and their Saxon neighbours were facing challenges from the Franks under the expansive regime of Charlemagne. In 798, the Saxons were defeated by the Obodrites, a West Slavic people allied to the Frankish Emperor Charlemagne, at the Battle of Bornhöved (or Schwentine River). A part of the Saxons&#x27; land, in Holstein north of the Elbe, was awarded to the Obodrites in 804, as a reward for their victory. That same year, a Frankish army penetrated as far as the Ejder (Eider), Denmark&#x27;s southern boundary at the time. In the face of these developments Gudfred promised to meet Charlemagne in person for a parley. After some time he appeared at Sliesthorp (Schleswig, Hedeby) with his fleet and the entire cavalry of his kingdom. This place marked the border between Saxony and Gudfred&#x27;s realm. However, the king&#x27;s men advised Gudfred against meeting the emperor, and he failed to appear. Charlemagne established a camp at Hollenstedt at the Elbe and sent an errand to Gudfred, asking him to extradite some rebels who had taken refuge in the Danish kingdom. Nothing is known to have come out of this, and the emperor returned to Cologne in September in the same year. 

Three years after these events, in 807, a Danish chief called Halfdan swore allegiance to Charlemagne for protection. He is often assumed to have been the father of the later king and pretender Harald Klak and brother of the former King Harald, which probably means that he refused to pay allegiance to Gudfred due to a dynastic contest. It may be that Halfdan became earl of some wealthy market towns south of the river Ejder, occupying what became known as North Frisia. This region later became a base for his descendants.

==Viking invasion of the Obodrite lands==

Fearing an invasion by the Franks, who had conquered heathen Frisia over the previous 100 years and Old Saxony in 772 to 804, Gudfred resolved to attack the Obodrites in the old Saxon territories. The seaborne invasion was successful in spite of considerable Danish losses. During a siege his brother&#x27;s son Ragnvald, the second man in the kingdom, fell together with several chiefs. Now Gudfred conquered a number of Slavic strongholds and made two districts pay taxes to him. The Obodrite prince Drożko (lat: Thrasco, Thrasucon) was expelled from his land, and another chief called Godelaib was captured by trickery and hanged. The Slavic Linones, Smeldingi and Wiltzes, the last-mentioned being old enemies of the Obodrites, preferred to fight on the Danish side.

Before returning to his kingdom, Gudfred destroyed the important port Reric by the Baltic coast, probably in the modern Blowatz municipality. It is specified that Reric was a Danish name, and that the port brought great advantages to Gudfred&#x27;s kingdom through the imposition of fees. By this feat he may have impeded Charlemagne from using Reric as part of a strategic trade route. The merchants were forced to follow the Viking fleet to Sliesthorp where the king stayed for some time and drew up plans for the future. Fearing Frankish reprisals, he now decided to seal the border to Saxony with a wall, later known as Danevirke. As well established by modern archaeology, a defensive wall existed long before the time of Gudfred, from about 737. While the Frankish annals give the impression of a new creation, it was therefore an improvement of an old structure to defend his realm. Archaeologists have identified it with the so-called Kovirke, a phase of Danevirke built about 800. The improved Danevirke ran from the Schlei toward the west coast of Denmark by means of the river Trende. The wall was built with an earthen embankment topped by a wooden stockade and protected from the south by a deep ditch. There was only one gate through which horsemen and wagons could move back and forth. Denmark&#x27;s most important town, Sliesthorp or Hedeby, which apparently already existed on the Schlien, was expanded and garrisoned with Danish soldiers and the early sections of the wall were designed to protect it. Archaeological finds confirm that the town began to flourish in earnest around 810.

Hearing about the Danish invasion, Charlemagne ordered his son Charles the Younger to bring an army of Franks and Saxons to the Elbe, in case the rash Gudfred would try anything against the ethnic Saxon territory. Charles did not attempt to attack the Danish homeland but he ravaged the lands of the Linones and Smeldingi and then returned. In the next year 809, Gudfred informed Charlemagne via travelling merchants, that he was aware of the emperor&#x27;s ire over the invasion, and wished to negotiate a political solution. The emissaries of Charlemagne met with the Danish grandees at Badenfliot at the river Eider, but failed to negotiate peace. Now the Obodrite prince Drożko appeared again with Saxon auxiliaries and ferociously attacked Gudfred&#x27;s allies, the Wiltzes, in spite of the fact that his own son was a hostage at Gudfred&#x27;s court. He then subjugated the Slavic lands which had acknowledged the Danish king and successfully reclaimed his old position. However, Drożko was soon murdered in the rebuilt Reric by assassins dispatched by Gudfred. That the emperor was seriously worried over &quot;the presumptions and arrogance of the Danish king&quot; is seen from the establishment of a garrison to the north of the Elbe, Esesfelth. He also enjoined his subjects to hold special religious services to avert the pagan threat.

==Invasion of Frisia and death==

In 810 Charlemagne stayed at his main residence in Aachen, drawing up plans for a major military expedition against Gudfred. However, the Danish ruler forestalled his plans. A Viking fleet of 200 sails unexpectedly attacked Frisia. Gudfred did not follow the fleet but stayed at home. The Danes ravaged the islands off the coast, before landing at the mainland. The local troops met the marauders but were defeated in three battles, after which the inhabitants gave up. The Vikings forced the merchants and peasants to pay 100 pounds of silver as &quot;tax&quot;, implying that the king claimed Northern Frisia as Danish territory. According to the contemporary historian Einhard, Gudfred &quot;was stuck-up by such a vain hope that he claimed the lordship over all of Germany; also, he did not see Frisia and Saxony as anything else but his provinces&quot;.

Hearing this, the incensed emperor gathered whatever troops he could and established a camp at the confluence of Aller and Weser, awaiting the next step by the Danish ruler. As the annals say, &quot;this king, intoxicated by the hope of victory, bragged that he wanted to fight the emperor on the open field&quot;. Before more had been done, however, news arrived about the withdrawal of the Viking fleet and the hasty demise of Gudfred, who had been murdered by one of his housecarls (). Details about the drama are given by Notker of St Gall (c. 883), who is however unreliable. In this version Gudfred hunted ducks with falcon when he was attacked by his own son who cut him dead with his sword. The reason for the murder was that the king had abandoned his wife, who begged her son to avenge the slight.

The war against the Carolingian empire ended with the demise of Gudfred. He was succeeded by his nephew Hemming without any known commotion, and the new ruler concluded a peace treaty with the Franks in 811. The Danish kingdom was incapacitated by violent dynastic infighting after 812 which temporarily diminished the Danish menace to the Frankish realm.

==The realm of Gudfred==

Modern archaeology has found indications of a Danish kingdom of some consequence, several generations before Gudfred. The early urban center and coinage in Ribe (c. 700), the construction of the Kanhave Canal in Samsø (c. 726), and the early phases of the Danevirke (c. 737) suggest that at least parts of present-day Denmark were dominated by a nascent royal power in the 8th century. The rash and confronting politics of Gudfred may indicate that he had access to considerable resources. The Frankish annals only expressly state that Gudfred ruled in South Jutland, but there are some hints of a wider sphere of royal power in the early 9th century. The peace treaty of 811 mentions a delegate from Skåne (Sconaowe) which may speak for a Danish realm on both sides of Öresund. In 813 a rebellion against the current Danish kings broke out in Vestfold, suggesting temporary suzerainty over part of southern Norway.

==Possible connections with the saga literature==

In spite of his historical importance, there is no clear trace of Gudfred in the Norse saga literature of the 12th-14th centuries. Saxo Grammaticus mentions him under the name Gøtrik, but his information is drawn from Adam of Bremen&#x27;s chronicle (c. 1075) in conjunction with an unrelated Geatish saga character. According to Saxo, Gøtrik was followed on the throne by his son Olaf who strove to avenge his father and thereby involved Denmark in civil war. This Olaf is unknown to Frankish sources and seems to be from local Danish tradition. The genealogical poem &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, the date of which is disputed, mentions a King Gudrød the Hunter of Vestfold, son of Halfdan the Mild and grandfather of Harald Fairhair of Norway, who was slain by the servant of his vengeful wife Åsa. The apparent similarities to the account of Notker of St Gall has led a number of scholars to assume that the two figures are identical. This may be strengthened by Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s Heimskringla which mentions Gudrød as a Danish king (in Skåne). Most scholars nevertheless dismiss the identification as speculative.

Gudfred also occurs in continental medieval literature. In the poem &quot;La Chevalerie Ogier de Danemarche&quot; (around 1200) he is called Gaufroi de Danemarche, being the father of the renowned hero Ogier the Dane. In the poem Gudfred gives his son as hostage to Charlemagne.

<text>Robert Gregory Bourdon (born January 20, 1979) is an American musician, best known as a co-founding member and the former drummer of the rock band Linkin Park. He remained in the band until their hiatus in 2017; when the band members began working together out of the public eye in 2019, he declined to rejoin the band and was succeeded by Colin Brittain.

==Early life==
Bourdon was born in Calabasas, California. He received classical piano lessons at a young age. He was inspired to play the drums after attending an Aerosmith concert, where he was personally introduced to drummer Joey Kramer. He also cites Tower of Power and Earth, Wind and Fire as his early influences. Bourdon attended Agoura High School in Agoura Hills where he met future bandmates Brad Delson and Mike Shinoda, in the high school&#x27;s jazz band. Bourdon waited tables at a restaurant and worked as a party coordinator at a bowling alley prior to becoming a full-time musician. He attended Santa Monica College where he studied accounting.

==Career==
Bourdon and Brad Delson formed their own band, Relative Degree. The band played a sell-out concert at the Roxy Theatre before breaking up. 

Bourdon later joined Delson and Mike Shinoda to form Linkin Park, then known as Xero, in 1996. The band enjoyed mainstream success with their debut album, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; (2000), which would later go on to become 12× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Bourdon served as Linkin Park&#x27;s drummer for seven studio albums and many international tours. Beyond drums and percussion, he also handled the band&#x27;s business operations with Delson and bassist Dave Farrell. 

Bourdon played the drums for ten hours a day for seven consecutive days, mainly practicing &quot;Keys to the Kingdom&quot;, during the production of the band&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;The Hunting Party&quot;. He injured his back, but later recovered. 

He remained with Linkin Park through 2017, when the band went on hiatus following the death of vocalist Chester Bennington. Bourdon later informed the other members that he wished to distance himself from the band, and did not participate in re-release promotional activities or the 2024 compilation album &quot;Papercuts&quot;. Linkin Park announced their reformation on September 5, 2024, with new members, including Colin Brittain replacing Bourdon.

==Musical influences==
Bourdon&#x27;s musical influences include Led Zeppelin, Tower of Power, Aerosmith, The Police, Bad Religion, Steely Dan, System of a Down, Incubus, and Dave Matthews Band.
==Personal life==
Bourdon resides in Los Angeles. He is Jewish.

<doc id="256050" wikidata="Q7747432" url="?curid=256050" title="The Link (UK organization)">
<text>The Link was a British pro-Nazi, independent, non-party organisation to promote Anglo-German friendship established in July 1937 and terminated by the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. At its height, its membership numbered around 4,300 in 35 chapters. It was founded by Admiral Barry Domvile as an explicitly pro-Nazi alternative to the less overtly pro-Nazi Anglo-German Fellowship. The Link generally operated as a cultural organisation hosting parties, dances, and film nights, although its magazine, &quot;The Anglo-German Review&quot;, reflected pro-Nazi views, and its chapters often hosted antisemitic and pro-Nazi speeches in addition to other cultural activities. It attracted a number of antisemites and pro-Nazis, particularly in its London and Belfast chapters, while also attracting some anti-war pacifists including the Labour Party member Wenman J. Bassett-Lowke. 

Shortly before Britain entered World War II, the organisation was investigated by MI5 and the British Home Secretary confirmed that The Link had acted as an instrument of the German propaganda service. During the war its founder, Domvile, was interned under Defence Regulation 18B, after being implicated in a fascist plot against the British government in 1940.

== Origins ==
A prior organisation with similar aims, the Anglo-German Fellowship, had been founded in 1935 by Ernest Tennant with the aid of Joachim von Ribbentrop as an unabashedly elitist organisation intended to bring together German and British elites. It had a complementary organisation in Berlin, the Deutsch-Englische Gesellschaft. The Fellowship was pro-German, but internally divided over the question of Nazi antisemitism. 

One of the antisemitic members of the executive board of the Fellowship was the retired Admiral Barry Domvile who was quite outspoken about his beliefs about a Jewish-Masonic conspiracy to take over the world. Domvile was displeased with Fellowship&#x27;s refusal to directly endorse Nazi antisemitism and with its elitism. He broke away in 1937 to found The Link as an openly pro-Nazi and antisemitic group that, as its name suggested, was to serve as a link with the Nazi Party, on a suggestion from the editor of &quot;The Anglo-German Review&quot;, Cola Ernest Carroll. Domvile established The Link in July 1937 as an &quot;independent non-party organisation to promote Anglo-German friendship&quot;. In a press release, Domvile announced that the purpose of The Link was &quot;to foster the mutual knowledge and understanding that ought to exist between the British and German peoples&quot; and to counter the &quot;flood of lies&quot; written about Nazi Germany by allegedly Jewish-controlled British media.

== Organisation ==
The national council of The Link comprised Admiral Barry Domvile, the retired Sir John Brown of the British Legion, &quot;Anglo-German Review&quot; editor Cola Ernest Carroll, the chemist Arthur Pillans Laurie, Susan Fass of the Anglo-German &quot;Kameradschaft&quot; and the historian Raymond Beazley. As The Link grew in numbers, other prominent people who joined its national council included the father of the Mitford Sisters, Lord Redesdale; the Conservative MP, Sir Albert Lambert Ward; the war hero, Captain Edward Unwin, who won a Victoria Cross at the Battle of Gallipoli; the aviation pioneer and later traitor, Lord Sempill; Councilor Wenman J. Bassett-Lowke of the Northampton city council; A.E.R. Dyer; Archibald Crawford and Hubert Maddocks. A notable late addition to The Link&#x27;s national council who joined in the summer of 1939 was the Duke of Westminster, a landlord who owned much of London and was one of the richest men in the world. 

Of the members of the national council, Domvile, Carroll and Laurie were the most active while Ward, Unwin, Redesdale and Semphill merely lent their names to add prestige to the group. Bassett-Lowke, the president of the Northampton chapter; Maddocks, the president of the Southend chapter; and Beazley, the president of the Birmingham chapter were included on The Link&#x27;s national council because their chapters were the largest chapters. 

In March 1938, The Link had 1,800 members and it had 2,400 by July 1938. By June 1939, The Link had 4,300 members and 35 branches. The majority of the chapters of The Link were located in the London area and in the Midlands, though there were also large chapters in the West Country; &quot;service towns&quot; such as Bromley and Portsmouth; and Northern Ireland. The majority of the members of The Link were middle class and the group drew strong support from members of municipal councils with aldermen and councilors being well represented in its ranks. 

Presumably because Domvile was a retired admiral, some of the chapters tended to be dominated by retired members of the Royal Navy. By contrast, the chapters in the West Country were more dominated by former Army officers and the gentry. Despite the organisation&#x27;s stated purpose of being a link to the Nazi Party, the majority of its members seemed unaware of this. The British historian Richard Griffiths wrote: &quot;The members were perfectly ordinary people, drawn to Anglo-German friendship, who seem to have been almost unaware of the political implications of membership&quot;.

== Activities ==

=== Chapter activities ===
The Southend chapter seems to have been typical of The Link with the majority of its activities devoted to parties, dances and film nights. However, both Barry Domvile and Arthur Pillans Laurie gave explicitly political speeches at the Southend chapter on the subject of seeking closer relations with Nazi Germany. A German professor, Dr. Otto Wagner, gave a speech at the Southend chapter on 7 April 1938 on &quot;the aims of German foreign policy&quot;. Finally, Hubert Maddocks gave a speech at the Southend chapter that complained that the British newspapers were trying to sabotage Anglo-German friendship by giving undue attention to the persecution of the Jews in Germany.

The Croydon chapter had an Anglican churchman give a speech on &quot;peace through friendship&quot; with Germany and sent the children of its members off to a trip to Hamburg, Germany to spend the summer of 1938 as guests of the Hitler Youth.

The most overtly fascistic of The Link&#x27;s chapters were the Belfast, Acton and Ealing, and Central London chapters. The Central London chapter, which was founded in January 1939, was the most clearly anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi of The Link&#x27;s chapters and its president, Margaret Bothamley, was an outspoken anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist. In one of her speeches given in May 1939, Bothamley stated: &quot;the Jewish question was behind the determination to assert the &#x27;independence&#x27; of Austria&quot;. Other speakers at the Central London chapter in 1939 included Philip Spranklin, formerly of the British Union of Fascists (BUF) who was now working as a spokesman for the Foreign Press Office of the German Ministry of Propaganda; General J. F. C. Fuller, the defense correspondent of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and the military adviser to the BUF who just returned from attending Hitler&#x27;s 50th birthday in Berlin on 20 April 1939; and the Conservative MP, Archibald Ramsay who gave a speech in June 1939 on &quot;The Secret Forces Working for War&quot;.

=== &quot;The Anglo-German Review&quot; ===
The Link was closely associated with the monthly glossy magazine &quot;The Anglo-German Review&quot;, known for its pro-German, anti-French stances and its flattering cover images and features for Nazi Party officials such as Adolf Hitler, Joseph Goebbels, and Hermann Göring&quot;.&quot; 

The &quot;Review&quot; technically began operations almost a year before The Link was established, in September 1936, and remained technically independent, but Domvile nonetheless referred to it as &quot;the organ of publicity used by the &#x27;Link&#x27;&quot;, the &quot;Review&quot;&#x27;s offices were next to The Link&#x27;s offices on London&#x27;s Strand, and the editor of the &quot;Review&quot; was Cola Ernest Carroll who was also a member of The Link&#x27;s national council and who had suggested establishing The Link to Domvile. The Link also channeled funds from the Nazis to the &quot;Review.&quot; Carroll was a severely wounded veteran of World War I who had previously worked as editor for the newspaper of the British Legion. Due to limited staffing, Carroll also wrote lead news and analysis each month.

=== The Link letter ===
On 12 October 1938, a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; that came to be known as &quot;The Link letter&quot; was published. The letter read: 

Not all who signed the letter were members of The Link, and for this reason the letter is often seen as a sign of The Link&#x27;s influence. Of the signatures who were members of The Link included Admiral Domvile, C.E. Carroll, Raymond Beazley; A.E.R. Dyer; Lord Redesdale and Arthur Laurie. People who were not members of The Link at the time who signed the letter included the Conservative MP Archibald Ramsay; Admiral Wilmot Nicholson; George Pitt-Rivers; Nesta Webster; Lord Londonderry; Lord Mount Temple; William Harbutt Dawson; the politician Lord Arnold; the Conservative MP John Smedley Crooke; the journalist Douglas Jerrold; the former Viceroy of India Lord Hardinge of Penhurst; Lord Fairfax; Sir John Latta; Bernard Acworth; Arthur Solly-Flood; Arthur Rogers; Vincent Molteno; and Admiral Edward Inglefield.

=== Appeals to pacifism and Labour ===
The Link opposed war between Britain and Germany and thus attracted the support of some British pacifists. After The Link and the &quot;Anglo-German Review&quot; were included among peace organisations across the political spectrum in the &quot;Peace Service Handbook,&quot; a publication put out by the Peace Pledge Union in May 1939, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in July 1939 published a memorandum of the Economic League asserting that the PPU was being used as a channel for Nazi propaganda and the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; on 11 August 1939 published an interview of PPU member Stuart Morris containing the quote &quot;I&#x27;m all for giving a great deal more away [to Hitler]. I don&#x27;t think that Mr. Chamberlain has really started yet on any serious appeasement.&quot; 

The PPU was a much larger organisation, with 130,000 members in 1,150 local groups before the war in contrast to The Link&#x27;s 4,300 members and 35 branches. In response to the &quot;News Chronicle&quot;, PPU member Stuart Morris wrote to the paper on 13 August 1939 stating there was no connection between the PPU and The Link and that the PPU did not support the German demand for colonies or support peace at the expense of smaller nations. The PPU also sent a letter to its group leaders dissociating The Link from the PPU and ceased publishing the &quot;Peace Service Handbook&quot;.

Wenman J. Basset-Lowke, the president of the Northampton chapter of The Link, was also a member of the Labour Party. Lord Paget in a letter of 17 September 1976 wrote: &quot;Bill Bassett-Lowke was a model manufacturer, a Fabian Socialist; an internationalist, as good as gold, and as soft as a mop. He was a natural sucker for The Link&quot;. In the summer of 1939, there was some discussion about whatever Bassett-Lowke could be a member of both the Labour Party and The Link at the same time, and there were demands made by some Labour Party activists that Bassett-Lowke be expelled if he continued to serve as the president of The Link&#x27;s Northampton chapter. The national executive of the Labour Party dithered over the question of expelling Bassett-Lowke and the matter had still not been resolved by September 1939, when the United Kingdom entered World War II.

The Labour Party was badly divided in the 1930s between a pacifistic faction opposed to all war in general along with rearmament vs. a faction that was willing to support a war provided it was done so under the auspices of the League of Nations to resist aggression. The Sudetenland crisis of 1938 caused much internal tension in the Labour Party between its anti-war vs anti-fascist wings with some Labour MPs stating that it would amoral for Britain to go to war against Germany under the grounds that all wars were evil while other Labour MPs argued that Britain had a moral duty to defend Czechoslovakia should Germany invade. By the time of the Danzig crisis in March 1939, the anti-fascist wing of the Labour Party was in ascendency. Labour accepted the imposition of peacetime conscription by the Chamberlain government in May 1939 despite having previously vowed to oppose such a policy and urged the government to create the &quot;peace front&quot; to unite Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in an alliance meant to deter Germany from invading Poland. 

The decision by the Labour National Executive to essentially ignore the question of whatever Basset-Lowke should be expelled from the Labour Party represented a concession to the anti-war wing of the Labour Party. Basset-Lowke presented himself not as a fascist, but merely a man of peace who was trying to prevent a world war by seeking better understanding between the British and German peoples.

== Investigation and termination ==
The organisation was investigated by Maxwell Knight, head of counter-subversion in MI5. Of all the various British fascist groups, The Link was the one most suspect to British officials because of its ties to the Nazi Party. In the summer of 1939, The Link&#x27;s leader Barry Domvile&#x27;s phone was tapped by MI5, which revealed that he was making regular phone calls to George Ward Price, the &quot;extra-special correspondent&quot; of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper, urging him to write articles calling for Britain to abandon the &quot;guarantee&quot; of Poland. On August 3, 1939, British Home Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare confirmed to Parliament that The Link had been used as an instrument of German propaganda and that at least one of its organisers had been funded by Germany, albeit legally, via a question from Liberal Party MP Sir Geoffrey Mander.

The Link was not so pro-Nazi as to be overtly anti-British, and it closed immediately after the United Kingdom&#x27;s entry into World War II against Germany on 3 September 1939. Domvile put out a statement in &quot;The Times&quot; on 7 September 1939 to the effect that, with war declared, “the King’s enemies became our enemies. We had done our best for better Anglo-German relations ... and there was no more to be done.”

Nonetheless, Domvile was interned in 1940 under Defence Regulation 18B, as someone who might be &quot;prejudicial to the public safety or the defence of the realm&quot;. He had been recently implicated in a fascist plot against the British government.

Anthony Masters has alleged that the Link was resurrected in 1940 by Ian Fleming, then working in the Department of Naval Intelligence, in order to successfully lure Rudolf Hess (deputy party leader and third in leadership of Germany, after Adolf Hitler and Hermann Göring) to Britain in May 1941.

<doc id="256054" wikidata="Q8010611" url="?curid=256054" title="William H. Swanson">
<text>William H. Swanson (born 1949) is an American businessman, engineer and car collector who is the former chairman and CEO of Raytheon Company (2004 -2014).

==Education==

A native of California, Swanson graduated magna cum laude from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in aerospace engineering. He attended Cal Poly with the assistance of a golf scholarship. He was awarded an honorary Doctorate from Pepperdine University and served on the Board of Regents of Pepperdine. He was selected as the Outstanding Industrial Engineering Graduate in 1972, and in 1991 was recognized as an Honored Alumnus by California Polytechnic State University College of Engineering. He attended a graduate degree program in business administration at Golden Gate University.

==Career ==
=== Raytheon ===
Swanson joined Raytheon in 1972 and held a wide range of leadership positions, including manufacturing manager of the company’s Equipment Division, general manager of the Missile Systems Division&#x27;s Andover Plant, senior vice president and general manager of the Missile Systems Division, general manager of Raytheon Electronic Systems, and president, chairman and chief executive officer of Raytheon Systems Company.

Before becoming chairman of Raytheon in January 2004, Swanson was CEO and president of the company. Prior to that he was president of the company, responsible for Raytheon’s government and defense operations, including the four Strategic Business Areas of Missile Defense; Precision Engagement; Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR); and Homeland Security. Before that, he was a Raytheon executive vice president and president of Electronic Systems.

As a protégé of Chairman and CEO Dennis Picard and a long-time Raytheon insider, he was the expected candidate to succeed the retiring chairman in the late 1990s. However, Daniel Burnham, an outsider, was elected to succeed Dennis Picard as Chairman and CEO. After Burnham completed a five-year contract with Raytheon, Swanson was elevated to his position.

Swanson stepped down from the CEO position in March 2014 and retired from Raytheon entirely in September 2014. He was succeeded by Dr. Thomas A. Kennedy, who had previously served as Raytheon&#x27;s Chief Operating Officer.

== Car Collection ==
Swanson is the owner and curator of an entirely-red collection of exotic vehicles based in Arroyo Grande, California. The collection, which primarily houses Ferraris, includes cars from the 1960s to the modern day.

==Swanson&#x27;s &quot;Unwritten Rules of Management&quot; and plagiarism==

Swanson released a short work called &quot;Swanson&#x27;s Unwritten Rules of Management&quot;, thirty three sound-bite rules, including the comparatively well known &quot;Waiter Rule&quot;.

On April 24, 2006, in a statement released by Raytheon, Swanson admitted to plagiarism in claiming authorship for his booklet, &quot;Swanson&#x27;s Unwritten Rules of Management,&quot; after being exposed by an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. On May 2, 2006, Raytheon withdrew distribution of the book. On May 3, 2006, Raytheon punished Swanson by reducing his compensation by approximately $1 million for publishing what was &quot;later found to have been taken from a 1944 engineering classic, &quot;The Unwritten Laws of Engineering&quot;, by W. J. King.&quot; Further investigation by the Boston Herald revealed that Swanson had also copied some of the rules from former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and columnist Dave Barry.

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, the major newspaper in Raytheon&#x27;s home town, reported &quot;the move was largely symbolic given Swanson&#x27;s robust $7 million pay package in 2005.&quot;

Between May 2015 and May 2021 he was chairman of Royal Dutch Shell.

==Early life==
Holliday was born in 1948 and grew up in Nashville, Tennessee. He graduated from John Overton High, where he met his future wife, Ann. Holliday earned his B.S. in industrial engineering from the University of Tennessee in 1970. He was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity Zeta chapter. Holliday started at DuPont in the summer of 1970 at DuPont&#x27;s Old Hickory site. He then turned a summer job at DuPont into a full-time position as an engineer. He advanced through manufacturing and supervisory positions around the world until he was named CEO in 1998.

==Professional career==
Holliday was the 18th CEO of DuPont in more than 200 years of DuPont history. Under Holliday&#x27;s leadership, DuPont established a goal of achieving sustainable growth – increasing shareholder and societal value while simultaneously decreasing DuPont&#x27;s environmental footprint. As a result, DuPont has shifted from being a chemical company to being a science-based products and services company. On September 23, 2008, DuPont announced that Holliday would retire as CEO on December 31, 2008, and that its board of directors had elected Ellen J. Kullman to succeed Holliday with effect from January 1, 2009. On 30 October 2009, DuPont announced that Holliday would retire as chairman with effect from December 31, 2009, and that Kullman had been appointed chairman effective from that date.

Holliday is the chairman of Council on Competitiveness and the Business Roundtable&#x27;s Task Force for Environment, Technology and Economy. Holliday was previously chairman of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and chairman of the Society of Chemical Industry – American Section. He was chairman of The Business Council in 2003 and 2004. He is a founding member of the International Business Council and is on the board of advisors of the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions.

On September 21, 2009, Holliday was elected to the board of directors of Bank of America, and was elected chairman on April 28, 2010. Holliday received an honorary doctorate from Polytechnic University, and is a licensed professional engineer.

Holliday was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2004.

===Compensation===
While CEO of DuPont in 2008, Holliday earned total compensation of $10,213,441, which included a base salary of $1,369,500, a cash bonus of $1,732,000, stocks granted of $4,796,309, and options granted of $2,166,672.

==Publications==
Holliday has co-written a book titled &quot;Walking the Talk&quot;, which details the business case for sustainable development and corporate responsibility.

<text>Halfdan the Old (Old Norse: &quot;Hálfdanr gamli&quot; and &quot;Hálfdanr inn gamli&quot;) was an ancient, legendary king from whom descended many of the most notable lineages of legend. A second Halfdan the Old is the purported great-grandfather of Ragnvald Eysteinsson.

==Halfdan the Old, ancestor of many lineages==

===&quot;Hyndluljód&quot;===
The eddic poem &quot;Hyndluljód&quot; states in verses 14–16:
Though Halfdan is himself called a Skjöldung in verse 14, in verse 16 the Skjöldungs are named instead as one of the families that sprang from Halfdan&#x27;s marriage with Álmveig.

===&quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;===
Snorri Sturluson explains in the &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;:

Snorri then gives examples from skaldic verse where these names are used as general terms for &#x27;lord&#x27; or &#x27;ruler&#x27;. The promise of three hundred years of no women among Halfdan&#x27;s descendants is paralleled in the story of Ríg-Jarl who has sons only but no daughters. See Ríg (Norse god). None of the titles given here duplicate titles such as &quot;hersir&quot;, &quot;jarl&quot;, &quot;konungr&quot;, and &quot;dróttinn&quot; which appear in the Ríg account. Snorri continues:

The Skjöldungs and Skilfings mentioned in the &quot;Hyndluljód&quot; are missing here. The Ylfings are suddenly introduced at the end in a reference to Eirík the Eloquent yet are also not found among the nine families.

Snorri then immediately mentions what seem to be intended as four famous houses not descended from Halfdan the Old:

But Yngvi has been previously named as a son of Halfdan the Old and the Skjöldungs and Skilfings are counted among Halfdan&#x27;s descendants in the &quot;Hyndluljód&quot;.

Snorri continues:

Snorri then quotes many skaldic verses which demonstrate this.

===&quot;Ættartolur&quot;===

====Halfdan and his sons====
The &quot;Ættartolur&quot;, the genealogies appended to the &quot;Hversu Noregr byggdist&quot; in the &quot;Flatey Book&quot; introduce Halfdan the Old as the ruler of Ringiríki (a territory including modern Ringerike and Valdres in Oppland). Halfdan is here the son of King Hring (eponym of Ringeríki) by the daughter of a sea-king named Vífil (&quot;Vífill&quot;). Hring was son of Raum the Old (eponym of Raumaríki) by Hild (&quot;Hildr&quot;) the daughter Gudröd the Old (&quot;Guðrǫðr inn gamli&quot;). Raum the Old was son of Nór (&quot;Nórr&quot;) (the eponym of Norway). See Nór for further details about Nór and his ancestry and descendants.

In his sacrifice Halfdan requested a lifetime of 300 years like that of his ancestor Snær.
The form &quot;Tiggi&quot; appears instead of &quot;Tyggi&quot; in the list of the first nine sons. The list of the second nine sons has Skelfir instead of Yngvi and the form Næfil (&quot;Næfill&quot;) instead of Nefir. The order of the names is the same and it is explained that Hildir, Sigar, and Lofdi were war-kings; Audi, Budli, and Næfil were sea-kings, while Dag, Skelfir, and Bragi remained on their lands.

====Döglings====
Dag married Thóra Heroes-mother (&quot;Thóra drengjamóður&quot;) who bore him nine sons, but only four are named: Óli, Ám (&quot;Ámr&quot;), Jöfur, and Arngrím (&quot;Arngrímr&quot;).

Óli was father of Dag, father of Óleif (&quot;Óleifr&quot;), father of Hring, father of Helgi, father of Sigurd Hart (&quot;Sigurðr Hjǫrtr&quot;), father of Ragnhild (&quot;Ragnhildr&quot;) the mother of Harald Fairhair.

Arngrím married Eyfura who bore him Angantýr the Berserk (&quot;Angantýr berserkr&quot;). Angantýr&#x27;s story is most fully treated in the &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;. It also appears in part in book five of Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; and an account only the deaths of Angantýr and his eleven brothers appears in &quot;Arrow-Odd&#x27;s saga&quot;.

Stanza 18 of the &quot;Hyndluljód&quot; reads:
The name Ám agrees with that of a son of Dag in the &quot;Ættartolur&quot; and Jöfurmar is probably identical with Jöfur of the &quot;Ættartolur&quot;. Fradmar, Gyrd, Álf the Old, and the two Frekis bring the total to seven. Adding the names Óli and Arngrím to this list from the &quot;Ættartolur&quot; brings the tally to nine, as the &quot;Ættartolur&quot; promised. This may be coincidental. It is odd that the &quot;Hyndluljód&quot; here leaves out the only two names for which the &quot;Hversu&quot; provides descendants. It is possible that the following stanzas of the &quot;Hyndluljód&quot; down to stanza 24 cover otherwise unknown members of the Dögling lineage since stanza 23 at least returns to the Dödlings, providing the names of the twelve sons of Arngrím and the following stanza tells of their birth to Arngrím and Eyfura. Áli mentioned in stanza 14 of the &quot;Hyndluljód&quot; (quoted near the beginning of this article) may be identical to Óli son of Dag mentioned in the &quot;Ættartolur&quot;.

====Bragnings====
Bragi the Old [&quot;Bragi gamli&quot;] was king of Valdres and father of Agnar, father of Álf, father of Eirík (&quot;Eiríkr&quot;), father of Hild (&quot;Hildr&quot;) the mother of Halfdan the Generous, the father of Gudröd (&quot;Guðrǫðr&quot;) the Hunter, father of Halfdan the Black, father of Harald Fairhair.

====Skilfings or Skjöldungs====
Skilfir was king of Vörs (&quot;Vǫrs&quot;, modern Voss in northern Hordaland in southwestern Norway. Skelfir was father of Skjöld (&quot;Skjǫldr&quot;), father of Eirík, father of Alrek (&quot;Alrekr&quot;), father of Eirík the Eloquent, father of Alrek the Bold (&quot;Alrekr inn frækni&quot;), father of Víkar (&quot;Víkarr&quot;), father of Vatnar (&quot;Vatnarr&quot;), father of two sons: Ímald (&quot;Ímaldr&quot;) and Eirík, this Eirik being father of Gyda (&quot;Gyða&quot;) who was one of the wives of Harald Fairhair. They were called the Skilfing lineage or Skjöldung lineage. For commentary on this lineage and variant traditions on those listed here as belonging to it see Scylfing and Víkar.

====Hildings====
Hildir was father of Hildibrand (&quot;Hildibrandr&quot;), father of Vígbrand (&quot;Vígbrandr&quot;), father of Hildir and Herbrand (&quot;Herbrandr&quot;). Herbrand was father of Harald Red-beard, father of Ása who was the mother of Halfdan the Black, the father of Harald Fairhair.

(The text actually reads &quot;Harald Grenski&quot; (&quot;Haraldr inn grenski&quot;) instead of Harald Red-beard, but that must be an error. Harald Grenski was the name of a later figure, the father of King Olaf II of Norway, and the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; and many other sources name Harald Red-beard as Ása&#x27;s father.

====Siklings====
Sigar is provided with two sons Siggeir and Sigmund (&quot;Sigmundr&quot;). Siggeir is prominent in &quot;Volsunga saga&quot; as the villainous husband of Signý the daughter of Völsung. Sigmund son of Sigar married Hild, daughter of King Grjótgard (&quot;Grjótgarðr&quot;) of Mœr. (See Gard Agdi for Grjótgard&#x27;s genealogy.) Their son was Sigar, father of Signý, that Sigar who caused Hagbard (&quot;Hagbarðr&quot;) to be hanged.

One of the sources where the story of Hagbard appears is in &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, Book 7, which relates the love between Hagbarthus son of Hamundus and Signe daughter of King Sigarus despite Hagbarthus having slain her brothers. When Sigarus discovered the affair, he had Hagbarthus hanged. Then Hagbarthus&#x27; brother Haco/Hako/Haki avenged Hagbarthus. In this version Sigar/Sigarus is a king of Denmark, son of Sivaldus, son of King Ungvinus who was originally king of Götaland (see Hagbard and Signy for more).

There are places all over Scandinavia, associated with this legend such as Asige in the former Danish (presently Swedish) province of Halland, which borders Götaland, where there are two large menhirs called &quot;Hagbard&#x27;s gallows&quot;.

Hagbard and his brother Haki are mentioned as great sea-kings in the Ynglinga saga where Haki wrests the Swedish throne from king Hugleik (this event also appears in Gesta Danorum where Haco kills the Irish king Huglethus) only to be killed later in battle with Hugleik&#x27;s cousin Jorund.

A third reference to Hagbard and his brother Haki appears in the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;, chapter 25. It is there said that Hagbard and Haki not yet avenged themselves for Sigar&#x27;s abduction of one sister and the slaying of another. Either the reference is garbled or it refers to a lost variant with a more extended account of Sigar&#x27;s feud with Hagbard and his brothers.

See Hagbard and Haki for more.

====Lofdungs====
Lofdi was a great king who raided Reidgotaland (&quot;Reiðgotaland&quot;) and became king there. Lofdi&#x27;s sons were Skekkil Sea-king (&quot;Skekkill sækonungr&quot;) and Skyli. Skyli was father of Egdir (&quot;Egðir&quot;), the father of Hjálmthér (&quot;Hjálmþér&quot;), the father of Eylimi, the father of Hjördís (&quot;Hjǫrdís&quot;), the mother of Sigurd Fáfnir&#x27;s-bane, father of Áslaug (&quot;Áslaugr&quot;) by Brynhild whose ancestry appears below in the Budling discussion. This Áslaug was a wife of Ragnar Lodbrok and by him the mother of Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye (&quot;Sigurðr ormr í auga&quot;) who was father of a second Áslaug who was mother of Sigurd Hart. Sigurd Hart was father of Ragnhild (&quot;Ragnhildr&quot;), mother of Harald Fairhair as already stated.

But stanza 26 of the &quot;Hyndluljód&quot; identifies Eylimi the father of Hjördís as an Ödling.

====Ödlings====
Audi and his brother Budli were sea-kings who raided together and settled in Valland (Gaul) and Saxland (Saxony). Audi ruled in Valland. He was father of Fródi (&quot;Fróði&quot;), father of Kjár (&quot;Kjárr&quot;), father of Ölrún (&quot;Ǫlrún&quot;).

Ölrún, daughter of King Kjár of Valland, appears in the prose introduction to the &quot;Völundarkvida&quot;, as a Valkyrie swan-maiden who became the wife of Völund&#x27;s brother Egil. The name &quot;Kjárr&quot; can be etymologically derived from Latin &quot;Caesar&quot;. But here the connection with France suggests it might be an adaptation of French &quot;Charles&quot;.

====Budlungs====
Budli the sea-king settled down in Saxland. He was father of Attil (&quot;Attill&quot;), father of Vífil (&quot;Vífill&quot;), father of Læfi, father of Budli. This second Budli was father of Sörli (&quot;Sǫrli&quot;) or Serli, of Atli, and of Brynhild. Brynhild was mother of Áslaug, ancestress of Harald Fairhair as described in the previous Lofdungs discussion.

Atli is a legendary version of Attila the Hun and the name Budli comes from Bleda who was the historical Attila&#x27;s elder brother. The name Sörli is given to a brother of Atli only in this text. But in the eddic poem &quot;Atlamál hin grœnlenzku&quot; (stanza 50), Atli declares that he was one of four living brothers when his father Budli died and that half of them are now dead, slain by his wife Gudrún. In the German &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; Attila is called Etzel and said to be son of Botelung, obviously &quot;Budlung&quot; interpreted as a name. In this account Etzel has a younger brother named Bloedelin who was slain by Dancwart, Hagen&#x27;s brother. Blowdelin is probably another memory of the historical Bleda. The eddic poem &quot;Oddrúnargrátr&quot; tells of Atli&#x27;s sister Oddrún and her forbidden love affair with Gunnar, which was, according to this poem, one of the motivations for Atli&#x27;s later treachery. Oddrún is also mentioned in &quot;Sigurðarkviða hin skamma&quot; (stanza 57), in the prose introduction to &quot;Dráp Niflunga&quot;, and in the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;.

====Niflungs====
King Næfil was father of Heimar, father of Eynef (&quot;Eynefr&quot;), father of Rakni, father of Gjúki. Gjúki was father of two sons named Gunnar (&quot;Gunnarr&quot;) and Högni (&quot;Hǫgni&quot;) and of two daughters named Gudrún (&quot;Guðrún&quot;) and Gudný (&quot;Guðný&quot;). For commentary and variant traditions see Nibelung.

==Halfdan the Old of Gór&#x27;s lineage==
The &quot;Orkneying saga&quot; does not speak at all of Nór&#x27;s descendants, but introduces instead a figure named Halfdan the Old as the son of Sveidi (&quot;Sveiði&quot;) the Sea-king, who is called Svadi (&quot;Svaði&quot;) in the &quot;Ættartolur&quot;. Sveidi/Svadi in both texts was son of Heiti, son of Gór who was Nór&#x27;s brother.

This second Halfdan the Old is father of Jarl Ívar of the Uplands who became father of Eystein the Clatterer (&quot;Eysteinn Glumra&quot;), in turn father of Jarl Rögnvald of Møre. The &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; derives both the Jarls of Orkney and the Dukes of Normandy from Rögnvald.

<text>Guineafowl () (or guineahen) are birds of the family Numididae in the order Galliformes. They are endemic to Africa and rank among the oldest of the gallinaceous birds. Phylogenetically, they branched off from the core Galliformes after the Cracidae (chachalacas, guans, and curassows) and before the Odontophoridae (New World quail). An Eocene fossil lineage &quot;Telecrex&quot; has been associated with guineafowl; &quot;Telecrex&quot; inhabited Mongolia, and may have given rise to the oldest of the true phasianids, such as blood pheasants and eared pheasants, which evolved into high-altitude, montane-adapted species with the rise of the Tibetan Plateau. While modern guineafowl species are endemic to Africa, the helmeted guineafowl has been introduced as a domesticated bird widely elsewhere.


==Taxonomy and systematics==
This is a list of guineafowl species, presented in taxonomic order.
===Phylogeny===
Cladogram based on a study by De Chen and collaborators published in 2021.

==Description==
The insect- and seed-eating, ground-nesting birds of this family resemble partridges, but with featherless heads, though both members of the genus &quot;Guttera&quot; have a distinctive black crest, and the vulturine guineafowl has a downy brown patch on the nape. Most species of guineafowl have a dark grey or blackish plumage with dense white spots, but both members of the genus &quot;Agelastes&quot; lack the spots. While several species are relatively well known, the plumed guineafowl and the two members of the genus &quot;Agelastes&quot; remain relatively poorly known. These large birds measure in length, and weigh . Guinea hens weigh more than guinea cocks, possibly because of the larger reproductive organs in the female compared to the male guineafowl. Also, the presence of relatively larger egg clusters in the dual-purpose guinea hens may be a factor that contributes to the higher body weight of the guinea hens.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The species for which information is known are normally monogamous, mating for life, or are serially monogamous; however, occasional exceptions have been recorded for helmeted and Kenya crested guineafowl, which have been reported to be polygamous in captivity. All guineafowl are social, and typically live in small groups or large flocks. Though they are monogamous, species of the least-derived genera &quot;Guttera&quot;, &quot;Agelastes&quot;, and &quot;Acryllium&quot; tend toward social polyandry, a trait shared with other primitive galliforms such as roul roul, and Congo peafowl.

Guineafowl travel behind herd animals and beneath monkey troops, where they forage within manure and on items that have fallen to the understory from the canopy. They play a pivotal role in the control of ticks, flies, locusts, scorpions, and other invertebrates. They pluck maggots from carcasses and manure.

Wild guineafowl are strong flyers. Their breast muscles are dark (aerobic metabolism), enabling them to sustain themselves in flight for considerable distances if hard-pressed. Grass and bush fires are a constant threat to them and flight is the most effective escape.

Some species of guineafowl, like the vulturine, may go without drinking water for extended periods, instead sourcing their moisture from their food. Young guineafowl (called keets) are very sensitive to weather, in particular cold temperatures.

Guinea hens are not known to be good mothers, but in the wild, the guinea hen&#x27;s mate (a guinea cock) may help tend the young keets during the day by keeping them warm and finding food. Sometimes, more than one cock helps raise the young. Guineafowl (hens and cocks together) make good parents. During warm weather, the cock is unlikely to sit on the keets during the night (leaving that duty to the hen), but may help the hen keep them warm at night when temperatures drop below freezing.

Guineafowl may be trained to go into a coop (instead of roosting in trees) when very young. Once hatched and ready to leave the brooder (around three weeks), they may be enclosed in a coop for at least three days so they learn where &quot;home&quot; is. When guinea parents (that already roost in a coop) raise their own keets, the hen sits on them outdoors at night, but then the parents teach the keets to also go into the coop in the evenings around three weeks of age.

Males and females have different calls, which can be used to differentiate between them. Unlike chickens (which generally do best with one rooster for a flock of hens), guineafowl do well with one cock for each hen.

Guineafowl have been shown to act as a deterrent to foxes.
Due to the spread of Lyme disease from ticks, guineafowl are often kept because they will eat the ticks.

==Distribution and habitat==
Guineafowl species are found across sub-Saharan Africa, some almost in the entire range, others more localized, such as the plumed guineafowl in west-central Africa and the vulturine guineafowl in north-east Africa. They live in semiopen habitats such as savanna or semideserts, while some, such as the black guineafowl, mainly inhabit forests. Some perch high on treetops.

The helmeted guineafowl has been introduced in East Africa, South America, the West Indies, the United States, Britain, and India, where it is raised as food or pets.

==Guineafowl as food==
Guineafowl meat is moist, firmer and leaner than chicken meat and has a slight gamey flavour. It has marginally more protein than chicken or turkey, roughly half the fat of chicken and slightly less food energy per gram. Their eggs are substantially richer than those of chickens.

<doc id="256061" wikidata="Q377861" url="?curid=256061" title="Rajendra K. Pachauri">
<text>Rajendra Kumar Pachauri (20 August 1940 – 13 February 2020) was the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) from 2002 to 2015, during the fourth and fifth assessment cycles. Under his leadership the IPCC was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 and delivered the Fifth Assessment Report, the scientific foundation of the Paris Agreement. He held the post from 2002 until his resignation in February 2015 after facing multiple allegations of sexual harassment. In March 2022, he was exonerated of the sexual harassment allegations (The Court of Additional Sessions Judge in Saket Court). He was succeeded by Hoesung Lee. Pachauri assumed his responsibilities as the chief executive of The Energy and Resources Institute in 1981 and led the institute for more than three decades and demitted office as executive vice chairman of TERI in 2016. Pachauri, universally known as Patchy, was an internationally recognized voice on environmental and policy issues, and his leadership of the IPCC contributed to the issue of human-caused climate change becoming recognized as a matter of vital global concern.

==Background==
Pachauri was born in Nainital, India. He was educated at La Martiniere College in Lucknow and at the Indian Railways Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering in Jamalpur, Bihar. He belonged to the Special Class Railway Apprentices, 1958 Batch, an elite scheme which heralded the beginning of mechanical engineering education in India. He began his career with the Indian Railways at the Diesel Locomotive Works in Varanasi. He was admitted to North Carolina State University in Raleigh, United States, where he obtained an MS in Industrial Engineering in 1972, and a PhD with co-majors in Industrial Engineering and Economics in 1974. His doctoral thesis was titled &quot;A dynamic model for forecasting of electrical energy demand in a specific region located in North and South Carolina&quot;. He was a strict vegetarian, largely because of &quot;the environmental and climate change implications.&quot;

==Career==
He served as assistant professor (August 1974 – May 1975) and visiting faculty member (summer 1976 and 1977) in the Department of Economics and Business at NC State. He was a visiting professor of resource economics at the College of Mineral and Energy Resources, West Virginia University. On his return to India, he joined the Administrative Staff College of India, Hyderabad, as Member Senior Faculty (June 1975 – June 1979) and went on to become director, Consulting and Applied Research Division (July 1979 – March 1981). He joined The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) as director in 1982. He was also a senior visiting fellow at the Resource Systems Institute (1982), and visiting research fellow at the World Bank, Washington DC (1990). On 20 April 2002, Pachauri was elected chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations panel established by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to assess information relevant for understanding climate change.

Pachauri was on the board of governors, Shriram Scientific and Industrial Research Foundation (September 1987); the executive committee of the India International Centre, New Delhi (1985 onwards); the governing council of the India Habitat Centre, New Delhi (October 1987 onwards); and the Court of Governors, Administrative Staff College of India (1979–81) and advises such companies as Pegasus Capital Advisors, the Chicago Climate Exchange, Toyota, Deutsche Bank and NTPC. He has served as member of many societies and commissions. He has been the member of board of the International Solar Energy Society (1991–1997), World Resources Institute Council (1992), while Chairman of the World Energy Council (1993–1995), president and then chairman of the International Association for Energy Economics (1988–1990), and the president of the Asian Energy Institute (Since 1992). He was a part-time advisor to the United Nations Development Programme (1994—1999) in the fields of Energy and Sustainable Management of Natural Resources. In July 2001, R K Pachauri was appointed member, Economic Advisory Council to the prime minister of India.

===Work with the IPCC===
On 20 April 2002, Pachauri was elected Chairman of the United Nations established Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Pachauri was vocal on the issue of climate change and said, &quot;What is happening, and what is likely to happen, convinces me that the world must be really ambitious and very determined at moving toward a 350 target.&quot; 350 refers to the level in parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that some climate scientists such as NASA&#x27;s James Hansen agree to be a safe upper limit to avoid a climate tipping point. His career with IPCC came to an abrupt end after the sexual harassment charges against him surfaced in Indian courts.

===2007 Nobel Peace Prize for IPCC===
The IPCC shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with former US vice-president Al Gore, who had earlier criticised Pachauri when he was first elected in 2002.

On 11 December 2007, Pachauri (representing the recipient IPCC) and co-recipient Al Gore delivered their acceptance speeches at an awards ceremony in Oslo, Norway, on a day when delegates to a United Nations climate conference were meeting in Bali, Indonesia. Pachauri referenced his belief that the Hindu philosophy of &quot;&#x27;Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam&#x27;, which means &#x27;the whole universe is one family,&#x27;&quot; must dominate global efforts to protect the global commons.&quot; Returning to this theme throughout his speech, he quoted president of the Maldives in 1987 (Maumoon Abdul Gayoom):

:&quot;...a mean sea level rise of two meters would suffice to virtually submerge the entire country of 1,190 small islands, most of which barely rise two meters above sea level. That would be the death of a nation.&quot;

Pachauri repeatedly emphasised his concerns regarding the implications of climate change for the world&#x27;s poorest nations, referring to studies that:

:&quot;...have raised the threat of dramatic population migration, conflict, and war over water and other resources, as well as a realignment of power among nations. Some also highlight the possibility of rising tensions between rich and poor nations, health problems caused particularly by water shortages and crop failures...

===Commitment to other organisations===
Rajendra K. Pachauri was a member of the Fondation Chirac&#x27;s honour committee, since its launch in 2008 by former French president Jacques Chirac to promote world peace. Dr. Pachauri was also president of the Global Union Of Scientists For Peace in India.

==Lighting a Billion Lives initiative==
Pachauri conceptualised and launched the global &#x27;Lighting a Billion Lives&#x27; (LaBL) initiative in 2008, to facilitate clean energy access to the energy poor. The initiative has taken solar energy to remote places such as Sundarbans, West Bengal, Thar Desert, Rajasthan, and in the state of Bihar. Being an early advocate for integration of access to clean cooking and lighting solution, the initiative has successfully deployed several thousands of Integrated Domestic Energy Systems (IDES) in rural and remote areas. It has set several benchmarks and has emphasized on access to a menu of clean energy options for the poor at last mile locations. LaBL has also been a platform for several technology manufacturers to start-up with business in the clean energy space. The initiative has its footfalls in 13 plus countries and 23 plus states of India.

==Controversies==
===Allegations of conflict of interest and financial anomalies===
Christopher Booker and Richard North wrote an article for the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; in January 2010 alleging potential conflicts of interest related to Pachauri&#x27;s membership of the board of ONGC and to research grants for TERI, a non-profit institution of which Pachauri was director general. They further alleged that financial anomalies existed at TERI Europe. Pachauri denied all allegations.

In response to the allegations, the audit firm KPMG carried out a review at TERI&#x27;s request. The review stated: &quot;No evidence was found that indicated personal financial benefits accruing to Dr Pachauri from his various advisory roles that would have led to a conflict of interest&quot;. The report explains its objectives and methodology and states that &quot;Work done by us was as considered necessary at that point in time&quot; and that it is based on the information provided by TERI, Pachauri and Pachauri&#x27;s tax counsel. In a caveat the review explains that its scope was &quot;significantly different from an audit and cannot be relied on to provide the same level of assurance as an audit&quot;. KPMG examined payments made by private sector companies and found that payments amounting to $326,399 were made to TERI itself, not to Pachauri. He had received only his annual salary from TERI, amounting to £45,000 a year, plus a maximum of about £2,174 from outside earnings. He received no payment for chairing the IPCC.

On 21 August 2010, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; issued an apology, saying that it had &quot;not intended to suggest that Dr Pachauri was corrupt or abusing his position as head of the IPCC and we accept KPMG found Dr Pachauri had not made &quot;millions of dollars&quot; in recent years.&quot; It stated: &quot;We apologise to Dr Pachauri for any embarrassment caused.&quot; The Guardian reported that the Telegraph paid legal costs of over £100,000. Pachauri welcomed the &quot;Telegraph&#x27;s&quot; apology, saying that he was &quot;glad that they have finally acknowledged the truth&quot;, and attributed the false allegations to &quot;another attempt by the climate sceptics to discredit the IPCC. They now want to go after me and hope that it would serve their purpose.&quot;

George Monbiot of &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated his view that despite Pachauri being cleared by KPMG of conflict of interest and financial wrongdoing, false claims had been repeated about him by Richard North, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;The Australian&quot;.

===Sexual harassment case===
On 18 February 2015, Delhi police filed a First Information Report (FIR) against Pachauri on allegations of sexual harassment, stalking and criminal intimidation. On 21 March, the Delhi High Court granted him anticipatory bail. While in May 2015, Pachauri was found guilty of sexual harassment by an internal complaints committee (ICC) of TERI, the findings of the ICC have been challenged before the Industrial Tribunal on the grounds of violation of the principles of natural justice. An article in an Indian magazine The Caravan detailed the exploits of RK Pachauri during his tenure at TERI.

In a statement, Pachauri said that the contents of the charge sheet are “allegations” levelled by the complainant and nothing has been “substantiated” after a year-long investigation. Pachauri has maintained: “From my perspective this was nothing but a very cordial and mutual relationship. There was a light and friendly tone to our correspondence, but at no stage did I ever hint at having a physical relationship nor did I in any way engage in sexual harassment”. Pachauri was granted regular bail from the trial court in July 2016. The court observed &quot;The investigation of the case is complete. Charge sheet has already been filed. He was never arrested during the investigation in the instant case which goes on to show that his custody is not required for the purpose of investigation&quot;.

==Awards and recognition==

*In January 2001, India&#x27;s Government awarded him the Padma Bhushan.
*NDTV Global Indian of the Year for the year 2007.
*Nature News maker of the Year 2007. The magazine lauded Pachauri in an article as an organisation builder &quot;Rajendra Pachauri&#x27;s great strength is in building and organizing institutions in the fields he understands best – engineering and economics as they apply to issues of development&quot;.
*On 14 July 2008, Pachauri received the title UNIDO Goodwill Ambassador.
*In January 2008, he was awarded the second-highest civilian award in India, the Padma Vibhushan.
*In November 2009, Pachauri received the &#x27;Order of the Rising Sun – Gold and Silver Star&#x27; in recognition of his contribution to the enhancement of Japan&#x27;s policy towards climate change. He was bestowed with the decoration by Emperor Akihito.
*In November 2009, Pachauri was rated fifth in the list of &quot;Top 100 Global thinkers&quot; by Foreign Policy magazine, for &quot;ending the debate over whether climate change matters.&quot;
*In February 2010, the president of Finland conferred the Order of the White Rose of Finland to Pachauri in recognition of his work in promoting international co-operation on climate change and sustainable development.
*The French government has awarded him the &#x27;Officer of the Legion of Honour&#x27;.
*HEC Paris appointed Pachauri Professor &quot;Honoris Causa&quot; in October 2009.
*University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne appointed Pachauri Professor &quot;Honoris Causa&quot; in September 2012.

==Other interests==
Other than his academic publications, Pachauri also wrote poetry and fiction. He is the author of &quot;Return to Almora&quot;, a romance novel published in 2010. The novel is in the form of the reminiscences of a retired bureaucrat, once an engineering student, about his spiritual and sexual past. He co-wrote &quot;Moods and Musings&quot;, a collection of poems, with his daughter Rashmi Pachauri-Rajan.

<text>Fróði (; ; Middle High German: &quot;Vruote&quot;) is the name of a number of legendary Danish kings in various texts including &quot;Beowulf&quot;, Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and his &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, and the &quot;Grottasǫngr&quot;. A Danish king by this name also appears as a minor character in the Middle High German epic &quot;Rabenschlacht&quot;. The name is possibly an eponym for the god Freyr.

*The Fróði of the &quot;Grottasǫngr&quot; is said to be the son of Fridleif, the son of Skjǫldr. According to it was in this Fróði&#x27;s beer that King Fjǫlnir drowned. Snorri Sturluson here and in the &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; make this Fróði the contemporary of Roman emperor Augustus and comments on the peacefulness of his reign, referred to as Fróði&#x27;s Peace, suggesting a relationship to the birth of Christ. Though Icelandic sources make this Fróði a very early Danish king, in &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (Book 5), Saxo puts him late in his series of rulers, though including the chronological equation with Augustus and mentioning the birth of Christ.
*The Fróði who, according to &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; and &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, was the father of Halfdan. He would have lived in the 5th or 6th century. He appears to be the same king who later in the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; aided the Swedish king Ongenþeow in defeating the thrall Tunni. Because of this, Egil and his son Ottar (Ohthere) became tributaries to the Danish king.
*Fróði the father of Ingjald, who in &quot;Beowulf&quot; is Froda the father of Ingeld and king of the Heathobards. The existence of the Heathobards has been forgotten in Norse texts and this Fróði there sometimes appears as the brother of Halfdan with the long hostility between Heathobards and Danes becoming a family feud between Halfdan and his brother Fróði. Fróði kills Halfdan and is himself slain by Halfdan&#x27;s sons Helgi (Halga) and Hroar (Hrothgar). (In Arngrímur Jónsson&#x27;s Latin summary to the lost &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; the names Fróði and Ingjald are interchanged. Saxo Grammaticus (Book 6) makes this Fróði instead to be a very late legendary king, the son of Fridleif son of Saxo&#x27;s late peaceful Fróði. Saxo knows some of the story of this feud but nothing of any relationship to Halfdan. Instead Saxo relates how this Fróði was slain by Saxons and how, after a marriage alliance between his son Ingel and a Saxon princess to heal the feud, Ingel opened it again at the urging of an old warrior, just as the hero Beowulf prophesies of Ingjald in the poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;.
*A legend from Ydre in the South Swedish highlands tells that a king known as Frode was killed by Urkon, the same cow that created Lake Sommen.

The form Fróði is still in use in Icelandic and Faroese and appears Latinized as Frotho or Frodo. The latter form of the name is used by J. R. R. Tolkien in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; for the main character of the story, Frodo Baggins. Alternative anglicizations are Frode, Fródi, Fróthi and Frodhi. The Danish, Norwegian and Swedish form is Frode. The meaning of the name is &quot;clever, learned, wise&quot;.

The number of men with the name Frode in Scandinavia as of 2008: Norway (ca.) 11384, Denmark (ca.) 1413, Sweden (ca.) 307.

The &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; describes six Frothos.

*Frotho I
*Frotho II
*Frotho III
*Frotho IV
*Frotho V
*Frotho VI

<doc id="256068" wikidata="Q598332" url="?curid=256068" title="Naval Intelligence Division (United Kingdom)">
<text>The Naval Intelligence Division (NID) was created as a component part of the Admiralty War Staff in 1912. It was the intelligence arm of the British Admiralty before the establishment of a unified Defence Intelligence Staff in 1964. It dealt with matters concerning British naval plans, with the collection of naval intelligence. It was also known as &quot;Room 39&quot;, after its room number at the Admiralty.

==History==
The Foreign Intelligence Committee was established in 1882 and it evolved into the Naval Intelligence Department in 1887.

The NID staff were originally responsible for fleet mobilisation and war plans as well as foreign intelligence collection; thus in the beginning there were originally two divisions: (1) intelligence (Foreign) and (2) Mobilisation. In 1900 another division, War, was added to deal with issues of strategy and defence, and in 1902 a fourth division, Trade, was created for matters related to the protection of merchant shipping. The Trade Division was abolished in October 1909 in the wake of the Committee of Imperial Defence inquiry into the feud between the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir John Fisher and former Commander-in-Chief Channel Fleet, Admiral Lord Charles Beresford, when it was discovered that the captain heading the Trade Division had been supplying the latter with confidential information during the inquiry.

In 1910, the NID was shorn of its responsibility for war planning and strategy when the outgoing Fisher created the Navy War Council as a stop-gap remedy to criticisms emanating from the Beresford Inquiry that the Navy needed a naval staff—a role the NID had been in fact fulfilling since at least 1900, if not earlier. After this reorganisation, war planning and strategic matters were transferred to the newly created Naval Mobilisation Department and the NID reverted to the position it held prior to 1887—an intelligence collection and collation organisation.

In 1912 the division was established as a component part of the new Admiralty War Staff organisation when that body was abolished in 1917 it continued as a division of the new Admiralty Naval Staff until 1964 when the Admiralty Department was abolished.

===World War I===
During World War I the NID was responsible for the Royal Navy&#x27;s highly successful cryptographic efforts, &quot;Room 40&quot;. The interception and decoding of the Zimmermann Telegram played a role in bringing the United States into the War. It has described as the most significant intelligence triumph for Britain during World War I, and one of the first occasions on which a piece of signals intelligence influenced world events.

===World War II===
Naval Ultra messages were handled differently from Army and Air Force Ultra because the Admiralty was an operational HQ and could give orders during a battle; while the Imperial General Staff (Army) and Air Staff would give commanders general orders such as, &quot;clear the enemy out of Africa&quot; without telling them how to do it. Hence verbatim translations of naval decodes were sent by Hut 4 to the NID and nowhere else (except for some naval intelligence sent directly from Bletchley Park to Commanders-in-Chief in the Mediterranean).

Hut 8 which decrypted Enigma messages for Hut 4 to translate and analyse had less information for Ultra as the Kriegsmarine operated Enigma more securely than the German Army and Air Force. Hut 4 also broke various hand cyphers and some Italian naval traffic.

The NID also initiated the 30th Assault Unit whose role was information gathering, reconnaissance and sabotage. Members of the unit, including Ralph Izzard, are acknowledged as inspirations for Ian Fleming (who also worked for the NID) in the creation of his fictional spy, James Bond.

==Geographical section==
The Geographical Section of the Naval Intelligence Division, Naval Staff, Admiralty, produced a series of Geographical Handbooks from 1917 to 1922 to provide information for the British Armed Forces. The &quot;Naval Intelligence Division Geographical Handbook Series&quot; was produced between 1941 and 1946 to provide information for the British Armed Forces.

==Amalgamation==
In 1965, the three service intelligence departments were amalgamated in the new Defence Intelligence Service at the Ministry of Defence.

However, well before the mid-1990s another Royal Naval branch existed, namely the Directorate of Naval Security &amp; Integrated Contingency Planning (DNSyICP), which is based at HM Naval Base Portsmouth under the staff command of the Second Sea Lord &amp; C-in-C Naval Home Command.

==Directors of Naval Intelligence==
Directors of Naval Intelligence included:
* Rear-Admiral Lewis Beaumont, 1895–1899
* Rear-Admiral Reginald Custance, 1899–1902
* Rear-Admiral Prince Louis of Battenberg, 1902–1905
* Rear-Admiral Charles Ottley, 1905–1907

<text>The Lielupe ( in Latvian literally: &quot;Large River&quot;, , ) is a river in central Latvia. Its length is (the length would reach if the Mēmele River were counted as part of the Lielupe). The surface area of its drainage basin is . The average fall of the Lielupe is about () and its average flow is , although a maximum of has been reached during floods.

== Physical geography ==

The Lielupe begins at the confluence of the Mēmele and Mūsa rivers near Bauska. For the upper part of its course, the river flows through a dolomite valley with a few small rapids, until it reaches Mežotne, where it widens and deepens over the flat Zemgale Plain. For many years the Lielupe would frequently overflow its shallow banks and flood surrounding fields and villages, particularly during the spring thaw. Today many parts of the Lielupe&#x27;s banks are contained with earthen dikes to prevent disastrous floods. Much of the Lielupe is covered in river grasses. At its lower reaches, the river flows parallel to the coastline of the Gulf of Riga; the city of Jūrmala stretches for almost between the river and the sea. Eventually the Lielupe flows into the Baltic Sea, while the Buļļupe branch () flows into the Daugava River. The modern mouth of the river appeared in 1755. Before then the Buļļupe was the Lielupe&#x27;s main channel.

About 50-55% of the water discharge of the river is from melted snow. The Lielupe is navigable for a range of , the longest continuous range among Latvian rivers. Municipalities along the river include Bauska, Mežotne, Jelgava, Kalnciems, Jūrmala and Riga.

The Lielupe also gives its name to a railway station and a neighbourhood in the city of Jūrmala.

<doc id="256075" wikidata="Q1296168" url="?curid=256075" title="Effi Briest">
<text>Effi Briest () is a realist novel by Theodor Fontane. Published in book form in 1895, &quot;Effi Briest&quot; marks both a watershed and a climax in the poetic realism of literature. It can be thematically compared to other novels on 19th-century marriage from a female perspective, such as &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; and &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;, which are also adultery tragedies.

==Plot introduction==
Seventeen-year-old Effi Briest, the daughter of a German aristocrat, is married off to 38-year-old Baron Geert von Innstetten, who courted her mother Luise and was spurned for his status, which he has now improved.

==Plot summary==
Effi Briest, who is attracted by social status, moves to the fictional Pomeranian port of Kessin (loosely modeled on Swinemünde). Her husband Innstetten is away for weeks at a time, and Effi, who is shunned by local nobles, finds but one friend. Her suspicions that their house may be haunted are not entirely laid to rest by Innstetten. When she says there may be a ghost, he derides her fears. The scorn he would bear if people knew of her terror would stall his career; hence his angry reply.

When Major Crampas arrives, Effi cannot help relishing his attentions despite Crampas being a married womaniser, and their love is consummated. Her husband looks down on Crampas, whom he finds a lewd philanderer with cavalier views of law. Crampas views Innstetten as a patronising prig.

Years later, Effi&#x27;s daughter Annie is growing up, and the family moves to Berlin due to Innstetten&#x27;s ascent. All seems well, but when Effi&#x27;s letters to Crampas are found by her husband, he decides to divorce her. He gets custody of Annie and influences her to disdain Effi. When Effi and Annie meet briefly some years later, it is clear the two are estranged, and Effi stops trying to establish a good relationship with Annie.

The Briests disown Effi, thinking it ill behooves them to deal with someone who tarnished their name. Innstetten tells Crampas he wants to duel; he agrees and is killed by Innstetten. But the halcyon days of Innstetten&#x27;s past life are over, and career success fails to delight him.

Effi&#x27;s parents take her back when she becomes the victim of nervous disorder, depression. Facing death, she asks Luise to tell Innstetten about her regrets and willingness to forgive him. Her death forms a rather symmetrical ending that matches the novel&#x27;s start. In the end scene, her parents vaguely concede guilt for her fate without daring to question the social canons that sparked the tragedy, citing the German maxim, &quot;That would be too wide a field&quot; (&quot;ein weites Feld&quot;).

==Background==
Manfred von Ardenne’s grandmother Baroness Elisabeth von Ardenne (née Baroness Elisabeth von Plotho) is said to have inspired Effi Briest.

The youngest of five children, Elisabeth was born in Zerben (currently part of Elbe-Parey) in 1853. Her easeful life was cut short by her meeting Armand Léon von Ardenne (1848–1919). She is said to have shown little interest in Ardenne; having rejected his first proposal, she changed her mind during the Franco-Prussian War, which left Ardenne injured. They became engaged on 7 February 1871 and wed in 1873.

His ascent made them move to Düsseldorf in the summer of 1881, where they met the famed and unhappily married judge Emil Hartwich (1843–1886). Elisabeth and Hartwich had much in common including their love of theatre. Despite risk of discovery, they did not cease corresponding when the Ardennes went back to Berlin on 1 October 1884.

Hartwich would come irregularly. During the summer of 1886, which Hartwich spent in Berlin, he and Elisabeth chose to marry each other. But Ardenne saw his secret suspicions confirmed when he found Elisabeth&#x27;s and Hartwich&#x27;s year-long correspondence. He filed for divorce and dueled Hartwich on 27 November 1886, drawing strong coverage. Hartwich died from his injuries on 1 December. Ardenne was sentenced to two years in prison but his term was reduced to 18 days.

His divorce on 15 March 1887 gave him full custody of his children, and his ex-wife set about caring for the deprived and disabled. Her name was temporarily removed from the family chronicles. In 1904, her daughter Margot was the first to try to find her; her son Egmont saw her in 1909. She died in Lindau on 4 February 1952 and was interred in a Berlin grave of honor ().

===Fiction and truth===
Fontane changed myriad details so as not to imperil privacy of those involved. He also made changes for the sake of drama. Elisabeth married at age 19 instead of 17, with Ardenne being five, not twenty, years her senior. She fell in love with Hartwich after twelve years—not twelve months—of marriage, and Ardenne did not kill her paramour years after the dalliance, but when they were still courting. Fontane knew that Elisabeth did not retreat as Effi did; instead, she began to work and devote herself to the needy. Elisabeth died at 98 (in fact vastly outliving Fontaine himself); Effi dies at 29 in the novel.

Some dates were altered, too. Effi marries on 3 October; Elisabeth wed on 1 January. Effi bears Annie on 3 July, while Margot&#x27;s birthday was 5 November; Egmont&#x27;s was 4 January. Elisabeth was born on 26 October; Effi has an August birthday.

==Legacy==
Today &quot;Effi Briest&quot; is widely discussed and taught at German schools. It has greatly influenced German writers, including Thomas Mann in his creation of &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot;. Mann said that if one had to reduce one&#x27;s library to six novels, &quot;Effi Briest&quot; would have to be one of them.

<doc id="256076" wikidata="Q326909" url="?curid=256076" title="Buddenbrooks">
<text>Buddenbrooks () is a 1901 novel by Thomas Mann, chronicling the decline of a wealthy north German merchant family over the course of four generations, incidentally portraying the manner of life and mores of the Hanseatic bourgeoisie in the years from 1835 to 1877. Mann drew deeply from the history of his own family, the Mann family of Lübeck, and their milieu.

It was Mann&#x27;s first novel, published when he was twenty-six years old. With the publication of the second edition in 1903, &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; became a major literary success. Its English translation by Helen Tracy Lowe-Porter was published in 1924. The work led to a Nobel Prize in Literature for Mann in 1929; although the Nobel award generally recognises an author&#x27;s body of work, the Swedish Academy&#x27;s citation for Mann identified &quot;his great novel &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot;&quot; as the principal reason for his prize. In 1993, a new English translation by John E. Woods was published. In 2023, Damion Searls published a translation of &quot;A Day in the Life of Hanno Buddenbrook&quot;, which he explained &quot;was originally part 11, chapters 2 and 3, of Mann&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot;, but he considered it something of an independent work... The title is provided by me&quot;. A third English translation of &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; is reportedly in the works.

Mann began writing the novel in October 1897, when he was twenty-two years old, and completed it three years later, in July 1900. It was published in 1901. His objective was to write a novel on the conflicts between the worlds of the businessman and the artist, presented as a family saga, continuing in the realist tradition of such 19th-century works as Stendhal&#x27;s &quot;Le Rouge et le Noir&quot; (1830; &quot;The Red and the Black&quot;). &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; is his most enduringly popular novel, especially in Germany, where it has been cherished for its intimate portrait of 19th-century German bourgeois life.

Before &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; Mann had written only short stories, which had been collected under the title &quot;Der kleine Herr Friedemann&quot; (1898, &quot;Little Herr Friedemann&quot;). They portrayed spiritually challenged figures who struggle to find happiness in (or at the margins of) bourgeois society. Similar themes appear in the &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot;, but in a fully developed style that already reflects the mastery of narrative, subtle irony of tone, and rich character descriptions of Mann&#x27;s mature fiction.

The exploration of decadence in the novel reflects the influence of Schopenhauer&#x27;s &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; (1818, 1844) on the young Mann. The Buddenbrooks of successive generations experience a gradual decline of their finances and family ideals, finding happiness increasingly elusive as values change and old hierarchies are challenged by Germany&#x27;s rapid industrialisation. The characters who subordinate their personal happiness to the welfare of the family firm encounter reverses, as do those who do not.

The city where the Buddenbrooks live shares so many street names and other details with Mann&#x27;s native town of Lübeck that the identification is unmistakable, although the novel makes no mention of the name. The young author was condemned for writing a scandalous, defamatory &quot;roman à clef&quot; about (supposedly) recognisable personages. Mann defended the right of a writer to use material from his own experience.

The years covered in the novel were marked by major political and military developments that reshaped Germany, such as the Revolutions of 1848, the Austro-Prussian War, and the establishment of the German Empire. Historic events nevertheless generally remain in the background, having no direct bearing on the lives of the characters.

==Plot summary==
In 1835, the wealthy and respected Buddenbrooks, a family of grain merchants, invite their friends and relatives to dinner in their new home in Lübeck. The family consists of patriarch Johann Buddenbrook Jr. and his wife Antoinette; their son Johann III (&quot;Jean&quot;) and his wife Elizabeth, and the latter&#x27;s three school-age children, sons Thomas and Christian, and daughter Antonie (&quot;Tony&quot;). They have several servants, most notably Ida Jungmann, whose job is to care for the children. During the evening, a letter arrives from Gotthold, estranged son of the elder Johann and half-brother of the younger. The elder Johann disapproves of Gotthold&#x27;s life choices, and ignores the letter. Johann III and Elizabeth later have another daughter, Klara.

As the older children grow up, their personalities begin to show. Diligent and industrious Thomas seems likely to inherit the business some day. By contrast, Christian is more interested in entertainment and leisure. Tony has grown quite conceited and spurns an advance from the son of another up-and-coming family, Herman Hagenström. Herman takes it in stride, but Tony bears a grudge against him for the rest of her life. The elder Johann and Antoinette die, and the younger Johann takes over the business, and gives Gotthold his fair share of the inheritance. The half-brothers will never be close, though, and Gotthold&#x27;s three spinster daughters continue to resent Johann&#x27;s side of the family, and delight in their misfortune over the coming years. Thomas goes to Amsterdam to study, while Tony goes to boarding school. After finishing school, Tony remains lifelong friends with her former teacher, Therese &quot;Sesemi&quot; Weichbrodt.

An obsequious businessman, Bendix Grünlich, of Hamburg, introduces himself to the family, and Tony dislikes him on sight. To avoid him, she takes a vacation in Travemünde, a Baltic resort northeast of Lübeck, where she meets Morten Schwarzkopf, a medical student in whom she is interested romantically. In the end, though, she yields to pressure from her father, and marries Grünlich, against her better judgment, in 1846. She gives birth to a daughter, Erika. Later, though, it is revealed that Grünlich had been cooking his books to hide unpayable debt, and had married Tony solely on the hopes that Johann would bail him out. Johann refuses, and takes Tony and Erika home with him instead. Grünlich goes bankrupt, and Tony divorces him in 1850.

Christian begins traveling, going as far as Valparaíso, Chile. At the same time, Thomas comes home, and Johann puts him to work at the business. During the unrest in 1848, Johann is able to calm an angry mob with a speech. He and Elizabeth become increasingly religious in their twilight years. Johann dies in 1855, and Thomas takes over the business. Christian comes home and initially goes to work for his brother, but he has neither the interest nor the aptitude for commerce. He complains of bizarre illnesses and gains a reputation as a fool, a drunk, a womanizer, and a teller of tall tales. Thomas, coming to despise his brother, sends him away, to protect his own and his business&#x27;s reputation. Later, Thomas marries Gerda Arnoldsen, daughter of a wealthy Amsterdam merchant, violin virtuoso and Tony&#x27;s former schoolmate.

Klara marries Sievert Tiburtius, a pastor from Riga, but she dies of tuberculosis without any issue. Tony marries her second husband, Alois Permaneder, a provincial but honest hops merchant from Munich. However, once he has her dowry in hand, he invests the money and retires, intending to live off his interest and dividends, while spending his days in his local bar. Tony is unhappy in Munich, where her family name impresses no one, where her favorite seafoods are unavailable at any price in the days before refrigeration, where even the dialect is noticeably different from her own. She gives birth to another baby, but it dies on the same day it is born, leaving her heartbroken. Tony later leaves Permaneder after she discovers him drunkenly trying to grope the maid. She and Erika return to Lübeck. Somewhat surprisingly, Permaneder writes her a letter apologizing for his behavior, agreeing not to challenge the divorce, and returning the dowry.

In the early 1860s, Thomas becomes a father and a senator. He builds an ostentatious mansion and soon regrets it, as maintaining the new house proves to be a considerable drain on his time and money. The old house, now too big for the number of people living in it, falls into disrepair. Thomas suffers many setbacks and losses in his business. His hard work keeps the business afloat, but it is clearly taking its toll on him. Thomas throws a party to celebrate the business&#x27;s centennial in 1868, during which he receives news that one of his risky business deals has resulted in yet another loss.

Erika, now grown up, marries Hugo Weinschenk, a manager at a fire insurance company, and delivers a daughter, Elizabeth. Weinschenk is arrested for insurance fraud and is sent to prison. Thomas&#x27;s son, Johann IV (&quot;Hanno&quot;), is born a weak, sickly runt and remains one as he grows. He is withdrawn, melancholic, easily upset and frequently bullied by other children. His only friend, Kai Mölln, is a dishevelled young count, a remnant of the medieval aristocracy, who lives with his eccentric father outside Lübeck. Johann does poorly in school, but he discovers an aptitude for music, clearly inherited from his mother. This helps him bond with his uncle Christian, but Thomas is disappointed by his son.

In 1871, the elder Elizabeth dies of pneumonia. Tony, Erika, and little Elizabeth sadly move out of their old house, which is then sold, at a disappointing price, to Herman Hagenström, who is now a successful businessman himself. Christian expresses his desire to marry Aline, a woman of questionable morals with three illegitimate children, one of whom may or may not be Christian&#x27;s. Thomas, who controls their mother&#x27;s inheritance, forbids him. Thomas sends Johann to Travemünde to improve his health. Johann loves the peace and solitude of the resort, but returns home no stronger than before. Weinschenk is released from prison, a disgraced and broken man. He soon abandons his wife and daughter and leaves Germany, never to return.

Thomas, becoming increasingly depressed and exhausted by the demands of keeping up his faltering business, devotes ever more time and attention to his appearance, and begins to suspect his wife may be cheating on him. In 1874, he takes a vacation with Christian and a few of his old friends to Travemünde during the off season, where they discuss life, religion, business and the unification of Germany. In 1875, he collapses and dies after a visit to his dentist. His complete despair and lack of confidence in his son and sole heir are obvious in his will, in which he directed that his business be liquidated. All the assets, including the mansion, are sold at distress prices, and faithful servant Ida is dismissed.

Christian gains control of his own share of his father&#x27;s inheritance and then marries Aline, but his illnesses and bizarre behavior get him admitted to an insane asylum, leaving Aline free to dissipate Christian&#x27;s money. Johann still hates school, and he passes his classes only by cheating. His health and constitution are still weak, and it is hinted that he might be homosexual. Except for his friend Count Kai, he is held in contempt by everyone outside his immediate family, even his pastor. In 1877, he takes ill with typhoid fever and soon dies. His mother, Gerda, returns home to Amsterdam, leaving an embittered Tony, her daughter Erika and granddaughter Elizabeth (accompanied in the table by their adopted cousin Tilda and the three Gotthold&#x27;s daughters) as the only remnants of the once proud Buddenbrook family, with only the elderly and increasingly infirm Therese Weichbrodt to offer any friendship or moral support. 
Facing destitution, they cling to their wavering belief that they may be reunited with their family in the afterlife, a wavering that precisely the hunched and little Mrs. Weichbrodt tries to dispel with her last encouraging words of conviction.

==Major themes==
One of the more famous aspects of Thomas Mann&#x27;s prose style can be seen in the use of leitmotifs. Derived from his admiration for the operas of Richard Wagner, in the case of &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; an example can be found in the description of the color – blue and yellow, respectively – of the skin and the teeth of the characters. Each such description alludes to different states of health, personality and even the destiny of the characters. Rotting teeth are also a symbol of decay and decadence because it implies indulging in too many cavity-causing foods. An example of this would be Hanno&#x27;s cup of hot chocolate at breakfast.

Aspects of Thomas Mann&#x27;s own personality are manifest in the two main male representatives of the third and the fourth generations of the fictional family: Thomas Buddenbrook and his son Hanno Buddenbrook. It should not be considered a coincidence that Mann shared the same first name with one of them. Thomas Buddenbrook reads a chapter of Schopenhauer&#x27;s &quot;The World as Will and Idea&quot;, and the character of Hanno Buddenbrook escapes from real-life worries into the realm of music, Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; in particular. (Wagner himself was of bourgeois descent and decided to dedicate himself to art.) In this sense both Buddenbrooks reflect a conflict lived by the author: departure from a conventional bourgeois life to pursue an artistic one, although without rejecting bourgeois ethics.

In any case, a central theme of Thomas Mann&#x27;s novels, the conflict between art and business, is already a dominant force in this work. Music also plays a major role: Hanno Buddenbrook, like his mother, tends to be an artist and musician, and not a person of commerce like his father.

==Literary significance and criticism==
Lübeck&#x27;s patrician hanseatic families resented Mann&#x27;s daring to describe their caste with some mockery, as they at least felt about it. Nonetheless, he did not intend to write an epic against contemporary aristocratic society and its conventions. On the contrary, Mann often sympathizes with its Protestant ethics and criticizes with irony and detachment. When &quot;Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus&quot; (1905, &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot;) by Max Weber was published, Mann recognised its affinities with his novel.

Before writing the novel, Mann conducted extensive research in order to depict with precise detail the conditions of the times and even the mundane aspects of the lives of his characters. In particular, his cousin Marty provided him with substantial information on the economics of Lübeck, including grain prices and the city&#x27;s economic decline. Mann carried out financial analyses to present the economic information provided in the book accurately. Accurate information through extensive research was a feature of Mann&#x27;s other novels as well. Some characters in &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; speak in the Low German of northern Germany.

In the conversations appearing in the early parts of the book, many of the characters switch back and forth between German and French. The French appears in the original within Mann&#x27;s German text, similar to the practice of Tolstoy in &quot;War and Peace&quot;. The bilingual characters are of the older generation, who were already adults during the Napoleonic Wars; in later parts of the book, with the focus shifting to the family&#x27;s younger generation against the background of Germany moving towards unification and assertion of its new role as a major European power, the use of French by the characters diminishes.

All occurrences in the lives of the characters are seen by the narrator and the family members in relation to the family trade business: the sense of duty and destiny accompanying it as well as the economic consequences that events bring. Through births, marriages, and deaths, the business becomes almost a fetish or a religion, especially for some characters, notably Thomas and his sister Tony. The treatment of the female main character Tony Buddenbrook in the novel resembles the 19th-century realists (Flaubert&#x27;s &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; and Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;), but from a more ironic and less tragic point of view.

Mann&#x27;s emotional description of the Frau Consul&#x27;s death has been noted as a significant and eloquent literary treatment of death and the subject&#x27;s self-awareness of the death process.

William Faulkner considered it to be the greatest novel of the 20th century.

==Thomas Buddenbrook and Schopenhauer==

In part 10, chapter 5, Thomas Mann described Thomas Buddenbrook&#x27;s encounter with Arthur Schopenhauer&#x27;s philosophy. When he read the second volume of Schopenhauer&#x27;s &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;, Thomas Buddenbrook was strongly affected by chapter 41, entitled &quot;On Death and Its Relation to the Indestructibility of Our Inner Nature&quot;. From this chapter&#x27;s influence, he had such thoughts as &quot;Where shall I be when I am dead? ...I shall be in all those who have ever, do ever, or ever shall say &#x27;I&#x27; &quot; ...&quot;Who, what, how could I be if I were not—if this my external self, my consciousness, did not cut me off from those who are not I?&quot;...&quot;soon will that in me which loves you be free and be in and with you – in and with you all.&quot; &quot;I shall live...Blind, thoughtless, pitiful eruption of the urging will!&quot; Schopenhauer had written that &quot;Egoism really consists in man&#x27;s restricting all reality to his own person, in that he imagines he lives in this alone, and not in others. Death teaches him something better, since it abolishes this person, so that man&#x27;s true nature, that is his will, will henceforth live only in other individuals.&quot; According to this teaching, there really is no self to lose when death occurs. What is usually considered to be the self is really the same in all people and animals, at all times and everywhere. Irvin D. Yalom had a character in his novel describe it as follows:
However, a few days after reading Schopenhauer, &quot;his middle-class instincts&quot; brought Thomas Buddenbrook back to his former belief in a personal Father God and in Heaven, the home of departed individual souls. There could be no consolation if conscious personal identity is lost at death. The novel ends with the surviving characters&#x27; firm consoling belief that there will be a large family reunion, in the afterlife, of all the individual Buddenbrook personalities.

==Film and television adaptations==
A silent film version directed by Gerhard Lamprecht was filmed in Lübeck and released in 1923.

Alfred Weidenmann directed the two-part television film &quot;The Buddenbrooks&quot; (1959), starring Liselotte Pulver, Nadja Tiller, Hansjörg Felmy, Hanns Lothar, Lil Dagover and Werner Hinz.

Franz Peter Wirth directed an 11 episode television series (1979). It was filmed in Gdańsk, which had been less damaged by war than Lübeck was.

Another film version, starring Armin Mueller-Stahl, was released in 2008.

<doc id="256077" wikidata="Q5139112" url="?curid=256077" title="Coca eradication">
<text>Coca eradication is a strategy promoted by the United States government starting in 1961 as part of its &quot;war on drugs&quot; to eliminate the cultivation of coca, a plant whose leaves are not only traditionally used by indigenous cultures but also, in modern society, in the manufacture of cocaine. The strategy was adopted in place of running educational campaigns against drug usage. The prohibitionist strategy is being pursued in the coca-growing regions of Colombia (Plan Colombia), Peru, and formerly Bolivia, where it is highly controversial because of its environmental, health and socioeconomic impact. Furthermore, indigenous cultures living in the &quot;Altiplano&quot;, such as the Aymaras, use the coca leaf (which they dub the &quot;millenary leaf&quot;) in many of their cultural traditions, notably for its medicinal qualities in alleviating the feeling of hunger, fatigue and headaches symptomatic of altitude sicknesses. The growers of coca are named &quot;Cocaleros&quot; and part of the coca production for traditional use is legal in Peru, Bolivia and Chile.

==Environmental impact==
Plots denuded of coca plants by mechanical means (burning or cutting) or chemical herbicides, such as glyphosate, are abandoned and cause serious problems with erosion in seasonal rains. Because of the continuous high demand for coca, once a plot is destroyed the planters simply move further into the forest, clearing new lands for coca production. It is this vicious cycle of unsustainable cultivation-eradication that has caused the environment in coca producing zones to suffer substantial decline.

Aerial spraying of glyphosate herbicide, one of the most controversial methods of coca eradication, has taken place in Colombia exclusively because of that government&#x27;s willingness to cooperate with the United States in the militarized eradication of coca after signing Plan Colombia in 2000. In many cases the spraying is carried out by American contractors, such as DynCorp, using planes and helicopters to spray glyphosate on coca plantations. Aerial spraying has been repeatedly condemned by human rights and environmental activists because of its effect on human populations and local soil and water systems. In December 2000, Dutch journalist Marjon van Royen found that &quot;because the chemical is sprayed in Colombia from planes on inhabited areas, there have been consistent health complaints [in humans]. Burning eyes, dizziness and respiratory problems being most frequently reported.&quot; In some areas, 80 percent of the children of the indigenous community fell sick with skin rashes, fever, diarrhoea and eye infections. Because the glyphosate is sprayed from the air, there is a much higher chance of human error when spraying suspected illegal coca plantations. In many cases the wrong fields are sprayed, resulting in not only a total loss of the farmer&#x27;s crop- but the loss of that field altogether as nothing will grow where the herbicide has been sprayed. Though official documentation of the health effects of glyphosate spraying in Colombia are virtually non-existent, neighbouring Ecuador has conducted studies to determine the cause of mysterious illnesses amongst people living along the border of Colombia and has since demanded that no aerial sprayings occur within 10 km of the border because of the damages caused to the people, animals and environment in that area. In 2015, Colombia announced a ban on using glyphosate in these programs due to concerns about human toxicity of the chemical.

In addition, the U.S. has also been involved in the development of the fungus &quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot; to wipe out coca. In 2000, the Congress of the United States approved use of &quot;Fusarium&quot; as a biological control agent to kill coca crops in Colombia (and another fungus to kill opium poppies in Afghanistan), but these plans were canceled by then-President Clinton, who was concerned that the unilateral use of a biological agent would be perceived by the rest of the world as biological warfare. The Andean nations have since banned its use throughout the region. (The use of biological agents to kill crops may be illegal under the Biological Weapons Convention of 1975.)

On June 25, 2003, the Superior Administrative Court of the Colombian department of Cundinamarca ordered a stop to the spraying of glyphosate herbicides until the government complies with the environmental management plan for the eradication program. It also mandated a series of studies to protect public health and the environment. The Colombian State Council, the country&#x27;s maximum administrative authority, later overruled the court&#x27;s decision to stop fumigations.

Recently, Boliviana negra, a glyphosate-resistant type of coca plant has been found.

==Socioeconomic impact==
In the of Peru, Bolivia, and northern Argentina, coca has been consumed (by chewing and brewing in infusion) for thousands of years as a stimulant and cure for altitude sickness; it also has symbolic value. The sale and consumption of coca (but not pure cocaine) is legal and legitimate in these countries.

With the growth of the Colombian drug cartels in the 1980s, coca leaf became a valuable agricultural commodity, particularly in Peru and Bolivia, where the quality of coca is higher than in Colombia. To supply the foreign markets, the cartels expanded the cultivation to areas where coca was not a traditional crop. Many poor campesinos, driven from the central highlands by lack of land or loss of jobs, migrated to the lowlands and valleys of the eastern Andes, where they turned to the cultivation of coca.

To counter this development, the U.S. government, through its foreign aid agency USAID, has promoted a policy of crop substitution, whereby coca cultivation is replaced by coffee, banana, pineapple, palm heart, and other crops suitable for a tropical climate. However; many remote coca-growing areas lack the infrastructure to get such perishable products to market on time. Coca on the other hand stores well and is easily transportable. The price of coca has remained high and in many cases remains a more attractive crop to farmers than these alternatives.

Despite these obstacles, many farmers have embraced alternative crops. In 2006, Bolivia, as a result of alternative development programs, exported US$28 million of banana, US$1.9 million of pineapple, and US$7.0 million of palm heart. These industries now employ more than 20,000 people in the Chapare region.

==Geopolitical issues==
Given the above-mentioned considerations, many critics of coca eradication believe the fundamental goal of the U.S. government is to constrict the flow of income to the Colombian Marxist rebel movement, FARC, which is heavily funded by the illegal drug trade, rather than combating drugs &quot;per se&quot;. Few if any such critics have anything favorable to say about the illicit drug trade, but they point out that under the current coca eradication policies, poor campesinos bear the brunt of efforts to combat it, while North American and European chemical companies (which supply chemicals needed in the manufacture of cocaine) and banks (which annually launder hundreds of billions of dollars in illegal revenues) continue to profit from the trade. (Although it is illegal in the United States for banks to hold funds from drug cartels—such as FARC—that have been designated as foreign terrorist organizations.)

 of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, a treaty promulgated with U.S. backing in 1961, states that &quot;The Parties shall so far as possible enforce the uprooting of all coca bushes which grow wild. They shall destroy the coca bushes if illegally cultivated.&quot;

The US-based Drug Enforcement Administration, along with local governments, has frequently clashed with &quot;cocaleros&quot; in attempts to eradicate coca across the Andes. This map shows the Chapare region in Bolivia, which has historically been heavily targeted for coca eradication. Human rights NGOs such as Human Rights Watch have accused the US of human rights abuses in the &quot;coca war&quot;.

Meanwhile, the US-based Stepan Company is authorized by the Federal Government to import and process the coca plant which it obtains mainly from Peru and, to a lesser extent, Bolivia. Besides producing the coca flavoring agent for Coca-Cola, Stepan Company extracts cocaine from the coca leaves, which it sells to Mallinckrodt, a St. Louis, Missouri pharmaceutical manufacturer that is the only company in the United States licensed to purify cocaine for medicinal use.

==Results==
At the start of 2003, there were 1,740 km2 of coca in worldwide cultivation, and Colombia represented more than 60% of that total. Critics of the Colombian eradication program had predicted that it would lead to higher coca production in Peru and Bolivia. However, in November 2003, the US Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) claimed the area planted with coca in Peru and Bolivia combined fell by 35 km2 in the year up to June, which would suggest that the crop eradication program in neighboring Colombia had not driven production over the borders. According to ONDCP estimates, the area cultivated with coca in Bolivia rose from 244 km2 in 2002 to 284.5 km2 in June 2003, but this increase was more than offset in Peru, where the area fell from 366 km2 to 311.5 km2.

The U.S. figures were very different from preliminary estimates in September 2003 by the head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime in Colombia, which indicated that output in Peru and Bolivia may have risen by as much 21%, or 150 km2 that year. The White House office said its estimate was based on sampling from high resolution satellite imagery. The United Nations used a different technique and had not yet put out any formal estimate for 2003.

A March 2005 report by the ONDCP indicated that despite record aerial spraying of over 1,300 km2 of coca in Colombia in 2004, the total area under coca cultivation remained &quot;statistically unchanged&quot; at 1,140 km2. In response to the report, the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), an NGO that monitors the impact of US foreign policy in Latin America, observed that the aerial spraying strategy appeared to have hit its limits. According to WOLA, the new ONDCP data suggested a continued &quot;balloon effect&quot; as aggressive spraying in some areas has not deterred new cultivation elsewhere. The WOLA Senior Associate for Drug Policy commented, &quot;The stable cultivation in 2004 throws into doubt US officials’ predictions of a major impact on US drug prices and purity.&quot; Regardless, Colombian President Álvaro Uribe vowed to press ahead with the U.S.-financed fumigation of coca crops.

Official estimates of coca cultivation in Peru for 2005 have yet to be released, but the State Department&#x27;s own reporting suggests that cultivation in Peru has increased.

In Bolivia, there has been a decrease in clashes since 2004, when Evo Morales and former President Carlos Mesa struck a deal allowing the Chapare region to legally grow a limited amount of coca, in addition to the already legal Yungas region.

In 2006 the Colombian government destroyed around 730 square kilometres, reaching new records in coca plant destruction. The Colombian government planned to destroy around 500 km2 of coca plants in 2007, which would leave only around 200 km2 left. The Colombian government planned to destroy the remaining coca gradually over the following years.

<doc id="256084" wikidata="Q534028" url="?curid=256084" title="Woodhenge">
<text>Woodhenge is a Neolithic Class II henge and timber circle monument within the Stonehenge World Heritage Site in Wiltshire, England. It is northeast of Stonehenge, in Durrington parish, just north of the town of Amesbury.

==Discovery==
Woodhenge was believed to be identified from an aerial photograph taken by pilot and World War I veteran Gilbert Insall, VC, in 1926, during the same period that an aerial archaeology survey of Wessex by Alexander Keiller and O. G. S. Crawford (Archaeology Officer for the Ordnance Survey) was being undertaken. Although some sources attribute the identification of the henge to Crawford, he credits the discovery to Insall.

In fact, the site had been found in the early 19th century, when it was described as an earthwork and thought to be a disc barrow. It was originally called &quot;Dough Cover.&quot; A professional excavation of the site was undertaken between 1926 and 1929 by Maud Cunnington and Ben Cunnington. They confirmed that it was a henge.

==Date==
Pottery from the excavation was identified as being consistent with the grooved ware style of the middle Neolithic, although later beaker sherds were also found. Thus, the structure was probably built during the period of cultural similarities commonly known as the Beaker. The Bell Beaker culture spans both the Late Neolithic and Britain&#x27;s early Bronze Age and includes both the distinctive &quot;bell beaker&quot; type ceramic vessels for which the cultural grouping is known, and other local styles of pottery from the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age.

While construction of the timber monument was probably earlier, the ditch has been dated to between 2470 and 2000 BCE, which would be about the same time as, or slightly later than, construction of the stone circle at Stonehenge. Radiocarbon dating of artefacts shows that the site was still in use around 1800 BC.

==Structure==

The site consists of six concentric oval rings of postholes, the outermost being about wide. They are surrounded first by a single flat-bottomed ditch, deep and up to wide, and finally by an outer bank, about wide and high. With an overall diameter measuring (including bank and ditch), the site had a single entrance to the north-east.

At the centre of the rings was a crouched inhumation of a child which Cunnington interpreted as a dedicatory sacrifice, its skull having been split. Subsequent theories have indicated that the weight and pressure of the soil over the years could have caused the skull to fragment. After excavation, the remains were taken to London, where they were destroyed during The Blitz, making further examination impossible. Cunnington also found a crouched inhumation of a teenager within a grave dug in the eastern section of the ditch, opposite the entrance.

Most of the 168 post holes held wooden posts, although Cunnington found evidence that a pair of standing stones may have been placed between the second and third post hole rings. Excavations in 2006 indicated that there were at least five standing stones on the site, arranged in a &quot;cove&quot;. The deepest post holes measured up to and are believed to have held posts which reached as high as above ground. Those posts would have weighed up to 5 tons, and their arrangement was similar to that of the bluestones at Stonehenge. The positions of the postholes are currently marked with modern concrete posts – a simple and informative method of displaying the site.

Further comparisons with Stonehenge were quickly noticed by Cunnington: both have entrances oriented approximately to the midsummer sunrise, and the diameters of the timber circles at Woodhenge and the stone circles at Stonehenge are similar.

==Relationship with other monuments==

Over 40 years after the discovery of Woodhenge, another timber circle of comparable size was discovered in 1966, to the north. Known as the Southern Circle, it lies inside what came to be known as the Durrington Walls henge enclosure.

There are various theories about possible timber structures that might have stood on and about the site, and their purpose, but it is likely that the timbers were free-standing, rather than part of a roofed structure. For many years, the study of Stonehenge had overshadowed work on the understanding of Woodhenge. Recent ongoing investigations as part of the Stonehenge Riverside Project are now starting to cast new light on the site and on its relationship with neighbouring sites and Stonehenge.

Theories have emerged in which the sites may all be part of a layout in which the structures were linked by roads, and which incorporated the natural features of the River Avon. One of these paths, consisting of a series of wide parallel banks and ditches referred to as Stonehenge Avenue, crosses the ridge between the two sites that would otherwise make them both visible from one another, possibly connecting them physically as well as spiritually.

One suggestion is that the use of wood rather than stone may have held a special significance in the beliefs and practices involving the transformation between life and death, possibly separating the two sites into separate &quot;domains&quot;. These theories have been supported by findings of bones of butchered pigs exclusively at Woodhenge, showing evidence of feasting, leaving Stonehenge as a site only inhabited by ancestral spirits, not living people. These same possible representations (wood vs. stone) have also been seen in ritualistic megalithic sites on the island of Madagascar, at least 4,000 years after the erection of Woodhenge.

<text>Admiral Sir Barry Edward Domvile, (5 September 1878 – 13 August 1971) was a high-ranking Royal Navy officer who was interned during the Second World War for being a Nazi sympathiser. Throughout the 1930s, he expressed support for Germany&#x27;s Adolf Hitler as well as pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic sentiments. Domvile was implicated in a fascist plot against the British government in 1940.

==Naval career==
Domvile was the son of Admiral Sir Compton Domvile and followed his father into the Royal Navy in 1892. In 1912, he became Assistant Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence, and during the First World War he commanded the destroyer HMS &quot;Miranda&quot;, the destroyer HMS &quot;Tipperary&quot;, the cruiser HMS &quot;Centaur&quot; and then the cruiser HMS &quot;Curacoa&quot;. After the war, he became Director of Plans in 1920, and Chief of Staff to the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean in 1922 before becoming, in 1925, commanding officer of the battleship HMS &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;.

He served as Director of Naval Intelligence from 1927 to 1930, then commanded the Third Cruiser Squadron from 1931 to 1932, and served as President of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich from 1932 to 1934.

== Far-right activism ==
Domvile visited Germany in 1935 and was impressed by many aspects of the Nazi government. He was invited to attend the Nuremberg Rally of September 1936 as a guest of German Ambassador Joachim von Ribbentrop. Domvile became a council member of the Anglo-German Fellowship and founded the Anglo-German organisation The Link. He was also a member of the Right Club.

Domvile supported St. John Philby, the anti-Semitic British People&#x27;s Party candidate in the Hythe by-election of 1939, and visited Salzburg that summer, which attracted some criticism. Domvile was prominent in British far-right circles as the prospect of war seemed imminent in the late 1930s. His pro-Nazi and anti-war sympathies were expressed in an endorsement to the 1939 book &quot;The Case For Germany&quot;. His endorsement consisted of the comment in the preface:It is a great pleasure to me to introduce the public to Dr. Laurie&#x27;s valuable book on modern Germany.

He is best known to the world as a brilliant scientist, but he
has found time in the intervals of his work to pursue with ardour the task upon which every sensible member of the British and German races should be engaged – namely the establishment of good relations and a better understanding between these two great nations.

Dr. Laurie knows full well that this friendship is the keystone to peace in Europe – nay, in the whole world. He is one of the small group who founded the Association known as &quot;The Link&quot;, whose sole aim is to get Britons and Germans to know and understand one another better. He is one of the most zealous workers in this good cause in the country.

He writes of the National Socialist movement with knowledge and great sympathy. The particular value of this book lies in the fact that it is written by a foreigner, who cannot be accused of patriotic excess in his interpretation of the great work done by Herr Hitler and his associates. I recommend this volume with confidence to all people who are genuinely impressed with the desire to understand one of the greatest – and most bloodless – revolutions in history.

Admiral Sir Barry Domvile, 8 May 1939 

==Second World War==
In 1940, Domvile was implicated as a participant in a fascist plot, organized by Leigh Vaughan-Henry, against the British government. Vaughan-Henry was reported to have already organized 18 cells of 25 members each for the coup, which was intended to take place when Germany landed in Britain.

In June 1940, Domvile&#x27;s mistress, Olive Baker, was arrested for distributing leaflets promoting Reichssender Hamburg. She tried to commit suicide in prison and was sentenced to five years&#x27; imprisonment. Domvile himself was interned during Second World War under Defence Regulation 18B from 7 July 1940 to 29 July 1943. During his wartime captivity, he wrote an autobiographical memoir, &quot;From Admiral to Cabin Boy&quot;. It was first published in 1947 and republished in 2008.

==Later life==
Domvile largely faded from public life in the postwar period. He was a supporter of the League of Empire Loyalists but was never more than a peripheral figure in that group. He was a member of the National Front&#x27;s National Council from its formation in 1967 to his death in 1971.

<doc id="256089" wikidata="Q2267003" url="?curid=256089" title="Michael Eavis">
<text>Sir Athelstan Joseph Michael Eavis (born 17 October 1935) is an English dairy farmer and the co-creator of the Glastonbury Festival, which takes place at his farm in Pilton, Somerset.

== Personal life ==
Eavis was born in Pilton, Somerset on 17 October 1935, and grew up at Worthy Farm in the village. His father was a dairy farmer and also a Methodist local preacher, and his mother a school teacher. Eavis was educated at Wells Cathedral School, followed by the Thames Nautical Training College in Greenhithe, Kent, after which he joined the Union-Castle Line, part of the British Merchant Navy, as a trainee midshipman. His plan was to spend twenty years at sea, and return with a pension to help subsidise the income from the family farm.

After his father died when Eavis was 19, he inherited the family farm of and 60 cows. He worked at Mendip Colliery at Nettlebridge or New Rock colliery at Stratton-on-the-Fosse on the Somerset Coalfield for a couple of years to help supplement the income from the farm.

Eavis and his first wife Ruth had three children, Juliet, Rebecca and Jane, but divorced in 1964. He next married Jean Hayball, with whom he had a son, Patrick, and a daughter, Emily. Jean died of cancer in 1999, and Eavis has since married his third wife, Liz. In common with his parents and second wife, Eavis remains a practising Methodist, although he has also stated that he is &quot;not really bothered&quot; about the existence of God. He is a teetotaler and does not smoke.

== Glastonbury Festival ==
In 1969, Eavis and his second wife Jean visited the Bath Festival of Blues. Inspired by seeing the performance of Led Zeppelin, Eavis hosted the Pilton Pop Folk &amp; Blues Festival in 1970. The following year a free festival, Glastonbury Fayre, was organised by Andrew Kerr and associates. It later developed into Glastonbury Festival. 

In 2010, the festival&#x27;s 40th year, he appeared on the main stage at the festival with headline artist Stevie Wonder, to sing the chorus of the latter&#x27;s &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;.

== Political activity ==

Eavis has credited a number of influences for his political views, including traditions of nonconformity in his family, as well as his time as a miner, during which he was a member of the National Union of Mineworkers. During the early 1980s he was involved in establishing a local branch of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and subsequently agreed to make the Glastonbury Festival a fundraiser for CND, as it was from 1981 to 1987.

After recovering from stomach cancer, Eavis stood as a candidate for the Labour Party in the 1997 general election in Wells, polling 10,204 votes. In 2004, however, he suggested that disillusioned Labour voters should switch their vote to the Green Party in protest at the Iraq War, though he returned to supporting the Labour Party in 2010.

In 2005, Eavis was quoted in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as being a supporter of hunting. &quot;I don&#x27;t hunt myself, but I support the people who want to hunt. With all that&#x27;s going on in the world, it was outrageous to ban it.&quot; In 2006, he was appointed as President of the Somerset Chamber of commerce and Industry.

In 2011, Eavis was quoted as lamenting the decline in political activity associated with the Glastonbury Festival. He was guest editor of the &quot;Western Daily Press&quot; newspaper on Glastonbury&#x27;s &#x27;fallow&#x27; weekend, 23 June 2012.

Eavis invited Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to appear at the 2017 festival, introducing the Run the Jewels&#x27; set. Eavis supported Corbyn&#x27;s anti-nuclear and anti-austerity policies, saying &quot;he&#x27;s got something new and precious, and people are excited about it. He really is the hero of the hour.&quot;

== Charitable work ==

Eavis has apportioned profits from his Glastonbury Festival to support charitable causes, including local projects such as the restoration of the Tithe Barn, Pilton. In November 2008, during an appearance on the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, Eavis stated that the Festival could never lose its licence due to the contribution it makes to the local economy.

In 2009, Eavis starred in a short film to promote Somerset, commissioned by Inward Investment Agency Into Somerset.

Eavis served as vice-president (alongside Rebecca Pow MP) of Somerset Wildlife Trust until June 2018: he stepped down following an online petition criticising his support for badger culling. In response to the petition, Eavis claimed that signatories &quot;probably live in Kensington&quot; and had &quot;never seen a badger&quot;.

== Honours and tributes ==

Eavis holds honorary degrees from the University of Bath (Doctor of Arts &quot;honoris causa&quot;, 2004) and the University of Bristol (Master of Arts &quot;honoris causa&quot;, 2006). In the 2007 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for services to music. He was appointed Knight Bachelor in the 2024 New Year Honours for services to music and charity.

In 2009 Eavis was nominated by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the top 100 most influential people in the world. In 2012, he was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree from the University for the Creative Arts.

In 2015 train operator First Great Western named High Speed Train powercar 43026 &quot;Michael Eavis&quot;. After this was withdrawn, 802013 was named after him in April 2019.

Eavis was awarded the Freedom of the Town of Glastonbury on 3 May 2022.

In early 2024 Eavis was knighted at Windsor Castle, by the Princess Royal, for services to music and charity.

<doc id="256092" wikidata="Q196995" url="?curid=256092" title="Right to silence">
<text>The right to silence is a legal principle which guarantees any individual the right to refuse to answer questions from law enforcement officers or court officials. It is a legal right recognized, explicitly or by convention, in many of the world&#x27;s legal systems.

The right covers a number of issues centered on the right of the accused or the defendant to refuse to comment or provide an answer when questioned, either prior to or during legal proceedings in a court of law. This can be the right to avoid self-incrimination or the right to remain silent when questioned. The right may include the provision that adverse inferences cannot be made by the judge or jury regarding the refusal by a defendant to answer questions before or during a trial, hearing or any other legal proceeding. This right constitutes only a small part of the defendant&#x27;s rights as a whole.

The origin of the right to silence is attributed to Sir Edward Coke&#x27;s challenge to the ecclesiastical courts and their &quot;ex officio&quot; oath. In the late 17th century, it became established in the law of England as a reaction to the excesses of the royal inquisitions in these courts. In the United States, informing suspects of their right to remain silent and of the consequences for giving up that right forms a key part of the Miranda warning.

==History==

Neither the reasons nor the history behind the right to silence are entirely clear. The Latin brocard &quot;nemo tenetur se ipsum accusare&quot; (&#x27;no man is bound to accuse himself&#x27;) became a rallying cry for religious and political dissidents who were prosecuted in the Star Chamber and High Commission of 16th-century England. People coming before these tribunals were forced to make the &quot;ex officio&quot; oath by which they swore to truthfully answer the questions to be put before them without knowing what they were being accused of. This created what has been termed the cruel trilemma whereby these accused were forced to choose between committing the mortal sin of perjury (if they lied under oath to protect themselves), harsh punishment for contempt of court (if they refused to answer), or betraying their &quot;natural&quot; duty of self-preservation (if they told the truth to honour their oath). Sir Edward Coke&#x27;s challenge to the ecclesiastical courts and their &quot;ex officio&quot; oath is seen as the origin of the right to silence. With his decision that common law courts could issue writs of prohibition against such oaths and his arguments that such oaths were contrary to the common law (as found in his &quot;Reports&quot; and &quot;Institutes&quot;), Coke &quot;dealt the crucial blow to the oath &quot;ex officio&quot; and to the High Commission&quot;.

After the parliamentary revolutions of the late 17th century, according to some historical accounts, the right to silence became established in the law as a reaction to the excesses of the royal inquisitions in these courts. The rejection of the procedures of the Courts of Star Chamber and High Commission eventually resulted in the emergence of the principle, according to US jurist and law of evidence expert John Henry Wigmore, &quot;that no man is bound to incriminate himself, on any charge (no matter how properly instituted), or in any Court (not merely in the ecclesiastical or Star Chamber tribunals)&quot;. It was extended during the English Restoration (from 1660 on) to include &quot;an ordinary witness, and not merely the party charged&quot;.

However, the right to silence was not always a practical reality for all accused in the English courts for some period afterwards. With limited access to legal counsel (often depending on the social status of the accused), a shifting standard of proof, and a system generally distrustful of silent defendants, a criminal accused who remained silent was often believed to be guilty and was sentenced. Nevertheless, it remained a basic right available to the accused and has been an accepted practice over the past few centuries. In England, the practice of judicial questioning of accused persons at trial (as distinct from questioning prior to trial), did not really disappear until well into the 18th century, but by the 19th century, the accused were not allowed to give evidence on oath even if they wanted to – also said to be a reaction to the inequities of the Star Chamber and High Commission.

In countries formerly part of the British Empire (such as Commonwealth nations, the United States and the Republic of Ireland) the right to silence has remained enshrined in the common-law tradition inherited from England, although it no longer applies in England and Wales, where remaining silent can be considered a sign of guilt by juries. NB Scots law, which is not derived from English law but wholly separate, still upholds the full right to silence. In the US, the right existed prior to the American Revolution. However, it was considered one of the most important safeguards protecting citizens against arbitrary actions of the state, and was enshrined in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, along with the words &quot;due process&quot;, which was first mentioned in a statute of Edward III in 1354 and contains similar wording to the Fifth Amendment.

The right to silence spread to many nations of the British Empire. The two different but diverging paths along which these rights evolved and operate in Anglo-American jurisprudence (one through rights expressed in an entrenched constitution, the other in Acts of Parliament specifying rights or protections at common law) can be seen today in Commonwealth nations like New Zealand, where police officers are still required at common law to issue &quot;Miranda-style&quot; warnings (but which are completely unrelated to the US &quot;Miranda&quot; warning ruling) and inform arrested persons that they do not have to answer any questions but that whatever they do say (or do) can be used in court as evidence. The police must also determine whether the arrested persons understand these rights. Any failure to do so can jeopardize a criminal prosecution. While differing slightly from the wording used in the US, the intent is identical and comes from the inherited tradition of law. However, in Australia for instance, anything said by the accused under police questioning while in custody will generally not be accepted into evidence unless it is corroborated, generally by audio or video record. Australian police all wear chest cams as part of their standard issue, and turn them on with every interaction, so that they record and provide such evidence.

As in the US, suspects in some Commonwealth countries are also entitled to have counsel present during questioning. In the United Kingdom, laws introduced, have the suspects told they have the right to remain silent, but are now also cautioned that anything they do not reveal in questioning, but later rely upon in court may harm their defence. In other words, in some cases inferences can be drawn. The right to counsel, which also became increasingly entrenched in the US following the American Revolution, gave defendants a practical method of mounting a defense while remaining silent, and the development of the modern police force in the early 19th century opened up the question of pretrial silence for the first time. The key American case of &quot;Bram v. United States&quot; paved the way for the right to be extended to pretrial questioning, and the practice of &quot;&quot;Miranda&quot; warnings&quot; became established in the US and elsewhere following the case of &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot; in 1966.

While initially alien to inquisitorial justice systems, the right to silence spread across continental Europe, in some form, throughout the late 20th century, due to developments in international law which had an increasing universalisation of certain due process protections.

==Worldwide==

Warnings of a right to remain silent are given in approximately 108 nations around the world.

===Australia===

Australia has no constitutional protection for the right to silence, but it is broadly recognized by State and Federal Crimes Acts and Codes and is regarded by the courts as an important common law right and a part of the privilege against self-incrimination. In general, criminal suspects in Australia have the right to refuse to answer questions posed to them by police before trial and to refuse to give evidence at trial. As a general rule judges cannot direct juries to draw adverse inferences from a defendant&#x27;s silence (&quot;Petty v R&quot;) but there are exceptions to this rule, most notably in cases which rely entirely on circumstantial evidence which it is only possible for the defendant to testify about (&quot;Weissensteiner v R&quot;). This exception has been abolished in Victoria by sections 42 and 44 of the &quot;Jury Directions Act 2015&quot;. The right does not apply to corporations (&quot;EPA v Caltex&quot;).

Within Australia, the right to silence derives from common law&#x27;s Companion rule. The basic position is adverse inference may not be drawn about the defendant&#x27;s culpability, where he/she does not answer police questions. While this is the common law position, it is buttressed by various legislative provisions. Some investigations can strip the right, such as those undertaken by the Independent Commission Against Corruption.

===Bangladesh===
Article 33 of the Constitution of Bangladesh discusses the rights of the arrested and detained; no right to silence is mentioned either in the Constitution or the Bangladesh Penal Code, except in Article 35(4) of the Constitution, which protects individuals from self-implication. To facilitate protection from self-implication, Bangladesh Penal Code makes an exception in cases of confessions, in which case, the Magistrate obtaining a confession under Section 164 &quot;must&quot; explain the confessor&#x27;s right to silence, and must attest to the fact that the rights of the confessor were read out to him and explained, and the confessor waived his right of silence.

Article 33 of the Constitution of Bangladesh compels arresting authorities to inform the accused of the accusations brought against him before he is detained, and that the detained must be presented to the nearest court within 24 hours. Exceptions to this rule include preventive detention and the arrest of an enemy alien. Right to counsel is an inalienable right, but the arresting officer need not explicitly state it to the detained.

Article 35(4) of the Constitution protects individuals from self-implication. Therefore, warnings &quot;must&quot; be read out to the detained person if he wants to voluntarily confess to the charges; in this case, a Magistrate must read and explain the confessor&#x27;s right to silence and protection from self-implication, and attest to the fact that the rights of the confessor were read out to him and explained, and the confessor waived his right of silence.

===Canada===
In Canada, the right to silence is protected under the common law confessions rule, and section 7 and section 11(c) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The accused may not be compelled as a witness against himself in criminal proceedings, and therefore only voluntary statements made to police are admissible as evidence. Prior to an accused being informed of their right to legal counsel, any statements they make to police are considered involuntarily compelled and are inadmissible as evidence. After being informed of the right to counsel, the accused may choose to voluntarily answer questions and those statements would be admissible.

These rights to silence exist only when the suspect is knowingly dealing with a person in authority. When the subject is unaware he is dealing with the police, such as in the case of an undercover operation, these protections do not exist unless the authority figure actively elicits a statement. Statements made to police officers during undercover operations almost always comply with the confessions rule unless the conduct of the police was deemed so egregious that it would &quot;shock the community.&quot; However, section 7 rights might still become implicated in the case of elicitation, after which a court could only admit the statement if it is satisfied that it would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

Under the Charter, an arrested person has the right:

* To be informed promptly of the reasons therefor.
* To retain and instruct counsel without delay and be informed of that right.
* To have the validity of the detention determined by way of habeas corpus and to be released if the detention is not lawful.

The Canadian Charter warning reads (varies by police service): &quot;You are under arrest for _________ (charge); do you understand? You have the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. We will provide you with a toll-free telephone lawyer referral service, if you do not have your own lawyer. Anything you do say can and will be used in court as evidence. Do you understand? Would you like to speak to a lawyer?&quot;

A more detailed version:

I am arresting you for (charge). It is my duty to inform you that you have the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. You may call any lawyer you want. There is a 24-hour telephone service available which provides a legal aid duty lawyer who can give you legal advice in private. This advice is given without charge and the lawyer can explain the legal aid plan to you. If you wish to contact a legal aid duty lawyer, I can provide you with a telephone number. Do you understand? Do you want to call a lawyer? You are not obliged to say anything, but anything you do say may be given in evidence in court.

Section 14 of the Charter further provides that a translator must be made available so that the person can understand the proceedings against them. This right to a translator extends to the deaf. In Quebec, the Charter warning is read in Canadian French. In New Brunswick and Ottawa, the warning is read in either English or French, and the officer is required to ask the person&#x27;s language of preference before issuing the warning. In the rest of Canada, the Charter warning is read in Canadian English.

While Section 10b of the Charter guarantees the right to be provided legal counsel, Canadian law only entitles criminal suspects under the age of 18 to have counsel actually be present throughout the entire interrogation. Once an adult suspect has asserted their right to counsel, the police are obliged to hold off in attempting to obtain evidence until the suspect has had a reasonable opportunity to contact legal counsel. However, after that opportunity has been exhausted, there is no guarantee of further access until the interrogation is over. Additionally, even if the suspect directly asserts his decision to remain silent, the police may continue the interrogation. There is no automatic exclusion of evidence obtained after such an assertion, however it risks breaching the confessions rule if a court finds that it created reasonable doubt to whether the confession was obtained under &quot;oppressive conditions,&quot; a determination which is made upon the totality of evidence.

A leading case on the right to silence in Canada is &quot;R. v. Singh&quot;, where a person in police custody invoked his right to silence 18 times yet was continually questioned. In a 5–4 majority, the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that there was no ancillary right under section 7 to have the police stop questioning a suspect after the asserted their right to silence. The court did, however, acknowledge that repeated police questioning after a defendant has asserted their right to silence raises doubts regarding the admissibility of further evidence under the confessions rule, though that was not the finding in the case. Another Supreme Court case, &quot;R. v. Hodgson&quot;, clarified that the right to silence only applied to the state and could not be used to exclude confessions made to private actors.

Although an accused has the right to remain silent and may not be compelled to testify against themselves, where an accused freely chooses to take the witness box and testify, there is no further right to silence and no general restriction on what kinds of questions they may be required to answer. Section 13 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees that witnesses may not have any incriminating evidence they gave as testimony used against them in separate proceedings. In effect, a person can be compelled to give involuntary self-incriminating evidence, but only where that evidence is to be used against a third party.

In the past, most cases, except for certain sex offences or where the victims were children, spouses could not be compelled to testify against each other. However, after Bill C-32, The Victim&#x27;s Bill of Rights Act, this is no longer the case. Spouses retain the right to assert privilege, and to refuse to answer questions about communications during the marriage.

=== China ===
The right of silence is not guaranteed by law in China. Article 93 of the Criminal Procedure Law states that &quot;The criminal suspect shall answer the investigators&#x27; questions truthfully, but he shall have the right to refuse to answer any questions that are irrelevant to the case.&quot; But since the 1996 amendments to the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 15 states that &quot;It shall be strictly prohibited to extort confessions by torture, gather evidence by threat, enticement, deceit, or other illegal means, or force anyone to commit self-incrimination.&quot; In 2012 the law was also re-amended to include clauses that protect human rights. China has recognized the right against self-incrimination and forced confessions are prohibited by law. The signing of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1998, also guarantees Chinese citizens the right against self-incrimination, however the treaty has not been ratified in China.

=== Czech Republic ===
The Czech Republic protects the right to silence by two clauses in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. Article 37, clause 1 states that &quot;everyone has the right to refuse a statement if he/she would cause risk of prosecution of himself/herself or a close person&quot;. In Article 40, clause 4, it is stated that &quot;an accused person has the right to refuse a statement; he/she must not be deprived of this right in any way&quot;.

===European Union===

Within the European Union, a gradual process of harmonising the laws of all the states of the Union has resulted in the adoption a common letter of rights that will apply to everyone across the European Union. The agreed law—also known as &quot;the Reding Rights&quot; taking the name of the EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding, who has proposed and negotiated the measure to become law across the entire European Union—will mean that suspects in the European Union will once detained receive a &quot;Letter of Rights listing their basic rights during criminal proceedings&quot;.

The European law ensures that people suspected of a criminal offence receive adequate information about their basic rights during criminal proceedings. These are the right to a lawyer; to be informed of the charge; to interpretation and translation for those who do not understand the language of the proceedings; the right to remain silent and to be brought promptly before a court following arrest.

In particular, the law includes five innovations:

&lt;poem&gt;Suspects will be informed of their rights following the arrest;
They will be given a &quot;letter of rights&quot; spelling out their rights in writing;
The letter of rights will be easy to understand, without legal jargon;
It will be made available in a language the suspect understands;
It will contain practical details about the person&#x27;s rights.&lt;/poem&gt;

These rights are contained in a &quot;letter of rights&quot;—&quot;the Reding Rights&quot;—a printed document given to suspects after they are detained and before interrogation. The European Union law, proposed in July 2010 by the European Commission, was adopted by the European Parliament and Council in December 2011. The European Union Directive was published officially on 1 June 2012 in the Official Journal of the European Union L 142, 1 June 2012. It became operational across the European Union by 2 June 2014.

=== European Convention on Human Rights ===
The concept of right to silence is not specifically mentioned in the European Convention on Human Rights but the European Court of Human Rights has held that
 the right to remain silent under police questioning and the privilege against self-incrimination are generally recognized international standards which lie at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under Article 6.
===France===

In France, any person brought in police custody (&quot;garde à vue&quot;) must be informed of the maximal duration of the custody, and a number of rights, in a language that this person understands. Among these rights are: the possibility of warning a relative or employer of the custody, that of asking to be examined by a physician, and that of discussing the case with a lawyer.

The French Code of Criminal Procedure (art. L116) makes it compulsory that when an investigating judge hears a suspect, he must warn him that he has the right to remain silent, to make a statement, or to answer questions. A person against which suspicions lay cannot legally be interrogated by justice as an ordinary witness.

At the actual trial, a defendant can be compelled to make a statement. However, the code also prohibits hearing a suspect under oath; thus, a suspect may say whatever he feels fit for his defense, without fear of sanction for perjury. This prohibition is extended to the suspect&#x27;s spouse and members of his close family (this extension of the prohibition may be waived if both the prosecution and the defence counsel agree to the waiver).

Since 15 April 2011, any person held by the police has new rights:

* The person is immediately informed by a police officer, or in the presence of one, in a language that he can understand, that (Article 3):
** he has the right to ask assistance of a lawyer (63-3-1 to 63-4-3 of Penal Procedure code);
** he has the right, after answering questions about his identity, to answer other questions or to remain silent.
* From the beginning of custody, the person can ask for the assistance of a lawyer (Article 6).
* The conversation with the lawyer has to remain confidential (Article 7).
* The lawyer has the right to access some of the documents related to the procedure and to be present at any police interview of the suspect made by the police (Article 8).

Witnesses under indictment (or who are cited as suspects) cannot be heard under oath, and thus do not risk prosecution for perjury. Such witnesses must be assisted by an attorney, and must be informed of these rights when heard by the judiciary. Suspects brought before a Juge d&#x27;instruction must be informed of their right to remain silent, to make statements, or to answer questions. In all cases, an attorney can be designated by the head of the bar if necessary.

===Germany===
According to § 136 (StPO, i.e. Criminal Procedure Code) a suspect, arrested or not, has to be informed before any interrogation about their right to remain silent. Though the police and courts may not draw inference from the complete silence of the accused in any stage of criminal proceedings, inference may be drawn if the accused is selectively silent. Suspects cannot be heard under oath.

Before any interrogation begins a suspect, arrested or not, must be informed:

* Of the crime for which he is charged
* About his right to remain silent
* About his right to consult an attorney before the interview
* About his right to name any evidence in his favour

Foreign suspects have the following additional rights:

* Translation assistance, and
* Consular assistance

A person against which exist plausible causes of suspicion can be interrogated as an ordinary witness in criminal proceedings against another person. However, in this case according to § 55 StPO, the witness can refuse to answer questions which could incriminate themselves (or one of their relatives). The suspicious witness also must be cautioned about the right to remain silent. Suspicious witnesses cannot be heard under oath.

However, the German constitutional court has decided that the much more strict UK laws, in which complete silence of the accused can be used against him depending on additional evidence, are compatible with the German constitution. Thus, Germany may extradite persons to the UK. It also implies that changing the German laws towards those of the UK would not violate the German constitution.

=== Hong Kong ===
The right to silence is protected according to common law. The &quot;Rules and Directions for the Questioning of Suspects and the Taking of Statements&quot; (Rules and Directions), promulgated by the then Secretary for Security in 1992, stipulate that the caution to be used to remind a suspect of his right to remain silent when
he is questioned. The statement can be read in English, Cantonese or Mandarin:

 English: &quot;You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so but what you say may be put into writing and given in evidence.&quot;

 Cantonese: 「唔係勢必要你講嘅，除非你自己想講喇，但係你所講嘅野，可能用筆寫低及用嚟做證供嘅。」

 Mandarin: 「你不一定要說話，除非你有話要說。但是，你說的話可能會寫下來及用作證據。」
This is similar to the caution given in England and Wales prior to the passage of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.

According to Jessica Wing-kay Chiu (趙穎琦), then a PhD candidate of the University of Hong Kong, the law does not codify the exact procedure for law enforcement to serve a notice to the right to silence.

===India===
The Constitution of India guarantees every person the right against self incrimination under Article 20 (3): &quot;No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself&quot;.
It is well established that the Right against self incrimination has been granted to the accused by virtue of the pronouncement in the case of Nandini Sathpathy vs P. L. Dani, no one can forcibly extract statements from the accused, who has the right against self incrimination, not only in the court of law but also during interrogation. In 2010, the Supreme court found that forced narco-analysis, brain mapping and lie detector tests violate of Article 20(3).

===Israel===
In Israel, according to Sections 28 (Hearing arguments of the detainee) and Section 31 (Explanation of rights to the detainee) of the Criminal Procedure Law (Enforcement Authority—Arrests) 1996, an officer interrogating/arresting a suspect must duly warn him first that he does not have to say any thing that may incriminate him, and that any thing he will say may be used against him. According to Israeli law, the exercise of the right to remain silent may be considered as supplemental evidence in most cases, and this fact also needs to be explained to the suspect. Also the officer needs to inform the suspect that he has the right to notify a family member or acquaintance and a lawyer of his arrest, his right for counsel, and the duration he can be held before he is released or brought before a judge.

Israeli law has not adopted the &quot;Fruits of the Poisoned Tree&quot; doctrine, and flaws in the process of collecting it affect only the weight of tainted evidence. However, in Criminal Appeal 5121/98, &quot;Issaharov v. The Military Prosecutor&quot;, a court of nine ruled that the defendant&#x27;s confession, given without proper warning regarding the right of representation, was not considered as given with consent and free will, and was not accepted by the court.

===Japan===

According to the Constitution of Japan under Article 38(1), no person is forced to testify against themselves.

===Latvia===
In Latvia, the Criminal procedure law () (sections 60.2, 150, 265, and more) sets out a right for anyone against whom criminal proceedings has been initiated or suspicions raised to remain silent. Upon arrest and before first interrogation of a person against whom any (official or unofficial) suspicion has been raised in a criminal case, such person must be warned of his or her right to remain silent, and that everything such person says may be used against that person in a criminal proceedings. Witnesses, victims and persons whose property rights has been affected by criminal proceedings has a right not to incriminate oneself and his or her relatives and not to give any information that is directly or indirectly self-incriminating or may incriminate such persons&#x27; relatives. Refusal to testify or answer all or any questions on the basis of right against self-incrimination cannot be used against such person in any way or be used as evidence of guilt. No judge, prosecutor, investigator or any other public body may draw adverse inferences about a person from exercising a right against self-incrimination. Outside criminal proceedings right against self-incrimination is honored as long-standing unwritten general principle of law in all quasi-criminal (such as administrative offense law) and public proceedings, which has been repeatedly upheld by legal precedent and case law.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, each accused suspect has the right to remain silent to questions of the police and the prosecutor, during interrogation or investigation at the hearing. According to Dutch law, only the police officer will read the rights of the suspect in the police station. Security guards have the right to put somebody under arrest, but they have to hand over the suspect immediately to the police officer who will read the rights of the suspect later in the station. The rights are: to remain silent, the right to have an attorney, the right to have access to some files coming from the criminal dossier, and the right to make contact to an attorney.

The accused must co-operate in providing material which exists independent of the will of a suspect. For example, a suspect must co-operate in giving a blood, breath, or DNA sample. A suspect can also be compelled to provide biometric access to electronic devices.

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, the right of persons arrested to refrain from making a statement and to be informed of that right is contained in the Bill of Rights Act 1990, as further reflected in a practice note on police questioning issued in 2006, by then Chief Justice Sian Elias. The Evidence Act 2006 explicitly prohibits the inference of guilt in a criminal proceeding from a defendant exercising their right to silence. At common law the leading case is &quot;Taylor v New Zealand Poultry Board&quot; where Justice Cooke held, &quot;The starting point ... [is], unless an Act of Parliament imposes or authorises the imposition of a duty to the contrary, every citizen has in general a right to refuse to answer questions from anyone, including an official.&quot;

The obligation to caution arises when:

* a suspect is in custody;
* when police have enough evidence to believe the person has committed an offence;
* when detained, such as for the execution of a statutory or common law power of search or in the execution of drink driving investigations;
* other situations as dictated by statute or case law.

The caution to be given to adults is as follows:

The caution in Māori is as follows:

===Norway===

According to Straffeprosessloven (Criminal Procedures Code), a defendant cannot be obliged to testify(§90). Further; no promises, inaccurate information, threats or coercion can be used. The same applies to any means which reduces the defendants consciousness or his ability to self-determination. Any interrogation must not have as a goal to wear out the defendant(§92). However, if the defendant decides not to testify, the judge may advise him that it may in certain circumstances be held against him(§93).

In general, anyone is required to appear before the courts and give testimony, except dictated otherwise by the law(§108)
There are some notable exceptions:
§119: The court may not hear evidence from a priest in the Norwegian Church, or indeed any priest or similar in any registered faith, lawyers, defence attorneys, arbitrators in marriage affairs, medical doctors, psychologists, nurses, midwives or apothecaries, except with the explicit permission of the person entitled to silence, concerning anything they have learnt during the performance of their function. The above does not apply if testimony is required to prevent someone from being wrongfully convicted(§119). Catholic priests have refused to testify about information obtained in confession even in these cases, and the Supreme Court has not sanctioned this.
§121: Even if the relationship is not regulated by §119, the courts may relieve a witness of the duty to testify concerning information obtained in counseling, social work, medical care, judicial assistance &quot;or similar&quot;.
§122: A defendants spouse, relatives in directly ascending or descending order, siblings and their spouses are not required to give testimony. The same applies to separated or divorced spouses, or people living in a &quot;marriage like&quot; relationship, e.g. common-law marriages. The court may extend this right to fiancees, foster-parents/children/siblings.
§123: A witness may refuse to answer questions leading to self-incrimination either for the witness itself, or for anyone related to the witness as described by §122. 
§124: A witness may refuse to answer questions relating to business secrets. The court may oblige the witness to testify after consideration.
§125: The editor of a printed magazine/newspaper may refuse to divulge the writer of any articles in his journal, or sources for its content.

===Pakistan===
Article 13 of the 1973 Constitution of Pakistan protects a person, when accused of an offence, from self-incrimination.

===Philippines===
The 1987 Constitution of the Philippines, in section 12(1) of Article 3 (Bill of Rights), states:

This was expanded into a caution during arrest under Republic Act 7438. Previously, informing arrested persons of their rights occurred long after arrest, if it ever occurred at all.
Section 17 of the Bill of Rights further states that &quot;[n]o person shall be compelled to be a witness against himself&quot;, meaning a person has the right not to serve as a witness in cases in which they are the defendant so as to avoid self-incrimination.

Punishments for law enforcement officers who fail to read suspects their rights, under RA7438, are severe: besides a fine of 6,000 Philippine pesos, officials may be jailed for between eight and ten years.

In the 1999 case People vs Mahinay, G.R. No. 122485, the Supreme Court of the Philippines was asked to consider the case of Larry Mahinay y Amparado, a man convicted of the rape and murder of a 12-year-old girl, the neighbor of his employer. Mahinay confessed but later retracted his confession, claiming that he made it due to fear surrounding his imprisonment and not actual guilt. Mahinay claimed that the police officers attacked him and threatened to kill him if he would not confess, and they did not inform him of his right to remain silent until after he had already confessed and all that remained was to sign the confession.

There was no physical evidence to back up Mahinay&#x27;s claims, and his attorney claimed that Mahinay was read his rights before he confessed. In its decision to affirm Mahinay&#x27;s conviction, the court declared:

But the court also declared the following, which has since become a landmark decision in the rights of the accused in the Philippines, and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Mahinay doctrine&quot;:

No court or legislature has as yet determined the exact wording of the caution to be presented to arrested persons. As such, the Philippine National Police has created their own version. According to the 2010 edition of the official PNP manual, &quot;every police officer, either on board a mobile car, motorcycle or on foot patrol must always carry with him a police notebook, a pen and the Miranda Warning card. The notebook, which is approximately pocket-sized, will be used to inscribe important events that transpire during his tour of duty.&quot;

The version in use by the PNP reads:

Various regional offices of the PNP use translations in other languages spoken in the Philippines depending on the jurisdiction of the office. In 2012, the International Committee of the Red Cross donated 15,000 cards to the PNP, and commissioned the translation of the warning into two more languages, Visaya and Cebuano, shown on the front of the card along with the Filipino version above.

Due to the increasing numbers of arrests of foreign nationals during President Rodrigo Duterte&#x27;s Oplan Double Barrel, the Human Rights Affairs Office (PNP-HRAO) of the Philippine National Police in Camp Crame, Quezon City has further translated the Miranda warning into four foreign languages: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese. Distribution of the translated warnings to law enforcement officers will occur via a publicly available mobile app, according to the officer-in-charge of PNP-HRAO, Sr. Supt. Dennis Siervo.

According to the website of the Philippine National Police Regional Office 13, at Camp Rafael C Rodriguez in Butuan, failure to recite either the Miranda or anti-torture warnings above can result in &quot;dismissal of the case against the suspect and filing of administrative case for the arresting police [officer].&quot;

=== Republic of Ireland ===
In the Republic of Ireland, the Supreme Court held that the right was not only a common law right but also a constitutional right which might however be validly limited by legislation (O&#x27;Leary v AG [1995] 1 IR 254).

In this jurisdiction, a number of statutory measures have re-interpreted the right to silence, such as the Criminal Justice Act 1984, the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1998 and the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998. The general effect of some of these measures is to provide for adverse inferences to be drawn against a suspect who declines to answer questions while being questioned in Garda custody. The Criminal Justice Act 2006 also affects the right to silence, in that it permits inferences to be drawn from silence where no solicitor is present.

===Russian Federation===
Clause 1 of the article 51 of the Russian Constitution grants everyone the right to not witness against either themselves or against their spouses and close relatives. As the decision whether or not an answer to a particular question would lead to (self)incrimination is left to the discretion of the person being questioned, this clause allows to remain silent at any time.

===South Africa===
The Constitution of South Africa requires that any arrested person be informed of their right to remain silent and the consequences of not remaining silent, their right to choose and consult with a legal practitioner, and their right to have a legal practitioner assigned to the detained person by the state and at state expense if substantial injustice would otherwise result. The South African Police Service rules prescribe that arrested people be given a Form 14A &quot;Notice of Rights in Terms of the Constitution&quot; which describes these and other rights of arrested people.

According to Section 35 of the Constitution of 1996 (&quot;Arrested, detained and accused persons&quot;) states:
# Everyone who is arrested for allegedly committing an offence has the right
#* to remain silent;
#* to be informed promptly
#** of the right to remain silent; and
#** of the consequences of not remaining silent;
#* not to be compelled to make any confession or admission that could be used in evidence against that person;
and later in the section:
* Every accused person has a right to a fair trial, which includes the right
** not to be compelled to give self-incriminating evidence;
===Spain===
In Spain, according to the &quot;Ley de Enjuiciamiento Criminal&quot; (Penal procedure code) article 520.2, the suspect must be informed of the charges leading to his/her detention, as well as the reasons for being deprived of his/her freedom. Additionally, the individual must be advised of the following rights:

* Right to remain silent, to answer only questions of his/her choosing, or to express their desire to make a statement only in front of a judge.
* Right not to give evidence against him/herself, as well as not to confess his/her guilt.
* Right to legal representation by a private or state-funded attorney, which will assist him during hearings and procedures.
* Right to inform a member of his/her family or a person of his/her choosing regarding the detention as well as their location, at any moment of the proceedings. Foreigners have the right to contact their consulate in Spain.
* Right to request the services of an interpreter, at no cost, when the foreign national does not speak Spanish.
* Right to undergo a medical examination by the forensic doctor.

===Switzerland===
Article 158 of the unified Swiss code of criminal procedure, which entered into force in 2011, establishes that the results of an interrogation may not be used unless the accused has been informed that:

* he/she is the subject of a criminal investigation for some specific infractions,
* he/she has the right to remain silent and not to cooperate with police,
* he/she has the right to legal representation by a private or state-funded attorney, and
* he/she has the right to request the services of an interpreter.

The cantonal codes of procedure, which remain in force until 2011, generally contain similar provisions.

===Thailand===
Sections 83 and 84 of the Thai Code of Criminal Procedure, which have been amended by the Act Amending the Criminal Procedure Code (No. 22), BE 2547 (2004), require the police officers who conduct the arrests to inform the arrestees of their right against self-incrimination.

Paragraph two of section 83 reads:

In cases an arrest is conducted by an officer, the officer must inform the arrestee of the charge, produce to him a warrant of arrest, if any, and enlighten him that &quot;he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can and will be used as evidence in a trial, and that he also has the right to meet and confer with a counsel or person to become his counsel.&quot; If the arrestee wishes to inform his relative or intimate of his arrest and the fulfillment of his wish would not be difficult and not be disruptive to his arrest or restraint or detrimental to any person, the officer shall allow the arrestee to so fulfill to the extent reasonable according to the circumstances. In this respect, the arresting officer shall also draw up a record of arrest.

While paragraph one of section 84 prescribes:


===Turkey===
The right to remain silent in Turkey has been fundamentally protected under Article 38 of Chapter 13 of the Constitution of Turkey:
No one shall be compelled to make a statement that would incriminate himself/herself or his/her legal next of kin, or to present such incriminating evidence.

This right has also been noted in 
the Law on Criminal Procedure.

===Ukraine===
Section 4 of Article 29 of Constitution of Ukraine reads:

Everyone arrested or detained shall be informed without delay of the reasons for his or her arrest or detention, apprised of his or her rights, and from the moment of detention shall be given the opportunity to personally defend himself or herself, or to have the legal assistance of a defender.

Article 63 of Constitution of Ukraine reads:

The Criminal Process Code of Ukraine has some regulations on how the rights of suspects and accused. Section 2 of Article 21 reads:

Inquirer, investigator, prosecutor, judge, and court, before the first examination of the suspect, accused, and defendant, are required to advise them of the right to have a defense counsel and draw up an appropriate record thereon, as well as provide the suspect, accused, and defendant the possibility to defend themselves with legal remedies from the charge brought and ensure protection of their personal and property rights.

Article 43–1, Section 1 gives the following definition of &quot;suspect&quot;:

Consequently, the list of suspect&#x27;s rights follows:

The suspect has the right to: know what he/she is suspected of; give testimonies or refuse testifying and answering questions; have a defense counsel and meet him/her before the first examination; produce evidence; submit motions and propose disqualifications; request that the court or prosecutor verify legality of the apprehension; submit complaints against actions and decisions of the officer who conducts operational-detective activities, inquirer, investigator, and prosecutor, and, with appropriate grounds present, have his/her security ensured.
The fact that the suspect was advised of his/her rights is entered into the record of apprehension or decision to impose a measure of restraint.

Article 53 contains the following regulation:

Court, prosecutor, investigator and the inquirer are required to advise participants to the case of their rights and to ensure the possibility to enjoy such rights.

However, there are no clear regulations on how the rights should be announced. This is commonly made by reading them out when announcing the decision on instituting criminal proceedings or arrest and then requiring a suspect or arrestee to sign the list of these rights.

===United Kingdom===
The right to silence is different depending on which UK jurisdiction the suspect is questioned. In England and Wales it is possible for an adverse inference to be drawn from an accused person&#x27;s silence during questioning. The same is true for Northern Ireland under the &quot;Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1988&quot;, but no adverse inference may be drawn in Scotland under Scots law.

====England and Wales====

The right to silence has a long history in England and Wales, first having been codified in the Judges&#x27; Rules in 1912. A defendant in a criminal trial has a choice whether or not to give evidence in the proceedings. Further, there is no general duty to assist the police with their inquiries.

At common law, and particularly following the passing of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, adverse inferences may be drawn in certain circumstances where the accused:

* fails to mention any fact which he later relies upon and which in the circumstances at the time the accused could reasonably be expected to mention;
* fails to give evidence at trial or answer any question;
* fails to account on arrest for objects, substances or marks on his person, clothing or footwear, in his possession, or in the place where he is arrested; or
* fails to account on arrest for his presence at a place.

There may be no conviction based wholly on silence. Where inferences may be drawn from silence, the court must direct the jury as to the limits to the inferences which may properly be drawn from silence.

In respect of those questioned by the Serious Fraud Office, the right to silence has been reduced by virtue of Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987. The right has also been reduced for those accused of terrorist offences.

The UK has some of the strictest key disclosure laws of the western world. Under Section 49 and Section 53 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA), it is an offence to fail to disclose when requested the key to encrypted data (with a penalty of two years in prison, or five years with regards to child sex abuse cases). Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 has been used to convict people who have refused to disclose their password to customs.

=====History=====
Warnings regarding the right against self-incrimination may have originated in England and Wales. In 1912, the judges of the King&#x27;s Bench issued the Judges&#x27; Rules. These provided that, when a police member had admissible evidence to suspect a person of an offence and wished to question that suspect about an offence, the officer should first caution the person that he was entitled to remain silent. However, the warning about the possibility of anything the male suspect said being potentially used against him predates even that.

The pre-trial operation of the privilege against self-incrimination was further buttressed by the decision in &quot;Ibrahim v R&quot; [1914] AC 599 that an admission or confession made by the accused to the police would only be admissible in evidence if the prosecution could establish that it had been voluntary. An admission or confession is only voluntary if made in the exercise of a free choice about whether to speak or remain silent:

In &quot;R v Leckey&quot; (1943) CAR 128 the Court of Criminal Appeal said:

Therefore, a caution of the form of:

was used. Major reform to the questioning and treatment of suspected offenders occurred in 1984 when the Police and Criminal Evidence Act came into force. Under Code C the right to silence was amended by allowing adverse inferences to be drawn at a court hearing in cases where a suspect refuses to explain something, and then later produces an explanation (see right to silence in England and Wales). In other words, the jury is entitled to infer that the accused fabricated the explanation at a later date, as he refused to provide the explanation during police questioning. The jury is also free to make no such inference. The new caution is:

You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention, when questioned, something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence.

If questioning is forthcoming, &quot;when questioned&quot; may be replaced with &quot;now&quot;. In cases in which the suspect has clearly nothing to gain by failing to remain silent:

Anything you do say may, and will, be given in evidence.

or:

You do not have to say anything unless you wish to do so, but I must warn you that if you fail to mention any fact which you rely on in your defence in court, your failure to take this opportunity to mention it may be treated in court as supporting any relevant evidence against you. If you do wish to say anything, what you say may be given in evidence.

or even (in circumstances where no adverse inference can be drawn from silence):

You do not have to say anything, but anything you do say may be given in evidence.

====Northern Ireland====
The Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1988 provided for adverse inferences being drawn for failure to mention something prior to being charged to an offence. The Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Rules 2009/2087 which came into effect on 5 October 2009, and replaced the Criminal Procedure Rules 2005, Pt 24 provides for post-charge questioning. This can be applied for failure to mention facts after a suspect has been charged with an offence.

The scope of emergency legislation in Northern Ireland includes limitations on the right to silence, extended police detention powers and limitations on a suspect&#x27;s right to legal counsel at time of arrest which can all impact upon a suspect&#x27;s right to a fair trial. In &quot;John Murray v United Kingdom&quot;, the ECHR declared that the fair trial guarantee encompassed the entire legal process from the moment of arrest through to conviction. The ECHR addressed this issue in a limited context in &quot;Murray v UK&quot; (1996);
&quot;To deny access to a lawyer for the first 48 hours of police questioning, in a situation where the rights of the defense may well be irretrievably prejudiced, is – whatever the justification for such denial – incompatible with the rights of the accused under Article 6.&quot;

====Scotland====
The right to silence in Scots law has been enshrined in statute by section 34 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2016. Previously, the right to silence, as with much of Scots criminal law, was held under common law.

The common law caution given by police to inform a person of their right to silence in Scotland is:
&quot;You are not obliged to say anything but anything you do say will be noted down and may be used in evidence. Do you understand?&quot;

The only exception to this rule is that a person must state, upon being required to do so, their name, address, date of birth, place of birth (in such detail as a constable considers necessary or expedient for the purpose of establishing the person&#x27;s identity), and nationality. The requirement to give personal details also exists in Scots law under section 13 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, which provides that a person suspected to have committed, or suspected of having been witness to, an offence must provide the aforementioned details to a constable upon being required to do so. Failure to provide said details under section 13 is a criminal offence.

No adverse inference can be drawn by an accused person&#x27;s silence when they are interviewed under caution.

===United States===
The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against themself. At trial, the prosecution can neither call the defendant as a witness, nor comment on the defendant&#x27;s failure to testify. Whether to testify or not is exclusively the privilege of the defendant, although defendants were originally not allowed to testify on their own behalf at all. An 1864 appropriations act allowed defendants to do so while removing race restrictions, and the 1987 Supreme Court case &quot;Rock v. Arkansas&quot; established a constitutional &quot;right to take the witness stand.&quot;

Outside the context of lawful detention or arrest, a person has no duty to answer any questions of the police. If judicial compulsion is sought by the State, the person can still invoke his or her Fifth Amendment right against compulsory self-incrimination, and refuse to testify if answers to questions posed are potentially self-incriminating. Only if granted immunity by the state, in a formal proceeding, from having any testimony or evidence derived from the testimony used against him or her, can a person be compelled to answer over an assertion of this right. If police detain (or arrest) a person, they must advise him or her that he or she has a right to remain silent, and the right to an attorney, among other rights. (This is known as the &quot;Miranda&quot; warning.) If the detained person invokes these rights, all interrogation must cease, and ordinarily nothing said by the defendant in violation of this rule may be admitted against him or her at trial.

The form of the Miranda warning varies based on jurisdiction, but it usually follows this pattern: 
 You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to consult an attorney before speaking to the police and to have an attorney present during questioning now or in the future. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you wish. If you decide to answer questions now without an attorney present, you have the right to stop answering at any time. Knowing and understanding your rights as I have explained them to you, are you willing to answer my questions without an attorney present? 

On 17 June 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Salinas v. Texas&quot; that, prior to being arrested, an individual must specifically invoke the Fifth Amendment right to &quot;remain silent&quot;, otherwise selective silence can be used against him or her in court.

====Uniform Code of Military Justice====
Members of the United States Armed Forces are covered by the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Under the UCMJ, sworn military personnel, whether of enlisted, warrant or commissioned rank, have a right to remain silent that was established 16 years before the &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot; ruling. There are significant protections against coercive self incrimination in Article 31, UCMJ, but it does differ somewhat from the &quot;Miranda&quot; warning, and in essence provides greater protections. This is one difference between civilian and military justice in the United States, and many other nations have similar corollary rules regarding military justice vs. civilian justice.

<text>Zamboanga del Norte (Cebuano: &quot;Amihanang Zamboanga&quot;; Subanon: &quot;Utara Sembwangan&quot;; ), officially the Province of Zamboanga del Norte, is a province in the Philippines situated within the Zamboanga Peninsula region in Mindanao. Its capital and largest city is Dipolog and the province borders Zamboanga del Sur and Zamboanga Sibugay to the south, Misamis Occidental to the east, and the Sulu Sea to the west.

Zamboanga del Norte is the largest province of the Zamboanga Peninsula region by land area covering . Zamboanga del Norte is the 26th populous province in the Philippines.

==History==

===American invasion era===
Prior to its creation as a province, Zamboanga del Norte formed the northern portion of the historical province of Zamboanga.

The early history of Zamboanga del Norte is shared with that of Zamboanga City, which had been the center of the entire Mindanao area, most notably during the American era. When Zamboanga City became a chartered city on October 12, 1936, it encompassed the southern tip of the Zamboanga Peninsula and the island of Basilan, making it the largest city in the world in terms of land area.

=== Philippine independence ===
==== Foundation ====
Through &quot;Republic Act No. 711&quot; issued on June 6, 1952, Zamboanga province was divided into two independent provinces, which included Zamboanga del Sur.

====Martial law era====

The late 1960s in Mindanao saw a rise in land dispute conflicts arising from the influx of settlers from Luzon and Visayas, and from the Marcos administration’s encouragement of militia groups such as the Ilaga. News of the 1968 Jabidah massacre ignited a furor in the Moro community, and ethnic tensions encouraged with the formation of secessionist movements, starting from the largely political Muslim Independence Movement and Bangsamoro Liberation Organization, and eventually the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). Additionally, an economic crisis in late 1969, violent crackdowns on student protests in 1970, and 1971, and eventually the declaration of Martial Law all led to the radicalization of many students. Many of them left schools in Manila and joined the New People&#x27;s Army &quot;underground&quot; in various provinces away from the capital, bringing the New People&#x27;s Army rebellion to Mindanao for the first time.

The September 1972 declaration of Martial Law began a 14-year period historically remembered for its human rights abuses, often involving the warrantless detention, murder, and physical, sexual, or mental torture of political opponents, student activists, journalists, religious workers, farmers, and others who fought against the Marcos dictatorship. Zamboanga del Norte was the site of at least one major assassination during the Marcos Martial law era - the gunning down of Human Rights lawyers Jacobo Amatong and Zorro Aguilar by two soldiers of the Marcos government, who were never caught. In the underground, a prominent figure who was killed was underground acupuncturist and paramedic Leo Alto, who spent much of his time helping the Subanon communities in Zamboanga del Norte to fight for their ancestral lands. Alto and a Subanon companion were killed by the Philippine Constabulary in Polanco, Zamboanga del Norte on August 1, 1975.

Alto, and lawyers Amatong and Aguilar have since been honored by having their names inscribed on the wall of remembrance at the Philippines’ Bantayog ng mga Bayani, which honors the heroes and martyrs who fought against Ferdinand Marcos and his martial law regime.

=== Contemporary ===
==== Proposed carving out of new province ====
In 2017, House Bill No. 5040 was introduced in the House of Representatives seeking to carve out a new province from Zamboanga del Norte. The proposed Zamboanga Hermosa province was to consist of 12 municipalities and 2 legislative districts that make up the 3rd legislative district of Zamboanga del Norte: Baliguian, Godod, Gutalac, Kalawit, Labason, Leon B. Postigo, Liloy (its proposed capital), Salug, Sibuco, Siocon, Sirawai, and Tampilisan. However, the bill ultimately did not pass the 17th congress.

In 2023, a new House Bill 9311 proposed a creation of a new province, Zamboanga Occidental. The proposed province is supposed to include twelve municipalities: Leon B. Postigo, Salug, Godod, Liloy, Tampilisan, Kalawit, Labason, Gutalac, Baliguian, Siocon, Sirawai, and Sibuco.

===Religion===
The predominant religion was Islam until the Spanish regime took over the region and spread Christianity with the help of the church&#x27;s mission orders like the Jesuits, Augustinians, and Dominicans. The province&#x27;s first martyr of faith, soon to be raised as a saint, in Mindanao island was Padre Francesco Palliola, S.J. He was a Jesuit missionary from Nola, Italy, and was assigned to Zamboanga Peninsula. He was active as a missionary in Lubungan (Katipuan), Zamboanga del Norte, Iligan, Dapitan, and met his martyrdom at the barrio of Ponot, now a town of Jose Dalman. Roman Catholicism is a significant majority with about 50% adherence. The province has one diocese – the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dipolog under the Archdiocese of Ozamis, covering the entire province. There are also followers of other Christian sects.

==Economy==
About half of the province&#x27;s land area is devoted to agriculture. Corn, coconut, and rice are the major crops. The province being rich in marine and mineral sources, its fish production has accelerated through the development of fishponds. Commercial fishing has steadily increased through the years, with the yellow fin tuna as the primary species.

In 2006, a study by National Statistics Coordination Board (NSCB), found Zamboanga del Norte Province to be the Philippines&#x27; poorest province with a poverty incidence rate of 64.6%, an increase from 47% in year 2000 statistical figures.

As of 2015, the province&#x27;s poverty incidence has dropped to 51.6% (ranking 8th). Large foreign mining companies operating within the province such as Canadian company TVI Resource Development and Philex Mining Corp. cause adverse effects to the culture and traditions of the indigenous Subanon and other poor settlers.

<doc id="256095" wikidata="Q599306" url="?curid=256095" title="Ernie Eves">
<text>Ernest Larry Eves (born June 17, 1946) is a Canadian lawyer and former politician who served as the 23rd premier of Ontario from 2002 to 2003. A Progressive Conservative, he took over the premiership upon Mike Harris&#x27;s resignation as party leader, but the party was defeated in the 2003 election by the Liberals, under Dalton McGuinty.

Eves was born in Windsor, Ontario, to a working-class family. He studied law at Osgoode Hall Law School and practised law in his own firm, Green &amp; Eves. He was elected in the northern Ontario riding of Parry Sound in 1981 by a margin of six votes but retained the seat for 20 years. He served briefly as a cabinet minister in the short-lived government of Frank Miller in 1985, but he was consigned to the opposition benches when the Tories were defeated in a motion of no confidence by an alliance of the opposition Liberal and New Democrats. He remained in opposition until 1995, when the Tories returned to power under Mike Harris, who appointed Eves as his Deputy Premier and Minister of Finance. Family tragedy and marital problems led to his resignation from the legislature in 2001.

After a brief return to the private sector, Eves returned to politics when Harris resigned in 2002. He won the party leadership and regained a seat in the legislature after winning a by-election in the central Ontario riding of Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey. His tenure as premier was short, as his party was defeated 16 months later in the 2003 election, which saw the PC party lose 35 of its 59 seats. He resigned as leader in 2004 and retired from the legislature on January 31, 2005.

In 2007, Eves was appointed as Chairman of Jacob Securities Inc., a Toronto-based financial services company. He served in that position until July 2012.

==Early life and career==
Eves was born into a working-class family in Windsor, Ontario, in 1946, the son of Julie (née Hawrelechko) and Harry Lewis Eves, a factory worker. His maternal grandparents were Ukrainian. As a teenager, Eves moved with his family to the central Ontario town of Parry Sound. Eves went to Osgoode Hall Law School, was called to the bar in 1972, and practiced with the firm of &quot;Green and Eves&quot;. In 1981, he ran for provincial parliament in the riding of Parry Sound. He defeated Liberal candidate Richard Thomas by only six votes, leading to the nickname &quot;Landslide Ernie&quot;, and went on to keep the seat for twenty years.

Eves was a cabinet minister in the short-lived government of Frank Miller, serving as Provincial Secretary for Resources Development from February 8 to March 22, 1985, Minister of Skills Development from March 22 to May 17, 1985, and Minister of Community and Social Services from May 17 to June 26, 1985. As Minister of Skills Development, Eves was also the minister responsible for Native Affairs. In this capacity, he made history in 1985 by proclaiming Ontario as favouring native self-government. He left cabinet on the defeat of the Miller ministry in the legislature, and served as an opposition Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) until the Progressive Conservatives returned to power in 1995.

==Harris years==

Eves is a long time close friend of fellow northern Ontario MPP Mike Harris. In 1990, Eves backed Harris&#x27; bid for the party leadership. In 1995, after being elected on the &quot;Common Sense Revolution&quot;, a program of tax cuts and government cutbacks, Eves was appointed Harris&#x27; Minister of Finance and Deputy Premier.

In Finance, Eves supervised significant cuts to taxes and public spending, particularly in the field of social assistance. Provincial income taxes were cut by 30% and welfare rates were reduced by 22%, resulting in 500,000 people being cut from the Ontario welfare rolls. There were also cuts to education and health services. The Harris government justified these measures as necessary to eliminate the provincial deficit.

After initially adopting a policy of restraint toward health care costs, Eves&#x27; later budgets increased health spending. He eventually succeeded in balancing the budget early in the government&#x27;s second term.

As Minister of Finance, Eves also oversaw two privatization initiatives: the long-term lease of the Bruce nuclear generating station to British Energy and the 99-year lease of Highway 407 to a consortium of mainly foreign investors.

Upon his retirement, Eves claimed that the impact of his 22% reduction in welfare rates &quot;kept him up at night&quot;. There have also been reports that Eves was conflicted about the risks of adding $22 billion to the provincial debt by cutting taxes before balancing the budget. Some believe that Eves was responsible for restraining some of Harris&#x27; more radical initiatives during their time in office.

Despite the close friendship and similar backgrounds and beliefs of Harris and Eves, the two have very different public personae. While Harris tried to be the embodiment of a grass-roots politician, Eves was just the opposite. He was always meticulously well-turned-out in expensive suits, with court-filings revealing he spent $25,000 a year on clothing, $5,000 a year on jewelry and cufflinks and $700 a month on dry cleaning. Eves also sported a slicked-back hair style that reinforced his image as a &quot;slick&quot; politician.

Eves&#x27; personal life in the last few years of the Harris government was tumultuous. His son, Justin, was killed in a traffic accident in Parry Sound, and soon afterward his long-standing marriage broke down. Eves began a relationship with a fellow cabinet colleague, Isabel Bassett, and he and his wife separated. On February 8, 2001 Eves decided to resign from his post of Finance Minister to seek opportunities in the private sector. He became vice-chair of the investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston and senior partner at a prominent Toronto law firm.

In a March 2001 by-election, he was replaced as MPP for the riding of Parry Sound—Muskoka by Norm Miller, son of former Premier Frank Miller.

==Return to politics==
Eves&#x27; retirement was brief. When Mike Harris stepped down as Conservative leader, he ran in the 2002 Ontario Progressive Conservative leadership election. He immediately became the front-runner and most PC MPPs and members of the party came to support him. He staved off a determined run by his successor at Finance, Jim Flaherty, who pushed a hard-right agenda to appeal to the party&#x27;s grassroots. Flaherty&#x27;s campaign featured scathing attacks on Eves, calling him a &quot;serial waffler&quot; and a &quot;pale, pink imitation of Dalton McGuinty&quot;. He became leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario on March 23, 2002 despite not holding a seat at the time, following a second-ballot victory.

==Premier==

Eves was sworn in as Ontario&#x27;s 23rd Premier on April 15, 2002, and returned to the legislature as the member for Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey after a by-election on May 2, 2002.

Reforms were made to the power system. Cost over-runs at nuclear reactors and a very hot summer combined with problems in market regulation to drive hydro prices up significantly (particularly in northern Ontario). The government was forced to cancel the privatization and capped hydro rates below cost, billing the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.

In late 2002, cabinet minister Cam Jackson was forced to resign when the Liberals alleged he had spent more than $100,000 on meals and alcohol in expensive restaurants and in four star Toronto hotels. Jackson was later fully exonerated of allegations of wrongdoing. Eves was also caught unaware when the Liberals broke that Mike Harris had arranged a secret tax break for professional sports teams on his last day in office.

In December 2002, a coroner&#x27;s inquest into the death of Kimberly Rogers recommended numerous changes to the government&#x27;s welfare legislation, which Community and Social Services Minister, Brenda Elliott, dismissed as unnecessary tinkering with a system that &quot;was working effectively&quot;.

Concerned about returning to the legislature, Eves&#x27; advisors hatched a plan that turned out to be a public relations disaster. They convinced the Premier to have the Minister of Finance, Janet Ecker, present the government&#x27;s March 2003 budget at a televised press conference at the headquarters of auto parts maker Magna International, instead of in the legislature. Magna&#x27;s CEO, Belinda Stronach, was prominent PC supporter, who later became a Liberal cabinet minister at the federal level. The &quot;Magna Budget&quot; resulted in accusations that the government was trying to avoid the scrutiny of the legislature and was flouting centuries of parliamentary tradition in favour of a PR stunt. Furthermore, the expense of the move was condemned as a waste of money, considering that the legislative chamber was already equipped with video equipment for televised coverage.

The &quot;Magna Budget&quot; was intended to launch a provincial election campaign, but was so poorly received that the election was delayed until the autumn. Attacks came from not only the opposition parties and the media but from one of Eves&#x27; own party members, Gary Carr. As Speaker of the legislature, Carr ruled that the government&#x27;s actions were &quot;prima facie&quot; in contempt of the legislature. (Subsequently, the PC majority in the Legislature voted to overturn Carr&#x27;s ruling.) The budget also included several assumptions that led many commentators to believe the government was in fact running a deficit in the range of $2 billion.

On 10 June, the Eves cabinet selected judge Archie Campbell to chair its SARS Commission inquiry into the failures of the health system, after the virus that caused the SARS epidemic was transmitted on 23 February from China to Toronto, where it wreaked havoc, including from 7 March at Scarborough Grace Hospital.

Soon after the budget, Energy Minister Chris Stockwell ran into trouble when he allowed a company he regulated to pay for a family trip to Europe. After several weeks of front-page news on the scandal and an unfavourable ruling from the province&#x27;s Integrity Commissioner, Eves forced Stockwell to resign on 17 June.

In the summer of 2003, the power issue caused further trouble for Eves. During its time in office, the PC government had failed to make any substantial investments in new sources of power. Warm weather and the use of air conditioners pushed the Ontario hydro grid to the brink, and after the Northeast blackout of 2003, the provincial power utility was forced to buy expensive power from neighbouring producers in Quebec. During that time, Eves made daily television appearances announcing developments in the situation, and appealing to the public to conserve as much electricity as possible during the period. As a result of that exposure, Eves enjoyed a moderate uptick in the polls.

A highlight of his premiership was his meeting with Ukrainian opposition leader Victor Yushchenko in May 2003. During Yushchenko&#x27;s visit to Toronto, a banquet was organized by the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, attended by over 1,000 people. Yushchenko was welcomed by &quot;the members of the Canadian political elite in Toronto, headed by Premier of Ontario Ernie Eves&quot;, who was described as a leading Canadian of Ukrainian heritage, as well as federal cabinet minister Sheila Copps, Bishop Augustine Eugene Hornyak, Senator A. Raynell Andreychuk and City Councillor Gloria Lindsay Luby.

==2003 election==

In September 2003, Eves called an election for October 2, 2003. While exposure from the blackout had boosted the PCs into a short-lived tie with Dalton McGuinty&#x27;s Liberals in the polls, and despite the reputation of the Ontario Tories for increasing their support base in mid-campaign, Eves had trouble convincing voters that his party deserved to stay in office. The Tories had released their platform, &quot;The Road Ahead&quot;, in May. Eves had hired many of Harris&#x27; advisers for the campaign, and they drafted a platform that was closer to Flaherty&#x27;s (and Harris&#x27;) views than those of Eves. Eves was visibly uncomfortable defending policy proposals that he had opposed a year earlier. When a PC campaign staffer distributed a press release referring to McGuinty as an &quot;evil reptilian kitten-eater from another planet&quot;, many voters were turned off by the attack.

In contrast, the Liberals ran a highly focused, disciplined campaign on the simple theme of &quot;Choose Change&quot;. They had spent the last four years positioning themselves as the government in waiting. McGuinty appeared ready for the office of Premier and tapped into voter frustration over deteriorating public services and the needless conflict of the Harris/Eves governments. Eves was unable to make any headway in the leadership debate, appearing uncharacteristically restrained in the face of criticism from McGuinty, and was unable to revive support for his party in the final days of the campaign.

On October 2, 2003, the Liberals won 72 of the 103 seats in the Legislature, and Eves&#x27; Tories won just 24. He won his own seat by the largest margin of any PC candidate.

==Resignation==
Eves&#x27; time as Opposition leader was more fruitful, when he led attacks against the McGuinty government&#x27;s first budget, particularly the Ontario Health Premium —which broke the Liberals&#x27; campaign pledge not to raise taxes and the elimination of health services such as eye examinations and physical therapy. Despite being considered a lame-duck leader, Eves led in opinion polls for that period of time.

In early 2004, Eves announced his intention to resign prior to the fall 2004 legislative session. A leadership election chose John Tory as Eves&#x27; successor on September 18, 2004; Eves was officially neutral in the contest. Tory and Eves shared a number of attributes, both coming from the so-called Red Tory wing of the party.

Eves had been widely expected to resign his seat in the provincial legislature during the 2004 Christmas holidays in order to allow Tory an opportunity to enter the Ontario legislature through a by-election. Eves&#x27; resignation was not forthcoming. After staff in Tory&#x27;s office leaked Eves&#x27; impending resignation, Eves refused to resign, thereby undercutting the new leader&#x27;s credibility. Another report contends that Eves was refusing to resign before securing an appointment to the Canadian Senate or to a public board. As federal and provincial patronage appointments were in the hands of Liberals, it would have been difficult for John Tory to persuade either the provincial or federal government to make such an appointment.

On January 31, 2005, Eves resigned his seat in the provincial legislature. Although he had received several high-profile job offers from the private sector after stepping down as leader, he had reportedly turned them down. In 2007, he joined Jacob &amp; Company Securities Inc. (now Jacob Securities Inc.), a Toronto-based boutique investment bank that specializes in the renewable energy and clean technology sectors, where he served as Executive Chairman until July 2012.

==Career in cannabis==
In 2015, Eves became chairman of , a medical cannabis firm in Jamaica.

==Federal politics==
For many years, Eves was known as the most prominent supporter of the federal Progressive Conservative Party in Mike Harris&#x27;s government. He had supported Joe Clark from the first ballot at the party&#x27;s 1976 leadership convention, and continued to support the federal Tories in the 1990s despite the rise of the Reform Party as a rival right-wing force. He endorsed Hugh Segal&#x27;s bid for the leadership of the federal party in 1998.

Eves took out a membership in the Canadian Alliance in 2000 to support Tom Long&#x27;s leadership bid, but rejoined the Tories after Stockwell Day was chosen as the Canadian Alliance leader. During the 2002 Ontario PC Party leadership race, Eves and his supporters invited federal PC Party leader Joe Clark to attend as an honorary delegate. No such invitation was extended by any camp to the newly named Canadian Alliance leader Stephen Harper, who attended the provincial PC convention in late 2004 as leader of the Conservative Party of Canada.

<text>Zamboanga del Sur (Cebuano: &quot;Habagatang Zamboanga;&quot; Subanen: &quot;S&#x27;helatan Sembwangan/Sembwangan dapit Shelatan&quot;; , Jawi: سلاتن سامبواڠن; ), officially the Province of Zamboanga del Sur, is a province in the Philippines located in the Zamboanga Peninsula region in Mindanao. Its capital is the city of Pagadian.

Statistically grouped with Zamboanga del Sur is the highly urbanized City of Zamboanga, which is geographically separated and a chartered city and governed independently from the province and also its largest city.

The province borders Zamboanga del Norte to the north, Zamboanga Sibugay to the west, Misamis Occidental to the northeast, and Lanao del Norte to the east. To the south is the Moro Gulf.

==Etymology==
The name of Zamboanga is the Hispanicized spelling of the Sinama term for &quot;mooring place&quot; - &quot;samboangan&quot; (also spelled &quot;sambuangan&quot;; and in Subanen, &quot;sembwangan&quot;), from the root word &quot;samboang&quot; (&quot;mooring pole&quot;). &quot;Samboangan&quot; was the original name of Zamboanga City, from where the name of the peninsula is derived from. &quot;Samboangan&quot; is well-attested in Spanish, British, French, German, and American historical records from as far back as the 17th century.

This is commonly contested by folk etymologies which instead attribute the name of Zamboanga to the Indonesian word &quot;jambangan&quot; (claimed to mean &quot;place of flowers&quot;, but actually means &quot;pot&quot; or &quot;bowl&quot;), usually with claims that all ethnic groups in Zamboanga were &quot;Malays&quot;. However, this name has never been attested in any historical records prior to the 1960s.

==History==

=== Early history ===
The original inhabitants of the Zamboanga Peninsula were the Subanen, who settled along the riverbanks in inland areas; and the various Sama-Bajau and Yakan ethnic groups who settled in coastal areas. Tausūg settlers from northeastern Mindanao also migrated to the region in the 13th century.

The region was additionally settled by migrants (mostly from the Visayas islands) after World War II. Together with the original settlers, these pioneers helped develop Zamboanga del Sur into the abundant and culturally diverse province that it is..

=== American invasion era ===
Historically, Zamboanga was the capital of the Moro Province in western Mindanao, which comprised five districts: Cotabato, Davao, Sulu, Lanao, and Zamboanga. In 1940, these districts became individual provinces. Zamboanga City became the capital of Zamboanga province.

=== Philippine independence ===
Soon after World War II, the provincial capital was transferred to Dipolog. Molave was created as the provincial capital in 1948.

====Foundation====
On June 6, 1952, through &quot;Republic Act No. 711&quot;, Zamboanga del Sur was carved out from the former Zamboanga province that encompassed the entire peninsula in southwestern Mindanao. As the 52nd province of the Philippines, it originally consisted of 11 towns with the City of Zamboanga and the Island of Basilan, which were later expanded into 42 municipalities with the City of Pagadian as the capital.

This happened in the midst of the postwar period, a time when Mindanao was peaceful and increasingly progressive. Ethnic tensions were minimal, and there was essentially no presence of secessionists groups in Mindanao. Tensions in Mindanao mostly began to rise only as the 1970s approached, as a result of social and economic tensions which affected the whole country.

====The Marcos era====

The late 1960s in Mindanao saw a rise in land dispute conflicts arising from the influx of settlers from Luzon and Visayas, and from the Marcos administration’s encouragement of militia groups such as the Ilaga. News of the 1968 Jabidah massacre ignited a furor in the Moro community, and ethnic tensions encouraged with the formation of secessionist movements, starting from the largely political Muslim Independence Movement and Bangsamoro Liberation Organization, and eventually the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). Additionally, an economic crisis in late 1969, violent crackdowns on student protests in 1970, and 1971, and eventually the declaration of Martial Law all led to the radicalization of many students. Many of them left schools in Manila and joined New People&#x27;s Army units in their home provinces, bringing the New People&#x27;s Army rebellion to Mindanao for the first time.

The September 1972 declaration of Martial Law began a 14-year period historically remembered for its human rights abuses, often involving the warrantless detention, murder, and physical, sexual, or mental torture of political opponents, student activists, journalists, religious workers, farmers, and others who fought against the Marcos dictatorship. In Zamboanga del Sur, these were often attributed to military-endorsed Militias, which included the Ilaga and a number of armed cult groups, which were used to enhance the military&#x27;s numbers as it fought various resisntance movements.

The year 1982 was a particularly bloody year for Zamboanga del Sur under the Marcos dictatorship, as two massacres happened in the province that year. On February 12, 1982, members of the Ilaga killed 12 persons in Dumingag, Zamboanga del Sur, allegedly to avenge the death of their leader, who they believed had been killed by the NPA. And on May 25, 1982, three people were killed and eight people were injured when the administration&#x27;s airplanes dropped bombs on Barangay Dimalinao of Bayog, Zamboanga del Sur, allegedly as reprisal for the killing of 23 soldiers by supposed rebels two days earlier. Days later, two more men from the community were picked up and killed, and a few months later, the residence of Bayog&#x27;s Jesuit parish priest was strafed after he had written letters decrying the torture and harassment of the indigenous Subanon people from his parish, whom government had tagged as communist supporters.

===Contemporary===
==== Separation of Zamboanga Sibugay ====

<text>The Anglo-German Fellowship was a membership organisation that existed from 1935 to 1939, and aimed to encourage friendly relations between the United Kingdom and Germany. Previous groups in Britain with the same aims had been wound up when Adolf Hitler came to power. It was sometimes perceived as being allied to Nazism and had fascist members. However, its founding leader Lord Mount Temple stated publicly that membership did not assume support for Nazism or antisemitism, and he later resigned in protest against Nazi antisemitism. The organisation closed down soon afterwards, at the beginning of the Second World War.

==Origins==
In a 1935 speech, the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) had called for a closer understanding of Germany in order to safeguard peace in Europe, and in response Sir Thomas Moore, a Conservative Member of Parliament, suggested setting up a study group of pro-German MPs. The Anglo-German Fellowship, which had been in gestation for about a year, was established in September 1935 with Lord Mount Temple as chairman, and political secretary and historian Philip Conwell-Evans and businessman Ernest Tennant as honorary secretaries. Tennant was a friend of Joachim von Ribbentrop, German Ambassador to Britain. The group&#x27;s stated aims were to foster political, professional, commercial and sporting links with Germany, but Mount Temple stated publicly that membership of the society did not assume support for Nazism or anti-Semitism.

An application was made to the Board of Trade on 26 July 1935 for &quot;a licence directing an association about to be formed under the name of The Anglo-German Fellowship&quot;. The objectives of the proposed association were given as:

==Membership==
The organisation was aimed at the influential in society, and the membership was initially led by businessmen keen to promote commercial links. Members included Bank of England director Frank Cyril Tiarks, Admiral Sir Barry Domvile, Prince von Bismarck, Governor of the Bank of England Montagu Norman and Geoffrey Dawson editor of &quot;The Times&quot;. &quot;Corporate membership&quot; was also available for leading companies who wished to show their support for co-operation with Germany and this was taken out by such leading organisations as Price Waterhouse, Unilever, Dunlop Rubber, Thomas Cook &amp; Son, the Midland Bank and Lazard Brothers amongst others.

Several Members of Parliament, mostly from the Conservative Party, joined the group: they included Sir Peter Agnew, Lawrence Dundas, 2nd Marquess of Zetland, Ernest Bennett, Sir Robert Bird, Robert Tatton Bower, Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, Marquess of Clydesdale, Robert Vaughan Gower, Thomas &quot;Loel&quot; Guinness, Norman Hulbert, Archibald James, Alfred Knox, John Macnamara, Sir Thomas Moore, Assheton Pownall, Frank Sanderson, Duncan Sandys, Admiral Murray Sueter, Charles Taylor and Ronald Tree. 

Members of the House of Lords to hold membership included Lord Brocket, Lord Galloway, the Earl of Glasgow, Lord Mount Temple, Lord Londonderry, Lord Nuffield, Lord Redesdale, Lord Rennell, the Duke of Wellington, and Josiah, Baron Stamp.

By 1937, the group seems to have had 347 members.

==Activities==
The AGF&#x27;s sister organization in Berlin was the &quot;Deutsch-Englische Gesellschaft&quot;. Neither group had an avowed mission to Nazify Britain. Instead, the two groups would unite, to host grand dinners at which leading German figures noted for their Anglophilia or their familial links to the United Kingdom, such as Rudolf Hess, Joachim von Ribbentrop, General Werner von Blomberg, the Duke of Brunswick and the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, would be guests of honour.

However, the organisation was perceived to have pro-Nazi leanings and did have a number of fascist members. The spies Guy Burgess and Kim Philby, seeking to disguise their Communist affiliations, joined the AGF in the knowledge that it was widely perceived as allied to the far right.

=== Reaction to Nazi antisemitism ===

Lord Mount Temple resigned in November 1938 as chairman of the AGF because of the treatment of the German Jews by the Nazis. Following his resignation he told the press:

The Council of the Anglo-German Fellowship met in London and released a statement:
== Termination ==
At the time of the Munich Crisis in 1938 Ernest Tennant recorded that the feeling in the organisation was that it should be closed down. However, it approached the UK Foreign Office for advice. Tennant reported that Lord Vansittart recommended its remaining active, which it did until the outbreak of the Second World War. However, this claim was later refuted by Vansittart. He responded that he queried the claim with the intermediary between the Fellowship and the Foreign Office, Conwell Evans, who reported that he had met with Lord Halifax on the matter.

In the House of Commons on 7 September 1939, four days after the United Kingdom and France had declared war on Germany, Vyvyan Adams MP asked the Home Secretary what the Government is doing to &quot;deal with&quot; organisations such as the Fellowship. To this, Sir John Anderson reported to the house that &quot;the Anglo-German Fellowship has entirely suspended its activities&quot;.

<text>Sriharikota () is a barrier island off the Bay of Bengal coast located in the Shar Project settlement of Tirupati district in Andhra Pradesh, India. It houses the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, one of the two satellite launch centres in India (the other being Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station, Thiruvananthapuram). Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) launches satellites using multistage rockets such as the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle and the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle from Sriharikota. Sriharikota was selected by ISRO because of its proximity to the equator, it gives extra centripetal force from the rotation of Earth.

==Location==
Sriharikota is partly located in Sullurpeta mandal and partly located in Tada mandal in Tirupati District in Andhra Pradesh. The island separates Pulicat Lake from the Bay of Bengal. The nearest town and railway station is Sullurpeta which is 16 km west of Sriharikota and nearest city is Tirupati. A 16 km elevated road connects Sriharikota to the mainland.

==Climate==
The climate of Sriharikota is tropical wet and dry (&quot;Aw&quot;; bordering on &quot;As&quot;) in the Köppen–Geiger climate classification system. Sriharikota has hot summers and mild winters. Summers can reach up to 38 degrees Celsius, while winters can reach down to 20 degrees Celsius. Since Sriharikota is only 105 km north of Chennai, its climate is similar to that of Chennai.

<doc id="256105" wikidata="Q1361943" url="?curid=256105" title="Criminal conversion">
<text>Criminal conversion is a crime, limited to parts of common law systems outside England and Wales, of exerting unauthorized use or control of someone else&#x27;s property, at a minimum personal property, but in some jurisdictions also applying to types of real property, such as land (to squatting or holding over) or to patents, design rights and trademarks. It differs from theft in that it does not include the element of intending to deprive the owner of permanent possession of that property. As such, it is a lesser offense than the crime of theft. Criminal conversion specifies a type of conversion in that it involves criminal law, not civil law.

An example might be tapping someone&#x27;s secured wireless LAN or public utility line (which could also amount to theft of services). Another example might be taking a joy ride in a car, never intending to keep it from the owner. Some have redefined such conduct as a specific type of theft, or another offence such as taking without owner&#x27;s consent.

Note that the &quot;unauthorized&quot; use may begin after a period of authorized use, where, for example, a person rents a car then keeps it for an extra week without permission from the rental company. Another common example occurs when a person fails to report finding lost goods (including animals), intending only to keep them until someone asks for their return. When the intent becomes one of keeping the property, it is a theft.

==Fraudulent conversion==
The two-pronged definition of fraudulent conversion is &quot;conversion that is committed by the use of fraud, either by obtaining the property, or in withholding it&quot;.

In England and Wales, the term fraudulent conversion was superseded by the identically named offences under the Larceny Act 1901 and sections 20 and 21 of the Larceny Act 1916.

The former offence of fraudulent conversion was replaced by an offence of theft, contrary to section 1(1) of the Theft Act 1968, from which it slightly differs.
