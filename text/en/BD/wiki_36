<text>Kelendria Trene Rowland (born February 11, 1981) is an American singer, actress, and television personality. She rose to fame in the late 1990s as a member of Destiny&#x27;s Child, one of the world&#x27;s best-selling girl groups. During the group&#x27;s three-year hiatus, Rowland released her debut solo studio album, &quot;Simply Deep&quot; (2002), which debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and sold over 3 million copies worldwide. It included the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one single &quot;Dilemma&quot; (with Nelly), as well as the UK top-five hits &quot;Stole&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Nobody&quot;. Rowland also ventured into acting with starring roles in &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Seat Filler&quot; (2005).

Following the disbanding of Destiny&#x27;s Child in 2006, Rowland released her second studio album, &quot;Ms. Kelly&quot; (2007), which produced the international top-ten hits &quot;Like This&quot; (featuring Eve) and &quot;Work&quot;. In 2009, she hosted the first season of &quot;The Fashion Show,&quot; and was featured on David Guetta&#x27;s &quot;When Love Takes Over&quot;, which topped the charts in several countries. Its success influenced Rowland to explore electronic dance music on her third studio album, &quot;Here I Am&quot; (2011), which spawned the UK top-ten singles &quot;Commander&quot; (featuring David Guetta), &quot;Down for Whatever&quot; and &quot;What a Feeling&quot;, as a well as the hit electro-R&amp;B single &quot;Motivation&quot; (featuring Lil Wayne). Her fourth studio album, &quot;Talk a Good Game&quot; (2013), became her third top-ten album on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Rowland was a television judge on the eighth season of &quot;The X Factor UK&quot; (2011), as well as the third season of &quot;The X Factor USA&quot; (2013). She has continued her television career by hosting &quot;Chasing Destiny&quot; (2016) and starred as a coach on &quot;The Voice Australia&quot; (2017–2020). Rowland is credited with forming the girl groups Little Mix and June&#x27;s Diary from her stints on &quot;The X Factor UK&quot; and &quot;Chasing Destiny&quot; respectively.

Throughout her career, Rowland has sold over 40 million records as a solo artist, and a further estimated 60 million records with Destiny&#x27;s Child. Her work has earned her several awards and nominations, including five Grammy Awards, one &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Award, and two Soul Train Music Awards. Rowland has also received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame as part of Destiny&#x27;s Child, and as a solo artist, she has been honored by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers and &quot;Essence&quot; for her contributions to music. In 2014, Fuse ranked Rowland in their &quot;100 Most Award-Winning Artists&quot; list at number 20.

== Early life ==
Kelendria Trene Rowland was born on February 11, 1981, in Atlanta, Georgia. She is the daughter of Doris Rowland-Garrison (December 6, 1947 – December 2, 2014) and Christopher Lovett. She has an older brother named Orlando. When Rowland was seven, her mother left her father, who was an abusive alcoholic and suffered post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from serving in the Vietnam War, and Rowland went with her. When Rowland was seven or eight, she and her mother relocated to Houston, where at some point she moved in with fellow Destiny&#x27;s Child member Beyoncé, referring to Beyoncé&#x27;s mother Tina Knowles as &quot;Mama T&quot;.

Circa the early 1990s, Rowland joined Beyoncé, Tamar Davis and LaTavia Roberson in the girl group Girl&#x27;s Tyme. Girl&#x27;s Tyme competed on the nationally televised talent show &quot;Star Search&quot;, but lost the competition to Skeleton Crew. Beyoncé&#x27;s father Mathew Knowles reduced the sextet lineup to a quartet, including new member LeToya Luckett, and began managing the group. In 1995, they signed with Elektra Records, who dropped them months later. D&#x27;wayne Wiggins then began working with the group, and they were briefly signed to his label. The group went through several name changes, including the Dolls, Something Fresh, Cliché, and Destiny before deciding upon a final moniker. Under the name Destiny&#x27;s Child, the group was picked up by Columbia Records. They continued performing as an opening act for other established R&amp;B groups of the time, such as SWV, Dru Hill, and Immature.

== Career ==

=== 1997–2001: Destiny&#x27;s Child ===
Taken from a passage in the Biblical Book of Isaiah, the group changed their name to Destiny&#x27;s Child, after signing to Columbia Records in 1997. That same year, Destiny&#x27;s Child recorded their major label debut song &quot;Killing Time&quot;, for the soundtrack to the 1997 film &quot;Men in Black&quot;. Later that year, the group released their debut single, &quot;No, No, No&quot;, and the following year, they released their self-titled debut album. The album amassed moderate sales and won the group three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards. The group released their multi-platinum second album &quot;The Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot; in 1999. The album features some of the group&#x27;s most successful singles such as &quot;Bills, Bills, Bills&quot;, &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jumpin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Say My Name&quot;. &quot;Say My Name&quot; won Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and Best R&amp;B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. &quot;The Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot; sold more than 15 million copies worldwide.
Along with their commercial successes, the group became entangled in much-publicized turmoil involving the filing of a lawsuit by group members Luckett and Roberson for breach of contract. Michelle Williams and Farrah Franklin appeared in the video of &quot;Say My Name&quot;, and Luckett and Roberson were dismissed from the group. Franklin would eventually quit the group after five months. After settling on their final lineup, the trio released &quot;Independent Women Part I&quot;, which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. It became their best-charting single, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for eleven consecutive weeks. That same year, Luckett and Roberson withdrew their case against their now-former bandmates, while maintaining the suit against Mathew, which ended in both sides agreeing to stop public disparaging.

Later that year, while Destiny&#x27;s Child was completing their third album &quot;Survivor&quot;, Rowland appeared on the remix of Avant&#x27;s single &quot;Separated&quot;. &quot;Survivor&quot;, which channeled the turmoil the band underwent, spawned its lead single of the same name, which was a response to the experience. The song went on to win a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. The themes of &quot;Survivor&quot;, however, caused Luckett and Roberson to refile their lawsuit; the proceedings were eventually settled in June 2002. The album was released in May 2001, debuting at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold. &quot;Survivor&quot; has sold over twelve million copies worldwide, over forty percent of which were sold in the US alone. The album also spawned the number-one hit &quot;Bootylicious&quot; on which Rowland sang lead vocals. Before releasing their remix album &quot;This Is the Remix&quot; in 2002, the group announced a temporary hiatus to pursue solo projects.

=== 2002–2006: &quot;Simply Deep&quot; and &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; ===

In 2002, Rowland was featured on Nelly&#x27;s single &quot;Dilemma&quot;, which won the pair a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. The song became one of the most successful singles of the year, topping many charts worldwide, including the United States, where it became Rowland&#x27;s first number-one single as a solo artist, selling worldwide over 7.6 million copies. Caroline Sullivan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that because of the song&#x27;s success, &quot;Rowland is no longer a mere backing vocalist for Beyoncé.&quot;.

Rowland&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Simply Deep&quot;, was released on October 22, 2002, in the US. Featuring production contributions by Mark J. Feist, Big Bert, Rich Harrison, and singers Brandy and Solange Knowles providing background vocals, the album took Rowland&#x27;s solo work further into an alternative music mixture, which Rowland described as a &quot;weird fusion [of] a little bit of Sade and a little bit of rock.&quot; &quot;Simply Deep&quot; debuted at number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and at number three on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, with first-week sales of 77,000 copies sold. It was eventually certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). As of 2013, &quot;Simply Deep&quot; remains as Rowland&#x27;s best-selling album in the US, with 602,000 copies sold. Released to an even bigger success in international territories, &quot;Simply Deep&quot; topped the UK Albums Chart and became a gold-seller in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, resulting in worldwide sales total of 2.5 million copies. &quot;Simply Deep&quot; yielded the international top-ten single &quot;Stole&quot; and the UK top-five single &quot;Can&#x27;t Nobody&quot;.
Rowland transitioned into acting in 2002, playing the recurring role of Carly in the fourth season of UPN sitcom &quot;The Hughleys&quot;. She continued her acting career the following year, with guest roles in UPN sitcom &quot;Eve&quot; as Cleo, and in NBC drama series &quot;American Dreams&quot; as Martha Reeves. In August 2003, Rowland made her big-screen debut playing the supporting role of Kia Waterson alongside Robert Englund and Monica Keena in the slasher film, &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;, which grossed $114.5 million at the box office worldwide.
In July 2005, Rowland starred opposite Duane Martin and Shemar Moore in the romantic comedy &quot;The Seat Filler&quot;, which grossed $17.9 million worldwide. She played Jhnelle, a pop star who falls for an awards-show seat filler whom she mistakes for a high-profile entertainment attorney. After a three-year hiatus that involved concentration on individual solo projects, Rowland rejoined Beyoncé and Michelle Williams for Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s final studio album &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot;, released on November 15, 2004. The album hit number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spawned the top-five singles &quot;Lose My Breath&quot; and &quot;Soldier&quot;, which features T.I. and Lil Wayne. The following year, Destiny&#x27;s Child embarked on a worldwide concert tour, Destiny Fulfilled ... And Lovin&#x27; It. During the last stop of the European tour in Barcelona, Spain, on June 11, Rowland announced that they would disband following the North American leg of the tour. Destiny&#x27;s Child released their first compilation album &quot;Number 1&#x27;s&quot; on October 25 in the US, which peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. On March 28, 2006, Destiny&#x27;s Child accepted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Rowland and Beyoncé founded the Survivor Foundation, a charitable entity set up to provide transitional housing for victims and storm evacuees in the Houston, Texas area. The Survivor Foundation extended the philanthropic mission of the Knowles-Rowland Center for Youth, a multi-purpose community outreach facility in downtown Houston. Rowland and Beyoncé lent their voices to a collaboration with Kitten Sera, titled &quot;All That I&#x27;m Lookin for&quot;. The song appeared on &quot;The Katrina CD&quot; album, whose proceeds went to the Recording Artists for Hope organization. Rowland returned to television in 2006, playing Tammy Hamilton, in the sixth season of UPN sitcom &quot;Girlfriends&quot;. Rowland initially hoped her three-episode stint would expand to a larger recurring role, but as the show was moved to The CW Television Network the following year, plans for a return eventually went nowhere.

=== 2007–2009: &quot;Ms. Kelly&quot; ===

In June 2007, Kelly Rowland embarked on the Ms. Kelly Tour to promote her second solo album &quot;Ms. Kelly&quot;. The five-date tour visited Europe, North America, Africa, and Asia. &quot;Ms. Kelly&quot; was released on July 3, 2007, in the United States. Originally titled &quot;My Story&quot;, the album&#x27;s first version was actually scheduled for a June 2006 release, but Rowland, her management and Columbia Records decided to shelve the album at the last minute to re-work a version with a different vibe as the singer considered the final track listing &quot;too full of midtempos and ballads.&quot; Rowland eventually consulted additional producers to collaborate on the album, including Billy Mann, Mysto &amp; Pizzi, Sean Garrett, Scott Storch, and Polow da Don. Upon its release, &quot;Ms. Kelly&quot; debuted at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number two on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, with first-week sales of 86,000 copies. Outside the US, the album widely failed to reprise the success of &quot;Simply Deep&quot;, barely reaching the top-forty on the majority of all charts it appeared on, except for the UK, where it opened at number 37.

&quot;Ms. Kelly&quot; included the UK top-five hit &quot;Like This&quot;, featuring Eve, as well as the international top-ten hit &quot;Work&quot;. In July 2007, Rowland released her first DVD titled &quot;BET Presents Kelly Rowland&quot;, which celebrates the release &quot;Ms. Kelly&quot; and features an interview with Rowland about the album&#x27;s production, footage of her time with Destiny&#x27;s Child, live performances and music videos. Following the album&#x27;s lukewarm sales, it was re-released as an extended play (EP) titled, &quot;Ms. Kelly: Diva Deluxe&quot;, on March 25, 2008. The previously unreleased Bobby Womack cover &quot;Daylight&quot;, a collaboration with Travie McCoy, served as the EP&#x27;s lead single and was a moderate success in the UK.

In 2007, Rowland, along with stars such as Jessica Simpson and the cast of &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; autographed pink Goody Ouchless brushes that were made available for auction on eBay, with all proceeds going to Breast Cancer Awareness. Also, the singer teamed up with Kanye West, Nelly Furtado, and Snoop Dogg to design a Nike sneaker for another eBay auction. All proceeds went to AIDS Awareness. In October 2007, Rowland auditioned for the role of Louise, Carrie Bradshaw&#x27;s assistant, in the 2008 film adaptation of HBO&#x27;s comedy series &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. The part eventually went to Jennifer Hudson. Two months later, Rowland appeared as a choirmaster in the first season of the NBC talent show &quot;Clash of the Choirs&quot; among other musicians such as Michael Bolton, Patti LaBelle, Nick Lachey, and Blake Shelton. Rowland&#x27;s choir finished fifth in the competition, and &quot;Clash of the Choirs&quot; did not return for a second season.
In 2008, Rowland officially became an ambassador for MTV&#x27;s Staying Alive Foundation, which aims to reduce stigma against people living with HIV and AIDS. She visited projects in Tanzania and Kenya to promote the charity and underwent an HIV test in Africa to raise awareness of the disease. In 2009, Rowland connected with Serve.MTV.com, MTV&#x27;s platform to connect young people with local volunteerism opportunities, for a series of on-air PSAs. From battling homelessness to beautifying impoverished neighborhoods to saving whales, Rowland was joined by the likes of Cameron Diaz, will.i.am, and Sean Kingston as they discuss causes they volunteer to support and urge young people to join with their friends in making civic service a part of their lifestyle. That same year, she spearheaded a bone marrow drive, and joined fellow singers Alesha Dixon and Pixie Lott to create T-shirts for River Island in aid of the Prince&#x27;s Trust, profits from which help change young lives.

In January 2009, Rowland ended her professional relationship with Beyoncé&#x27;s father, Mathew Knowles, who had managed her career since she was a member of Destiny&#x27;s Child. Knowles stressed that no animosity was involved in the decision and acknowledged that Rowland will always be a part of the Knowles family. Then two months later, Rowland announced that she left Columbia Records, adding that she &quot;felt the need to explore new directions, new challenges, and new freedoms outside my comfort zone.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Rowland stated that the label ended her contract because &quot;Ms. Kelly&quot; was not commercially successful. She later signed with Universal Motown Records.

In April 2009, Rowland was featured on David Guetta&#x27;s single &quot;When Love Takes Over&quot;, which topped many charts in Europe, selling over 5,5 million copies worldwide, and received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Dance Recording. &quot;Billboard&quot; crowned the song as the number one dance-pop collaboration of all time. In May 2009, Rowland was cast to host the first season of Bravo&#x27;s reality competition series &quot;The Fashion Show&quot; alongside Isaac Mizrahi, but was replaced by fashion model Iman in the second season.

=== 2010–2012: &quot;Here I Am&quot; and &quot;The X Factor UK&quot; ===

In October 2010, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) honored Rowland at the second annual ASCAP Presents Women Behind the Music, an event that recognizes women in all areas of the music industry. Rowland&#x27;s first compilation album, &quot;Work: The Best of Kelly Rowland&quot;, was released on October 25, 2010, but failed to impact the charts.
In January 2011, Rowland reunited with Nelly on &quot;Gone&quot;, a sequel to their successful 2002 collaboration &quot;Dilemma&quot;. Upon its release, the song failed to reprise the success of &quot;Dilemma&quot;. In April 2011, Rowland appeared on Italian DJ Alex Gaudino&#x27;s single &quot;What a Feeling&quot;, which became another UK top-ten hit. During this time, Rowland&#x27;s boyfriend (and future husband), Tim Weatherspoon, became her manager.
Originally scheduled for release in 2010, Rowland&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Here I Am&quot; was released on July 26, 2011, in the United States. The album sold 77,000 copies in its first week and debuted atop the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. &quot;Here I Am&quot; produced the successful lead single &quot;Commander&quot;, which peaked in the top-ten of many charts in Europe, and the UK top-ten single &quot;Down for Whatever&quot;. It also included another successful single &quot;Motivation&quot;, with Lil Wayne, which topped the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for seven consecutive weeks and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). &quot;Motivation&quot; won Song of the Year at the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards and Top R&amp;B Song at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards, and received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. Rowland was the face of Diddy&#x27;s women&#x27;s fragrance Empress, the female counterpart to his men&#x27;s fragrance I Am King. She was also the worldwide ambassador for watchmakers company TW Steel. Rowland&#x27;s second compilation album, &quot;&quot;, was released on October 18, 2011, but failed to impact the charts. She also released her first fitness DVD titled &quot;Sexy Abs with Kelly Rowland&quot;. Later that year, it was confirmed that Rowland would replace Dannii Minogue as a judge for the eighth series of &quot;The X Factor UK&quot; alongside Louis Walsh, Gary Barlow (who replaced Simon Cowell), and Tulisa (who replaced Cheryl Cole). Rowland&#x27;s team of finalists in the &quot;Girls&quot; category, including Amelia Lily, finished in third place in one series. Rowland would also later be revealed as the judge who formed the girl group Little Mix. Due to a conflicting schedule, Rowland did not return for the ninth series in 2012 and was replaced by former judge of &quot;The X Factor USA&quot;, Nicole Scherzinger. During the Black Women in Music event held on February 8, 2012, &quot;Essence&quot; magazine honored Rowland and music executive Sylvia Rhone for their contributions to music. In April 2012, Rowland toured Australia alongside Ludacris, Chris Brown, Trey Songz, T-Pain, Ice Cube, Lupe Fiasco, and Big Sean for the urban festival, Supafest.

Rowland recorded &quot;Need a Reason&quot; with Future and Bei Maejor for the &quot;Think Like a Man&quot; soundtrack.

In June 2012, Rowland became the face of popular rum brand Bacardi. Rowland and German production team Project B reworked the Bacardi song, &quot;Bacardi Feeling (Summer Dreamin&#x27;)&quot;, and released an accompanying music video to help promote the brand.

On &quot;The X Factor USA&quot;, Rowland had more success and popularity as a judge than &quot;The X Factor UK&quot;. Later that month, Rowland performed as a supporting headlining act at the RiverFest 2013 in Little Rock, Arkansas. Rowland embarked on the Lights Out Tour, a co-headlining tour with The-Dream, to promote her fourth studio album &quot;Talk a Good Game&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In December 2013, Rowland announced her engagement to Tim Weatherspoon during an appearance on &quot;The Queen Latifah Show&quot;. They began dating circa 2009, after first meeting and becoming friends in the early 2000s, when they were introduced by Rowland&#x27;s Destiny&#x27;s Child bandmate Michelle Williams. They were married in Costa Rica on May 9, 2014, and have two sons together, born in 2014 and 2021. In June 2020, Rowland revealed she had reconciled with her estranged father, Christopher Lovett.

== Artistry ==
=== Musical style ===
Rowland&#x27;s voice is classified as a three-octave lyric mezzo-soprano, and her music includes various styles of musical genres such as contemporary R&amp;B, pop, hip hop, soul, rock, and dance. Her debut solo album &quot;Simply Deep&quot; (2002) followed an adult-alternative rock sound, while her second album &quot;Ms. Kelly&quot; (2007) featured an R&amp;B/Hip-Hop sound. In an interview with &quot;The Independent&quot;, Rowland admitted that with her first two albums, she struggled to find her sound. &quot;I was in a stage with the first two records where I was searching, and I was like, let me try a rock-dance approach, the label [and management] wanted me to try it, and I did it ... And then after that came a more urban approach with &quot;Ms. Kelly&quot; in 2007.&quot; Her third album &quot;Here I Am&quot; (2011) consisted of a pop and R&amp;B sound, with subtle influences of dance. Rowland stated that meeting David Guetta had influenced her to record dance music. During production of the album, Rowland stated that part of the reason for the new sound on &quot;Here I Am&quot; was wanting to do something different, saying &quot;I knew I couldn&#x27;t be afraid of this direction, and I wasn&#x27;t going to let the thoughts and opinions of others make me afraid to go in this direction&quot;.

Most of the lyrical themes in &quot;Simply Deep&quot; (2002) speak of love and life experiences, particularly in the songs &quot;Dilemma&quot;, in which Rowland expresses her endless love to her love interest, and &quot;Stole&quot;, in which she sings about an emotional &quot;tale of school shootings and suicides&quot;. In &quot;Ms. Kelly&quot; (2007), Rowland covers topics such as her &quot;deeply personal relationship issues&quot; in her songs, &quot;Still in Love with My Ex&quot;, &quot;Flashback&quot;, &quot;Love&quot;, &quot;Better Without You&quot; and &quot;Gotsta Go (Part I)&quot;. Alex Macpherson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that the songs could be about Rowland&#x27;s former relationship with American football player Roy Williams. &quot;Here I Am&quot; (2011) included common themes of womanhood, sexual intimacy, and love. Some of Rowland&#x27;s other songs such as &quot;Work&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Dat Chick&quot; and &quot;Work It Man&quot; have been musically compared to the work of former Destiny&#x27;s Child bandmate Beyoncé.

=== Influences ===
Rowland has cited Whitney Houston and Janet Jackson as her biggest musical influences. She stated that Houston &quot;was the woman that inspired me to sing.&quot; Rowland is also inspired by Sade Adu and says that &quot;she has a style that&#x27;s totally her own.&quot; Other inspirations include: Martin Luther King Jr.; Mariah Carey; Mary J. Blige; Naomi Campbell; and Oprah Winfrey, whom she describes as &quot;the female version of God.&quot; Rowland has discussed how living in Miami has influenced her style, growth, and music. From a fashion perspective, Rowland credits Halle Berry, Jennifer Lopez, Beyoncé, Oprah, and her grandmother as her style icons. Rowland cited Whitney Houston, Beyoncé, and Brandy as vocal inspirations for her second solo album &quot;Ms. Kelly&quot;, &quot;I love how different they are. I love how they take themselves to the next level&quot;. Her third solo album &quot;Here I Am&quot; was inspired by Donna Summer and Diana Ross, as well as dance producer will.i.am. Rowland&#x27;s fourth solo album &quot;Talk a Good Game&quot; was also inspired by Houston, Marvin Gaye, and Stevie Wonder.

== Public image ==
Rowland stated that there was a time in her life when she struggled with being dark-skinned. In October 2007, Rowland underwent plastic surgery to receive breast implants. She stated, &quot;I simply went from an A-cup to a B-cup&quot; and that &quot;the decision was 10 years in the making&quot;. In 2012, Rowland ranked at number 61 on &quot;Complex&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 Hottest Female Singers of All Time&quot; and was recognized as one of the best-dressed women by &quot;Glamour UK&quot;. In April 2013, Rowland ranked seventh on &quot;People&quot;″s Most Beautiful in the World list. On September 5, 2023, Rowland received the Fashion Icon of the Year Award at the 2023 Harlem&#x27;s Fashion Row Show and Style Awards in New York City.

==Other ventures==
===Film and television career===
Rowland branched out into acting with a guest stint on the sitcom &quot;The Hughleys&quot; in 2002, before appearing in other UPN shows such as &quot;Eve&quot; and &quot;Girlfriends&quot; in the years of 2003 and 2006 respectively. Having played the role of Tammy Hamilton, an ambitious 21-year-old apprentice to realtor Toni (Jill Marie Jones) in the latter sitcom, Rowland initially hoped her three-episode stint would expand to a larger recurring role, but as the show was moved to The CW network the following year plans for a return eventually went nowhere. Also, in 2003, she appeared in &quot;American Dreams&quot; as Martha Reeves of Martha &amp; The Vandellas, singing a version of the group&#x27;s single &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot;.

In 2002, Rowland was cast for her big-screen debut in the slasher film &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;, a crossover film directed by Ronny Yu. Cast as one of the female leads, she portrayed Kia Waterson, the frank best friend of lead character Lori Campbell, played by Monica Keena. Released to generally mixed reviews from critics, &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; topped the U.S. box office, gaining $36.4 million on its first weekend. Budgeted at $25 million, &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot; was released in theaters on August 15, 2003, and became a financial success, resulting in a worldwide box office total of $114.3 million.

The following year, Rowland returned to the big screen, this time for a lead role in the romantic comedy &quot;The Seat Filler&quot;, starring opposite Duane Martin and Shemar Moore. Executive produced by Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, the film hit theaters in the summer of 2005 and debuted at number eighteen at the box office top twenty. It eventually earned a total domestic gross ticket sales of $10.2 million. In the film, for which she recorded two songs, Rowland played a pop star who falls for an awards-show seat filler in which she mistakes for a high-profile entertainment attorney. Released to a limited number of festivals only, &quot;The Seat Filler&quot; went straight to DVD in 2006.

In October 2007, Rowland auditioned for the role of Louise, Carrie Bradshaw&#x27;s assistant, in the 2008 film adaptation of HBO&#x27;s comedy series &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. The part eventually went to Jennifer Hudson. In fall 2007, Rowland appeared as a choirmaster on the NBC reality show &quot;Clash of the Choirs&quot;. Rowland was among superstars like Michael Bolton, Patti LaBelle, Nick Lachey, and Blake Shelton. Rowland&#x27;s choir finished fifth in the competition. In 2009, she was cast to host Bravo&#x27;s reality competition series &quot;The Fashion Show&quot; alongside Isaac Mizrahi. The series premiered on May 7, 2009.

On May 30, 2011, Rowland was confirmed as a judge for the eighth series of the British television show &quot;The X Factor&quot; to replace Dannii Minogue. In addition to her judging stint, Rowland also had a supporting role in the motion picture &quot;Think Like a Man&quot; (2012), which also starred Keri Hilson, Chris Brown and Gabrielle Union. On April 30, 2012, it was officially announced that Rowland had departed &quot;The X Factor UK&quot;, due to a conflicting schedule. She was replaced by former judge of &quot;The X Factor USA&quot;, Nicole Scherzinger. Rowland was awarded Ultimate TV Personality at the 2011 &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; Ultimate Women of the Year Awards, and TV Personality of the Year at the 2012 Glamour Women of the Years Awards, for her role on the show. In August 2012, Rowland became a dance master alongside Jason Derülo, for the first season of the Australian dance talent show &quot;Everybody Dance Now&quot;. However, on August 21, 2012, the show was canceled due to poor ratings.

==Philanthropy==
Rowland and the Knowles family founded the Survivor Foundation, a charitable entity set up to provide transitional housing for 2005 Hurricane Katrina victims and storm evacuees in the Houston, Texas, area. The Survivor Foundation extended the philanthropic mission of the Knowles-Rowland Center for Youth, a multi-purpose community outreach facility in downtown Houston. Also, in 2005, Rowland and Knowles lent their voices to a collaboration with Kitten K. Sera, titled &quot;All That I&#x27;m Lookin for&quot;. The song appeared on &quot;The Katrina CD&quot; album, whose proceeds went to the &quot;Recording Artists for Hope&quot; organization.

In 2006, Rowland joined other artists such as Pink and Avril Lavigne in ads for so-called empowerment tags for the ALDO Fights AIDS campaign, which went on sale exclusively at ALDO stores and benefited the YouthAIDS initiative. In 2007, Rowland, along with stars such as Jessica Simpson and the cast of &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; autographed pink Goody Ouchless brushes that were made available for auction on eBay, with all proceeds going to Breast Cancer Awareness. Also, the singer teamed up with Kanye West, Nelly Furtado, and Snoop Dogg to design a Nike sneaker for another eBay auction. All proceeds went to AIDS Awareness.

In 2008, Rowland officially became an ambassador for MTV&#x27;s Staying Alive Foundation, which aims to reduce discrimination against people with HIV and AIDS. She has since visited projects in Tanzania and Kenya to promote the charity, and underwent a HIV and AIDS test in Africa to raise awareness of the deadly diseases. In March 2009, she spearheaded a bone marrow drive. As reported, Rowland also is readying a new charity called I Heart My Girlfriends, which will serve as an interactive support system for teenage girls.

In 2009, Rowland connected with Serve.MTV.com, MTV&#x27;s platform to connect young people with local volunteerism opportunities, for a series of on-air PSAs. From battling homelessness to beautifying impoverished neighborhoods to saving whales, Rowland was joined by the likes of Cameron Diaz, will.i.am, and Sean Kingston as they discuss causes they volunteer to support and urge young people to join with their friends in making civil service a part of their lifestyle. Also, in 2009, Rowland, along with fellow singers Alesha Dixon and Pixie Lott, created T-shirts for River Island in aid of The Prince&#x27;s Trust, profits from which help change young lives. In March 2010, Rowland launched her brand new charity, I Heart My Girlfriends. According to Rowland&#x27;s official website, the charity focuses on self-esteem, date violence prevention, community service, abstinence, sports, drug and alcohol and smoking avoidance, obesity, disabilities, education, and more.

<text>Oea (; ) was an ancient city in present-day Tripoli, Libya. It was founded by the Phoenicians in the 7th century BC and later became a Roman–Berber colony. As part of the Roman Africa Nova province, Oea and surrounding Tripolitania were prosperous. It reached its height in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, when the city experienced a golden age under the Severan dynasty in nearby Leptis Magna. The city was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate with the spread of Islam in the 7th century and came to be known as &quot;Tripoli&quot; during the 9th century.

==History==
===Antiquity===
The city was founded in the 7th centuryBC by the Phoenicians, who gave it the Libyco-Berber name Oyat (, ), suggesting that the city may have been built upon an existing native Berber village. The Phoenicians were probably attracted to the site by its natural harbour, flanked on the western shore by the small, easily defensible peninsula, on which they established their colony. The city then passed into the hands of the Greek rulers of Cyrenaica as Oea (, ). Cyrene was a colony on the North African shore, a bit east of Tambroli and halfway to Egypt. The Carthaginians later wrested it again from the Greeks.

By the later half of the 2nd century BC, Oea was conquered by the Romans, who included it in their province of Africa, and gave it the name of . Around the beginning of the 3rd century AD, it became known as the , meaning &quot;region of the three cities&quot; (namely Oea (modern Tripoli of Libya), Sabratha and Leptis Magna). It was probably raised to the rank of a separate province by Septimius Severus, who was a native of Leptis Magna.

In spite of centuries of Roman habitation, the only visible Roman remains, apart from scattered columns and capitals (usually integrated in later buildings), is the Arch of Marcus Aurelius from the 2nd century AD. There are also remains of a little temple called , conserved in Tripoli Museum.

The fact that Tripoli has been continuously inhabited, unlike Sabratha and Leptis Magna, has meant that the inhabitants have either quarried material from older buildings (destroying them in the process), or built on top of them, burying them beneath the streets, where they remain largely unexcavated.
Most of the Oea inhabitants continued to use the Phoenician language (mixed with autochthonous Libyan-Berber words) until the end of the 3rd century, even if Latin was the official language and the one used by the elite in the city. Indeed, in the 6th century, when the city was ruled by the Byzantines, only a few were able to speak Latin and all the others spoke Berber, while Phoenician had disappeared. The Christian religion coexisted with the pagan religion of the Berber–Phoenicians until the mid-3rd century. The historian Mommsen wrote that only in the 4th century was Christianity adopted by the citizens of Oea as a whole. The city prospered mainly because Rome stopped bandits from plundering the countryside, but also because the Roman Empire – under Trajan and Septimius Severus – curbed unrest among local tribal groups by creating the Limes Tripolitanus and setting up towns such as Gaerisa, forts such as Garbia, and centenaria farms along the southern edge of the Oea territory.

The names of three bishops of Oea are recorded in extant documents. At the Council of Carthage (255), which Cyprian called to discuss baptism administered by heretics, Natalis of Oea spoke in his own name and on behalf of the bishops of Sabratha and Leptis Magna. Marinianus, a Donatist, was at the joint meeting of Catholic and Donatist bishops in Carthage in 411, a time when Oea had no Catholic bishop. Cresconius was one of the Catholic bishops whom Huneric summoned to a meeting at Carthage in 484 and then exiled. Victor Vitensis says Cresconius was already bishop of Oea under King Genseric (428–467). He is mentioned in the &quot;Roman Martyrology&quot; under 28 November along with other victims of persecution by the Vandals.

Thomas C. Oden says that a bishop of Oea, whom he does not name, was at the Council of Ephesus of 431.
===Middle Ages===
The diocese was mentioned in an early 8th-century &quot;Notitia Episcopatuum&quot; of Alexandria and in that of Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise at the end of the 9th century, No longer a residential bishopric, Oea is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

There is evidence that the Tripolitania region was in relative economic decline during the 5th and 6th centuries, in part due to the political unrest spreading across the Mediterranean world in the wake of the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, as well as pressure from the invading Vandals. However the Byzantines, under emperor Justinian I, gave some prosperity to the city and probably created Christian churches for the local Berber population of the city and of the surroundings. Indeed, Christianity remained in the Oea/Tripolis area until the 11th century, as can be deduced from archeological research done in the nearby oasis of Gefara (where a Christian community was ruled by a &quot;iudex&quot;).

According to Al-Baladhuri, Tripoli was, unlike Western North Africa, taken by the Muslims just after Alexandria, in November 643. Retaken by the Byzantine army a few years later, Oea was finally conquered around 680. Even if partially destroyed, the city did not disappear under the sands in the next two centuries like Sabratha and Leptis Magna, but grew to be the capital of Tripolitania. In the 9th century the name &quot;Oea&quot; was replaced by the present name &quot;Tripoli&quot;.

===Modernity===
Immediately after the Italian conquest, the Italian administration carried out (mainly from 1919) conservation and restoration work in the city, and the Italian architect Florestano Di Fausto rearranged the area around the Arch of Marcus Aurelius in the 1930s.

<text>A manger or trough is a rack for fodder, or a structure or feeder used to hold food for animals. The word comes from the Old French &quot;mangier&quot; (meaning &quot;to eat&quot;), from Latin &quot;mandere&quot; (meaning &quot;to chew&quot;).

Mangers are mostly used in livestock raising and generally found at stables and farmhouses. They are also used to feed wild animals, e.g., in nature reserves. 

A similar trough providing drinking water for domestic or non-domestic animals is a watering trough and may be part of a larger watering structure called abreuvoir.

== The manger in Christianity ==
The manger is associated with nativity scenes where Mary and Joseph, forced by necessity to stay in a room for animals instead of a guest room, used a manger as a makeshift crib for the Baby Jesus. ( &quot;phatnē&quot;; Luke 2:7).

<text>Specially designed academic instruction in English (SDAIE) is a teaching approach intended for teaching various academic content (such as social studies, science or literature) using the English language to students who are still learning English. SDAIE requires the student possess intermediate fluency in English as well as mastery of their native language. The instruction is carefully prepared so the student can access the English language content supported by material in their primary language and carefully planned instruction that strives for comprehensible input. SDAIE is a method of teaching students in English in such a manner that they gain skills in both the subject material and in using English.

SDAIE is not an English-only submersion program where the student is dependent solely on English, nor is it a watered down curriculum. SDAIE is an approach that seeks to teach both content and language in a cognitively demanding environment. As such, it is an important aspect of some structured English immersion programs. Lessons thus include both content goals and language goals for the students.

Preparing good lessons in SDAIE require awareness that the student is not a native English speaker and avoidance of those aspects of English that might make it difficult for a person learning English as a second language. This includes avoiding idiomatic English, which may seem natural to a native speaker but would confuse non-native speakers.

==Features of SDAIE==
Low affective filter
* Error correction done in context through teacher modeling
* New teaching material introduced and presented by the teacher in a way that engages the student.

Modified speech
* slower speech rate
* clear enunciation
* controlled vocabulary
* use of cognates
* limited use of idiomatic speech
* words with double meaning defined

Contextual clues
* gestures and facial expressions
* meaning acted out
* color-coded materials/ graphic organizers

Multisensory experiences
* realia, props and manipulatives
* audio-visual materials
* hands on activities and demonstrations
* overhead transparencies and similar projection technologies

Comprehensible input
* graphic organizers (maps, charts, graphs)
* word banks with picture clue
* bulletin boards
* explanation of word origins (etymology)
* use of examples and analogies

Frequent Comprehension checks
* questions asked about details
* eliciting responses through various modalities (write on white boards, thumbs up/down, etc.)

Formative assessment
* confirmation checks
* clarification requests
* repetitions
* variety of question types
* interaction: teacher: student student:teacher student: student group

Summative assessment
* mastery assessed using a variety of modalities
* review of main topics and key vocabulary
* resulting product shows mastery of key concepts and synthesis of information
* written assessment appropriate for intermediate/ early advanced English language learners

Appropriate lesson design
* student fluency level is reflected
* evidence of scaffolding
* listening and speaking activities precede reading and writing activities
* reading assignments include prereading, during reading, postreading activities
* writing activities preceded by pre-writing
* vocabulary emphasis
* use of cooperative learning groups
* tapping prior knowledge/ personal application
* appropriate pacing
* modeling of activities
* specific learning strategies or study skills are taught and modeled
* evidence of text adaptation
* emphasis on higher order critical thinking skills
* provision of native language support
* extension/ debriefing activity included

Content-driven
* rigorous core curriculum (not &#x27;watered down&#x27;)
* key topics organized around main themes

<doc id="261042" wikidata="Q636923" url="?curid=261042" title="Kalle Päätalo">
<text>Kaarlo (Kalle) Alvar Päätalo (11 November 1919 – 20 November 2000) was a Finnish novelist, the most popular Finnish writer in the 20th century. His &quot;Iijoki&quot; series, comprising 26 novels, is one of the longest autobiographical works ever written.

==Early life==
Päätalo was born on 11 November 1919, and spent his childhood in the village of Taivalkoski, Oulu Province, Finland. Päätalo was the second oldest of eight children. Before Him, Toivo was born, but he died as a baby. After Päätalo, another son and five girls were born into the family. The oldest sister was Martta Aili (later Siljola, Keskisimonen and Lohilahti, 1922–1974). The next sibling was Brother Manne (born January 1, 1925), he died as a victim of a stabbing on September 2, 1947. After Manne, the family welcomed four girls: Kaarina, Edith, Terttu and Aune. 

His father, a lumberjack, suffered from mental disorders, and Päätalo had to maintain his family from the age of 14 in his father&#x27;s profession. At the same time, he dreamed about becoming a writer and read avidly, being much influenced by Jack London&#x27;s &quot;Martin Eden&quot; and Mika Waltari&#x27;s guidebook for aspiring writers. His war service in Winter War and Continuation War was cut short by being wounded. After the wars, he moved to Tampere where he studied at technical school, becoming a building contractor, and wrote short stories that were published in various magazines. He was married twice and had two daughters by the second marriage.

== Career ==
Päätalo debuted as a novelist in 1958 with a novel set at a building site in Tampere. In his second novel &quot;Our Daily Bread&quot;, the first book in the five-volume &quot;Koillismaa&quot; series, he turned to his native region. By this time, Päätalo was able to turn a freelance writer, and from 1962 until his death, he published one book each year. In 1971 he published what was to be the first volume in the 26-volume series &quot;Juuret Iijoen törmässä&quot; (&#x27;Roots in the Bank of River Ii&#x27;), probably the longest autobiographical narrative in the world (some 17,000 pages in total). The series charts Päätalo&#x27;s life from his early childhood to the publication of his first novel, at the same time offering an interesting view of Finnish history over some four decades as seen from an individual&#x27;s viewpoint.

Though Päätalo&#x27;s first books got favourable reviews, the prevailing critical attitude to his writing soon turned negative while his popularity remained steady. Some found the slowness of his narration and its seeming sticking to trifles tedious, while his innumerable fans, mostly among his own generation, were fascinated by the very abundance of detail, a meticulous reconstruction of the past. Other strengths of Päätalo&#x27;s style are his absolute sincerity to the reader - he seemed to leave nothing of his life untold, yet his writing is never merely sensational - and his skillful way with spoken Finnish, especially his native dialect. Recently, many critics have begun to see his works in a new light and they have also attracted the attention of younger readers. As a recognition for his career, Päätalo received the Pro Finlandia medal and Professor&#x27;s title in 1978 and an honorary doctorate at the University of Oulu in 1994.

Known as &quot;the king of reprints&quot; because of the phenomenal success of his books, Päätalo published 39 novels, two collections of short stories and one play in his lifetime, with more short stories having been published posthumously. Four of his books have been filmed, and all five volumes of the &quot;Koillismaa&quot; series have been translated into English by Richard Impola.

Päätalo died 20 November 2000.

<text>Enda Kenny (born 24 April 1951) is an Irish former Fine Gael politician who served as Taoiseach from 2011 to 2017, Leader of Fine Gael from 2002 to 2017, Minister for Defence from May to July 2014 and 2016 to 2017, Leader of the Opposition from 2002 to 2011, Minister for Tourism and Trade from 1994 to 1997 and Minister of State at the Department of Labour and Department of Education with responsibility for Youth Affairs from 1986 to 1987. He served as Teachta Dála (TD) for Mayo West from 1975 to 1997 and for Mayo from 1997 to 2020.

Kenny led Fine Gael to a historic victory at the 2011 general election, his party becoming the largest in the country for the first time, forming a coalition government with the Labour Party on 9 March 2011. He subsequently became the first Fine Gael member to be elected Taoiseach for a second consecutive term on 6 May 2016, after two months of negotiations, following the 2016 election, forming a Fine Gael-led minority government. He was the first Taoiseach from Fine Gael since John Bruton (1994–1997), and the first Leader of Fine Gael to win a general election since Garret FitzGerald in 1982. He became the longest-serving Fine Gael Taoiseach in April 2017.

Kenny stepped down as Leader of Fine Gael on 2 June 2017, and announced he would resign as Taoiseach once a new leader was chosen in early June. In the following leadership election, the then Minister for Social Protection, Leo Varadkar, was elected to succeed him as Leader of Fine Gael. Kenny tendered his resignation as Taoiseach on 13 June 2017, and was succeeded by Varadkar the following day. On 5 November 2017, Kenny announced that he would not contest the following general election.
==Early life==
Kenny was born in 1951 in Derrycoosh, Islandeady, near Castlebar, County Mayo, the third child of five of Mary Eithne (McGinley) and Henry Kenny. He was educated locally at St Patrick&#x27;s National School, Cornanool N.S, Leitir N.S and at St. Gerald&#x27;s College, Castlebar. He attended St Patrick&#x27;s College, Dublin, qualifying as a national teacher and was an undergraduate student at University College Galway. He worked as a primary school teacher for four years. He also played football for his local club Islandeady GAA.

==Career==
===Early years in Dáil Éireann (1975–1994)===
Kenny was exposed to politics from an early age, following his father Henry Kenny becoming a Fine Gael TD in 1954. In the early 1970s, he became directly involved in politics when he started helping his father with constituency clinics. In 1975, Henry Kenny (who was at this stage a Parliamentary Secretary in the government) died after a short battle with cancer. Fine Gael wanted one of his sons to stand as their candidate at the subsequent by-election, and so Enda Kenny was chosen. He was elected on the first count with 52% of the vote, and thus became the youngest member of the 20th Dáil, aged 24.

Kenny remained on the backbenches for almost a decade. He was appointed party spokesperson firstly on Youth Affairs and Sport, then Western Development; however, he failed to build a national profile as he concentrated more on constituency matters. Kenny was left out in the cold when Garret FitzGerald became Taoiseach for the first time in 1981, and again in 1982. He was, however, appointed as a member of the Fine Gael delegation at the New Ireland Forum in 1983. He later served on the British-Irish Parliamentary Association. In 1986, he became a Minister of State at the Department of Labour and Department of Education with responsibility for Youth Affairs. Fine Gael lost the 1987 general election, resulting in Kenny and Fine Gael being on the opposition benches for the next seven years. In spite of this, his national profile was raised as he served in a number of positions on the party&#x27;s front bench, including Education, Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht, and the Islands. He was also the Fine Gael Chief Whip for a short period.

===Minister for Tourism (1994–1997)===
In late 1994, the Fianna Fáil–Labour Party government collapsed; however, no general election was called. Instead, a Fine Gael–Labour Party–Democratic Left &quot;Rainbow Coalition&quot; came to power. Kenny, as Fine Gael chief whip, was a key member of the team, which negotiated the programme for government with the other parties prior to the formation of the new government. Under Taoiseach John Bruton, Kenny joined the cabinet and was appointed Minister for Tourism and Trade. During his tenure as minister, Ireland saw significant growth in the tourism sector and in its international trade position. As minister, he chaired the European Union Council of Trade Ministers, during Ireland&#x27;s six-month Presidency of the European Council, as well as co-chairing a round of the World Trade Organization talks in 1996. Among Kenny&#x27;s other achievements were the rejuvenation of the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parade in Dublin, and the successful negotiations to bring a stage of the 1998 Tour de France to Ireland. In 1997, the government was defeated at the general election and Kenny returned to the opposition benches.

===Opposition (1997–2002)===
====Fine Gael leadership elections====
=====2001=====

John Bruton resigned as leader of Fine Gael in 2001, following a vote of no confidence in his ability. Kenny stood in the subsequent leadership election, promising to &quot;electrify the party&quot;. In the final ballot it was Michael Noonan who emerged victorious (it is Fine Gael&#x27;s custom not to publish ballot results for leadership elections). Noonan did not give a spokesperson&#x27;s assignment to Kenny; this led him to accuse Noonan of sending a &quot;dangerous message&quot;.

=====2002=====

At the 2002 general election, Fine Gael suffered its worst electoral performance ever, losing 23 seats, a figure larger than expected, with its share of the vote down 5%. Kenny himself came close to losing his seat, and even went so far as to prepare a concession speech. In the end he won the third seat in the five-seat constituency. Noonan resigned as Fine Gael leader on the night of the result, an action which triggered another leadership election. Protest meetings were held by members of the party against the speed with which the leadership election had been called and the failure to broaden the franchise to the membership. It was suggested that it was foolish to choose a leader before conducting an electoral post-mortem.

Kenny once again contested the leadership and emerged successful on that occasion.

====Racist remarks====
In September 2002, Kenny was accused of making racist remarks after he used the word &quot;nigger&quot; in a joke relating to Patrice Lumumba, the assassinated first Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Kenny wanted the incident to be suppressed and specifically asked journalists not to cite it, though the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; newspaper reported his &quot;chortling repetition of the inflammatory word&quot;. He was subsequently condemned by race campaigners at home and abroad. Matters were made worse when it emerged that several of Lumumba&#x27;s relatives, including a son and several grandchildren, lived in Tallaght.

Kenny apologised unreservedly but insisted that there was no racist intent, and that he was merely quoting what a Moroccan barman had once said, while reminiscing about an incident he had witnessed in the company of his friend David Molony, whose sudden death had recently occurred. However, what he said was widely seen as politically indefensible, as a story that should not have been told in the company of reporters by someone hoping to become the next Taoiseach.

===Leader of the Opposition (2002–2011)===
Fine Gael out-performed expectations at the 2004 Local and European elections, which saw Fine Gael increase its representation from 4 MEPs of 15 from Ireland, to 5 from 13. This was the first time Fine Gael had ever defeated Fianna Fáil in a national election, as well as the first time Fianna Fáil had failed to finish first in a national election since its second place in the 1927 general election behind Cumann na nGaedheal, Fine Gael&#x27;s immediate predecessor.

In July 2005, five men from the north of Kenny&#x27;s Mayo constituency were jailed over their opposition to the Fianna Fáil-led government&#x27;s plans for the Corrib gas project. One of the men, Philip McGrath, worked for Kenny as an election agent for Rossport during general elections. Unlike his fellow Mayo Fine Gael TD, Michael Ring, Kenny was cautious about backing the men&#x27;s stance (Ring would later be forced to adopt the same policy). The Shell to Sea campaign that was founded to help release the men and get the government to change its mind shut down work on the project for fifteen months. When Gardaí were brought in to remove protesters with tactics that saw many hospitalised, Kenny said: &quot;The law must be obeyed.&quot;

In November 2005, Kenny called for the abolition of compulsory Irish for the Leaving Certificate examinations. This was opposed by all the major Irish language organisations. In March 2006, he was elected vice-president of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP), the largest European political group to which Fine Gael is affiliated. In his speech to the EPP, he stated that Fine Gael would be in government in Ireland within two years.

During the first half of 2006, Kenny went aggressively after a more populist line on the cost of immigration, street crime, paedophilia and homeowners&#x27; rights. A graphic description of a mugging he had experienced was given to the Dáil, in the context of a crime discussion, only for it to be revealed a day later that the incident had occurred in Kenya, not in Ireland.
Under Kenny, Fine Gael agreed to enter a pre-election pact with the Labour Party, to offer the electorate an alternative coalition government at the 2007 general election held on 24 May 2007. The so-called Mullingar Accord was agreed in September 2004, following the European and local elections that year. The Green Party also signalled via the media to be in favour of membership of such a coalition government after the election. However, it would not commit to an agreement before polling day.

Kenny&#x27;s leadership defined Fine Gael as a party of the progressive centre. Its policy initiatives concentrated on value for money, consumer rights, civil partnerships, reform of public spending, reward and enterprise and preventative health care policy. The party sought to retake its former mantle as the law-and-order and a party committed to defending the institutions of the state. At the Fine Gael Ardfheis in March 2007, Kenny outlined his platform for the forthcoming general election entitled the &quot;Contract for a Better Ireland&quot;. The main aspects of this &quot;contract&quot; included: 2,300 more hospital beds, 2,000 more Gardaí, tougher jail sentences and tougher bail for criminals, free health insurance for all children under 16 and lower income tax. Bertie Ahern was perceived by many to have comfortably beaten Kenny in the pre-election Leaders&#x27; debate. When the votes were counted it emerged that Fine Gael had made large gains, increasing its number of seats by twenty, to give a total of 51 seats in the new Dáil. However, Labour and the Greens failed to make gains, leaving Kenny&#x27;s &quot;Alliance for Change&quot; short of a majority. Despite predictions to the contrary, the Fianna Fáil vote recovered sufficiently to bring it to 78 seats, and a third term in government for Ahern.

Responding to the banking crisis in County Cork, on 15 February 2009, Kenny asked the entire board of the Central Bank of Ireland&#x27;s Financial Regulation section to resign.

==== Vice-president of the EPP ====
In March 2006, Enda Kenny was elected as the vice-president of the European People&#x27;s Party at the EPP Congress in Rome. At the time, the EPP was the largest political movement in Europe bringing together almost 70 member parties from throughout the continent.

Commenting on his election Kenny said, &quot;I am delighted that our sister parties have voted to maintain the central role Fine Gael has at the heart of a vastly enlarged European People&#x27;s Party. My election to this post will ensure that we will continue to have real influence in the decision-making corridors of the largest European political family&quot;.

His EPP relations would go on to play an invaluable role during his time in government and the Irish financial crisis. He left the role after 7 years in 2012.

====2010 leadership challenge====
An opinion poll published in &quot;The Irish Times&quot; on 10 June 2010 triggered a challenge to Kenny&#x27;s leadership of the party. The Ipsos MRBI poll indicated that the Labour Party had become the most popular political party in the country for the first time, and also showed a drop in backing for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, and for their leaders. It showed a five-point drop in Fianna Fáil support since January 2010, leaving that party at 17%, Fine Gael down four points to 28%, and Labour up eight points to 32%. Satisfaction with Kenny&#x27;s leadership dropped 7% to 24%.

Following the failure of the party&#x27;s deputy leader Richard Bruton to support him, he was dismissed by Kenny on 14 June 2010. He also tabled a motion of confidence in his leadership, to be held on 17 June 2010. On the following day it was revealed that nine members of the Fine Gael frontbench did not have confidence in Kenny to lead their party – composed of Simon Coveney, Denis Naughten, Olwyn Enright, Olivia Mitchell, Fergus O&#x27;Dowd, Michael Creed, Billy Timmins, Leo Varadkar and Brian Hayes. Denis Naughten said frontbench members did not have Kenny&#x27;s support and would like him to withdraw his motion of confidence and stand down in the interest of the party.

In December 2008, Vincent Browne criticised Kenny in &quot;The Irish Times&quot; for not having a grasp of the issues, notably of economic issues.

The motion of confidence in Kenny was passed. He announced a major reshuffle of his party&#x27;s front bench on 1 July 2010, re-appointing Bruton, Coveney, O&#x27;Dowd, and Varadkar.

===2011 general election===
At the start of the 2011 general election campaign, Kenny said Fine Gael recognised the importance of &quot;the giving of hope and confidence to people through the taxation system&quot;, when speaking to reporters outside party election headquarters in Dublin. &quot;The Fine Gael party in this election is the only party that is categorically saying that there will not be any increase in income tax over our period in government&quot;, he said. He said the country needed a strong government and not an administration that depended on the support of Independents. &quot;I think that this is a time for courageous and strong government. It is not a time for a government that might self-combust or that would be dependent on the whim of any mercenary Independents. This is a judgment call for the people.&quot;

There were several leaders&#x27; debates on television during the campaign. There were, uniquely, three debates on stations TV3, RTÉ and TG4, between Enda Kenny, Michaél Martin and Eamon Gilmore, and a five-way leaders&#x27; debate on RTÉ which also included Gerry Adams and John Gormley, along with the other participants from the three-way debates.

Kenny, however, refused to participate in the three-way leaders&#x27; debate proposed by TV3, stating his unhappiness that Vincent Browne was to chair the debate. Browne is a well-known critic of Fine Gael and Kenny. In 1982, Browne appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; where he poured scorn on Kenny, claiming he was &quot;purporting&quot; to be a TD. In October 2010, Browne was forced to make a public apology to Kenny after jokingly asking whether Fine Gael was requesting that he go into a darkroom with a gun and a bottle of whisky. This was in reference to Fine Gael&#x27;s position in the polls, where they were in second place to Labour, and a previous leadership challenge to Kenny by Richard Bruton. Kenny refused to appear on the leaders debate despite an offer by Browne to be replaced by a different moderator for the debate if Kenny would appear.

Kenny participated in a three-party leader debate on RTÉ moderated by Miriam O&#x27;Callaghan, and also in a five-way debate on RTÉ; this was a new format, involving all party leaders of the outgoing Dáil, including Kenny, moderated by Pat Kenny.

He participated in a three-way debate in the Irish language with Micheál Martin and Eamon Gilmore on TG4.

On 14 February 2011, Kenny met German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss the Irish economy. Kenny and Merkel have close political ties because Merkel&#x27;s CDU party and Fine Gael are both members of the centre-right European People&#x27;s Party (EPP), and the seating at EPP meetings is arranged by alphabetical order of the surname. The close relationship between these two leaders is illustrated further by the fact that Angela Merkel also backed Enda Kenny and Fine Gael during the 2007 election.
Opinion polls of 23 February 2011, sponsored by &quot;Paddy Power&quot;, the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, and &quot;The Irish Times&quot; suggested that Kenny would lead Fine Gael to its largest total of seats to date in the 31st Dáil, and that he would be elected Taoiseach.

In the election, Kenny led Fine Gael to a decisive victory. The party won 76 seats, the most in its 78-year history, becoming the largest party in the Dáil for the first time. Meanwhile, Fianna Fáil suffered the worst defeat of a sitting government in the history of the Irish state, its representation being reduced by 75%. Kenny himself topped the poll in his Mayo constituency and uniquely three others from Fine Gael were elected alongside Kenny. At a victory party in Dublin, Kenny declared Fine Gael had &quot;a massive endorsement&quot; to govern, and the election marked &quot;a transformative moment in Ireland&#x27;s history&quot;. Later, he told RTÉ that he fully expected to become Taoiseach after what he called &quot;a democratic revolution at the ballot box&quot;. While there was some talk that Fine Gael would govern alone as a minority government, senior Fine Gael leaders indicated as soon as the election result was beyond doubt that they would likely enter a coalition government with the Labour Party. Late on the night of 5 March 2011, at Dublin Castle, Fine Gael and Labour formally agreed to form a coalition government with Kenny as Taoiseach and Labour leader Eamon Gilmore as Tánaiste, with Labour being given four other seats in cabinet.

Kenny said that his first priority upon taking office would be to renegotiate the terms of the bailout for Ireland, calling the original deal &quot;a bad deal for Ireland and a bad deal for Europe&quot;.

== Taoiseach (2011–2017)==
=== 2011 ===

The 31st Dáil convened for the first time on 9 March 2011, the Dáil nominated Kenny for appointment as Taoiseach by a vote of 117–27. Kenny received his seal of office from President Mary McAleese. He also announced ministerial appointees to his Government on 9 March 2011. At just under 59 years and 11 months on accession, Kenny is the second-oldest person to have assumed the office for the first time, the oldest being Seán Lemass.

On 9 March 2011, Kenny appointed 15 junior Ministers. He also appointed a minister for political reform, and sent a request to the Office of Public Works as to how he could address ministerial transport. On 15 March 2011, it was announced that only the current president, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Justice and Equality were to have Garda drivers. All other Ministers would have to make use of their own transport with a mileage allowance and a commercial chauffeur as an expense. There was no announcement as to the continuing engagement of three government jets.

==== Ministerial pay cuts ====
In one of his first acts as Taoiseach, Kenny slashed his own pay by €14,000 (a reduction of 7%). The new government also decided to cut the pay of senior Ministers. The Taoiseach&#x27;s pay was cut from €214,187 to €200,000. Tánaiste Eamon Gilmore&#x27;s pay was cut from €197,486 to €184,405. Ministers&#x27; pay was reduced to €169,275 (from €181,283), while pay for Ministers of State was cut from €139,266 to €130,042. In another cost-cutting measure, Kenny asked the Gardai, the Departments of Justice and Transport, as well as the Office of Public Works, to come up with a plan to reduce the amount spent on transporting Ministers and their teams.

==== Financial and banking policy ====
On 11 March 2011, his third day in office, Kenny attended his first European Council as Taoiseach, in Brussels. During that summit, he engaged in a heated confrontation with President of France Nicolas Sarkozy (which Kenny termed &quot;a Gallic spat&quot;) over Ireland&#x27;s comparatively low 12.5% corporate tax rate, which EU leaders have frequently posited as a condition of more favourable terms for the Irish bailout. Kenny held firm on his refusal to alter the corporate tax, which he reiterated in his first Leaders&#x27; Questions the following week—also declaring his government&#x27;s intention to withhold further state funds from Dublin banks until the EU agreed to new terms that forced banks&#x27; senior bondholders to share in the losses.

However, less than three weeks later on 31 March 2011, the Central Bank of Ireland published the results of its &quot;stress tests&quot; on Ireland&#x27;s four surviving banks (Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland, EBS, and Irish Life &amp; Permanent) — indicating that the banks needed to raise an additional €24,000,000,000 to remain solvent. Despite his earlier promise, the government announced the same day that the state would supply the necessary funds to keep the banks afloat, with Kenny stating that seeking the money from bondholders would be neither &quot;reasonable or logical&quot;.

Kenny was heavily criticised for his government&#x27;s action, with the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; noting that &quot;this is the fifth time Irish people have been told over the past couple of years it would be the last payout they would have to endure&quot;.

Nevertheless, the first national opinion poll since Kenny took office, published on 10 April 2011, showed that public support for Kenny&#x27;s Fine Gael party had increased since the election from 36% to 39%, although a plurality also indicated deep dissatisfaction with his rescue of the banks.

2011 also saw the introduction of clampdowns on banker salaries, banker bonuses and an effective ban on variable pay, including for things like private health insurance and childcare. A salary cap of €500,000 was introduced to bankers in the bailed out Irish banks. This represented a cut of as high as 87.5% from top banker salaries of €4 million during 2006. An 89% &#x27;Super Tax&#x27; was introduced on banker bonuses above €20,000. These measures were only relaxed in 2023.

On 21 July 2011, Kenny announced that an agreement had been reached by Eurozone leaders to reduce Ireland&#x27;s interest rate by 2% and extend the repayment period.

==== Pension levy controversy ====
On 9 May 2011, Kenny&#x27;s government announced a new job creation program, along with a plan to finance it via a 0.6% tax levy on private pension savings. Public pension funds, however, would remain untouched. The pension levy caused an immediate and intense outcry, leaving Kenny to defend the initiative as &quot;a modest proposal&quot; and refuting charges that the government would next tax personal savings. However, the controversy surrounding the levy intensified on 12 May 2011, when Kenny admitted that the holders of Approved Retirement Funds—most of whom were among the highest income earners in Ireland—would not be included in the levy.

==== Political reforms ====
On 3 May 2011, Kenny&#x27;s government approved a set of political reforms that adhered to promises he had made in the general election. Among the approved reforms were a binding Constituency Commission scheduled for June 2011, with the specific purpose of reducing the number of TDs by up to 20; an act to establish a six-month time limit for holding by-elections to the Dáil; a €750,000 spending limit in the 2011 presidential election; legislation to ban corporate donations, to be enacted by summer 2011; establishment of a Constitutional Convention in 2011, which was to include discussion of the future of the Seanad; and a referendum on its abolition, to be held in the second half of 2012. The promise to cut up to 20 TDs caused some controversy and scepticism, due to the Constitutional requirement that there be no less than one TD for every 30,000 people, which would necessitate a minimum of 150 TDs—meaning that the current number of 166 TDs could be reduced by 16 at most.

==== Vatican reprimand and response ====

On 13 July 2011, the Cloyne Report was published, detailing the investigation into allegations of child sexual abuse by 19 priests in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cloyne. Among the report&#x27;s findings were the revelation that the vast majority of allegations made in the diocese were not reported to the Garda, as required by the Church&#x27;s 1996 guidelines; that the Bishop of the Diocese, John Magee, and others had withheld full co-operation with the Government&#x27;s investigation and had deliberately misrepresented his own response to the allegations; and that the Vatican itself had both refused to co-operate in the investigation and counselled the Diocese that the 1996 guidelines were not binding.

On 20 July 2011, for its role in the scandal, stating that the Church&#x27;s role in obstructing the investigation was a serious infringement upon the sovereignty of Ireland and that the scandal revealed &quot;the dysfunction, disconnection and elitism that dominates the culture of the Vatican to this day&quot;. He added that &quot;the historic relationship between church and state in Ireland could not be the same again&quot;.

Kenny&#x27;s attack on the Vatican was unprecedented by a high-level official in Ireland. The speech was widely regarded as extraordinary, with the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; commenting that the attack was &quot;the first time that Ireland&#x27;s Parliament has publicly castigated the Vatican instead of local church leaders during the country&#x27;s 17 years of paedophile-priest scandals&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; remarked that &quot; the political classes have...lost their fear, namely of the once almighty Roman Catholic church.&quot;

On 3 September, the Holy See issued its response to Kenny&#x27;s speech noting that &quot;the accusation that the Holy See attempted &quot;to frustrate an Inquiry in a sovereign, democratic republic as little as three years ago, not three decades ago&quot;, which Kenny made no attempt to substantiate, is unfounded. Indeed, when asked, a Government spokesperson clarified that Kenny was not referring to any specific incident&quot;. The response added that &quot;Those Reports [...] contain no evidence to suggest that the Holy See meddled in the internal affairs of the Irish State or, for that matter, was involved in the day-to-day management of Irish dioceses or religious congregations with respect to sexual abuse issues&quot;.

On the quoting of then-Cardinal Ratzinger, the response notes that the quotation was taken from the &quot;Instruction on the Ecclesial Vocation of the Theologian&quot;, otherwise known as &quot;Donum Veritatis&quot; (The Gift of the Truth), published by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith on 24 May 1990, and signed by the then prefect and secretary of the congregation. Therefore, it is not a private text of the then Cardinal Ratzinger but an official document of the congregation.

==== First national address ====

Kenny gave a on 4 December 2011, ahead of the delivery of the 2012 Irish budget. He warned that Budget 2012 &quot;will be tough&quot;, and that &quot;it has to be&quot;. He also said that it would move Ireland towards a manageable deficit of 3% of GDP by 2015. This was only the sixth time that a Taoiseach had addressed the nation, reflecting the gravity of the Irish economic condition, in what Kenny stressed were &quot;exceptional&quot; circumstances. The broadcast was the second-most watched television programme of 2011 in Ireland, attracting an audience of 1.2 million viewers.

=== 2012 ===
==== Time magazine cover ====
In October 2012, Kenny became the first Taoiseach since Seán Lemass to be featured on the cover of Time magazine. The related article, entitled &quot;The Celtic Comeback&quot;, &quot;glows&quot; about Kenny&#x27;s performance as Taoiseach and says he is &quot;underestimated&quot; by the Irish public. Catherine Mayer, who wrote the article, described Kenny as &quot;charming&quot;, &quot;shrewd&quot; and &quot;extremely likeable&quot;. Mayer said that what she was really trying to see was &quot;what was behind that likability&quot;. &quot;In small groups he is much more fluent and compelling than he would appear to be were you to judge him from his big media set pieces. When cameras train on him he seems to freeze up, which is an interesting problem for somebody in that position. But when he&#x27;s relaxed he&#x27;s interesting and has a lot to say,” she said. In the article, Kenny stated; &quot;I&#x27;ve no interest in looking for credit or thanks. Providing a prosperous future for all our people, that&#x27;s what drives me.&quot;

==== European of the Year Winner ====
On the 8th of November 2012, Kenny won the “Golden Victoria European of the Year 2012” award. The award is presented by the German Magazine Publishers Association (VDZ) and previous winners of the award include José Manuel Barroso and Donald Tusk.

In a statement the publishers said they had chosen Kenny as the winner because of his &quot;strong contribution to Europe and commitment to European ideals both as Prime Minister and throughout his many years in public life&quot;. They added that &quot;In these difficult times, Europe benefits from the open, outward looking character of the Irish State and people and from the calibre of its Prime Minister, Enda Kenny.&quot;

Enda Kenny said he felt privileged to accept the award &quot;on behalf of the Irish people at home and overseas&quot; at a ceremony in Berlin. The Taoiseach said Ireland&#x27;s commitment and contribution to Europe &quot;far exceed&quot; the country&#x27;s 40-year EU membership, and pointed out that the people of Ireland voted &quot;more often more positively on Europe than any other EU member.&quot;

==== Nobel Peace Prize ====
To complete a string of awards in late 2012, on 10 December Kenny was one of 20 EU Leaders chosen to travel to Oslo to accept the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the European Union.

The chair of the Nobel Committee, Thorbjorn Jagland, said the award was both deserved and necessary. He said the EU needs to move forward to consolidate the efforts, which delivered a continent of peace.

=== 2013 ===
====Presidency of the Council of the European Union====
For the first six months of 2013, Ireland took the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The presidency is not an individual, but rather the position is held by a national government. The presidency&#x27;s function is to chair meetings of the council, determine its agendas, set a work program and facilitate dialogue both at council meetings and with other EU institutions.

At a ceremony to mark the start of the Irish EU presidency, Taoiseach Enda Kenny vowed that the Irish EU presidency would bring &quot;new hope&quot; to people in the midst of the economic crisis. &quot;We all know too well here in Ireland the huge sacrifices the crisis has meant. The people of Europe and Ireland need to know and need to see there is progress being made. That there is a next step to recovery,&quot; he said. The Government promised to push strongly for a deal on Ireland&#x27;s €64bn bank debt during the six-month EU presidency, while making progress on other vital EU issues such as setting up a banking union and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).

The budget for the presidency was €33m less than the €110m extravaganza that took place when Ireland last hosted the presidency in 2004 under Bertie Ahern&#x27;s government, which saw meetings held in five-star hotels such as Dromoland Castle in Clare and Ashford Castle in Mayo.

Despite the reduced budget, in May 2013 talks in Brussels chaired by Kenny and then Tánaiste Eamon Gilmore saw the deadlock over the EU&#x27;s nearly €1 trillion budget, which had persisted since November the previous year, finally broken.

==== Promissory notes ====
In February 2013, a deal was reached with the European Central Bank, in relation to the promissory note used to bail out the former Anglo Irish Bank. Kenny described it as &quot;a good day for the country and its people&quot;. He told the Dáil that, as a result of the changes, there would be a €20 billion reduction in the borrowing requirement of the National Treasury Management Agency in the years ahead, but also cautioned that the agreement was not a &quot;silver bullet&quot;.

==== Magdalene laundries apology ====
On 19 February 2013, Kenny apologised in Dáil Éireann, on behalf of the State to the survivors of the Magdalene laundries. The government also told the estimated 800 to 1,000 surviving Magdalene women that a compensation scheme would be set up for them. However, by February 2014, none of the 684 applicants had received their statutory old-age pensions or health care benefits promised.

==== Rumoured links to top European jobs ====
In mid 2013 Enda Kenny began to be linked with two high-profiled and powerful jobs in the EU. In August, Kenny became the frontrunner to take over the powerful post of European Council president (who chairs the meetings of EU leaders where all the major decisions are made) while he had an outside shot for the post of European Commission president (the head of the EU cabinet) according to an analysis of the contenders conducted by the influential Brussels-based opinion-shaper; Burson-Marsteller.

Kenny was in contention as he was seen as &quot;capable but not a big name with an ego&quot;. He had &quot;a good profile for the European Council job in particular – a consensus-builder from a small member state who has had some success at EU level with his successful steering of negotiations on the EU&#x27;s long-term budget during the Irish presidency.&quot;

Rumours persisted and in June 2014 Kenny again dismissed speculation that he could be appointed the new president of the European Commission stating that &quot;I&#x27;ve a job to do here&quot;.
 David Cameron confirmed that he and Angela Merkel sounded out Kenny for the European Commission president post in 2014 in his autobiography.

Kenny was still being linked to the post of president of the European Council as late as 2017 after he announced he was stepping down as Taoiseach and leader of Fine Gael. Senior EU sources told the Sunday Independent that the president at that time, Donald Tusk, might not stay for another term in office after he failed to get the backing of his home country, Poland, for a second stint in the office.

The EU source said there was &quot;significant pressure&quot; on the Taoiseach from the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) to take the job three years ago and that &quot;If Tusk steps out of the field Kenny would be the clear favourite to take over&quot;.

==== Ireland becomes the first country to exit a Troika bailout ====
Three years after being saved from bankruptcy by a trio of international lenders with a €67.5bn loan (the so-called &quot;troika&quot;), in December 2013 Kenny&#x27;s coalition government led Ireland out of the eurozone bailout programme, becoming the first country to do so.

Ireland&#x27;s announcement that it would not seek more funds from the International Monetary Fund, European Commission and European Central Bank was seized upon by the EC president, José Manuel Barroso, as evidence that the eurozone can stage a full recovery. &quot;Ireland&#x27;s success sends an important message - that with determination and support from partner countries we can and will emerge stronger from this deep crisis,&quot; he said.

At the time, Greece, Cyprus and Portugal were still working through rescue programmes, which included external scrutiny of government budgets, while Spain had also received funds to recapitalise its banks.

Having implemented spending cuts, asset sales and reforms required under the bailout, Ireland was embraced again by the debt markets that shut out the country at the turn of the decade. It had raised enough debt independently to fund itself into 2015 and had more than €20bn (£17bn) in the bank. However, relief was tempered with warnings from Irish ministers that the policy of austerity must continue, in order to drive down the country&#x27;s mountain of debt. Irish finance minister Michael Noonan said: &quot;This isn&#x27;t the end of the road. This is a very significant milestone on the road&quot;.

The view of Ireland held by other eurozone leaders greatly improved with Ireland&#x27;s recovery and exit and Enda Kenny was praised by German Chancellor Angela Merkel for implementing cuts in public spending. The exit meant Ireland regained its economic sovereignty on 15 December 2013.

==== Second national address ====
To mark the end of the Troika bailout in December 2013, Kenny gave a second address to the nation, saying that the country was moving in the right direction and that the economy was starting to recover.

=== 2014 ===
==== Resignations of Martin Callinan and Alan Shatter ====
In March 2014, in response to reports that Garda stations were bugged, Kenny informed the Dáil that he had sent Brian Purcell, the secretary general of the Department of Justice, to Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan, the day before Callinan&#x27;s sudden departure from his role. Leader of the Opposition Micheál Martin said this meant Kenny had effectively &quot;sacked&quot; Callinan. Kenny also said that he had been personally briefed on Garda surveillance by his Attorney General Máire Whelan, as Whelan did not wish to speak of the matter over the telephone.

In May 2014, following the resignation of Minister for Justice and Equality Alan Shatter, support for Kenny and his party slumped at the local and European elections. Kenny was later to be seen doing some &quot;happy dancing&quot; at the annual Bloom Festival.

=== 2015 ===
In March 2015, Kenny was criticised for his lack of understanding towards Wexford TD Mick Wallace&#x27;s inability to speak Irish, during leader&#x27;s questions in the Dáil.

On 22 September 2015, Kenny controversially delayed leaders&#x27; questions in the Dáil so that he could open the Denis O&#x27;Brien-controlled Independent News &amp; Media&#x27;s new digital hub. Kenny had previously launched a book for James Morrissey, the long-term paid spokesperson for O&#x27;Brien.

A &quot;punching gesture&quot; made by Kenny as Mary Lou McDonald was speaking during a Dáil debate on the Budget on 13 October 2015, attracted public notice. McDonald later responded by saying, &quot;a punching gesture is unusual behaviour to say the least and I would suggest not to be repeated&quot;.

Later that month, Kenny told a gathering of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) in Madrid, that he had been instructed to have the army guarded ATMs, during the economic downturn. Opposition TDs wondered why he did not tell this to the banking inquiry and Kenny was accused of &quot;telling a tall tale&quot;. Kenny himself later contradicted his own account by saying he had not received a specific briefing on the matter. A spokesman for Kenny later claimed it had been &quot;informally discussed&quot; in Government Buildings in early 2012, but that minutes had not been kept due to the sensitivity of the details therein.

=== 2016 ===

On 3 February 2016, Kenny announced his intention to request that President Higgins dissolve the 31st Dáil. He told the Dáil before its dissolution that the 2016 general election would occur on Friday, 26 February.

At a Fine Gael rally in his home town of Castlebar, County Mayo, on 20 February 2016, Kenny informed an audience that his local constituents were All-Ireland champion &quot;whingers&quot;. He later told media in Galway, that he was referring to local Fianna Fáil members.

Fine Gael won 50 seats in the 32nd Dáil, 29 short of an overall majority. Preliminary discussions took place with Leader of the Opposition Mícheál Martin, in order to agree on an arrangement to support either Kenny, Fine Gael or under a new leader to form a new government. On 10 March 2016, Kenny resigned as Taoiseach, after failing to win enough votes to be elected for a second term. He and the cabinet continued in a caretaker capacity until a new government was formed.

As caretaker Kenny went to Washington, D.C., as usual for Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day. There he was reported as having told the Irish Embassy: &quot;Bejaysus, I wish I didn&#x27;t have to go back and face what I have to face&quot;. He also met President Barack Obama, as part of the annual visit of the Taoiseach to the White House, for the handing over of the bowl of shamrock.

On 29 April 2016, an agreement was reached with Fianna Fáil to allow a Fine Gael–led minority government, and on 6 May 2016, Kenny was elected Taoiseach again, by a margin of 59 to 49 votes (with 51 abstentions), and formed a government. He became the first member of Fine Gael to win re-election as Taoiseach in the party&#x27;s history. Kenny also took over as Minister for Defence, from Simon Coveney, who was appointed Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.

Regarding the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, Kenny went on record as saying the possibility of a &quot;Brexit&quot; would cause a &quot;serious difficulty&quot; with maintaining peace in Northern Ireland. He was described as favouring Britain remaining in the European Union, for were Britain to leave the EU, the peace settlement in Northern Ireland might collapse. This statement was denounced by Theresa Villiers, the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, as &quot;scaremongering of the worst possible kind&quot;; she stated that the Common Travel Area, the &quot;open border&quot; encompassing the United Kingdom and Ireland, would not be affected by Britain&#x27;s departure from the EU.

=== 2017 ===

On 30 January 2017, a joint press meeting was held between Enda Kenny and British Prime Minister Theresa May, in Merrion Street, Dublin, to discuss the implications of Brexit on Northern Ireland and Ireland.

After the 2016 general election, there were calls for him to step down as Leader of Fine Gael, and thus as Taoiseach. After the uncovering of the Garda smear campaign of sergeant Maurice McCabe, some backbench TDs lost confidence in Kenny. Kenny had stated he would indicate his plans for a leadership change following his return from the US for the traditional St. Patrick&#x27;s Day celebrations; however, at the St. Patrick&#x27;s Day parade in New York City, Kenny stated that he would not stand down from leadership until the issues of Brexit and the aftermath of the snap election in Northern Ireland had been resolved, saying that &quot;you can&#x27;t have a situation where you have no leadership in Northern Ireland and where we have to define from a European Union point of view where Ireland would be, what the agreed terms of reference for the [Brexit] negotiations are&quot;. He also remarked that he and Prime Minister May were in agreement that there would not be a return to direct rule from Westminster in Northern Ireland. On 20 March, Finance Minister Michael Noonan stated that Kenny should remain in office at least until June, when the next phase of EU Brexit negotiations was set to begin. The following day, Kenny announced that he would not consider standing down until May at the earliest, and that he planned to attend the European Council on 29 April 2017, to discuss strategy surrounding Brexit.

==== Viral St. Patrick&#x27;s Day White House Speech ====
Enda Kenny&#x27;s speech about the value of immigration in front of the then US president Donald Trump went viral in March 2017 and was widely praised. Kenny&#x27;s address, which he delivered at a St Patrick&#x27;s Day event on Capitol Hill, made no reference to Trump&#x27;s policies. However, it was interpreted in sections of the US and UK media as a thinly veiled criticism of Trump&#x27;s plans to ban immigration from certain Muslim countries and to build a wall along the Mexican border.

The speech garnered much attention in the United States media. Occupy Democrats showcased the video on their Facebook page with the headline &quot;Irish PM SCHOOLS Trump: &#x27;St Patrick Was An Immigrant&#x27; Right to Trump&#x27;s face!&quot;. Vox covered the story with a headline reading &quot;Watch Ireland&#x27;s prime minister bash Trump&#x27;s anti-immigration views just feet away from Trump&quot; while The New York Times reported the speech under the headline: &quot;Irish Premier Uses St Patrick&#x27;s Day Ritual to Lecture Trump on Immigration.&quot;

In his speech, Kenny said Saint Patrick was an immigrant and was, in many ways, the patron saint of immigrants along with being the patron saint of Ireland. &quot;Four decades before Lady Liberty lifted her lamp, we were the wretched refuse on the teeming shore. We believed in the shelter of America, in the compassion of America, in the opportunity of America. We came and became Americans.&quot;

A video of a section of the speech was posted on the Channel 4 Facebook page on the morning of St Patrick&#x27;s Day. The video clip went viral with over 30 million views in just two days.

==== United Ireland clause ====
During the Brexit negotiations of 2017, Enda Kenny insisted on the inclusion of a united Ireland clause. The text spelt out that in the event of a future unity referendum in Ireland, as envisaged by the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland would automatically rejoin the European Union.

The British government attempted to block the insertion of the Irish unity clause into the text of an extraordinary summit of EU leaders at the end of April, with Irish officials being subjected to what one source described as &#x27;a sustained diplomatic offensive&#x27; by Britain. Officials from the British Department for Exiting the EU tried to set up a phone call between Prime Minister Theresa May and Kenny on the issue. However, the officials were told that the phone call would not happen, and that Kenny was &#x27;sticking to his guns&#x27;. Enda Kenny requested the clause and it was unanimously adopted by the other 26 member states. Political Editor Daniel McConnell argues that the specific mention of Irish unity, known as &#x27;the Kenny text&#x27; in the Brexit talks agenda, was Kenny&#x27;s crowning achievement.

==== Connacht GAA Centre of Excellence ====
Enda Kenny was credited with making the world&#x27;s largest sports air dome, located just outside Knock, County Mayo, a financially feasible project. Though an indoor playing facility of some description was in the long-term plans when the sod was first turned at the facility in 2010, it wasn&#x27;t until 2017 when the right path became clear thanks to the surprise visit of Kenny during his time in office.

Calling in for an unannounced look around, it was the Taoiseach who first suggested installing an air dome, similar to the one used by his local tennis club in Castlebar. That was the Eureka moment. Connacht GAA secretary John Prenty and Cathal Cregg, the provincial games manager based at the centre, executed on the idea.

As the groundworks were already in place, the structure, covering 15,000m2 in size, took just five employees and only one month to erect. The completed project includes a facility 26 metres in height at its highest point, 150m in length and 100m wide. It has a 30m running track on one side of the pitch with a capacity to insert seating for 600 people on the opposite side. Light, cameras and speakers are suspended against the structure right the way around. Costing just €3.1 million, the specifications alone scream value for money. This hasn&#x27;t always been a given within GAA circles - the spiralling costs of Páirc Uí Chaoimh is just one comparable case though an array of other projects could be named as examples.

Playing opportunities are only the beginning for the air dome. With the ability to host 10,000 people in a concert setting, the dome is one of the largest indoor venues in Ireland. It could host concerts, conferences, trade exhibitions and more. But it will be first and foremost a GAA facility that can pay for itself in the short- and long-term. &quot;The opportunities are limitless,&quot; said Prenty.

==== Retirement ====
On 17 May 2017, Kenny announced his intention to step down as party leader, effective at midnight. He requested that the party conclude the election of his successor by 2 June 2017, and said that he would step down as Taoiseach shortly thereafter. In the ensuing election, Minister for Social Protection Leo Varadkar was elected Leader of Fine Gael. In a statement, Kenny offered his &quot;heartiest congratulations&quot; to Varadkar, saying &quot;this is a tremendous honour for him and I know he will devote his life to improving the lives of people across our country&quot;.

In early June 2017, Kenny made his final trip to the U.S. as Taoiseach. While in Chicago on 4 June 2017, he was in attendance at Soldier Field for Irish rock band U2&#x27;s performance as part of their Joshua Tree Tour. U2 lead singer Bono dedicated their performance of the song &quot;Trip Through Your Wires&quot; to Kenny, saying &quot;The man we call Taoiseach, which I think might mean head of the house or something like that... The chieftain of our country is here tonight! ...We&#x27;d like to honour our graceful leader.&quot;

On 13 June 2017, Kenny tendered his resignation as Taoiseach. The following day, 14 June 2017, he nominated Varadkar to formally succeed him as Taoiseach in the Dáil; the Dáil approved the nomination. Kenny then made his farewell address to the Dáil, quoting U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt: &quot;Far and away, the best prize that life has to offer is a chance to work hard at work worth doing&quot;. After receiving a standing ovation from the Dáil, Kenny departed for Áras an Uachtaráin and submitted his resignation to President Michael D. Higgins. In his last duty as Taoiseach he advised the President that the Dáil had nominated Varadkar as Taoiseach and that the President should thus invite him to form a new government and appoint him as Taoiseach in accordance with the constitution.

===Return to the backbenches (2017–2020)===
On 29 December 2017, Kenny was a wedding guest of Fine Gael Senator Jerry Buttimer in Cork. When a reporter took the opportunity to remind him of a nearby event centre of which Kenny had &quot;turned the sod&quot; nearly two years previously, but of which the construction was now halted, Kenny made it known he was there to attend a marriage.

In June 2018, Kenny was named &#x27;Irish European of the Year&#x27; for &quot;his outstanding contribution to promoting and developing Ireland&#x27;s place in Europe through some of the most challenging circumstances in our history around the time of the Brexit referendum to also chairing the European Council and developing and promoting our relationship with the European Union&quot;.

In October 2019, &quot;RTÉ Investigates&quot; reported that Kenny had voted in the Dáil on just three occasions in 2019 (two of those votes taking place on the same day), and had missed 96% of votes that took place between June 2017 and July 2019. In total, he had voted just 15 times in that period out of a possible 400 votes. The report stated that Kenny&#x27;s attendance in the Dáil had been registered on 263 days during that period, and that he had claimed the full travel and accommodation allowance of €47,000 to which he was entitled, in addition to his salary.

==== TK Whitaker Award for Outstanding Contribution to Public Life ====
In December 2017, Kenny was awarded the &#x27;TK Whitaker Award for Outstanding Contribution to Public Life&#x27; at the 43rd annual Business &amp; Finance Awards, at a ceremony in Dublin. Kenny was said to have delivered &quot;a wide-ranging and truly fascinating speech&quot; in which &quot;he spoke of many of the trials, tribulations and highlights of his career, giving the crowd both ample cause for reflection, as well as many moments of laughter.&quot;

Previous and subsequent winners of the award include Presidents of Ireland Michael D. Higgins and Mary McAleese and Irish actor Gabriel Byrne.

==Post-political activity==
===&quot;Iarnród Enda&quot; (2021)===
He presented a six part Irish language television series about old Irish railway routes on RTÉ One in 2021, called &quot;Iarnród Enda&quot;. It commenced broadcasting on Monday 5 April 2021. Kenny donated his salary from the show to the Mayo Roscommon Hospice.

=== Other activity ===
In 2019, Kenny was appointed chair of the global advisory board of Dublin private equity firm Venturewave Capital. In August 2021, Kenny joined the board of Heneghan Strategic Communications, the lobbying and public relations agency run by Nigel Heneghan. In September 2021, he joined the board of Dublin-headquartered &#x27;mechanical tree&#x27; firm Carbon Collect as a non-executive director.

==Legacy==
Kenny left a lasting impact on his Fine Gael party. He is the only person in modern Irish politics to take control of a major political party from the back benches. When he became Fine Gael party leader in 2002, Fine Gael had won just 31 seats in the previous 2002 general election, 23 seats fewer than the 1997 general election. Under his leadership, Kenny grew the party in every election he contested (general, local and European) until his last general election in 2016. This run included winning 76 seats in the 2011 general election, a gain of 45 seats from when he took over the party leadership in 2002. This significant gain resulted in Fine Gael becoming the largest party in Dáil Éireann for the first time in its 78-year history.

The 2011 general election victory also included a historic 4 out of 5 seats won by Fine Gael candidates in Kenny&#x27;s Mayo constituency (with Kenny himself topping the poll). This had never been achieved by any political party in a 5-seat constituency before. According to political pundit Kevin Doyle, &quot;everyone in the party recognises that he leaves it in a toe-to-toe battle with Fianna Fáil ahead. When he took over they weren&#x27;t even at the races&quot;.

Kenny&#x27;s tenure as Taoiseach was dominated by the introduction of austerity policies in the aftermath of the economic recession. These policies began under the previous Fianna Fáil government in 2008, and continued for much of his first term. Overall, the impact of these budgets has been described as not conforming to &quot;either a progressive pattern (losses increasing with income) or regressive pattern (losses declining with income)&quot; by the Economic and Social Research Institute.

Despite the economic climate in which he took over, for many political pundits including Fergus Finlay and David Davin-Power, Kenny ranks high on the list of the greatest Taoisigh of all time. During his time in office, Kenny&#x27;s government regained Irish sovereignty after one of the worst economic crises in Irish history. When Kenny took office as Taoiseach in 2011, the unemployment rate for the State on a Principal Economic Status basis was 19%. By the time he stepped down as Taoiseach in 2017 the unemployment rate was just 6.4%.

In a similar vein, in Kenny&#x27;s first year in office Irish emigration levels reached 87,100 people per year. When he stepped down in 2017 this figure had reduced by nearly 30% to 64,800 people. Fewer than half of those emigrating in 2017 were Irish nationals. Kenny also oversaw a reduction of €28,837 in the Taoiseach&#x27;s salary in two separate cuts. He sold the state owned jet and cut Garda drivers for his own cabinet ministers and for all retired Taoisigh. During the 2011 election campaign Kenny vowed to make Ireland the best small country in the world to do business. By the end of his tenure as Taoiseach, various studies suggested that Ireland, even if not the best in the world, at least ranked very highly in this regard. When Enda Kenny stepped down, Ireland had the fastest-growing economy in Europe.

Enda Kenny&#x27;s insistence on the inclusion of a united Ireland clause in the Brexit negotiations could leave a lasting impact on the island of Ireland. Political Editor Daniel McConnell argues that the specific mention of Irish unity, known as &#x27;the Kenny text&#x27; in the Brexit talks agenda, was Kenny&#x27;s crowning achievement. The text spelt out that in the event of a future unity referendum in Ireland, as envisaged by the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland would automatically rejoin the European Union.

When Kenny stepped down he was the longest-serving Fine Gael Taoiseach. Political journalist John Downing wrote a biography of Kenny titled &quot;Enda Kenny: The Unlikely Taoiseach&quot;.

==Public image==
In July 2011, four months after became Taoiseach, Kenny&#x27;s approval rating was 53%, a huge increase from his predecessor Brian Cowen&#x27;s 10% when he left office. However, like Cowen, Kenny&#x27;s ratings declined. It went to 51–52% before falling to 44% then to 36% in 2012. Then his ratings fell to 30% before rising to 34% before falling to its low point of 20% when 2014 ended. However, unlike Cowen, Kenny&#x27;s approval ratings has improved since that point rising to 28% then to 31% before hovering around 30–33% before rising to 36% and then eventually leaving office with a 44% approval.

==Personal life==
Kenny has been married to Fionnuala O&#x27;Kelly since 1992. She has been described by the media as his &quot;secret weapon&quot;. O&#x27;Kelly is a first cousin to sitting Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly, who also served as a president of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). The O&#x27;Kelly family originally come from the parish of Kilcummin near Killarney, County Kerry. The couple have three children: one daughter, Aoibhinn, and two sons, Ferdia and Naoise. The couple met in Leinster House, where O&#x27;Kelly worked as a press officer for Fianna Fáil. She later worked with Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ).

Kenny has climbed Mount Kilimanjaro and completed the Ring of Kerry Charity Cycle. He is a keen supporter of his native Mayo GAA football team, and played football for his local club, Islandeady GAA, of which he is the current club president. His father Henry, won an All-Ireland medal with the county team in 1936. His grandfather was a lighthouse keeper.

In February 2023, a spokesperson for Kenny announced he had been diagnosed with cancer. Kenny had undergone a medical procedure to treat the cancer and was expected to make a full recovery.

<text>Three 6 Mafia is an American hip hop group from Memphis, Tennessee, formed in 1991. Emerging as a horror-themed underground hip hop group, they went on to enjoy mainstream success. The group&#x27;s 1995 debut album &quot;Mystic Stylez&quot; became an influential cult classic. They have released music on independent labels such as Prophet Entertainment and their own Hypnotize Minds label, as well as Relativity, Loud, and Columbia Records.

Two of their albums are RIAA-certified platinum: &quot;When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6, Sixty 1&quot; (2000) and &quot;Most Known Unknown&quot; (2005), with the latter featuring their hit single &quot;Stay Fly&quot;. In 2006 the group won the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 78th Academy Awards for their song &quot;It&#x27;s Hard out Here for a Pimp&quot; from the film &quot;Hustle &amp; Flow&quot;. The group&#x27;s latest studio album, &quot;Last 2 Walk&quot;, was released in 2008. Three 6 Mafia&#x27;s worldwide album sales stand at 5.5 million as of 2016.

==History==
===1988–1990: Origins===
Three 6 Mafia&#x27;s founding members became musicians at young ages. In 1988, DJ Paul, at age 13, was taking piano lessons, and his half-brother, Lord Infamous, age 15, was a singer practicing bass and electric guitar. The two would compose songs together, with Paul playing piano and drums while Infamous played bass and guitar and sang.

At the same time, in North Memphis, Tennessee, Juicy J, at age 13, was learning how to DJ as well as rap. He had initially wanted to be a singer, but in the late 1980s and early 1990s he fell in love with the gangsta rap style, and he, like his future founding group members across town, wanted to make music like popular artists at the time such as N.W.A and Geto Boys.

In 1989, DJ Paul and Lord Infamous formed the duo &quot;Da Serial Killaz&quot;. It was at this time they distributed their own mixtapes of popular songs at school, and Lord Infamous had started rapping with his signature triple time flow. Juicy J was also creating his own mixes by this time but was not putting his raps on tapes just yet.

===1991–1992: The beginning===
By 1991, DJ Paul had already begun to make a name for himself in the local hip-hop scene through DJing at local clubs, such as Club 380 Beale, where he got his first opportunity to perform. His mixtapes, which were gradually evolving to include more and more original content of &quot;Da Serial Killaz&quot;, also helped spread word of his talents. At the time, the hip hop scene in Memphis had not taken a fully fledged form yet, but early works by artists such as DJ Spanish Fly and DJ Squeeky were hinting at what was to come. Meanwhile, Lord Infamous was still rapping and evolving his lyrical style. In North Memphis, Juicy J was slowly building a name for himself as well, now that he was making his own songs and distributing them with his mixtapes, as well as DJing at local clubs with his mentor.

That same year, DJ Paul and Juicy J first crossed paths after Juicy sought out Paul in 1991 for help making beats. The two quickly grew fond of each-other&#x27;s musical styles and the two subsequently teamed up with Lord Infamous to form the group &quot;The Backyard Posse&quot;. DJ Paul and Lord Infamous still continued work as &quot;Da Serial Killaz&quot; by themselves, and in 1992 released the first legitimate original recording to come out of the eventual Three 6 Mafia camp, &quot;Portrait of a Serial Killa&quot;. Featuring dark beats by Paul and horrorcore-styled lyrics from Lord Infamous and DJ Paul, this tape is recognized in its raw form as a pioneering work of horrorcore hip hop. Juicy J in the meantime released his debut hard copy mixtape, &quot;Volume 5&quot;, that same year, as well as his seminal track in its original form, &quot;Slob on My Knob&quot;.

===1993–1996: Debut, &quot;Mystic Stylez&quot; and &quot;Chapter 1: The End&quot;===
The first notable release from members of the group that dropped in 1993 was DJ Paul and Lord Infamous&#x27;s &quot;Come With Me to Hell&quot;, which featured original forms of future Three 6 Mafia hits such as &quot;Tear da Club Up&quot; and &quot;Porno Movie&quot;. Paul&#x27;s &quot;DJ Paul Volume 12&quot; mixtape was also released at this time. That same year, while recording music for &quot;The Backyard Posse&quot;, Lord Infamous rapped a line referring to his crew as the &quot;Triple Six Mafia&quot;. The group later adopted the name, seeing that the name more closely matched the bleak and dark imagery of their music.

Juicy J had yet to release a notable work of his own at this point, but in 1994 that would change with &quot;Vol. 9: It&#x27;s On&quot; and &quot;Vol. 10: Chronicles of the Juice Manne&quot;. Similar to Paul and Infamous&#x27;s works the previous year, these tapes featured what would turn out to be some of the framework of future hit songs.

Also in 1994, the group added its fourth official member, rapper Koopsta Knicca (Robert Cooper Phillips). Following the addition, the group released their first unified release with the mixtape &quot;Smoked Out, Loced Out&quot;, which featured fellow budding local rappers Gangsta Blac, Kingpin Skinny Pimp, Lil Fly, 211, K-9, Lil Glock and S.O.G. That same year, Koopsta Knicca recorded the original version of what would become his first solo album, &quot;Da Devil&#x27;s Playground&quot;.

1994 also marked a significant milestone for the group, when Paul and Juicy, alongside local entrepreneur Nick Scarfo, formed Prophet, their first imprint. Through the label, the Prophet Posse was created, which was a looser collective that consisted of several local Memphis rappers who associated closely with Paul and Juicy J and ultimately signed onto the label, but were not members of Triple 6 Mafia. It was at this time when Juicy J&#x27;s older brother, Project Pat, emerged with his debut, &quot;Solo Tape&quot;.

In 1995 the group filled out when it officially added rappers Crunchy Black and Gangsta Boo. It was later this year when the group shifted its name to Three 6 Mafia and released its debut album &quot;Mystic Stylez&quot; on Prophet. The LP earned them widespread recognition and attention locally and in the southern underground hip hop scene, and as a result, Prophet landed a distribution deal with Select-O-Hits. The group&#x27;s first song on the radio was &quot;Da Summa&quot;.

In 1996, the group released &quot;Chapter 1: The End&quot;, its first non-lo-fi music record. At the helm of Prophet, DJ Paul and Juicy J would produce and release a handful of albums of some of the label&#x27;s other acts, including Gangsta Blac&#x27;s &quot;Can It Be?&quot; and Kingpin Skinny Pimp&#x27;s &quot;King of Da Playaz Ball&quot; in 1996. At the end of 1996, however, DJ Paul and Juicy J had a falling-out with Nick Scarfo, and a lengthy legal lawsuit ensued between the two sides over Prophet. It was at this time when Paul and Juicy laid the framework for Hypnotize Minds, their own independent label, which would become the powerhouse for Three 6 Mafia’s music. In 1997, Three 6 Mafia and Hypnotize Minds signed a distribution deal with Relativity.

===1997–2000: &quot;Chapter 2: World Domination&quot; and &quot;When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6 Sixty 1&quot;===
In 1997, after forming Hypnotize Minds, the group signed a deal with Sony and began working on what would become its first RIAA certified album, &quot;Chapter 2: World Domination&quot;. Polishing up their darker sound for a more palatable aesthetic while still retaining their authenticity, &quot;Chapter 2: World Domination&quot; went on to reach RIAA Gold status, selling over 800,000 copies in the United States. The LP peaked at no. 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200. The LP included the club anthem &quot;Tear Da Club Up&quot;. At this point in the group&#x27;s evolution, DJ Paul and Juicy J began expanding their brand and focused on developing Hypnotize Minds. Along with Three 6 Mafia, they brought along several artists from Prophet in their transition to Hypnotize Minds, creating the Hypnotize Camp Posse, the successor of the Prophet Posse. Over the next few years, the new label would put out and the Prophet Posse&#x27;s &quot;Body Parts&quot;, The Kaze (trio of Project Pat, M.C. Mack and Scan Man)&#x27;s &quot;Kamakazie: Timez Up&quot;, Indo G&#x27;s, &quot;Angel Dust&quot;, Gangsta Boo&#x27;s &quot;Enquiring Minds&quot;, Project Pat&#x27;s &quot;Ghetty Green&quot;, and Hypnotize Camp Posse&#x27;s self titled album (&quot;Three 6 Mafia Presents: Hypnotize Camp Posse&quot;).

In 1999, Tear da Club up Thugz, a subgroup of Three 6 Mafia members in the founding trio of DJ Paul, Juicy J, and Lord Infamous, released &quot;CrazyNDaLazDayz&quot;, which is recognized as one of if not the first album made entirely in the &quot;crunk&quot; production style. The album included Juicy J&#x27;s solo &quot;Slob On My Knob&quot; and went on to be certified Gold by the RIAA. &quot;CrazyNDaLazDayz&quot; peaked at no. 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 music chart. Later that year, group member Koopsta Knicca&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Da Devil&#x27;s Playground: Underground Solo&quot;, was released independently, although like all the Hypnotize Minds albums, was still produced by DJ Paul and Juicy J.

In 2000, the group soared to new heights in the crunk music genre, carried by their most successful LP, &quot;When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6, Sixty 1&quot;. The album went on to achieve RIAA Platinum status, a first for the group, and spawned the single &quot;Sippin&#x27; on Some Syrup&quot;, which featured UGK.

2000 represented a troubling year for the group. The Prophet Posse, which to this point had still been working closely with Hypnotize Minds in an auxiliary-type relationship, disbanded, and its members who had not made the transition to Hypnotize Minds ceased making music with Three 6 Mafia and the rest of Hypnotize Minds. Moreover, group member Koopsta Knicca was forced out of Three 6 Mafia due to ongoing legal issues, which culminated with his 2000 robbery incarceration, which voided his contract with Sony and forbade him from recording with the group. Koopsta Knicca was notably absent from the album cover of &quot;When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6 Sixty 1&quot; and music videos that accompanied tracks on the album because of his incarceration, despite still being a member of the group at the time of the album&#x27;s release.

===2001–2004: &quot;Choices&quot; and &quot;Da Unbreakables&quot;===
Despite losing Koopsta Knicca from its ranks and cutting ties officially with Prophet, Three 6 Mafia and Hypnotize Minds were still successful. In 2001, the group released the soundtrack to the DJ Paul, Juicy J and Hypnotize Minds-produced film, &quot;Choices&quot;. The soundtrack was released as a studio album and (&quot;&quot;), kept the Three 6 name and Hypnotize Minds brand growing. Moreover, Juicy and Paul successfully positioned Project Pat to become the new star of Hypnotize Minds, with his 2001 LP &quot;Mista Don&#x27;t Play: Everythangs Workin&quot; hitting #4 on the Billboard 200 and being certified Gold by the RIAA, being thus far the only Three 6 Mafia affiliate or member to release an RIAA-certified solo album.
2001 also saw Gangsta Boo leave Three 6 Mafia following the release of &quot;Choices: The Album&quot;, citing a variety of reasons including group dynamics, religion, alleged financial mismanagement and her desire to pursue a solo career.

In 2002, Juicy J and DJ Paul re-released their remastered and dramatically updated &quot;Vol. 10&quot; and &quot;Vol. 16&quot; albums respectively as &quot;Chronicles of the Juice Man&quot;, and &quot;Underground Volume 16: For da Summa&quot;. These LPs represented their solo studio LP debuts and the last piece of some of their older sound, effectively giving way to full on Crunk.

In 2003, the latest incarnation of Three 6 Mafia, DJ Paul, Juicy J, Lord Infamous, and Crunchy Black, released their album &quot;Da Unbreakables&quot;. Spawning hit singles such as &quot;Ridin&#x27; Spinners&quot; and &quot;Testin&#x27; My Gangsta&quot;, the album was a success, with the RIAA certifying it Gold by the RIAA. In 2004, Three 6 Mafia began to mobilize for what would become their domination over hip-hop. They were working on a sequel to their 2001 film, as well as another studio LP. But DJ Paul, Juicy J, and Hypnotize Minds&#x27;s Frayser Boy, were about to ink a deal with the directors of &quot;Hustle &amp; Flow&quot; to write the original track ‘It’s Hard Out Here for a Pimp‘ for the film that would ultimately result in the group winning an Oscar.

===2005–2006: Academy Award, &quot;Choices II: The Setup&quot; and &quot;Most Known Unknown&quot;===
During 2005, many members had left including Lord Infamous, and with that even more affiliates, but other acts such as Project Pat and Frayser Boy cropped up as successes to keep the camp moving forward. This moving forward reached its zenith in 2005–06 for Three 6 Mafia, wherein they became superstars of hip-hop. Firstly, they dropped the sequel to their &quot;Choices&quot; movie, &quot;Choices II: The Setup&quot;, and a studio album to go along with it that sold 400,000 copies. Secondly, they released their most commercially successful LP, &quot;Most Known Unknown&quot;, which charted at #3 on the Top 200 and went on to sell 1,600,000 copies in the United States, becoming their second album to go Platinum in America and their best selling overall. The LP featured 3 successful singles: &quot;Side 2 Side&quot;, &quot;Poppin&#x27; My Collar&quot;, and &quot;Stay Fly&quot;. &quot;Stay Fly&quot; is Three 6 Mafia&#x27;s most commercially successful song, being certified Double Platinum in America. The song featured 8Ball &amp; MJG and Young Buck. The song also peaked at no. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 music charts. &quot;Poppin&#x27; My Collar&quot;, the remix which featured Project Pat, was certified Platinum by the RIAA and peaked at no. 21 on the Billboard Top 100. Also in 2005, they released an additional film, the comedy, &quot;Clean Up Men&quot;.

Three 6 Mafia&#x27;s rise came to a head in 2006 when they became the first hip hop group to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song with &quot;It&#x27;s Hard out Here for a Pimp&quot; (which they co-wrote with Frayser Boy) as one of the theme songs for &quot;Hustle &amp; Flow&quot;. They were also the first hip hop group to perform at the ceremony, which they did with &quot;Hustle &amp; Flow&quot; actress Taraji P. Henson reprising her chorus. Right before presenter Queen Latifah announced that they had won, she chuckled and sang the refrain from the song. The energy from DJ Paul, Juicy J, Crunchy Black, and Frayser Boy&#x27;s on-stage presence and acceptance speech was infectious, causing that year&#x27;s Oscar host to quip &quot;How come they&#x27;re the most excited people here tonight? Why is that? They&#x27;re thrilled! They&#x27;re thrilled!... &quot;That&#x27;s&quot; how you accept an Oscar!&quot;

===2007–2011: &quot;Last 2 Walk&quot;===
On June 7, 2007, Sony announced the departure of Crunchy Black. He stated his primary reason for departing was to make a solo LP that DJ Paul and Juicy J had allegedly put off for years, as much of the material that he&#x27;d wanted on his solo LP was used for &quot;Most Known Unknown&quot;. Crunchy also later cited frustration over alleged financial mismanagement. Thereafter Three 6 Mafia consisted officially of DJ Paul and Juicy J.

The pair was featured along with Timbaland on fellow Memphis artist, Justin Timberlake&#x27;s single, &quot;Chop Me Up&quot; from his 2007 album &quot;FutureSex/LoveSounds.&quot;

In 2007, DJ Paul and Juicy J landed their own reality television show, &quot;Adventures in Hollyhood&quot;, on MTV. The show focused on the pair balancing fun and studio work after their Oscar win. Project Pat along with friends Big Triece &amp; Computer co-starred. The show premiered on April 5, 2007 on MTV &amp; aired for 1 season.

Three 6 Mafia released their 9th studio album &quot;Last 2 Walk&quot; on June 24, 2008, after multiple delays. The album featured collaborations with Akon, Good Charlotte, Lyfe Jennings, UGK, and 8Ball &amp; MJG among others.

After leaving Three 6 Mafia in 2005, Lord Infamous was featured on DJ Paul&#x27;s second solo album &quot;Scale-A-Ton&quot;, which was released on May 5, 2009. Lord Infamous was featured on eight tracks. Juicy J&#x27;s second solo album &quot;Hustle Till I Die&quot; was released on June 16, 2009. The LP featured Project Pat and other rappers such as V-Slash, Gucci Mane, Webbie and Gorilla Zoe.

In 2011, DJ Paul and Juicy J starred in VH1&#x27;s cooking show &quot;Famous Food&quot; together with 7 other celebrities and eventually won 1st place. In an interview published in July 2011, DJ Paul cleared up some controversy from the show, involving Ashley Alexandra Dupré, best known from the Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal.

In December 2011, Juicy J confirmed that he was the newest member of Wiz Khalifa&#x27;s Taylor Gang – as an A&amp;R and co-owner.

===2012–2018: Hiatus, Da Mafia 6ix, and independent endeavors===
By the end of 2012, Juicy J had moved completely away from Three 6 Mafia work to focus on his solo career. During this time he released a number of solo mixtapes such as &quot;Rubba Band Business&quot; and &quot;Blue Dream &amp; Lean&quot;. He also had begun frequently collaborating with Wiz Khalifa, appearing on a number of his mixtapes.

After a number of mixtapes, DJ Paul released his third solo studio album &quot;A Person of Interest&quot; on October 22, 2012. He announced that the album was a mix of gangsta rap and crunk music, with it also incorporating influences from dubstep and electronic dance music. The album featured past collaborator Gucci Mane, and also came with a bonus DVD including a self-titled short movie, music videos and behind the scenes footage.

On November 26, 2013, DJ Paul released &quot;Volume 16: The Original Masters&quot;, a remaster of his 1994 mixtape &quot;4 Da Summer of &#x27;94&quot;, on iTunes. After releasing a series of singles, including the chart topping &quot;Bandz a Make Her Dance&quot; which featured 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne, Juicy J released his third solo studio album &quot;Stay Trippy&quot; under Taylor Gang Records, Kemosabe Records and Columbia Records on August 27, 2013. Juicy J has since stated that he would still &quot;love to&quot; participate in a Three 6 Mafia album in the future.

In 2013, it was announced that five of the six original members of Three 6 Mafia – DJ Paul, Crunchy Black, Koopsta Knicca, Lord Infamous and Gangsta Boo – were reuniting to form a new group, to be known as Da Mafia 6ix, with plans to release an album which was scheduled for a March 2014 release. At the time of the formation of Da Mafia 6ix, DJ Paul clarified that the collective was &quot;not a Three 6 Mafia reunion&quot; and described it as &quot;a totally new group&quot;. The new group opted for a style reflecting their roots, focusing largely on the horrorcore foundations of their early works. Recording began in Las Vegas in late 2013. On November 12, 2013, Da Mafia 6ix released their first mixtape &quot;6iX Commandments&quot;. The tape was almost entirely produced by DJ Paul and featured 8Ball &amp; MJG, Krayzie Bone, Bizzy Bone, SpaceGhostPurrp and old HCP affiliates Kingpin Skinny Pimp and La Chat, among others. Juicy J and Project Pat also appeared as surprise guests on the posse song &quot;Body Parts&quot;, being credited just as &quot;&amp; more&quot; in the track listing. The mixtape was supported by the lead single &quot;Go Hard&quot;. The mixtape also received a retail release and debuted at number 34 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The group is managed by DJ Paul&#x27;s management team, TBA Worldwide.

On December 20, 2013, Lord Infamous died of a heart attack at home in Memphis.

Gangsta Boo would leave Da Mafia 6ix in May 2014. DJ Paul explained it saying, &quot;It was what we thought was going to be best for everybody. It just happened. Nobody forced nobody. It was a gut feeling.&quot; The reunited group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Watch What U Wish...&quot;, featured the three remaining members of the group as well as Lord Infamous, who appeared on a handful of tracks through several verses he had recorded prior to his death. The album was released on March 17, 2015. A month later, Crunchy Black was arrested for drug possession in Las Vegas. He had an outstanding arrest warrant stemming from a domestic violence charge and was sentenced to a total of 7 months in prison.

On October 9, 2015, Koopsta Knicca died after several days in urgent care following a stroke and intracranial aneurysm.

===2019–present: Reunion performances and tour===
In August 2019, group leaders DJ Paul and Juicy J announced they would soon be reviving Three 6 Mafia and reuniting for performances together for the first time in several years. The slate of performances kicked off with a show on October 12, 2019 at the Landers Center in the Memphis metropolitan area, where the group hails from. The performance featured many of the group&#x27;s biggest hits and included the other two living members of the original group, Crunchy Black and Gangsta Boo, as well as three fellow Hypnotize Camp Posse members who were so synonymous with the group that they were often incorrectly or unofficially labeled as members, Project Pat and La Chat. The series of performances, mostly taking place in the Southeastern United States, continued into 2020, and were successful to the point where DJ Paul and Juicy announced on February 12 an organized official reunion tour at locations across the United States would begin the following month. In April, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the postponement of the remainder of the tour.

The reunion performances and subsequent tour have further fueled speculation that Three 6 Mafia may come out with new music or ultimately a tenth studio album, but no timetable has been revealed.

On December 2, 2021, Three 6 Mafia competed in a &quot;Verzuz&quot; battle with longtime rival group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. DJ Paul, Juicy J, Crunchy Black, and Gangsta Boo all took part as the living representatives of the Mafia, as did all five members of Bone Thugs. Juicy J and Bizzy Bone had a verbal altercation during the event which resulted in Bizzy throwing a bottle at Juicy J and being briefly escorted off stage, before returning and apologizing to continue the show without incident. The event was highly acclaimed as one of the series&#x27; best events to date, seen as more of a celebration of old-school hip hop than a fight for supremacy.

Gangsta Boo was found dead at her mother&#x27;s home on January 1, 2023, at the age of 43. DJ Paul confirmed her death via Instagram. Her cause of death was later revealed to be an accidental overdose with fentanyl, cocaine and alcohol found in her system.

<text>Martin James Landau (; June 20, 1928 – July 15, 2017) was an American actor. His career began in the 1950s, with early film appearances including a supporting role in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959). His career breakthrough came with leading roles in the television series &quot;&quot; (1966–1969) and &quot;&quot; (1975–1977).

Landau earned Academy Award nominations for his performances in &quot;&quot; (1988) and Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; (1989). He won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor as well as the Screen Actors Guild Award and a Golden Globe Award for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi in &quot;Ed Wood&quot; (1994). Other notable roles include in &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963), &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965), &quot;Rounders&quot; (1998), &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; (1999), and &quot;Remember&quot; (2015). He headed the Hollywood branch of the Actors Studio until his death in July 2017.

==Early life and education ==
Landau was born on June 20, 1928, in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Selma (&quot;née&quot; Buchman) and Morris Landau. His family was Jewish. His father was an Austrian-born machinist who tried to rescue relatives from the Nazis.

After attending both James Madison High School and Pratt Institute, he found work at the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;. There he spent the next five years as an editorial cartoonist and worked alongside Gus Edson to produce the comic strip &quot;The Gumps&quot;. He quit the &quot;Daily News&quot; when he was 22 to concentrate on theater acting. &quot;I told the picture editor I was going into the theater,&quot; he recalled. &quot;I think he thought I was going to be an usher.&quot;

After auditioning for the Actors Studio in 1955, Landau and Steve McQueen were the only applicants accepted out of 500. While there, he trained under Lee Strasberg, Elia Kazan, and Harold Clurman, and eventually became an executive director with the Studio alongside Mark Rydell and Sydney Pollack.

==Career==
=== 1957–1965: Rise to prominence ===

Influenced by Charlie Chaplin and the escapism of the cinema, Landau pursued an acting career. While at the Actors Studio, becoming good friends with James Dean. He recalled, &quot;James Dean was my best friend. We were two young would-be and still-yet-to-work unemployed actors, dreaming out loud and enjoying every moment ... We&#x27;d spend lots of time talking about the future, our craft and our chances of success in this newly different, ever-changing modern world we were living in.&quot;

In 1957, he made his Broadway debut in &quot;Middle of the Night&quot;. Landau made his first major film appearance in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959) starring Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint. Landau portrayed Leonard, the right-hand man of a criminal portrayed by James Mason. &quot;Variety&quot; praised Landau&#x27;s performance writing, &quot;[His performance] creates individuality and excitement.&quot; That same year he acted in the Korean War film &quot;Pork Chop Hill&quot; starring Gregory Peck and directed by Lewis Milestone, and the black comedy &quot;The Gazebo&quot; starring Glenn Ford and Debbie Reynolds and directed by George Marshall. He appeared on television in &quot;Wanted: Dead or Alive&quot; S2 E19 &quot;The Monster&quot; as Khorba, a rogue elephant trainer who uses his elephant to rob miners of their gold. The series starred Steve McQueen; the episode first aired on 1/14/1960. In 1962 he acted in the Western film &quot;Stagecoach to Dancers&#x27; Rock&quot;. In 1963 he plays a survivor of a post-pandemic world in &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; episode, &quot;The Man Who Was Never Born.&quot; He returned for a second guest appearance on the series as scientist Richard Bellero in &quot;The Bellero Shield.&quot; (1964).

He had featured roles in two 1960s epics: Rufio in the Joseph L. Mankiewicz directed &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963) and Caiaphas in the George Stevens directed &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965). The latter was an historical epic which cost a reported $20 million and featured performances from stars such as Charlton Heston, Max Von Sydow, Claude Rains, Dorothy McGuire, Jose Ferrer, Roddy McDowell, and Angela Lansbury. The following year he played a ruthless killer in the Western action adventure prequel &quot;Nevada Smith&quot; (1966) starring Steve McQueen.

=== 1966–1969: &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; and acclaim ===

Landau played the supporting role of master of disguise Rollin Hand in the first three seasons of the US television series &quot;&quot;, from 1966 to 1969, for which he received three straight Emmy nominations. Landau at first declined to be contracted by the show because he did not want it to interfere with his film career; instead, he was credited for &quot;special guest appearances&quot; during the first season. He became a full-time cast member in the second season, although the studio agreed to Landau&#x27;s request to contract him only on a year-by-year basis rather than the then-standard five years. The role of Hand required Landau to perform a wide range of accents and characters, from dictators to thugs, and several episodes had him playing dual roles—not only Hand&#x27;s impersonation, but also the person whom Hand is impersonating. In the series Landau acted alongside his then-wife Barbara Bain, who won an Emmy for her performances each year for all three years. He was replaced by Leonard Nimoy, playing a very similar role but not exactly the same character, for the next two seasons of the series after Landau and Bain left the show.

===1970–1987: Movie &amp; television roles ===
During this period, Landau took few film roles and focused on television. He acted in the film &quot;They Call Me Mister Tibbs!&quot; (1970), The second installment in a trilogy, the release was preceded by &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1967) and followed by &quot;The Organization&quot; (1971). The film starred Sidney Poitier. That same year he starred in the Italian comedy film &quot;Operation Snafu&quot;. He then acted in the Spaghetti Western &quot;A Town Called Bastard&quot; (1971), and the neo-noir blaxploitation movie &quot;Black Gunn&quot; (1972). In 1973, Landau guest-starred in the &quot;Columbo&quot; episode &quot;Double Shock&quot; alongside Peter Falk, as twin brothers involved in the murder of their rich uncle. The episode also costarred Dabney Coleman, Julie Newmar, and Jeanette Nolan.

In the mid-1970s, Landau and Bain returned to TV in the British science-fiction series &quot;&quot; produced by Gerry Anderson in partnership with Sylvia Anderson, and later with Fred Freiberger. Critical response to &quot;Space: 1999&quot; was unenthusiastic during its original run, and it was canceled after two seasons. Landau was critical of the scripts and storylines, especially during the series&#x27; second season, but praised the cast and crew. He later wrote forewords to &quot;Space: 1999&quot; co-star Barry Morse&#x27;s theatrical memoir &quot;Remember with Advantages&quot; (2006) and Jim Smith&#x27;s critical biography of Tim Burton. Following &quot;Space: 1999&quot;, Landau appeared in supporting roles in a number of films and TV series. He appeared in low-budget genre pictures, such as the science fiction films &quot;Without Warning&quot; (1981) and &quot;The Being&quot; (1983) or the horror film &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; (1982). He appeared in roles in, among others, the TV film &quot;The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (1981), which co-starred Bain in their final on-screen appearance together.

=== 1989–1999: Career resurgence ===

In the late 1980s, Landau made a career comeback, earning an Academy Award nomination for his role in &quot;&quot; (1988). He said he was grateful to the film&#x27;s director, Francis Ford Coppola, for the opportunity to play a role he enjoyed: &quot;I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time playing roles that didn&#x27;t really challenge me,&quot; he said. &quot;You want roles that have dimension. The role of Abe Karatz gave me that.&quot; He won the Golden Globe Award for his part in the film. In 1989, Landau appeared in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; (1989) The film is split into two stories: one humorous, one dark in nature. Landau starred in the darker storyline as Judah Rosenthal, a successful ophthalmologist who tries to prevent his mistress, played by Anjelica Huston, from revealing their affair to his wife (Claire Bloom). Landau&#x27;s character confides his worries to patient and rabbi Sam Waterston as well as his mobster brother Jerry Orbach. Allen remembered of the cast that:

The film received critical acclaim, with Roger Ebert giving the film four stars, writing, The movie generates the best kind of suspense, because it&#x27;s not about what will happen to people—it&#x27;s about what decisions they will reach. We have the same information they have. What would we do? How far would we go to protect our happiness and reputation? How selfish would we be? Is our comfort worth more than another person&#x27;s life? Allen does not evade this question, and his answer seems to be, yes, for some people, it would be. Landau received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for this performance, losing to Denzel Washington in &quot;Glory&quot;. 

He won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in &quot;Ed Wood&quot; (1994), a biopic in which Landau plays actor Bela Lugosi. Landau researched the role of Lugosi by watching many old Lugosi movies and studying Lugosi&#x27;s Hungarian accent, which contributed to Lugosi&#x27;s decline in acting. &quot;I began to respect this guy and pity him,&quot; said Landau. &quot;I saw the humor in him. This, for me, became a love letter to him, because he never got a chance to get out of that. I got a chance to make a comeback in my career. And I&#x27;m giving him one. I&#x27;m giving him the last role he never got.&quot; Landau also received a Screen Actors Guild Award, a Golden Globe Award and a Saturn Award for the role, as well as accolades from a number of critics&#x27; groups.

Landau&#x27;s film roles in the 1990s included a down-on-his-luck Hollywood producer in the comedy &quot;Mistress&quot; (1992) with Robert De Niro, and judges in the dramas &quot;City Hall&quot; (1995) with Al Pacino, &quot;Rounders&quot; (1998) with Matt Damon, &quot;B.A.P.S.&quot; (1997) with Halle Berry, and &quot;Ready to Rumble&quot; in 2000. He played Geppetto in &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot; (1996). Landau provided the voice of Scorpion for the first two seasons of the 1990s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; television series. Landau left the series after two seasons when he won the Academy Award and lacked time for the series; Richard Moll was recast as Scorpion. He played the part of Jacob, son of Isaac, in the TV miniseries &quot;Joseph&quot;, alongside Ben Kingsley as Potiphar and Paul Mercurio as Joseph. 

=== 2000–2017: Final roles ===
He played a supporting role in &quot;The Majestic&quot; (2001), starring Jim Carrey. The film received mostly negative reviews, although one reviewer wrote that &quot;the lone outpost of authenticity is manned by Martin Landau, who gives a heartfelt performance,&quot; as an aging father who believes that his missing son has returned from World War II. In the early seasons of &quot;Without a Trace&quot; (2002–2009), Landau was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for his portrayal of the Alzheimer&#x27;s-afflicted father of FBI Special Agent in Charge Jack Malone, the series&#x27; lead character. In 2006, he made a guest appearance in the series &quot;Entourage&quot; as Bob Ryan, a washed-up but determined and sympathetic Hollywood producer attempting to relive his glory days, a portrayal that earned him a second Emmy nomination.

Landau appeared in &quot;The Aryan Couple&quot;, in which he played Joseph Krauzenberg, a very wealthy Hungarian Jewish industrial tycoon. Landau appeared in the television film &quot;Have a Little Faith&quot; (2011) based on Mitch Albom&#x27;s book of the same name, in which he played Rabbi Albert Lewis. In 2012, Landau voiced Mr. Rzykruski in the Tim Burton animated Disney film &quot;Frankenweenie&quot;. In 2015, Landau starred alongside Christopher Plummer in the film &quot;Remember&quot;. The film received critical praise, with reviewers lauding Landau&#x27;s and Plummer&#x27;s performances.

In recognition of his services to the motion picture industry, Landau has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6841 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Acting coach==
Encouraged by his own mentor, Lee Strasberg, Landau also taught acting. Actors coached by him include Jack Nicholson and Anjelica Huston.

==Personal life and death ==
Landau married actress and former co-star Barbara Bain on January 31, 1957. They had two daughters, Susan and Juliet. Landau and Bain divorced in 1993.

On July 15, 2017, Landau died at age 89 at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles; he had been briefly hospitalized. The cause of death was hypovolemic shock brought on by internal bleeding and heart disease. Landau is buried at the Beth David Cemetery in Elmont, New York.

<text>Misamis Oriental (; ; ), officially the Province of Misamis Oriental, is a province located in the region of Northern Mindanao in the Philippines. Its capital, largest city and provincial center is the city of Cagayan de Oro, which is governed independently from the province and also the regional center of Northern Mindanao.

==History==
===Spanish colonial era===
Misamis Oriental shared a history with Misamis Occidental of being part of the Province of Cebu during the Spanish colonial era. In 1818, Misamis was carved out from Cebu to become a separate province with Cagayan de Misamis &quot;(Cagayan de Oro)&quot; as its capital and was further subdivided into &quot;partidos&quot; or divisions: Partido de Cagayan (Division of Cagayan), Partido de Catarman (Division of Catarman), Partido de Dapitan (Division of Dapitan), and Partido de Misamis (Division of Misamis). The new Misamis province was part of the districts of Mindanao during the later part of the 19th Century, with its territory spanning from Dapitan to the west, Gingoog to the East, and as far as Lanao and Cotabato to the south.

Misamis is one of the Spanish-controlled territories vulnerable to Moro raids. The Fuerza de la Concepcion y del Triunfo in Ozamiz was built as a Spanish military installation and one of the staging points in their expeditions against Moros. A fort in Balo-i in present-day Lanao del Norte was also constructed in 1891 on the orders of General Valeriano Weyler in its renewed campaign against the Maranaos. The Fuerza de San Miguel in Iligan was also built, serving as a muster point for Spanish forces in their campaigns in Lanao.

===American invasion era===
====Misamis province====
With the organization of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu in 1917, Misamis lost a territory covering Iligan and coastal towns along Iligan and Panguil bays to become part of the Lanao province, making the remaining western and eastern territories of Misamis isolated from each other. Highland areas south of Cagayan de Misamis down to Malaybalay area were carved out to become a sub-province of Bukidnon in 1914, then eventually a full province in 1917. During this period migrants from Luzon and Visayas then flocked to the area to seek new and better life and various economic opportunities. Most of them are Bicolanos, Hiligaynons, Ilocanos, Kapampangans and Tagalogs in addition to Cebuanos.

&quot;Legislative Act. No. 3537&quot; approved on November 2, 1929, divided the province of Misamis into two due to the lack of geographic contiguity. It was not until a decade later, on November 28, 1939, that the division between Misamis Oriental and Misamis Occidental was implemented by &quot;Act. No. 3777&quot;. When Misamis Oriental separated, Don Gregorio Pelaez became its first governor.
===Japanese occupation era===
In 1942, at the onset of World War II in the Philippines, Japanese soldiers landed in Misamis Oriental to occupy the region. Filipino and American resistance guerrillas operated in the hills and forests of Misamis Oriental and Bukidnon, and both provinces fell under the jurisdiction of the 10th Military District commanded by Col. Wendell Fertig.

The American liberation forces landed in Cagayan in May 1945, with the support of the Filipino and American guerrillas based in Opol, Gingoog, and Tagoloan clearing the beachhead of Japanese defenders for the liberation forces to land.

===Philippine independence===
Subsequent creations of new local government units in the province occurred after the war. Opol and El Salvador were barangays of Cagayan, but due to their relative isolation from the Cagayan town proper, the residents petitioned for their separation to become municipalities in 1948. El Salvador became a municipality within the same year, while Opol was carved out from Cagayan in 1950, the same year the latter was chartered to become a city. Lagonglong was organized as a separate municipality out of the 11 sitios of Balingasag which were then grouped into 5 barangays. Villanueva was created out of the 5 barrios of Tagoloan in 1962, and the municipality of Libertad out of the 6 barrios of Initao in 1963.

The island of Camiguin was part of the province, and in 1958 it was made into a sub-province. The island eventually separated from Misamis Oriental and achieved regular province status in 1966, with Mambajao as its new provincial capital.

===During the Marcos dictatorship ===
The 21-year administration of Ferdinand Marcos, which included 14 years of one-man rule under Marcos, saw the rise of ethnic conflicts and the overall degradation of peace and order throughout Mindanao - first in the form of conflicts between local Mindanaoan Muslims and Christian settlers which the Marcos administration had encouraged first to migrate and then to form militias, and later in the form of Muslim secessionist movements arising from outrage after the 1986 Jabidah massacre.

Additionally, an economic crisis in late 1969 led to social unrest throughout the country, and violent crackdowns on protests led to the radicalization of many students, with some joining the New People&#x27;s Army, bringing the Communist rebellion to Mindanao.

During this time, Initao, Misamis Oriental was the site of the Holy Temple of Power of the Christian settler cult named Sagrado Corazon Senor (Sacred Heart of the Lord), which became better known as Tadtad (literally &quot;to chop&quot;) because of their violent actions, and was one of numerous cults tapped by Marcos&#x27; military as force multipliers in their efforts against the Muslim secessionists and the communists.

In September 1972, Marcos was nearing the end of this last term allowed under the Philippines 1935 constitution when he placed the entirety of the Philippines under Martial Law, a period historically remembered for its human rights abuses, particularly targeting political opponents, student activists, journalists, religious workers, farmers, and others who fought against the Marcos dictatorship. Only about 170 survivors from Northern Mindanao - including Misamis Oriental - were fortunate to live long enough to receive legally mandated compensation in the mid-2010s.

Others were not as fortunate, such as labor leader Julieta Cupino-Armea, a key figure in the Labor sector resistance against the Marcos dictatorship in Mindanao whom records show was &quot;tortured, raped, beaten with wood all over her body&quot; for four hours by the Tadtad before she finally died. Cupino-Armea would later be recognized as one of the martyrs of the fight to restore Philippine democracy when her name was inscribed on the wall of remembrance of the Philippines&#x27; Bantayog ng mga Bayani (lit. &quot;Monument of Heroes&quot;) in Quezon city. Another figure killed in Misamis Oriental and honored at the Bantayog ng mga Bayani was Gingoog City Councillor Renato Bucag, who was head of the opposition PDP–Laban party in Gingoog City until he, his wife, and 11-year old son were assaulted and murdered at their farm on the outskirts of the city just two weeks before the 1984 Philippine parliamentary election.

===Contemporary===
The municipality of El Salvador became a component city by virtue of &quot;Republic Act No. 9435&quot; which sought to convert the municipality into a city. The law was ratified on June 15, 2007. However, the cityhood status was lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the LCP questioned the validity of the cityhood law. The cityhood status was reaffirmed after the court finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011 which declared the cityhood law constitutional.

In May 2014 it was reported that an area in Barangay Lapad in Laguindingan, Misamis Oriental, in northern Mindanao, was declared a heritage site. Oyster fossils older than 200,000 years were discovered, according to &quot;Balita Pilipinas&quot;. Property owner, Raul Ilogon, told Balita Pilipinas that they had been seeing the fossils for 20 years thinking that they were ordinary rocks.

==Geography==
Located in Northern Mindanao, the province borders Bukidnon to the south, Agusan del Norte and Agusan del Sur to the east and Lanao del Norte to the west. On the north is the Bohol Sea with the island-province of Camiguin just off its northern coast.

Misamis Oriental occupies a total land area of . When the independent city of Cagayan de Oro is included for geographical purposes, the province&#x27;s land area is .

Misamis Oriental, as a coastal province, is dominated by two bays to the north; the Macajalar and the Gingoog Bay. The central portion of the province features several rivers originating from the highlands of Bukidnon, such as the Cagayan.
===Administrative divisions===
Misamis Oriental comprises 23 municipalities and 2 component cities, which are organized into three legislative districts and further subdivided into 424 barangays. The provincial capital, Cagayan de Oro, is a highly urbanized city that is administered independently from the province.



== Biodiversity ==
Misamis Oriental is rich in biodiversity. The Indigenous Higaonon community helps protect the natural environment on the forests of Misamis Oriental and Bukidnon. A study by the Mindanao State University attributes the biodiversity on Mount Sumagaya to the Indigenous management strategy and sustainable agriculture practiced by the Higaonon. Higaonon ancestral lands are threatened by land grabbing and land clearing.

Mount Sumagaya hosts at least 52 floral species from 19 families, including many that are considered economically and socially significant to the Higaonon people. It has a high floral diversity and is home to a threatened carnivorous pitcher plant that was first discovered in 2014. It is also home to 22 endemic species of birds, including the Philippine eagle. It also hosts various mammals, reptiles, and amphibians.

==Demographics==

The population of Misamis Oriental in the 2020 census was 956,900 people, with a density of . When Cagayan de Oro is included for geographical purposes, the province&#x27;s population is 1,564,459 people, with a density of .

===Ethnicities and languages===
Although the native inhabitants of Misamis Oriental are Higaonons, Binukid and Manobo, the majority of the province&#x27;s residents descended from earlier non-native Visayan Christian settlers from Cebu, Bohol, Negros Oriental, Siquijor and nearby Camiguin, accounting for 95.97% of the province&#x27;s population. The rest of the residents are native Higaonons, Binukid, Manobos (who became minorities in their own homeland because of the non-native Visayan majority) and neighboring Subanens (native to neighboring provinces of Misamis Occidental, parts of Lanao del Norte and northern parts of Zamboanga Peninsula), as well as Maranaos, Maguindanaons, and Tausugs and other Christian settlers (and their native-born descendants) from Ilocandia, Cagayan Valley, Cordillera Administrative Region, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Mindoro, Marinduque and Bicolandia in Luzon, and Panay and Negros Occidental in Visayas who came during the late Spanish colonial period and since the American colonial and postwar eras. These non-native settlers are informally called &quot;Dumagats&quot;, from the root word &quot;dagat&quot; (literally means &quot;sea&quot; or &quot;ocean&quot;) because they dwell among the province&#x27;s coastline upon landing from Luzon and Visayas by boats or later by ships, causing indigenous Higaonons to relocate to the mountains to avoid contact with these newcomers.

Cebuano is the primary spoken language of Misamis Oriental, with the vast majority claiming it to be their mother tongue. There are also sizeable speakers of Bohol dialect of Cebuano in the province. A unique Cebuano dialect spoken in the municipality of Jasaan is called Jasaanon. Many are fluent in Tagalog and English, which are mainly used for business, education, and administration. Maranao is also spoken among the Maranao communities within the province. Other languages that may be heard varyingly in the province include the native Binukid, Higaonon, Subanon, as well as Hiligaynon, Ilocano, Kapampangan, Maguindanaon and Tausug.

===Religion===
====Catholicism====
Roman Catholic Christianity predominates in the province with roughly 68% of the population. Other Christian denominations compose most of the minority religions that forms 9% of the population with 28% belongs to Iglesia Filipina Independiente (IFI or Aglipayan Church).

====Others====
The rest belongs to Members Church of God International (MCGI), Iglesia ni Cristo, Pentecostal church, Evangelical churches, Baptist church, United Church of Christ in the Philippines (UCCP), Seventh Day Adventist church, Episcopal church, and Presbyterian church, while Islam has a small but steadily increasing number.

==Economy==

The province is host to industries such as agricultural, forest, steel, metal, chemical, mineral, rubber and food processing. It is home to the 30 square kilometre PHIVIDEC Industrial Estate and the Mindanao International Container Port, all in Tagoloan. Del Monte Philippines, which exports pineapples all over the Asia-Pacific region, has a processing plant in Cagayan de Oro.

On January 10, 2008, Hanjin Heavy Industries and Construction Company of South Korea inked a contract to build a $2 billion shipyard building complex at Villanueva, Misamis Oriental with the PHIVIDEC Industrial Authority. It is bigger than Hanjin&#x27;s $1 billion shipyard complex in Subic and Olongapo which will hire 20,000 Filipinos to manufacture ship parts. The government declared the 441.8-hectare project site an economic zone (part of 3,000-hectare industrial estate managed by PHIVIDEC).

<text>Bone Thugs-n-Harmony (formerly known as B.O.N.E. Enterpri$e and also referred to as simply Bone Thugs or Bone) is an American R&amp;B/hip hop group consisting of rappers Bizzy Bone, Wish Bone, Layzie Bone, Krayzie Bone, and Flesh-n-Bone. Formed in 1991 in Cleveland, Ohio, the group signed with American rapper Eazy-E&#x27;s Ruthless Records in late 1993 and made their debut with the EP &quot;Creepin on ah Come Up&quot; the following year. 

In 1995, they released their second album, &quot;E. 1999 Eternal&quot;, which included the hit singles &quot;1st of tha Month&quot; and &quot;East 1999&quot;. Their song &quot;Tha Crossroads&quot;, a tribute to their recently deceased mentor Eazy-E, earned them a Grammy Award in 1997. The group&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Art of War&quot;, was released in 1997. In 2000, their album &quot;BTNHResurrection&quot; achieved platinum status in the United States within a month of its release, whereas their 2002 album, &quot;Thug World Order&quot;, saw more moderate success, attaining platinum certification and peaking at 3 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. After this release, the group took a hiatus from their label and subsequently released their sixth studio album, &quot;Thug Stories&quot;, independently in 2006. In 2007, they returned with a major-label release, &quot;Strength &amp; Loyalty&quot;, through American producer Swizz Beatz&#x27;s label, Full Surface Records, in partnership with Interscope Records. Bone Thugs-n-Harmony followed this with their 2010 album, &quot;Uni5: The World&#x27;s Enemy&quot;, released under their own label, BTNH Worldwide, with distribution provided by Warner Bros..

Krayzie Bone and Wish Bone briefly parted ways with the group in April 2011 to focus on their independent label, The Life Entertainment. Both members, however, soon reunited with the group.

In August 2013, Layzie Bone also announced a temporary departure to concentrate on his independent label, Harmony Howse Entertainment. He too rejoined the group shortly thereafter.

In the same month, BTNH signed a new deal with eOne Music (formerly known as Koch Records), with whom they had previously collaborated for the release of &quot;Thug Stories&quot; in 2006.

==History==
===1993: B.O.N.E. Enterprise early years===
Formed in Cleveland, Ohio in 1991, the group was originally called &quot;Band Aid Boys&quot;. Charles Scruggs Jr., born 17 February 1975, joined the trio of Krayzie Bone, Layzie Bone, and Bizzy Bone under the name Wish Bone (later stylized as Wi$h Bone), and the group recorded an album titled &quot;Faces of Death&quot; under the name B.O.N.E. Enterpri$e after an obsolete Inglewood, California based group Layzie Bone was associated with. The album was recorded in the studio of their then-mentor, Kermit Henderson, and released on his indie label Stoney Burke in 1993. Like so many aspiring rappers around the country, they put in calls to executives at record companies, hoping to find someone who would listen. In hopes of securing a record deal, the group was given an audition over the phone, receiving an unfulfilled promise from rapper Eazy-E to call them back. Determined to reach him, they scrounged together the money for one-way bus tickets to Los Angeles. They left for a three-day Greyhound trek and spent four months on the city streets, putting in frequent calls to find him. Nothing came of their search except the news that Eazy-E was, in fact, on his way to Cleveland for a show.

The quartet returned to Ohio, where Diego Blak (born Diego Hodge), a marketer and promoter who had been co-executive producer of &quot;Faces of Death&quot;, introduced them to Eazy-E at a concert he promoted in Compton. There, on November 2, 1993, they auditioned for Eazy in his dressing room; Krayzie performed his verse of &quot;Flow Motion&quot; from the &quot;Faces of Death&quot; album, and Eazy was impressed. B.O.N.E Enterpri$e then traveled back to Los Angeles after the Cleveland show to seal the deal. At this point, Eazy renamed them Thugs-n-Harmony, but as they wanted to keep the Bone name, they made their name Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. Eazy signed the group (minus Flesh-n-Bone) to his label Ruthless Records.

===1994: &quot;Creepin on ah Come Up&quot;===
Released in June 1994, &quot;Creepin on ah Come Up&quot; was Bone Thugs-n-Harmony&#x27;s debut with Ruthless. The album&#x27;s subject matter was focused almost entirely on violent criminal activity. Peaking at 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 Albums chart and 2 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, it included the hit singles &quot;Thuggish Ruggish Bone&quot; and &quot;Foe tha Love of $&quot;, the second of which featured a verse by Eazy-E. &quot;Thuggish Ruggish Bone&quot; peaked at 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and 2 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart, and &quot;Foe tha Love of $&quot; peaked at 39 on the Hot 100 and 4 on Rap Tracks. After a slow start that saw the album&#x27;s success limited to gangsta rap audiences, it broke through to the mainstream. The EP marked a major change in style for the group, as they now fully embraced the G-funk common in West Coast hip hop of the time. Beats were supplied by DJ Yella, Rhythum D, and Kenny McCloud, and it was the group&#x27;s first collaboration with newcomer producer DJ U-Neek, who would craft the group&#x27;s signature sound by producing the majority of their next two albums. For over a year, Eazy-E nurtured their career, continuing to serve as their executive producer and teaching them the business skills he had taught himself over the years. The growing relationship was cut short, however, when Eazy-E died on March 26, 1995, from complications from AIDS-related pneumonia. Briefly, the young rappers thought they had lost everything with the loss of their friend and mentor. However, the group&#x27;s potential was apparent, and Ruthless Records continued to support them.

===1995–1996: &quot;E. 1999 Eternal&quot;===
In 1995, the group&#x27;s second album, &quot;E. 1999 Eternal&quot;, was released. It included the singles &quot;1st of tha Month&quot;, which peaked at 12 on the Hot 100 and 4 on Hot Rap Tracks, and &quot;Tha Crossroads&quot;, which reached 1 on both the Hot 100 and Hot Rap Tracks charts. The album generally saw positive reviews from critics as Bone had diversified its content and musical style. Critics were particularly intrigued by the album due to Bone Thugs-n-Harmony&#x27;s ability to reduce the banality associated with gangsta rap in their music at a time when the subgenre had become exceedingly cliché. A considerable portion of the album&#x27;s concept was built upon violent subject matter, yet they also incorporated deeper themes, as its songs dealt with more spirituality and occult mysticism. The album was produced by DJ U-Neek (with co-production from Tony C. and Kenny McCloud). &quot;E. 1999 Eternal&quot; also introduced Bone&#x27;s trademark tracks devoted entirely to the use of marijuana. The album name originated from one of the street names of a corner (E. 99th street and St. Clair) that was a familiar hangout to Bone members, as well as Eazy-E&#x27;s album &quot;Eternal E&quot;. Naming it after Eazy-E&#x27;s album was just another way of showing respect and tribute to the rapper who had helped them reach success. Also in 1996, Flesh-n-Bone would become the first member of the group to release a debut album, titled T.H.U.G.S, which was certified gold by the RIAA. In 1996, due to their success, the Cleveland clan established their own label, Mo Thugs Records, and released the &quot;Family Scriptures&quot; compilation album to introduce many of the Cleveland-based and other artists whom they were developing. &quot;E. 1999 Eternal&quot; is the group&#x27;s most commercially successful album; it has been certified 4x platinum by the RIAA.

There were plans for Bone Thugs-n-Harmony to collaborate with West Coast rapper 2Pac on a studio album titled &quot;One Nation&quot;. The project brought hip hop artists from all areas of the American map such as Boot Camp Clik, OutKast, Scarface, E-40, and more. However, 2Pac was shot and killed in September 1996 so the album never came into fruition. Bootlegs of songs produced while 2Pac was still alive have been distributed.

===1997–2001: &quot;The Art of War&quot; and &quot;BTNHResurrection&quot;===
In 1997, the group released the double-disc set &quot;The Art of War&quot;. Bone explored a variety of subjects and styles, with focus on God and family and an overall ambient, mellow sound. The group incorporated violent lyrics, however, with a large portion of the album dedicated to what they labeled &quot;clones&quot; who claimed Bone had stolen their quick-tongued rapping style and vice versa. The album had been rumored to be titled &quot;DNA Level C&quot; which is Cleveland backwards. The single &quot;Look into My Eyes&quot; appeared on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;. It peaked at 4 on the Hot 100 and 2 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart. &quot;If I Could Teach the World&quot;, the other single from &quot;The Art of War&quot;, peaked at 20 on the Hot 100 and 3 on the Hot Rap Tracks, and won an American Music Award. The album also included &quot;Thug Luv&quot; with Tupac Shakur. The group&#x27;s promotional efforts were dampened by the absence of Bizzy Bone from the album&#x27;s videos and from large portions of the ensuing tour and other public appearances. This absence eventually fueled rumors of a break-up.

Around this time, the lyrical content of some of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony&#x27;s songs came under scrutiny, with their music being involved in the criminal trials of Michael Tisius and Mitchell Johnson.

In 2000, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony released &quot;BTNHResurrection&quot;, featuring the single &quot;Resurrection (Paper, Paper)&quot;, which peaked on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart at 52. The album&#x27;s first half featured a slew of hardcore and dark tracks, with the second half being considerably more introspective and soft. Other singles from the album, including &quot;Can&#x27;t Give it Up&quot;, failed to crack the Billboard Hot 100, and the big-budget video for &quot;Change the World&quot; failed to receive any rotation. This was their first group album to prominently feature Flesh-n-Bone, whose presence had been limited on previous releases because he had never signed with the group&#x27;s label, Ruthless Records. Flesh was convicted for assault with a firearm and criminal possession of a weapon in June 2000. Pleading guilty, Flesh was sentenced to 11 years in prison.

The group again began having public disputes with Bizzy Bone. Bizzy Bone abstained from promoting &quot;BTNHResurrection&quot; because he felt that Ruthless Records owed him money. He dropped a million-dollar lawsuit he had filed against Sony Music and Loud Records in exchange for a termination of his Sony contract. Three members of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony released solo albums in 2001: Bizzy Bone with &quot;The Gift&quot;, Layzie Bone (under the name L-Burna) with &quot;Thug by Nature&quot;, and Krayzie Bone with &quot;Thug on da Line&quot;.

===2002–2006: &quot;Thug World Order&quot; and &quot;Thug Stories&quot;===
In 2002, the group released &quot;Thug World Order&quot;. This album, comprising what were described &quot;politically slanted&quot; songs, saw a drastic change in subject matter and tone for the group. The lyrics were almost completely void of any violence, while a larger number of tracks focused on the group itself. In contrast, several songs originally intended to be included on the album that were leaked after its release portrayed a much different album. The album debuted at 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The first single released from the album was &quot;Money, Money&quot; and the second was &quot;Get Up &amp; Get It&quot;, featuring 3LW. The third single, &quot;Home&quot;, which featured Phil Collins performing part of his song &quot;Take Me Home&quot;, peaked at 33 on the Rhythmic Top 40, impacting the charts in a number of countries, most notably the United Kingdom. Bizzy Bone was expelled from the group in January 2003, leaving only 3 active members: Krayzie Bone, Layzie Bone, and Wish Bone. &quot;Thug World Order&quot; was also Bone Thugs-n-Harmony&#x27;s final album with Ruthless Records.

&quot;Thug Stories&quot;, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony&#x27;s seventh album, was recorded on Koch Records and released on September 19, 2006. It marked the first time Bone Thugs-n-Harmony had recorded as a trio since they released an internet-only EP album called &quot;Bone 4 Life&quot; in September 2005. &quot;Thug Stories&quot; featured a slightly more mature style, and the group leaned more heavily towards its harmonic roots than its &quot;thug&quot; origins. The album sold 38,000 in its first week and peaked at 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and 1 on the Independent Albums chart.

===2007: &quot;Strength &amp; Loyalty&quot; and &quot;T.H.U.G.S.&quot;===
Originally to be titled &quot;The Bone Thugs Story&quot;, &quot;Strength &amp; Loyalty&quot; was released on May 8, 2007, on Interscope Records imprint Full Surface Records. Being their first major album after an absence of nearly five years, the album debuted at 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and 1 on iTunes and the &quot;Billboard&quot; urban music charts. The album contains guest appearances by Mariah Carey, the Game, will.i.am, Akon, Twista, Bow Wow, Yolanda Adams, and Felecia. Producers on the album included Swizz Beatz, Akon, Pretty Boy, Bradd Young, DJ Toomp, Jermaine Dupri, will.i.am, and others. The executive producer of the album was Swizz Beatz. The first single was &quot;I Tried&quot;, which was their first top-10 hit in 10 years, peaking at number 6 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The second single was &quot;Lil Love&quot;, which failed to reach the success of its predecessor. The album has been certified gold by the RIAA.

2007 also saw the release of the semi-autobiographical film &quot;I Tried&quot;, directed by Rich Newey, which explored what might have happened to Bone Thugs-n-Harmony had they not gotten their break with Eazy-E. Layzie, Krayzie, and Wish Bone starred in the film, playing themselves. Also in 2007, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony won the American Music Award for Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Band, Duo or Group.

&quot;T.H.U.G.S.&quot;, an album featuring previously unreleased, largely remixed Bone Thugs-n-Harmony songs that hadn&#x27;t made the final cut of &quot;BTNHResurrection&quot; and &quot;Thug World Order&quot;, was released on November 13, 2007, by their former record label Ruthless Records. Although the album embodies old tracks, there are some notable changes: new beats, distorted production, voice manipulation, and new song titles. The sole single off the album was &quot;Young Thugs&quot;, which was accompanied by a newly filmed music video featuring Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, and Wish.

In November 2007, Layzie Bone confirmed that he had completed &quot;Bone Brothers III&quot; with Bizzy Bone, spurring speculation about a full Bone reunion. In a video interview, Krayzie Bone stated that they all wanted to reunite, but that record label issues might prevent an official reunion.

After nearly a decade of incarceration, Flesh-n-Bone was released from prison on July 13, 2008. In an interview, Bizzy confirmed his return, the group having reunited in time for Flesh&#x27;s release.

===2010–2013: &quot;Uni5: The World&#x27;s Enemy&quot; and &quot;The Art of War: World War III&quot;===
Bone Thugs-n-Harmony&#x27;s five members officially returned with their new album &quot;Uni5: The World&#x27;s Enemy&quot;, released on May 4, 2010, by their own record label BTNH Worldwide, with distribution by Warner Bros. &quot;Uni5&quot; also marks the return of long-time Bone collaborator DJ U-Neek, who was absent from 2007&#x27;s &quot;Strength &amp; Loyalty&quot; but had produced for the group throughout their career, including hits &quot;Thuggish Ruggish Bone&quot; and &quot;Tha Crossroads&quot;. They released the singles &quot;See Me Shine&quot;, featuring Jay Rush and Lyfe Jennings, and &quot;Rebirth&quot;, featuring Thin-C, a member of the Mo Thugs. A third single, &quot;Meet Me in the Sky&quot;, was released on March 22.

Throughout 2011, Krayzie Bone, Bizzy Bone, and Layzie Bone spoke about many projects coming in 2012. Those projects were to include an anniversary album featuring all five members; a Bizzy/Krayzie duet album; and compilation albums of unreleased Bone Thugs-n-Harmony material from the mid to late 1990s and 2000s, prospectively titled &quot;Lost Archives Vol. 1&quot;. The group put their differences aside to reunite and belatedly mark their 20th anniversary at the Rock the Bells festival series of summer 2012.

During Summer 2012, West Coast rapper Game sampled Bone Thugs-n-Harmony&#x27;s &quot;1st Of Tha Month&quot; on his posse cut &quot;Celebration&quot;, with the group&#x27;s blessing. Game also posted a picture on Twitter showing the word &quot;bone&quot; constructed out of cannabis. He later confirmed that he was working in the studio with Bone Thugs-n-Harmony on a remix of &quot;Celebration&quot; for his album &quot;Jesus Piece&quot;.

In early November 2013, Krayzie Bone told HipHopDX that the &quot;Art of War III&quot; album would feature only Layzie, Bizzy, and Flesh-n-Bone and that neither he nor Wish Bone had recorded any material for that album. However, Krayzie and Wish both appeared on the album in the form of previously unreleased tracks that had been cut from &quot;Uni5: The World&#x27;s Enemy&quot;. &quot;The Art of War: World War III&quot; was released on December 10, 2013.

===2014–present: New album, &quot;New Waves&quot;, signing with Greenback Records===
On July 15, 2014, it was announced that Bone Thugs-n-Harmony would release their final album in 2015. There would be only a single copy released, to be auctioned off, with bidding starting at $1 million. The group also announced they would be conducting a 20-country world tour beginning in December 2014. The following day, Krazyie Bone revealed that the album would be titled &quot;E. 1999 Legends&quot;. He then told &quot;XXL&quot; that he had approached the group about a reunion album in the middle of the previous year, and they had begun recording it at the end of 2013. Krayzie estimated that Bone Thugs-n-Harmony probably recorded 75 to 100 songs since they began work on the album, which was planned as a double-disc project. The first disc was to contain Bone Thugs-n-Harmony content exclusively, with no features, and would have 18–20 songs. The second disc was planned to feature a large number of big-name guest appearances such as Mariah Carey, Kendrick Lamar, Phil Collins, Wiz Khalifa, Drake, A$AP Mob, and Linkin Park, along with beats from Dr. Dre and DJ U-Neek, who had each been tapped for the album. Damizza would be producing/overseeing the entire &quot;E. 1999 Legends&quot; album, which was projected to be distributed through Damizza&#x27;s Baby Ree Records label.

On February 14, 2015, producer and long-time Bone collaborator Damizza officially presented the single &quot;More Than Thugs&quot;. In August 2015, Krayzie announced that the first bid of at least $1 million had been received for &quot;E. 1999 Legends&quot;.

In 2017, Krayzie Bone and Bizzy Bone announced that they would release their long-awaited duet album together titled &quot;New Waves&quot; under the name Bone Thugs. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Coming Home&quot; featuring Stephen Marley was released on March 24. Krayzie confirmed that the full Bone Thugs-n-Harmony group was working on a new album, but said that they would no longer be auctioning off the album&#x27;s rights. All five members of the group would appear on rapper Wiz Khalifa&#x27;s 2018 album &quot;Rolling Papers 2&quot;, each providing a verse for the song &quot;Reach for the Stars&quot;. In early 2020, the group announced that they were changing their name to Boneless Thugs-n-Harmony in a promotion for Buffalo Wild Wings. Bizzy Bone later dismissed that the change was anything serious.

On December 2, 2021, Bone competed in a &quot;Verzuz&quot; battle with longtime rival group Three 6 Mafia, where all five Bone Thugs and all four still-living Mafia members took part, accompanied by many guests the two groups worked with over their careers. Bizzy was escorted off stage at one point for throwing a bottle at Juicy J, but soon returned and apologized as the show resumed without incident. The event was highly acclaimed as one of the series&#x27; best events to date, seen as more of a celebration of old-school hip hop than a fight for supremacy.

On July 21, 2024, the group announced on social media they had officially signed with Greenback Records, a new record label founded by mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor.

<doc id="261061" wikidata="Q4774628" url="?curid=261061" title="Anticipatory democracy">
<text>Anticipatory democracy is a theory of civics relying on democratic decision making that takes into account predictions of future events that have some credibility with the electorate. The phrase was coined by Alvin Toffler in his book &quot;Future Shock&quot; and was expanded on in the 1978 book &quot;Anticipatory Democracy&quot;, edited by Clement Bezold.

Other well-known advocates of the anticipatory approach include Newt Gingrich, Heidi Toffler, K. Eric Drexler, and Robin Hanson. They all advocate approaches where the public, not just experts, participate in this &quot;anticipation&quot;.

The FutureMAP program of the Information Awareness Office program of the United States government proposed a prediction market prior to its cancellation on July 29, 2003.

== Variants ==

Bioregional democracy can appear as a variant of anticipatory democracy in that it anticipates (using a similar scientific process) the ecological health outcomes of any given action. However it usually relies more on far less fragile means, and less on compared measures and quantities.

An alternative, deliberative democracy, may combine with either the anticipatory or the bioregional model. It relies less on formal models and a market system for betting on future events, and more on discussion.

Deliberative, anticipatory and bioregional approaches can all be considered variants of participatory democracy with different thresholds of ease of participation, burden of proof, concern for non-human life or future generations, and reflection of participants&#x27; tolerances versus preferences or ideals of truth. Sometimes a deliberative model is described as more &quot;left&quot; and an anticipatory model as more &quot;right&quot;. Those who wish to avoid this debate and see merits to both approaches, e.g. Greens, usually prefer the generic term &quot;participatory democracy&quot;. This term has become fundamental to green politics itself.
Other terms which likewise have more specific associations with advocates or methods include: grassroots democracy, semi-direct democracy, consensus democracy.

<doc id="261062" wikidata="Q310988" url="?curid=261062" title="Participatory democracy">
<text>Participatory democracy, participant democracy, participative democracy, or semi-direct democracy is a form of government in which citizens participate individually and directly in political decisions and policies that affect their lives, rather than through elected representatives. Elements of direct and representative democracy are combined in this model.

== Overview ==
Participatory democracy is a type of democracy, which is itself a form of government. The term &quot;democracy&quot; is derived from the from δῆμος/&quot;dēmos&quot; &#x27;people&#x27; and κράτος/&quot;kratos&quot; &#x27;rule&#x27;. It has two main subtypes, direct and representative democracy. In the former, the people have the authority to deliberate and decide legislation; in the latter, they choose governing officials to do so. While direct democracy was the original concept, its representative version is the most widespread today.

Public participation, in this context, is the inclusion of the public in the activities of a polity. It can be any process that directly engages the public in decision-making and gives consideration to its input. The extent to which political participation should be considered necessary or appropriate is under debate in political philosophy.

Joining political parties allows citizens to participate in democratic systems, but is not considered participatory democracy.

Participatory democracy is primarily concerned with ensuring that citizens have the opportunity to be involved in decision-making on matters that affect their lives. It is not a new concept and has existed in various forms since the Athenian democracy. Its modern theory was developed by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in the 18th century and later promoted by John Stuart Mill and G. D. H. Cole, who argued that political participation is indispensable for a just society. In the early 21st century, participatory democracy has been more widely studied and experimented with, leading to various institutional reform ideas such as participatory budgeting.

==History==
=== Origins ===

Democratic processes have been practiced throughout history.

Probably the earliest well-documented example of large-scale democracy comes from the city-state of Athens during classical antiquity. It was first established under Cleisthenes in 508–507 BC. This was a direct democracy, in which ordinary citizens were randomly selected to fill government administrative and judicial offices, and there was a legislative assembly consisting of all Athenian citizens. Athenian citizens controlled the entire political process through the assembly, the boule and the courts, and a large proportion of citizens were involved constantly in public matters. However, Athenian citizenship excluded women, slaves, foreigners (μέτοικοι/&quot;métoikoi&quot;) and youths below the age of military service.

=== During the 20th century ===
During the 20th century, practical implementations began to take place, mostly on a small scale, attracting considerable academic attention in the 1980s. Experiments in participatory democracy took place in various cities around the world. For example, Porto Alegre, Brazil adapted a system of participatory budgeting in 1989. A World Bank study found that participatory democracy in these cities seemed to result in considerable improvement in the quality of life for residents.

=== In the 21st century ===
In the early 21st century, experiments in participatory democracy began to spread throughout South and North America, China, and across the European Union. In a US example, the plans to rebuild New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 were drafted and approved by thousands of ordinary citizens.

==== The Citizens&#x27; Assembly (2011) in Ireland ====
In 2011, as a response to citizens&#x27; growing distrust in the government following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Ireland authorised a citizens&#x27; assembly called &quot;We the Citizens&quot;. Its task was to pilot the use of a participatory democratic body and test whether it could increase political legitimacy. There was an increase in both efficacy and interest in governmental functions, as well as significant opinion shifts on contested issues like taxation.

==== The Citizens Convention for Climate in France (2019) ====
The French government organised &quot;le grand débat national&quot; (the Great National Debate) in early 2019 as a response to the Yellow vests movement. It consisted of 18 regional conventions, each with 100 randomly selected citizens, that had to deliberate on issues they valued the most so that they could influence government action. After the debate, a citizens&#x27; convention was created specifically to discuss climate change, &quot;la Convention citoyenne pour le climat&quot; (the Citizens Convention for Climate, CCC), designed to serve as a legislative body to decide how the country could reduce its greenhouse gas emissions with social justice in mind. It consisted of 150 citizens selected by sortition and stratified sampling, who were sorted into five sub-groups to discuss individual topics. The members were helped by experts on steering committees. The proceedings of the CCC garnered international attention. After nine months, the convention outlined 149 measures in a 460-page report, and President Macron committed to supporting 146 of them. A bill containing these was submitted to the parliament in late 2020.

==== Effects of social media ====
In recent years, social media has led to changes in the conduct of participatory democracy. Citizens with differing points of view are able to join conversations, mainly through the use of hashtags. To promote public interest and involvement, local governments have started using social media to make decisions based on public feedback. Users have also organised online committees to highlight local needs and appoint budget delegates who work with the citizens and city agencies.

===== The Occupy movement =====
Participatory democracy was a notable feature of the Occupy movement in 2011. &quot;Occupy camps&quot; around the world made decisions based on the outcome of working groups where every protester had a say. These decisions were then aggregated by general assemblies. This process combined equality, mass participation, and deliberation.

== Evaluation ==

=== Strengths ===

The most prominent argument for participatory democracy is its function of greater democratization.

With participatory democracy, individuals or groups can realistically achieve their interests, &quot;[providing] the means to a more just and rewarding society, not a strategy for preserving the status quo.&quot;

Participatory democracy may also have an educational effect. Greater political participation can help increase its efficacy and depth: &quot;the more individuals participate the better able they become to do so&quot;, an idea already promoted by Rousseau, Mill, and Cole. Pateman emphasises this potential as it counteracts the widespread lack of faith in the capacity and capability of citizens to meaningfully participate, especially in societies with complex organisations. Joel D. Wolfe asserts his confidence that such models could be implemented even in large organizations, progressively diminishing state intervention.

=== Criticism ===

Criticisms of participatory democracy generally align with criticism of democracy. The main opposition is the disbelief in citizens&#x27; capabilities to bear the greater responsibility. Some reject the feasibility of participatory models and refute its proposed educational benefits.

Critics conclude that the citizenry is disinterested and leader-dependent, making the mechanism for participatory democracy inherently incompatible with advanced societies.

Other concerns are whether such massive political input can be managed and turned into effective output. David Plotke highlights that the institutional adjustments needed to make greater political participation possible would require a representative element. Consequently, both direct and participatory democracy must rely on some type of representation to sustain a stable system. He also states that achieving equal direct participation in large and heavily populated regions is hardly possible, and ultimately argues in favor of representation over participation, calling for a hybrid between participatory and representative models.

A third category of criticism, primarily advanced by author Roslyn Fuller, rejects equating or even subsuming instruments of Deliberative Democracy (such as citizens’ assemblies) under the term of Participatory Democracy, as such instruments violate the hard-won concept of political equality (One Man, One Vote), in exchange for a small chance of being randomly selected to participate and are thus not ‘participatory’ in any meaningful sense.

Proponents of deliberative democracy in her view misconstrue the role sortition played in the ancient Athenian democracy (where random selection was limited only to offices and positions with very limited power whereas participation in the main decision-making forum was open to all citizens).

Fuller&#x27;s most serious criticism is that deliberative democracy purposefully limits decisions to small, externally controllable groups while ignoring the plethora of e-democracy tools available which allow for unfiltered mass participation and deliberation.

Business philosopher Jason Brennan advocates in book &quot;Against Democracy&quot; for a less participatory system because of the irrationality of voters in a representative democracy. He proposes several mechanisms to reduce participation, presented with the assumption that a vote-based system of electoral representation is maintained. Comparing an untested voter to an unlicensed driver, Brennan argues that exams should be administered to all citizens to determine if they are competent to participate in public matters. Under this system, citizens either have one or zero votes, depending on their test performance. Critics of Brennan, including reporter Sean Illing, found parallels between his proposed system and the literacy tests of the Jim Crow laws that prevented black people from voting in the United States. Brennan proposes a second system in which all citizens have equal rights to vote or otherwise participate in government, but decisions made by the elected representatives are scrutinized by an epistocratic council. This council could not make law, only &quot;unmake&quot; it, and would likely be composed of individuals who pass rigorous competency exams.

== Mechanisms of participatory democracy ==
Scholars have recently proposed several mechanisms to increase citizen participation in democratic systems. These methods intend to increase the agenda-setting and decision-making powers of the people by giving citizens more direct ways to contribute to politics.

=== Citizens&#x27; assemblies ===

Also called mini-publics, citizens&#x27; assemblies are representative samples of a population that meet to create legislation or advise legislative bodies. When citizens are chosen to participate by stratified sampling, the assemblies are more representative of the population than elected legislatures. Assemblies chosen by sortition provide average citizens with the opportunity to exercise substantive agenda-setting and/or decision-making power. Over the course of the assembly, citizens are helped by experts and discussion facilitators, and the results are either put to a referendum or sent in a report to the government.

In studying the perceived legitimacy of citizens&#x27; assemblies, political scientist Daan Jacobs finds that the perceived legitimacy of assemblies is higher than that of system with no participation, but not any higher than that of any system involving self-selection. Regardless, the use of citizens&#x27; assemblies has grown throughout the early 21st century and they have often been used in constitutional reforms, such as in British Columbia&#x27;s Citizens&#x27; Assembly on Electoral Reform in 2004 and the Irish Constitutional Convention in 2012.

=== Deliberative opinion polls ===

 Trademarked by Stanford professor James S. Fishkin, deliberative opinion polls allow citizens to develop informed opinions before voting through deliberation. Deliberative polling begins with surveying a random representative sample of citizens to gauge their opinion. The same individuals are then invited to deliberate for a weekend in the presence of political leaders, experts, and moderators. At the end, the group is surveyed again, and the final opinions are taken to be the conclusion the public would have reached if they had the opportunity to engage with the issue more deeply. Philosopher Cristina Lafont, a critic of deliberative opinion polling, argues that the &quot;filtered&quot; (informed) opinion reached at the end of a poll is too far removed from the opinion of the citizenry, delegitimizing the actions based on them.

=== Public consultation surveys ===
Public consultation surveys are surveys on policy proposals or positions that have been put forward by legislators, government officials, or other policy leaders. The entirety of the deliberative process takes place within the survey. For each issue, respondents are provided relevant briefing materials and arguments for and against various proposals.  Respondents then provide their final recommendation.  Public consultation surveys are primarily done with large representative samples, usually several thousand nationally and several hundred in subnational jurisdictions.    

Public consultation surveys have been used since the 1990s in the US.  The American Talks Issue Foundation led by Alan Kay played a pioneering role.  The largest such program is the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland&#x27;s School of Public Policy, directed by Steven Kull, conducting public consultation surveys on the national level, as well as in states and congressional districts. They have gathered public opinion data on over 300 policy proposals that have been put forward by Members of Congress and the Executive Branch, in a variety of areas. Such surveys conducted in particular Congressional districts have also been used as the basis for face-to-face forums in congressional districts, in which survey participants and House Congressional Representative discuss the policy proposals and the results of the survey.

The questionnaires used in the surveys by the Program for Public Consultation, which they call “policymaking simulations”, have also been made available for public use, as educational and advocacy tools. Members of the public can take the policymaking simulations to better understand the proposal, and are given the option to send their policy recommendations to their elected officials in Congress.

=== E-democracy ===
E-democracy is an umbrella term describing a variety of proposals to increase participation through technology. Open discussion forums provide citizens the opportunity to debate policy online while facilitators guide discussion. These forums usually serve agenda-setting purposes or are sometimes used to provide legislators with additional testimony. Closed forums may be used to discuss more sensitive information: in the United Kingdom, one was used to enable domestic violence survivors to testify to the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Domestic Violence and Abuse while preserving their anonymity.

Another e-democratic mechanism is online deliberative polling, a system in which citizens deliberate with peers virtually before answering a poll. The results of deliberative opinion polls are more likely to reflect the considered judgments of the people and encourage increased citizen awareness of civic issues.

=== Liquid democracy ===
In a hybrid between direct and representative democracy, liquid democracy permits individuals to either vote on issues themselves or to select issue-competent delegates to vote on their behalf. Political scientists Christian Blum and Christina Isabel Zuber suggest that liquid democracy has the potential to improve a legislature&#x27;s performance through bringing together delegates with a greater awareness on a specific issue, taking advantage of knowledge within the population. To make liquid democracy more deliberative, a trustee model of delegation may be implemented, in which the delegates vote after deliberation with other representatives.

Some concerns have been raised about the implementation of liquid democracy. Blum and Zuber, for example, find that it produces two classes of voters: individuals with one vote and delegates with two or more. They also worry that policies produced in issue-specific legislatures will lack cohesiveness. Liquid democracy is utilized by Pirate Parties for intra-party decision-making.

=== Participatory budgeting ===
Participatory budgeting allows citizens to make decisions on the allocation of a public budget. Originating in Porto Alegre, Brazil, the general procedure involves the creation of a concrete financial plan that then serves as a recommendation to elected representatives. Neighbourhoods are given the authority to design budgets for the greater region and local proposals are brought to elected regional forums. This system lead to a decrease in clientelism and corruption and an increase in participation, particularly amongst marginalized and poorer residents. Theorist Graham Smith observes that participatory budgeting still has some barriers to entry for the poorest members of the population.

=== Referendums ===

In binding referendums, citizens vote on laws and/or constitutional amendments proposed by a legislative body. Referendums afford citizens greater decision-making power by giving them the ultimate decision, and they may also use referendums for agenda-setting if they are allowed to draft proposals to be put to referendums in efforts called popular initiatives. Compulsory voting can further increase participation. Political theorist Hélène Landemore raises the concern that referendums may fail to be sufficiently deliberative as people are unable to engage in discussions and debates that would enhance their decision-making abilities.

Switzerland currently uses a rigorous system of referendums, under which all laws the legislature proposes go to referendums. Swiss citizens may also start popular initiatives, a process in which citizens put forward a constitutional amendment or propose the removal of an existing provision. Any proposal must receive the signature of 100,000 citizens to go to a ballot.

=== Town meetings ===
In local participatory democracy, town meetings provide all residents with legislative power. Practiced in the United States, particularly in New England, since the 17th century, they assure that local policy decisions are made directly by the public. Local democracy is often seen as the first step towards a participatory system. Theorist Graham Smith, however, notes the limited impact of town meetings that cannot lead to action on national issues. He also suggests that town meetings are not representative as they disproportionately represent individuals with free time, including the elderly and the affluent.

<text>François Girardon (; 17 March 1628 – 1 September 1715) was a French sculptor of the Louis XIV style or French Baroque, best known for his statues and busts of Louis XIV and for his statuary in the gardens of the Palace of Versailles.

==Biography==
He was born at Troyes. His father was a foundry worker. He was first trained as a joiner and woodcarver. His talent attracted the attention of the Chancellor of Louis XIV, Pierre Séguier, a serious patron of the arts, who arranged for him to work in the studio of François Anguier, and later, from 1648 to 1650 to live and apprentice in Rome. There he saw Baroque sculpture and met Bernini, but he came to reject that style and moved instead toward classicism and the models of ancient Roman sculpture.

In 1650 he returned to France, and became a member of the group of artists, led by Charles Le Brun, the official painter of the King, and including the garden designer André Le Nôtre, who were commissioned to decorate the new royal park of the Chateau of Versailles. His principal contribution was the group of statuary representing &quot;Apollo served by the Nymphs&quot;, (1666-1675), symbolizing the Sun King himself, placed in a grotto close to the Palace. The figure of Apollo was inspired in form by the &quot;Apollo Belvedere&quot; of the Vatican, and featured two groups of figures; Apollo surrounded by nymphs, and a second group, next to the grotto, showing &quot;The Horses of the Sun&quot; being conducted to their royal stable.

He created another fountain for Versailles, the &quot;Basin of Saturn&quot; or &quot;Winter&quot; (1672-1677), made of gilded lead, composed in a more baroque style, crowded with figures. His third major work at Versailles was the &quot;Kidnapping of Proserpine&quot;. This group of statues was located away from the center of the garden, and was designed to be seen from a single point of view. The sense of movement and twisted figures give it a Baroque appearance, but this is balanced by the classical clarity and symmetry of the composition.

Girardon rose steadily in the official artistic hierarchy. He became a member of the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture in 1657, was raised to professor, in 1674 assistant to the Rector. In 1690, on the death of Le Brun, he became inspector general of works of sculpture, governing all royal sculptural commissions. In 1695, he became Chancellor of the Royal Academy.

In 1675 he received another important commission, for the tomb of Cardinal Richelieu, located in the Chapel of the Sorbonne. It was completed in 1694. The figure of the Cardinal is shown seated on the tomb but alive, sitting up and looking toward the altar. (The tomb was originally placed in the choir of the church, but has since been moved to a separate chapel). He is accompanied by figures of two grieving women representing Religion and science. The tomb was completed in 1694, and had considerable influence on the design of later funeral sculpture. It was nearly destroyed by a mob during the French Revolution, but was protected by the archeologist Alexandre Lenoir, who received a bayonet wound in its defense. He had it moved to safety in the first museum of French monuments.

In 1699, Girardon completed another major work, a bronze equestrian statue of Louis XIV, which was placed in the center in the center of Place Louis le Grand (now Place Vendôme). This statue was melted down during the French Revolution and is now known only by a small bronze model made by Girardon himself, in the Louvre, He died in Paris in 1715.
Other notable work of Girardon that can still be seen include Tomb of Louvois in the Church of (St-Eustache) in Paris; the tomb of Bignon, the King&#x27;s librarian, made in 1656, in (St-Nicolas du Chardonnet); and decorative sculptures in the Gallery of Apollo and the King&#x27;s Bedroom in the Louvre.

The municipal museum of his birthplace of Troyes has several of his works, marble busts of Louis XIV and Maria Theresa. The Town Hall displays a medallion of Louis XIV, and the Church of Saint Remy displays a bronze crucifix he made.

<text>Hugh Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk (1095–1177) was the second son of Roger Bigod (also known as Roger Bigot) (died 1107), sheriff of Norfolk and royal advisor, and Adeliza, daughter of Robert de Todeni.

==Early years==
After the death of his elder brother William, who perished without issue in the sinking of the &quot;White Ship&quot; on 25 November 1120, Hugh was allowed to inherit his brother&#x27;s office of royal steward and many estates in East Anglia. He also succeeded his aunt Albreda, heiress of her brother Berengar de Tosny, with lands in Yorkshire, including Kirkstall Abbey, and in Normandy. Hugh became Constable of Norwich Castle in 1122.

==During King Stephen&#x27;s reign==
Hugh initially supported Stephen of Blois as king of England. On the death of Henry I in 1135, his nephew Stephen usurped the throne, despite the oath Stephen and the barons had sworn to accept Henry&#x27;s daughter Empress Matilda as his successor. It was Bigod who asserted that, in his last days, Henry I had named Stephen to become king at the expense of his daughter Matilda. Civil war resulted when, in 1139, Matilda commanded the military strength necessary to challenge Stephen within his own realm.

King Stephen initially had the support of the English barons, but in 1136 he was stricken with sickness and a report of his death was quickly spread abroad. Hugh Bigod seized and held Norwich castle. Stephen, quickly recovering, laid siege to the city and Hugh was compelled to surrender. In February 1141 Bigod fought on Stephen&#x27;s side in the First Battle of Lincoln, after which the Earl deserted the captured king. In July of that year, he was granted the earldom of Norfolk by the Empress Matilda but he appears to have assumed a position of armed neutrality during the civil war, rather than actively siding with the supporters of the empress.

As Earl of Norfolk, Bigod&#x27;s landholdings included Castle Acre, Geldeston and Hethel as well as land at Earl Soham, Framlingham, and Thetford

He supported his first wife&#x27;s brother-in-law, Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex, during his rebellion against King Stephen in 1143–44. During the disagreement between King Stephen and Archbishop Theobald in 1148, Hugh Bigod sided with the archbishop and received him in his stronghold, his Castle of Framlingham, but joined with others in negotiating a reconciliation between the king and the archbishop.

==Rise of King Henry II==
Five years later, in 1153, when Henry, Duke of Normandy, soon to become King Henry II (r. 1154–89), landed in England to assert his claim to the throne, Bigod held out in Ipswich against Stephen&#x27;s forces, while Henry II, on the other side, laid siege to Stamford. Both places fell to Stephen. In the critical state of his fortunes, however, Stephen was in no position to punish the rebel earl. Negotiations between the two parties resulted in Henry&#x27;s recognition as Stephen&#x27;s heir and Hugh eluded retaliation.

On Henry II&#x27;s accession in December 1154, Bigod received confirmation of the possession of his earldom and office of royal steward by a charter issued apparently in January of the next year. The first years of the new reign were spent in restoring order to the shattered kingdom and in breaking the power of the independent barons, which had grown out of control during King Stephen&#x27;s reign.

It was not long before Bigod became agitated under the rule of law initiated by Henry. He grew restless with measures such as the scutage, a fee paid by vassals in lieu of military service, which became the central feature of Henry II&#x27;s military system of operation by 1159. The Earl showed signs of resistance but was at once put down. In 1157 Henry II marched into the eastern counties and received the earl&#x27;s submission.

After this incident Hugh Bigod makes no significant appearances in the chronicles for some time; he is named among those who had been excommunicated by Becket, in consequence of his retention of lands belonging to the monastery of Pentney in Norfolk.

==The revolt of 1173==
In 1173 the young Crown Prince Henry (also known as Henry the Young King) raised a revolt against his father Henry II. This gave Hugh Bigod a fresh occasion for rebellion, with the English barons and the kings of France and Scotland leagued in his favour. He at once became a leader in the cause, being eager to revive his feudal power which Henry II had curtailed, and because the conflict which inevitably resulted was, at least in England, centred upon his own territorial possessions. The custody of Norwich Castle was promised by the young prince as his reward.

The king&#x27;s energy and good fortune were equal to the occasion. While he held in check his rebel vassals in France, the loyal barons in England defeated his enemies there. Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester (died 1190) landed at Walton, in Suffolk, on 29 September 1173 and marched to Framlingham, joining forces with Hugh. Together they besieged and took the castle of Hagenet in Suffolk on 13 October, held by Randal de Broc for the crown. But the Earl of Leicester was defeated and taken prisoner setting out from Framlingham at the Battle of Fornham, near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, by the justiciar Richard de Luci and other barons. These then turned their arms against Earl Hugh, who, not being strong enough to fight, opened negotiations with his assailants. It is said he bought them off, and at the same time secured a safe passage home for the Flemings in his service.

==Final days==
Though defeated and compelled to surrender his castles, Bigod kept his lands and his earldom, and lived at peace with Henry II until his death reportedly in 1177 in Palestine.

On 1 March 1177, his son Roger Bigod appealed to the king on a dispute with his stepmother. Hugh was dead at the time of Roger&#x27;s appeal, the date of his father&#x27;s death is fixed &quot; &#x27;ante caput jejunii&#x27;, &quot; (i.e. before 9 March). If, then, he died in Palestine, his death must have taken place in the preceding year, 1176, to allow time for the arrival of the news in England. Henry II took advantage of Roger&#x27;s appeal to seize upon the late Earl&#x27;s treasure. Earl Hugh had possessed vast estates, which he inherited, and was also the recipient of the third penny of judicial fines levied in the county of Norfolk by right of his earldom.

==Marriage and family==
Bigod married firstly to Juliane de Vere (died c. 1199). She was the daughter of Aubrey de Vere II and Adeliza de Clare, the daughter of Gilbert Fitz Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Clare. The marriage was dissolved before 1156. They had one son:
*Roger Bigod, 2nd Earl of Norfolk (born c. 1144–5). He married Ida de Tosny, had issue.

Bigod married secondly Gundreda (c. 1135–1200), daughter of Roger de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Warwick. They had two children:
* Hugh Bigod (born c. 1156)
* William Hugh Bigod (born 1168)

<text>Beaver Creek is a community in Yukon, Canada. Located at kilometre 1870.6 (historical mile 1202) of the Alaska Highway, southeast of Beaver Creek Airport and close to the Alcan - Beaver Creek Border Crossing, it is Canada&#x27;s westernmost community. The community&#x27;s main employers are a Canada Border Services Agency port, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Detachment, the White River First Nation and a number of tourist lodges.

It is the home of the White River First Nation. The First Nation is made up of Upper Tanana speaking people whose traditional territory extends from the Donjek River into neighbouring Alaska, and Athapaskan Northern Tutchone speaking people whose traditional territories included the lower Stewart River and the area south of the Yukon River on the White and Donjek River drainages.
In addition to the Alaska Highway, the community is served by the Beaver Creek Airport.

The CBSA station is the furthest from the border crossing of any Canadian customs station at a distance of , and at least up to the 1990s, some individuals lived in the &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot; in between the border and customs. Prior to 1983, the customs station was located in the middle of the community, with the resulting confusion: individuals driving past without stopping, and locals with a new vehicle not being recognized as they drove by.
==Climate==

Like most of Yukon, Beaver Creek has a subarctic climate (Dfc), and NRC Plant Hardiness Zone of 0a. It is situated at an elevation of approximately .

<text>Total physical response (TPR) is a language teaching method developed by James Asher, a professor emeritus of psychology at San José State University. It is based on the coordination of language and physical movement. In TPR, instructors give commands to students in the target language with body movements, and students respond with whole-body actions.

The method is an example of the comprehension approach to language teaching. Listening and responding (with actions) serves two purposes: It is a means of quickly recognizing meaning in the language being learned, and a means of passively learning the structure of the language itself. Grammar is not taught explicitly but can be learned from the language input. TPR is a valuable way to learn vocabulary, especially idiomatic terms, e.g., phrasal verbs.

Asher developed TPR as a result of his experiences observing young children learning their first language. He noticed that interactions between parents and children often took the form of speech from the parent followed by a physical response from the child. Asher made three hypotheses based on his observations: first, that language is learned primarily by listening; second, that language learning must engage the right hemisphere of the brain; and third, that learning language should not involve any stress.

TPR is often used alongside other methods and techniques. It is popular with beginners and with young learners, although it can be used with students of all levels and all age groups.

== Background ==

James Asher developed the total physical response (TPR) method as a result of his observation of the language development of young children. Asher saw that most of the interactions that young children experience with parents or other adults combine both verbal and physical aspects. The child responds physically to the speech of the parent, and the parent reinforces the child&#x27;s responses through further speech. This creates a positive feedback loop between the parent&#x27;s speech and the child&#x27;s actions. Asher also observed that young children typically spend a long time listening to language before ever attempting to speak, and that they can understand and react to utterances that are much more complex than those they can produce themselves.

From his experiences, Asher outlined three main hypotheses about learning second languages that are embodied in the TPR method. The first is that the brain is naturally predisposed to learn language through listening. Specifically, Asher says that learners best internalize language when they respond with physical movement to language input. Asher hypothesizes that speech develops naturally and spontaneously after learners internalize the target language through input, and that it should not be forced. In Asher&#x27;s own words:

A reasonable hypothesis is that the brain and the nervous system are biologically programmed to acquire language, either the first or the second in a particular sequence and in a particular mode. The sequence is listening before speaking and the mode is to synchronise language with the individual&#x27;s body.

The second of Asher&#x27;s hypotheses is that effective language learning must engage the right hemisphere of the brain. Physical movement is controlled primarily by the right hemisphere, and Asher sees the coupling of movement with language comprehension as the key to language acquisition. He says that left-hemisphere learning should be avoided, and that the left hemisphere needs a great deal of experience of right-hemisphere-based input before natural speech can occur.

Asher&#x27;s third hypothesis is that language learning should not involve any stress, as stress and negative emotions inhibit the natural language-learning process. He regards the stressful nature of most language-teaching methods as one of their major weaknesses. Asher recommends that teachers focus on meaning and physical movement to avoid stress.

The main text on TPR is James Asher&#x27;s &quot;Learning Another Language through Actions&quot;, first published in 1977.

== Principles ==
TPR is an example of the comprehension approach to language teaching. Methods in the comprehension approach emphasize the importance of listening to language development and do not require spoken output in the early stages of learning. In TPR, students are not forced to speak. Instead, teachers wait until students acquire enough language through listening that they start to speak spontaneously. At the beginning stages of instruction students can respond to the instructor in their native language.

While the majority of class time is spent on listening comprehension, the ultimate goal of the method is to develop oral fluency. Asher sees developing listening comprehension skills as the most efficient way of developing spoken language skills.

Lessons in TPR are organized around grammar, and in particular around the verb. Instructors issue commands based on the verbs and vocabulary to be learned in that lesson. However, the primary focus in lessons is on meaning, which distinguishes TPR from other grammar-based methods such as grammar-translation.

Grammar is not explicitly taught, but is learned by induction. Students are expected to subconsciously acquire the grammatical structure of the language through exposure to spoken language input, in addition to decoding the messages in the input to find their meaning. This approach to listening is called &quot;codebreaking&quot;.

TPR is both a teaching technique and a philosophy of language teaching. Teachers do not have to limit themselves to TPR techniques to teach according to the principles of the method.

Because the students are only expected to listen and not to speak, the teacher has the sole responsibility for deciding what input students hear.

== Procedure ==

The majority of class time in TPR lessons is spent with language-body conversations as Asher refers to it, in which the instructor gives commands using the imperative mood. Students respond to these commands with physical actions. Initially, students learn the meaning of the commands they hear by direct observation. After they learn the meaning of the words in these commands, the teacher issues commands that use novel combinations of the words the students have learned in which they respond with a physical action modeled by the instructor. For instance, if the teacher says, &quot;Stand up and clap.&quot; students watch the instructor model the utterance before they act it out themselves to show comprehension.

Instructors limit the number of new vocabulary items given to students at any one time. This is to help students differentiate the new words from those previously learned, and to facilitate integration with their existing language knowledge. Asher suggests that students can learn between 12 and 36 words for every hour of instruction, depending on their language level and class size.

While procedures using the imperative are the mainstay of classes, teachers can use other activities as well. Some typical other activities are role plays, skits, storytelling and slide presentations. However, beginners are not made to learn conversational dialogs until 120 hours into their course.

There is little error correction in TPR. Asher advises teachers to treat learners&#x27; mistakes the same way a parent would treat their children&#x27;s. Errors made by beginning-level students are usually overlooked, but as students become more advanced teachers may correct more of their errors. This is similar to parents raising their children; as children get older parents tend to correct their grammatical mistakes more often.

According to Asher, TPR lesson plans should contain the detailed commands that the teacher intends to use. He says, &quot;It is wise to write out the exact utterances you will be using and especially the novel commands because the action is so fast-moving there is usually not time for you to create spontaneously.&quot;

== Teaching materials ==

TPR lessons typically use a wide variety of , posters, and props. Teaching materials are not compulsory, and for the very first lessons they may not be used. As students progress in ability the teacher may begin to use objects found in the classroom such as furniture or books, and later may use word charts, pictures, and realia.

There are a number of specialized TPR teaching products available, including student kits and storytelling materials developed by Asher and other authors.website www.tpr-world.com

== Research ==

Asher conducted a large number of scientific studies to test and refine his hypotheses and the teaching practices in TPR. When testing children and adults learning Russian, Asher and Price found that the adults outperformed the children. TPR is one of the most thoroughly researched approaches in the field. All of the pertinent research is summarized in Asher&#x27;s Learning Another Language Through Actions book. 

Research performed in Turkey in 2018 on TPR by Adnan Oflaz showed that using the method can significantly reduce anxiety in students. Over the course of Oflaz&#x27;s research of using the TPR method for two hours a week over a six-week period, &quot;those [students] whose anxiety levels were high and those who experienced anxiety very close to high level ... went down to medium level.&quot; Oflaz also observed that the students were more willing to speak in German (which was the target language), that they didn&#x27;t purposefully avoid situations in which they needed to speak in the target language, and that some students were even &quot;eager to take turns to speak.&quot;

== Reception ==
According to the &quot;Routledge Encyclopedia of Language Teaching and Learning&quot;, TPR is often criticized as being only suitable for beginning students. However, the encyclopedia goes on to note that there are several publications available about how to use TPR with intermediate and advanced students.

According to its proponents, TPR has a number of advantages: Students enjoy getting out of their chairs and moving around. Simple TPR activities do not require a great deal of preparation on the part of the teacher. TPR is aptitude-free, working well with a mixed ability class, and with students having various disabilities. It is good for kinesthetic learners who need to be active in the class. Class size need not be a problem, and it works effectively for children and adults.

However, it is recognized that TPR is most useful for beginners, though it can be used at higher levels where preparation becomes an issue for the teacher. It does not give students the opportunity to express their own thoughts in a creative way. Further, it is easy to overuse TPR—&quot;Any novelty, if carried on too long, will trigger adaptation.&quot; It can be a challenge for shy students. Additionally, the nature of TPR places an unnaturally heavy emphasis on the use of the imperative mood, that is to say commands such as &quot;sit down&quot; and &quot;stand up&quot;. These features are of limited utility to the learner, and can lead to a learner appearing rude when attempting to use their new language. As a TPR class progresses, group activities and descriptions can extend basic TPR concepts into full communication situations.

Because of its participatory approach, TPR may also be a useful alternative teaching strategy for students with dyslexia or related learning disabilities, who typically experience difficulty learning foreign languages with traditional classroom instruction.

== Influence ==
Teachers who use TPR typically use it together with a variety of other activities and techniques. In line with Asher&#x27;s recommendations for using the approach, it is most often used for introducing new vocabulary. This is the case in The Polis Institute, a school for ancient languages and the humanities in Jerusalem (Israel), which employs TPR within the Polis Method of teaching ancient and modern languages.

Blaine Ray, a Spanish language teacher, added stories to TPR to help students acquire non-physical language, creating the foundation of the method known as Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling (TPRS) built on Stephen Krashen&#x27;s theories of language acquisition. It should be clarified that TPRS, which stands for &quot;Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling, is not directly associated with &quot;Total Physical Response&quot; (TPR) in spite of the similarity of their names.

Todd McKay conducted the first empirical study of the effectiveness of Total Physical Response (TPR) combined with storytelling. Stories had been incorporated into TPR as early as 1972. In the comparative study with Asher, McKay found that children who were exposed to TPR Storytelling outperformed similar students trained using grammar-translation and ALM. The ability of those students to comprehend a never before heard story was statistically (p-value of 0.001) greater than that of the control group. This study can be found in McKay&#x27;s TPR Storytelling Teacher&#x27;s Guidebook.

<text>Camiguin, officially the Province of Camiguin (; ; Kamigin: &quot;Probinsya ta Kamigin&quot;), is an island province in the Philippines located in the Bohol Sea, about off the northern coast of mainland Mindanao. It is geographically part of Region X, the Northern Mindanao Region of the country and formerly a part of Misamis Oriental province.

Camiguin is the second-smallest province in the country in both population and land area after Batanes. The provincial capital is Mambajao, which is also the province&#x27;s largest municipality in both area and population.

The province is famous for its sweet lanzones, to which its annual Lanzones Festival is dedicated and celebrated every third weekend of October. It is home to lush interior forest reserves, collectively known as the Mount Hibok-Hibok Protected Landscape, which has been declared by all Southeast Asian nations as an ASEAN Heritage Park. The province also boasts three National Cultural Treasures, namely, the Old Bonbon Church ruins in Catarman, the Sunken Cemetery of Catarman, and the Spanish-era watchtower in Guinsiliban. The three sites were declared for “possessing outstanding historical, cultural, artistic and/or scientific value which is highly significant and important to the country and nation.”

Additionally, the island province has numerous Important Cultural Treasures, such as the Old Mambajao Fountain - situated in the town&#x27;s rotonda, the Old Mambajao Municipal Building, the façade of the Santo Rosario Church in Sagay, and 14 heritage and ancestral houses. The sites were declared for “having exceptional cultural, artistic and historical significance to the Philippines.” All cultural treasures were declared by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts. There have been moves to establish a dossier nomination for the province to be included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.

Camiguin is sometimes called Camiguin Sur (&quot;South Camiguin&quot;) or Camiguin de Mindanao to distinguish it from Camiguin de Babuyanes of the Babuyan Islands, which in turn is referred to as Camiguin Norte (&quot;North Camiguin&quot;). Both are volcanic islands.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Camiguin&quot; is derived from the native word &quot;Kamagong&quot;, a species of ebony tree that thrives near Lake Mainit in the province of Surigao del Norte, in the mainland Mindanao, where the earlier inhabitants of the islands, the Manobos, originated. Kamigin, the local dialect of Camiguin, is the northernmost variant of the Manobo languages.

An earlier Spanish geography book spells the island as &quot;Camiguing&quot;. There is reason to suppose the Spaniards dropped the final &quot;g&quot;, given how the phoneme does not exist in Spanish. Today it is rendered as &quot;Camiguín&quot;.

==History==
===Early history===
The island of Camiguin is believed to have been first inhabited by the Manobo people of Surigao del Norte, as evidenced by the distinctly connected language between the two groups. The island was used as a trading stop point by various merchants and traders from the Rajahnate of Butuan, the Kedatuan of Dapitan, the ancient people of the Anda peninsula, and possibly the Rajahnate of Cebu and the animist Maranao of Lanao before the Islamization of the Lanao provinces.

===Spanish colonial era===
Old Spanish documents indicate that the explorers Ferdinand Magellan and Miguel Lopez de Legaspi landed in Camiguin in 1521 and 1565, respectively. The first Spanish settlement was established in 1598 in what is now Guinsiliban. Guinsiliban, which comes from the old Kinamiguin word &quot;Ginsil-ipan&quot; (which means “to look out for pirates from a watchtower”) has an old Spanish watchtower where the Camiguinons kept watch for Moro pirates.

The first major Spanish settlement, established in 1679, was called &quot;Katagman&quot; or &quot;Katadman&quot; (known as Catarman). The settlement grew and prospered but was destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Vulcan in 1871. The former location is what is now &quot;Barangay Bonbon&quot; of Catarman.

Sagay, located south of Catarman, was formally established as a town in 1848. The word &quot;Sagay&quot; is derived from the name of poisonous fruit trees that grow in the area. Mambajao became a town in 1855. The name was coined from the Visayan terms &quot;mamahaw&quot;, meaning to usher breakfast, and &quot;bajao&quot;, which is leftover boiled rice. In the early 1900s, Mambajao prospered and became the busiest port in Northern Mindanao. Mahinog was established as a municipality in 1860. The name &quot;Mahinog&quot; comes from a Visayan word meaning &quot;to ripen&quot; or &quot;to become ripe&quot;. Although Guinsiliban was the oldest settlement in the island, it was only in 1950 that it became a municipality. Mahinog was formerly governed by Mambajao while Guinsiliban was formally governed from Sagay.

===American invasion era===
In 1901, in the middle of the Philippine–American War, American soldiers landed in Camiguin to assume political control over the island. A group of Camiguinons, armed with bolos and spears, led by &quot;Valero Camaro&quot;, fought them in a short battle in Catarman. Valero Camaro was killed by a bullet in the forehead. Further study is needed before he and his band can be recognized as patriots in the same way the Katipuneros are recognized. There is no study that identifies an independence movement in Camiguin during the American occupation. However, a small detail with regards to the colonial resistance in Cagayan, Misamis indicates that Camiguinons supported in a clandestine way the revolutionary activities of the Cagayanons against the new colonizers. They offered their arms and ammunitions and a typewriter to the revolucionarios in Cagayan. In the same year, Camiguin became part of the newly established province of Misamis by virtue of Act No. 128.

In 1903, the first public school in Camiguin was built in Mambajao but what is known today as the Mambajao Central School was completed in 1912. On September 9, 1904, the first public water system, known as Las Aguas Potables de Mambajao, spearheaded by an admired civic leader by the name of Placido Reyes and co-operated by townspeople, was inaugurated.

In 1929, Camiguin Island became part of Oriental Misamis when Misamis was divided into two provinces by virtue of Act No. 3537. The change took effect on January 1, 1930.

===Japanese occupation era===
On June 18, 1942, the Japanese Imperial Army landed in Camiguin and set up a government in Mambajao. They gutted central Mambajao in reprisal to guerrilla activities in the area. The remains of some of these buildings still exist today.

===Postwar era===
On July 4, 1946, the Philippines gained independence from the United States. On June 22, 1957, Camiguin formally became a subprovince of Misamis Oriental through Republic Act No. 2021 signed by President Carlos P. Garcia.

Finally, on June 18, 1966, Camiguin was made into a separate province through Republic Act No. 4669 which was formally signed in 1968.

===Martial Law dictatorship era===

The beginning months of the 1970s had marked a period of turmoil and change in the Philippines, with many implications for Camiguin. During his bid to be the first Philippine president to be re-elected for a second term, Ferdinand Marcos launched an unprecedented number of foreign debt-funded public works projects. This caused the Philippine economy took a sudden downwards turn known as the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis, which in turn led to a period of economic difficulty and a significant rise of social unrest. 

In 1972, one year before the expected end of his last constitutionally allowed term as president in 1973, Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law. This allowed Marcos to remain in power for fourteen more years, during which Camiguin went through many social and economic ups and downs. Camiguinon citizens were among those who were victims of the human rights abuses during Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos; some of them were among the Northern Mindanaoans whose grievances were formally recognized and granted the right to reparations in 2014.

=== Recent history ===
In 2004, an area in the core of the island which included the Mambajao and its highest peak Mount Timpoong, as well as Mount Catarman including the active volcano Mount Hibok-Hibok, as a protected area named the Timpoong and Hibok-Hibok Natural Monument. Proclamation 570 s. 2004, which created the monument, also set aside its adjacent areas as &quot;buffer zones&quot; for the protection of the area. During the 13th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on the Environment in 2015, the Timpoong and Hibok-Hibok monument was formally declared an ASEAN Heritage Park.

==Geography==

The province consists primarily of Camiguin Island, as well as a few other surrounding minor islets including:
* White Island, about west of the town of Mambajao
* Mantigue Island, about south of Mambajao.

===Physical===
Camiguin Island is a pearl-shaped island with an area of approximately . The island measures about at its longest and at its widest breadth. The island is mountainous with the highest elevation reaching over . It is encircled by a national road with a length of about . As of the August 1, 2007, census, the province has a fifth-class income classification with a population of 81,293.

===Administrative divisions===
Camiguin comprises five municipalities, which are further subdivided into a total of 58 barangays.


==Demographics==
The population of Camiguin in the 2020 census was 92,808 people, with a density of .

The people of Camiguin are called &quot;Camiguingnon&quot; or &quot;Camiguinon&quot; (). Cebuano is the most spoken language in the province, although Kinamigin is considered to be the indigenous language. Today, Kinamigin is still spoken by a few people in the municipalities of Sagay and Guinsiliban. Other languages spoken varyingly include Boholano dialect of Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Ilocano, Kapampangan and Waray. Tagalog and English are also widely spoken and understood by the local population.

=== Indigenous people ===
An indigenous people group, the Cinamiguin Manobo, are believed to have been the first inhabitants of Camiguin. Their language, known as Kamigin, had 26,700 speakers as of the 2000 census.

===Religion===
====Catholicism====
Camiguin is a predominantly Roman Catholic province with 95% adherence.

====Others====
Other religions are represented by various Protestant and a few Islamic groups.
==Economy==
The economy is based upon fishing and farming, with copra providing the greatest income contribution. Lanzones has since then became the main agricultural product of the island province. Other agricultural products are abaca, rice, mangoes and other fruit trees. The growing tourism industry has improved the economy of the province. Small cottage industries have increased in number to accommodate the influx of visitors.

==Education==
Camiguin has three colleges, all located in Mambajao: Fatima College of Camiguin (FCC), Camiguin Polytechnic State College (CPSC), with a satellite campus in Catarman, and Camiguin School of Arts and Trades (CSAT). A complete secondary and elementary education is provided as well, both in private and public schools. There are also day care centers offering nursery and pre-school education.

The province has a total number of 68 day care centers managed by the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and 56 public and private elementary schools. There are 13 secondary schools, 3 private institutions and the rest government-owned. There is one special school, which accommodates underprivileged or special children, the Family-to-Family School and Farm, which is managed by a Non-Government Organization (NGO).

The Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) also offers vocational courses, as well as the Alternative Learning System Education Sector which helps individuals through its literacy and livelihood program.

==Man-made attractions==
===Lanzones Festival===
Each year in the third week of October, a festival is held to celebrate the Lanzones (locally called bwahan/buahan), a small grape-sized tropical fruit grown all over the island. Lanzones grown in Camiguin is considered to be the sweetest. The unique flavor is due to the richness of the volcanic soil. The week-long Lanzones Festival is one of numerous colorful events in the Philippines.

===Churches===
Several centuries-old Spanish Colonial and 20th century churches are found in various parts of the island.

* Santo Rosario Church: The Santo Rosario Church in the municipality of Sagay was built in 1882. The facade of the church is a declared &quot;Important Cultural Property&quot; of the Philippines.
* Old Bonbon Church Ruins of Catarman: The church of the Old Bonbon was destroyed and partly submerged by volcanic debris during the eruption and formation of Mount Vulcan from 1871 to 1875. Also known as Gui-ob Church, only the ruins of the church and bell tower remain of the old town. A modern white lighthouse was recently erected close to the bell tower. The archaeological site has been declared as a National Cultural Treasure of the Philippines.
* Baylao Church: The Church located in Barangay Baylao in Mambajao is claimed to be miraculous and the saving of many lives during the last volcanic eruption of Hibok-hibok is attributed to it.

===Old ancestral homes===
Beautiful and ornate ancestral homes dating back to the Spanish Colonial Period and American Colonial Period are still abundant and can be found along the streets of Camiguin. Fourteen of these heritage houses have been declared as &quot;Important Cultural Properties&quot; of the Philippines. These include the Borromeo ancestral house, Bacut ancestral house, Luspo ancestral house, Neri ancestral house, Nery ancestral house, Nerio-Chan ancestral house, Corrales ancestral house, Corrales y Gamali ancestral house, Francisco ancestral house, Juni ancestral house and Lim ancestral house, and Catalino Chan and Eleuterio Chan ancestral houses.

===Other structures===
The province is dotted with numerous heritage structures and zones from the classical, Spanish, and American eras, but most of its heritage sites are from the 300-year Spanish colonial era.

*Sunken Cemetery of Catarman – an ancient cemetery which sank beneath the sea due to a volcanic eruption. The archaeological site has been declared as a &quot;National Cultural Treasure&quot; of the Philippines.
*Spanish-era watchtower in Guinsiliban – the watchtower of Guinsiliban was one of the most important in the area during the Spanish colonial era. The watchtower has been declared as a &quot;National Cultural Treasure&quot; of the Philippines.
*Old Mambajao Fountain – a unique-style fountain from the Spanish era. It has been declared an &quot;Important Cultural Property&quot; of the Philippines.
*Old Mambajao Municipal building – a well-preserved Spanish-era government building which has been declared an &quot;Important Cultural Property&quot; of the Philippines.

==Natural attractions==

===Volcanoes===
The island of Camiguin is of volcanic origin composed of four stratovolcanoes. Each volcano (except Mount Guinsiliban) is made up of several flank domes. The only volcano on the island with historical eruptions is Hibok-Hibok, which last erupted in 1953.

Below is the list of volcanoes, arranged with respect to location from north to south:

* Mount Hibok-Hibokand Mount Vulcanare the northernmost and the only active volcanic vents on Camiguin. Mount Vulcan, ironically known as the &quot;Old Volcano&quot; [], is actually the youngest volcano on the island, starting as a fissure vent in 1871 on the northwestern flank of Mount Hibok-Hibok [] (see Volcanic eruption below). As a parasitic cone of Hibok-Hibok, it is still considered part of the volcano. Some of the other flank domes of the volcano are Carling Hill, Tres Marias Hills and Piyakong Hill. Ilihan Crater is the site of the 1950 eruption.
* Mount Timpoong is the largest mountain on Camiguin. It is composed of several domes, the tallest of which is Timpoong Peak, also the highest on Camiguin at . The peak of Mambajao is the second tallest at . A lower central peak of is located between the two peaks. Some of the flank vents on Mount Timpoong are Campana Hill and Minokol Hill.
* Mount Butay, also known as &quot;Mount Uhay&quot;, is located between the towns of Mahinog and Guinsiliban.
* Mount Guinsiliban is located in the town of Guinsiliban. The mountain is the southernmost volcano and the first seen coming from the port of Balingoan on mainland Mindanao.

===Islands===
Located just a few kilometers off the coast are the two islands of Camiguin.
*White Island can be accessed from Agoho which is about west of the town of Mambajao.
*Mantigue Island can be reached from Mahinog about south of Mambajao.

===Springs===
*Ardent Hibok-Hibok Hot Spring — At the foot of Hibok-Hibok Volcano flow the mineral pools of Ardent Hot Springs. Wisps of steam can be seen rising from the running waters heated by the cauldron of the mountain, the most recently active of the seven volcanoes on the island.
*Santo Niño Cold Springs and Bura Natural Soda Water Swimming Pool in Catarman are other popular places to get a relaxing dip on the island.
*Tangub Hot Spring is an interesting hot spring located on the shore close to the Sunken Cemetery. Most of the spring is submerged and can be partly seen during low tide. The spring can also be examined by scuba diving or snorkeling, as visibility is excellent and it is also a recommended spot for observing underwater life.
===Sunken cemetery===
During the volcanic birth of Mt. Vulcan lasting from 1871 to about 1875, some areas in the town of Bonbon subsided, sinking the cemetery of the town to below sea level. The place is commemorated by a huge cross erected in 1982.

Since then the municipality of Bonbon has been transferred to the town of Catarman.

===Waterfalls===
*Katibawasan Falls — Located southeast of Mambajao, the Katibawasan Falls cascades down to a pool surrounded by orchids and ferns. An invigorating dip in the pool is popular, especially on warmer days, and there are also several hiking trails within the park. This is the favorite jump-off point for trekkers and mountaineers in search of adventure on the slopes of Mt. Timpoong.
*Tuasan Falls is located northeast of Catarman. Unfortunately, accessing the falls no longer entails a scenic hike passing through the Barrio of Mainit, Catarman and along the rocky river bed. The local government, to accommodate local tourism, decided in 2012 to improve access to the falls with a road built all the way up to the falls, which was finished in late 2014. Cars may be parked near the waterfalls, and from there it&#x27;s just a few minutes to reach the falls and the pool. The pool at the base of the waterfall is deep and clear. As of March 2015, the local government is finalizing construction of the &quot;Trans Island Highway&quot;, a road crossing Camiguin from Catarman to Mambajao which runs directly to the left of Tuasan Falls.

===Protected areas===
*Timpoong and Hibok-Hibok Natural Monument — Located in the central and western portions of Camiguin, the natural monument preserves an important watershed and center of biodiversity in the Mount Hibok-Hibok and Timpoong ranges. As the island&#x27;s only remaining forest, it supports the vast majority of the island&#x27;s endemic and endangered flora and fauna such as the Camiguin hanging parrot, Camiguin hawk-owl and Camiguin forest mouse.
*Giant Clam Sanctuary — Established by a non-government organization called Kabila Giant Clam Conservation and Ocean Nursery, this area is home to various species of corals and giant clams. Currently, 7 out of 9 species of giant clams can be found in the sanctuary.

==Biodiversity==

There are at least six vertebrate species are believed to be endemic to Camiguin.

===Amphibians===
Camiguin narrow-mouthed frog (&quot;Oreophryne nana&quot;).

===Mammals===
*&quot;Bullimus gamay&quot;, or the Camiguin forest rat
*&quot;Apomys camiguinensis&quot;, the Camiguin forest mouse

===Birds===
*&quot;Ninox leventisi&quot;, or the Camiguin hawk-owl
*&quot;Loriculus camiguinensis&quot;, the Camiguin hanging parrot
*&quot;Hypsipetes catarmanensis&quot;, or the Camiguin Bulbul

==Transportation==

* Cebu Pacific serves daily flights between Mactan Cebu International Airport and Camiguin Airport.
* Visitors may fly to mainland Mindanao via Laguindingan Airport in Cagayan de Oro in Misamis Oriental province, the gateway to Northern Mindanao. From the airport, a shuttle ride ferries visitors to any point in mainland Mindanao via Agora Bus Terminal in Cagayan de Oro. Eastbound buses take visitors to the port of Balingoan, Misamis Oriental in about two hours. The ferries to Benoni port take just over an hour (depending on weather conditions) and have more scheduled trips as it takes passengers closer to Mambajao. The time between trips varies during the day and runs from 4:00 am to 5:00 pm.
* A Super Shuttle Roro transports passengers daily between Camiguin&#x27;s Port of Balbagon and Bohol&#x27;s Port of Jagna.

==Natural calamities==

===Volcanic activity from 1871 to 1875===
On February 16, 1871, earthquakes began to be felt on the island, which increased in severity until April 30, when a volcanic fissure opened up southwest of the village of Catarman, northwest of Hibok-Hibok Volcano. &quot;Mt. Vulcan&quot; was born and continued erupting and pouring lava into the sea, at the same time gaining in height and width. In 1875, the &quot;Challenger expedition&quot; visited the area and described the mountain as a dome, in height, without any crater, but still smoking and incandescent at the top.

The old town of Catarman was destroyed and a portion of the town sank beneath the sea. The settlement moved to where the town center is presently located. All that remains today of &quot;Catarman Viejo&quot; are the ruins of the ancient Spanish church, a convent, and a bell tower.

===Eruptions from 1948 to 1951===
From 1948 to 1951, Mt. Hibok-Hibok was constantly rumbling and smoking. The first minor eruption in 1948 caused little damage and loss of life, but in 1949, a larger eruption caused 79 deaths due to pyroclastic flows. The largest eruption occurred in the morning of December 4, 1951. The volcano unleashed lava flows, poisonous gases, and pyroclastic flows destroying nearly 19 square kilometers of land, particularly in Mambajao. All in all, over 3,000 people were killed. Before the eruption of Mt. Hibok-Hibok in 1951, the population of Camiguin had reached 69,000. After the eruption, the population was reduced to about 34,000 due to massive out-migration. Most who left moved to the mainland Mindanao, mainly around Misamis Oriental.

===Typhoon of 2001===
A disastrous typhoon hit the province in the dawn of November 7, 2001. The tropical storm named &quot;Lingling&quot; (local name &quot;Nanang&quot;) brought &quot;buhawi&quot; (torrential downpours) on the mountains, causing multiple massive mudslides which killed about 200 inhabitants, most of whom were missing.

==Notable people==
* Maymay Entrata – actress, singer, big winner of &quot;Pinoy Big Brother: Lucky 7&quot; (born in Mambajao and raised in Cagayan de Oro)

<text>Trevor Ferguson, also known as John Farrow, (born 11 November 1947) is a Canadian novelist who lived for many years in Hudson, Quebec, and he and his wife Lynne Hill Ferguson now live in Victoria, BC. He is the author of fourteen novels and four plays. He has been called Canada&#x27;s best novelist both in &quot;Books in Canada&quot; and the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;.

Born in Seaforth, Huron County, Ontario in 1947, he was raised in Montreal from the age of three. In his mid-teens, he gravitated towards Canada&#x27;s northwest where he worked on railway gangs, and also began to write, working at night in the bunkhouses.

In his early twenties, he travelled and worked throughout Europe and the United States before returning to Montreal to write. He settled into driving a taxi by night and writing by day until the publication of his first novel, &quot;High Water Chants&quot;, in 1977, which Dennis Lee called one of the best in the language. His second novel, &quot;Onyx John&quot;, in 1985, received (arguably) the highest critical acclaim in the history of Canadian literature. Leon Rooke called it one of the five best novels of the twentieth century. Sixteen years later, the novel would become a bestseller in France. Indeed, his work is highly regarded in France, where he&#x27;s often cited as being one of the world&#x27;s pre-eminent writers.
Extraordinary praise also awaited the publication of his third novel, &quot;The Kinkajou&quot;. &quot;The Timekeeper&quot; won the Hugh MacLennan Prize for fiction and was developed into the 2009 film &quot;The Timekeeper&quot; by Louis Bélanger. A ninth novel, &quot;River City&quot;, was published in 2011 and the paperback, at 1,000 pages, in 2012. The option for it to be a mini-series has been agreed upon, as of November, 2013. Trevor Ferguson&#x27;s most recent literally novel was &quot;The River Burns&quot;, published by Simon and Schuster in 2014, the paperback in 2015. In November 2019, Ball Park under his nom de plume John Farrow was released, with a young Detective Emile Cinq-Mars set in Montreal 1975.

&quot;City of Ice&quot;, written under the penname John Farrow, has been published in 17 countries. The &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; called the book the best ever produced in Canada in genre fiction. The second in the series, &quot;Ice Lake&quot;, caused the New York library journal Booklist to claim that the series is among the very best in crime fiction today. &quot;Die Zeit&quot;, a major cultural newspaper in Germany, declared the series the best of all time. &quot;River City&quot; was the third of the three and was equally well received. A new trilogy of John Farrow crime novels, &quot;The Storm Murders&quot;, has been sold to Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin&#x27;s Press in New York and will appear under the Minotaur imprint. The first comes out in May, 2015, under the same name, &quot;The Storm Murders.&quot; The second. &quot;Seven Days Dead&quot; followed in 2016, to high praise in &quot;The New York Times,&quot; &quot;The Toronto Star&quot;, the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot;, and earned a starred review in &quot;Booklist.&quot; The third, &quot;Perish the Day,&quot; will come out in 2017. More crime novels are to follow the trilogy.

In 2002, Trevor Ferguson&#x27;s first play, &quot;Long, Long, Short, Long&quot; was produced by infinitheatre (dir. Guy Sprung) in Montreal and has become the first English play in history to be nominated by l&#x27;académie québécoise du theatre for a Masque award for best text. It returned to the stage in French in the fall of 2005, at Place des Arts in Montreal, and was seen by more than 20,000 people. His second play, &quot;Beach House, Burnt Sienna&quot;, was chosen to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Village Theatre West in Hudson in 2002. Co-produced with infinitheatre (dir. Guy Sprung), it enjoyed a highly successful run. A third play, &quot;Barnacle Wood&quot;, was produced in Montreal, also by infinitheatre, in March 2004. His fourth play, &quot;Zarathustra Said Some Things, No?&quot; opens with the Bridge Theatre Company at Studio 54 in New York City, in April, 2006. 
Ferguson is a past chair of the Writers&#x27; Union of Canada. He has been a writer-in-residence at the University of Alberta, an invité d&#x27;honneur at the Salon des Livres in Montreal, and he was among the Quebec authors invited as special guests of the Paris Book Fair in 1999, and to the Guadalajara Book Fair in 2003. In 2002, he was one of the few Canadian writers invited to the Festival of the Americas in Paris. Also in 2002, he served on the faculty of the May Writers&#x27; Studio at the Banff Centre for the Arts. He has frequently taught creative writing at Concordia University. In June 2019, Trevor Ferguson received an Honorary Doctorate, of Divinity, courtesy of the Vancouver School of Theology, for his work as a novelist.

<text>Bryon Anthony McCane II (born September 12, 1976), better known by his stage name Bizzy Bone, is an American rapper, singer and the youngest member of the Cleveland rap group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony.

== Early life ==
Bryon Anthony McCane II was born in Columbus, Ohio. In 1981, four-year-old McCane and his two sisters were abducted by their mother&#x27;s ex-husband while their mother was at work and held captive for over two years. McCane recalls that at first, he did not know he had been kidnapped and was made to believe that his mother and grandmother were dead. During the time they were abducted, he and his sisters lived in many homes, apartments, cars, and motels, all in northern Oklahoma. He and his sisters were often beaten, tortured, and sexually assaulted. In 1983, the &quot;family&quot; had been living on the Kaw Indian Reservation in Kaw, Oklahoma, for about a year and a half. A babysitter saw his photo at the end of the made-for-TV film &quot;Adam&quot; about the producer and creator of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, John Walsh&#x27;s son&#x27;s abduction, and called the police, resulting in his and his sisters&#x27; return to their family.

When he was 13, McCane began living with his oldest sister at her home near Cleveland, Ohio. During this period, he met Layzie Bone, Krayzie Bone, Wish Bone and Flesh-n-Bone. McCane started in hip-hop as a founding member of the group Bone Enterpri$e, which was formed in 1992. The group was noticed by one of the founders of the rap group N.W.A, Eazy-E, who modified the group&#x27;s name to Bone-Thugs-n-Harmony.

In 2002, McCane appeared on the FOX series &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; (hosted by John Walsh, Adam&#x27;s father) and he revealed his abusive childhood and molestation. McCane also wrote and performed a song, &quot;A.M.W.&quot;, on the show in which he thanks Walsh and encourages abused children to come forward.

<doc id="261075" wikidata="Q803210" url="?curid=261075" title="Settle–Carlisle line">
<text>The Settle–Carlisle line (also known as the &quot;Settle and Carlisle&quot; (S&amp;C)) is a main railway line in northern England. The route, which crosses the remote, scenic regions of the Yorkshire Dales and the North Pennines, runs between Settle Junction, on the Leeds–Morecambe line, and , near the English-Scottish borders. The historic line was constructed in the 1870s and has several notable tunnels and viaducts such as the imposing Ribblehead.

The line is managed by Network Rail. All passenger services are operated by Northern apart from temporary diverted services (due to closures of the West Coast Main Line) and are part of the National Rail network. Stations serve towns such as Settle in North Yorkshire, Appleby-in-Westmorland in Cumbria and small rural communities along its route.

In the 1980s, British Rail planned to close the Settle–Carlisle line. This prompted a campaign to save the line by rail groups, enthusiasts, local authorities and residents along the route. In 1989, the UK government announced the line would be saved from closure. Since then, passenger numbers have grown steadily to 1.2 million in 2012. Eight formerly closed stations have been reopened and several quarries have been reconnected to the line. It remains one of the most popular railway routes in the UK for charter trains and specials. After damage by a landslip, part of the line was closed from February 2016 to March 2017. To celebrate the reopening, the first regular mainline scheduled service in England for nearly half a century ran with a steam engine.

== History ==

===Background===
The Settle–Carlisle line (S&amp;C) had its origins in railway politics; the expansion-minded Midland Railway company was locked in dispute with the rival London and North Western Railway (LNWR) over access rights to the latter&#x27;s tracks to Scotland.

The Midland&#x27;s access to Scotland was via the &quot;Little North Western&quot; route to Ingleton. The Ingleton branch line from Ingleton to Low Gill, where it joined the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway, was under the control of the rival LNWR. Initially the routes, although physically connected at Ingleton, were not logically connected, as the LNWR and Midland could not agree on sharing the use of Ingleton station. Instead the LNWR terminated its trains at its own station at the end of Ingleton Viaduct, and Midland Railway passengers had to walk about a mile over steep gradients between the two stations in order to change into/from LNWR trains.

An agreement was reached over station access, enabling the Midland to attach through carriages to LNWR trains at Ingleton. Passengers could continue their journey north without leaving the train. The situation was not ideal, as the LNWR handled the through carriages of its rival with deliberate obstructiveness, for example attaching the coaches to slow goods trains instead of fast passenger workings.

The route through Ingleton is closed, but the major structures, Low Gill and Ingleton viaducts, remain. It was a well-engineered line suitable for express passenger running, but its potential was never realised due to the rivalry between the companies. The Midland board decided that the only solution was a separate route to Scotland. Surveying began in 1865, and in June 1866, Parliamentary approval was given to the Midland&#x27;s bill, for which Samuel Carter was solicitor. Soon afterwards, the Overend-Gurney banking failure sparked a financial crisis in the UK. Interest rates rose sharply, several railways went bankrupt and the Midland&#x27;s board, prompted by a shareholders&#x27; revolt, began to have second thoughts about a venture whose estimated cost was £2.3 million (equivalent to £ in ). As a result, in April 1869, with no work started, the company petitioned Parliament to abandon the scheme it had earlier fought for. However Parliament, under pressure from other railways which would benefit from the scheme that would cost them nothing, refused, and construction commenced in November that year.

=== Construction ===
The line was built by over 6,000 navvies, 

A plaque in St Leonard&#x27;s Church, Chapel-le-Dale, records the workers who died, both from disease and from accidents, while building the railway. The death toll is unknown, but 80 people died at Batty Green alone in a smallpox epidemic.

A memorial stone was laid in 1997 in the churchyard of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Mallerstang to commemorate the 25 railway builders and their families who died during the construction of this section of the line, and who were buried there in unmarked graves.

The engineer for the project was John Crossley from Leicestershire, a veteran of other Midland schemes. The terrain traversed is among the bleakest and wildest in England, and construction was halted for months at a time due to frozen ground, snowdrifts and flooding. One contractor had to give up as a result of underestimating the terrain and the weather – Dent Head has almost four times the rainfall of London. Another long-established partnership dissolved under the strain: that of William Eckersley and John Bayliss (1826-1900), Bayliss continued the project until its completion in 1877. They were contracted to construct the section from Kirkby Thore to Petteril Bridge in Carlisle.

The line was engineered to express standards throughout – local traffic was secondary, and many stations were miles from the villages they purported to serve. The railway&#x27;s summit at is at Aisgill, north of Garsdale. To keep the gradients to less than 1 in 100 (1%), a requirement for fast running using steam traction, huge engineering works were required. Even so, the terrain imposed a climb from Settle to Blea Moor, almost all of it at 1 in 100, and known to enginemen as &quot;the long drag&quot;.

The line required 14 tunnels and 22 viaducts; the most notable is the 24-arch Ribblehead Viaduct which is high and long. The swampy ground meant that the piers had to be sunk below the peat and set in concrete in order to provide a suitable foundation. Soon after crossing the viaduct, the line enters Blea Moor tunnel, long and below the moor, before emerging onto Dent Head Viaduct. The summit at Aisgill is the highest point reached by main-line trains in England. The tunnel at Lazonby was constructed at the request of a local vicar as he did not want the railway to run past the vicarage.

Water troughs were laid between the tracks at Garsdale, enabling steam engines to take water without losing speed.

The remains of the navvies&#x27; camp at Rise Hill Tunnel were investigated by Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Time Team&quot; in 2008, for a programme that was broadcast on 1 February 2009.

=== Operation ===
The line opened for goods traffic in August 1875 with the first passenger trains starting in April 1876. The cost of the line was £3.6 million (equivalent to £ in ) – 50 per cent above the estimate and a colossal sum for the time.

For some time the Midland dominated the market for London-Glasgow traffic, providing more daytime trains than its rival. In 1923 the Midland and the LNWR were both merged into the new London, Midland and Scottish Railway. In the new company, the disadvantages of the Midland&#x27;s route were clear – its steeper gradients and greater length meant it could not compete on speed from London to Glasgow, especially as Midland route trains had to make more stops to serve major cities in the Midlands and Yorkshire. The Midland had long competed on the extra comfort it provided for its passengers but this advantage was lost in the merged company.

After nationalisation in 1948, the pace of rundown quickened. It was regarded as a duplicate line, and control over the through London-Glasgow route was split over several regions which made it hard to plan popular through services. Mining subsidence affected speeds through the East Midlands and Yorkshire. In 1962, the Thames–Clyde Express travelling via the S&amp;C took almost nine hours from London to Glasgow – over the West Coast Main Line the journey length was 7 hours 20 minutes.

In 1963, the Beeching Report into the restructuring of British Rail recommended the withdrawal of all passenger services from the line. Some smaller stations had closed in the 1950s. Although the Beeching recommendations were shelved, it is clear that closure of the line was planned as early as the late 1960s. Such closure is referred to in paragraph 40 of the official report into the accident involving two goods trains between Horton-in-Ribblesdale and Selside on 30 October 1968, by Lt. Colonel I.K.A. McNaughton: &quot;... Even if the Settle and Carlisle line were planned to form part of the long term railway network of the country, it would still come fairly low in the priority list for installation of AWS; this route, however, is planned for closure within the next few years ...&quot; In May 1970 all stations except for Settle and Appleby West were closed, and its passenger service cut to two trains a day in each direction, leaving mostly freight.

Few express passenger services continued to operate, The Waverley from London St Pancras to Edinburgh Waverley via Nottingham ended in 1968, while the Thames–Clyde Express from London to Glasgow Central via Leicester, lasted until 1975. Night sleepers from London to Glasgow continued until 1976. After that a residual service from Glasgow – cut back at Nottingham (three trains each way) – survived until May 1982.

=== Threat of closure ===
During the 1970s, the S&amp;C suffered from a lack of investment, and most freight traffic was diverted onto the electrified West Coast Main Line. The condition of many viaducts and tunnels deteriorated due to lack of investment. DalesRail began operating services to closed stations on summer weekends in 1974. These were promoted by the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority to encourage ramblers.

In the early 1980s, the S&amp;C was carrying only a handful of trains per day, and British Rail decided the cost of renewing the viaducts and tunnels would be prohibitively expensive, given the small amount of traffic carried on the line. In June 1981 a protest group, the Friends of the Settle–Carlisle Line (FoSCL), held its inaugural meeting at Settle Town Hall and campaigned against the line&#x27;s closure even before it was officially announced.

In 1984, closure notices were posted at the S&amp;C&#x27;s remaining stations. However, local authorities and rail enthusiasts joined together and campaigned to save the S&amp;C, pointing out that British Rail was ignoring the S&amp;C&#x27;s potential for tourism, ignoring the need for a diversionary route to the West Coast main line, and failing to promote through traffic from the Midlands and Yorkshire to Scotland. 

There was outrage over the closure plan: critics pointed out that this was a main line, not a small branch railway. The campaign uncovered evidence that British Rail had mounted a dirty tricks campaign against the line, exaggerating the cost of repairs (£6 million for Ribblehead Viaduct alone) and diverting traffic away from the line in order to justify its closure plans, a process referred to as closure by stealth.

Publicity over British Rail&#x27;s tactics succeeded in a huge increase in traffic. Journeys per year were 93,000 in 1983 when the campaign began, rising to 450,000 by 1989. As late as August 1988, the British Rail Board posted notices stating they had appointed Lazard Brothers to &#x27;advise on the sale of the Settle–Carlisle line&#x27;. On 11 April 1989, the Secretary of State for Transport, Paul Channon, announced that consent for closure of the line and the associated Blackburn-Hellifield line would be refused. This was on the basis that, firstly, trial repairs to one span of the Ribblehead Viaduct had shown that it would be cheaper to repair the whole structure than had previously been anticipated and, secondly, the increased ridership of the line. British Rail estimated that revenue on the line was 40% higher than in 1988-89. Subsequently, British Rail started to repair the deteriorating tunnels and viaducts.

=== Statue of Ruswarp ===

In 2009, a statue of the border collie Ruswarp (pronounced Russup) was sited on the platform of the refurbished Garsdale railway station. The commemorative sculpture, funded by public subscription, was made by sculptor Joel Walker and cast in bronze. It celebrates the saving of the railway line which was coordinated by the Friends of the Settle to Carlisle Line, whose first secretary, Graham Nuttall, was a keen hillwalker; his dog Ruswarp signed the petition to save the line with his paw print. On 20 January 1990 Graham Nuttall had gone missing. He and Ruswarp had bought day return tickets from Burnley to Llandrindod Wells to go walking in the Welsh Mountains, but they never returned. Searches in the Elan Valley and Rhayader found nothing until on 7 April 1990, a lone walker found Nuttall&#x27;s body beside a stream. The 14-year-old Ruswarp was nearby, having stayed by his master&#x27;s body for 11 weeks in winter weather; he was so weak that he had to be carried down the mountain. His veterinary fees were paid by the RSPCA, who awarded him their Animal Medallion and collar for &#x27;vigilance&#x27; and Animal Plaque for &#x27;intelligence and courage&#x27;. He died shortly after Nuttall&#x27;s funeral.

== Current situation ==
Anglo-Scottish expresses have not been fully restored. The former regional franchisee Arriva Trains Northern initiated a twice daily Leeds–Glasgow Central service in 1999 (calling at Settle, Appleby, Carlisle, Lockerbie and Motherwell). The service was withdrawn at the behest of the Strategic Rail Authority in 2003, and there remains no link from Yorkshire or the East Midlands to Glasgow over the line. The link from Lancashire operates on Sundays during the summer months for the benefit of ramblers under the DalesRail brand. In recent years, due to congestion on the West Coast Main Line, much rail-freight traffic is using the S&amp;C once again. Gypsum is transported from Hull Docks and Drax Power Station to the British Gypsum plasterboard factory at Kirkby Thore, and coal was carried to power stations in Yorkshire and Fife from the Hunterston coal terminal until 2016. Major engineering work was needed to upgrade the line to the standards required for such heavy freight traffic and additional investment made to reduce the length of signal sections.

In July 2009, work to stabilise a length of embankment near Kirkby Thore and remove a long-standing permanent speed restriction was undertaken.

As of 2013, the line has experienced an upturn in fortunes. Eight formerly closed stations have reopened and in 2012 1.2 million passenger journeys were recorded compared with just 90,000 in 1983. Ribblehead station features a special visitor centre. The line is an important diversionary route from the electrified West Coast Main Line during engineering works. However, as the line is not electrified, electric trains such as &quot;Pendolinos&quot; need to be hauled by diesel locomotives (typically a Class 57 &quot;Thunderbird&quot;) along the diversion section.
In April 2014, the 25th anniversary of the line&#x27;s reprieve was celebrated by the running of a special train from Leeds to Carlisle over the route. This conveyed many of the campaigners who fought to save the line and called at Settle station, where a ceremony was held to commemorate the announcement made on 11 April 1989 that the line would be kept open. Michael Portillo, the Minister of State with responsibility for railways in the Thatcher government of the time (and who made the official announcement regarding the line in parliament) attended the celebrations.
From April 2016, Arriva Rail North Ltd took over all passenger services on the line from the previous operator which was run by Serco &amp; Abellio. As part of the new franchise agreement with the DfT, service improvements were implemented from the May 2018 timetable change with one extra weekday service each way and two extra trains each way on Sundays. Arriva also began work to install digital information screens and ticket machines at each station in early 2019. As from 1 March 2020, passenger services are now operated by the publicly run company Northern Trains, who have maintained this level of service.

In March 2020, it was discovered that the 144-year-old Ribblehead Viaduct required further major repairs. There were numerous defects to the masonry which had opened up, and pieces of debris had fallen off the edge. Alongside issues with the masonry there were fractures to the arches and piers, together with problems with the drainage system. Repair work was completed in April 2021 at a cost of around £2.1 million. 

The line was blocked once again in October 2022, when the rear half of a northbound Clitheroe to Carlisle Yard freight train derailed as it was leaving the line at Petteril Bridge Junction, on the outskirts of Carlisle on Wednesday 19 October. Five of the fourteen tank wagons in the consist left the rails, damaging the track, signalling equipment and river bridge. The stranded wagons (one of which toppled into the river) were recovered in mid-November using a heavy lift crane, after which the bridge was repaired/reinforced and new track, points and signal cables were installed to replace those damaged in the accident. The line reopened to traffic on schedule on 7 December 2022.

===Steam excursions and Diesel charter services===

Since the privatisation of British Rail. the Settle and Carlisle line has proved to be popular with charter train operating companies like West Coast Railways, which operate excursion trains using steam locomotives. Classes of LMS locomotive that have run over the line vary from express to mixed traffic, such as Black Fives, Jubilees, Coronations, Princess Royals and even goods engines like the 8Fs. Non-LMS engines that would never have worked on the line during the days of steam include 4468 &quot;Mallard&quot;, 5043 &quot;Earl of Mount Edgcumbe&quot;, 5972 &quot;Olton Hall&quot;, 35018 &quot;British India Line&quot;, 60103 &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot; and Britain&#x27;s newest mainline steam locomotive 60163 &quot;Tornado&quot;.

Between 19 July and 9 September 2021, Rail Charter Services operated The Staycation Express, with the service running between Skipton, Settle, Appleby and Carlisle. Running four times a day, every day except Friday, this fully refurbished HST 125, features five, all first class coaches and offers travellers an alternative method of enjoying the route. Statesman Rail also run occasional services with restored Class 47 diesels and Pullman coaches.

===Reconnection to quarries===
In July 2015 it was announced that the stone quarries at Arcow and Dry Rigg would be reconnected to the line via north facing points. Stone from both of these quarries is in demand for road building due to its high Polished Stone Value (PSV) and would be taken out of the Yorkshire Dales National Park by freight train instead of lorries. The work was undertaken during the last quarter of 2015 with the link opening to traffic in 2016. Plans are also in place to reconnect the neighbouring Horton Quarry, via relaid sidings immediately south of station, which were last used in the early 1980s.

===2015–17 temporary closures===
The winter of 2015–16 saw services over the route repeatedly disrupted by flooding and a serious landslip north of . Storm Desmond saw the line closed for several days at the beginning of December by flooding at several different locations, while the landslip at Eden Brows near Armathwaite resulted in the closure of the southbound line between Cumwhinton and from 29 January 2016 to allow the damaged embankment to be inspected and stabilised. Problems had first been reported in mid-December 2015, but repairs were carried out and services resumed on 22 December. Single-line working was in place for several days over the northbound line while the remedial work continued and an emergency timetable was in operation. Further ground movement at the site (due to the base of the embankment being eroded by the river and the saturated nature of the fill material originally used to construct the embankment) led to the complete closure of the line between Appleby &amp; Carlisle on 9 February 2016, with buses replacing trains over this section. Repairs to the affected section entailed building a 100m-long piled retaining wall and support platform for the track and stabilising the embankment beneath it; work began in July 2016 and was completed in March 2017. The line between Appleby and Armathwaite was reopened to traffic on 27 June 2016 on a temporary timetable; the repair project was estimated to cost £23 million. In February 2017, to celebrate the forthcoming reopening of the line on 31 March, scheduled trains drawn by 60163 &quot;Tornado&quot; ran in February, the first regular mainline scheduled service in England using steam for more than half a century. The service carried more than 5,500 passengers during its three days of operation.

In March 2017, work on the piled wall and trackbed at Eden Brows was completed and the work site was handed back to Network Rail, allowing the infrastructure operator to recommission and test the track and signalling system over the affected section ahead of the reopening date. On 31 March 2017 LNER Class A3 Pacific No. 60103 &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot; operated a special trip to Carlisle and back to celebrate the full opening to traffic.

===Rolling stock===
Passenger services are usually operated by Class 158 Diesel Multiple Units, although Class 156 units can also be used (on the seasonal DalesRail trains from Preston and Blackpool). Class 150 units have also begun to appear occasionally (as substitutes for the booked 158s) since a batch of the units were transferred to Northern Rail from London Midland in the autumn of 2011. Class 153 single-car units were also used on the line up until 2021, but are no longer in service with the operator.

==Simulators==
The line is featured in Microsoft Train Simulator, which depicts the line as it was in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, and in modern-day for Dovetail Games&#x27; Train Simulator.

Trainz Railway Simulator has a Settle &amp; Carlisle package modelled on the line under British Railways ownership in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

==In popular culture==
In 1983, Border Television released a film documentary named &#x27;Steam on the Settle &amp; Carlisle&#x27;. It featured a trip from Carlisle to Settle on the &quot;Cumbrian Mountain Express&quot; hauled by LNER A4 &quot;Sir Nigel Gresley&quot; (at the time in its LNER livery and number 4498). SR West Country class &quot;City of Wells&quot; and SR class LN &quot;Lord Nelson&quot; also made appearances towards the end, while LMS Princess Coronation Class 6229 &quot;Duchess of Hamilton&quot; (in un-streamlined form) was seen at the start and towards the end. In March 2016 a fifty-minute colour documentary &quot;The Long Drag&quot;, made in 1962-3 was released for free viewing on the British Film Institute website.

<text>The New Republic is an American magazine focused on domestic politics, news, culture, and the arts, with ten magazines a year and a daily online platform. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the magazine as partially founded in Teddy Roosevelt&#x27;s living room and known for its &quot;intellectual rigor and left-leaning political views.&quot;

== History ==
=== Early years: 1914 to 1974 ===
Founded in 1914 by several leaders of the progressive movement, it attempted to find a balance between &quot;a liberalism centered in humanitarian and moral passion and one based in an ethos of scientific analysis&quot;.

&quot;The New Republic&quot; was founded by Herbert Croly, Walter Lippmann, and Walter Weyl. They gained the financial backing of heiress Dorothy Payne Whitney and of her husband, Willard Straight (1880–1918) who eventually became the majority owner. The magazine&#x27;s first issue was published on November 7, 1914. The magazine&#x27;s politics were liberal and progressive, and as such concerned with coping with the great changes brought about by middle-class reform efforts designed to remedy perceived weaknesses in America&#x27;s changing economy and society. The magazine is widely considered important in changing the character of liberalism in the direction of governmental interventionism, both foreign and domestic. The most important of the perceived changes was the emergence of the U.S. as a great power on the international scene. In 1917, &quot;TNR&quot; urged America&#x27;s entry into the Great War on the side of the Allies.

Even before the U.S. entered the war, the Russian Revolution had started in March 1917. During the interwar years, the magazine was generally positive in its assessment of the Soviet Union (founded in 1922) and of Joseph Stalin. &quot;TNR&quot; changed its position after the Cold War began in 1947, and in 1948, its leftist editor, the former Vice President of the United States Henry A. Wallace, departed to run for president on the Progressive ticket. After Wallace, the magazine moved toward positions more typical of mainstream American liberalism. Throughout the 1950s, the publication was critical both of Soviet foreign policy and of domestic anticommunism, particularly McCarthyism. During the 1960s, the magazine opposed the Vietnam War but also often criticized the New Left.

Until the late 1960s, the magazine had a certain &quot;cachet as the voice of re-invigorated liberalism&quot;, in the opinion of the commentator Eric Alterman, who has criticized the magazine&#x27;s politics from the left. That cachet, Alterman wrote, &quot;was perhaps best illustrated when the dashing, young President Kennedy had been photographed boarding Air Force One holding a copy&quot;.

=== Peretz ownership and eventual editorship, 1974–1979 ===

In March 1974, the magazine was purchased for $380,000 by Martin Peretz, a lecturer at Harvard University, from Gilbert A. Harrison. Peretz was a veteran of the New Left but had broken with the movement over its support of various Third World liberationist movements, particularly the Palestine Liberation Organization. Harrison continued editing the magazine and expected Peretz to let him continue running the magazine for three years. However, by 1975, when Peretz became annoyed at having his own articles rejected for publication while he was pouring money into the magazine to cover its losses, he fired Harrison. Much of the staff, including Walter Pincus, Stanley Karnow, and Doris Grumbach, were fired or quit and were replaced largely by recent Harvard graduates, who lacked journalistic experience. Peretz became the editor and served in that post until 1979. In 1980, the magazine endorsed the moderate Republican John B. Anderson, who ran as an independent, rather than the Democratic incumbent Jimmy Carter. As other editors were appointed, Peretz remained editor-in-chief until 2012.

=== Kinsley and Hertzberg editorships, 1979–1991 ===

Michael Kinsley was editor (1979–1981, 1985–1989), alternating twice with the more leftleaning Hendrik Hertzberg (1981–1985; 1989–1991). Kinsley was only 28 years old when he first became editor and was still attending law school.

Writers for the magazine during this era included the neoliberals Mickey Kaus and Jacob Weisberg, along with Charles Krauthammer, Fred Barnes, Morton Kondracke, Sidney Blumenthal, Robert Kuttner, Ronald Steel, Michael Walzer, and Irving Howe.

In the 1980s, the magazine generally supported President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s anticommunist foreign policy, including his provision of aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. The magazine&#x27;s editors also supported both the Gulf War and the Iraq War and, reflecting its belief in the moral efficacy of American power, intervention in &quot;humanitarian&quot; crises, such as those in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo during the Yugoslav Wars.

It was widely considered a &quot;must read&quot; across the political spectrum. An article in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; judged it &quot;the smartest, most impudent weekly in the country&quot; and the &quot;most entertaining and intellectually agile magazine in the country.&quot; According to Alterman, the magazine&#x27;s prose could sparkle and the contrasting views in its pages were &quot;genuinely exciting.&quot; He added, &quot;The magazine unarguably set the terms of debate for insider political elites during the Reagan era.&quot;

The magazine won the respect of many conservative opinion leaders. Twenty copies were sent by messenger to the Reagan White House each Thursday afternoon. Norman Podhoretz called the magazine &quot;indispensable, &quot; and George Will called it &quot;currently the nation&#x27;s most interesting and most important political journal.&quot; &quot;National Review&quot; described it as &quot;one of the most interesting magazines in the United States.&quot;

Credit for its influence was often attributed to Kinsley, whose wit and critical sensibility were seen as enlivening, and Hertzberg, a writer for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and speechwriter for Jimmy Carter.

Hertzberg and Kinsley alternated as editor and as the author of the magazine&#x27;s lead column, &quot;TRB from Washington.&quot; Its perspective was described as center-left in 1988.

A final ingredient that led to the magazine&#x27;s increased stature in the 1980s was its &quot;back of the book&quot; or literary, cultural and arts pages, which were edited by Leon Wieseltier. Peretz discovered Wieseltier, then working at Harvard&#x27;s Society of Fellows, and installed him in charge of the section. Wieseltier reinvented the section along the lines of &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; and allowed his critics, many of them academics, to write longer, critical essays, instead of simple book reviews. Alterman calls the selection of Wieseltier &quot;probably... Peretz&#x27;s single most significant positive achievement&quot; in running the magazine. Despite changes of other editors, Wieseltier remained as cultural editor. Under him the section was &quot;simultaneously erudite and zestful,&quot; according to Alterman.&quot;

=== Sullivan editorship, 1991–1996 ===

In 1991, Andrew Sullivan became editor. He took the magazine in a somewhat more conservative direction, but the majority of writers remained liberal or neoliberal. Hertzberg soon left the magazine to return to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Kinsley left the magazine in 1996 to found the online magazine &quot;Slate&quot;.

In 1994, Sullivan invited Charles Murray to contribute a 10,000-word article, excerpted from his coauthored book &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;. The article, which contended that &quot;African Americans score differently from whites on standardized tests of cognitive ability,&quot; proved to be very controversial and was published in a special issue together with many responses and critiques. The magazine also published a very critical article by Elizabeth McCaughey about the Clinton administration&#x27;s health care plan. Alterman described the article as &quot;dishonest, misinformed,&quot; and &quot;the single most influential article published in the magazine during the entire Clinton presidency. James Fallows of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; noted the article&#x27;s inaccuracies and said, &quot;The White House issued a point-by-point rebuttal, which &quot;The New Republic&quot; did not run. Instead it published a long piece by McCaughey attacking the White House statement.&quot; Sullivan also published a number of pieces by Camille Paglia.

Ruth Shalit, a young writer for the magazine in the Sullivan years, was repeatedly criticized for plagiarism. After the Shalit scandals, the magazine began using fact-checkers during Sullivan&#x27;s time as editor. One was Stephen Glass. When later working as a reporter, he was later found to have made up quotes, anecdotes, and facts in his own articles.

=== Kelly, Lane, Beinart, Foer, Just editorships, 1996–2012 ===

After Sullivan stepped down in 1996, David Greenberg and Peter Beinart served jointly as acting editors. After the 1996 election, Michael Kelly served as editor for a year. During his tenure as editor and afterward, Kelly, who also wrote the TRB column, was intensely critical of Clinton.

Chuck Lane held the editor&#x27;s position between 1997 and 1999. During Lane&#x27;s tenure, the Stephen Glass scandal occurred. Glass, who had been a major contributing writer under Kelly&#x27;s editorship, was later shown to have falsified and fabricated numerous stories, which was admitted by &quot;The New Republic&quot; after an investigation by Kelly&#x27;s successor, Charles Lane. Kelly had consistently supported Glass during his tenure, including sending scathing letters to those challenging the veracity of Glass&#x27;s stories. (The events were later dramatized in the feature film &quot;Shattered Glass&quot;, adapted from a 1998 report by H.G. Bissinger.) Peretz has written that Lane ultimately &quot;put the ship back on its course,&quot; for which Peretz said he was &quot;immensely grateful.&quot; Lane resigned after he learned that Peretz intended to replace him.

Peter Beinart, a third editor who took over when he was 28 years old, followed Lane. He served as editor from 1999 to 2006.

In the early 2000s, the &quot;TNR&quot; added Buzz weblogs &quot;&amp;c.&quot;, &quot;Iraq&#x27;d&quot;, and &quot;Easterblogg&quot;, replaced in 2005 with the sole blog &quot;The Plank&quot;. &quot;The Stump&quot; was added in 2007 and covered the 2008 presidential election.

The magazine remained well known, with references to it occasionally popping up in popular culture. Lisa Simpson was once portrayed as a subscriber to &quot;The New Republic for Kids&quot;. Matt Groening, the creator of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&#x27;, once drew a cover for &quot;The New Republic&quot;. In the pilot episode of the HBO series &quot;Entourage,&quot; which first aired on July 18, 2004, Ari Gold asks Eric Murphy: &quot;Do you read &quot;The New Republic&quot;? Well, I do, and it says that you don&#x27;t know what the fuck you&#x27;re talking about.&quot;

Franklin Foer took over from Beinart in March 2006. The magazine&#x27;s first editorial under Foer said, &quot;We&#x27;ve become more liberal... We&#x27;ve been encouraging Democrats to dream big again on the environment and economics...&quot;
Other prominent writers who edited or wrote for the magazine in those years include senior editor and columnist Jonathan Chait, Lawrence F. Kaplan, John Judis and Spencer Ackerman.

=== Political stances under Peretz ===

&quot;The New Republic&quot; gradually became much less left-wing under Peretz, which culminated in the editorship of the conservative Andrew Sullivan. The magazine was associated with the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) and &quot;New Democrats&quot;, such as Bill Clinton and Joseph Lieberman, who received the magazine&#x27;s endorsement in the 2004 Democratic primary.

In the 21st century, the magazine gradually shifted left but was still more moderate and hawkish than conventional liberal periodicals. Policies supported by both &quot;The New Republic&quot; and the DLC in the 1990s were increased funding for the Earned Income Tax Credit program, the reform of the federal welfare system, and supply-side economics, especially the idea of reducing higher marginal income tax rates, which in the later Peretz years received heavy criticism from senior editor Jonathan Chait.

=== Foreign policy stances under Peretz ===

&quot;The New Republic&#x27;s&quot; support for Israel, including conservative right-wing or Likud stances of the state, was a strong theme of the magazine from the beginning: &quot;Support for Israel is deep down an expression of America&#x27;s best view of itself.&quot; According to the journalism professor Eric Alterman:

Nothing has been as consistent about the past 34 years of &quot;The New Republic&quot; as the magazine&#x27;s devotion to Peretz&#x27;s own understanding of what is good for Israel... It is really not too much to say that almost all of Peretz&#x27;s political beliefs are subordinate to his commitment to Israel&#x27;s best interests, and these interests as Peretz defines them almost always involve more war.

Unsigned editorials prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq expressed strong support for military action and cited the threat of facilities for weapons of mass destruction as well as humanitarian concerns. In the first years of the war, editorials were critical of the handling of the war but continued to justify the invasion on humanitarian grounds although they no longer maintained that Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction posed any threat to the United States. In the November 27, 2006 issue, the editors wrote:

At this point, it seems almost beside the point to say this: &quot;The New Republic&quot; deeply regrets its early support for this war. The past three years have complicated our idealism and reminded us of the limits of American power and our own wisdom.

=== Peretz sells remaining shares and buys magazine back from CanWest ===

Until February 2007, &quot;The New Republic&quot; was owned by Martin Peretz, New York financiers Roger Hertog and Michael Steinhardt, and Canadian media conglomerate Canwest.

In late February 2007, Peretz sold his share of the magazine to CanWest, which announced that a subsidiary, CanWest Media Works International, had acquired a full interest in the publication. Peretz retained his position as editor-in-chief.

In March 2009, Peretz and a group of investors, led by the former Lazard executive Laurence Grafstein and including Michael Alter, bought the magazine back from CanWest, which was on the edge of bankruptcy. Frank Foer continued as editor and was responsible for the day-to-day management of the magazine, and Peretz remained editor-in-chief.

=== New format ===

Starting with the March 19, 2007 issue, the magazine implemented major changes:

* &quot;Decreased frequency&quot;: the magazine went to publishing twice a month, or 24 times a year. This replaced the old plan of publishing 44 issues a year. The magazine described its publication schedule as &quot;biweekly,&quot; with specified &quot;skipped publication dates.&quot; There were ten of these in 2010.
* &quot;New design and layout&quot;: Issues featured more visuals, new art and other &quot;reader friendly&quot; content. Warnock typeface throughout was accented by woodcut-style illustrations.
* &quot;More pages and bigger size&quot;: Issues became bigger and contained more pages.
* &quot;Improved paper&quot;: Covers and pages became sturdier.
* &quot;Increased newsstand price&quot;: Although the subscription prices did not change, the newsstand price increased from $3.95 to $4.95.
* &quot;Website redesign&quot;: The website offered more daily content and new features. Richard Just took over as editor of the magazine on December 8, 2010.

=== Chris Hughes ownership and editorial crisis, 2012–2016 ===

On March 9, 2012, Chris Hughes, co-founder of Facebook, was introduced as the &quot;New Republic&quot;&#x27;s majority owner and Editor-in-Chief. Under Hughes, the magazine became less focused on &quot;The Beltway,&quot; with more cultural coverage and attention to visuals. It stopped running an editorial in every issue. Media observers noted a less uniformly pro-Israel tone in the magazine&#x27;s coverage than its editorial stance during Peretz&#x27;s ownership.n December 4, 2014, Gabriel Snyder, previously of Gawker and Bloomberg, replaced Franklin Foer as editor. The magazine was reduced from twenty issues per year to ten and the editorial offices moved from Penn Quarter, Washington DC, to New York, where it was reinvented as a &quot;vertically integrated digital-media company.&quot; The changes provoked a major crisis among the publication&#x27;s editorial staff and contributing editors. The magazine&#x27;s literary editor, Leon Wieseltier, resigned in protest. Subsequent days brought many more resignations, including those of executive editors Rachel Morris and Greg Veis; nine of the magazine&#x27;s eleven active senior writers; legal-affairs editor Jeffrey Rosen; the digital-media editor; six culture writers and editors; and thirty-six out of thirty-eight contributing editors (including Paul Berman, Jonathan Chait, William Deresiewicz, Ruth Franklin, Anthony Grafton, Enrique Krauze, Ryan Lizza, Sacha Z. Scoblic, Helen Vendler, Sean Wilentz). In all, two-thirds of the names on the editorial masthead were gone.

The mass resignations forced the magazine to suspend its December 2014 edition. Previously a weekly for most of its history, it was immediately before suspension published ten times per year with a circulation of approximately 50,000. The company went back to publishing twenty issues a year, and editor Gabriel Snyder worked with staff to reshape it.

In the wake of the editorial crisis, Hughes indicated that he intended to stay with &quot;The New Republic&quot; over the long term, telling an NPR interviewer of his desire to make sure the magazine could produce quality journalism &quot;hopefully for decades to come.&quot; He published an open letter about his &quot;commitment&quot; to give the magazine &quot;a new mandate for a new century.&quot; However, on January 11, 2016, Hughes put &quot;The New Republic&quot; up for sale. In another open letter, he said, &quot;After investing a great deal of time, energy, and over $20 million, I have come to the conclusion that it is time for new leadership and vision at The New Republic.&quot;

=== Win McCormack ownership, 2016–present ===

In February 2016, Win McCormack bought the magazine from Hughes, and named Eric Bates, the former executive editor of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, as editor. In September 2017, Bates was demoted from his leadership role to a masthead title of &quot;editor at large.&quot; J.J. Gould, coming from &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, then served as editor for just over a year, before resigning in December 2018. In November 2017, Hamilton Fish V, the publisher since McCormack&#x27;s acquisition of the magazine, resigned amid allegations of workplace misconduct. Kerrie Gillis was named publisher in February 2019, and Chris Lehmann, formerly the editor in chief of &quot;The Baffler&quot;, was named editor April 9, 2019. Within months his management style faced public criticism for his hiring process of an Inequality Editor, posted on June 28. Within weeks, another scandal erupted, with Lehmann facing even harsher criticism from the public and the media for his decision to publish a controversial op-ed by Dale Peck called &quot;My Mayor Pete Problem.&quot; The op-ed was retracted, with Lehmann commenting in a separate statement: &quot;The New Republic recognizes that this post crossed a line, and while it was largely intended as satire, it was inappropriate and invasive.&quot; In March 2021, it was announced that Lehmann would be departing his role as editor and would be replaced by Michael Tomasky.

== Circulation ==

=== Print circulation in the 2000s ===

&quot;The New Republic&quot;″s average paid circulation for 2009 was 53,485 copies per issue.

&quot;The New Republic&quot;″s last reported circulation numbers to media auditor BPA Worldwide were for the six months ending on June 30, 2009.

=== Online ===

According to Quantcast, the &quot;TNR&quot; website received roughly 120,000 visitors in April 2008, and 962,000 visitors in April 2012. By June 9, 2012, the &quot;TNR&quot; website&#x27;s monthly page visits dropped to 421,000 in the U.S. and 521,000 globally. As of April 16, 2014, the &quot;TNR&quot; website&#x27;s Quantcast webpage contains the following messages: &quot;This publisher has not implemented Quantcast Measurement. Data is estimated and not verified by Quantcast...,&quot; and &quot;We do not have enough information to provide a traffic estimate...,&quot; and &quot;Traffic data unavailable until this site becomes quantified.&quot; Demographically, data show that visitors tend to be well educated (76% being college graduates, with 33% having a graduate degree), relatively affluent (55% having a household income of over $60,000 and 31% having a six figure income), white (83%), and more likely to be male (61%). Eighty two percent were at least 35 years old with 38% being over the age of 50.

== Controversies ==

=== Michael Straight ===

&quot;New Republic&quot; editor Michael Whitney Straight (1948 to 1956) was later discovered to be a spy for the KGB, recruited into the same network as Donald Maclean, Guy Burgess, Kim Philby, and Anthony Blunt. Straight&#x27;s espionage activities began at Cambridge during the 1930s; he later claimed that they ceased during World War II. Later, shortly before serving in the Kennedy administration, he revealed his past ties and turned in fellow spy Anthony Blunt. In return for his cooperation, his own involvement was kept secret and he continued to serve in various capacities for the US Government until he retired. Straight admitted his involvement in his memoirs; however, subsequent documents obtained from the former KGB after the fall of the Soviet Union indicated that he drastically understated the extent of his espionage activities.

=== Ruth Shalit plagiarism ===

In 1995, writer Ruth Shalit was fired for repeated incidents of plagiarism and an excess of factual errors in her articles.

=== Stephen Glass scandal ===

In 1998, features writer Stephen Glass was revealed in a &quot;Forbes Digital&quot; investigation to have fabricated a story called &quot;Hack Heaven&quot;. A &quot;TNR&quot; investigation found that most of Glass&#x27;s stories had used or been based on fabricated information. The story of Glass&#x27;s fall and &quot;TNR&quot; editor Chuck Lane&#x27;s handling of the scandal was dramatized in the 2003 film &quot;Shattered Glass&quot;, based on a 1998 article in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;.

=== Lee Siegel ===

In 2006, long-time contributor, critic, and senior editor Lee Siegel, who had maintained a blog on the &quot;TNR&quot; site dedicated primarily to art and culture, was revealed by an investigation to have collaborated in posting comments to his own blog under an alias aggressively praising Siegel, attacking his critics and claiming not to be Lee Siegel when challenged by an anonymous detractor on his blog. The blog was removed from the website and Siegel was suspended from writing for the print magazine. He resumed writing for &quot;TNR&quot; in April 2007. Siegel was also controversial for his coinage &quot;blogofascists&quot; which he applied to &quot;the entire political blogosphere&quot;, though with an emphasis on leftwing or center-left bloggers such as Daily Kos and Atrios.

=== Spencer Ackerman ===

In 2006, associate editor Spencer Ackerman was fired by editor Franklin Foer. Describing it as a &quot;painful&quot; decision, Foer attributed the firing to Ackerman&#x27;s &quot;insubordination&quot;: disparaging the magazine on his personal blog, saying that he would &quot;skullfuck&quot; a terrorist&#x27;s corpse at an editorial meeting if that was required to &quot;establish his anti-terrorist &quot;bona fides&quot; and sending Foer an e-mail where he said—in what according to Ackerman was intended to be a joke—he would &quot;make a niche in your skull&quot; with a baseball bat. Ackerman, by contrast, argued that the dismissal was due to &quot;irreconcilable ideological differences.&quot; He believed that his leftward drift as a result of the Iraq War and the actions of the Bush administration was not appreciated by the senior editorial staff. Within 24 hours of being fired by &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Ackerman was hired as a senior correspondent for a rival magazine, &quot;The American Prospect&quot;.

=== Scott Thomas Beauchamp controversy ===
In July 2007, after &quot;The New Republic&quot; published an article by an American soldier in Iraq titled &quot;Shock Troops&quot;, allegations of inadequate fact-checking were leveled against the magazine. Critics alleged that the piece contained inconsistent details indicative of fabrication. The identity of the anonymous soldier, Scott Thomas Beauchamp, was revealed. Beauchamp was married to Elspeth Reeve, one of the magazine&#x27;s three fact-checkers. As a result of the controversy, &quot;The New Republic&quot; and the United States Army launched investigations, reaching different conclusions. In an article titled &quot;The Fog of War&quot;, published on December 1, 2007, Franklin Foer wrote that the magazine could no longer stand behind the stories written by Beauchamp.

=== Pete Buttigieg article ===

On July 12, 2019, gay writer Dale Peck wrote an article for &quot;The New Republic&quot; critical of Pete Buttigieg, a 2020 Democratic Party presidential primary candidate, in which he repeatedly referred to Buttigieg as &quot;Mary Pete&quot;, which he described as the &quot;gay equivalent of Uncle Tom&quot;, saying, &quot;Pete and I are just not the same kind of gay.&quot; The article went on to describe the candidate as a &quot;fifteen-year-old boy in a Chicago bus station wondering if it&#x27;s a good idea to go home with a fifty-year-old man so that he&#x27;ll finally understand what he is.&quot; The piece was harshly received by some media figures and was the center of controversy.

== Editors ==

Before Wallace&#x27;s appointment in 1946, the masthead listed no single editor in charge but gave an editorial board of four to eight members. Walter Lippmann, Edmund Wilson, and Robert Morss Lovett, among others, served on this board at various times.

<text>Roger Bigod (c. 1245 – bf. 6 December 1306) was 5th Earl of Norfolk.
 
==Origins==
He was the son of Hugh Bigod (1211–1266), Justiciar, and succeeded his father&#x27;s elder brother Roger Bigod, 4th Earl of Norfolk (1209–1270) as 5th Earl of Norfolk in 1270.

==Career==
Bigod is the hero of an altercation with King Edward I in 1297, which arose from the king&#x27;s command that Bigod should serve against the King of France in Gascony, while Edward himself went to Flanders. Bigod asserted that by the feudal tenure of his lands he was only compelled to serve across the seas &quot;in the company of the king himself&quot;, whereupon Edward said, &quot;By God, Earl, you shall either go or hang,&quot; to which Bigod replied, &quot;By the same oath, O king, I will neither go nor hang.&quot;

Bigod gained his point, and after Edward had left for France, together with Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford, Bigod prevented the collection of an aid for the war and forced Edward to confirm the charters in this year of 1297 and again in 1301. The historian William Stubbs reckoned Bigod and Bohun as &quot;but degenerate sons of mighty fathers; greater in their opportunities than in their patriotism.&quot;

Bigod had done good service for the King in the past. In August 1282, for instance, contemporary accounts record Bigod &quot;going to Wales on the king&#x27;s service.&quot; During his absence in Ireland, Bigod had sent letters nominating Reginald Lyvet and William Cadel to act as his attorneys in England for the year. Reginald Lyvet was probably the son of Gilbert de Lyvet, who was Lord Mayor of Dublin for several terms in the early thirteenth century, and was a partisan of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke. Some scholars have wondered how English barons like Bigod and the Clares kept such a tight hold on their Irish lands during a time when the English grip on Ireland was starting to weaken. Apparently part of the secret was the delegation of authority, as in this case by Bigod to his lieutenants Lyvet and Cadel.

==Marriages==
Bigod married firstly Aline Basset, widow of Hugh le Despencer, 1st Baron le Despencer (d. 1265), and daughter and heiress of Sir Philip Basset of Soham, Cambridgeshire, by his first wife Hawise de Lovaine, daughter of Sir Matthew de Lovaine, by whom he had no issue.

He married secondly Alice of Hainault, daughter of John II de Avenes, Count of Hainault, by Philippine, daughter of Henry, Count of Luxembourg and Roche, Marquis of Arlon, by whom he had no issue.

==Death==
Bigod died on 6 December 1306.

==Succession==
In 1302 the elderly and childless Bigod surrendered his earldom to the king and received it back entailed &quot;to the heirs of his body&quot;. This had the effect of disinheriting his brother John. Thus, when Roger died without issue in December 1306, his title became extinct, and his estates escheated to the crown and were eventually bestowed on Thomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk.

<text>La Ferté-Alais () is a commune in the Essonne department in Île-de-France in northern France. It is south of Paris. It used to be a fortress closing the access to the French royal estate from the Essonne valley, then became an industrial village with sand and stones. Its airfield (actually in Cerny), hosts a world-famous air show for vintage World War I and WWII aircraft and a museum of such aircraft.

It even has the aircraft (still airworthy) that Louis Blériot used to cross the English Channel in 1909.

==Town name history==
The town was known under the name Firmitas, Firmitas Aalipdis, Firmitas Adelaidis, Ferte in 1091, Firmitas Balduini, la Ferté Baudouin in the 12th century from the name of its lord in the 11th century, Feritas, Firmitas Aidelaidis around 1200, apud Feritatem Alisie in 1266, la Ferté Aales around 1263. The name La Ferte-Aleps appears in the Cassini maps and the final name of the commune is registered during its creation in 1793. It is possible to find the name La Ferté-Alaix and afterwards La Ferté-Alais in the law bulletin in 1801. But the final name will remain from 1845 onwards.

==Population==

Inhabitants of La Ferté-Alais are known as &quot;Fertois&quot; in French.

<text>Roger Bigod (c. 1209–1270) was 4th Earl of Norfolk and Marshal of England.

==Origins==
He was the eldest son and heir of Hugh Bigod, 3rd Earl of Norfolk (1182-1225) by his wife Maud, a daughter of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1147-1219), Marshal of England. His younger brother was Hugh Bigod (1211-1266), Justiciar. After the death of his father in 1225, the young Roger became the ward of William Longespée, 3rd Earl of Salisbury.

==Career==
In 1228, although still under-age but by now married and in a second wardship to Alexander II of Scotland following his 1225 marriage to Alexander&#x27;s sister Isabella, he succeeded to his father&#x27;s estates including Framlingham Castle after his unexpected death in 1225. However, the earldom was only granted to him by Henry III in 1233.

Roger was already a wealthy magnate, but in 1248 he received vast lands in south Wales and Ireland on the death of his mother. Through his mother, Roger had gained the hereditary title of Marshal of England, one of the most influential royal offices of medieval England, in 1246. 

Responsible for keeping order around the king, in peacetime the marshal performed a ceremonial and judicial role, with lucrative rights, such as securing gifts from newly created knights. During wartime, the marshal was responsible for the discipline of the army.

Roger attended Henry III&#x27;s Court and even hosted the king at Framlingham, but tensions arose over the repayment of debts to the king, as well as growing criticism of the royal government. 

In 1255, the chronicler Matthew Paris reported an exchange between the two men. When Henry called Roger a traitor, the earl replied, &quot;You lie. I have never been a traitor, nor shall I ever be. If you are just, how can you harm me.&quot; &quot;I can seize your corn and thresh it, and sell it,&quot; retorted the king. &quot;Do so,&quot; said Roger, &quot;and I will send back your threshers without their heads.&quot; 

In 1258, Roger was at the head of a rebel group of barons and knights who marched on Westminster Hall, compelling the king to accept major constitutional reforms, known as the Provisions of Oxford. Despite having other property around the country, Roger always retained his strong East Anglian loyalties. He died in 1270 and was buried, like his forefathers, at Thetford Priory.

==Marriage==
His first warder married him to Isabella of Scotland, daughter of William the Lion, King of Scotland, whereupon still under-age, he became a ward of his new brother-in-law, Alexander II of Scotland until 1228.

==Succession==
Roger had no children, and was succeeded by his nephew Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk (1245-1306).

<text>Roger Bigod ( – 1221) was the son of Hugh Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk and his first wife, Juliana de Vere. Although his father died in 1176 or 1177, Roger did not succeed to the earldom of Norfolk until 1189 for his claim had been disputed by his stepmother for her sons by Earl Hugh in the reign of Henry II. King Richard I confirmed him in his earldom and other honours, and also sent him as an ambassador to France in the same year. Roger inherited his father&#x27;s office as royal steward. He took part in the negotiations for the release of Richard from prison, and after the king&#x27;s return to England became a justiciar.

During the Revolt of 1173–74, Roger remained loyal to the king while his father sided with the king&#x27;s rebellious sons. Roger fought at the Battle of Fornham on 17 October 1173, where the royalist force defeated a rebel force led by Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester.

In most of the years of the reign of King John, the earl was frequently with the king or on royal business. Yet Roger was to be one of the leaders of the baronial party which obtained John&#x27;s assent to Magna Carta, and his name and that of his son and heir Hugh II appear among the twenty-five barons who were to ensure the king&#x27;s adherence to the terms of that document. The pair were excommunicated by the pope in December 1215, and in 1216 John marched to East Anglia with a force of mercenaries and laid siege to Roger&#x27;s seat of Framlingham Castle. Bigod was away, but Framlingham&#x27;s garrison has 26 knights, 20 sergeants-at-arms, 7 crossbowmen, 1 chaplain and 3 others, perhaps enough to hold out until Roger returned to command support. Yet the castle surrendered two days, most likely for political expediency. The loss of the castle was temporary (Bigod made peace with the regents of John&#x27;s son Henry III in 1217) but Roger seems to have retired from public life after this time. He died in 1221, his lands intact, the Bigod powerhouse secured and himself a respected figure.

Around Christmas 1181, Roger married Ida, apparently Ida de Tosny (or Ida de Toesny), and by her had a number of children including:
#Hugh Bigod, 3rd Earl of Norfolk who married in 1206/1207, Maud, a daughter of William Marshal
#William Bigod
#Ralph Bigod
#Roger Bigod
#Margery, married William de Hastings
#Mary Bigod, married Ralph fitz Robert

Many historians, including Marc Morris, have speculated that the couple had a third daughter, Alice, who married Aubrey de Vere IV, Earl of Oxford as his second wife. If so, the marriage would have been well within the bounds of consanguinity, for the couple would have been quite closely related, a daughter of the second earl of Norfolk being first cousin once removed to the second earl of Oxford.

==Roger Bigod in fiction==
Roger Bigod and his wife Ida De Tosny are the main characters in Elizabeth Chadwick&#x27;s &quot;The Time of Singing&quot; (Sphere, 2008), published in the USA as &quot;For the King&#x27;s Favor&quot;. They appear as minor characters in other of her books set at the same time, notably &quot;To Defy a King&quot;, which concerns the marriage of their son Hugh to Maud, a daughter of William Marshal. As Bigot, Bigod also appears as a character in the play &quot;King John&quot; by William Shakespeare.

<text>Stanley Howse, better known as Flesh-n-Bone (born June 10, 1973), is an American rapper known as a member of the hip hop group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. He is the older brother of Layzie Bone and cousin of Wish Bone.

== Legal troubles ==
In December 1999, Flesh-n-Bone was involved in a dispute with one-time friend Tarrance Vickers. During the dispute, Flesh-n-Bone pulled out a loaded semiautomatic AK-47 rifle and took aim at Vickers. The presiding Van Nuys Superior Court Judge deemed Howse&#x27;s life story &quot;one of the worst cases of child abuse she had ever read, full of beatings and other physical, emotional, and mental traumas.&quot; Flesh-n-Bone apologized and took responsibility for his actions and pleaded guilty. On September 22, 2000, Howse was sent to Pleasant Valley State Prison for 12 years on charges of assault with a deadly weapon and violation of probation. He was also required to undertake an anger-management course.

Flesh-n-Bone was picked up on gun possession charges on Thursday, April 2, 2009, in Santa Clarita, CA, according to TMZ. He was held without bail. However, the gun possession charges against him were dropped on April 20, 2009 in a Santa Clarita courthouse. &quot;The defense turned over some information, and we investigated and realized we were unable to proceed with the charges as filed, so the judge dismissed the case,&quot; said Jane Robinson, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles district attorneys office.

On March 28, 2010, during the Bone Thugs-n-Harmony reunion tour, Flesh-n-Bone was picked up on a 10-year-old felony warrant in Cleveland, Ohio during a show at the House Of Blues. He was released from custody five days later and charges were dismissed.

<text>In the Battle of &quot;Ager Sanguinis&quot;, also known as the Battle of the Field of Blood, the Battle of Sarmada, or the Battle of Balat, Roger of Salerno&#x27;s Crusader army of the Principality of Antioch was annihilated by the army of Ilghazi of Mardin, the Artuqid ruler of Aleppo on 28 June 1119.

==Background==
Antioch and the other Crusader States were constantly at war with the Muslim states of Northern Syria and the Jazeerah, principally Aleppo and Mosul. When Ridwan of Aleppo died in 1113, there was a period of peace, at least for a few years. However, Roger of Salerno, who was ruling Antioch as regent for Bohemond II, did not take advantage of Ridwan&#x27;s death; likewise, Baldwin II, count of Edessa, and Pons, count of Tripoli, looked after their own interests and did not ally with Roger against Aleppo. In 1115, Roger defeated a Seljuk Turkish invasion force led by Bursuq ibn Bursuq at the Battle of Sarmin.

In 1117, Aleppo came under the rule of the Artuqid atabeg Ilghazi. In 1118, Roger captured Azaz, which left Aleppo open to attack from the Crusaders; in response, Ilghazi invaded the Principality in 1119. Roger marched out from Artah with Bernard of Valence, the Latin Patriarch of Antioch. Bernard suggested they remain there, as Artah was a well-defended fortress only a short distance away from Antioch, and Ilghazi would not be able to pass if they were stationed there. The Patriarch also advised Roger to call for help from Baldwin, now king of Jerusalem, and Pons, but Roger felt he could not wait for them to arrive.

Roger camped in the pass of Sarmada, while Ilghazi besieged the fort of al-Atharib. A force under Robert of Vieux-Pont set out to break the siege, and Ilghazi feigned a retreat, Robert&#x27;s men were drawn out from the fort and ambushed.

==Battle==
Ilghazi was also waiting for reinforcements from Toghtekin, the Burid emir of Damascus, but he too was tired of waiting. Using little-used paths, his army quickly surrounded Roger&#x27;s camp during the night of 27 June. The prince had recklessly chosen a campsite in a wooded valley with steep sides and few avenues of escape. Roger&#x27;s army of 700 knights, 500 Armenian cavalry and 3,000 foot soldiers, including turcopoles, hastily formed into five divisions. These drew up in a V-shaped line with the tip farthest from the Muslim battle array. From left to right, the divisions were commanded by Robert of St. Lo, Prince Roger, Guy de Frenelle, Geoffrey the Monk and Peter. Meanwhile, Roger held back a sixth division under Renaud Mansoer to protect the Antiochene rear.

As the Muslim army waited, the &quot;qadi&quot; Abu al-Fadl ibn al-Khashshab, wearing his lawyer&#x27;s turban but brandishing a lance, rode out in front of the troopers. At first they were incredulous at being harangued by a scholar but at the end of his passionate evocation of the duties and merits of the jihad warrior, according to Kamal ad-Din, the contemporary historian of Aleppo, these hardened professionals wept with emotion and rode into battle.

That morning, 28 June, the battle was begun by an archery duel between the Antiochene infantry, posted in front of the knights, and the Turkish bowmen. The crusader army was at first successful when the right-hand divisions of Peter and Geoffrey the Monk attacked and defeated the Artuqids opposed to them. Guy de Frenelle&#x27;s center division had some success also, but the battle was soon decided on the left flank. Robert of St. Lo and the Turcopoles were driven back into Roger&#x27;s division, disrupting it. A north wind blew dust in the faces of the Antioch knights and footmen, confusing them further. Soon, Artuqid flanking forces enveloped the crusaders.

During the fighting, Roger was killed by a sword in the face at the foot of the great jewelled cross which had served as his standard. The rest of the army was killed or captured; only two knights survived. Renaud Mansoer took refuge in the fort of Sarmada to wait for King Baldwin, but was later taken captive by Ilghazi. Among the other prisoners was likely Walter the Chancellor, who later wrote an account of the battle. The massacre led to the name of the battle, &quot;ager sanguinis&quot;, Latin for &quot;the field of blood.&quot;

==Name &quot;ager sanguinis&quot;==
The description &quot;ager sanguinis&quot; is possibly a Biblical reference to the field purchased by Judas with the money he had been given to betray Jesus. The Acts of the Apostles records that Judas killed himself in the field, and it was thus known as &quot;acheldemach&quot; in Aramaic, and &quot;ager sanguinis&quot; in the Vulgate.

==Casualties==
The Muslims captured 70 knights and 500 soldiers of inferior rank. The high-ranking prisoners were ransomed and 30 men who could not pay their way out were executed.

==Aftermath==
Ilghazi soon went on an alcoholic binge and did not advance to Antioch, where Patriarch Bernard was organizing whatever defense he could. Even so, because of the loss of the Antiochene field army, Atharib, Zerdana, Sarmin, Ma&#x27;arrat al-Numan and Kafr Tab rapidly fell into Muslim hands.

Ilghazi was defeated by Baldwin II of Jerusalem and Count Pons at the Battle of Hab on 14 August and Baldwin took over the regency of Antioch. Subsequently, Baldwin recovered some of the lost towns. Even so, the defeat at the Field of Blood left Antioch severely weakened, and subject to repeated attacks by the Muslims in the following decade. Eventually, the Principality came under the influence of a resurgent Byzantine Empire.

The Crusaders regained some of their influence in Syria at the Battle of Azaz six years later in 1125.

<doc id="261087" wikidata="Q104000" url="?curid=261087" title="Lauren Bacall">
<text>Betty Joan Perske (September 16, 1924 – August 12, 2014), professionally known as Lauren Bacall ( ), was an American actress. She was named the 20th-greatest female star of classic Hollywood cinema by the American Film Institute. She received an Academy Honorary Award in 2009 in recognition of her contribution to the Golden Age of motion pictures. Bacall was one of the last surviving major stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood cinema.

Bacall began a career as a model for the Walter Thornton Model Agency before making her film debut at the age of twenty in &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; (1944) as the leading lady opposite Humphrey Bogart, whom she later married. She continued in the film noir genre with appearances alongside Bogart in &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1946), &quot;Dark Passage&quot; (1947), and &quot;Key Largo&quot; (1948), and she starred in the romantic comedies &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot; (1953) and &quot;Designing Woman&quot; (1957). She portrayed the female lead in &quot;Written on the Wind&quot; (1956), which is considered one of Douglas Sirk&#x27;s seminal films. She later acted in &quot;Harper&quot; (1966), &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1974), and &quot;The Shootist&quot; (1976).

Bacall found a career resurgence for her role in the romantic comedy &quot;The Mirror Has Two Faces&quot; (1996), for which she earned the Golden Globe Award and the Screen Actors Guild Award, in addition to nominations for the Academy Award and the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress. During the final stage of her career, she gained newfound success with a younger audience for major supporting roles in the films &quot;Misery&quot; (1990), &quot;Dogville&quot; (2003), &quot;Birth&quot; (2004), and the English dubs of the animated films &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot; (2004) and &quot;Ernest &amp; Celestine&quot; (2012).

For her work in theatre, Bacall made her Broadway debut in &quot;Johnny 2x4&quot; (1942). She went on to win two Tony Awards for Best Actress in a Musical for her performances in &quot;Applause&quot; (1970) and &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; (1981). She also acted in the play &quot;Goodbye Charlie&quot; (1959), the farce &quot;Cactus Flower&quot; (1965), and &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; (1977). She made her West End debut in &quot;The Applause&quot; (1970) followed by &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; (1985).

==Early life and education ==
Lauren Bacall was born Betty Joan Perske on September 16, 1924, in the Bronx, New York City, the only child of Natalie (&quot;née&quot; Weinstein-Bacal; 1901–1969), a secretary who later legally changed her surname to Bacal, and William Perske (1889–1982), who worked in sales. Both of her parents were Jewish. Her mother emigrated from Iași, Romania, through Ellis Island. Her father was born in New Jersey to parents who were born in Valozhyn, at that time a predominantly Jewish community in present-day Belarus.

Bacall&#x27;s parents divorced when she was five, after which she no longer saw her father. She later took the Romanian form of her mother&#x27;s last name, Bacall. She was close to her mother, who remarried Lee Goldberg and moved to California after Bacall became a star. Through her father, Bacall was related to Shimon Peres (born Szymon Perski), the eighth prime minister and ninth president of Israel. Peres did not know about the relationship until Bacall told him.

Bacall&#x27;s family moved soon after her birth to Brooklyn&#x27;s Ocean Parkway. Money from a wealthy family allowed Bacall to attend school at the Highland Manor Boarding School for Girls in Tarrytown, New York, a private boarding school founded by philanthropist Eugene Heitler Lehman, and Julia Richman High School in Manhattan.

==Early career and modeling==

In 1941, Bacall took lessons at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York, where she dated classmate Kirk Douglas. She worked as a theatre usher at the St. James Theatre and as a fashion model in department stores.

She made her acting debut on Broadway in 1942 at age 17 as a walk-on in &quot;Johnny 2 X 4&quot;. By then, she lived with her mother at 75 Bank Street, and in 1942, she was crowned Miss Greenwich Village. As a teenage fashion model, Bacall appeared on the cover of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; and in magazines such as &quot;Vogue&quot;. A 1948 article in &quot;Life&quot; magazine referred to her &quot;cat-like grace, tawny blonde hair, and blue-green eyes.&quot;

Though Diana Vreeland is often credited with discovering Bacall for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, it was in fact Nicolas de Gunzburg who introduced Bacall to Vreeland. He had first met Bacall at a New York club called Tony&#x27;s, where de Gunzburg suggested that Bacall visit his &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; office the next day. He then turned her over to Vreeland, who arranged for Louise Dahl-Wolfe to shoot Bacall in Kodachrome for the March 1943 cover.

The &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; cover caught the attention of &quot;Slim&quot; Keith, the wife of Hollywood producer and director Howard Hawks. Keith urged her husband to invite Bacall to take a screen test for his forthcoming film &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot;. Hawks asked his secretary to find more information about Bacall, but the secretary misunderstood and sent Bacall a ticket to travel to Hollywood for the audition.

==Hollywood==
===1944–1959: Hollywood contract and leading roles ===
After meeting Bacall in Hollywood, Hawks immediately signed her to a seven-year contract with a weekly salary of $100 and personally began to manage her career. He changed her first name to Lauren, and she chose Bacall, a variant of her mother&#x27;s maiden name, as her screen surname. Slim Hawks also took Bacall under her wing, dressing Bacall stylishly and guiding her in matters of elegance, manners and taste. At Hawks&#x27;s suggestion, Bacall was trained by a voice coach to speak with a lower and deeper voice instead of her normally high-pitched, nasal voice. As part of her training, Bacall was required to shout verses of Shakespeare for hours every day. Her voice was characterized as a &quot;smoky, sexual growl&quot; by most critics and a &quot;throaty purr&quot;. Bacall stood , unusually tall for actresses of the era, and a half inch taller than Humphrey Bogart.

During her screen tests for &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; (1944), Bacall was so nervous that, to minimize her quivering, she pressed her chin against her chest, faced the camera and tilted her eyes upward. This effect, which came to be known as &quot;The Look&quot;, became another Bacall trademark, along with her sultry voice. Bacall&#x27;s character in the film used Slim Hawks&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Slim&quot;, and Bogart used Howard Hawks&#x27;s nickname &quot;Steve&quot;. The on-set chemistry between the two was immediate, according to Bacall. She and Bogart, who was unhappily married to Mayo Methot, began a romantic relationship several weeks into shooting. Bacall&#x27;s role in the script was originally much smaller, but during production, the part was revised and extended several times.

After its release, &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; catapulted Bacall into instant stardom, and her performance became the cornerstone of her star image that extended into popular culture at large, even influencing fashion as well as filmmakers and other actors. Warner Bros. launched an extensive marketing campaign to promote the picture and to establish Bacall as a movie star. As part of the public-relations push, Bacall visited the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on February 10, 1945, and sat on a piano as Vice President Harry S. Truman played it.

After &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot;, Bacall appeared with Charles Boyer in &quot;Confidential Agent&quot; (1945), which was poorly received by critics. By her own estimation, she had been terribly miscast and the film could have caused considerable damage to her career, but her next performance as the mysterious, acid-tongued Vivian Rutledge in Hawks&#x27;s film noir &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1946), co-starring Bogart, provided a quick career resurgence. &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; laid the foundation for Bacall&#x27;s status as an icon of film noir, with which she would be strongly associated for the rest of her career. She was often cast in roles that were variations of the independent and sultry &quot;femme fatale&quot; character of Vivian. As described by film scholar Joe McElhaney, &quot;Vivian displays an almost total command of movement and gesture. She never crawls.&quot;

Bacall was cast with Bogart in two more films. In the film noir &quot;Dark Passage&quot; (1947), she played an enigmatic San Francisco artist. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Miss Bacall... generates quite a lot of pressure as a sharp-eyed, knows-what-she-wants girl.&quot; Bacall appeared in John Huston&#x27;s melodramatic suspense film &quot;Key Largo&quot; (1948) with Bogart, Edward G. Robinson and Lionel Barrymore. In the film, according to film critic Jessica Kiang, &quot;Bacall brings an edge of ambivalence and independence to the role that makes her character much more interesting than was written.&quot;
Bacall rejected scripts that she did not find interesting, and thereby earned a reputation of being difficult. However, she further solidified her star status in the 1950s by appearing as the leading lady in a string of films that won favorable reviews. Bacall was cast with Gary Cooper in &quot;Bright Leaf&quot; (1950) and as a two-faced &quot;femme fatale&quot; in &quot;Young Man with a Horn&quot; (1950), a jazz musical co-starring Kirk Douglas, Doris Day and Hoagy Carmichael. From 1951 to 1952, Bacall costarred with Bogart in the syndicated action-adventure radio series &quot;Bold Venture&quot;.

Bacall starred in the first CinemaScope comedy, &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot; (1953), a runaway hit among critics and at the box office that was directed by Jean Negulesco. She received positive notices for her turn as witty gold-digger Schatze Page. &quot;First honors in spreading mirth go to Miss Bacall,&quot; wrote Alton Cook in the &quot;New York World-Telegram &amp; Sun&quot;, &quot;The most intelligent and predatory of the trio, she takes complete control of every scene with her acid delivery of viciously witty lines.&quot; After the success of &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot;, Bacall declined the opportunity to press her handprints and footprints in the Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre&#x27;s famed cement forecourt. She felt that &quot;anyone with a picture opening could be represented there, standards had been so lowered&quot; and did not feel that she had yet achieved the status of a major star, and was thereby unworthy of the honor: &quot;I want to feel I&#x27;ve earned my place with the best my business has produced.&quot;

Bacall was under contract to 20th Century-Fox. Following &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot;, she appeared in yet another CinemaScope comedy directed by Negulesco, &quot;Woman&#x27;s World&quot; (1954), which failed to match its predecessor&#x27;s success at the box office. A television version of Bogart&#x27;s early film success &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot; was performed as a 1955 live installment of the weekly dramatic anthology &quot;Producers&#x27; Showcase&quot;, featuring Bogart in his original role of Duke Mantee and starring Bacall and Henry Fonda. In the late 1990s, Bacall donated the only known kinescope of the performance to the Museum of Television &amp; Radio (now the Paley Center for Media), where it remains archived for viewing in New York City and Los Angeles. Bacall starred in two feature films, &quot;The Cobweb&quot; and &quot;Blood Alley&quot;, both released in 1955. Directed by Vincente Minnelli, &quot;The Cobweb&quot; takes place at a mental institution where Bacall&#x27;s character works as a therapist. It was her second collaboration with Charles Boyer, and the film also stars Richard Widmark and Lillian Gish. A &quot;New York Times&quot; critic wrote: &quot;In the only two really sympathetic roles, Mr. Widmark is excellent and Miss Bacall shrewdly underplays.&quot;

Many film scholars consider &quot;Written on the Wind&quot; (1956), directed by Douglas Sirk, a landmark melodrama. Appearing with Rock Hudson, Dorothy Malone and Robert Stack, Bacall plays a career woman whose life is unexpectedly turned around by a family of oil magnates. Bacall wrote in her autobiography that she did not think much of her role, but reviews were favorable. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Bacall registers strongly as a sensible girl swept into the madness of the oil family.&quot; While supporting Bogart as he suffered from terminal esophageal cancer, Bacall starred with Gregory Peck in &quot;Designing Woman&quot; (1957) to solid reviews. The comedy was her second feature directed by Minnelli and was released in New York on May 16, 1957, four months after Bogart&#x27;s death on January 14. Bacall appeared in two more films in the 1950s: the Negulesco-directed melodrama &quot;The Gift of Love&quot; (1958) with Robert Stack and the British adventure film &quot;North West Frontier&quot; (1959), which was a box-office hit.

===1960–1989: Return to Broadway and musicals ===
Bacall was seen in only a handful of films in the 1960s. She starred on Broadway in &quot;Goodbye, Charlie&quot; in 1959, and went on to a successful stage career. She played Stephanie in the farce &quot;Cactus Flower&quot; (1965). She won her first Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her role as Margo Channing in &quot;Applause&quot; (1970). The musical was written by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. She performed the role both on Broadway and the West End. Walter Kerr of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised her performance declaring, &quot;Take your breath away? Indeed. What&#x27;s more, she never gives it back.&quot; &quot;Applause&quot; was a musical version of the film &quot;All About Eve&quot; (1950), starring Bette Davis, Bacall&#x27;s idol as a child. A young and unknown Bacall had met Davis years earlier in New York. After a performance of &quot;Applause&quot;, Davis visited Bacall backstage and told her, &quot;You&#x27;re the only one who could have played the part.&quot; Bacall would later win the Sarah Siddons Award in 1972 and 1984, an award inspired by the fictional trophy in &quot;All About Eve&quot;.

She returned to Broadway in the musical &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; (1981) with book by Peter Stone and music and lyrics by Kander and Ebb. The musical is based on the 1944 film of the same name starring Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. Frank Rich of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the production a mixed review but praised Bacall writing, &quot;The people who concocted this musical know what their show is really about. Miss Bacall is on hand virtually the whole time, and she&#x27;s vibrant whether no-nonsense or tipsy, domineering or moony, dry or wet. If &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; is tired around the edges, it is always smart enough to keep its live wire center stage.&quot; She went on to win her second Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical.

The few films in which Bacall appeared during this period were all-star vehicles such as &quot;Sex and the Single Girl&quot; (1964) with Henry Fonda, Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood; &quot;Harper&quot; (1966) with Paul Newman, Shelley Winters, Julie Harris, Robert Wagner and Janet Leigh; and &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1974), with Ingrid Bergman, Albert Finney, Vanessa Redgrave, Martin Balsam and Sean Connery. In 1964, Bacall appeared in two episodes of Craig Stevens&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Broadway&quot;: first in &quot;Take a Walk Through a Cemetery&quot; with husband Jason Robards, Jr., and later as Barbara Lake in the episode &quot;Something to Sing About&quot; with Balsam. In 1976, Bacall costarred in &quot;The Shootist &quot;with John Wayne, with whom she had worked in &quot;Blood Alley&quot; (1955).

Bacall was featured in Robert Altman&#x27;s comedy &quot;Health&quot; (1980), which underwent a troubled process of release after the change of the top management at 20th Century-Fox and saw a very limited release in theaters. The following year, she appeared in the thriller &quot;The Fan&quot; (1981). The film received mixed reviews, especially following the recent murder of John Lennon and the similarities of the plot to the real event, but Bacall&#x27;s performance gained a favorable reception. &quot;Variety&quot; magazine wrote that Bacall and director Edward Bianchi &quot;make the audience care what happens&quot; to her character. Bacall took a seven-year hiatus from films to perform on stage in &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; (1981) with costar Harry Guardino, for which she won her second Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical, and other shows such as a 1985 adaptation of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; under the direction of Harold Pinter. She returned to film in 1988 with supporting roles in Danny Huston&#x27;s &quot;Mr. North&quot; and Michael Winner&#x27;s &quot;Appointment with Death&quot;. She also starred in the British thriller &quot;Tree of Hands&quot; (1989), based on a novel by Ruth Rendell, and in a television adaptation of the 1933 classic &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; for Turner Television. 
=== 1990–1999: Film resurgence and West End debut ===
In 1990, Bacall took a small but central role as James Caan&#x27;s agent in Rob Reiner&#x27;s &quot;Misery&quot;, based on the novel by Stephen King, and an important role in the British television movie &quot;A Little Piece of Sunshine&quot;, based on a novel by Frederick Forsyth. The following year, Bacall played the lead in the independent film &quot;A Star for Two&quot; (1991) with Anthony Quinn, Lila Kedrova and Jean-Pierre Aumont, and played a supporting role in &quot;All I Want for Christmas&quot; (1991).

In 1993, Bacall was very active in television, pairing again with her lifelong friend Gregory Peck and his daughter Cecilia Peck in Arthur Penn&#x27;s television movie &quot;The Portrait&quot;, and costarring with an all-star European cast in &quot;A Foreign Field&quot;. She appeared in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Prêt-à-Porter&quot; (1994), an ensemble film set in Paris during fashion week. In 1995, she was cast in her friend Ingrid Bergman&#x27;s role in &quot;From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler&quot;, a television remake of the 1973 movie by the same title. Years earlier, Bergman had played the role in the film version of &quot;Cactus Flower&quot; (1969) that Bacall had played on Broadway in 1965. In 1995 portrayed Claire Zachanassian in the Terrence McNally play &quot;The Visit&quot; at the Chichester Festival.

1996 was a pivotal year for Bacall&#x27;s career. She was chosen by Barbra Streisand to play her mother in the romantic comedy &quot;The Mirror Has Two Faces&quot;, also starring Jeff Bridges, George Segal and Brenda Vaccaro. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote of her performance &quot;Bacall, posing, rolling her eyes and snapping out the one-liners with consummate skill, is in to play the source of all of Rose’s insecurities, the mother who was drop-dead gorgeous and who never told her kind of funny-looking daughter she was pretty.&quot; She received widespread critical acclaim, and at age 72, she earned her first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, which she was widely expected to win, but lost to Juliette Binoche for &quot;The English Patient&quot;. She also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role, and a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.

Bacall received the Kennedy Center Honors in 1997, and she was voted one of the 25 most significant female movie stars in history in 1999 by the American Film Institute. In 1999, Bacall starred on Broadway in a revival of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Waiting in the Wings&quot;. She portrayed American billionaire heiress Doris Duke in the four part CBS miniseries &quot;Too Rich: The Secret Life of Doris Duke&quot; (1999). In the 2000s, she acted as a spokesman for the Tuesday Morning discount chain and produced a jewelry line. She was also a celebrity spokesman for High Point coffee and Fancy Feast cat food.

=== 2000–2009: Dramatic films and final roles ===

Her film career saw something of a renaissance taking dramatic roles in independent films. She attracted positive notices for her performances in high-profile psychological dramas such as Lars von Trier&#x27;s &quot;Dogville&quot; (2003) and Jonathan Glazer&#x27;s &quot;Birth&quot; (2004), both with Nicole Kidman. She voiced Witch of the Waste in Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s acclaimed animated film &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot; (2004). She was a leading actress in Paul Schrader&#x27;s &quot;The Walker&quot; (2007). In March 2006, she introduced a film montage dedicated to film noir at the 78th Academy Awards. She made a cameo appearance as herself on &quot;The Sopranos&quot; in the April 2006 episode &quot;Luxury Lounge&quot;, during which her character was mugged by Christopher Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli).

In September 2006, Bryn Mawr College awarded Bacall its Katharine Hepburn Medal, which recognizes &quot;women whose lives, work, and contributions embody the intelligence, drive, and independence&quot; of Hepburn. She delivered an address at the memorial service of Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. at the Reform Club in London in June 2007. She finished her role in &quot;The Forger&quot; in 2009. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences bestowed an honorary Academy Award upon Bacall at the inaugural Governors Awards on November 14, 2009. In July 2013, Bacall expressed interest in the film &quot;Trouble Is My Business&quot;. In November, she joined the English-dubbed voice cast for StudioCanal&#x27;s animated film &quot;Ernest &amp; Celestine&quot;. Her final role was in 2014 as a guest voice appearance in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Mom&#x27;s the Word&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and family===

On May 21, 1945, Bacall married Humphrey Bogart; she was 20 and Bogart was 45. Their wedding and honeymoon took place at Malabar Farm, Lucas, Ohio, the country home of Pulitzer Prize–winning author Louis Bromfield, a close friend of Bogart. At the time of the 1950 United States census, the couple was living at 2707 Benedict Canyon Drive in Beverly Hills with their son and their nursemaid. Bacall is listed as Betty Bogart. She was married to Bogart until he died in 1957.

During the filming of &quot;The African Queen&quot; (1951), Bacall and Bogart became friends with Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. She began to mix in non-acting circles, becoming friends with the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. and the journalist Alistair Cooke. In 1952, she gave campaign speeches for Democratic presidential contender Adlai Stevenson. Along with other Hollywood figures, Bacall was a strong opponent of McCarthyism.

Bacall had a relationship with Frank Sinatra after Bogart&#x27;s death. During an interview with Turner Classic Movies&#x27;s Robert Osborne, Bacall stated that she had ended the romance, but, in her autobiography &quot;Lauren Bacall by Myself&quot;, she wrote that Sinatra ended the relationship abruptly after becoming upset that his marriage proposal had been leaked to the press, believing Bacall to be responsible. However, Bacall states in &quot;Lauren Bacall by Myself&quot; that when she was out with her friend Irving &quot;Swifty&quot; Lazar, they encountered the gossip columnist Louella Parsons, to whom Lazar revealed the news. Bacall wrote in &quot;By Myself&quot; that Sinatra only found out the truth years later.

Bacall then met and began a relationship with Jason Robards. Their wedding was originally scheduled to take place in Vienna, Austria, on June 16, 1961. The wedding plans were shelved after Austrian authorities refused to grant the couple a marriage license, due to Robards being unable to produce divorce documents from his previous marriage, and Bacall being unable to produce Humphrey Bogart&#x27;s death certificate. They were also refused a marriage in Las Vegas, Nevada, due to similar documentation issues. On July 4, 1961, the couple drove to Ensenada, Mexico, where they wed. The couple divorced in 1969. According to Bacall&#x27;s autobiography, she divorced Robards mainly because of his alcoholism.

Bacall had a romantic relationship with her &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; costar Harry Guardino in the early 1980s.

Bacall had two children with Bogart and one with Robards. Son Stephen Humphrey Bogart (born January 6, 1949) is a news producer, documentary film maker, and author who is named after Bogart&#x27;s character in &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot;. Their daughter Leslie Howard Bogart (born August 23, 1952) is named after the actor Leslie Howard. A nurse and yoga instructor, she is married to Erich Schiffmann. In his 1995 memoir, Stephen Bogart wrote, &quot;My mother was a lapsed Jew, and my father was a lapsed Episcopalian&quot;, and that he and his sister were raised Episcopalian &quot;because my mother felt that would make life easier for Leslie and me during those post-World War II years&quot;. Sam Robards (born December 16, 1961), Bacall&#x27;s son with Robards, is an actor.

Bacall wrote two autobiographies, &quot;Lauren Bacall by Myself&quot; (1978) and &quot;Now&quot; (1994). In 2006, the first volume of &quot;Lauren Bacall by Myself&quot; was reprinted as &quot;By Myself and Then Some&quot; with an extra chapter.

In a 1996 interview, Bacall, reflecting on her life, told the interviewer Jeremy Isaacs that she had been lucky: 

I had one great marriage, I have three great children and four grandchildren. I am still alive. I still can function. I still can work ... You just learn to cope with whatever you have to cope with. I spent my childhood in New York, riding on subways and buses. And you know what you learn if you&#x27;re a New Yorker? The world doesn&#x27;t owe you a damn thing.
===Political views===

Bacall was a staunch liberal Democrat, and proclaimed her political views on numerous occasions. Bacall and Bogart were among about 80 Hollywood personalities to send a telegram protesting the House Un-American Activities Committee&#x27;s investigations of Americans suspected of adhering to communism. The telegram said that investigating individuals&#x27; political beliefs violated the basic principles of American democracy. In October 1947, Bacall and Bogart traveled to Washington, D.C., along with a number of other Hollywood stars in a group that called itself the Committee for the First Amendment (CFA), which also included Danny Kaye, John Garfield, Gene Kelly, John Huston, Groucho Marx, Olivia de Havilland, Ira Gershwin, and Jane Wyatt.

She appeared alongside Humphrey Bogart in a photograph printed at the end of an article he wrote, titled &quot;I&#x27;m No Communist&quot;, in the May 1948 edition of &quot;Photoplay&quot; magazine, written to counteract negative publicity resulting from his appearance before the House Committee. Bogart and Bacall distanced themselves from the Hollywood Ten, and said: &quot;We&#x27;re about as much in favor of Communism as J. Edgar Hoover.&quot;

Bacall campaigned for Democratic candidate Adlai Stevenson in the 1952 presidential election, accompanying him on motorcades along with Bogart, and flying east to help in the final laps of Stevenson&#x27;s campaign in New York and Chicago. She campaigned for Robert F. Kennedy in his 1964 run for the U.S. Senate and was part of a Hollywood committee that endorsed his presidential campaign.

In a 2005 interview with Larry King, Bacall described herself as &quot;anti-Republican... A liberal. The L-word&quot;. She added that &quot;being a liberal is the best thing on Earth you can be. You are welcoming to everyone when you&#x27;re a liberal. You do not have a small mind.&quot;

===Death===
On August 12, 2014, Bacall died after suffering a stroke at her apartment in The Dakota, the Upper West Side building near Central Park in Manhattan. She was confirmed dead at New York–Presbyterian Hospital, at the age of 89.

Bacall was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. At the time of her death, Bacall had an estimated $26.6 million estate. The bulk of her estate was divided among her three children: Leslie Bogart, Stephen Humphrey Bogart, and Sam Robards. Additionally, Bacall left $250,000 each to her youngest grandsons, the sons of Sam Robards, for college.

<text>Steven Howse (born September 23, 1974), known professionally as Layzie Bone, is a rapper known primarily for being a member of the group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. He has also gone by the names L-Burna, Lil Lay, and The #1 Assassin. He is the younger brother of fellow group member Flesh-N-Bone and cousin of group member Wish Bone. Layzie is also a member of the rap group Bone Brothers and CEO of the record label Harmony Howse Entertainment.

== Music career ==
The group formed the band B.O.N.E. Enterpri$e (all except for Flesh-N-Bone) and recorded an album entitled &quot;Faces of Death&quot; in the studio of their then-mentor, Kermit Henderson, on his indie label Stoney Burke in 1993. After this Layzie and the rest of the Bone Family boarded a Greyhound Bus to Los Angeles where they worked with notable producer and rapper Eazy-E and his Ruthless/Relativity Records label. Diego Blak (born Diego Hodge), a marketer and promoter and co-executive producer of &quot;Faces of Death&quot;, introduced them to Eazy-E at a concert he promoted in Cleveland, Ohio, where they auditioned for him in his dressing room and then traveled back to Los Angeles after the show to seal the deal. At this point Eazy named them Thugs-n-Harmony but they wanted to keep the Bone name so they were called Bone Thugs-N-Harmony.

=== Solo career, Mo Thugs &amp; Bone Brothers ===
Layzie has also promoted the indie label Mo Thugs Records which he and the rest of Bone originated. He released his first solo album Thug By Nature on March 20, 2001, exactly the same day Bizzy Bone released his second solo album, &quot;The Gift&quot;. He also has collaborative albums with Young Noble from The Outlawz and A.K. of Do or Die, solo albums out such as It&#x27;s Not A Game, The New Revolution, Cleveland, Startin&#x27; from Scratch: How A Thug Was Born, and Thugz Nation. He has had a series of albums with Bizzy Bone; Still Creepin On Ah Come Up and under the name Bone Brothers entitled: Bone Brothers, Bone Brothers 2, Bone Brothers 3. 

=== New Label and CEO ===

In the fall of 2010, Layzie established a new label, Harmony Howse Entertainment. In 2011, he and Fredro Starr of the Onyx group were planning on releasing a collaborative EP entitled &quot;FireSquad&quot;. Layzie would go on to release two separate albums The Definition and The Meaning on February 22, 2011 under his new label Harmony Howse Entertainment. In 2015 Layzie released the single &quot;Cleveland is The City&quot; Featuring Aaron &quot;D-Boyy&quot; Dissell. The song was used by Fox News during the 2015 NBA Finals as the Cleveland Cavaliers theme song. Layzie was also working on an album called &quot;Perfect Timing&quot;, which was originally scheduled to be released in 2016, but is now TBD. Layzie is the uncle of the independent rapper, Dizzy Wright.

=== Feud with Migos ===

During a brief feud with Migos, Layzie Bone would release the album &quot;Annihilation&quot; on April 19, 2019, featuring the song &quot;If was a 5th&quot; featuring Bizzy Bone, and the diss song &quot;Let me go Migo (Remix)&quot;.

<text>Alistair Stuart MacLean (; 21 April 1922 – 2 February 1987) was a Scottish novelist who wrote popular thrillers and adventure stories. Many of his novels have been adapted to film, most notably &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1957) and &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot; (1963). In the late 1960s, encouraged by film producer Elliott Kastner, MacLean began to write original screenplays, concurrently with an accompanying novel. The most successful was the first of these, the 1968 film &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;, which was also a bestselling novel. MacLean also published two novels under the pseudonym Ian Stuart. His books are estimated to have sold over 150 million copies, making him one of the best-selling fiction authors of all time.

According to one obituary, &quot;he never lost his love for the sea, his talent for portraying good Brits against bad Germans, or his penchant for high melodrama. Critics deplored his cardboard characters and vapid females, but readers loved his combination of hot macho action, wartime commando sagas, and exotic settings that included Greek Islands and Alaskan oil fields.&quot;

==Early life==
Alistair Stuart Maclean was born on 21 April 1922 in Shettleston, Glasgow, the third of four sons of a Church of Scotland minister, but spent much of his childhood and youth in Daviot, south of Inverness. He spoke only Scottish Gaelic before attending school.

In 1941, at the age of 19, he was called up to fight in the Second World War with the Royal Navy, serving with the ranks of ordinary seaman, able seaman, and leading torpedo operator. He was first assigned to PS &quot;Bournemouth Queen&quot;, a converted excursion ship fitted for antiaircraft guns, on duty off the coasts of England and Scotland. Beginning in 1943, he served on , a &quot;Dido&quot;-class light cruiser. There, he saw action in 1943 in the Atlantic theatre, on two Arctic convoys and escorting aircraft carrier groups in operations against , and other targets off the Norwegian coast. He took part in Convoy PQ 17 on &quot;Royalist&quot;. In 1944, &quot;Royalist&quot; and he served in the Mediterranean theatre, as part of the invasion of southern France and in helping to sink blockade runners off Crete and bombard Milos in the Aegean. During this time, MacLean may have been injured in a gunnery-practice accident. In 1945, in the Far East theatre, MacLean and &quot;Royalist&quot; saw action escorting carrier groups in operations against Japanese targets in Burma, Malaya, and Sumatra. (MacLean&#x27;s late-in-life claims that he was captured by the Japanese after blowing up bridges, and tortured by having his teeth pulled out, have been dismissed by both his son and his biographer as drunken ravings). After the Japanese surrender, &quot;Royalist&quot; helped evacuate liberated POWs from Changi Prison in Singapore.

MacLean was discharged from the Royal Navy in 1946. He then studied English at the University of Glasgow, working at the post office and as a street sweeper. He lived with his mother at 26 Carrington Street, at St Georges Cross, Glasgow while attending the university. He graduated with an MA (Hons.) in 1950, briefly worked as a hospital porter, and then worked as a schoolteacher at Gallowflat School (now Stonelaw High School) in Rutherglen.

==Early writing career==
===First works===
Whilst a university student, MacLean began writing short stories for extra income, winning a competition in 1954 with the maritime story &quot;Dileas&quot;. He sold stories to the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and &quot;The Evening News&quot;. The wife of Ian Chapman, editor at the publishing company Collins, had been particularly moved by &quot;Dileas&quot; and the Chapmans arranged to meet with MacLean, suggesting he write a novel. MacLean responded three months later with &quot;HMS Ulysses&quot;, based on his own war experiences and credited insight from his brother Ian, a master mariner.

MacLean later described his writing process:

MacLean was paid a large advance of $50,000, which made the headlines. Collins were rewarded when the book sold a quarter of a million copies in hardback in the UK in the first six months of publication. It went on to sell millions more. Film rights were sold to Robert Clark of Associated British for £30,000, though a film was never made. This money meant MacLean was able to devote himself to writing full-time.

===&quot;Guns of Navarone&quot;===
His next novel, &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1957), was about an attack on the fictitious island of Navarone (based on Milos). The book was very successful, selling over 400,000 copies in its first six months. In 1957, MacLean said, &quot;I&#x27;m not a literary person. If someone offered me £100,000 tax free, I&#x27;d never write another word.&quot; The film version of &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961) was hugely successful.

MacLean was unhappy at the tax paid on earnings for his first two novels, so he moved to Lake Lucerne in Switzerland, where he would pay less tax. He planned to write one novel a year. &quot;It&#x27;s all the market can stand,&quot; he said, adding it took him three months to write it.

MacLean followed it with &quot;South by Java Head&quot; (1958), based on his experiences in the seas off Southeast Asia in World War Two. Film rights for &quot;South by Java Head&quot; were sold, but no movie resulted.

&quot;The Last Frontier&quot; (1959), was a thriller about the Hungarian uprising of 1956. &quot;The Last Frontier&quot; was turned into a movie, &quot;The Secret Ways&quot; (1961), which was not very successful.

His next novels were &quot;Night Without End&quot; (1959) and &quot;Fear Is the Key&quot; (1961).

===Ian Stuart===
In the early 1960s, MacLean published two novels under the pseudonym &quot;Ian Stuart&quot; to prove that the popularity of his books was due to their content rather than his name on the cover. These were &quot;The Dark Crusader&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Satan Bug&quot; (1962). He also said it was because &quot;I usually write adventure stories, but this is a sort of Secret Service or private eye book. I didn&#x27;t want to confuse my readers.&quot;

The Ian Stuart books sold well, and MacLean made no attempt to change his writing style. He also continued to publish novels under his own name such as &quot;The Golden Rendezvous&quot; (1962) and &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot; (1963).

&quot;I&#x27;m not a novelist&quot;, he once said. &quot;That&#x27;s too pretentious a claim. I&#x27;m a storyteller, that&#x27;s all. I&#x27;m a professional and a craftsman. I will make that claim for myself.&quot; MacLean also claimed he wrote very fast (35 days for a novel) because he disliked writing and the &quot;sooner he finished, the better.&quot; He never reread a book after it was finished. His novels were notable for their lack of sex. &quot;I like girls&quot;, he said. &quot;I just don&#x27;t write them well. Everyone knows that men and women make love, laddie – there is no need to show it.&quot;

===Retirement===
In 1963, MacLean decided to retire from writing, saying he never enjoyed it and only did it to make money. He decided to become a hotelier and bought the Jamaica Inn on Bodmin Moor and then bought two more hotels, the Bank House near Worcester and the Bean Bridge at Wellington in Somerset. MacLean focused on his hotel career for three years. It was not a success, and by 1976, he had sold all three hotels. During this time, a film was made of &quot;The Satan Bug&quot;.

==Return to writing==
===Screenwriter===
MacLean returned to writing with &quot;When Eight Bells Toll&quot; (1966).

Cinema producer Elliot Kastner admired MacLean, and asked him if he would be interested in writing an original screenplay. MacLean agreed to the proposition, and Kastner sent the writer two scripts, one by William Goldman and one by Robert and Jane Howard-Carrington, to familiarize himself with the format. Kastner said he wanted a World War Two story with a group of men on a mission to rescue someone, with a &quot;ticking clock&quot; and some female characters. MacLean agreed to write it for an initial $10,000 with $100,000 to come later. This script was &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;.

In July 1966, Kastner and his producing partner Jerry Gershwin announced they had purchased five screenplays from MacLean: &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;, &quot;When Eight Bells Toll&quot;, and three other unnamed ones. (Kastner made four MacLean movies.) MacLean also wrote a novel for &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;, after the screenplay, which was published in 1967 before the film came out. The book was a bestseller, and the 1968 film version was a huge hit.

&quot;MacLean is a natural storyteller&quot;, said Kastner. &quot;He is a master of adventure. All his books are conceived in cinematic terms. They hardly need to be adapted for the screen; when you read them, the screen is in front of your mind.&quot; MacLean wrote a sequel to &quot;Guns of Navarone&quot;, &quot;Force 10 from Navarone&quot; (1968). A film version was announced in 1967, but did not result for another decade. The same year, an expensive film based on &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot; was released.

===Producer===
In 1967, MacLean formed a partnership with Geoffrey Reeve and Lewis Jenkins to make films for MacLean to write and Reeves to direct. They planned to make a sequel to &quot;Guns of Navarone&quot;, only to discover that Carl Foreman, producer of the original film, had registered the title &quot;After Navarone&quot;. This led to a falling-out with Foreman, and a delay in the &quot;Navarone&quot; sequel.

Maclean wrote a thriller about narcotics, &quot;Puppet on a Chain&quot; (1969), and &quot;Caravan to Vaccarès&quot; (1970). These books all began as screenplays for Kastner. Maclean said &quot;Puppet&quot; was &quot;a change of style from the earlier books. If I went on writing the same stuff, I&#x27;d be guying myself.&quot;

When &quot;Puppet on a Chain&quot; was made, Maclean said, &quot;I&#x27;ve been connected with it for three years and it&#x27;s too much for me. All those entrepreneurs and promoters who aren&#x27;t creative. All that time wasted.&quot;

&quot;There is nobody to touch him,&quot; said Ian Chapman. &quot;But he is a storyteller, not a film man.&quot;

MacLean then wrote &quot;Bear Island&quot; (1971), the last of his first-person narratives.

MacLean moved to Switzerland in 1970 as a tax exile. That year, he said, &quot;there&#x27;s Harold Robbins, Agatha Christie, Georges Simenon, and me.&quot; He added, &quot;I&#x27;m a storyteller, that&#x27;s all. There&#x27;s no art in it, no mystique. It&#x27;s a job like any other. The secret, if there is one, is speed. That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s so little sex in my books – it holds up the action.&quot; He said he enjoyed the plotting &quot;but the rest is a pain.&quot;

In 1970 MacLean, whose hero was Raymond Chandler, said &quot;give me ten years, a few more books, and maybe, maybe I&#x27;ll be half as good as Chandler.&quot;

Kastner produced a film version of &quot;When Eight Bells Toll&quot; (1971), based on a script by MacLean, and &quot;Fear Is the Key&quot; (1972), adapted by another writer. Another producer made &quot;Puppet on a Chain&quot; (1971), directed by Reeves, from a script by MacLean. Neither performed particularly strongly at the box office.

===Mary MacLean===
In 1972, MacLean married his second wife, Mary Georgius. She planned to produce three films based on his books, but the box-office failure of the last three MacLean adaptations put these on hold. One of these proposed films was &quot;The Way to Dusty Death&quot;, which was to star Jackie Stewart. It ended up being a 1973 novel and a 1995 film.

In 1973, MacLean was looking at moving to Jamaica. He also considered moving to Ireland, but decided to stay in Switzerland.

Geoffrey Reeve directed a film of &quot;Caravan to Vaccarès&quot; (1974). By 1973, MacLean had sold over 24 million novels. &quot;I am not a writer,&quot; he said in 1972. &quot;I am a businessman. My business is writing.&quot; MacLean had spent a number of years focusing on screenplays, but disliked it and decided to return to being predominantly a novel writer. &quot;Hollywood destroys writers,&quot; he said. He wrote a biography of Captain James Cook, which was published in 1972. He wrote &quot;Breakheart Pass&quot; (1974), &quot;Circus&quot; (1975), &quot;The Golden Gate&quot; (1976), &quot;Seawitch&quot; (1977), &quot;Goodbye California&quot; (1979) and &quot;Athabasca&quot; (1980).

&quot;I read a lot, I travel some,&quot; he said in 1975. &quot;But mostly what I don&#x27;t know, I invent.&quot; In 1976, he was living in Los Angeles and said he wanted to write a four-volume serious piece called &quot;The Rembrandt Quarter&quot; based on the painting &quot;The Night Watch&quot;. These books were never published.

In 1977, it was announced MacLean, then worth £5 million, would divorce Mary, who said the author was impossible to live with.

In 1978, MacLean said he &quot;just can&#x27;t understand&quot; why people bought his novels. &quot;It&#x27;s not as if I write that well: I do feel my English isn&#x27;t very good. In fact, I&#x27;d rather write in Gaelic or Spanish than English.&quot;

He said his stories tended to pit &quot;character against character as a kind of intellectual chess game&quot; and that he found writing &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;lonely&quot;, but &quot;I guess it all boils down to that rather awful philosophy of take the money and run.&quot; &quot;I am just a journeyman,&quot; he said. &quot;I blunder along from one book to the next always hopeful that one day I will write something really good.&quot;

Films were still being made out of his novels, including &quot;Breakheart Pass&quot; (1975) (from Kastner), &quot;Golden Rendezvous&quot; (1977), &quot;Force 10 from Navarone&quot; (1978), and &quot;Bear Island&quot; (1979), but none did very well.

In 1976, MacLean&#x27;s second wife Mary formed a company with producer Peter Snell, Aleelle Productions, which aimed to make movies based on MacLean novels, including &quot;Golden Gate&quot;, &quot;Bear Island&quot;, &quot;The Way to Dusty Death&quot;, and &quot;Captain Cook&quot;. This company still owned these film rights after MacLean divorced Mary in 1977, but the rights soon passed to Snell.

MacLean decided to focus on American television, writing a novella titled &quot;Air Force One is Down&quot;, which was turned down by the American television network NBC (it would be produced in 2012). He then pitched six new ideas to networks, each with a 25– to 30-page synopsis to see which was commercially viable before &quot;The Hostage Tower&quot; was approved by CBS, and aired on American television in 1980.

===Later career===
His later works include &quot;River of Death&quot; (1981) (filmed in 1989), &quot;Partisans&quot; (1982), &quot;Floodgate&quot; (1983), and &quot;San Andreas&quot; (1984). Often, these novels were worked on by ghost writers specializing in drama, with MacLean providing only the plots and characters. His last novel was &quot;Santorini&quot; (1986), which was published after his death. His estate left behind several outlines. One of them was filmed as &quot;Death Train&quot; (1993). His later books were not as well received as the earlier publications, and in an attempt to keep his stories in keeping with the time, he sometimes lapsed into unduly improbable plots.

==Death==
MacLean died of heart failure at the age of 64 in Munich on 2 February 1987; his last years were affected by alcoholism. According to one obituary, &quot;A master of nail-chewing suspense, MacLean met an appropriately mysterious death; when he died in the Bavarian capital after a brief illness, no one, including the British Embassy, knew what he was doing there.&quot;
He is buried in the Old Cemetery (&quot;Vieux Cimetière&quot;) of Céligny, Switzerland, close to the grave of his friend Richard Burton.

==Personal life==
He was married twice and had three sons (one adopted) by his first wife, Gisela. He married for a second time in 1972; that marriage ended in divorce in 1977.
His niece Shona MacLean (also published under S.G. Maclean) is a writer and historical novelist.

MacLean was awarded a doctor of letters by the University of Glasgow in 1983.

==Critical appraisal==
Writer Algis Budrys described MacLean&#x27;s writing style as - &quot;hit &#x27;em with everything but the kitchen sink, then give &#x27;em the sink, and when they raise their heads, drop the plumber on &#x27;em&quot;.
Screenwriter Derek Kolstad, who wrote the&quot; John Wick&quot; film series, cited MacLean and Stephen King as among his primary influences.

<text>Michael Bruce (27 March 1746 – 5 July 1767) was a Scottish poet and hymnist.

== Early life ==
Bruce was born at Kinnesswood in the parish of Portmoak, Kinross-shire. His father, Alexander Bruce, was a weaver. Michael was taught to read before he was four years old, and one of his favourite books was a copy of Sir David Lyndsay&#x27;s works. His attendance at school was often interrupted, because he had to herd cattle on the Lomond Hills in summer, and this early companionship with nature greatly influenced his poetry. A delicate child, he grew up as the pet of his family and friends. He studied Latin and Greek, and at fifteen, when his schooling was completed, a small legacy left to his mother, with some additions from kindly neighbours, enabled him to go to the University of Edinburgh, which he attended during the four winter sessions 1762–1765.

== Adult life ==

In 1765 he taught during the summer months at Gairney Bridge, receiving about 5/- a year in fees and free board in a pupil&#x27;s home. He became a divinity student at the Theological Hall, Kinross, with a Scottish seceding church, classified at that time as the Burghers. Bruce was sincere in his Christian deportment and it was said of him &#x27;Religion was obviously with him a matter of experience&#x27;.,&#x27;only an evangelical Christian of reformed faith could have penned his hymns and paraphrases&#x27;. In the first summer (1766) of his course at Kinross he was put in charge of a new school at Forestmill, near Clackmannan, where he led a life marred by poverty, disease and loneliness. There he wrote &quot;Lochleven,&quot; a poem inspired by the memories of his childhood, which shows the influence of Thomson and confirmed his reputation as a &#x27;local poet and one of the heralds of the later outburst of Scottish song &#x27;. He had already been threatened with consumption, and now became seriously ill. During the winter he returned on foot to his father&#x27;s house, where he wrote his last and finest poem, &quot;Elegy written in Spring&quot; considered among &#x27; the sweetest and most moving compositions in the English language&#x27;. He died in 1767, cheerful to the last.
A poetical genius James Grant Wilson said of him in 1876, &#x27;cut off in life&#x27;s green spring&#x27;

== Logan Issue ==
As a poet his reputation spread, through sympathy for his early death; and also because of the alleged theft by John Logan of several of his poems. Logan, a fellow-student of Bruce, obtained Bruce&#x27;s manuscripts from his father, shortly after the poet&#x27;s death. For the letters, poems, etc., that he allowed to pass out of his hands, Alexander Bruce took no receipt and did not keep any list of the titles. Logan edited in 1770 &quot;Poems on Several Occasions, by Michael Bruce&quot;, in which the &quot;Ode to the Cuckoo&quot; appeared. In the preface he stated that &quot;to make up a miscellany, some poems written by different authors are inserted.&quot; In a collection of his own poems in 1781, Logan printed the &quot;Ode to the Cuckoo&quot; as his own; the friends of Bruce did not challenge its appropriation publicly but Dr Davidson, Professor of Natural &amp; Civil History wrote at the time that he saw a copy of the &quot;Ode to the Cuckoo&quot; in the possession of a friend, in Bruce&#x27;s handwriting, and signed by Bruce, with the words &#x27;you think I might have been better employed than writing about a gowk (cuckoo)&#x27;. In a manuscript &quot;Pious Memorials of Portmoak&quot;, drawn up by Bruce&#x27;s friend, David Pearson, Bruce&#x27;s authorship of the &quot;Ode to the Cuckoo&quot; is emphatically asserted.
This book was in the possession of the Birrell family, and John Birrell, another friend of the poet, adds a testimony to the same effect. Pearson and Birrell also wrote to Dr Robert Anderson while he was publishing his &quot;British Poets&quot;, pointing out Bruce&#x27;s claims. Their communications were used by Anderson in the &quot;Life&quot; prefixed to Logan&#x27;s works in the &quot;British Poets&quot; (vol. ii. p. 1029). The volume of 1770 had struck Bruce&#x27;s friends as being incomplete, and his father missed his son&#x27;s &quot;Gospel Sonnets,&quot; which are supposed by the partisans of Bruce against Logan to have been the hymns printed in the 1781 edition of Logan&#x27;s poems. Logan tried to prevent by law the reprinting of Bruce&#x27;s poems (see James Mackenzie&#x27;s &quot;Life of Michael Bruce&quot;, 1905, chap. xii.), but the book was printed in 1782, 1784, 1796 and 1807.

Dr William McKelvie revived Bruce&#x27;s claims in &quot;Lochleven and Other Poems, by Michael Bruce, with a Life of the Author from Original Sources&quot; (1837). Logan&#x27;s claim to authorship rests on the publication of the poems under his own name, and his reputation as author during his lifetime. His failure to produce the &quot;poem book&quot; of Bruce entrusted to him, and the fact that no copy of the &quot;Ode to the Cuckoo&quot; in his handwriting was known to exist during Bruce&#x27;s lifetime, make it difficult to relieve him of the charge of plagiarism. John Veitch, in &quot;The Feeling for Nature in Scottish Poetry&quot; (1887, vol. ii. pp. 89–91), points out that the stanza known to be Logan&#x27;s addition to this ode is out of keeping with the rest of the poem, and is in the manner of Logan&#x27;s established compositions, in which there is nothing to suggest the direct simplicity of the little poem on the cuckoo.

<doc id="261096" wikidata="Q696479" url="?curid=261096" title="Battle of the Eastern Solomons">
<text>The naval Battle of the Eastern Solomons (also known as the Battle of the Stewart Islands and in Japanese sources as the Second Battle of the Solomon Sea) took place on 24–25 August 1942 and was the third carrier battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II and the second major engagement fought between the United States Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during the Guadalcanal campaign. As at the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway, the ships of the two adversaries were never within sight of each other. Instead, all attacks were carried out by carrier-based or land-based aircraft.

After several damaging air attacks, the naval surface combatants from both America and Japan withdrew from the battle area. Although neither side secured a clear victory, the U.S. and its allies gained a tactical and strategic advantage. Japan&#x27;s losses were greater and included dozens of aircraft and their experienced aircrews. Also, Japanese reinforcements intended for Guadalcanal were delayed and eventually delivered by warships rather than transport ships, giving the Allies more time to prepare for the Japanese counteroffensive and preventing the Japanese from landing heavy artillery, ammunition, and other supplies.

==Background==

On 7 August, Allied forces, consisting mainly of U.S. Marine Corps units, landed on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and the Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands. The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as bases to threaten supply routes between the U.S. and Australia, and secure the islands as launching points for a campaign with an eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at Rabaul while also supporting the Allied New Guinea campaign. The landings initiated the six-month-long Guadalcanal campaign.
The Allied landings were directly supported by three U.S. aircraft carrier task forces (TFs): TF 11 centered around ; TF 16 based on ; and TF 18 formed around ; their respective air groups; and supporting surface warships, including a battleship, four cruisers, and 11 destroyers. Not all of the ships were U.S. warships; attached to TF 18 was TF 44, commanded by Victor Alexander Charles Crutchley, which included the Royal Australian Navy cruisers and . The overall commander of the three carrier task forces was Vice Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher, who flew his flag on &quot;Saratoga&quot;. The aircraft from the three carriers provided close air support for the invasion forces and defended against Japanese air attacks from Rabaul. After a successful landing, they remained in the South Pacific Area charged with four main objectives: guarding the line of communication between the major Allied bases at New Caledonia and Espiritu Santo; giving support to Allied ground forces at Guadalcanal and Tulagi against possible Japanese counteroffensives; covering the movement of supply ships aiding Guadalcanal; and engaging and destroying any Japanese warships that came within range.

Between 15 and 20 August, the U.S. carriers covered the delivery of fighter and bomber aircraft to the newly opened Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. This small, hard-won airfield was a critical point in the entire island chain, and both sides considered that control of the airbase offered potential control of the local airspace. In fact, Henderson Field and the aircraft based there were able to limit the movement of Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands and assist in the attrition of Japanese air forces in the South Pacific Area. Allied control of Henderson Field became the key factor in the entire battle for Guadalcanal.

Surprised by the Allied offensive in the Solomons, Japanese naval forces, commanded by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, and army forces prepared a counteroffensive, with the goal of driving the Allies from Guadalcanal and Tulagi. The counteroffensive was called &quot;Operation Ka&quot;, from the first syllable in the Japanese name for Guadalcanal. The naval forces had the additional objective of destroying Allied warship forces in the South Pacific Area, specifically the U.S. carriers.

==Battle==
===Prelude===
On 16 August, a Japanese convoy of three slow transport ships loaded with 1,411 soldiers from the 28th &quot;Ichiki&quot; Infantry Regiment, as well as several hundred naval troops from the 5th Yokosuka Special Naval Landing Force, departed the major Japanese base at Truk Lagoon (Chuuk) and headed towards Guadalcanal. The transports were guarded by the light cruiser , eight destroyers, and four patrol boats, with the escort force commanded by Rear Admiral Raizō Tanaka, who flew his flag in &quot;Jintsū&quot;. Also departing from Rabaul to help protect the convoy was a &quot;close cover force&quot; of four heavy cruisers from the 8th Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa. These were the same, relatively old, heavy cruisers that had defeated an Allied naval surface force in the earlier Battle of Savo Island, less , which had been sunk by an American submarine on her journey from that battle to her base. The four heavy cruisers of Mikawa&#x27;s group left the Shortlands on 23 August and became tangentially involved, dropping bombs on Henderson Field during the following nights with their float planes. Tanaka planned to land the troops from his convoy on Guadalcanal on 24 August.

On 21 August, the rest of the Japanese &quot;Ka&quot; naval force departed Truk, heading for the southern Solomons. These ships were divided into three groups. The &quot;main body&quot; contained the Japanese carriers and , the light carrier , and a screening force of one heavy cruiser and eight destroyers, commanded by Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo in &quot;Shōkaku&quot;. The &quot;vanguard force&quot; consisted of two battleships, three heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, and six destroyers, commanded by Rear Admiral Hiroaki Abe. The &quot;advanced force&quot; contained five heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, five destroyers, the seaplane carrier , and a &quot;covering group&quot; consisting of the battleship &quot;Mutsu&quot; and three destroyers, commanded by Vice Admiral Nobutake Kondō. Finally, a force of about 100 IJN land-based bombers, fighters, and reconnaissance aircraft at Rabaul and nearby islands were positioned for operational support. Nagumo&#x27;s main body positioned itself behind the &quot;vanguard&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot; forces in an attempt to more easily remain hidden from U.S. reconnaissance aircraft.

The &quot;Ka&quot; plan dictated that once U.S. carriers were located, either by Japanese scout aircraft or an attack on one of the Japanese surface forces, Nagumo&#x27;s carriers would immediately launch a strike force to destroy them. With the U.S. carriers destroyed or disabled, Abe&#x27;s &quot;vanguard&quot; and Kondo&#x27;s &quot;advanced&quot; forces would close with and destroy the remaining Allied naval forces in a warship surface action. This would then allow Japanese naval forces the freedom to neutralize Henderson Field through bombardment while covering the landing of the Japanese army troops to retake Guadalcanal and Tulagi.

In response to an unanticipated land battle fought between U.S. Marines and Japanese forces on Guadalcanal on 19–20 August, the U.S. carrier task forces under Fletcher reversed towards Guadalcanal from their positions to the south on 21 August. The U.S. carriers were to support the Marines, protect Henderson Field, engage the enemy and destroy any Japanese naval forces that arrived to support Japanese troops in the land battle on Guadalcanal.
Both Allied and Japanese naval forces continued to converge on 22 August, and both sides conducted intense aircraft scouting efforts, but neither side spotted its adversary. At least one Japanese scouting aircraft was shot down by aircraft from &quot;Enterprise&quot; before it could send a radio report, and this caused the Japanese to strongly suspect that U.S. carriers were in the immediate area. The U.S. forces were unaware of the disposition and strength of the approaching Japanese surface warship forces.

At 09:50 on 23 August, a U.S. PBY Catalina flying boat operating out of Ndeni in the Santa Cruz Islands initially sighted Tanaka&#x27;s convoy. By late afternoon, with no further sightings of Japanese ships, two aircraft strike forces from &quot;Saratoga&quot; and Henderson Field took off to attack the convoy. Tanaka, knowing that an attack would be forthcoming following the PBY sighting, reversed course once it had departed the area and eluded the strike aircraft. After Tanaka reported to his superiors his loss of time by turning north to avoid the expected Allied airstrike, the landings of his troops on Guadalcanal was pushed back to 25 August. By 18:23 on 23 August, with no Japanese carriers sighted and no new intelligence reporting of their presence in the area, Fletcher detached &quot;Wasp&quot;, which was getting low on fuel, and the rest of TF 18 for the two-day trip south toward Efate Island to refuel. Thus, &quot;Wasp&quot; and her escorting warships missed the upcoming battle.

===Carrier action on 24 August===
At 01:45 on 24 August, Nagumo ordered Rear Admiral Chūichi Hara, commanding the light carrier &quot;Ryūjō&quot;, the heavy cruiser and the destroyers and , to proceed ahead of the main Japanese force and send an aircraft attack force against Henderson Field at daybreak. The &quot;Ryūjō&quot; mission was most likely in response to a request from the naval commander at Rabaul, Nishizō Tsukahara, for help from the combined fleet in neutralizing Henderson Field. The mission may also have been intended by Nagumo as a feint maneuver to divert U.S. attention, allowing the rest of the Japanese force to approach the U.S. naval forces undetected, as well as to help provide protection and cover for Tanaka&#x27;s convoy. Most of the aircraft on &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot; were readied to launch on short notice if the U.S. carriers were located. Between 05:55 and 06:30, the U.S. carriers, mainly &quot;Enterprise&quot;, augmented by PBY Catalinas from Ndeni, launched their own scout aircraft to search for the Japanese naval forces.

At 09:35, a Catalina made the first sighting of the &quot;Ryūjō&quot; force. Later that morning, several more sightings by carrier and other U.S. reconnaissance aircraft followed, including &quot;Ryūjō&quot; and ships of Kondo&#x27;s and Mikawa&#x27;s forces. Throughout the morning and early afternoon, U.S. aircraft also sighted several Japanese scout aircraft and submarines, leading Fletcher to believe that the Japanese knew where his carriers were, which actually was not yet the case. Still, Fletcher hesitated to order a strike against the &quot;Ryūjō&quot; group until he was sure there were no other Japanese carriers in the area. Finally, with no firm word on the presence or location of other Japanese carriers, at 13:40 Fletcher launched a strike of 38 aircraft from &quot;Saratoga&quot; to attack &quot;Ryūjō&quot;. He kept aircraft in reserve on both U.S. carriers in case any Japanese fleet carriers were sighted.

Meanwhile, at 12:20, &quot;Ryūjō&quot; launched six Nakajima B5N2 bombers and 15 A6M3 Zero fighters to attack Henderson Field in conjunction with an attack by 24 Mitsubishi G4M2 bombers and 14 Zero fighters from Rabaul. Unknown to the &quot;Ryūjō&quot; aircraft, the Rabaul aircraft had encountered severe weather and returned to their base at 11:30. The &quot;Ryūjō&quot; aircraft were detected on radar by &quot;Saratoga&quot; as they flew toward Guadalcanal, further fixing the location of their ship for the impending U.S. attack. The &quot;Ryūjō&quot; aircraft arrived over Henderson Field at 14:23 and tangled with the Cactus Air Force based at Henderson while they bombed the airfield. In the resulting engagement, three B5N level bombers, three Zeros, and three U.S. fighters were shot down, and no significant damage was done to Henderson Field.
Almost simultaneously, at 14:25 a Japanese scout aircraft from the cruiser sighted the U.S. carriers. Although the aircraft was shot down, its report was transmitted in time, and Nagumo immediately ordered his strike force launched from &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot;. The first wave of aircraft, consisting of 27 Aichi D3A2 dive bombers and 15 Zeros under the command of Lieutenant Commander Mamoru Seki, was in the air by 14:50 and on its way toward &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot;. About this same time, two U.S. scout aircraft finally sighted the main Japanese force, but because of communication problems these sighting reports never reached Fletcher. Before leaving the area, the two U.S. scout aircraft attacked &quot;Shōkaku&quot;, causing negligible damage but forcing five of the first-wave Zeros to give chase, thus aborting their mission. At 16:00 a second wave of 9 Zeros and 27 D3A dive bombers, under the command of Lieutenant Sadamu Takahashi, was launched by the Japanese carriers and headed south toward the U.S. carriers. Abe&#x27;s &quot;Vanguard&quot; force also surged ahead in anticipation of meeting the U.S. ships in a surface action after nightfall.

Also at this time, the &quot;Saratoga&quot; strike force arrived and attacked &quot;Ryūjō&quot;, hitting and heavily damaging her with three to five bombs and perhaps one torpedo, and killing 120 of her crew. Also during this time, several U.S. B-17 heavy bombers attacked the crippled &quot;Ryūjō&quot; but caused no additional damage. The crew abandoned the heavily damaged Japanese carrier at nightfall, and she sank soon after. &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; and &quot;Tokitsukaze&quot; rescued &quot;Ryūjō&quot;″s survivors and the aircrews from her returning strike force, who ditched their aircraft in the ocean nearby. After the rescue operations were complete, both Japanese destroyers and &quot;Tone&quot; rejoined Nagumo&#x27;s main force.

At 16:02, still waiting for a definitive report on the location of the Japanese fleet carriers, the U.S. carriers&#x27; radar detected the first incoming wave of Japanese strike aircraft. Fifty-three F4F-4 Wildcat fighters from the two U.S. carriers were directed by radar control towards the attackers. Communication problems, limitations of the aircraft identification capabilities of the radar, primitive control procedures, and effective screening of the Japanese dive bombers by their escorting Zeros, prevented all but a few of the U.S. fighters from engaging the D3A dive bombers before they began their attacks on the U.S. carriers. Just before the Japanese dive bombers began their attacks, &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot; cleared their decks for the impending action by launching the aircraft that they had been holding ready in case the Japanese fleet carriers were sighted. These aircraft were told to fly north and attack anything they could find, or else to circle outside the battle zone, until it was safe to return.
At 16:29, the Japanese dive bombers began their attacks. Although several attempted to set up to attack &quot;Saratoga&quot;, they quickly shifted back to the nearer carrier, &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Thus, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was the target of almost the entire Japanese air attack. In a desperate attempt to disrupt their attacks, several Wildcats followed the D3A dive bombers into their attack dives, despite the intense anti-aircraft artillery fire from &quot;Enterprise&quot; and her screening warships. As many as four Wildcats were shot down by U.S. anti-aircraft fire, as well as several D3A dive bombers.

Because of the effective anti-aircraft fire from the U.S. ships, plus evasive maneuvers, the bombs from the first nine D3A dive bombers missed &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The second division, which was led by Lieutenant Keiichi Arima, managed to score three hits. Initially, the lead D3A dive bomber, piloted by Petty Officer Kiyoto Furuta, scored a hit with a  semi-armor-piercing, delayed-action &quot;ordinary&quot; bomb that penetrated the flight deck near the aft elevator and passed through three decks before detonating below the waterline, killing 35 men and wounding 70 more. Incoming seawater caused &quot;Enterprise&quot; to develop a slight list, but it was not a major breach of hull integrity.

Just 30 seconds later, the next D3A dive bomber, piloted by Petty Officer Tamotsu Akimoto, planted its  high-explosive &quot;land&quot; bomb only away from where the first bomb hit. The resulting detonation ignited a large secondary explosion from one of the nearby guns&#x27; ready powder casings, killing 35 members of the nearby gun crews and starting a large fire.
About a minute later, at 16:46, a third and last bomb (also a &quot;land&quot; bomb), dropped by Petty Officer Kazumi Horie, hit &quot;Enterprise&quot; on the flight deck forward of where the first two bombs hit. This bomb exploded on contact, creating a hole in the deck but causing no further damage. Seven D3A dive bombers—three from &quot;Shokaku&quot; and four from &quot;Zuikaku&quot;—then broke off from the attack on &quot;Enterprise&quot; to attack the battleship USS &quot;North Carolina&quot;, but all were shot down by anti-aircraft fire or U.S. fighters. The attack was over at 16:48, and the surviving Japanese aircraft reassembled in small groups and returned to their ships.

Both sides thought that they had inflicted more damage than was the case. The U.S. claimed to have shot down 70 Japanese aircraft, even though there were only 37 aircraft in all. Actual Japanese losses—from all causes—in the engagement were 25 aircraft, with most of the crews of the lost aircraft not being recovered or rescued. The Japanese, for their part, mistakenly believed that they had heavily damaged two U.S. carriers, instead of just one. The U.S. lost six aircraft in the engagement, along with five pilots.

Although &quot;Enterprise&quot; was heavily damaged and on fire, her damage-control teams were able to make sufficient repairs for the ship to resume flight operations at 17:46, only one hour after the engagement ended. At 18:05, the &quot;Saratoga&quot; strike force returned from sinking &quot;Ryūjō&quot; and landed without major incident. The second wave of Japanese aircraft approached the U.S. carriers at 18:15 but was unable to locate the U.S. formation because of communication problems and had to return to their carriers without attacking any U.S. ships. It lost five aircraft from operational mishaps. Most of the U.S. carrier aircraft launched just before the first wave of Japanese aircraft attacked failed to find any targets, but two SBD Dauntlesses from &quot;Saratoga&quot; sighted Kondo&#x27;s advanced force and attacked the seaplane tender &quot;Chitose&quot;, scoring two near-misses which heavily damaged the unarmored ship. The U.S. carrier aircraft either landed at Henderson Field or were able to return to their carriers after dusk. The U.S. ships retired to the south to get out of range of any approaching Japanese warships. In fact, Abe&#x27;s &quot;vanguard force&quot; and Kondō&#x27;s &quot;advanced force&quot; were steaming south to try to catch the U.S. carrier task forces in a surface battle, but they turned around at midnight without having made contact with the U.S. warships. Nagumo&#x27;s main body, having taken heavy aircraft losses in the engagement and being low on fuel, also retreated northward.

===Actions on 25 August===
Believing that two U.S. carriers had been taken out of action with heavy damage, Tanaka&#x27;s reinforcement convoy again headed toward Guadalcanal, and by 08:00 on 25 August they were within of their destination. At this time, Tanaka&#x27;s convoy was joined by five destroyers(&quot;Mutsuki&quot;-class destroyers and , &quot;Kagerou&quot;-class destroyers and , and &quot;Shiratsuyu&quot;-class destroyer ) which had shelled Henderson Field the night before, causing slight damage. At 08:05, 18 U.S. aircraft from Henderson Field attacked Tanaka&#x27;s convoy, causing heavy damage to &quot;Jintsu&quot;, killing 24 crewmen, and knocking Tanaka unconscious. The troop transport &quot;Kinryu Maru&quot; was also hit and eventually sank. Just as the destroyer pulled alongside &quot;Kinryu Maru&quot; to rescue her crew and embarked troops, she was attacked by four U.S. B-17s from Espiritu Santo, which landed five bombs on or around &quot;Mutsuki&quot;, sinking her immediately. An uninjured but shaken Tanaka transferred to the destroyer , sent &quot;Jintsu&quot; back to Truk, and took the convoy to the Japanese base in the Shortland Islands.

Both the Japanese and the U.S. elected to completely withdraw their warships from the area, ending the battle. The Japanese naval forces lingered near the northern Solomons, out of range of the U.S. aircraft based at Henderson Field, before finally returning to Truk on 5 September.

==Aftermath==
The battle is generally considered to be a tactical and strategic victory for the U.S. because the Japanese lost more ships, aircraft, and aircrew, and Japanese troop reinforcements for Guadalcanal were delayed. Summing up the significance of the battle, historian Richard B. Frank states:

The Battle of the Eastern Solomons was unquestionably an American victory, but it had little long-term result, apart from a further reduction in the corps of trained Japanese carrier aviators. The [Japanese] reinforcements that could not come by slow transport would soon reach Guadalcanal by other means.

The U.S. lost only seven aircrew in the battle. The Japanese lost 61 veteran aircrew, who were difficult for the Japanese to replace because of an institutionalized limited capacity in their naval aircrew training programs and an absence of trained reserves. The troops in Tanaka&#x27;s convoy were later loaded onto destroyers at the Shortland Islands and delivered piecemeal to Guadalcanal without most of their heavy equipment, beginning on 29 August. The Japanese claimed considerably more damage than they had inflicted, including that —not in the battle—had been sunk, thus avenging her part in the Doolittle Raid.

Emphasizing the strategic value of Henderson Field, in a separate reinforcement effort, the Japanese destroyer was sunk and two other Japanese destroyers heavily damaged on 28 August, north of Guadalcanal in New Georgia Sound by U.S. aircraft based at the airfield.

The damaged &quot;Enterprise&quot; traveled to Pearl Harbor for extensive repairs, which were completed on 15 October. She returned to the South Pacific on 24 October, just in time for the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands and her rematch with &quot;Shōkaku&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot;.

<text>The Huntington Library, Art Museum and Botanical Gardens, known as The Huntington, is a collections-based educational and research institution established by Henry E. Huntington and Arabella Huntington in San Marino, California, United States. In addition to the library, the institution houses an extensive art collection with a focus on 18th and 19th century European art and 17th to mid-20th century American art. The property also has approximately of specialized botanical landscaped gardens, including the &quot;Japanese Garden&quot;, the &quot;Desert Garden&quot;, and the &quot;Chinese Garden&quot;.

==History==

As a landowner, Henry Edwards Huntington (1850–1927) played a major role in the growth of Southern California. Huntington was born in 1850, in Oneonta, New York, and was the nephew and heir of Collis P. Huntington (1821–1900), one of the famous &quot;Big Four&quot; railroad tycoons of nineteenth century California history. In 1892, Huntington relocated to San Francisco with his first wife, Mary Alice Prentice, and their four children. In 1902, he relocated from the financial and political center of Northern California, San Francisco, to the state&#x27;s newer southern major metropolis, Los Angeles. In 1903, he purchased the 600-acre &quot;San Marino Ranch&quot; from James DeBarth Shorb Jr (1870–1907) for $240,000. He later purchased other large tracts of land in the Pasadena and Los Angeles areas of Los Angeles County for urban and suburban development. He divorced Mary Alice Prentice in 1906. He was one of the founders of the City of San Marino which was incorporated on April 25, 1913. On July 16, 1913, he married his uncle&#x27;s widow, Arabella Huntington (1851–1924). As president of the Pacific Electric Railway Company, the regional streetcar and public transit system for the Los Angeles metropolitan area and southern California and also of the Los Angeles Railway Company, (later the Southern California Railway), he spearheaded urban and regional transportation efforts to link together far-flung communities, supporting growth of those communities as well as promoting commerce, recreation and tourism.

Huntington&#x27;s interest in art was influenced in large part by Arabella, and with art experts to guide him, he benefited from a post-World War I European market that was &quot;ready to sell almost anything&quot;. Before his death in 1927, Huntington amassed &quot;far and away the greatest group of eighteenth-century British portraits ever assembled by any one man&quot;. In accordance with Huntington&#x27;s will, the collection, then worth $50 million, was opened to the public in 1928.

On October 17, 1985, a fire erupted in an elevator shaft of the Huntington Art Gallery and destroyed Sir Joshua Reynolds&#x27;s 1777 portrait of Mrs. Edwin Lascelles. After a year-long, $1 million refurbishing project, the Huntington Gallery reopened in 1986, with its artworks cleaned of soot and stains. Most of the funds for the cleanup and refurbishing of the Georgian mansion and its artworks came from donations from the Michael J. Connell Foundation, corporations and individuals. Both the Federal art-supporting establishment of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities gave emergency grants, the former of $17,500 to &quot;support conservation and other related costs resulting from a serious fire at the Gallery of Art&quot;, and the latter of $30,000 to &quot;support the restoration of several fire-damaged works of art that depict the story of Western culture.&quot;

On September 5, 2019, The Huntington kicked off a year-long celebration of its centennial year with exhibitions, special programs, initiatives, a special Huntington 100th rose, and a float in the 2020 Rose Parade in nearby Pasadena, California.

With an endowment of more than $700 million (and half a billion dollars raised between 2001 and 2013), the Huntington is among the wealthiest cultural institutions in the United States. It has undertaken major restorations and construction including a $60 million education and visitors center opened in 2015. In 2022 The Huntington received 1,014,000 visitors and had 54,000 member households. It hosted 1,360 readers and 131 scholars to conduct research within the collections and served 15,994 students through programs, classes, and site visits.

==Library==

The library building was designed in 1920 by the southern California architect Myron Hunt in the Mediterranean Revival style. Hunt&#x27;s previous commissions for Mr. and Mrs. Huntington included the Huntington&#x27;s residence in San Marino in 1909, and the Huntington Hotel in 1914. The library contains a substantial collection of rare books and manuscripts, concentrated in the fields of British and American history, literature, art, and the history of science. Spanning from the 11th century to the present, the library&#x27;s holdings contain 7 million manuscript items, over 400,000 rare books, and over a million photographs, prints, and other ephemera. Highlights include one of eleven vellum copies of the Gutenberg Bible known to exist, the Ellesmere manuscript of Chaucer (ca. 1410), and letters and manuscripts by George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and Abraham Lincoln. It is the only library in the world with the first two quartos of &quot;Hamlet&quot;; it holds the manuscript of Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s autobiography, Isaac Newton&#x27;s personal copy of his &quot;Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; with annotations in Newton&#x27;s own hand, the first seven drafts of Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s &quot;Walden&quot;, John James Audubon&#x27;s &quot;Birds of America&quot;, and first editions and manuscripts from authors such as Charles Bukowski, Jack London, Alexander Pope, William Blake, Mark Twain, and William Wordsworth.

The library&#x27;s main exhibition hall showcases some of the most outstanding rare books and manuscripts in the collection, while the West Hall of the library hosts rotating exhibitions. The Dibner Hall of the History of Science is a permanent exhibition on the history of science with a focus on astronomy, natural history, medicine, and light.

With the 2006 acquisition of the Burndy Library, a collection of nearly 60,000 items, the Huntington became one of the top institutions in the world for the study of the history of science and technology.

On December 14, 2022, the library announced they had acquired the archive of American author Thomas Pynchon.

===Research===
Researchers over age 18 may use the Library&#x27;s reading rooms to consult the collection upon establishing a research need that requires the use of The Huntington&#x27;s collections, identifying specific materials, and presenting the required form(s) of identification at orientation. Through a rigorous peer-review program, the institution awards approximately 150 grants to scholars in the fields of history, literature, art, and the history of science, medicine, and technology. The Huntington also hosts numerous scholarly events, lectures, conferences, and workshops.

In September 1991, then-director William A. Moffett announced that the library&#x27;s photographic archive of the Dead Sea Scrolls would be available to all qualified scholars, not just those approved by the international team of editors that had so long limited access to a chosen few. The collection consists of 3,000 photographs of all the original scrolls.

Through a partnership with the University of Southern California, the library has established two research centers: the USC-Huntington Early Modern Studies Institute and the Huntington-USC Institute on California and the West.

==Art collections==
The Huntington&#x27;s collections are displayed in permanent installations housed in the Huntington Art Gallery and Virginia Steele Scott Gallery of American Art. Special temporary exhibitions are mounted in the MaryLou and George Boone Gallery, with smaller, focused exhibitions displayed in the Works on Paper Room in the Huntington Art Gallery and the Susan and Stephen Chandler Wing of the Scott Galleries. In addition the gallery also hosts different exhibitions of photography throughout the year including those about different social and political subjects.

===European art===

The European collection, consisting largely of 18th- and 19th-century British &amp; French paintings, sculptures and decorative arts, is housed in The Huntington Art Gallery, the original Huntington residence. The permanent installation also includes selections from the Arabella D. Huntington Memorial Art Collection, which contains Italian and Northern Renaissance paintings and a spectacular collection of 18th-century French tapestries, porcelain, and furniture. Some of the best known works in the European collection include &quot;The Blue Boy&quot; by Thomas Gainsborough, &quot;Pinkie&quot; by Thomas Lawrence, and &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; by Rogier van der Weyden.

===American art===
Complementing the European collections is the Huntington&#x27;s American art holdings, a collection of paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures, and photographs dating from the 17th to the mid-20th century. The institution did not begin collecting American art until 1979, when it received a gift of 50 paintings from the Virginia Steele Scott Foundation. Consequently, The Virginia Steele Scott Gallery of American Art was established in 1984. In 2009, the Virginia Steele Scott Galleries were expanded, refurbished, and reinstalled. The new showcase, a $1.6 million project designed to give the Huntington&#x27;s growing American art collection more space and visibility, combines the original, 1984 American gallery with the Lois and Robert F. Erburu Gallery, a modern classical addition designed by Los Angeles architect Frederick Fisher. Highlights among the American art collections include &quot;Breakfast in Bed&quot; by Mary Cassatt, &quot;The Long Leg&quot; by Edward Hopper, &quot;Small Crushed Campbell&#x27;s Soup Can (Beef Noodle)&quot; by Andy Warhol, and &quot;Global Loft (Spread)&quot; by Robert Rauschenberg. As of 2014, the collection numbers some 12,000 works, ninety percent of them drawings, photographs and prints.

In 2014, the library acquired the Millard Sheets mural &quot;Southern California landscape&quot; (1934), the dining room wall painting originally painted for homeowners Fred H. and Bessie Ranke in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles.

===Acquisitions===
In 1999, the Huntington acquired the collection of materials relating to Arts and Crafts artist and designer William Morris amassed by Sanford and Helen Berger, comprising stained glass, wallpaper, textiles, embroidery, drawings, ceramics, more than 2,000 books, original woodblock prints, and the complete archives of Morris&#x27;s decorative arts firm Morris &amp; Co. and its predecessor Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co. These materials formed the foundation for the 2002 exhibit &quot;William Morris: Creating the Useful and the Beautiful&quot;.

In 2005, actor Steve Martin gave $1 million to the Huntington to support exhibitions and acquisitions of American art, with three-quarters of the money to be spent on exhibitions and the rest on purchases of artworks. In 2009, Andy Warhol&#x27;s painting &quot;Small Crushed Campbell&#x27;s Soup Can (Beef Noodle)&quot; (1962) as well as group of the artist&#x27;s &quot;Brillo Boxes&quot; were donated by the estate of Robert Shapazian, the founding director of Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills. In 2011, a $1.75 million acquisition fund for post-1945 American art was established by unidentified patrons in honor of the late Shapazian. The first purchase from the fund was the painting &quot;Global Loft (Spread)&quot; (1979) by Robert Rauschenberg.

In 2012, the museum acquired its first major work by an African-American artist when it purchased a 22-foot-long carved redwood panel from 1937 by sculptor Sargent Claude Johnson.

In October 2023, the museum unveiled a 320-year-old, Japanese home once owned by a &quot;shōya&quot; (village head). From 2018 to 2023, craftspeople carefully disassembled the house, labeled, cleaned, and repaired each part, reassembled the house in a Japanese warehouse, refitted the house to US building codes, disassembled it again, and reassembled it in California. Curator Robert Hori likened the whole process to building a &quot;giant model airplane.&quot;

==Botanical gardens==
The Huntington&#x27;s botanical gardens cover and showcase plants from around the world. Huntington worked to make them thrive in the generous California climate. Today his many projects of horticulture live on, providing opportunities for botanical research and for enjoyment. The gardens are divided into more than a dozen themes, including the Australian Garden, Camellia Collection, Children&#x27;s Garden, Desert Garden, Herb Garden, Japanese Garden, Lily Ponds, North Vista, Palm Garden, Rose Garden, the Shakespeare Garden, Subtropical and Jungle Garden, and the Chinese Garden (Liu Fang Yuan 流芳園 or the Garden of Flowing Fragrance).

The Rose Hills Foundation Conservatory for Botanical Science has a large tropical plant collection, as well as a carnivorous plants wing. The Huntington has a program to protect and propagate endangered plant species. In 1999, 2002, 2009, 2010, 2014, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, specimens of &quot;Amorphophallus titanum&quot;, or the odiferous &quot;corpse flower&quot;, bloomed at the facility. There were a total of fourteen corpse flowers bloomed at Huntington since 1999. Three flowers opened in July 2021.
The Camellia Collection, recognized as an International Camellia Garden of Excellence, includes nearly eighty different camellia species and some 1,200 cultivated varieties, many of them rare and historic. The Rose Garden contains approximately 1,200 cultivars (4,000 individual plants) arranged historically to trace the development of roses from ancient to modern times.

===Chinese Garden===

A Chinese garden, the largest outside of China, was dedicated on February 26, 2008, after artisans from Suzhou, China spent some six months at Huntington to construct the first phase of the newest facility. On at the northwest corner of the Huntington, the garden features man-made lakes (&quot;Pond of Reflected Greenery&quot; and &quot;Lake of Reflected Fragrance&quot;) with pavilions connected by bridges. Unique Chinese names are assigned to many of the facilities in the garden, such as the tea house, known as the &quot;Hall of the Jade Camellia&quot;. Other pavilions are the &quot;Love for the Lotus Pavilion&quot;, &quot;Terrace of the Jade Mirror&quot;, and &quot;Pavilion of the Three Friends&quot;. The initial phase cost $18.3 million to build.

The second phase, which includes the &quot;Clear and Transcendent Pavilion&quot;, &quot;Lingering Clouds Peak&quot; with a waterfall, Waveless Boat, &quot;Crossing through Fragrance&quot; bridge and the &quot;Cloud Steps&quot; bridge, opened on March 8, 2014. There were other pavilions, including the &quot;Flowery Brush Studio&quot;, and structures completed under phase two. A place to display its large collections of penjing and bonsai has completed.

===Desert Garden===

The Desert Garden, one of the world&#x27;s largest and oldest outdoor collections of cacti and other succulents, contains plants from extreme environments, many of which were acquired by Henry E. Huntington and William Hertrich (the garden curator). One of the Huntington&#x27;s most botanically important gardens, the Desert Garden brings together a plant group largely unknown and unappreciated in the beginning of the 1900s. Containing a broad category of xerophytes (aridity-adapted plants), the Desert Garden grew to preeminence and remains today among the world&#x27;s finest, with more than 5,000 species.

===Japanese Garden===
In 1911, art dealer George Turner Marsh (who also created the Japanese Tea Garden at the Golden Gate Park) sold his commercial Japanese tea garden to Henry E. Huntington to create the foundations of what is known today as the Japanese Garden. The garden was completed in 1912 and opened to the public in 1928. According to historian Kendall Brown, the garden consists of three gardens: the original stroll garden with koi-filled ponds and a drum or moon bridge, the raked-gravel dry garden added in 1968, and the traditionally landscaped tea garden.

In addition, the gardens feature a large bell, the authentic ceremonial teahouse Seifu-an (the Arbor of Pure Breeze), a fully furnished Japanese house, the Zen Garden, and the bonsai collections with hundreds of trees. The Bonsai Courts at the Huntington is the home of the Golden State Bonsai Federation Southern Collection. Another ancient Japanese art form can be found at the Harry Hirao Suiseki Court, where visitors can touch the suiseki or viewing stones.

<text>Ebenezer Learned (April 18, 1728 – April 1, 1801) was a brigadier general in the American Continental Army during the Revolutionary War.

==Early life and career==
He was the son of Ebenezer and Deborah Haynes Learned, and was born at Oxford, Massachusetts, and lived his entire life in the area. On October 5, 1749, he married Jerusha Baker (1732–1799) and they had nine children. When his grandfather died in 1750, he inherited 200 acres (0.8 km2) known as &quot;Prospect Hill&quot;, and built his home there.

Learned was an active member of the local militia, and raised and drilled a company at Oxford during the French and Indian War. In the summer of 1756 he led his company to Fort Edward at Lake George. There is little record of his service, except that he served sporadically from then until 1763. He fell ill with smallpox in 1757 and was hospitalized for a month.

After that war, he remained at home for several years, farming and operating a tavern at Oxford. He was prominent in both church and community, and served as a town selectman for 25 of the years between 1758 and 1794.

==American Revolution==
He remained active in the militia, and led his own and a neighboring company of minutemen to Boston, where he received the news of the Battle of Lexington on April 19, 1775. On April 24, the Massachusetts committee of safety named him a colonel and authorized him to organize a regiment that was known as Learned&#x27;s Regiment. His regiment was adopted into the Continental Army in June. In 1776 those who re-enlisted were augmented by men from Danielson&#x27;s Regiment to form the 3rd Continental Regiment.

By the end of the Siege of Boston, General Washington had given Learned command of the important Dorchester Heights position. When the British evacuated Boston on March 17, 1776, Colonel Learned was the first to enter the city. He led a battalion of 500 specially selected men, to clean out the traps, abatis, caltrops, and garbage left by the British. He and the men were selected because they had all had survived smallpox or had been inoculated.

Learned resigned in May 1776 due to ill health, but returned to duty on April 2, 1777. He was named a brigadier general and assigned to the Northern Department. In the first phase of the Battle of Saratoga, the Battle of Freeman&#x27;s Farm, his brigade was not very effective. Working forward in the center of the line, they mainly got lost in the woods, and exchanged light fire near the end of the battle.

At the Battle of Bemis Heights his brigade was in the center of the left division, fighting alongside Daniel Morgan and Enoch Poor. They were commanded by General Benjamin Lincoln. Learned&#x27;s own brigade (the 2nd, 8th, and 9th Massachusetts line), was expanded by James Livingston&#x27;s 1st Canadian Regiment and 2 regiments of New Hampshire Militia the 2nd and 4th. The attack on the American far left was turned by Daniel Morgan&#x27;s men, but the enemy&#x27;s center was held by Hessian troops. Benedict Arnold came onto the field and encouraged the men. Arnold and Learned led a joint charge on the Hessian positions, and, even though Arnold fell wounded, Learned and his men carried through and broke the enemy lines. Burgoyne&#x27;s forces had to retreat to their starting fortifications around Freeman&#x27;s Farm. When their charge carried the first bunker, Burgoyne&#x27;s forces withdrew to the positions they had held before the Freeman&#x27;s Farm battle.

After Saratoga, his was the first unit to guard and escort the surrendered Convention Army on its trek to the south. In 1777–78, he commanded a brigade of Massachusetts troops in Major General deKalb&#x27;s division at Valley Forge. On March 24, 1778, his continuing health problems led to his final resignation.

==Later life and activities==
Ebenezer returned home to Oxford. He served as the Chairman of the Massachusetts Convention of 1779 that adopted a new constitution for the state. He served as a Judge of Common Pleas for Worcester County, Massachusetts. In 1783 he was elected to the Massachusetts General Court (the state&#x27;s House of Representatives).

He died at home in Oxford in 1801.

<text>Sir David Lyndsay of the Mount (c. 1486 – c. 1555; surname sometimes transcribed as Lindsay) was a Scottish knight, poet, and herald who gained the highest heraldic office of Lyon King of Arms. He remains a well regarded poet whose works reflect the spirit of the Renaissance, specifically as a makar.

==Biography==

He was the son of David Lyndsay – second of the Mount (Fife), and of Garmylton (Haddingtonshire) – who died &quot;circa&quot; 1503. Lyndsay the younger&#x27;s place of birth and early education are unknown, but he may have attended the University of St Andrews, on the books of which appears an entry &quot;Da Lindesay&quot; for the session 1508–1509. He was engaged as a courtier in the Royal Household; first as an equerry, then as an usher (assistant to a head-tutor) to the future King James V of Scotland. His poems mention that he was involved in the education of James V and some contain advice for the young king.

The Treasurer&#x27;s Accounts are missing from September 1518 to June 1522. When they recommence, they record a &quot;Jenet Dowglas, spous to David Lindsay maister Ischare to the King&quot; who was a seamstress at court. Thus, it may be inferred that Lyndsay married, in or around 1522,
Janet Douglas, a court seamstress.

His first heraldic appointment was as Snowdon Herald and in 1529 he was appointed Lord Lyon King of Arms, and knighted. (Some sources cite 1542 as the year of his knighthood.) He was engaged in diplomatic business (twice abroad in the Netherlands and France), and was, in virtue of his heraldic office, a general master of ceremonies. He was involved in organising the ceremonies and celebrations welcoming the French brides of James V, Madeleine of Valois in 1537, and Mary of Guise in 1539.

Lyndsay signed the only surviving letter from this time, &quot;Dauid Lyndsay&quot;. His handwriting shows no trace of the italic forms used by those Scots who had finished their education abroad.

After the death of James V, in 1542, Lyndsay continued to sit in Parliament of Scotland as commissioner for Cupar, Fife. In 1548, he was member of a mission to Denmark which obtained certain privileges for Scottish merchants. There is reason to believe that he died in or about 1555.

In 1542, he produced a Scottish roll of arms known today as the &quot;Lindsay of the Mount Roll&quot;. It contains 400 Scottish coats of arms, some of which were added later in the 16th century, and forms the basis of the official Scots heraldic registry in use today. A facsimile comprising accurate redrawing of his own drawings was published in Edinburgh in 1878.

==Literary works==

Most of Lyndsay&#x27;s literary work, by which he secured great reputation in his own day and by which he still lives, was written during the period of prosperity at court. In this respect he is different from Gavin Douglas, who abandoned literature to become a politician. The difference is due partly to the fact that Lyndsay&#x27;s muse was more occasional and satirical, and that the time was suitable to the exercise of his special gifts. It is more difficult to explain how he enjoyed such unparalleled freedom of speech. He chastised all classes, from his royal master to the most simple. There is no evidence that he abjured Catholicism; yet his leading purpose was the exposure of its errors and abuses. His aid was readily accepted by the reforming party, and by their use of his work he shared with their leaders throughout many generations.

Lyndsay, the Makar, is not behind his fellow-poets in acknowledgment to Geoffrey Chaucer. As piously as they, he reproduces the master&#x27;s forms; but in him the sentiment and outlook have suffered change. His nearest approach to Chaucer is in &quot;The Historie and Testament of Squyer Meldrum&quot;, which recalls the sketch of the &quot;young squire&quot;; but the reminiscence is verbal rather than spiritual. Elsewhere his memory serves him less happily, as when he describes the array of the lamented Queen Magdalene in the words which Chaucer had applied to the eyes of his wanton Friar. So too, in the &quot;Dreme&quot;, the allegorical tradition survives only in the form. &quot;Remembrance&quot; conducts the poet over the old-world itinerary, but only to lead him to speculation on Scotland&#x27;s woes and to an &quot;Exhortatioun to the Kingis Grace&quot; to bring relief. The tenor is well expressed in the motto from the Vulgate – &quot;&quot;Prophetias nolite spernere. Omnia autem probate: quod bonum est tenete&quot;.&quot;

This didactic habit is freely exercised in the long poem (sometimes called the &quot;Monarchie&quot;), a universal history of the medieval type, in which the falls of princes by corruption supply an object lesson to the unreformed church of his day. &quot;Ane Pleasant Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis&quot; is more direct in its attack on ecclesiastical abuse; and its dramatic form permits more lively treatment. This piece is of great historical interest, being the only extant example of a complete Scottish morality. It is in respect of literary quality Lyndsay&#x27;s best work, and in dramatic construction and delineation of character it holds a high place in this genre. The farcical interludes (in places too coarse for modern taste) supply many touches of genuine comedy; and throughout the play there are passages, as in the speeches of &quot;Veritie in the First Part&quot; and of &quot;Dame Chastitie&quot; in the &quot;Interlude of the Sowtar and the Taylor,&quot; in which word and line are happily conceived.

&quot;The Testament of the Papyngo&quot; (parrot), drawn in the familiar medieval manner, is another tract for the time, full of admonition to court and clergy. Of his shorter pieces, &quot;&quot;, and the &quot;Answer to the Kingis Flyting&quot; have a like pulpit resonance. The former is interesting as a forerunner of Burns&#x27;s device in the &quot;Twa Dogs&quot;.

&quot;The Deploratioun of the Death of Queen Magdalene&quot; is in the extravagant style of commemoration illustrated in Dunbar&#x27;s &quot;Elegy on the Lord Aubigny&quot;. &quot;&quot; is a contribution to the popular taste for boisterous fun, in spirit, if not in form, akin to the &quot;Christis Kirk on the Grene&quot; series; and indirectly, with Dunbar&#x27;s &quot;Turnament&quot; and &quot;Of ane Blak-Moir&quot;, a burlesque of the courtly tourney. Lyndsay approaches Dunbar in his satire (&quot;wide&quot; trains of the ladies), which recalls the older poet&#x27;s realistic lines on the filthy condition of the city streets. In Lyndsay&#x27;s &quot;Descriptioun of Pedder Coffeis&quot; (pedlars) we have an early example of the studies in vulgar life which are so plentiful in later Scottish literature. In &quot;Kitteis Confessioun&quot; he returns, but in more sprightly mood, to his attack on the church.

==Critical literature==
A complete edition of Lyndsay&#x27;s poetical works was published by David Laing in 3 vols. in 1879. The E.E.T.S. issued the first part of a complete edition in 1865 (ed. F. Hall). Five parts have appeared, four edited by F. Hall, the fifth by J.A.H. Murray. For the bibliography see Laing&#x27;s 3 vol. edition, u.s. iii. pp. 222 et seq., and the E.E.T.S. edition passim. The Association for Scottish Literary Studies issued Janet Hadley Williams, &quot;David Lyndsay, Selected Poems&quot;, (2000) freshly establishing texts with detailed notes. See also the editions by Pinkerton (1792), Sibbald (1803), and George Chalmers (1806); and the critical accounts in Henderson&#x27;s &quot;Scottish Vernacular Literature&quot; (1898), Gregory Smith&#x27;s &quot;Transition Period&quot; (1900), and J.H. Millar&#x27;s &quot;Literary History of Scotland&quot; (1903).

A professional work prepared by Lyndsay in the Lyon Office, entitled the &quot;Register of Scottish Arms&quot; (now preserved in manuscript in the Advocates&#x27; Library), was printed in 1821 and reprinted in 1878. It remains the most authoritative document on Scottish heraldry. The Rothesay Herald offered to show the Armorial to the English diplomat Thomas Randolph in October 1561, &quot;wherein are all the arms of all the noblemen and barons both new and old that are in Scotland.&quot;

==Diplomatic duties==
===Mission of June 1531===
As Snowdon Herald, Lyndsay was sent to the Emperor Charles V at the end of June 1531. He was to conclude their Treaty of Perpetual Peace for a duration of 100 years. This would succeed a treaty made 100 years previously. Other business included the long-standing issue of Robert Barton of Over Barnton&#x27;s ship the &quot;Black Bark&quot;, seized by Spanish pirates off England in 1519.

In his Latin letters to Charles V, James V refers to Lyndsay as &quot;chief herald&quot; or &quot;first of our order.&quot; Lyndsay stayed 7 weeks at court with the Emperor and Queen of Hungary at Brussels.

===Mission of March 1532===
Lyndsay was set to go to France as a herald accompanying Thomas Erskine of Haltoun and the Bishop of Ross in January 1532. This Scottish embassy was delayed till March 1532. The ambassadors were to contract with Francis I of France the marriage of James V to Madeleine of Valois.

===England 1535===
Lyndsay as Lion King of Arms accompanied Lord Erskine with Robert Hart, Rothesay Herald, to Windsor Castle, where they acted as proxy for the installation of James V as a Knight of the Order of the Garter. After travelling to meet Henry VIII at Thornbury Castle, they returned to London, where a servant of Thomas Cromwell gave Lindsay £20.

===Edinburgh 1540===
Lyndsay conducted the visit of the English ambassador Ralph Sadler at Holyroodhouse in February 1540 with his assistant Rothesay Herald. They met Sadler, and brought him to James V at the Chapel Royal in the Palace then returned him to his lodgings and dined with him. Later, Lindsay arranged Sadler&#x27;s meeting with Margaret Tudor, and brought him to meet her again in Chapel on the following Sunday.

===England 1543===
After the death of James V, Lyndsay was sent by Regent Arran to England to return the late King&#x27;s collar, garter, and statutes of the Order of the Garter to Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, the prelate of the Order. Henry VIII wrote to Arran that Lindsay had fulfilled his office &quot;right discreetly.&quot;

==Other literature==

Lyndsay of the Mount appears as the sympathetic major character in Nigel Tranter&#x27;s well-researched James V trilogy: &quot;The Riven Realm&quot; (1984), &quot;James by the Grace of God&quot; (1985), and &quot;Rough Wooing&quot; (1987).

Lyndsay&#x27;s description of the Tower of Babel in his &quot;Dialog&quot; (&quot;The shadow of that hyddeous strength [the Tower of Babel], sax myle and more it is of length&quot;) is used as the motto of the novel &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot; by C. S. Lewis, and the book&#x27;s name is also derived from it.

Lyndsay appears as a character in Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Marmion&quot;. He is depicted amongst the sixteen Scottish writers and poets on the lower section of the Scott Monument on Princes Street in Edinburgh. He is shown on the left side of the southern face.

Lyndsay of the Mount is a major character in John Arden&#x27;s play &quot;Armstrong&#x27;s Last Goodnight&quot; set in 16th-century Scotland.

<doc id="261104" wikidata="Q1972477" url="?curid=261104" title="Charles Upham">
<text>Captain Charles Hazlitt Upham (21 September 1908 – 22 November 1994) was a New Zealand soldier decorated for actions during World War II.

Born in Christchurch, New Zealand, he attended Christ&#x27;s College and later the Canterbury Agricultural College, where he earned a diploma in agriculture. Before the outbreak of the war, Upham worked as a sheep farmer and a manager of a high country station and later at the Government Valuation Department. In 1939, with the advent of World War II, he enlisted in the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force, where he quickly rose through the ranks.

Upham&#x27;s first Victoria Cross was awarded for his actions in the Battle of Crete in May 1941, where he displayed remarkable courage and leadership under fire. Despite being wounded, he led multiple attacks against enemy positions and helped evacuate wounded soldiers. His second Victoria Cross came from his actions during the First Battle of El Alamein in July 1942, where once again he demonstrated bravery and resilience in the face of intense enemy fire, despite being severely wounded. Upham is one of three people to be awarded a Victoria Cross twice and the only fighting combatant to do so, the others being medical staff Arthur Martin-Leake and Noel Godfrey Chavasse.

After the war, Upham returned to New Zealand, where he continued to farm and became involved in veterans&#x27; affairs. He famously rejected offers of financial assistance, preferring to live a quiet life dedicated to his family and community. He died on 22 November 1994 at the age of 86. His funeral in the Christchurch Cathedral was conducted with full military honours; and he was buried in the graveyard of St Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church.

==Early life==
Upham was born in Christchurch on 21 September 1908, the son of John Hazlitt Upham, a lawyer, and his wife, Agatha Mary Coates. His father was a great-grandson of artist John Hazlitt, while his mother was a granddaughter of pioneer colonist Guise Brittan. He grew up a quiet, shy boy, very gentlemanly and courteous, and &quot;no trouble at all&quot;. He wasn&#x27;t a strong child physically, as well as having a slightly shorter leg than the other, leading to a doctor suspecting Upham of having a mild case of poliomyelitis. He boarded at Waihi School, near Winchester, South Canterbury, between 1917 and 1922 and boarded at Christ&#x27;s College, Christchurch, from 1923 to 1927.

Upham&#x27;s father was disappointed when his only son elected not to study law and join his father&#x27;s practice, Charles stating, &quot;I&#x27;d always be jealous of my friends on farms&quot;. So Upham&#x27;s father enrolled Charles at Canterbury Agricultural College (now known as Lincoln University), where the practical and theoretical sciences of farming are taught at the university level, joining in 1928.
Upham rapidly found himself enthralled with the work. He plunged into the farm and study courses with an enthusiasm that convinced his parents that, after all, it was the right choice. For two years he was first in agriculture and gained firsts also in veterinary science and economics. With a diploma of agriculture, Upham left Canterbury Agricultural College in 1930 to begin life on the land. For the next six years, he learnt his craft in the hills, gullies, and plains of Canterbury. He worked as shepherd, musterer and farm manager.

In 1935, at Riccarton Park Racecourse, he met Molly McTamney, who was a distant relative of Noel Godfrey Chavasse. She was a dietitian working at Christchurch Hospital, after four years of hospital nursing. She was described as &quot;brunette, pretty, and gay&quot;. They danced together that evening, and the next day Upham was waiting as she came off duty. He had an armful of red roses for her and he proposed marriage, but she declined, although they both continued in a relationship.

In March 1937, he joined the Government Valuation Department, firstly under supervision, then alone, where Upham quickly assimilated the techniques of land valuation. He was aided by the scientific knowledge gained at Canterbury Agricultural College, but much more by his extensive experience of Canterbury land during his six years&#x27; work in the province. The following year, he became engaged to McTamney. In February 1939, granted leave from the Valuation Department, Upham returned to Canterbury Agricultural College to take a course in valuation and farm management.

Now somewhat of an elder statesman, by virtue of his earlier days at the college and his wide farming experience, Upham became a popular favourite of his fellow students. He helped them liberally with their own studies, he played football with just as much vigour as before. The course he took was restricted to men of wide practical backgrounds and was designed primarily to train men for managerial posts in government departments. At the end of the year, he had no trouble with the necessary exams, obtaining his Diploma in Valuation and Farm Management. But the darkening months of 1939 saw Upham thinking more and more deeply about events on the other side of the world.

==Second World War==
With the call for volunteers in September 1939, after the outbreak of the Second World War, he enlisted in the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF) at the age of 30, and was posted to the 20th Canterbury-Otago Battalion, part of the New Zealand 2nd Division.

Although he already had five years&#x27; experience in the New Zealand Army Territorial Force, in which he held the rank of sergeant, he signed on as a private. He was soon promoted to temporary lance corporal, but initially declined a place in an Officer Cadet Training Unit (OCTU). In December, he was promoted to sergeant and six days later sailed for Egypt. 

In July 1940, Charles Upham was persuaded to attend the Officer Cadet Training Unit in Egypt. Successfully completing the course, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 2 November and given command of a platoon in 20th Battalion. Upham quickly won the respect of his men as a capable officer who was greatly concerned for their safety and comfort.

===Battle of Greece and Crete===
In March 1941, the New Zealand Expeditionary Force was deployed to Greece as part of the Allied attempt to counter the German-Italian invasion there. In a short-lived campaign, the Axis forces swept through Greece, resulting in 50,000 Allied troops having to be evacuated by the Royal Navy. Just over a third of their force was now deployed on the Greek island of Crete. The day after a German landing, Upham&#x27;s company were part of a counter-attack, the goal of which was to retake the airfield at Maleme. Upham led the 20th and the 28th (Māori) Battalion in an attack on several German machine gun posts. Advancing 3,000 yards under fire with no artillery support, Upham&#x27;s men took out the first machine gun using grenades and pistols. Upham himself then crept up to a house where another machine gun was based and tossed in some grenades to end their resistance. A further machine gun now opened up on the New Zealanders. Once more, their officer took it upon himself to crawl to within 15 yards of the Germans, lobbing some grenades into the enemy position. However, despite Upham&#x27;s successes, the Allied counter-attack failed due to German air superiority. They were forced to withdraw. As they retreated under German fire, Upham carried a wounded man back to safety and then encouraged several of his men to do likewise. While Upham got his platoon out, it now transpired that one company had not received the order to withdraw and was now isolated behind the advancing German lines. Upham, accompanied by a corporal, now ran 600 yards through the German lines, killing two Germans en route and successfully bringing the company back to safety.

The Allies fought a desperate retreat towards the south of the island in the hope of yet another evacuation. During the following two days his platoon occupied an exposed position on forward slopes and was continuously under fire. Upham was blown over by one mortar shell and painfully wounded by a piece of shrapnel behind the left shoulder by another. He disregarded the wound and remained on duty. He also received a bullet in the foot which he later removed in Egypt. On 25 May at Galatas, Upham&#x27;s platoon stopped under cover of a ridge, observed the enemy, and brought the platoon forward when the Germans advanced. They killed over forty with fire and grenades and forced the remainder to fall back.

Each time the Allies tried to hold a line, the Germans broke through. On one occasion, in this fast-moving situation, Upham left his platoon to retreat under his sergeant, while he went forward to warn another company that was about to be left behind. Suddenly he ran into two Germans who opened fire. Falling to the ground, Upham pretended to be dead. And while feigning death, he managed to rest his gun on the fork of a tree trunk and as the Germans came close, he opened fire, killing both of them. The second German was so close that as he fell, he fell onto the muzzle of Upham&#x27;s rifle.

On 30 May at Sfakia his platoon was ordered to deal with a party of the enemy which had advanced down a ravine near Force Headquarters. Though in an exhausted condition, he climbed the steep hill to the west of the ravine, placed his men in positions on the slope overlooking the ravine and himself went to the top with a Bren gun and two riflemen. By clever tactics, he induced the enemy party to expose itself and then at a range of 500 yards shot twenty-two and caused the remainder to disperse in panic. During the whole of the operations he suffered from diarrhoea and was able to eat very little, in addition to being wounded and bruised.

For his actions in the Battle of Crete, his commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Howard Kippenberger, recommended Upham for the Victoria Cross. Charles Upham was totally against the award, modestly feeling that it was undeserved. Eventually, his commanding officer convinced him that it was for his bravery and the service of the whole unit. He was gazetted for the VC in October 1941.

General Sir Claude Auchinleck presented Upham with his VC ribbon at a ceremonial parade by 4 Brigade on 4 November 1941.

===North African campaign===
In November 1941 he was annoyed when his commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel H. K. Kippenberger, decided to leave him out of the second Libyan campaign. Kippenberger believed that Upham &quot;was fretting for more action&quot; and &quot;would get himself killed too quickly&quot;. The battalion suffered heavy losses in the campaign and Upham helped rebuild it as commander of C Company. He was promoted to lieutenant at the time. Upham and the rest of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force now formed part of the British Eighth Army, based in Egypt. Upham would stay in the Eighth Army until the end of the war, first in North Africa. In late 1941 and early 1942, the Eighth Army were on the defensive, being pushed back by Erwin Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps.

In late June 1942, the New Zealanders were in danger of being completely cut off as Rommel swept into Egypt. On the night of 27 June, they desperately made a break for British lines. The ensuing battle saw Captain Upham&#x27;s company participate in fierce hand-to-hand fighting with the Germans. Upham was using grenades to lethal effect. In fact, he was throwing them at such short range that he was injured in both arms by shrapnel from his own grenades. The breakout was a success and the New Zealand Division was moved into the defensive line centred on the small railway town of El Alamein.

The New Zealanders were positioned to the south of the town and ordered to take the high ground at the El Ruasat Ridge. The attack began at 11 pm on 14 July. Along the ridge, they met fierce resistance from the Germans. Upham&#x27;s own company found themselves facing four machine gun nests and several tanks holding the high ground. Once more, Upham inspired his men to press home their attack. And once more, grenades were key to their assault. Upham was credited with personally destroying several machine gun posts and a tank as they stormed the ridge. In the process, he was shot in the elbow by one of the machine guns. Refusing to leave the battlefield, he got his wounds dressed as best they could at a regimental aid post and then he went back to his men.

The following day, the Germans and their Italian allies launched a ferocious counterattack, during which Upham was hit in the leg by shrapnel. Unable to move, he and the remaining six men of his company were captured, along with about a thousand fellow New Zealanders. He became a prisoner of war on 15 July 1942.

===Prisoner of war===
After being taken prisoner of war (POW), he was sent to an Italian hospital where an Italian doctor recommended his wounded arm be amputated, but Upham refused due to lack of anaesthesia, as he had seen other patients die as well as be in severe pain. He later had the wound dressed by an Allied POW doctor. After recovering enough to be moved, Upham was transferred to Campo P.G. 47 in Modena, Italy in March 1943. This camp, like many others, was harsh and strictly monitored. Upham made his first serious escape attempt here. His cell had one weakness – they had plaster board ceilings. Moving his bed vertically, he smashed it into the ceiling, but a secondary ceiling wired together prevented him from escaping. He was caught soon after.

In September 1943, following the Italian Armistice, many POWs in Italy were moved to German camps. While Upham was being transported in a truck, he jumped in a bend and managed to get 400 yards (370 m) away before being recaptured. He also broke his ankle in the process.
Upham arrived at Weinsberg Camp (Oflag Va). On one occasion, he tried to escape the camp by climbing its fences in broad daylight. He became entangled in barbed wire when he fell between the two fences. When a guard pointed a pistol at his head and threatened to shoot, Upham calmly ignored him and lit a cigarette. This scene was photographed by the Germans as evidence.

Due to his persistent escape attempts, Upham was eventually transferred to Oflag IV-C at Colditz Castle in late 1943, a fortress renowned for housing persistent and high-profile Allied escapees. On the trip to Colditz, Upham tried to escape while on a train. During his transfer on the civilian train, while guarded by two Germans, Upham made his final escape attempt. Upham was only allowed to visit the toilet when the train was travelling at high speed to prevent him from jumping through a window. Nevertheless, Upham prised open the toilet window and jumped onto the tracks, knocking himself unconscious. After awakening, he escaped into a nearby orchard, but the even rows of trees and lack of undergrowth provided poor cover and was soon recaptured.

As the war drew to a close in 1945, Colditz Castle was liberated by the advancing Allied forces. Upham, along with the other prisoners, was freed, bringing an end to his nearly three-year ordeal as a POW. He headed for the headquarters of the American unit that had captured the town. Upham selected the goods he had come for. He changed into the American combat uniform, fitted on the boots and the U.S. helmet. Then the arms – the Tommy gun, the revolver, two grenades, compass. He prepared to go into action with the Americans. For four days Charles stayed with the U.S. forces in the Colditz area, clothed and equipped as one of them, waiting for the call forward. The pressure of higher orders finally caught him up. &quot;Under no circumstances are released P.O.W.s to be permitted to join active service units, unofficially or otherwise. P.O.W.s are to be evacuated without exception.&quot; He could not beat that order, so reluctantly he left the Americans and was soon travelling to England.

In England, he was reunited with McTamney, who was then serving as a nurse. They were married at Barton on Sea, Hampshire, on 20 June 1945. He returned to New Zealand in early September, and she followed him in December.

===VC presentation===
King George VI invested Upham with his Victoria Cross at Buckingham Palace on 11 May 1945. In their exchange, King George said &quot;Well, Captain Upham, I believe this is not your only award. I&#x27;m told you&#x27;ve just received a mentioned in dispatches for your attempts to escape. Congratulations for that, too. Tell me, though, what have you been doing since you arrived in London?&quot;. &quot;Mostly eating, sir&quot; Upham replied. They later walked through St James&#x27;s Park together.

===Bar to VC===
When the recommendation was made for a second VC, the King said to Major-General Howard Kippenberger &quot;What do you think of Upham yourself? Does he deserve another VC?&quot; Kippenberger replied, &quot;I was his Brigadier in North Africa, sir. He did so many brave things, in my respectful opinion, Captain Upham won the VC several times over&quot;.

Colonel Burrows approached Kippenberger after the Minqar Qaim action and was already mooting the nomination for a second VC even before the battle at Ruweisat Ridge and Upham&#x27;s capture. General Lindsay Inglis received citations for both Minqar Qaim and Ruweisat that each individually suggested Upham merited the VC for either occasion independently, but because of the excessive rarity of multiple VC awards, he opted to combine the citations into a single one forwarded to the King.

Citation

With this award, Upham became the third man to be awarded a Bar to the VC. The previous recipients were Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Martin-Leake and Captain Noel Godfrey Chavasse, both doctors serving in the Royal Army Medical Corps. Martin-Leake received his VC for rescuing wounded under fire in the Second Boer War, and the Bar for similar actions in the First World War. Chavasse was similarly decorated for two such actions in the First World War, subsequently dying of wounds received during his second action. Neither of these men were combatants, so Upham remains the only fighting soldier to have been decorated with the VC and Bar.

==Post-war==
After the war, Upham returned to New Zealand, and the community raised £10,000 to buy him a farm. However, he declined and the money went into the C. H. Upham Scholarship for children of ex-servicemen to study at Canterbury Agricultural College or Canterbury College.

He obtained a war rehabilitation loan and bought a farm on Conway Flat, Hundalee, North Canterbury.

Although somewhat hampered by his injuries, he became a successful farmer and served on the board of governors of Christ&#x27;s College for nearly 20 years. He and Molly had three daughters, and lived on their farm until January 1994, when Upham&#x27;s poor health forced them to retire to Christchurch.

Upham was surprised with an appearance on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1985.
He died in Canterbury on 22November 1994, surrounded by his wife and daughters. His funeral in the Christ Church Cathedral was conducted with full military honours. The streets of Christchurch were lined by over 5,000 people. Upham is buried in the graveyard of St Paul&#x27;s Church in Papanui. His death was also marked by a memorial service on 5 May 1995 in London&#x27;s St Martin-in-the-Fields Church, attended by representatives for the Royal Family; senior New Zealand government and political figures; senior members of the British and New Zealand armed forces; Valerian Freyberg, 3rd Baron Freyberg, grandson of VC holder Lord Freyberg, the commander of Allied forces in Crete and 7th Governor-General of New Zealand; representatives of veterans&#x27; organisations; and other VC and George Cross holders.

==Victoria Cross and Bar==
In November 2006, Upham&#x27;s VC and Bar were purchased from his daughters by the Imperial War Museum for an undisclosed sum, however Minister of Defence at the time Phil Goff, announced a price of 3.3 million that the family had quoted the Government for a potential purchase of the medal. New Zealand legislation prohibits the export of such historical items, so the Imperial War Museum agreed to a permanent loan of the medals to the National Army Museum at Waiouru. On 2 December 2007, Upham&#x27;s VC was among nine stolen from locked, reinforced glass cabinets at the museum. On 16 February 2008, the New Zealand Police announced all the medals had been recovered as a result of a NZ$300,000 reward offered by Michael Ashcroft and Tom Sturgess.

==Legacy==

In 1953, Upham was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal. In 1992, he was presented with the Order of Honour by the Government of Greece, in recognition of his service in the Battles of Greece and Crete.

HMNZS &quot;Charles Upham&quot;, a Royal New Zealand Navy ship, was commissioned in 1995, and decommissioned in 2001.

A bronze statue stands outside the Hurunui District Council buildings in Amberley, North Canterbury, depicting Charles Upham &quot;the observer&quot;.

A street in suburban Christchurch is named Charles Upham Avenue, and there is an Upham Terrace in Palmerston North, and an Upham Crescent in Taradale, Napier. There is also an Upham Street in Havelock North, Hawke&#x27;s Bay, near streets named after fellow VC recipients Elliott, Grant, Crichton and Ngarimu.

A Jetconnect Boeing 737-800 was named &quot;Charles Upham&quot; in August 2011.

<text>Roadkill is a wild animal that has been killed by collision with motor vehicles. Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) have increasingly been the topic of academic research to understand the causes, and how they can be mitigated.

==History==

Essentially non-existent before the advent of mechanized transport, roadkill is associated with increasing automobile speed in the early 20th century. In 1920, naturalist Joseph Grinnell wrote of his observations in the state of California that &quot;this is a relatively new source of fatality; and if one were to estimate the entire mileage of such roads in the state, the mortality must mount into the hundreds and perhaps thousands every 24 hours.&quot;

In Europe and North America, deer are the animal most likely to cause vehicle damage.

==Causes==

The development of roads affects wildlife by altering and isolating habitat and populations, deterring the movement of wildlife, and resulting in extensive wildlife mortality. One writer states that &quot;our insulated industrialized culture keeps us disconnected from life beyond our windshields.&quot; Driving &quot;mindlessly&quot; without paying attention to the movements of others in the vehicle&#x27;s path, driving at speeds that do not allow stopping, and distractions contribute to the death toll. Moreover, a culture of indifference and hopelessness is created if people learn to ignore lifeless bodies on roads.

===Intentional collisions===
A study in Ontario, Canada in 1996 found many reptiles killed on portions of the road where vehicle tires do not usually pass over, which led to the inference that some drivers intentionally run over reptiles. To verify this hypothesis, research in 2007 found that 2.7% of drivers intentionally hit reptile decoys masquerading as snakes and turtles. Several drivers were seen to speed up when aiming for the decoys. Male drivers hit the reptile decoys more often than female drivers. However, 3.4% of male drivers and 3% of female drivers stopped to rescue the reptile decoys.

===Road salt accumulations===

On roadways where rumble strips are installed to provide a tactile vibration alerting drivers when drifting from their lane, the rumble strips may accumulate road salt in regions where it is used. The excess salt can accumulate and attract both small and large wildlife in search of salt licks; these animals are at great risk of becoming roadkill or causing accidents.

==Distribution and abundance==
Very large numbers of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates are killed on the world&#x27;s roads every day. A Humane Society volunteer survey conducted over three Memorial Day weekends in the 1960s estimated that one million vertebrate animals are killed by vehicular traffic daily in the United States. A 2008 Federal Highway Administration report estimates that 1 to 2 million accidents occur each year between large animals and vehicles. Extrapolating globally based on total length of roads, roughly 5.5 million vertebrates are killed per day, or over 2 billion annually.

The estimated number of birds killed on the roads in different European countries ranges from 350,000 to 27 million, depending on the factors such as the geography of the country and bird migration paths.

==Species affected==
Mortality resulting from roadkill can be very significant for species with small populations. Roadkill is estimated to be responsible for 50% of deaths of Florida panthers, and is the largest cause of badger deaths in England. Roadkill is considered to significantly contribute to the population decline of many threatened species, including wolf, koala and eastern quoll. In Tasmania, Australia the most common species affected by roadkill are brushtail possums and Tasmanian pademelons. In Bolivia there has been a report of an Andean cat, a critically endangered species, dead by a car collision. 

In 1993, 25 schools throughout New England, United States, participated in a roadkill study involving 1,923 animal deaths. By category, the fatalities were: 81% mammals, 15% bird, 3% reptiles and amphibians, 1% indiscernible. Extrapolating these data nationwide, Merritt Clifton (editor of &quot;Animal People Newspaper&quot;) estimated that the following animals are being killed by motor vehicles in the United States annually: 41 million squirrels, 26 million cats, 22 million rats, 19 million Virginia opossums, 15 million raccoons, 6 million dogs, and 350,000 deer. This study may not have considered differences in observability between taxa (e.g. dead raccoons are easier to see than dead frogs), and has not been published in peer-reviewed scientific literature. Observability, amongst other factors, may be the cause for mammal species to dominate roadkill reports, whereas bird and amphibian mortality are likely underestimated.

A year-long study in northern India in an agricultural landscape covering only 20 km of road identified 133 road kills of 33 species comprising amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. The study compared road-killed animals with all species seen along the road and estimated that traffic killed individuals of 30% of amphibian species, 25% of reptile species, 16% of birds, and 27% of mammals that were seen in the area. 

===Insects===

A 2007 study showed that insects, too, are prone to a very high risk of roadkill incidence. Research showed interesting patterns in insect roadkills in relation to the vehicle density.

The decrease in insects being killed by cars is known as the &quot;windshield phenomenon&quot;. In 2003–2004, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds investigated anecdotal reports of declining insect populations in the UK by asking drivers to affix a postcard-sized PVC rectangle, called a &quot;splatometer&quot;, to the front of their cars. Almost 40,000 drivers took part, and the results found one squashed insect for every driven. This contrasts with 30 years ago when cars were covered more completely with insects, supporting the idea that insect numbers had waned.

In 2011, Dutch biologist Arnold van Vliet coordinated a similar study of insect deaths on car license plates. He found two insects killed on the license-plate area for every driven. This implies about 1.6 trillion insect deaths by cars per year in the Netherlands, and about 32.5 trillion deaths in the United States if the figures are extrapolated there. The number grows to 228 trillion per year if extended globally. 

===Scavengers===
One rarely considered positive aspect of roadkill is the regular availability of carrion it provides for scavenger species such as vultures, crows, ravens, foxes, opossums and a wide variety of carnivorous insects. Areas with robust scavenger populations tend to see roadkilled animal corpses being quickly carried off, sometimes within minutes of being struck. This can skew data and cause a lower estimation of the number of roadkill animals per year. In particularly roadkill-prone areas, scavenging birds rely on roadkill for much of their daily nutritional requirements, and can even be seen observing the roadway from telephone poles, overhead wires and trees, waiting for animals, usually squirrels, opossums and raccoons to be struck so they can swoop down and feed. However, such scavengers are at greater risk of becoming roadkill themselves, and are subject to evolutionary pressure to be alert to traffic hazards.

In contrast, areas where scavengers have been driven out (such as many urban areas) often see roadkill rotting in place indefinitely on the roadways and being further macerated by traffic. The remains must be manually removed by dedicated disposal personnel and disposed of via cremation; this greatly increases the public nuisance inherent to roadkill, unnecessarily complicates its disposal, and consumes additional public money, time and fuel that could be spent on other roadway maintenance projects.

==Research==
===Roadkill observation projects===
The study of roadkill has proven highly amenable to the application of citizen science observation methods. Since 2009, statewide roadkill observation systems have been started in the US, enrolling hundreds of observers in reporting roadkill on a website. The observers, who are usually naturalists or professional scientists, provide identification, location, and other information about the observations. The data are then displayed on a website for easy visualization and made available for studies of proximate causes of roadkill, actual wildlife distributions, wildlife movement, and other studies. Roadkill observation system websites are available for the US states of California, Maine, and Idaho. In each case, index roads are used to help quantify total impact of vehicle collisions on specific vertebrate taxa. Researchers that use data from citizen science platforms may benefit from a large pool of data, specially for iconic, well known conspicuous species. Care must be taken when analyzing data for species that are not easy to identify, as studies have showed that misidentification is not uncommon amongst these platforms.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;The Road Lab&quot; (formerly Project Splatter) was started by Cardiff University in 2012, with the aim of estimating the impact of roads and motoring on British wildlife. Since then it has gathered data on its website, and on several social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter.

In India, the project &quot;Provide Animals Safe Transit on Highways&quot; (PATH) was initiated by the Environment Conservation Group in 2015, to study the impact of roads on Indian wildlife. A team of five wildlife conservationists led by R. Mohammed Saleem had undertaken a forty-four-day expedition, traveling more than 17,000 kilometers across 22 states to study and spread awareness on roadkill. It is also gathering data on its website, and social media platforms. More focused scientific studies on impacts of traffic on animals have been conducted across India especially in the Western Ghats of south India documenting a large number of species of insects, other arthropods, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals killed. Another study conducted on 420 km of roads located along cultivated fields in Punjab showed granivorous birds to be killed far more than their availability, likely attracted to spilled grain on the roads. 

In the Czech Republic, an online animal-vehicle crash reporting system Srazenazver.cz is gathering both professional (Police, road maintenance) and volunteered data on roadkill and wildlife-vehicle crashes. The application allows users to input, edit and browse data. The data is visualized in the form of maps, graphs or tables and analyzed online (KDE+ hotspots identification, area statistics).

In Australia, wombat roadkill data is collected by the citizen science project, WomSAT.

===State wildlife roadkill identification guide===

The first wildlife roadkill identification guide produced by a state agency in North America was published by the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation (BCMoT) in Canada in 2008. BCMoT&#x27;s &quot;Wildlife Roadkill Identification Guide&quot; focused on the most common large carnivores and ungulates found in British Columbia. The guide was developed to assist BCMoT&#x27;s maintenance contractors in identifying wildlife carcasses found on provincial highways as part of their responsibilities for BCMoT&#x27;s Wildlife Accident Reporting System (WARS).

==Prevention==


Collisions with animals can have many negative consequences:
*Death and suffering of animals struck by vehicles
*Injury to, or death of, vehicle occupants
*Harm to endangered species
*Loss of livestock or pets
*Vehicle damage
*Economic losses (cleanup, repairs to vehicles, etc.)
*Being a distasteful sight, particularly costly to locations economically reliant on tourism

Regardless of the spatial scale at which the mitigation measure is applied, there are two main types of roadkill mitigation measures: changing driver behavior, and changing wildlife behavior.

There are three potential ways to change driver behavior. Primary methods focus on changing driver attitude by increasing public awareness and helping people understand that reducing roadkill will benefit their community. The second potential way is to make people aware of specific hazardous areas by use of signage, rumble strips or lighting. The third potential way is to slow traffic physically or psychologically, using chicanes or speed bumps.

There are three categories of altering wildlife behavior. Primary methods discourage wildlife from loitering on roadsides by reducing food and water resources, or by making the road surfaces lighter in color which may make wildlife feel more exposed on the roadway. Second are methods of discouraging wildlife from crossing roads, at least when cars are present, using equipment such as ultrasonic whistles, reflectors, and fencing. Third are mechanisms to provide safe crossing like overpasses, underpasses and escape routes.

Although it is not illegal to help wild animals that are in danger of becoming roadkill, stopping on the highway is potentially dangerous and may result in injury or death of the person that is helping them and/or an inattentive driver that collides into their stopped vehicle.

===Large animals===

In the US, an estimated 1.25 million insurance claims are filed annually due to collisions with deer, elk, or moose, amounting to 1 out of 169 collision damage claims.

Collisions with large animals with antlers (such as deer) are particularly dangerous, but any large, long-legged animal (e.g. horses, larger cattle, camels) can pose a similar cabin incursion hazard. Injury to humans due to driver failure to maintain control of a vehicle either while avoiding, or during and immediately after an animal impact, is also common. Dusk and dawn are times of highest collision risk.

The recommended reaction to a large animal (such as a moose) is to slow down in lane, if at all possible, and to avoid swerving suddenly, which could cause loss of control. If a collision cannot be avoided, it is best to swerve towards the rear end of the animal, as it is more likely to run forward. Drivers who see a deer near or in the roadway should be aware that it is very likely that other members of a herd are nearby.

Acoustic warning deer horns can be mounted on vehicles to warn deer of approaching automobiles, though their effectiveness is disputed. Ultrasonic wind-driven whistles are often promoted as a cheap, simple way to reduce the chance of wildlife-vehicle collisions. In one study, the sound pressure level of the whistle was 3 dB above the sound pressure level of the test vehicle, but caused no observable difference in behavior of animals when the whistles were activated and not activated, casting doubt on their effectiveness.

In Australia, kangaroos are the most common species hit and killed by vehicles, causing significant damage and even fatalities. Another large species hit and killed by vehicles are wombats. Sightings of wombat roadkill can be logged at WomSAT to help support the implementation of mitigation strategies to reduce wombat deaths.

===Small animals===
Squirrels, rabbits, birds, or other small animals are often crushed by vehicles. Serious accidents may result from motorists swerving or stopping for squirrels in the road. Such evasive maneuvers are often unproductive, since small rodents and birds are much more agile and quicker to react than motorists in heavy vehicles. There is very little a driver can do to avoid an unpredictably darting squirrel or rabbit, or even to intentionally hit one. The suggested course of action is to continue driving in a predictable, safe manner, and let the small animal decide on the spur of the moment which way to run or fly; the majority of vehicular encounters end with no harm to either party.

===Night driving===
Although strikes can happen at any time of day, deer tend to move at dusk and dawn, and are particularly active during the October–December mating season as well as late March and early April in the Northern Hemisphere. Driving at night presents its own challenges: nocturnal species are active, and visibility, particularly side visibility, is reduced. Penguins, for example, are common roadkill traffic victims in Wellington, New Zealand due to their color and the fact that they come ashore at dusk and leave again around dawn.

Night time drivers should reduce speed and use high beam headlights when possible to give themselves maximum time to avoid a collision. However, when headlights approach a nocturnal animal, it is hard for the creature to see the approaching car (nocturnal animals see better in low than in bright light). Furthermore, the glare of oncoming vehicle headlights can dazzle some species, such as rabbits; they will freeze in the road rather than flee. It may be better to flash the headlights on and off, rather than leaving them on continuously while approaching an animal.

The simple tactics of reducing speed and scanning both sides of the road for foraging deer can improve driver safety at night, and drivers may see the retro-reflection of an animal&#x27;s eyes before seeing the animal itself.

===Wildlife crossings===
Wildlife crossings allow animals to travel over or underneath roads. They are most widely used in Europe, but have also been installed in a few US locations and in parts of Western Canada. As new highways cause habitats to become increasingly fragmented, these crossings can play an important role in protecting endangered species.

In the US, sections of road known to have heavy deer cross-traffic will usually have warning signs depicting a bounding deer; similar signs exist for moose, elk, and other species. In the American West, roads may pass through large areas designated as &quot;open range&quot;, meaning no fences separate drivers from large animals such as cattle or bison. A driver may round a bend to find a small herd standing in the road. Open range areas are generally marked with signage and protected by cattle grids.

In an attempt to mitigate US$1.2 billion in animal-related vehicular damage, a few US states now have sophisticated systems to protect motorists from large animals. One of these systems is called the Roadway Animal Detection System (RADS). A solar powered sensor can detect large animals such as deer, bear, elk, and moose near the roadway, and thereafter flash a light to alert oncoming drivers. The sensor&#x27;s detection distance ranges from to unlimited, depending on the terrain.

===Canopy crossings===

The removal of trees associated with road construction produces a gap in the forest canopy that forces arboreal (tree dwelling) species to come to the ground to travel across the gap. Canopy crossings have been constructed for red squirrels in Great Britain, colobus monkeys in Kenya, and ringtail possums in Far North Queensland, Australia. The crossings have two purposes: to ensure that roads do not restrict movement of animals and also to reduce roadkill. Installation of the canopy crossings may be relatively quick and cheap.

===Escape routes===
Banks, cuttings and fences that trap animals on the road are associated with roadkill. In order to increase the likelihood of escape from a main roadway, escape routes have been constructed on the access roads. Escape routes may be considered as one of the most useful measures, especially when new roads are being built or roads are being upgraded, widened or sealed. Research may be undertaken into the efficacy of escape routes by observation of animals’ response to vehicles in places with natural escape routes and barriers, rather than trialing purpose-built escape routes.

===Fencing===
In the New Forest, in southern England, there is a proposal to fence roads to protect the New Forest pony. However, this proposal is controversial.

==Disposal==
Removing animal carcasses from roadways is considered essential to public safety. The removal takes away the potential distraction and hazard of the carcass to other motorists. Quick removal can also prevent deaths of other animals that may wish to feed on the carcass, as well as animals that may go into the road to try to move the body of an animal in their social group. Sometimes rather than removal, the carcass is moved to a nearby public right-of-way where it can be consumed by scavengers, but not placed in a ditch or where waterways might be polluted. Covering the carcass with wood chips can aid in decomposition while minimizing odor.

Local governments and other levels of government have services that pick up dead animals from roadways, who will respond when advised about a dead animal.

New York City has an online request form which may be completed by residents of the city. New York State has a process to report dead wildlife to the Department of Environmental Conservation; they are especially interested in marked/tagged wildlife and endangered or threatened species.

In Toronto, Canada, the city accepts requests to remove a dead animal by telephone. If an animal is found along a major highway, depending on who has jurisdiction for maintaining the highway, the request may be directed to the city, the provincial Ministry of Transportation, or a highway operations centre. In Ontario, citizens may keep possession of roadkill in many circumstances, but may have to register their find.

==Eating roadkill==

If fresh enough, roadkill can be eaten, and there are several recipe books dedicated to roadkill. The practice of eating animals killed on the road is usually derided, and most people consider it not to be safe, sanitary, or wholesome. For example, when the Tennessee legislature attempted to legalize the use of accidentally killed animals, they became the subject of stereotyping and derisive humor. Nevertheless, in some cultures there is tradition of using fresh roadkill as a nutritious and economical source of meat similar to that obtained by hunting.

==Cultural references==
===Music===
Songwriter and performer Loudon Wainwright III released his deadpan humorous song, &quot;Dead Skunk (in the Middle of the Road)&quot; in 1972, and it peaked at number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

The American band Phish frequently plays the song &quot;Possum&quot;, originally from the album &quot;The Man Who Stepped into Yesterday&quot; at its concerts. The song describes an encounter with a roadkilled opossum and includes the lyric &quot;Your end is the road&quot;.

The Horse Flies, an American alt rock/folk band from Ithaca, NY, released an upbeat homage to vehicularly-mediated food security titled &quot;Roadkil&quot; on their 1991 album, &quot;Gravity Dance&quot; exhorting the listener to &quot;Eat what you kill&quot;.

===Art===
Roadkill is sometimes used as an art form. Several artists use traditional taxidermy preparation in their works whilst others explore different artforms. International artist Claudia Terstappen photographs roadkill and produces enormous prints which see the animals floating eerily in a void. American artist Gary Michael Keyes photographs and transforms them into &quot;RoadKill Totems&quot; in his &quot;Resurrection Gallery&quot;. American artist Stephen Paternite has been exhibiting roadkill pieces since the 1970s.

===Literature===
Canadian writer Timothy Findley wrote about the experience of seeing killed animals on highways during travels: &quot;The dead by the road, or on it, testify to the presence of man. Their little gestures of pain—paws, wings and tails—are the saddest, the loneliest, most forlorn postures of the dead I can imagine. When we have stopped killing animals as though they were so much refuse, we will stop killing one another. But the highways show our indifference to death, so long as it is someone else&#x27;s. It is an attitude of the human mind I do not grasp.&quot;

===Anthropology===
In a 2013 essay, American anthropologist Jane Desmond examined at length the failure of American culture and public discourse to adequately confront the ubiquity of roadkill. She concluded: &quot;The simplest answer is that these animal lives have little value for most of the populations in the United States, as these animals are unowned, lacking in monetary or emotional value, not pets or livestock, and without the charismatic following that megafauna like elephants and lions in zoos receive. This calculus of devaluation clears the way for such carnage to be ignored in public discourse and legal venues, to be out of mind while insistently in sight.&quot;

===Video games===
There are driving video games where players can run over animals, such as the arcade version of &quot;Cruis&#x27;n USA&quot;, as well as video games where players control an animal that crosses roads to avoid becoming roadkill, such as &quot;Frogger&quot; and &quot;Crossy Road&quot;.

<doc id="261106" wikidata="Q187317" url="?curid=261106" title="Fire pit">
<text>The defining feature of fire pits is that they are designed to contain fire and prevent it from spreading. A fire pit can vary from a pit dug in the ground (fire hole) to an elaborate gas burning structure of stone, brick, and metal. Certain contemporary fire pit styles include fire bowls that can either be set in the ground or elevated on legs. Fire rings are also frequently included as types of fire pits; these aboveground structures serve the same function.

==Contemporary types==

Pre-made fire pits are the most common form of fire pits and can be purchased from a store. These are commonly made of pre-cast concrete or metal or a combination of metal table and stone. They burn usually natural gas, propane (LP) or bio ethanol. Wood-burning fire pits made of metal are also quite common but are under increasing scrutiny due to fire bans and air particulate emissions.

Natural gas and propane burners in these sorts of pre-fabricated vessels are certified under ANSI (American), CSA (Canadian), and CE (European) standards. Unregulated and uncertified fire pit burners are increasingly being scrutinized by regulatory authorities and being denied permits. Fire pits have recommended clearance to combustibles and require at least 6 feet (1.8 m) above the flame and 16 inch (40 cm) circumference from the exterior perimeter of the vessel.

Essentially, a fire pit needs only a hole that can safely contain a fire. This can be as simple as a hole dug in the ground, or as complex as a holed-out brick or rock pillar. A wood-burning fire pit should be located at least ten feet (three meters) away from structures for safety. Use of a fire pit in adverse conditions should be avoided, and basic fire safety precautions apply.

== Dakota fire pit ==

The Dakota fire pit is an efficient, simple fire design that produces little to no smoke. Two small holes are dug in the ground: one for the firewood and the other to provide a draft of air. Small twigs are packed into the fire hole and readily combustible material is set on top and lit. The fire burns from the top downward, drawing a steady, laminar stream of fresh air from the air hole as it burns. Because the air passes freely around the fuel, near complete combustion is achieved, the result being a fire that burns strongly and brightly and with little or no seen smoke. The Dakota fire pit is a tactical fire used by the United States military as the flame produces a low light signature, reduced smoke, and is easier to ignite under strong wind conditions.

This style of fire pit is said to get its name from the Dakota people, who used it while hunting bison herds on the Great Plains. As well as resisting the strong winds of that area, the design also reduced the risk of causing a prairie fire.

== Fire pits in history ==
Many cultures, particularly nomadic ones, would cut the turf above the fire-pit in a turf cutting ceremony, replacing the turf afterwards to hide any evidence of the fire. The youth organization Woodcraft Folk also does this.

==Archaeological significance==
The remains of fire pits preserve information about past cultures. Radiocarbon dating from charcoal found in old fire pits can estimate when regions were first populated or when civilizations died out. Bones and seeds found in fire pits indicate the diet of that area.

In archaeological terms fire pits are referred to as features because they can be seen and recorded as part of the site but cannot be moved without being destroyed.
==Fire ring==
A fire ring is a construction or device used to contain campfires and prevent them from spreading and turning into wildfires.

A fire ring is designed to contain a fire that is built directly upon the ground, such as a campfire. Fire rings have no bottom, and are simply circles made of forged metal, stones, concrete, etc. which surround and contain a fire. Manufactured steel fire rings are available in various sizes to suit every need.

When a fire is to be built somewhere such as on a patio or in a backyard, a fire pit or outdoor fireplace may be better used instead. These are designed to contain the entire fire instead of just keeping it in one place.
A fire ring may be nothing more than a short, wide section of metal tube, partially buried in the ground. Slightly more advanced fire rings may be partially covered with metal bars so that the fire may be used for cooking. These types are seen at many campgrounds. Fire rings in urban areas, such as on beaches, may be made of poured concrete. Makeshift fire rings can be constructed out of a ring of stones where pre-constructed rings are not available, but care should be taken as some stones can explode when heated due to trapped gas pockets, thermal expansion, or water contained flashing into steam.

<doc id="261107" wikidata="Q499639" url="?curid=261107" title="Strangers on a Train (film)">
<text>Strangers on a Train is a 1951 American psychological thriller film noir produced and directed by Alfred Hitchcock, based on the 1950 novel of the same name by Patricia Highsmith. It was shot in late 1950, and released by Warner Bros. on June 30, 1951, starring Farley Granger, Ruth Roman and Robert Walker.

The story concerns two strangers who meet on a train, one of whom is a psychopath who suggests that they &quot;exchange&quot; murders so that neither will be caught. The film initially received mixed reviews, but has since been regarded much more favorably. In 2021, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

Amateur tennis star Guy Haines wants to divorce his promiscuous wife, Miriam, so he can marry Anne Morton, the daughter of a US Senator. On a train, wealthy smooth-talking psychopath Bruno Antony recognizes Haines and reveals his idea for a murder scheme: two strangers meet and &quot;swap murders&quot;—Bruno suggests he kill Miriam and Guy kill Bruno&#x27;s hated father. Each will murder a stranger, with no apparent motive, so neither will be suspected. Guy humors Bruno by pretending to find his idea amusing but is so eager to get away from Bruno that he leaves behind his engraved cigarette lighter.

Guy meets Miriam, who is pregnant by someone else, at her workplace in Metcalf, their hometown. Guy gives her the money she demanded to pay for a divorce lawyer, but Miriam tells him she is no longer interested in a divorce, and threatens to claim that he is the father if he pursues a divorce. That evening Bruno follows Miriam to an amusement park and strangles her while Guy is on the train to Washington, D.C. When Guy arrives home Bruno informs him Miriam is dead and insists that he must now honor their deal.

Guy goes to the Mortons&#x27; home, where Anne&#x27;s father informs Guy that his wife has been murdered. Anne&#x27;s sister, Barbara, says that the police will think that Guy is the murderer since he has a motive. The police question Guy but cannot confirm his alibi: a professor Guy met on the train was so drunk that he cannot remember their encounter. The police assign an escort to watch him.

Bruno follows Guy around Washington, introduces himself to Anne, and appears at a party at Senator Morton&#x27;s house. To amuse another guest, Bruno playfully demonstrates how to strangle a woman. His gaze falls upon Barbara, whose appearance resembles Miriam&#x27;s. This triggers a flashback: Bruno compulsively squeezes the woman&#x27;s neck, and other guests intervene to stop him from strangling her to death. Barbara tells Anne that Bruno was looking at her while strangling the other woman, and Anne realizes Barbara&#x27;s resemblance to Miriam. Her suspicions aroused, Anne confronts Guy, who tells her the truth about Bruno&#x27;s scheme.

Bruno sends Guy a package containing a pistol, a house key, and a map showing the location of his father&#x27;s bedroom. Guy creeps into Bruno&#x27;s father&#x27;s room to warn him of his son&#x27;s murderous intentions but instead finds Bruno there waiting for him. Guy tries to persuade Bruno to seek psychiatric help, but Bruno threatens to punish Guy for breaking their deal.

Anne visits Bruno&#x27;s home and tries to explain to his befuddled and besotted mother that her son is a murderer. Bruno mentions Guy&#x27;s missing cigarette lighter to Anne and claims that Guy asked him to search the murder site for it. Guy infers that Bruno intends to plant it at the scene of the murder and incriminate him. After winning a tennis match helped by Barbara, Guy evades the police escort and heads for the amusement park to stop Bruno.

When Bruno arrives at the amusement park, a carnival worker recognizes him from the night of the murder; he informs the police, who think he has recognized Guy. After Guy arrives, he and Bruno fight on the park&#x27;s carousel. Believing that Guy is trying to escape, a police officer shoots at him but instead kills the carousel operator, causing the carousel to spin out of control. A carnival worker crawls underneath it and applies the brakes too abruptly, causing the carousel to spin off its support, trapping the mortally injured Bruno underneath. The worker who called the police tells them that Bruno, not Guy, is the one he remembers seeing the night of the murder. As Bruno dies, his fingers unclench to reveal Guy&#x27;s lighter in his hand. Realizing that Guy is not the murderer, the police ask him to come to the station to tie up loose ends.

Some time later, another stranger on a train attempts to strike up conversation with Guy in the same way as Bruno did. Guy and Anne abruptly hurry away from him.

Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s cameo appearance occurs 11 minutes into the film. He is seen carrying a double bass as he climbs onto a train.

Hitchcock said that correct casting saved him &quot;a reel of storytelling time&quot;, since audiences would sense qualities in the actors that did not have to be spelled out. Hitchcock said that he originally wanted William Holden for the Guy Haines role, but Holden declined. &quot;Holden would have been all wrong—too sturdy, too put off by Bruno&quot;, wrote critic Roger Ebert. &quot;Granger is softer and more elusive, more convincing as he tries to slip out of Bruno&#x27;s conversational web instead of flatly rejecting him.&quot;

Warner Bros wanted their own stars, already under contract, cast wherever possible. In the casting of Anne Morton, Jack L. Warner got what he wanted when he assigned Ruth Roman to the project, over Hitchcock&#x27;s objections. The director found her &quot;bristling&quot; and &quot;lacking in sex appeal&quot; and said that she had been &quot;foisted upon him&quot;. Perhaps it was the circumstances of her forced casting, but Roman became the target of Hitchcock&#x27;s scorn throughout the production. Granger described Hitchcock&#x27;s attitude toward Roman as &quot;disinterest&quot; in the actress and said he saw Hitchcock treat Edith Evanson the same way on the set of &quot;Rope&quot; (1948). &quot;He had to have one person in each film he could harass&quot;, Granger said.

Kasey Rogers noted that she had perfect vision at the time the film was made, but Hitchcock insisted she wear the character&#x27;s thick eyeglasses, even in long shots when regular glass lenses would have been undetectable. Rogers was effectively blind with the glasses on and needed to be guided by the other actors.

==Production==

===Pre-production===
Hitchcock secured the rights to the Patricia Highsmith novel for just $7,500 since it was her first novel. As usual, Hitchcock kept his name out of the negotiations to keep the purchase price low. Highsmith was quite annoyed when she later discovered who had bought the rights for such a small amount.

Securing the rights to the novel was the least of the hurdles Hitchcock would have to vault to get the property from printed page to screen. He got a treatment that pleased him on the second attempt, from writer Whitfield Cook, who wove a homoerotic subtext into the story. With treatment in hand, Hitchcock shopped for a screenwriter; he wanted a &quot;name&quot; writer to lend some prestige to the screenplay but was turned down by eight writers, including John Steinbeck and Thornton Wilder, all of whom thought the story too tawdry and were put off by Highsmith&#x27;s first-timer status. Talks with Dashiell Hammett got further, but here too communications ultimately broke down, and Hammett never took the assignment.

Hitchcock then tried Raymond Chandler, who had earned an Oscar nomination for his first screenplay, &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, in collaboration with Billy Wilder. Chandler took the job despite his opinion that it was &quot;a silly little story.&quot; But Chandler was a notoriously difficult collaborator and the two men could not have had more different meeting styles: Hitchcock enjoyed long, rambling off-topic meetings where often the film would not even be mentioned for hours, while Chandler was strictly business and wanted to get out and get writing. He called the meetings &quot;god-awful jabber sessions which seem to be an inevitable although painful part of the picture business.&quot; Chandler also felt that the original novel&#x27;s plot was superior to Hitchcock&#x27;s version and argued that it should be restored. He complained privately that Hitchcock was too ready “to sacrifice dramatic logic (insofar as it exists) for the sake of a camera effect.” Interpersonal relations deteriorated rapidly until finally Chandler became openly combative: at one point, on noticing Hitchcock struggling to exit from his limousine, Chandler remarked within earshot, &quot;Look at the fat bastard trying to get out of his car!&quot; This would be their last collaboration. Chandler completed a first draft, then wrote a second, without hearing a single word back from Hitchcock; when finally he did get a communication from the director in late September, it was his dismissal from the project.

Next, Hitchcock tried to hire Ben Hecht, but learned he was unavailable. Hecht suggested his assistant, Czenzi Ormonde, to write the screenplay. Although Ormonde was without a formal screen credit, she did have two things in her favor: her recently published collection of short stories, &quot;Laughter From Downstairs&quot;, was attracting good notices from critics, and she was &quot;a fair-haired beauty with long shimmering hair.&quot;—always a plus with Hitchcock. With his new writer, he wanted to start from square one:

There was not much time though—less than three weeks until location shooting was scheduled to start in the East. Ormonde hunkered down with Hitchcock&#x27;s associate producer Barbara Keon—disparagingly called &quot;Hitchcock&#x27;s factotum&quot; by Chandler—and Alma Reville, Hitchcock&#x27;s wife. Together the three women, working under the boss&#x27;s guidance and late into most nights, finished enough of the script in time to send the company East. The rest was complete by early November. Three notable additions the trio had made were the runaway merry-go-round, the cigarette lighter, and the thick eyeglasses.

There was one point of agreement between Chandler and Hitchcock, although it would come only much later, near the release of the film: they both acknowledged that since virtually none of Chandler&#x27;s work remained in the final script, his name should be removed from the credits. Hitchcock preferred the writing credit of Whitfield Cook and Czenzi Ormonde, but Warner Bros. wanted the cachet of the Chandler name and insisted it stay on.

Even while the tortuous writing stage was plodding its course, the director&#x27;s excitement about the project was boundless. &quot;Hitchcock raced ahead of everyone: the script, the cast, the studio... pieces of the film were dancing like electrical charges in his brain.&quot; The more the film resolved in his mind&#x27;s eye, the more he knew his director of photography would play a critical role in the scenes&#x27; execution. He found exactly what he needed right on the Warners lot in the person of staff cameraman Robert Burks, who would continue to work with Hitchcock, shooting every Hitchcock picture through to &quot;Marnie&quot; (1964), with the exception of &quot;Psycho&quot;. &quot;Low-keyed, mild mannered&quot;, Burks was &quot;a versatile risk-taker with a penchant for moody atmosphere. Burks was an exceptionally apt choice for what would prove to be Hitchcock&#x27;s most Germanic film in years: the compositions dense, the lighting almost surreal, the optical effects demanding.&quot; None was more demanding than Bruno&#x27;s strangulation of Miriam, shown reflected in her eyeglass lens: &quot;It was the kind of shot Hitchcock had been tinkering with for twenty years—and Robert Burks captured it magnificently.&quot;

Burks considered his fourteen years with Hitchcock the best of his career: &quot;You never have any trouble with him as long as you know your job and do it. Hitchcock insists on perfection. He has no patience with mediocrity on the set or at a dinner table. There can be no compromise in his work, his food or his wines.&quot; Robert Burks received the film&#x27;s sole Academy Award nomination for its black and white photography.

===Production===
With cast nailed down, a script in hand, and a director of photography in tune with Hitchcock&#x27;s vision on board, the company was ready to commence filming. Hitchcock had a crew shoot background footage of the 1950 Davis Cup finals held August 25–27, 1950 at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, New York. While there, the crew had done some other location scouting. Exteriors would be shot on both coasts, and interiors on Warner Brothers&#x27; soundstages.

Hitchcock and his cast and crew decamped for the East Coast on October 17, 1950. For six days, they shot at Penn Station in New York City, at the railroad station at Danbury, Connecticut—which became Guy&#x27;s hometown of Metcalf—and in spots around Washington, D.C.

By month&#x27;s end, they were back in California. Hitchcock had written exacting specifications for an amusement park, which was constructed on the ranch of director Rowland Lee in Chatsworth, California. The amusement park exteriors were shot there and at an actual Tunnel of Love at a fairground in Canoga Park, California. Hitchcock had already shot the long shots for the tennis match at Forest Hills and would add closer shots with Granger and Jack Cushingham, Granger&#x27;s tennis coach off-screen and Guy&#x27;s tennis opponent Fred Reynolds on-screen at a tennis club in South Gate, California. The rest of the shooting would take place on Warner soundstages, including many seemingly exterior and on-location shots that were actually done inside in front of rear-projection screens.

&quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; marked something of a renaissance for Hitchcock, after several years of low enthusiasm for his late-1940s output, and he threw himself into the micromanagement of some of its production. Hitchcock himself designed Bruno&#x27;s lobster necktie, revealed in a close-up to have strangling lobster claws, and &quot;he personally selected an orange peel, a chewing-gum wrapper, wet leaves, and a bit of crumpled paper that were used for sewer debris&quot; in the scene where Bruno inadvertently drops Guy&#x27;s lighter down the storm drain.

He also showed intense interest in a seldom-considered detail of character delineation: food.


One of the most memorable single shots in the Hitchcock canon—it &quot;is studied by film classes&quot;, says Kasey Rogers, who played Miriam—is her character&#x27;s strangulation by Bruno on the Magic Isle. &quot;[I]n one of the most unexpected, most aesthetically justified moments in film,&quot; the slow, almost graceful, murder is shown as a reflection in the victim&#x27;s eyeglasses, which have been jarred loose from her head and dropped to the ground. The unusual angle was a more complex proposition than it seems. First Hitchcock got the exterior shots in Canoga Park, using both actors, then later he had Rogers alone report to a soundstage where there was a large concave reflector set on the floor. The camera was on one side of the reflector, Rogers was on the other, and Hitchcock directed Rogers to turn her back to the reflector and &quot;float backwards, all the way to the floor... like you were doing the limbo.&quot; The first six takes went badly—Rogers thudded to the floor with several feet yet to go—but on the seventh take, she floated smoothly all the way. Hitchcock&#x27;s even-strained response: &quot;Cut. Next shot.&quot; Hitchcock then had the two elements &quot;ingenious[ly]&quot; double printed, yielding a shot of &quot;oddly appealing originality [with] a stark fusion of the grotesque and the beautiful... The aestheticizing of the horror somehow enables the audience to contemplate more fully its reality.&quot;

Hitchcock was, above all, the master of great visual set piece, and &quot;[p]erhaps the most memorable sequence in &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; is the climactic fight on a berserk carousel.&quot; While Guy and Bruno fight, the ride runs out of control until it tears itself to pieces, flinging wooden horses into the crowd of screaming mothers and squealing children. &quot;The climactic carousel explosion was a marvel of miniatures and background projection, acting close-ups and other inserts, all of it seamlessly matched and blended under film editor William H. Ziegler&#x27;s eye.&quot;

The explosion is triggered by the attempts of a carnival man to stop the ride after crawling under the whirling carousel deck to get to the controls in the center. Although Hitchcock admitted to undercranking the shot (artificially accelerating the action), it was not a trick shot: the man actually had to crawl under the spinning ride, just inches from possible injury. &quot;Hitchcock told me that this scene was the most personally frightening moment for him in any of his films&quot;, writes biographer Charlotte Chandler. &quot;The man who crawled under the out-of-control carousel was not an actor or a stuntman, but a carousel operator who volunteered for the job. &#x27;If the man had raised his head even slightly&quot;, Hitchcock said, &quot;it would have gone from being a suspense film into a horror film.&quot;

The final scene of the so-called American version of the film has Barbara and Anne Morton waiting for Guy to call on the telephone. Hitchcock wanted the phone in the foreground to dominate the shot, emphasizing the importance of the call, but the limited depth-of-field of contemporary motion picture lenses made it difficult to get both phone and women in focus. So Hitchcock had an oversized phone constructed and placed in the foreground. Anne reaches for the big phone, but actually answers a regular one: &quot;I did that on one take&quot;, Hitchcock explained, &quot;by moving in on Anne so that the big phone went out of the frame as she reached for it. Then a grip put a normal-sized phone on the table, where she picked it up.&quot;

Principal photography wrapped just before Christmas, and Hitchcock and Alma left for a vacation in Santa Cruz, then in late March 1951, on to St Moritz, for a 25th-anniversary European excursion.

While he had previous Hitchcock experience on &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; (1943), and would go on to score two more consecutive Hitchcock films, the director and composer &quot;simply never developed much of a kinship&quot; and &quot;the Hitchcock films are not Tiomkin&#x27;s best&quot;.

Nevertheless, the score does pick up on the ubiquitous theme of &quot;doubles&quot;—often &quot;contrasting&quot; doubles—right from the opening title sequence: &quot;The first shot—two sets of male shoes, loud versus conservative, moving toward a train—carries a gruff bass motif set against Gershwin-like riffs, a two-part medley called &quot;Strangers&quot; and &quot;Walking&quot; that is never heard again.&quot; The powerful music accurately underscores the visuals of that title sequence—the massive granite edifice of New York&#x27;s Pennsylvania Station, standing in for Washington&#x27;s Union Station—because it was scored for an unusually large orchestra, including alto, tenor and baritone saxes, three clarinets, four horns, three pianos and a novachord.

Tiomkin&#x27;s contrasting musical themes continued throughout the film, delineating two characters with substantial differences: &quot;For &#x27;Guy&#x27;s Theme&#x27;, Tiomkin created a hesitant, passive idea, made-to-order music for Farley Granger&#x27;s performance.&quot; Bruno, who tells Guy on the train that he admires people &quot;who do things&quot;, gets a more vigorous musical treatment from Tiomkin: &quot;Harmonic complexity defines the motifs associated with Bruno: rumbling bass, shocking clusters, and glassy string harmonics. These disturbing sounds, heard to superb effect in cues such as &#x27;The Meeting,&#x27; &#x27;Senator&#x27;s Office,&#x27; and &#x27;Jefferson Memorial,&#x27; are not just about Bruno, but about how he is perceived by those whose lives he crosses—first Guy, then everyone in Guy&#x27;s entourage.&quot;

But perhaps the most memorable music in &quot;Strangers&quot; is the calliope music, heard first at the fairground and again, later, when Bruno is strangling Mrs Cunningham at Senator Morton&#x27;s soirée and experiences his unfortunate flashback and subsequent fainting spell. It was Hitchcock, not Tiomkin, whose idea brought the four evocative numbers—&quot;The Band Played On&quot;, &quot;Carolina in the Morning&quot;, &quot;Oh, You Beautiful Doll&quot;, and &quot;Baby Face&quot;—to the soundtrack:In one of Hitchcock&#x27;s most explicit operatic gestures, the characters at the fateful carnival sing the score, giving it full dimension as part of the drama. In a conventional movie, the tune would play in the background as a clever ironic backdrop. But Hitchcock takes music to another level. Miriam and the two boyfriends in her odd ménage à trois bring &quot;The Band Played On&quot; to life by singing it on the merry-go-round, lustily and loudly... Grinning balefully on the horse behind them, Bruno then sings it himself, making it his motto. The band plays on through Bruno&#x27;s stalking of his victim and during the murder itself, blaring from the front of the screen, then receding into the darkness as an eerie obbligato when the doomed Miriam enters the Tunnel of Love.&quot;The Band Played On&quot; makes its final reprise during Guy&#x27;s and Bruno&#x27;s fight on the merry-go-round, even itself shifting to a faster tempo and higher pitch when the policeman&#x27;s bullet hits the ride operator and sends the carousel into its frenzied hyper-drive.

Critic Jack Sullivan had kinder words for Tiomkin&#x27;s score for &quot;Strangers&quot; than did biographer Spoto: &quot;[S]o seamlessly and inevitably does it fit the picture&#x27;s design that it seems like an element of Hitchcock&#x27;s storyboards&quot;, he writes. It is a score that &quot;goes largely uncelebrated.&quot;

===Promotion and release===
With a release scheduled for early summer, the studio press agents swung into high gear early in 1951. Hitchcock, promotionally photographed many times over the years strangling various actresses and other women—some one-handed, others two—found himself in front of a camera with his fingers around the neck of a bust of daughter Patricia; the photo found its way into newspapers nationwide. He was also photographed adding the letter &quot;L&quot; to &quot;Strangers&quot; on the official studio poster for the film, thus changing the word to &quot;Stranglers&quot;.

One studio press release gave rise to a myth that still lingers on today. Hitchcock and Patricia both were afraid of heights, and father offered daughter a hundred dollars to ride the Ferris wheel—only to order the power cut, leaving her in the dark at the very top of the ride. The press release embellished the tale, claiming he left her &quot;dangling in total darkness for an hour,&quot; only then allowing his &quot;trembling daughter&quot; to be lowered and released. Although that account continues to be published in books to this day, &quot;it just wasn&#x27;t true&quot;, according to Patricia Hitchcock O&#x27;Connell. First of all, she was not up there alone: flanking her were the actors playing Miriam&#x27;s two boyfriends—&quot;and I have a picture of us waving.&quot; &quot;This was good stuff for press agents paid to stir up thrills and it has been repeated in other books to bolster the idea of Hitchcock&#x27;s sadism,&quot; but &quot;we were [only] up there two or three minutes at the outside... My father wasn&#x27;t ever sadistic. The only sadistic part was I never got the hundred dollars.&quot;

&quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; previewed on March 5, 1951, at the Huntington Park Theatre, with Alma, Jack Warner, Whitfield Cook and Barbara Keon in the Hitchcock party and it won a prize from the Screen Directors Guild. It premiered in New York on July 3, marking the reopening of the extensively remodeled Strand Theatre as the Warner Theatre, and in a dozen cities around the country. Hitchcock made personal appearances in most of them, and was often accompanied by his daughter.

Some audience feedback arriving at Jack Warner&#x27;s office condemned the film for its sordid story, while just as many others were favorable. Of greater interest to Warner was the box office take, and the &quot;receipts soon told the true story: &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; was a success, and Hitchcock was pronounced at the top of his form as master of the dark, melodramatic suspense thriller.&quot;

==Themes and motifs==
The film includes a number of puns and visual metaphors that demonstrate a running motif of crisscross, double-crossing, and crossing one&#x27;s double. Talking about the structure of the film, Hitchcock said to Truffaut, &quot;Isn&#x27;t it a fascinating design? One could study it forever.&quot;

The two characters, Guy and Bruno, can be viewed as doppelgängers. As with &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot;, &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; is one of many Hitchcock films to explore the doppelgänger theme. The pair has what writer Peter Dellolio refers to as a &quot;dark symbiosis.&quot; Bruno embodies Guy&#x27;s dark desire to kill Miriam, a &quot;real-life incarnation of Guy&#x27;s wish-fulfillment fantasy&quot;.

===Doubles===
The theme of &quot;doubles&quot; is &quot;the key element in the film&#x27;s structure,&quot; and Hitchcock starts right off in his title sequence making this point: there are two taxicabs, two redcaps, two pairs of feet, two sets of train rails that cross twice. Once on the train, Bruno orders a pair of double drinks—&quot;The only kind of doubles I play&quot;, he says charmingly. In Hitchcock&#x27;s cameo he carries a double bass.

Hitchcock carries the theme into his editing, crosscutting between Guy and Bruno with words and gestures: one asks the time and the other, miles away, looks at his watch; one says in anger &quot;I could strangle her!&quot; and the other, far distant, makes a choking gesture.

This doubling has some precedent in the novel, but more of it was deliberately added by Hitchcock, &quot;dictated in rapid and inspired profusion to Czenzi Ormonde and Barbara Keon during the last days of script preparation.&quot; It undergirds the whole film because it finally serves to associate the world of light, order, and vitality with the world of darkness, chaos, lunacy and death.&quot;

Guy and Bruno are in some ways doubles, but in many more ways, they are &quot;opposites&quot;. The two sets of feet in the title sequence match each other in motion and in cutting, but they immediately establish the contrast between the two men: the first shoes &quot;showy, vulgar brown-and-white brogues; [the] second, plain, unadorned walking shoes.&quot; They also demonstrate Hitchcock&#x27;s gift for deft visual storytelling: For most of the film, Bruno is the actor, Guy the reactor, and Hitchcock always shows Bruno&#x27;s feet first, then Guy&#x27;s. And since it is Guy&#x27;s foot that taps Bruno&#x27;s under the table, we know Bruno has not engineered the meeting.

Roger Ebert wrote that &quot;it is this sense of two flawed characters—one evil, one weak, with an unstated sexual tension—that makes the movie intriguing and halfway plausible, and explains how Bruno could come so close to carrying out his plan.&quot;

===Darkness–light continuum===
It is those flaws that set up the real themes of &quot;Strangers.&quot; It was not enough for Hitchcock to construct merely a world of doubles—even contrasting doubles—in a strict polar-opposite structure; for Hitchcock, the good-and-evil, darkness-and-light poles &quot;didn&#x27;t have to be mutually exclusive.&quot; Blurring the lines puts both Guy and Bruno on a good-evil continuum, and the infinite shades of gray in between, became Hitchcock&#x27;s canvas for telling the story and painting his characters.

At first glance, Guy represents the ordered life where people stick to rules, while Bruno comes from the world of chaos, where they get thrown out of multiple colleges for drinking and gambling. Yet both men, like so many of Hitchcock&#x27;s protagonists, are insecure and uncertain of their identity. Guy is suspended between tennis and politics, between his tramp wife and his senator&#x27;s daughter, and Bruno is seeking desperately to establish an identity through violent, &quot;outré&quot; actions and flamboyance (shoes, lobster-patterned tie, name proclaimed to the world on his tiepin).&quot;

Bruno tells Guy early on that he admires him: &quot;I certainly admire people who do things&quot;, he says. &quot;Me, I never do anything important.&quot; Yet as Bruno describes his &quot;theories&quot; over lunch, &quot;Guy responds to Bruno—we see it in his face, at once amused and tense. To the man committed to a career in politics, Bruno represents a tempting overthrow of all responsibility.&quot; And at this point the blurring of good and evil accelerates: Guy fails to repudiate Bruno&#x27;s suggestive statement about murdering Miriam (&quot;What&#x27;s a life or two, Guy? Some people are better off dead.&quot;) with any force or conviction. &quot;When Bruno openly suggests he would like to kill his wife, he merely grins and says &#x27;That&#x27;s a morbid thought,&#x27; but we sense the tension that underlies it.&quot; It ratchets up a notch when Guy leaves Bruno&#x27;s compartment and &quot;forgets&quot; his cigarette lighter. &quot;He is leaving in Bruno&#x27;s keeping his link with Anne, his possibility of climbing into the ordered existence to which he aspires... Guy, then, in a sense connives at the murder of his wife, and the enigmatic link between him and Bruno becomes clear.&quot;

===Light and dark onscreen===
Having given his characters overlapping qualities of good and evil, Hitchcock then rendered them on the screen according to a very strict template, with which he stuck to a remarkable degree. Ebert wrote:

Nowhere is this more evident than the scene where Guy arrives home at his D.C. apartment to find Bruno lurking across the street; Bruno killed Miriam that evening in Metcalf, and has her glasses to give to Guy almost as a &quot;receipt&quot; that he has executed &quot;his&quot; part of their &quot;deal&quot;. &quot;On one side of the street, [are] stately respectable houses; towering in the background, on the right of the screen, the floodlit dome of the U.S. Capitol, the life to which Guy aspires, the world of light and order.&quot; Bruno tells Guy what he has done and gives him the glasses. &quot;You&#x27;re a free man now&quot;, he says, just as a police car drives up, looking for the husband of a certain recent murder victim. Guy nervously steps into the shadows with Bruno, literally behind the bars of an iron fence; &quot;You&#x27;ve got me acting like I&#x27;m a criminal&quot;, he says. &quot;The scene gives a beautifully exact symbolic expression to Guy&#x27;s relationship with Bruno and what he stands for.&quot;

Hitchcock continues the interplay of light and dark throughout the film: Guy&#x27;s bright, light tennis attire, versus &quot;the gothic gloominess of [Bruno&#x27;s] Arlington mansion&quot;; the crosscutting between his game in the sunshine at Forest Hills while Bruno&#x27;s arm stretches into the dark and debris of the storm drain trying to fish out the cigarette lighter; even a single image where &quot;Walker is photographed in one visually stunning shot as a malignant stain on the purity of the white-marble Jefferson Memorial, as a blot on the order of things.&quot;

===Political subtext===
Although its first rumblings came in 1947 with the trial and conviction of the &quot;Hollywood Ten,&quot; the so-called Red Scare was gathering steam in 1950, with the espionage-related arrests of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and the trial of Alger Hiss. These events were the background to their work, while Hitchcock, Cook, Ormonde and Keon were preparing the script for &quot;Strangers&quot;, and film scholar Robert L. Carringer has written of a political subtext to the film. Treatment writer Cook used Guy to make the film &quot;a parable quietly defiant of the Cold War hysteria sweeping America.&quot;

Carringer has argued that the film was crucially shaped by the Congressional inquiries, making Guy the stand-in for victims of the homophobic climate. &quot;To all appearances Guy is the all-American stereotype, an athlete, unassuming despite his fame, conservatively dressed,&quot; wrote Carringer; he is &quot;a man of indeterminate sexual identity found in circumstances making him vulnerable to being compromised.&quot; Hitchcock, who had drawn gay characters so sharply yet subtly in &quot;Rope&quot; in 1948, &quot;drafted the left-leaning Cook... expressly because he was comfortable with sexually ambiguous characters.&quot;

===Differences from the novel===
Even before sewing up the rights for the novel, Hitchcock&#x27;s mind was whirling with ideas about how to adapt it for the screen. He narrowed the geographic scope to the Northeast corridor, between Washington, D.C., and New York—the novel ranged through the southwest and Florida, among other locales. The scripting team added the tennis match—and the crosscutting with Bruno&#x27;s storm drain travails in Metcalf—added the cigarette lighter, the Tunnel of Love, Miriam&#x27;s eyeglasses; in fact, the amusement park is only a brief setting in the novel.

Hitchcock&#x27;s biggest changes were in his two lead characters:

The character called Bruno Antony in the film is called Charles Anthony Bruno in the book. In the book, Bruno dies in a boating accident far removed from a merry-go-round.

In the novel, Guy Haines is not a tennis player, but rather a promising architect, and he does indeed go through with the murder of Bruno&#x27;s father. In the movie, &quot;Guy became a decent guy who &quot;refuses&quot; to carry out his part of the crazed bargain...&quot; writes Patrick McGilligan, &quot;to head off the censors.&quot; In the novel, Guy is pursued and entrapped by a tenacious detective.

The merry-go-round scene is not in the book, but is taken from the climax of Edmund Crispin&#x27;s 1946 novel &quot;The Moving Toyshop&quot;. All the major elements of the scene—the two men struggling, the accidentally shot attendant, the out-of-control merry-go-round, the crawling under the moving merry-go-round to disable it—are present in Crispin&#x27;s account, though he received no screen credit for it.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Upon its release in 1951, &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; received mixed reviews. &quot;Variety&quot; praised it, writing: &quot;Performance-wise, the cast comes through strongly. Granger is excellent as the harassed young man innocently involved in murder. Roman&#x27;s role as a nice, understanding girl is a switch for her, and she makes it warmly effective. Walker&#x27;s role has extreme color, and he projects it deftly.&quot;

Conversely, Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized the film: &quot;Mr. Hitchcock again is tossing a crazy murder story in the air and trying to con us into thinking that it will stand up without support. ... Perhaps there will be those in the audience who will likewise be terrified by the villain&#x27;s darkly menacing warnings and by Mr. Hitchcock&#x27;s sleekly melodramatic tricks. ... But, for all that, his basic premise of fear fired by menace is so thin and so utterly unconvincing that the story just does not stand.&quot; Leslie Halliwell felt that Hitchcock was &quot;at his best&quot; and that the film &quot;makes superior suspense entertainment,&quot; but called the story &quot;unsatisfactory.&quot;

In contrast, modern reviews have been overwhelmingly positive. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 98% based on reviews from 52 critics, with an average rating of 8.80/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;A provocative premise and inventive set design lights the way for Hitchcock[&#x27;s] diabolically entertaining masterpiece.&quot; Roger Ebert has called &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; a &quot;first-rate thriller&quot; that he considers one of Hitchcock&#x27;s five best films. He added the film in his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list. In 2012, &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised the film writing &quot;Hitchcock&#x27;s study of the guilt that taints the human condition is just one cinematic masterstroke after another&quot;.

David Keyes, writing at &quot;Cinemaphile&quot; in 2002, saw the film as a seminal entry in its genre: &quot;Aside from its very evident approach as a crowd-pleasing popcorn flick, the movie is one of the original shells for identity-inspired mystery thrillers, in which natural human behavior is the driving force behind the true macabre rather than supernatural elements. Even classic endeavors like &quot;Fargo&quot; and &quot;A Simple Plan&quot; seem directly fueled by this concept...&quot;

Almar Haflidason was effusive about &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; in 2001 at the BBC website: &quot;Hitchcock&#x27;s favourite device of an ordinary man caught in an ever-tightening web of fear plunges Guy into one of the director&#x27;s most fiendishly effective movies. Ordinary Washington locations become sinister hunting grounds that mirror perfectly the creeping terror that slowly consumes Guy, as the lethally smooth Bruno relentlessly pursues him to a frenzied climax. Fast, exciting, and woven with wicked style, this is one of Hitchcock&#x27;s most efficient and ruthlessly delicious thrillers.&quot;

Patricia Highsmith&#x27;s opinion of the film varied over time. She initially praised it, writing: &quot;I am pleased in general. Especially with Bruno, who held the movie together as he did the book.&quot; Later in life, while still praising Robert Walker&#x27;s performance as Bruno, she criticized the casting of Ruth Roman as Anne, Hitchcock&#x27;s decision to turn Guy from an architect into a tennis player and the fact that Guy does not murder Bruno&#x27;s father as he does in the novel.

===Box office===
According to Warner Bros&#x27; records, the film earned $1,788,000 domestically and $1,144,000 in foreign territories.

===Accolades===
American Film Institute listed the film as #32 in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills.

==Alternative versions==
An early preview edit of the film, sometimes labelled the &quot;British&quot; version although it was never released in Britain or anywhere else, includes some scenes either not in, or else different from, the film as released. According to biographer Charlotte Chandler (Lyn Erhard), Hitchcock himself did not like either the &quot;British&quot; &quot;or&quot; the &quot;American&quot; version:

In 1997, Warner released the film onto DVD as a double sided disc, with the &quot;British&quot; version on one side, and the &quot;Hollywood&quot; version on the reverse. Between the two versions of the film, the &quot;British&quot; version most prominently omits the final scene on the train. A two-disc DVD edition was released in 2004 containing both versions of the film, this time with the &quot;British&quot; version titled &quot;Preview Version&quot; (102:49 long) and the &quot;Hollywood&quot; version titled &quot;Final Release Version&quot; (100:40 long). The film was later made available on Blu-ray in 2012 with the same contents as the 2004 DVD edition.

==Legacy==
&quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; was adapted for the radio program &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; on two occasions: on December 3, 1951, with Ruth Roman, Frank Lovejoy and Ray Milland, and on April 12, 1954, with Virginia Mayo, Dana Andrews and Robert Cummings.

BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Afternoon Play&quot; broadcast on September 29, 2011, was &quot;Strangers on a Film&quot; by Stephen Wyatt, which gives an imagined account of a series of meetings between Hitchcock (Clive Swift) and Raymond Chandler (Patrick Stewart), as they unsuccessfully attempt to create the screenplay for &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot;.

The 1987 film &quot;Throw Momma from the Train&quot; by Danny DeVito was inspired by &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot;, which is also watched by DeVito&#x27;s character in the film.

A television film remake, &quot;Once You Meet a Stranger&quot;, was written and directed by Tommy Lee Wallace, and aired on CBS on September 25, 1996. The film switches the genders of the main characters from male to female, and stars Jacqueline Bisset and Theresa Russell.

The 2022 Netflix original &quot;Do Revenge&quot; has a plot inspired by &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot;. In the film, two classmates conspire to take down the other&#x27;s enemy as revenge.

In 2021, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In 2022, &quot;Time Out&quot; ranked the film at No. 75 on their list of &quot;The 100 best thriller films of all time&quot;.
