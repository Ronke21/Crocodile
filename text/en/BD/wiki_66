<text>In the USSR, during the eleven-year period from the death of Joseph Stalin (1953) to the political ouster of Nikita Khrushchev (1964), the national politics were dominated by the Cold War, including the U.S.–USSR struggle for the global spread of their respective socio-economic systems and ideology, and the defense of hegemonic spheres of influence. Since the mid-1950s, despite the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) having disowned Stalinism, the political culture of Stalinism — a very powerful General Secretary of the CPSU—remained in place, albeit weakened.

== Politics ==

=== Stalin&#x27;s immediate legacy ===
After Stalin died in March 1953, he was succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev as First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) and Georgy Malenkov as Premier of the Soviet Union. However the central figure in the immediate post-Stalin period was the former head of the state security apparatus, Lavrentiy Beria.

Stalin had left the Soviet Union in an unenviable state when he died. At least 2.5 million people languished in prison and in labor camps, science and the arts had been subjugated to socialist realism, and agriculture productivity on the whole was meager. The country had only one quarter of the livestock it had had in 1928 and in some areas, there were fewer animals than there had been at the start of World War I. Private plots accounted for at least one quarter of meat, dairy, and produce output. Living standards were low and consumer goods scarce. Moscow was also remarkably isolated and friendless on the international stage; Eastern Europe excluding Yugoslavia was held to the Soviet yoke by military occupation and soon after Stalin&#x27;s death, protests and revolts would break out in some Eastern Bloc countries. China paid homage to the departed Soviet leader, but held a series of grudges that would soon boil over.

=== Policy Innovations by Beria ===

==== Domestic policy ====
As Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union, Lavrentiy Beria (notwithstanding his record as part of Stalin&#x27;s terror state) initiated a period of relative liberalisation, including the release of some political prisoners. Almost as soon as Stalin was buried, Beria ordered Vyacheslav Molotov&#x27;s wife freed from imprisonment and personally delivered her to the Soviet foreign minister. He also directed the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) to reexamine the Doctors&#x27; Plot and other &quot;false&quot; cases. Beria next proposed stripping the MVD of some of its economic assets and transferring control of them to other ministries, followed by the proposal to stop using forced labour on construction projects. He then announced that 1.1 million non-political prisoners were to be freed from captivity, that the Ministry of Justice should assume control of labour camps from the MVD, and that the Doctors&#x27; Plot was false. Finally, he ordered a halt to physical and psychological abuse of prisoners. Beria also declared a halt to forced Russification of the Soviet republics; Beria himself was a Georgian.

The leadership also began allowing some criticism of Stalin, saying that his one-man dictatorship went against the principles laid down by Vladimir Lenin. The war hysteria that characterized his last years was toned down, and government bureaucrats and factory managers were allowed to wear civilian clothing instead of military-style outfits. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were given serious prospects of national autonomy, possibly similarly to other Soviet satellite states in Europe.

==== Foreign policy ====
Beria also turned his attention to foreign policy. A secret letter found among his papers after his death, suggested restoring relations with Titoist Yugoslavia. He also criticized Soviet handling of Eastern Europe and the numerous &quot;mini-Stalins&quot; such as Hungary&#x27;s Mátyás Rákosi. East Germany particularly was in a tenuous situation in 1953 as the attempt by its leader Walter Ulbricht to impose all-out Stalinism had cause a mass exodus of people to the West. Beria suggested that East Germany should just be forgotten about entirely and there was &quot;no purpose&quot; for its existence. He revived the proposal Stalin had made to the Allies in 1946 for the creation of a united, neutral Germany.

==== Opposition to Beria ====
Beria displayed a considerable degree of contempt for the rest of the Politburo, letting it be known that they were &quot;complicit&quot; in Stalin&#x27;s crimes. However, it was not deep-rooted ideological disagreements that turned them against Beria. Khrushchev in particular was appalled at the idea of abandoning East Germany and allowing the restoration of capitalism there, but that alone was not enough to plot Beria&#x27;s downfall and he even supported the new, more enlightened policy towards non-Russian nationalities. The Politburo soon began stonewalling Beria&#x27;s reforms and trying to prevent them from passing. One proposal, to reduce sentences handed down by the MVD to 10 years max, was later claimed by Khrushchev to be a ruse. &quot;He wants to be able to sentence people to ten years in the camps, and then when they&#x27;re freed, sentence them to another ten years. This is his way of grinding them down.&quot; Molotov was the strongest opponent of abandoning East Germany, and found in Khrushchev an unexpected ally.

By late June, it was decided that Beria could not simply be ignored or sidelined, he had to be taken out. They had him arrested on 26 June with the support of the armed forces. At the end of the year, he was shot following a show trial where he was accused of spying for the West, committing sabotage, and plotting to restore capitalism. The secret police were disarmed and reorganized into the KGB, ensuring that they were completely under the control of the party and would never again be able to wage mass terror.

=== Collective leadership ===

For a time after Beria&#x27;s deposition, Georgi Malenkov was generally considered the senior-most figure in the Politburo. Malenkov, an artistic-minded man who courted intellectuals and artists, had little use for bloodshed or state terror. He called for greater support of private agricultural plots and liberation of the arts from rigid socialist realism and he also criticized the pseudoscience of biologist Trofim Lysenko. In a November 1953 speech, Malenkov denounced corruption in various government agencies. He also reappraised Soviet views of the outside world and relations with the West, arguing that there were no disputes with the United States and her allies that could not be resolved peacefully, and that nuclear war with the West would simply bring about the destruction of all parties involved.

Within the same period, Nikita Khrushchev likewise emerged as a prominent figure in Soviet politics. Khrushchev proposed greater agricultural reforms, although he still refused to abandon the concept of collective farming and continued to support Lysenko&#x27;s pseudoscience. In a 1955 speech, he argued that Soviet agriculture needed a shot in the arm and that it was silly to keep blaming low productivity and failed harvests on Tsar Nicholas II, dead for almost 40 years. He also began allowing ordinary people to stroll the grounds of the Kremlin, which had been closed off except to high ranking state officials for over 20 years.

The late Stalin&#x27;s reputation meanwhile started diminishing. His 75th birthday in December 1954 had been marked by extensive eulogies and commemorations in the state media as was the second anniversary of his death in March 1955. However, his 76th birthday at the end of the year was hardly mentioned.

The new leadership declared a major amnesty for certain categories of convicts, announced price cuts, and relaxed the restrictions on private plots. De-Stalinisation would come to spell an end to the role of large-scale forced labour in the economy.

==== Conflict within the collective leadership ====
During the period of collective leadership, Khrushchev gradually rose to power while Malenkov&#x27;s power waned. Malenkov was criticised for his economic reform proposals and desire to reduce the CPSU&#x27;s direct involvement in the day-to-day running of the state. Molotov called his warning that nuclear war would end all of civilisation to be &quot;nonsense&quot; since according to Karl Marx, the collapse of capitalism was a historical inevitability. Khrushchev accused Malenkov of supporting Beria&#x27;s plan to abandon East Germany, and of being a &quot;capitulationist, social democrat, and a Menshevist&quot;.

Khrushchev was also headed for a showdown with Molotov, after having initially respected and left him alone in the immediate aftermath of Stalin&#x27;s death. Molotov began criticizing some of Khrushchev&#x27;s ideas and the latter accused him in turn of being an out-of-touch ideologue who never left his dacha or the Kremlin to visit farms or factories. Molotov attacked Khrushchev&#x27;s suggestions for agricultural reform and also his plans to construct cheap, prefab apartments to alleviate Moscow&#x27;s severe housing shortages. Khrushchev also endorsed restoring ties with Yugoslavia, the split with Belgrade having been heavily engineered by Molotov, who continued to denounce Tito as a fascist. A 1955 visit by Khrushchev to Yugoslavia patched up relations with that country, but Molotov refused to back down. The near-total isolation of the Soviet Union from the outside world was also blamed by Khrushchev on Molotov&#x27;s handling of foreign policy and the former admitted in a speech to the Central Committee the obvious Soviet complicity in starting the Korean War.

=== 20th Congress of the CPSU ===

At a closed session of the 20th Congress of the CPSU on 25 February 1956, Khrushchev shocked his listeners by denouncing Stalin&#x27;s dictatorial rule and cult of personality in a speech entitled &quot;On the Cult of Personality and its Consequences&quot;. He also attacked the crimes committed by Stalin&#x27;s closest associates. Furthermore, he stated that the orthodox view of war between the capitalist and communist worlds being inevitable was no longer true. He advocated competition with the West rather than outright hostility, stating that capitalism would decay from within and that world socialism would triumph peacefully. But, he added, if the capitalists did desire war, the Soviet Union would respond in kind.

=== De-Stalinisation ===

The impact of the 20th Congress on Soviet politics was immense. Khrushchev&#x27;s speech stripped the legitimacy of his remaining Stalinist rivals, dramatically boosting his power domestically. Afterwards, Khrushchev eased restrictions and freed over a million prisoners from the Gulag, leaving an estimated 1.5 million prisoners living in a semi-reformed prison system (though a wave of counter-reform followed in the 1960s). Communists around the world were shocked and confused by his condemnation of Stalin, and the speech &quot;...caused a veritable revolution (the word is not too strong) in peoples attitudes throughout the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. It was the single factor in breaking down the mixture of fear, fanaticism, naivety and &#x27;doublethink&#x27; with which everyone...had reacted to Communist rule&quot;.

==== Among Soviet intellectuals ====
Many Soviet intellectuals groused that Khrushchev and the rest of the Central Committee had willingly aided and abetted Stalin&#x27;s crimes and that the late tyrant could not possibly have done everything himself. Furthermore, they asked why it had taken three years to condemn him and noted that Khrushchev mostly criticised what had happened to fellow Party members while completely overlooking far greater atrocities such as the Holodomor and mass deportations from the Baltic States during and after World War II, none of which were allowed to be mentioned in the Soviet press until the end of the 1980s. During the Secret Speech, Khrushchev had tried in an awkward manner to explain why he and his colleagues had not raised their voices against Stalin by saying that they all feared their own destruction if they did not comply with his demands.

==== Pro-Stalin demonstrations ====

In Stalin&#x27;s native Georgia, massive crowds of pro-Stalin demonstrators rioted in the streets of Tbilisi and even demanded that Georgia secede from the USSR. Army troops had to be called in to restore order, with 20 deaths, 60 injuries, and scores of arrests.

==== Response from Soviet youth ====
In April 1956, there were reports that Stalin busts and portraits around the country had been vandalized or pulled down and some student groups rioted and demanded that Stalin be posthumously expelled from the party and his body taken down from its spot next to Lenin. Party and student meetings called for proper rule of law in the country and even free elections. A 25 year old Mikhail Gorbachev, then a member of the Komsomol in Stavropol reported that reaction to the Secret Speech was explosive and there were strong reactions between people, particularly, young, educated people, who supported it and hated Stalin, others who denounced it and still held the late tyrant in awe, and others who thought it was irrelevant compared to grassroots issues such as food and housing availability. The Presidium responded by issuing a resolution condemning &quot;anti-party&quot; and &quot;anti-Soviet&quot; slanderers and the April 7 &quot;Pravda&quot; reprinted an editorial from China&#x27;s &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; calling on party members to study Stalin&#x27;s teachings and honour his memory. A Central Committee meeting on 30 June issued a resolution criticising Stalin merely for &quot;serious errors&quot; and &quot;practicing a cult of personality&quot; but holding the Soviet system itself blameless.

==== International reception ====
Some of the communist world, in particular China, North Korea, and Albania, stridently rejected de-Stalinisation. An editorial in the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; argued that &quot;Stalin made some mistakes, but on the whole he was a good, honest Marxist and his positives outweighed the negatives.&quot; Mao Zedong had many quarrels with Stalin, but thought that condemning him undermined the entire legitimacy of world socialism; &quot;Stalin needed to be criticised, not killed&quot; he said.

==== Rehabilitation during this period ====
By late 1955, thousands of political prisoners had been freed, but Soviet prisons and labour camps still held around 800,000 inmates and no attempt was made to investigate the Moscow Trials or rehabilitate their victims. Eventually several hundred thousand of Stalin&#x27;s victims were rehabilitated, but the party officials purged in the Moscow Trials remained off the table. Khrushchev ordered an investigation into the trials of Mikhail Tukhachevsky and other army officers. The committee found that the charges leveled against them were baseless and their posthumous rehabilitation was announced in early 1957, but another investigation into the trials of Grigory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev, and Nikolai Bukharin declared that all three had engaged in &quot;anti-Soviet activity&quot; and would not be rehabilitated. After Khrushchev defeated the &quot;anti-party group&quot; in 1957, he promised to re-open the cases, but ultimately never did so, in part because of the embarrassing fact that he himself had celebrated the elimination of the Old Bolsheviks during the purges.

==== Changing toponymy ====
As part of de-Stalinisation, Khrushchev set about renaming the numerous towns, cities, factories, natural features, and kolkhozes around the country named in honor of Stalin and his aides, most notably Stalingrad, site of the great WWII battle, was renamed to Volgograd in 1961.

=== Khrushchev consolidates power ===

==== Defeat of the Anti-Party Group ====

In 1957, Khrushchev had defeated a concerted Stalinist attempt to recapture power, decisively defeating the so-called &quot;Anti-Party Group&quot;; this event illustrated the new nature of Soviet politics. The most decisive attack on the Stalinists was delivered by defense minister Georgy Zhukov, who and the implied threat to the plotters was clear; however, none of the &quot;anti-party group&quot; were killed or even arrested, and Khrushchev disposed of them quite cleverly: Georgy Malenkov was sent to manage a power station in Kazakhstan, and Vyacheslav Molotov, one of the most die-hard Stalinists, was made ambassador to Mongolia.

Eventually however, Molotov was reassigned to be the Soviet representative of the International Atomic Energy Commission in Vienna after the Kremlin decided to put some safe distance between him and China since Molotov was becoming increasingly cozy with the anti-Khrushchev Chinese Communist Party leadership. Molotov continued to attack Khrushchev every opportunity he got, and in 1960, on the occasion of Lenin&#x27;s 90th birthday, wrote a piece describing his personal memories of the Soviet founding father and thus implying that he was closer to the Marxist-Leninist orthodoxy. In 1961, just prior to the 22nd CPSU Congress, Molotov wrote a vociferous denunciation of Khrushchev&#x27;s party platform and was rewarded for this action with expulsion from the party.

Khrushchev&#x27;s attack on the &quot;anti-party group&quot; drew negative reactions from China; the People&#x27;s Daily remarked &quot;How can [Molotov], one of the founding fathers of the CPSU, be a member of an anti-party group?&quot;

Like Molotov, Foreign Minister Dmitri Shepilov also met the chopping block when he was sent to manage the Kirghizia Institute of Economics. Later, when he was appointed as a delegate to the Communist Party of Kirghizia conference, Khrushchev deputy Leonid Brezhnev intervened and ordered Shepilov dropped from the conference. He and his wife were evicted from their Moscow apartment and then reassigned to a smaller one that lay exposed to the fumes from a nearby food processing plant, and he was dropped from membership in the Soviet Academy of Sciences before being expelled from the party. Kliment Voroshilov held the ceremonial title of head of state despite his advancing age and declining health; he retired in 1960. Nikolai Bulganin ended up managing the Stavropol Economic Council. Also banished was Lazar Kaganovich, sent to manage a potash works in the Urals before being expelled from the party along with Molotov in 1962.

Despite his strong support for Khrushchev during the removal of Beria and the anti-party group, Zhukov was too popular and beloved of a figure for Khrushchev&#x27;s comfort, so he was removed as well. In addition, while leading the attack against Molotov, Malenkov, and Kaganovich, he also insinuated that Khrushchev himself had been complicit in the 1930s purges, which in fact he had. While Zhukov was on a visit to Albania in October 1957, Khrushchev plotted his downfall. When Zhukov returned to Moscow, he was promptly accused of trying to remove the Soviet military from party control, creating a cult of personality around himself, and of plotting to seize power in a coup. Several Soviet generals went on to accuse Zhukov of &quot;egomania&quot;, &quot;shameless self-aggrandizement&quot;, and of tyrannical behaviour during WWII. Zhukov was expelled from his post as defense minister and forced into retirement from the military on the grounds of his &quot;advanced age&quot; (he was 62). Marshal Rodin Malinovsky took Zhukov&#x27;s place as defense minister.

==== Election to Premiership ====
Khrushchev was elected Premier on 27 March 1958, consolidating his power—the tradition followed by all his predecessors and successors. This was the final stage in the transition from the earlier period of post-Stalin collective leadership. He was now the ultimate source of authority in the Soviet Union, but would never possess the absolute power Stalin had.

=== 21st Congress of the CPSU ===

In 1959, between 27 January and 5 February, the 21st Congress of the CPSU took place; it was an &quot;Extraordinary&quot; Congress, timed so that Khrushchev could consolidate his power over rivals not long after the attempted coup of the &quot;anti-party group&quot; in 1957. It was during this congress that the unusual Seven-Year Plan was adopted, cutting short and replacing the Sixth Five-Year Plan that had been adopted in 1956. The Seven-Year Plan would itself be cut short two years before its completion, retroactively becoming the seventh five-year plan.

=== 22nd Congress of the CPSU ===

The 22nd Congress of the CPSU, which convened from 17–21 October 1961, marked the apex of Khrushchev&#x27;s power and prestige, despite there being already mounting doubts about his policies. However, the real opposition to him had yet to come and he glowed in the praise of the CPSU delegates as he read off the general report of the Central Committee and the party program, two monumental speeches that lasted a total of ten hours. Within a decade, Khrushchev declared, the Soviet people would have equal living standards and material comforts with the United States and Western Europe. In addition, the 22nd Congress saw a renewed attack on Stalin, which culminated in the expulsion of remaining Old Bolsheviks like Molotov and Kaganovich from the party. Stalin&#x27;s embalmed body, which still lay in Red Square next to Lenin, was immediately removed and reburied in the Kremlin Wall.

=== Khrushchev voted out of office ===
In October 1964, while Khrushchev was on holiday in Crimea, the Presidium unanimously voted him out of office and refused to permit him to take his case to the Central Committee. He retired as a private citizen after an editorial in Pravda denounced him for &quot;hare-brained schemes, half−baked conclusions, hasty decisions, and actions divorced from reality&quot;.

== Reforms during Khrushchev&#x27;s administration ==
Throughout his years of leadership, Khrushchev oversaw attempted reforms in a range of fields.

=== Khrushchev Thaw ===

Khrushchev initiated &quot;The Thaw&quot;, a complex shift in political, cultural, and economic life in the Soviet Union. That included some openness and contact with other countries and new social and economic policies with more emphasis on commodity goods, allowing living standards to rise dramatically while maintaining high levels of economic growth. Censorship was relaxed as well. Some subtle critiques of the Soviet society were tolerated, and artists were not expected to produce only works which had government-approved political context. Still, artists, most of whom were proud of both the country and the Party, were careful not to get into trouble. However, he reintroduced aggressive anti-religious campaigns, closing down many houses of worship.

==== Impact on the Eastern Bloc ====
Such loosening of controls also caused an enormous impact on other socialist countries in Central Europe, many of which were resentful of Soviet influence in their affairs. Riots broke out in Poland in the summer of 1956, which led to reprisals from national forces there. A political convulsion soon followed, leading to the rise of Władysław Gomułka to power in October. This almost triggered a Soviet invasion when Polish Communists elected him without consulting the Kremlin in advance, but in the end, Khrushchev backed down due to Gomułka&#x27;s widespread popularity in the country. Poland would still remain a member of the Warsaw Pact (established a year earlier), and in return, the Soviet Union seldom intervened in its neighbors&#x27; domestic and external affairs. Khrushchev also began reaching out to newly independent countries in Asia and Africa, which was in sharp contrast to Stalin&#x27;s Europe-centered foreign policy. And in September 1959, he became the first Soviet leader to visit the US.

In November 1956, the Hungarian Revolution was brutally suppressed by Soviet troops. About 2,500–3,000 Hungarian insurgents and 700 Soviet troops were killed, thousands more were wounded, and nearly a quarter million left the country as refugees. The Hungarian uprising was a blow to Western communists; many who had formerly supported the Soviet Union began to criticize it in the wake of the Soviet suppression of the Hungarian uprising.

=== Agriculture ===

Back in the early 1950s, Khrushchev had defended private plots as part of the collective leadership, which had introduced important innovations in the area of Soviet agriculture. It had encouraged peasants to grow more on their private plots, increased payments for crops grown on collective farms, and invested more heavily in agriculture.

However, beginning in the late 1950s, Khrushchev spoke of communal farming as inevitable. After Khrushchev had defeated his rivals and secured his position, he set his attention to economic reforms, particularly in the field of agriculture. &quot;If a capitalist farmer required eight kilos of grain to produce one kilo of meat,&quot; he told a farmers&#x27; council, &quot;he would lose his pants. Yet if a state farm director here does the same, he manages to keep his pants. Why? Because no one will hold him accountable for it&quot;.

Khrushchev&#x27;s administration abolished the Machine Tractor Stations, which were rural agencies to provide farming equipment, and had them sell their inventory directly to the farmers, but the latter ended up incurring huge debts buying the farming equipment, which ended up being used less effectively than the MTS had done.

==== American farming techniques and maize ====
Khrushchev continued to believe in the theories of the biologist Trofim Lysenko, a carryover from the Stalin era, however, the Soviet leader looked to his country&#x27;s greatest rival for inspiration. As far back as the 1940s, he had promoted the use of American farming techniques and even obtained seeds from the US, in particular from a cagey Iowa farmer named Roswell Garst, who believed positive trade and business relations with Moscow would ease superpower tensions. This led to Khrushchev&#x27;s soon to be notorious fascination with growing maize, although most of the Soviet Union outside of Ukraine lacked a suitable climate and much of the infrastructure used by American farmers, including adequate mechanized equipment, knowledge of advanced farming techniques, and proper use of fertilizer and pesticides, was in short supply. Although Khrushchev&#x27;s corn obsession was exaggerated by popular myth, he did nonetheless advocate any number of unrealistic ideas such as planting corn in Siberia.

==== Virgin Lands Campaign ====

During the Virgin Lands Campaign in the mid-1950s, many tracts of land were opened to farming in Kazakhstan and neighbouring areas of Russia. These new farmlands turned out to be susceptible to droughts, but in some years they produced excellent harvests. Later agricultural reforms by Khrushchev, however, proved counterproductive. His plans for growing corn and increasing meat and dairy production failed, and his reorganisation of collective farms into larger units produced confusion in the countryside.

=== Industry ===
In a politically motivated move to weaken the central state bureaucracy in 1957, Khrushchev did away with the industrial ministries in Moscow and replaced them with regional economic councils (sovnarkhozes).

Although he intended these economic councils to be more responsive to local needs, the decentralisation of industry led to disruption and inefficiency. Connected with this decentralisation was Khrushchev&#x27;s decision in 1962 to recast party organisations along economic, rather than administrative, lines. The resulting bifurcation of the party apparatus into industrial and agricultural sectors at the oblast (province) level and below contributed to the disarray and alienated many party officials at all levels. Symptomatic of the country&#x27;s economic difficulties was the abandonment in 1963 of Khrushchev&#x27;s special seven-year economic plan (1959–65) two years short of its completion.

=== Military ===

Khrushchev significantly reduced Soviet defense spending and the size of conventional forces, accusing the army of being &quot;metal eaters&quot; and &quot;If you let the army have their way, they will eat up the country&#x27;s entire resources and still claim it&#x27;s not enough.&quot; Several warships under construction were scrapped as Khrushchev considered them useless, as well as plans for long range bombers. Orders for fighter planes slowed and several military airfields were converted to civilian use. Although he alienated the Soviet military establishment, he insisted that the country could not match the United States for conventional military capabilities and that the nuclear arsenal was sufficient deterrence. There were also practical reasons for this stance as the low birth rate of the 1940s caused a shortage of military-aged men.

The size of the Soviet military was reduced by nearly 2 million men in 1955–57, and further cuts followed in 1958 and 1960. These cuts in troop strength were not well planned out and many soldiers and officers were left jobless and homeless. Discontent in the military started building up.

Despite Khrushchev&#x27;s boasts about Soviet missile capabilities, they were mostly bluster. The R-7 ICBM used to launch Sputnik was almost useless as a workable ICBM and Soviet missiles were launched from above-ground surface pads which were completely exposed to enemy attack. When Khrushchev suggested putting them in underground silos, Soviet rocket engineers argued that it could not be done until he stumbled across an article in an American technical journal describing the use of silos to house missiles. He admonished the rocket engineers for failing to pay attention to American technical developments and when the first Soviet silo launch took place in September 1959, Khrushchev took it as a personal triumph.

=== Science and technology ===

Aid to developing countries and scientific research, especially into space technology and weaponry, maintained the Soviet Union as one of the world&#x27;s two major world powers. The Soviet Union launched the first ever artificial Earth satellite in history, Sputnik 1, which orbited the Earth in 1957. The Soviets also sent the first man into space, Yuri Gagarin, in 1961.

== Foreign relations ==

=== Yugoslavia and the Eastern Bloc===

Khrushchev attempted to restore relations with Tito&#x27;s Yugoslavia with a visit to Belgrade in May 1955, however the Yugoslavian leader was unmoved by an attempt by Khrushchev to blame Beria for the break with Yugoslavia. Khrushchev persisted and began urging the Eastern European bloc to restore ties with Yugoslavia. He also disbanded the Cominform, used as a club to beat Belgrade over the head with. The trip was reciprocated by a visit of Josip Broz Tito to Moscow in May 1956 where he was given a regal welcome and immense crowds dispatched to greet him. The Politburo members attempted to outdo each other in courting Tito and apologizing for Stalin, but the visit had no ultimate effect on Tito&#x27;s foreign policy stance and he still refused to join the Soviet bloc, abandon his nonaligned stance, or cut off economic and military ties with the West. Worse than that, Tito began offering his nonaligned socialism to other countries, in particular Poland and Hungary.

After Hungarian leader Imre Nagy briefly took refuge in the Yugoslavian embassy in Budapest during the events of October 1956, Tito stayed aloof from the Soviet suppression of the Hungarian revolt and Soviet-Yugoslav relations waned from that point onward. Tito declined to attend the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution in November 1957 and continued to actively promote his nonaligned stance at the Yugoslavian Communist Party&#x27;s congress the following March. Khrushchev refused to send any delegates to the congress and authorized a lengthy denunciation of it in &quot;Pravda&quot;. Accusing Tito of being a traitor similar to Imre Nagy, Khrushchev ordered the execution of the Hungarian leader, who had been incarcerated for the last several months.

The uprisings in Poland and Hungary during 1956, which coincided with a softening of Khrushchev&#x27;s anti-Stalin course (he told guests in a reception at the Chinese embassy in Moscow that &quot;Stalinism is inseparable from Marxism&quot;) brought about renewed protests from various elements of Soviet society. Aside from the usual complaints from intellectuals, there were student demonstrations and reports of portraits of Soviet leaders in factories being vandalized or torn down. Despite the small scale of this public dissent, the Central Committee quickly approved harsh countermeasures and several hundred people were arrested during early 1957 and sentenced to several years in labour camps.

==== East Germany ====

East Germany continued to be a sticky situation. Khrushchev had initially hoped to obtain recognition for the GDR from the Western powers, but ended up making things worse. A mass exodus of GDR citizens to West Germany, mostly young, fit adults, continued unabated, which left the GDR&#x27;s labour force drained of manpower. GDR leader Walter Ulbricht requested the use of Soviet guest workers to make up for labour shortages, a proposal that alarmed Khrushchev as it drew reminders of the use of Soviet slave labourers by Nazi Germany during WWII. On top of this, West German citizens were traveling to the East to buy low cost goods subsidized by Moscow, further increasing the amount of debt money the GDR owed to the USSR.

The problem of signing a peace treaty with West Germany loomed large and posed nearly insurmountable issues. Signing a peace treaty would likely result in an economic embargo of the GDR by West Germany which would require a twofold increase in Soviet assistance, something Moscow could ill afford.

=== China ===

Khrushchev ran afoul of China when he proposed a joint Sino-Soviet fleet in the Pacific to counter the US Seventh Fleet. Soviet ambassador to China Pavel Yudin was rebuffed by Mao Zedong in a July 1958 meeting. Mao demanded to talk to Khrushchev in person, so the latter obliged and flew to Beijing. The meeting proved no more successful than the previous one with Yudin and Mao continued to reject the idea of a joint fleet, allowing Soviet Navy warships to dock at Chinese ports in peacetime, and operating joint radar stations as an infringement on Chinese sovereignty. Shortly after Khrushchev went home, the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army shelled the islands of Kinmen (Quemoy) and Matsu in the Formosa Strait, provoking the US Seventh Fleet to the area in a major show of force. Moscow supported the Chinese shelling of the islands with reluctance and after American threats of force on China, Mao told an appalled Andrei Gromyko that he was more than willing to start a nuclear war with the imperialist powers.

After this, Sino-Soviet relations calmed during the next six months only to worsen again during the summer of 1959 when Khrushchev criticized the Great Leap Forward and remained noncommittal during a Chinese border clash with India. On 20 August, Moscow informed Beijing that they would not give them a proposed sample atomic bomb. When Khrushchev headed to Beijing in late September, just after his US trip, he was given an icy reception and further alienated the Chinese with his warm accounts of Americans and of Eisenhower. A suggestion by the Soviet premier to free American pilots captured by China during the Korean War was rejected as well as Beijing&#x27;s recent actions in the Formosa Strait and the Indian border. The talks ended after only three days and Khrushchev went home despondent.

=== United States ===
==== Khrushchev visits the US ====
In September 1959, Khrushchev became the first Russian head of state to visit the United States. This groundbreaking trip was made on the new Tu-114 long range airliner despite still being an experimental aircraft, since the Soviet Union did not have any other plane capable of nonstop trans-Atlantic travel. The 13 day trip included meetings with American businessmen and labour leaders, Hollywood actors, and Roswell Garst&#x27;s farm in Iowa. Khrushchev became openly dismayed when he was told he could not visit Disneyland because it was too difficult to guarantee his security there.

==== 1960 US presidential election ====
Khrushchev anxiously awaited the results of the 1960 United States presidential election, preferring Kennedy to Richard Nixon, whom he took as a hardline anti-communist cold warrior, and openly celebrated the former&#x27;s victory on November 8. In truth however, Khrushchev&#x27;s opinion of Kennedy was mixed. He knew that the new president was from a wealthy background and Harvard-educated. On the other, Kennedy was the youngest elected US president at 43 and gave off the impression of inexperience and &quot;a boy wearing his father&#x27;s pants&quot; that Khrushchev assumed he could pounce on and dominate. If however Kennedy was that weak, there stood the possibility that he could merely be a puppet of &quot;reactionary&quot; forces and the US military-industrial complex. Almost immediately after the polls closed on Election Day, Khrushchev attempted to barrage the president-elect with proposals and the hope of improved US-Soviet relations, specifically turning the clock back to the accommodating diplomatic atmosphere of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s time. However, Khrushchev was informed that he was acting too quickly and it would not be possible to have a formal summit with Kennedy until he took office in January, and even then, arranging such a meeting would still take time.

==== Kennedy-era ====
Khrushchev was pleased by Kennedy&#x27;s inaugural address on 20 January 1961 and immediately offered to release American pilots shot down over the Soviet Union as an olive branch. Kennedy in his turn ordered a halt to US Postal Service censorship of Soviet publications, lifted a ban on the importation of Soviet crab meat, and ordered military officials to tone down anti-Soviet rhetoric in speeches.

In a report on January 6 concerning a world conference of 81 communist parties in Moscow the previous fall, Khrushchev stated that the triumph of socialism over capitalism was inevitable, but at the same time, a major conflict between the great powers on the scale of the two world wars was now unthinkable in the age of nuclear weapons. He also stated that local wars must be avoided, for they could erupt into major ones as had been the case with World War I. The only acceptable conflicts as Khrushchev saw it were anti-colonial wars of national liberation along the lines of Algeria&#x27;s war of independence against France.

Although Eisenhower would have likely dismissed this speech as so much Soviet bluster, the inexperienced Kennedy became nervous and took it as a call to arms by Moscow. In his first State of the Union address on 30 January, he cautioned that &quot;No one should think that either the Soviet Union or China has given up their desire for world domination, ambitions they forcefully restated only a short time ago. On the contrary, our aim is to show that aggression and subversion on their part is not an acceptable means to achieve these aims.&quot; These remarks were followed two days later by the first test launch of a Minuteman ICBM.

Khrushchev&#x27;s initial hopes for Kennedy gradually dimmed during the next few months. When Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba was assassinated, Khrushchev blamed it on Western colonialist forces. Khrushchev&#x27;s boasts about Soviet missile forces provided John F. Kennedy with a key issue to use against Richard Nixon in the 1960 U.S. presidential election—the so-called &#x27;missile gap&#x27;. But all Khrushchev&#x27;s (probably sincere) attempts to build a strong personal relationship with the new president failed, as his typical combination of bluster, miscalculation and mishap resulted in the Cuban Missile Crises. After the Berlin and Cuba crises, tensions tapered off between the two superpowers.

Khrushchev openly wept at the news of Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in November 1963 and feared that new US president Lyndon Johnson would pursue a more aggressive anti-Soviet stance. Johnson turned out to be more in favor of détente than Khrushchev had assumed, but would end up letting superpower relations take a backseat to his Great Society programs and the Vietnam War.

=== During 1953-1955 ===

Since Stalin&#x27;s death, Soviet agricultural output had improved measurably—gains in meat, dairy, and grain output were in the area of 130-150%, which led to Khrushchev making overconfident target dates for overtaking American farm production that eventually became a subject of derision.

=== During 1956-1958 ===

Alexsei Larionov, local party leader in Ryazan, attempted to triple meat production in the province after overall Soviet meat output for 1958 had been lacking (the grain harvest for comparison had been a strong one). The scheme, which was similar in nature to China&#x27;s contemporary Great Leap Forward, involved setting unrealistic quotas and frantically slaughtering every animal in the province, including dairy cows and breeding stock, in an attempt to meet them. When the quotas still could not be met, Ryazan farmers tried to steal livestock from neighboring provinces, which took measures to protect their own farms such as police roadblocks. The Ryazan farmers resorted to theft of cattle under cover of darkness and Larionov, growing ever more desperate, made taxes payable in meat. In the end, Ryazan produced just 30,000 tons of meat for 1959, when they had promised 180,000 tons. The disgraced Larionov committed suicide shortly thereafter.

=== During 1959-1964 ===
The harvest for 1960 proved the worst since Stalin&#x27;s death, and the Virgin Lands were especially disappointing. During the fall and winter of 1960–61, Khrushchev embarked on a furious campaign to improve agricultural shortcomings, most of which amounted to criticizing incompetent &quot;kolkhoz&quot; managers and promoting Lysenkoism and other quack scientific ideas while overlooking the real problem, which was the fundamental defects of collectivized agriculture.

The harvest for 1961 was disappointing, with agricultural output a mere 0.7% higher than 1960 and meat production actually less than the previous two years. Discontent began building, and in the face of it, Khrushchev continued to offer new proposals to improve farm output and condemnation of inefficient farming practices. Despite complaints from farmers that they lacked enough funding for tools and farm equipment, Khrushchev argued that he had no spare money to allot to agriculture. His only solution was to add yet more bureaucracy to the agricultural sector.

Price increases of meat and dairy in the spring of 1962, combined with attempts to convince industrial workers to work harder for the same or less pay, paved the way for a mounting disaster. The price increases went into effect on 1 June and were immediately greeted by strikes and demonstrations in several cities, the biggest and most cataclysmic in the city of Novocherkassk where workers went on strike to protest rising costs of living and poor workplace conditions. The following day, workers at the Budenny Electric Locomotive Factory marched to the central square of the city where army units fired on them, killing 23. Another 116 demonstrators were arrested, with 14 tried for &quot;anti-Soviet agitation&quot; and seven of them sentenced to death. The other seven received 10–15 years in prison. Smaller riots in other cities were also put down with several fatalities. Khrushchev made a speech the same day half-apologizing for the price increases, but insisted that he had no choice. He never fully came to terms with the Novocherkassk massacre and did not bring it up in his memoirs.

During 1963, Khrushchev increasingly despaired over his inability to cure the perennial ailments of Soviet agriculture. He accused farmers of needlessly wasting fertilizer, adding that a farmer in the United States would be out of business if he did the same and he also complained about aging &quot;kolkhoz&quot; managers who should have retired and made way for younger men, but continued to hold onto their jobs. Drought affected a large portion of the west-central USSR during the fall months and overall the 1963 harvest was an abject failure with a mere 107 million tons of grain produced and there was serious consideration given to rationing. Khrushchev could offer no solutions other than empty sloganeering and criticizing incompetent managers. After initially bristling at the idea of importing grain from overseas, he finally gave in after learning that Soviet grain stocks were almost depleted.

<text>Red Dawn is a 1984 American action drama film directed by John Milius with a screenplay by Milius and Kevin Reynolds. The film depicts a fictional World War III centering on a military invasion of the United States by an alliance of Soviet, Warsaw Pact, and Communist Latin American states. The story follows a group of teenage guerrillas, known as the Wolverines, in Soviet-occupied Colorado. The film stars Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey, with supporting roles played by Ben Johnson, Darren Dalton, Harry Dean Stanton, Ron O&#x27;Neal, William Smith and Powers Boothe.

Despite mixed reviews from critics, the film became a commercial success, grossing $38 million against a budget of $17 million. It was the first film to be released in the U.S. with a PG-13 rating under the modified rating system introduced on July 1, 1984. A remake was released in 2012.

== Plot ==
In the 1980s, the United States becomes increasingly isolated after a green political party gains power in West Germany and successfully persuades Western Europe to remove its nuclear weapons. Subsequently, NATO dissolves. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union is devastated by a failed wheat harvest and invades Poland to suppress food and labor riots. Soviet allies Cuba and Nicaragua build up their military strength while El Salvador and Honduras fall under Soviet influence and a communist coup d&#x27;état seizes control in Mexico.

In the town of Calumet, Colorado, a high school class is interrupted by a Soviet-led invasion. Some students, including brothers Jed and Matt Eckert, escape the chaos as Soviet paratroopers attack. Combined Soviet, Cuban and Nicaraguan soldiers then occupy Calumet. Jed, Matt, and their friends Robert, Danny, Daryl, and Arturo flee into the countryside after procuring supplies and weapons from a store run by Robert&#x27;s father. When they encounter a Soviet roadblock, they are saved by a U.S. helicopter gunship. After several weeks hiding in the forests, the group learns that Mr. Eckert is held at a re-education camp at Calumet&#x27;s drive-in. Visiting the camp, they speak to him through a fence and learn that Mrs. Eckert is dead; he tells the group to avenge him.

The group visits the Mason family in occupied territory and learns that the occupiers executed Robert&#x27;s father. The Masons ask Jed and Matt to care for their granddaughters, Toni and Erica. The group begins launching guerilla attacks on the occupational forces, calling themselves the &quot;Wolverines&quot; after their high school mascot. The occupiers respond with brutal crackdowns, resulting in the executions of Mr. Eckert and Arturo&#x27;s father, but the Wolverines are undeterred. They meet crashed USAF pilot Andrew Tanner, who informs them of the current state of the war: several American cities, including Washington D.C., were destroyed by nuclear strikes, Strategic Air Command was crippled by Cuban saboteurs, and paratroopers were dropped from commercial airliners to seize key positions in preparation for the main assaults via Mexico and Alaska. Most of the southwestern United States and Northwestern Canada were occupied by the Soviets, but American counterattacks halted their advances between the Rocky Mountains and the Mississippi River. Europe has decided to remain neutral. America&#x27;s only remaining foreign allies—China and the United Kingdom—remain active against the Soviets but are militarily crippled.

Tanner assists the Wolverines in their guerrilla operations, which leads to increased reprisals by occupational forces against civilians. Visiting the front lines of the war, Tanner and Arturo are killed in the crossfire of a tank battle between Soviet and U.S. forces. The Soviets bring in Colonel Strelnikov, a brutal Spetsnaz commander, and his men to track down the Wolverines. Daryl is arrested by the KGB after his father betrays him. They force him to swallow a tracking device and release him to rejoin the Wolverines. Soviet troops track the group to the forests using radio triangulation equipment but are ambushed by the Wolverines, who trace the source of the signal to Daryl; confessing the truth, he pleads for mercy but is shot dead by Robert.

Shortly thereafter, the remaining Wolverines are ambushed by Soviet helicopter gunships, which kill Toni and Robert. Jed and Matt decide to attack the occupational forces in Calumet to distract them while Danny and Erica escape. The plan works, but Matt is shot by Strelnikov. Jed and Strelnikov fire at each other at the same time. Strelnikov dies and Jed is injured. They are discovered by Cuban Colonel Ernesto Bella, who, completely disillusioned with both the war and Soviet ideology (seeing it as a lost cause), lets them go; the brothers sit on a park bench together, where they presumably bleed to death. Danny and Erica trek through the mountains and reach American-held territory.

In the closing scene, a plaque is shown in the mountains. It is fenced off, and a U.S. flag flies nearby, confirming that the U.S. ultimately won the war. The plaque states that: In the early days of World War III, guerrillas, mostly children, placed the names of their lost upon this rock. They fought here alone and gave up their lives, so &quot;that this nation shall not perish from the earth.&quot;

==Cast==
== Production ==
=== &quot;Ten Soldiers&quot; ===
Originally called &quot;Ten Soldiers,&quot; the script was written by Kevin Reynolds. Producer Barry Beckerman read it, and, in the words of Peter Bart, &quot;thought it had the potential to become a tough, taut, &#x27;art&#x27; picture made on a modest budget that could possibly break out to find a wider audience.&quot; His father Sidney Beckerman helped him pay a $5,000 option. Reynolds wanted to direct but the Beckermans wanted someone more established. Walter Hill briefly considered the script before turning it down, as did several other directors.

The Beckermans pitched the project to David Begelman at MGM, but were turned down. They tried again at that studio when it was run by Frank Yablans. Senior vice-president for production Peter Bart, who remembers it as a &quot;sharply written anti-war movie ... a sort of &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;&quot;, took the project to Yablans.

The script&#x27;s chances increased when Reynolds became mentored by Steven Spielberg, who helped him make &quot;Fandango&quot;; the script was eventually purchased by MGM.

=== John Milius ===
Bart recalls that things changed when &quot;the chieftains at MGM got a better idea. Instead of making a poignant little antiwar movie, why not make a teen &quot;Rambo&quot; and turn the project over to John Milius, a genial filmmaker who loved war movies. The idea was especially popular with a member of the MGM board of directors, General Alexander Haig, the former Nixon chief of staff, who yearned to supervise the film personally and develop a movie career.&quot;

Bart says most of MGM&#x27;s executives, except for Yablans, were opposed to Milius directing. Bart claims he made a last minute attempt to get Reynolds to direct the film and went to see Spielberg. However, by this stage &quot;Fandango&quot; was in rough cut, and Bart sensed that Spielberg was disappointed in the film and would not speak up for Reynolds. Milius was signed to direct at a fee of $1.25 million, plus a gun of his choice.

Milius set about rewriting the script. He and Haig devised a backstory in which the circumstances of the invasion would occur; this was reportedly based on Hitler&#x27;s proposed plans to invade the U.S. during World War II. Haig took Milius under his wing, bringing him to the Hudson Institute, the conservative think tank founded by Herman Kahn, to develop a plausible scenario. Milius saw the story as a Third World liberation struggle in reverse; Haig introduced Nicaragua and suggested that, with the collapse of NATO, a left-wing Mexican government would participate in the Soviet invasion, effectively splitting the U.S. in half. Bart says, &quot;Even Milius was taken aback by Haig&#x27;s approach to the project. &#x27;This is going to end up as a jingoistic, flag-waving movie,&#x27; Milius fretted. As a result, the budget of this once $6 million movie almost tripled.&quot;

Other changes included a shift in focus from conflict within the group to conflict between the teens and their oppressors, and the acceleration of the ages of some of the characters from early teens to high school age and beyond. There was also the addition of a sequence where some children visit a camp to find their parents have been brainwashed.

Milius later said, &quot;I see this as an anti-war movie in the sense that if both sides could see this, maybe it wouldn&#x27;t have to happen. I think it would be good for Americans to see what a war would be like. The film isn&#x27;t even that violent – the war shows none of the horrors that could happen in World War III. In fact, everything that happened in the movie happened in World War II.&quot;

Bart says Yablans pushed through filming faster than Milius wanted because MGM needed a movie over the summer. Milius wanted more time to plan, including devising futuristic weaponry and to not shoot over winter, but had to accede.

=== Casting ===
Milius wanted Robert Blake to play the US pilot but Frank Yablans overruled him. Powers Boothe was selected instead.

=== Filming ===
The movie was filmed in and around the city of Las Vegas, New Mexico. Many of the buildings and structures which appear in the film, including a historic Fred Harvey Company hotel adjacent to the train depot, the train yard, and a building near downtown, which was repainted with the name of &quot;Calumet, Colorado&quot;, referencing the town in Michigan, are still there today. An old Safeway grocery store was converted to a sound stage and used for several scenes in the movie.

Before starting work on the movie, the cast underwent an intensive eight-week military training course. During that time, production crews designed and built special combat vehicles in Newhall, California. &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; reported that the movie&#x27;s T-72 tank was such a precise replica that &quot;while it was being carted around Los Angeles, two CIA intelligence officers followed it to the studio and wanted to know where it had come from&quot;.

Powers Boothe later claimed that &quot;Milius cut out the emotional life of its characters. Originally, my character was anti-war, as well as a rightist. I was supposed to be the voice of reason in that movie. But certain cuts negated my character.&quot;

Lea Thompson said the original cut featured a love scene between her and Powers Boothe but it &quot;was cut out after some previews because of the age difference. And that was the main reason I took the movie—it was such a terrific scene.&quot; Similarly, a sex scene that took place in a sleeping bed was scripted between the characters Jed and Toni, but was abandoned after a failed take. Jennifer Grey stated this was because Patrick Swayze was drunk and couldn&#x27;t remember his lines while filming, while Grey was high on marijuana, stating &quot;And then it got cut. And they said, &#x27;We&#x27;ll come back and reshoot it.&#x27; But of course they didn&#x27;t.&quot; Her negative interaction with Swayze made her anxious about working with the actor again in &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;.

Some of the weaponry devised for the film did not work. Futuristic helicopters created for the film did not have FAA approval to fly over people.

The budget increased from $11 million to $15 million. It ultimately cost $19 million.

=== Music ===
The film&#x27;s score was composed and conducted by Basil Poledouris; it was the first soundtrack album to be released (on LP and compact disc) by Intrada Records. The label issued the complete score in 2007.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Red Dawn&quot; was the 20th highest-grossing film of 1984, opening on August 10, 1984, in 1,822 theaters and taking in $8,230,381 on its first weekend. Its box office gross is $38,376,497.

=== Critical reaction ===
&quot;Red Dawn&quot; received mixed reviews, receiving a &quot;Rotten&quot; 48% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;An appealing ensemble of young stars will have some audiences rooting for the Wolverines, but &quot;Red Dawn&quot;″s self-seriousness can never conceal the silliness of its alarmist concept.&quot;

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;Red Dawn&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;&quot;Red Dawn&quot; [...] is a self-congratulatory little B-picture, the sort America does so well. Set in the early months of World War Three, it&#x27;s a loving chronicle of juvenile heroism in Russian-occupied Colorado. Schoolkids caught behind enemy lines become crack guerillas overnight. Slaughter nobly, die even more so. Nice scenery, shame about the movie.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer Janet Maslin said, &quot;To any sniveling lily-livers who suppose that John Milius ... has already reached the pinnacle of movie-making machismo, a warning: Mr. Milius&#x27;s &quot;Red Dawn&quot; is more rip-roaring than anything he has done before. Here is Mr. Milius at his most alarming, delivering a rootin&#x27;-tootin&#x27; scenario for World War III.&quot;

MGM apologized to Alaska war veterans for the film&#x27;s advertising, which claimed that no foreign troops had ever landed on U.S. soil, overlooking the Aleutian Islands campaign of World War II, where Japanese soldiers occupied the Aleutian Islands, part of the Territory of Alaska.

At the time it was released, &quot;Red Dawn&quot; was considered the most violent film by the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; and the National Coalition on Television Violence, with a rate of 134 acts of violence per hour, or 2.23 per minute. The 2007 DVD Special Edition includes an on-screen &quot;Carnage Counter&quot; in a nod to this.

A few days after the NCTV survey came out, 35 protestors picketed the MGM/UA building in opposition to the film. John Milius said:
What these people really don&#x27;t like is that the movie shows violence being perpetrated against Russian and Cuban invaders, which is what the demonstration was all about. My question is, where were all these demonstrators when the Russians shot down that airliner? Were they cheering? And what about the people being gassed and yellow-rained in Afghanistan? ... There&#x27;s really no pleasure in outraging these people. I suppose next some extreme right-wing organization will give me an award, which is equally ridiculous.United States President Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy Reagan were reported to have watched and enjoyed the film during his presidency.

=== Later reputation ===
&quot;National Review Online&quot; has named the film No. 15 in its list of the &quot;Best Conservative Movies.&quot; Adam Arseneau at the website DVD Verdict opined that the film &quot;often feels like a Republican wet dream manifested into a surrealistic Orwellian nightmare&quot;.

According to Jesse Walker of &quot;Reason&quot;,
Libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard argued that the film was &quot;not so much pro-war as it is anti-state.&quot; Rothbard gave the film a generally positive review, while expressing some reservations with the story:

Ed Power writes for &quot;The Independent&quot;,

Writing for Foreign Policy, Antonio De Loera-Brust instead suggested that Red Dawn was meant as a critique of American foreign policy, describing the film&#x27;s core message as &quot;that those under occupation have the right to fight back.&quot; Describing it as &quot;a profoundly anti-war and anti-imperialist film&quot;, De Loera-Brust proposed that the film asked Americans &quot;How would you like it if somebody did that to you?&quot; in reference to the American invasions of other nations, and stated the Wolverines &quot;stand in for any teenagers from any land who have taken up arms against a foreign invader, from the Ukrainian partisans of World War II to the Palestinian kids throwing rocks at Israeli tanks.&quot;

=== Home media ===
&quot;Red Dawn&quot; has been variously released across a variety of formats.

== References in the film ==
The movie being shown to American prisoners at the re-education camp is Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; (1938).

Much of the story is set in the Arapaho National Forest, and a group of Soviet soldiers refer to the Colorado War, which was fought there between the Arapaho and Cheyenne tribes and the U.S. government.

During one scene, the young freedom fighters sit and listen to a radio playing messages meant for guerrillas behind the lines. The message played, &quot;John has a long mustache.&quot;, is one of the messages that was used before D-Day in Normandy to signal French partisans of the imminent invasion. The broadcast of this message is dramatized in the 1962 film The Longest Day.

== Operation Red Dawn ==

The operation to capture former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was named Operation Red Dawn and its targets were dubbed &quot;Wolverine 1&quot; and &quot;Wolverine 2&quot;. Army Captain Geoffrey McMurray, who named the mission, said the naming &quot;was so fitting because it was a patriotic, pro-American movie.&quot; Milius approved of the naming, saying &quot;I was deeply flattered and honored. It&#x27;s nice to have a lasting legacy.&quot;

== Cultural influence ==
&quot;Red Dawn&quot; has been reference for and influence on a number of other media, including music, books, film, and video games.
Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, &#x27;Wolverines&#x27; graffiti was reported seen on a destroyed Russian APC.

=== Books, film and television ===
* Numerous references occur in the movie &quot;Hot Tub Time Machine&quot;, including the movie playing in the Ski Patrol station and being watched by Blaine, who considers it one of the best movies of all time.
* &quot;Grey Dawn&quot; is a &quot;South Park&quot; episode which parodies &quot;Red Dawn&quot; where the old people of the town, fed up with how they are treated, take over the quiet Colorado town.
* The 2017 American military drama series &quot;SEAL Team&quot; episode &quot;Rolling Dark&quot; contains numerous references to &quot;Red Dawn&quot;, such as the one scene where a SEAL operator shouts the Wolverines motto to the Russian pursuers.
Phineas and Ferb into the 2nd Dimension references Red Dawn when Irving stands above destroyed robots, holds a staff up, and yells, &quot;Wolverines!&quot;

=== Music ===
* Rock musician David Rosenthal formed the prog rock group Red Dawn in 1992 with drummer Chuck Burgi and bassist Greg Smith.

=== Video games ===
&quot;Red Dawn&quot; has influenced a number of video games.
* &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot; is a 2003 video game that takes place during a Soviet invasion of New York. This game is heavily influenced by &quot;Red Dawn&quot;&#x27;s characters, costumes, and design. The game&#x27;s last mission closely resembles one of the movie&#x27;s final scenes, when the Wolverines attack the Soviet base.
* The plot of &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot; includes an invasion of the United States by an ultra-nationalist Russia, where members of the United States Army&#x27;s 75th Ranger Regiment have to repel the attack. The achievement &quot;Red Dawn&quot; is awarded for completing the American &quot;Wolverines!&quot; and &quot;Exodus&quot; missions in Veteran difficulty. &quot;Wolverines!&quot; itself is a reference to the movie.
* &quot;Homefront,&quot; a video game also written by John Milius about a unified Korea invading North America, borrows heavily from the movie. One notable Easter egg relating to the film is a large billboard at a school sport stadium which reads &quot;Go Wolverines!!!&quot;. In turn, the plot of the 2012 remake of &quot;Red Dawn&quot; borrows heavily from &quot;Homefront&quot;, including the use of a united Korean threat, the use of rural and suburban settings for the primary action, and partisan warfare.

=== Red Dawn emails ===
In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a string of emails by Trump administration officials detailing concerns about the government&#x27;s response to COVID-19 was dubbed the &quot;Red Dawn emails&quot; in reference to the film.

=== Ukrainian resistance during the Russo-Ukrainian War===

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, several Russian armored vehicles destroyed by the Ukrainians appeared with the word &quot;Wolverines&quot; spray-painted in white, a clear reference to the film. One theory is that numerically the Ukrainian are outnumbered by the Russians, similar to the scenario depicted in the film. It is not known whether &quot;Wolverines&quot; was painted by civilians or soldiers, but it has been spotted in Kyiv.

== Remake ==

A remake of &quot;Red Dawn&quot; directed by Dan Bradley was released in 2012. The film takes place in the 2010s, with North Korea invading the United States. Milius criticized the remake as &quot;terrible&quot; after reading an original script where the villains were Chinese:
&quot;There was a strange feeling to the whole thing. They were fans of the movie so they put in stuff they thought was neat. It&#x27;s all about neat action scenes, and has nothing to do with story. ... There&#x27;s only one example in 4,000 years of Chinese territorial adventurism, and that was in 1979, when they invaded Vietnam, and to put it mildly they got their [butts] handed to them ... Why would China want us? They sell us stuff. We&#x27;re a market. I would have done it about Mexico.&quot;

<text>Gran Canaria (, ; ), also Grand Canary Island, is the third-largest and second-most-populous island of the Canary Islands, an archipelago off the Atlantic coast of Northwest Africa and is part of Spain. the island had a population of that constitutes approximately 40% of the population of the archipelago.
Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, the capital of the island, is the largest city of the Canary Islands and the ninth-largest of Spain.

Gran Canaria is located in the Atlantic Ocean in a region known as Macaronesia about off the northwestern coast of Africa and about from Europe. With an area of and an altitude of at Morro de la Agujereada, Gran Canaria is the third largest island of the archipelago in both area and altitude. Gran Canaria is also the third most populated island in Spain.

==History==
In antiquity, Gran Canaria was populated by the North African Canarii, who may have arrived as early as 500 BC. 

In the medieval period, after over a century of European incursions and attempts at conquest, the island was conquered on 29 April 1483, by the Crown of Castile, under Queen Isabella I. The Canarian queen Abenchara was captured and imprisoned by the Spanish during the conquest. The conquest succeeded after a war that lasted five years, and it was an important step towards the expansion of the unified Spain.

The capital city of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria was founded on 24 June 1478, under the name &quot;Real de Las Palmas&quot;, by Juan Rejón, head of the invading Castilian army. In 1492, Christopher Columbus anchored in the Port of Las Palmas (and spent some time on the island) on his first trip to the Americas. Las Palmas de Gran Canaria is, jointly with Santa Cruz de Tenerife, the capital of the autonomous community of the Canary Islands. Much of Iberian migration to the island consisted of conversos of Jewish origin.

On 27 March 1977, a bomb went off in Gran Canaria Airport, the main airport on the island. Flights were diverted to the nearby Tenerife Airport: this led to the Tenerife airport disaster.

== Etymology ==
Pliny claimed that the island was named for the dogs on the island, of which two were presented as a gift to Juba, King of Mauretania. This opinion is disputed as when the Europeans arrived on the island, no dogs were found. Another source suggested the way the natives ate fish was doglike and this was the reason for its name. A more plausible assumption is that the island&#x27;s name derives from the people Canario or Canarii living near the Atlas mountain range. Jean de Béthencourt named the island Gran Canaria as the people on the island were valorous opponents to his conquest.

== Geography ==

Gran Canaria is located in the Canary Islands archipelago southeast of Tenerife and west of Fuerteventura. The island is of volcanic origin, mostly made of fissure vents. It has a round shape, with a diameter of approximately and a surface area of . Gran Canaria&#x27;s maximum elevation is at Morro de la Agujereada, although the nearby Pico de las Nieves has traditionally been considered the island&#x27;s tallest peak. The coastline measures 236 km.

=== Geology ===
About 80% of the volume of the island was formed during the Miocene period eruptions, between 14 and 9 million years ago. This is called the &quot;Old Cycle&quot; and is estimated to have lasted some 200,000 years and have emitted about , mostly of fissural alkali basalt. This cycle continued with the emission of trachytes, phonolites and peralkaline rocks. This period was followed by one of erosion, which lasted some 4 million years.

A second cycle of volcanic eruptions, known as the &quot;Roque Nublo cycle&quot;, took place between 4.5 and 3.4 million years ago. This shorter cycle emitted about . Most of the inland peaks were formed by erosion from these materials. This period also started with fissural basalts, but ended with violent eruptions of pyroclastic flows. Some phonolitic features, like the Risco Blanco, were also formed in its last stages.

The third or recent cycle is held to have started some 2.8 million years ago and is considered to be still active. The last eruptions are held to have occurred some 2000 years ago.

The changes in volume and, therefore, weight of the island have also caused the island to rise above the previous sea level during erosive periods and to sink during eruptive periods. Some of these &quot;fossil beaches&quot; can be seen in the cliff faces of the more eroded northern coast.

=== Climate ===
According to the Köppen climate classification, Gran Canaria is considered to have a hot desert climate (BWh) due to its severe lack of precipitation. Gran Canaria has consistent warm temperatures in spring, summer and autumn, and mild winters. Gran Canaria is noted for its rich variety of microclimates. Generally speaking though, the average daytime high ranges from in winter to in summer. Some cool nights occur in winter, but lows below are unknown near the coast. Inland the climate is still mild but mountainous areas see the occasional frost or snow. Annual rainfall averages , most of this falling in the cooler months, with July, August and September normally rainless. Rainfall is unevenly distributed through the island with some areas being much drier than others.
Cloud cover and sunshine is often quite variable during the cooler months, and there can be several rather cloudy days at times in winter. Summers are generally quite sunny however, with the south of the island being most favoured.

== Vegetation ==

Until the conquest, Gran Canaria had extensive forests, but then suffered extensive deforestation as a result of continuous logging, land divisions and other intensive uses. This reduced the forest cover to just , making the island the most deforested of the Canary Islands. However, in the twentieth century reforestation of the ridge of the island was begun, recovering some of the lost forest mass. Much of the summit of the island is forested mostly due to reforestation.

==Governance==

Gran Canaria is in the autonomous community of the Canary Islands (&quot;Islas Canarias&quot;). It lies within the Province of Las Palmas, a Spanish province which consists of the eastern part of the Canary Islands community. Las Palmas de Gran Canaria is the provincial capital, one of the two capitals of the Canary Islands along with Santa Cruz de Tenerife.

The island of Gran Canaria is governed by the Cabildo insular de Gran Canaria. Gran Canaria Island itself is divided into twenty-one smaller municipalities:

The island has a population at the start of 2023 of 862,893 - with 380,863 of those in the capital city of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. Gran Canaria is the second most populous island of the Canary Islands, after Tenerife.

== Transportation ==
===Roads===


Gran Canaria has roads encircling the whole island and extending into the mountain areas. In the late 20th century, its dual carriageway, among the first in the Canary Islands, were opened and run around Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, and were later extended to the north coast and the airport and subsequently to the south coast in response to increased tourist traffic. The only highway of Gran Canaria are GC1. Dual carriageway is GC2, and GC31, GC4 and GC5. The western and the north-western parts, with the fewest inhabitants, are linked only with main roads.

===Buses===
Public transport around Gran Canaria is provided by an extensive bus network, known in the local dialect as &quot;&quot;. The &quot;Autoridad Única del Transporte de Gran Canaria&quot; (Gran Canaria Transport Authority, TGC) manages the network and operates a number of bus stations across the island, including San Telmo and Santa Catalina bus stations in Las Palmas, Maspalomas and Galdar. Bus tickets may be purchased with cash, and AUTGC also operates a contactless electronic ticket called the TransGC Card, which is valid across the whole network.

Inter-urban bus services across the island are operated by the Global bus company. Global was created in 2000 after the merger of two bus companies, Utinsa (which operated in the north of the island) and Salcai (the bus operator for the south). Local bus services in Las Palmas are run by the municipal bus company, &quot;Guaguas Municipales de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria&quot;.

===Airport===
Gran Canaria Airport (IATA: LPA) is the only commercial airport on the island. The large number of aircraft and passengers passing through it each year make it one of the busiest in Spain. Gran Canaria is also responsible for all air traffic control in the Canaries. By destination island, Gran Canaria is the second island that congregates the largest number of passengers in the Canary Islands. Car rental companies that have offices in the airports are: Autoreisen, Avis, Cicar, Europcar, Goldcar (only south airport), Hertz, Sixt and TopCar.

===Sea ports===
The most important ports in the island are the Port of Las Palmas &quot;(Puerto de la Luz),&quot; in the city of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; Arguineguín, which exports cement from a large factory; and Arinaga, located in the main industrial zone of Canaries and one of the major ones of Spain.

The main passenger ports are the Port of La Luz, where Trasmediterránea operates a weekly ferry route to Cádiz on the Spanish mainland, and the Port of Las Nieves, located in Agaete on the west side of the island, where Fred Olsen Express operates a catamaran ferry service to Santa Cruz de Tenerife.

===Rail===
Plans for a Tren de Gran Canaria railway network linking the capital with the south have been approved by both the Gran Canaria Cabildo and the autonomous Canary Islands&#x27; Government, though the discussion with the central Spanish Government hinges now on budget. The planned railway line would run between Las Palmas and Meloneras, with the section in the capital running entirely underground as far as the suburb of Jinámar. The line is planned to have 11 stations, including an underground station at Gran Canaria Airport. The scheme was first announced in 2009, with a planned operational date in 2015. A public company called &quot;Ferrocarriles de Gran Canaria&quot; has been formed by the Cabildo&#x27;s Gran Canaria Transport Authority. Plans were still being discussed in 2018.

== Agriculture ==
Gran Canaria agriculture is unique among the Canaries islands in that it was traditionally dominated by plantations, with much of these being grains as well as sugarcane, rather than by stock-breeding. The caves of Valerón (a property of cultural interest in the &quot;archaeological site&quot; category) in the municipality of Santa María de Guía bears testimony of it by being the largest pre-Hispanic collective granary of the Canaries.

== Tourism ==

This island is called a &quot;miniature continent&quot; due to the different climates and variety of landscapes found, with long beaches and dunes of white sand, contrasting with green ravines and picturesque villages. A third of the island is under protection as a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO.

The number of annual visitors was 3.6 million in 2014 (of which 450.000 Spaniards). It is the second island in the archipelago in number of annual tourists, after Tenerife. Most of the tourists visit the southern part of the island. The north tends to be cooler, while the south is warmer and sunny. The east coast of the island is flat, dotted with beaches, while the western coast is rockier and mountainous.

The island possesses 32 Natural Protected Spaces, notably the Rural Park of Nublo, The Doramas Jungle, the Azuaje Ravine, Tamadaba, Pino Santo, etc.

In the south there is a large bird park, Palmitos Park, as well as many beach resort communities. Resorts are concentrated in the central eastern part of the southern coast in the Maspalomas area, which includes the towns of San Agustín, Playa del Inglés and Meloneras. The Maspalomas Dunes are located between Playa del Inglés (&quot;The Englishman&#x27;s Beach&quot;) and the distinctive 19th century Maspalomas lighthouse. Playa del Ingles is home to the Yumbo Centre, which was opened in 1982 and has almost 200 shops, including bars, restaurants, cafes, fashion boutiques, electronic outlets and jewellery stores.

In Tarajalillo, an Aeroclub exists from where tourist flights can be taken over the island.

Still further to the west along the southern shore, in the Municipality of Mogán, are the communities of Puerto Rico and Puerto de Mogán, a village referred to as &quot;Little Venice&quot; on account of its many canals.

Other attractions include Cocodrilos Park, Roque Nublo (an 80 m monolith), Cenobio de Valerón with more than 350 storage cavities, Painted cave of Galdar the most important archaeological park in Canary Islands, or the botanical gardens &quot;Jardín Canario&quot; (in Tafira Alta) and &quot;Cactualdea&quot; (in La Aldea de San Nicolás).

El Dedo de Dios, or &quot;God&#x27;s Finger&quot;, was a rocky spire jutting from the sea in Puerto de las Nieves, and was previously the signature attraction of the Canary Islands until it was destroyed by tropical storm Delta that crossed the archipelago in November 2005.

Other well-known rock formations are El Cura (also known as El Fraile), The Frog (La Rana), Roque Bentayga, the Roque de Gando, and the Peñón Bermejo. Traditionally, the highest peak of the island has been considered to be the Pico de las Nieves, at ; however, Morro de la Agujereada is taller, at .

The capital city is Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. &quot;Las Canteras&quot; beach, a protected area and diving zone, lies in the heart of the city. Las Palmas de Gran Canaria is also known for its annual &quot;carnaval&quot;. It was the first stop of Christopher Columbus&#x27; expedition on his way back from the Americas, a commemoration of which is the Hermitage of San Antonio Abad, where the navigator prayed, and the &quot;Casa de Colón&quot;. Other attractions in the capital city include the &quot;Museo Canario&quot; (the most important archaeology museum in the archipelago), the cathedral and the &quot;Plaza del Espíritu Santo&quot;. In Teror the shrine of &quot;Virgen del Pino&quot; (&quot;Virgin of the Pine&quot;), patron saint of Gran Canaria, can be found. Its feast is celebrated on 8 September.

The town of Agüimes, on the eastern part of the island, has been carefully restored and its town centre, centered on its old church and a peaceful square, now evokes the quiet living of a traditional Canarian town. The district also has some of the best preserved cave dwellings, in the protected area of the Guayadeque ravine, where even the church has been built into the mountainside and visitors can find a number of popular cave restaurants. The district also includes the most renowned scuba diving area on the island: the marine reserve at the &quot;playa de El Cabrón&quot; just outside the town of Arinaga.

Other important towns are Telde, known among other things for their surf schools in Salinetas, Vecindario (within the municipality of Santa Lucía de Tirajana) and Gáldar, that contains an important diving zone. In Arucas there is a Neogothic temple, popularly known as &quot;Arucas&#x27; Cathedral&quot;, as well as a large fertile plain where bananas are grown. In Gáldar and its surroundings there is also a banana-growing plain and some remarkable archaeological remains, such as the Painted cave of Galdar or the cenobio de Valerón&#x27;s communal silos, ancient tombs (among which the necropolis of Maipés), and the port of Sardina del Norte (one of the island&#x27;s ports where, as in Las Palmas&#x27;, Christopher Columbus used to get supplies for his ships).

Heading west along the southern coast is the fishing city of Arguineguín in the Municipality of Mogán.

<doc id="265148" wikidata="Q3477306" url="?curid=265148" title="Secretary of State for Education">
<text>The secretary of state for education, also referred to as the education secretary, is a secretary of state in the Government of the United Kingdom, responsible for the work of the Department for Education. The incumbent is a member of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom. As education is fully devolved to the Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland Executive, the post holder has no jurisdiction or influence in education policy or direction in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Therefore, the Cabinet Secretary for Education legislates on education matters only in England. 

The office holder works alongside the other Education ministers. The corresponding shadow minister is the shadow secretary of state for education, and the work of the secretary of state is also scrutinised by the Education Select Committee.

The current education secretary is Bridget Phillipson.

==Responsibilities==
Corresponding to what is generally known as an education minister in many other countries, the education secretary&#x27;s remit is concerned primarily with England. This includes:
* Early years
* Children&#x27;s social care
* Teacher recruitment and retention
* The national curriculum
* School improvement
* Academies and free schools
* Further education
* Apprenticeships and skills
* Higher education
* Oversight of the departmental coronavirus (COVID-19) response
* Oversight of school infrastructure improvement

==History==
A committee of the Privy Council was appointed in 1839 to supervise the distribution of certain government grants in the education field. The members of the committee were the Lord President of the Council, the Secretaries of State, the First Lord of the Treasury, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. From 1857 a vice-president was appointed who took responsibility for policy.

On 1 April 1900, the Board of Education Act 1899 abolished the committee and instituted a new board, headed by a president. The members were initially very similar to the old committee and the president of the board was the Lord President of the council; however, from 1902 this ceased to be the case and the president of the board was appointed separately (although the Marquess of Londonderry happened to hold both jobs from 1903 to 1905).

The Education Act 1944 replaced the Board of Education with a new Ministry of Education.

The position of Secretary of State for Education and Science was created in 1964 with the merger of the offices of Minister of Education and the Minister of Science. The postholder oversaw the Department of Education and Science.

From June 1970 to March 1974, this post was held by future prime minister Margaret Thatcher.

In 1992, the responsibility for science was transferred to Cabinet Office&#x27;s Office of Public Service, and the department was renamed Department of Education. In 1995 the department merged with the Department of Employment to become the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) and in 2001 the employment functions were transferred to a newly created Department for Work and Pensions, with the DfEE becoming the Department for Education and Skills (DfES). In 2007 under Gordon Brown&#x27;s new premiership, the DfES was split into two new departments; the Department for Children, Schools and Families, and a Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, under two new secretaries of state.

The ministerial office of the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills was, in late 2009, amalgamated into the new ministerial office of the resurgent politician Peter Mandelson, made a peer and given the title Lord Mandelson as the newly created Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills – itself an amalgamation of the responsibilities of the Secretaries of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and Innovation, Universities and Skills. The Secretary of State has remit over higher education policy as well as British business and enterprise.

From 14 July 2016 to 8 January 2018 the post was held by Justine Greening, as her predecessor, Nicky Morgan, was sacked by Theresa May. Greening resigned after rejecting a reshuffle to the Department for Work and Pensions. 

On 7 July 2022, Michelle Donelan became the shortest-serving cabinet member in British history, when she resigned as Education Secretary 35 hours after being appointed.

<text>Danger Man (retitled Secret Agent in the United States for the revived series, and Destination Danger and John Drake in other overseas markets) is a British television series that was broadcast between 1960 and 1962, and again between 1964 and 1968. The series featured Patrick McGoohan as secret agent John Drake. Ralph Smart created the programme and wrote many of the scripts. &quot;Danger Man&quot; was financed by Lew Grade&#x27;s ITC Entertainment.

==Series development==
The idea for &quot;Danger Man&quot; originated with Ralph Smart, an associate of Lew Grade, head of ITC Entertainment. Grade was looking for formats that could be exported.

Ian Fleming was brought in to collaborate on series development, but left before development was complete. Like James Bond, the main character is a globetrotting spy who works at first for NATO, in series one, and then for the fictional British intelligence service M9 for the remainder of the show&#x27;s run. Like Bond, Drake cleverly extricates himself from life-threatening situations, albeit with gadgetry which is less 
fantastic than Bond&#x27;s, and introduces himself as &quot;Drake...John Drake.&quot;

After McGoohan was cast, he also affected character development. A key difference from Bond traces to the family-oriented star&#x27;s preferences: no firearms (with a few rare exceptions, such as episode 26, &quot;The Journey Ends Halfway&quot;) and no outright seduction of female co-stars (although Drake did engage in low-key romance in a few episodes).

==Premise==
From the series one voice-over:
The line &quot;NATO also has its own&quot; is not always present.

The mention of the Deuxième Bureau as France&#x27;s secret service branch in the 1960s was, however, incorrect. This organization was no longer in existence, having been replaced by the SDECE at the end of WW II.

==Programme overview==
The first series of 39 episodes ran 24–25 minutes each and portrayed John Drake as working for a Washington, D.C.–based intelligence organisation, on behalf of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), whose assignments frequently took him to Africa, Latin America, and the Far East. They were filmed in black and white.

For the second and third series which aired several years after the first, the episode&#x27;s length was extended to 48–49 minutes and Drake underwent retconning. His nationality became British, and he was an agent working for a secret British government department, called M9 (analogous to Secret Intelligence Service), though his Mid-Atlantic accent persists for the first few episodes in production. These were also filmed in black and white.

Other than the largely nominal change of employer and nationality, Drake&#x27;s mandate remains the same: &quot;to undertake missions involving national and global security&quot;. In keeping with the episodic format of such series in the 1960s, there are no ongoing story arcs and there is no reference made to Drake&#x27;s NATO adventures in the later M9 episodes.

===Pilot episode===
The pilot was written by Brian Clemens, who later co-produced &quot;The Avengers&quot;. In an interview Clemens said:

The pilot I wrote was called &quot;View from the Villa&quot; and it was set in Italy, but the production manager set the shoot on location in Portmeirion, which looked like Italy but which was much closer. And obviously the location stuck in Patrick McGoohan&#x27;s mind, because that&#x27;s where he shot his television series &quot;The Prisoner&quot; much later.

The second unit director on the pilot, according to Clemens:

... shot some location and background stuff and sent the dailies back to the editing room at Elstree. Ralph Smart looked at them, hated them, and called up the second unit director and said &quot;Look, these are terrible, you&#x27;ll never be a film director,&quot; and then he fired him. The name of the second unit director? John Schlesinger.
===Cancellation and resurrection===
When American financing for a second series failed to materialise, the programme was cancelled. The first series had aired in America each Wednesday, 8:30 to 9:00 pm (Eastern Standard Time), on CBS from 5 April to 13 September 1961. It was used by the network as a late-spring replacement for &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot;, which had just wrapped its third and final series.

After a two-year hiatus, two things had changed; &quot;Danger Man&quot; had subsequently been resold all around the world, with repeat showings creating a public clamour for new ones. Also by this time, James Bond had become popular, as had ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Avengers&quot;. &quot;Danger Man&quot;″s creator, Ralph Smart, rethought the concept; the second series&#x27; (1964) episodes were 49 minutes long and had a new musical theme, Edwin Astley&#x27;s &quot;High Wire&quot;. Drake gained an English accent and did not clash with his bosses at first. The revived &quot;Danger Man&quot; was broadcast in the U.S. as &quot;Secret Agent&quot;, first shown as a CBS summer-replacement program. It had a new U.S.-only theme song, &quot;Secret Agent Man&quot;, sung by Johnny Rivers, which became a success in its own right. In other parts of the world, the show was titled &quot;Destination Danger&quot; or &quot;John Drake&quot;.

The fourth series consists of only two episodes, &quot;Koroshi&quot; and &quot;Shinda Shima&quot;, the only two episodes of &quot;Danger Man&quot; to be filmed in colour. These two separate but related episodes were recut together as a feature for cinemas in Europe and for American broadcast, as done with two-parters from other ITC series such as &quot;The Baron&quot; and &quot;The Saint.&quot; Whilst &quot;Koroshi&quot; retains a strong plot-line and sharp characterisations, &quot;Shinda Shima&quot; drew heavily on contemporary Bond movies, principally &quot;Dr. No&quot;. When the episodes were completed, McGoohan announced he was resigning from the series to create, produce, and star in a project titled &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, with David Tomblin as co-producer and George Markstein as script editor. Markstein was then the &quot;Danger Man&quot; script consultant. A number of behind-the-scenes personnel on &quot;Danger Man&quot; were subsequently hired for &quot;The Prisoner&quot;.

The two colour episodes aired (in black and white) in the UK in the time slot of &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, which could not make its scheduled broadcast dates. The European cinema film feature version, &quot;Koroshi&quot;, did not receive theatrical release in the US, but instead aired on network television as a TV movie in 1968.

===Character of &#x27;Drake&#x27;===
Unlike the James Bond films, &quot;Danger Man&quot; strove for realism, dramatising credible Cold War tensions. In the second series, Drake is an undercover agent of a British intelligence agency. As in the earlier series, Drake finds himself in danger with not always happy outcomes; sometimes duty forces him to decisions that lead to good people suffering unfair consequences. Drake doesn&#x27;t always do what his superiors tell him.

Drake is rarely armed, though he engaged in fist fights, and the gadgets he uses are generally credible. In one episode (&quot;To Our Best Friend&quot;), Drake says, &quot;I never carry a gun. They&#x27;re noisy, and they hurt people. Besides, I manage very well without.&quot; Although the villains are often killed, Drake himself rarely does the killing. An examination of all episodes indicates that, in the entire series, he only shoots one person dead, in one of the last half-hour episodes from the 1960 season. While another shooting occurs in &quot;The Ubiquitous Mr. Lovegrove&quot;, it is revealed to be a dream. Drake is almost never shown armed with a gun, and the episode &quot;Time to Kill&quot; centres on Drake&#x27;s hesitancy and initial refusal to take an assassination mission (events occur to prevent Drake from having to carry out the task). Drake&#x27;s uses of non-firearm deadly force during the series number fewer than a dozen. 

Despite the lack of firearm violence, &quot;The Encyclopedia of 20th-Century American Television&quot; by Ron Lackmann inexplicably describes &quot;Danger Man&quot; as one of the most violent series ever produced.

Drake uses his intelligence, charm and quick thinking rather than force. He usually plays a role to infiltrate a situation, for example, scout for a travel agency, naive soldier, embittered ex-convict, brainless playboy, imperious physician, opportunistic journalist, bumbling tourist, cold-blooded mercenary, bland diplomat, smarmy pop disc-jockey, precise clerk, compulsive gambler or impeccable butler.

Drake is often shown re-using gadgets from previous episodes. Among the more frequently seen are a small spy camera hidden in a cigarette lighter and activated by flicking the lighter, a miniature reel-to-reel tape recorder hidden inside the head of an electric shaver or a pack of cigarettes, and a microphone, which could be embedded in a wall near the target via a shotgun-like apparatus, that used soda siphon cartridges containing CO2 as the propellant, allowing Drake to eavesdrop on conversations from a safe distance.

As Drake gets involved in a case, things are rarely as they seem. He is not infallible—he gets arrested, he makes mistakes, equipment fails, careful plans do not work; Drake often has to improvise an alternative plan. Sometimes investigation fails and he simply does something provocative to crack open the case. People he trusts can turn out to be untrustworthy or incompetent; he finds unexpected allies.

John Drake, unlike Bond, never romanced any of the series&#x27; female characters, as McGoohan was determined to create a family-friendly show. McGoohan denounced the sexual promiscuity of James Bond and &quot;The Saint&quot;, roles he had rejected, although he had played romantic roles before &quot;Danger Man&quot;. Drake uses his immense charm in his undercover work, and women are often very attracted to him, but the viewers are left to assume whatever they want about Drake&#x27;s personal life. The only exceptions to this rule were the two &quot;linked&quot; episodes of the series, &quot;You&#x27;re Not in Any Trouble, Are You?&quot; and &quot;Are You Going to be More Permanent?&quot;, in which Drake encounters two different women—both played by Susan Hampshire—and which contain numerous similarities in dialogue and set-pieces and both end with Drake in a pseudo-romantic circumstance with Hampshire&#x27;s character. Drake is also shown falling for the female lead in the episode &quot;The Black Book&quot; though nothing comes of it; this episode is also one of the only scripts to directly address Drake&#x27;s loneliness in his chosen profession. Many times the women in the show turned out to be femmes fatales, and heavily involved in the very plots Drake is fighting.

===Co-stars and guest stars===
In the second series, Drake displays an increasingly resentful attitude towards his superiors at M9, first answering unwillingly to &quot;Gorton&quot; (Raymond Adamson) and later to &quot;The Admiral&quot; or Hobbs (Peter Madden). In the series, &quot;Hardy&quot; was played by Richard Wattis.

Guest stars included Donald Pleasence (who was Blofeld in a James Bond movie), Howard Marion Crawford, Charles Gray, (who also appeared in two James Bond movies), Donald Houston, Maurice Denham, Joan Greenwood, John Le Mesurier, Sylvia Syms, Paul Eddington, William Marshall, Patsy Ann Noble, Lois Maxwell (she, too, featured in a James Bond movie as Miss Moneypenny), Burt Kwouk, and Peter Sallis.

==Episode list==
==Music==

===Theme===

* Series 1 &quot;The Danger Man Theme&quot;, composed by Edwin Astley
* Series 2–4 &quot;High Wire&quot;, composed by Edwin Astley
* Series 2–4 in the US as Secret Agent, &quot;Secret Agent Man&quot;, theme composed by P. F. Sloan and Steve Barri, and recorded by Johnny Rivers.
* Incidental music throughout all four series by Edwin Astley
* Series 3 episode 23 &quot;Not So Jolly Roger&quot; concerned a pirate radio station that was run by spies passing on secrets. Prominently featured was &quot;He Who Rides A Tiger&quot; (Trevor Peacock / Gordon Waine), performed by Patsy Ann Noble; Noble herself appeared in the episode as a disc jockey on the pirate radio station which was broadcasting from an abandoned Maunsell Fort. The episode was filmed when pirate station Radio 390 was occupying the fort. &quot;Not So Jolly Roger&quot; also featured songs composed and performed by Rick Minus.

The second &quot;Danger Man&quot; theme, &quot;High Wire,&quot; developed during series 2–4. The original version features a subdued rhythm section with almost inaudible drums. This was replaced with a revised version with drums and bass pushed to the fore in the mix. The end credits theme tune was set to end in the same manner as the opening theme, ending on the held, questioning, lower &quot;E&quot;. The two-note coda was added soon afterwards to make a definite ending. An audio clip from the recording session can be heard as an extra on the final disc of the DVD set from Network DVD. The revised theme featured this as a normal end to the tune. As series 4 was to be made in colour, a completely new arrangement was recorded which owed much to the arrangement on Astley&#x27;s full-length version of &quot;High Wire&quot; (released on single the previous year – see below). The feature film &quot;Koroshi&quot; was created from the only two episodes made for series 4, &quot;Koroshi&quot; and &quot;Shinda Shima&quot;, and uses this new arrangement over the closing titles only.

When the show was picked up in America, Johnny Rivers recalled,

===Programme ID===

The original opening ID changed as the series progressed. The first series had McGoohan leaving a building and getting into a convertible under the opening narration reproduced earlier, and driving off.

The earlier of the two sequences for the hour-long series features a photograph of a benevolently smiling McGoohan that zooms partly out towards the right of the frame, then stops, adding the legend &quot;Patrick McGoohan as&quot;. The three-ringed &#x27;target&#x27; revolves round in time to the three-note orchestra hits to obscure McGoohan&#x27;s photo as it reveals the programme logo on a pure black background.

The second version was in two segments. The first segment is filmed, comprising a full-length McGoohan in stark negative, menacingly taking a few paces towards the camera, before he then stops. In quick succession, the camera zooms in fast onto his eyes, freeze-frames, then switches from negative to positive. The legend &quot;Patrick McGoohan as&quot; is added. This then switches to a different photo with McGoohan looking left out of picture. The familiar three-ringed &#x27;target&#x27; then reveals the programme logo on a pure black background as before. The music was re-recorded for this version of the ident and lasted for the rest of the programme&#x27;s run.

==Transition to &quot;The Prisoner&quot;==
McGoohan resigned from the series, forcing its cancellation. He had been working on a new project entitled &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, with David Tomblin as co-producer and George Markstein as script editor. Markstein was then the &quot;Danger Man&quot; script consultant. A number of behind-the-scenes personnel on &quot;Danger Man&quot; were subsequently hired for &quot;The Prisoner&quot;. An unused, fourth-series script was reworked as an episode of &quot;The Champions&quot;.

Inspiration for &quot;The Prisoner&quot; came from a &quot;Danger Man&quot; episode called &quot;Colony Three&quot;[says who?], in which Drake infiltrates a spy school in Eastern Europe during the Cold War. The school, in the middle of nowhere, is set up to look like a normal English town in which pupils and instructors mix as in any other normal city, but the instructors are virtual prisoners with little hope of ever leaving. It is often thought this episode was a precursor to &quot;The Prisoner&quot;; it was filmed in the new town of Hatfield, Hertfordshire. The actor Derren Nesbitt (as a Number Two in &quot;The Prisoner&quot;) who appears in the episode &quot;Time to Kill&quot;, Peter Swanwick (as supervisor in &quot;The Prisoner&quot;) in the episodes &quot;The Key&quot; and &quot;The Paper Chase&quot;; and the actor Richard Wattis who played Drake&#x27;s superior Mr.Hardy (Mr. Fotheringay in &quot;The Prisoner&quot;) are later members of the cast in &quot;The Prisoner&quot; and many others.

&quot;Prisoner&quot; fans frequently debate whether John Drake of &quot;Danger Man&quot; and Number Six in &quot;The Prisoner&quot; are the same person. Like John Drake, Number Six is evidently a secret agent, but one who has resigned from his job.

According to &quot;The Prisoner: The Official Companion&quot; by Robert Fairclough, the &quot;Prisoner&quot; episode &quot;The Girl Who Was Death&quot; was based upon a two-part &quot;Danger Man&quot; script that had been planned for the fourth series. In this surreal episode, Number Six meets &quot;Potter&quot;, John Drake&#x27;s &quot;Danger Man&quot; contact. Christopher Benjamin portrayed the character in both series, with the episode also featuring an actor named John Drake in a small, non-speaking role. As well as guest-starring in this show, Paul Eddington played another spy and No.6&#x27;s former colleague, Cobb, in the opening episode of the &quot;Prisoner.&quot; 

The first &quot;Danger Man&quot; season includes four episodes which use footage filmed in the Welsh resort of Portmeirion, which later became the primary shooting location of the Village in &quot;The Prisoner&quot;.

Reference books disagree on whether &quot;The Prisoner&quot; was a &quot;Danger Man&quot; continuation. Vincent Terrace&#x27;s &quot;The Complete Encyclopedia of Television Programs 1947–1979&quot; postulates that John Drake&#x27;s resignation reason is revealed in the &quot;Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling&quot; episode, which is a follow-up to a mission assigned to Number Six before he was sent to The Village. Richard Meyers makes the same claim in his 1981 book, &quot;TV Detectives&quot;. He further states that this connects directly to &quot;an episode of &quot;Secret Agent&quot; never shown in [the United States] with John Drake investigating the story of a brain transferral device in Europe&quot;, but no such episode of &quot;Danger Man&quot; was ever made. And, indeed, he might have been confusing that plot device with the one from the &quot;Who&#x27;s Who?&quot; episode of the contemporaneous spy-fi show &quot;The Avengers&quot;. Nigel Stock (who played &quot;The Colonel&quot; in &quot;Do Not Forsake Me...&quot;) also guest-starred in the &quot;Danger Man&quot; episode &quot;A Little Loyalty Always Pays&quot;, as Major Bert Barrington.

McGoohan stated in a 1985 interview that the two characters were not the same, and that he had originally wanted a different actor to play the role of Number Six.

==In popular culture==
*The band Tears for Fears refer to the character in their song &quot;Swords and Knives&quot;, and Dead Can Dance titled one of the songs on their &quot;Into the Labyrinth&quot; album &quot;The Ubiquitous Mr. Lovegrove&quot; after a &quot;Danger Man&quot; episode, although the content of the song has no apparent relationship to the episode. Australian band v.Spy v.Spy recorded a version of the &quot;Danger Man&quot; theme on their 1986 debut album &quot;Harrys Reasons?&quot;
*The British animated series &quot;Danger Mouse&quot; was largely inspired by &quot;Danger Man&quot; and is a broad parody of both this series and secret agent films and television in general.
*In episode &quot;No Marks for Servility&quot; (season 2, episode 9, #48, broadcast 8 December 1964), Drake, who is posing as a proper English butler, rescues a kidnapping victim while wearing a bowler hat and trench coat, and carrying a rolled-up umbrella, much as John Steed did on &quot;The Avengers&quot;. Brian Clemens, who co-created &quot;The Avengers&quot;, was also involved with &quot;Danger Man&quot;.

==Home releases==
All four series are now available on DVD in Europe, Australasia and North America.

In Britain, Network DVD released a 13-disc &quot;Special Edition&quot; boxed set of the one-hour shows in June 2007. Extra features include the edited-together movie version of &quot;Koroshi&quot; and &quot;Shinda Shima&quot;, the US &quot;Secret Agent&quot; opening and closing titles, image galleries for each episode, and a specially written 170-page book on the making of the one-hour series. Umbrella Entertainment has released the 24-minute series on DVD in Australia; the 49-minute series has been released by Madman.

Network Distributing Ltd Home Entertainment released the 1st (24 min) series in January 2010 on a 6-disc set with a commemorative booklet by Andrew Pixley. The Carlton 6 disc set is out of issue.

In North America, the three series of hour-long episodes of the series were released by A&amp;E Home Video, under licence from Carlton International Media Limited, under the title &quot;Secret Agent AKA Danger Man&quot; in order to acknowledge the American broadcast and syndication title. The episodes were digitally remastered from 35MM film prints and were presented in their original UK broadcast format and original CBS broadcast order; the two episodes that constituted the aborted fourth season were also included, the first time they had been released in their original format (however, this meant the transition scene filmed for the &quot;Koroshi&quot; feature-length version is omitted). The episodes retain their original &quot;Danger Man&quot; opening credits (including the original theme by the Edwin Astley Orchestra), the first time these have been seen in the U.S., with the &quot;Secret Agent&quot; credits included as an extra feature.

A&amp;E Home Entertainment later released the first season of the original UK &quot;Danger Man&quot; on Region 1 DVD, newly restored and remastered, unedited, uncut and presented in its original UK broadcast format and order.

A&amp;E subsequently released a single-set &quot;megabox&quot; containing all of the one-hour episodes; a revised megabox, released in 2007, added the half-hour episodes, and was released again in a modified slimline package in 2010. To date, no North American DVD release has occurred of the &quot;Koroshi&quot; TV movie edit of the two fourth-season episodes.

On 9 December 2014, Timeless Media Group re-released the entire series on DVD in Region 1 in a 17-disc set entitled &quot;Secret Agent (Danger Man)- The Complete Series&quot;.

As of October 2020, Danger Man is streaming on Amazon and Roku. As of February 2022, it&#x27;s also shown on Tubi.

==Production==
 The Washington title sequence of the first series 24-minute episodes is a composite of the United States Capitol in the background and the Castrol Building, complete with a London Bus stop, in the Marylebone Road, London as the foreground. This building is now Marathon House, converted from offices to flats in 1998.

In reality, no such building is allowed to exist in Washington, D.C., as the Height of Buildings Act of 1910 limits the heights of building (except churches) to , thus giving the United States Capitol building, at , an unobstructed view from any part of the city. (This has led to the popular belief that buildings in Washington, D.C. are restricted to the height of the U.S. Capitol building.)

==Original novels and comic books==

Several original novels based upon &quot;Danger Man&quot; were published in the UK and US, the majority during 1965 and 1966.
* &quot;Target for Tonight&quot; – Richard Telfair, 1962 (published in US only)
* &quot;Departure Deferred&quot; – W. Howard Baker, 1965
* &quot;Storm Over Rockall&quot; – W. Howard Baker, 1965
* &quot;Hell for Tomorrow&quot; – Peter Leslie, 1965
* &quot;The Exterminator&quot; – W.A. Balinger [W. Howard Baker], 1966
* &quot;No Way Out&quot; – Wilfred McNeilly, 1966

Several of the above novels were translated into French and published in France, where the series was known as &quot;Destination Danger&quot;. An additional &quot;Destination Danger&quot; novel by John Long was published in French and not printed in the US or UK. At least one of the novels, &quot;The Exterminator&quot;, was later republished in the 1970s by Zenith Publications in the UK, with no direct reference to &quot;Danger Man&quot; on the cover.

The adventures of John Drake have also been depicted in comic book form. In 1961, Dell Comics in the US (whose book-publishing cousin issued the Telfair novel) published a one-shot &quot;Danger Man&quot; comic as part of its long-running &quot;Four Color&quot; series, based upon the first series format. It depicted Drake as having red hair, a trait shared with Patrick McGoohan, but which was unseen as &quot;Danger Man&quot; had been made only in monochrome at that time. In 1966, Gold Key Comics published two issues of a &quot;Secret Agent&quot; comic book based upon the hour-long series (this series should not be confused with &quot;Secret Agent&quot;, an unrelated comic book series published by Charlton Comics in 1967, formerly titled &quot;Sarge Steel&quot;). In Britain, a single &quot;Danger Man&quot; comic book subtitled &quot;Trouble in Turkey&quot; appeared in the mid-1960s and a number of comic strip adventures appeared in hardback annuals. French publishers also produced several issues of a &quot;Destination Danger&quot; comic book in the 1960s, although their Drake was blond. Spanish publishers produced a series titled &quot;Agent Secreto&quot;. The Germans were particularly prolific, using &#x27;John Drake&#x27; and a picture of McGoohan, as the cover for hundreds of &quot;krimi&quot; magazines.

==Broadcasters==

===Australia===
The Australian rights are held by the Nine Network who, over many decades, have shown numerous repeats in non-peak viewing times. From 2012 to 2017 there were numerous showings in the early hours of the morning on Gem, a Nine Network digital outlet, sometimes twice per morning. The &quot;Danger Man&quot; repeats alternate with re-screenings of other British series such as &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Way&quot;, &quot;The Baron,&quot; and &quot;The Avengers&quot;.

===North American===
CBS broadcast some of the original format&#x27;s episodes of the programme in 1961 under the &quot;Danger Man&quot; title as a summer replacement for the Western series &quot;&quot;.

&quot;Danger Man&quot; was rebroadcast on American TV in the 2000s, when STARZ!&#x27;s Mystery channel started broadcasting the one-hour episodes in its American CBS broadcast version under the &quot;Secret Agent&quot; title. Prior to this, &quot;Secret Agent&quot; was widely seen in syndication. The half-hour &quot;Danger Man&quot; episodes were not as widely distributed.

In September 2018, Charge! began airing the series in its original UK format beginning with the second season.

In Canada, the series was broadcast under its original title, &quot;Danger Man&quot;.

==DVD==
All episodes have been released.&lt;ref name=&quot;networkdvd/1021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;networkdvd/438&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<doc id="265164" wikidata="Q6230083" url="?curid=265164" title="John Drake (Danger Man)">
<text>John Drake is a fictional secret agent, played by Patrick McGoohan in the British television series &quot;Danger Man&quot; (1960–1962, 1964–1966) (known in the US as &quot;Secret Agent&quot;). 

==Overview==
===Nationality and employment===
Drake&#x27;s background was never explored in detail in the series, and also appeared to undergo an amount of retconning involving his nationality. In the first &quot;Danger Man&quot; series (1960–61), Drake speaks with a posh transatlantic accent, and is described as being an Irish American. In this series he&#x27;s an operative working for a branch of NATO. In the second series (1964–66), Drake speaks with a less pronounced accent that is more British with Irish undertones which was McGoohan&#x27;s natural accent. In this later version, he works for a fictional British secret service branch called M9; no further reference is made to him being American. He is now said to be British, except in one episode in which he identifies himself as being Irish.

===Personality===
In both versions of the series, Drake is depicted as something of a lone wolf and a maverick. In one early episode, he initially refuses a mission that requires him to assassinate a man; he reluctantly takes the mission and is visibly upset when his target is accidentally shot during a struggle. Other episodes (particularly during the later series) have him clashing with his superiors, or at least strongly disagreeing with their methods. In the history of the series, Drake is shown only once intentionally shooting anyone to death, and then only in self-defence. (He is shown shooting people on another occasion, but only during a dream sequence; the aforementioned early episode shooting is depicted as being unintended). Drake was not opposed to using lethal force when absolutely necessary, however, and on rare occasions did kill villains using other methods (throwing off a train, causing the collision of two airplanes, etc.).

===Associates===
Drake is most often shown working alone, having received his orders from unidentified officials (or sometimes stumbling upon a case by himself). During the 1960–62 series, he is shown occasionally answering to a British superior named Hardy and in one episode Drake&#x27;s Washington, DC office is shown and it is learned that he has a secretary. The first season of the 1964–66 series sees Drake receiving orders from Hobbs, a somewhat cold M9 official who is always seen fiddling with a letter opener. In the following season his superior is a former brigadier, Gorton. During the final full season, Drake is on his own, except for one episode in which he takes orders from an M-like character played by Bernard Lee who played M in many of the James Bond films. In one episode of the third series, viewers are introduced to a group of M9 technicians who support Drake&#x27;s missions, including a Q-like gadget man and a wardrobe supervisor.

===Romance===
Drake is almost never shown becoming romantically involved with his leading ladies. This was a requirement put in place by McGoohan who did not want Drake to become a clone of James Bond in that respect. McGoohan allowed a couple of exceptions (particularly in two episodes guest starring Susan Hampshire, both of which imply Drake and the two different characters played by Hampshire continue a relationship &quot;off camera&quot;) and there is a considerable amount of sexual tension present in other episodes. In &quot;The Black Book&quot;, an episode in which Drake becomes attracted to a young woman involved in a spy ring, it is learned that Drake cannot allow himself to become involved with anyone due to his line of work; this is graphically illustrated in the American version of the opening credits which depict a female form being separated from Drake by a set of bars.

==&quot;The Prisoner&quot; connection==
McGoohan denied that the character of Number Six in &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, the show that McGoohan did after &quot;Danger Man&quot;, was meant to be Drake. His co-creator of &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, George Markstein, claimed otherwise. The debate over the identity of Number Six stems from references in dialogue to the character being a former agent, the appearance of &quot;Potter&quot;, a character from the final season of &quot;Danger Man&quot;, and the fact one episode (&quot;The Girl Who Was Death&quot;) was based upon a script originally written for &quot;Danger Man&quot;. Interestingly, a member of the supporting cast for this episode was called ‘&#x27;John Drake&#x27;’. Some of the officially licensed novels based upon the series refer to Number Six as &quot;Drake&quot;, including &quot;Number Two&quot; (1969) by David McDaniel which does so in the very first line of the book.

<text>Project Rastko — Internet Library of Serb Culture () is a non-profit and non-governmental publishing, cultural and educational project dedicated to Serb and Serb-related arts and humanities. It is named after Rastko Nemanjić.

==Project==
The project was established in 1997 as a part of a pan-regional Balkans Cultural Network Initiative . Its main activities are:
* electronic publishing in the fields of Serbian and Serbian-related arts and humanities
* scientific and cultural conferences and studies about Balkan cultural-civilizational integration 
* bilateral and multilateral activities with other Balkan and world countries
* establishing regional centres
* technical training

The apex of the project is its electronic library with more than half a gigabyte of material, comprising electronic books and articles, photographs and comics. Although most texts are Serbian, there is a body of material in other languages, again mostly in English and Russian, but also in French, German, Spanish, and other languages. 

The library contains material in both the public domain and copyrighted texts published with the authors&#x27; permissions, dating from earliest medieval Serb texts to contemporary science fiction. The site of the project also hosts several sites not directly related to the project.

Project Rastko also hosts the European version of Distributed Proofreaders, which intends to supply Project Gutenberg with public domain texts in European languages. Project Rastko is organising a coalition of European e-libraries for the purpose of collecting public domain works, aiming to eventually have a node of Distributed Proofreaders in each European country.

==Centres==
Currently (2007) the project has following regional centres:

# Denmark (Projekt Rastko — Denmark, network of electronic libraries and achievements regarding Danish culture and Danish-Serbian cultural and historical links)
# Republic of Macedonia (Project Rastko — Macedonia, electronic library of culture and tradition of Macedonia)
# Russia (Project Rastko — Russia)
# The Drina (Project Rastko — The Drina, electronic library of culture and tradition of the Drina)
# Kashubians (Project Rastko — Kashubia, e-library of culture and tradition of Kashubians)

<text>The Slovaks ( , singular: &quot;Slovák&quot; , feminine: &quot;Slovenka&quot; , plural: &quot;Slovenky&quot;) are a West Slavic ethnic group and nation native to Slovakia who share a common ancestry, culture, history and speak the Slovak language.

In Slovakia, 4.4 million are ethnic Slovaks of 5.4 million total population. There are Slovak minorities in many neighboring countries including Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine and sizeable populations of immigrants and their descendants in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, United Kingdom and the United States among others, which are collectively referred to as the Slovak diaspora.

== Name ==

The name &quot;Slovak&quot; is derived from &quot;*Slověninъ&quot;, plural &quot;*Slověně&quot;, the old name of the Slavs (Proglas, around 863). The original stem has been preserved in all Slovak words except the masculine noun; the feminine noun is &quot;Slovenka&quot;, the adjective is &quot;slovenský&quot;, the language is &quot;slovenčina&quot; and the country is &quot;Slovensko&quot;. The first written mention of adjective &quot;slovenský&quot; (Slovak) is in 1294 (&quot;ad parvam arborem nystra slowenski breza ubi est meta&quot;).

The original name of Slovaks &quot;Slověninъ&quot;/&quot;Slověně&quot; was still recorded in Pressburg Latin-Czech Dictionary (the 14th century), but it changed to &quot;Slovák&quot; under the influence of Czech and Polish (around 1400). The first written mention of new form in the territory of present-day Slovakia is from Bardejov (1444, &quot;Nicoulaus Cossibor hauptman, Nicolaus Czech et Slowak, stipendiarii supremi&quot;). The mentions in Czech sources are older (1375 and 1385). The change is not related to the ethnogenesis of Slovaks, but exclusively to linguistic changes in the West Slavic languages. The word &quot;Slovak&quot; was used also later as a common name for all Slavs in Czech, Polish, and also Slovak together with other forms.

In Hungarian, &quot;Slovak&quot; is &quot;Tót&quot; (pl: &quot;tótok&quot;), an exonym. It was originally used to refer to all Slavs including Slovenes and Croats, but eventually came to refer primarily to Slovaks. Many place names in Hungary such as Tótszentgyörgy, Tótszentmárton, and Tótkomlós still bear the name. Tóth is a common Hungarian surname.

The Slovaks have also historically been variously referred to as &quot;Slovyenyn&quot;, &quot;Slowyenyny&quot;, &quot;Sclavus&quot;, &quot;Sclavi&quot;, &quot;Slavus&quot;, &quot;Slavi&quot;, &quot;Winde&quot;, &quot;Wende&quot;, or &quot;Wenden&quot;. The final three terms are variations of the Germanic term Wends, which was historically used to refer to any Slavs living close to Germanic settlements.

== Ethnogenesis ==

The early Slavs came to the territory of Slovakia in several waves from the 5th and 6th centuries and were organized on a tribal level. Original tribal names are not known due to the lack of written sources before their integration into higher political units. Weakening of tribal consciousness was probably accelerated by Avars, who did not respect tribal differences in the controlled territory and motivated remaining Slavs to join together and to collaborate on their defense. In the 7th century, Slavs founded a larger tribal union: Samo&#x27;s empire. Regardless of Samo&#x27;s empire, the integration process continued in other territories with various intensities.

The final fall of the Avar Khaganate allowed new political entities to arise. The first such political unit documented by written sources is the Principality of Nitra, one of the foundations of later common ethnic consciousness. At this stage in history it is not yet possible to assume a common identity of all ancestors of Slovaks in the neighboring eastern territories, even if it was inhabited by closely related Slavs. The Principality of Nitra became a part of Great Moravia, a common state of Moravians (Czech ancestors were joined only for a few years). The relatively short existence of Great Moravia prevented it from suppressing differences which resulted from its creation from two separate entities, and therefore a common &quot;Slovak-Moravian&quot; ethnic identity failed to develop. The early political integration in the territory of present-day Slovakia was, however, reflected in linguistic integration. While dialects of the early ancestors of Slovaks were divided into West Slavic (western and eastern Slovakia) and non-West Slavic (central Slovakia), between the 8th and 9th centuries both dialects merged, thus laying the foundations of a later Slovak language.

The 10th century is a milestone in the Slovak ethnogenesis. The fall of Great Moravia and further political changes supported their formation into a separate nation. At the same time, with the extinction of the Proto-Slavic language, between the 10th and 13th centuries Slovak evolved into an independent language (simultaneously with other Slavic languages). The early existence of the Kingdom of Hungary positively influenced the development of common consciousness and companionship among Slavs in the Northern Hungary, not only within boundaries of present-day Slovakia. The clear difference between Slovaks and Hungarians made adoption of a specific name unnecessary and Slovaks preserved their original name (in Latin e.g. &quot;Slavus&quot;), which was also used in communication with other Slavic peoples (Polonus, Bohemus, Ruthenus). In political terms, the medieval Slovaks were a part of the multi-ethnic political nation &quot;Natio Hungarica&quot;, together with Hungarians (or, more exactly, Magyars), Slavonians, Germans, Romanians and other ethnic groups in the Kingdom of Hungary. Since a medieval political nation did not consist of ordinary people but nobility, membership of the privileged class was necessary for all these peoples (&quot;nobiles Hungary&quot;).

Like other nations, the Slovaks began to transform into a modern nation from the 18th century under the idea of national romanticism. The modern Slovak nation is the result of radical processes of modernization within the Habsburg Empire which culminated in the middle of the 19th century. The transformation process was slowed down by conflict with Hungarian nationalism and the ethnogenesis of the Slovaks become a political question, particularly regarding their deprivation and preservation of their language and national rights. In 1722, Michal Bencsik, professor of law at the University of Trnava, published a theory that nobility and burghers of Trenčín should not have same privileges as Hungarians, because they are descendants of Svatopluk&#x27;s people (inferior to Magyars). Neither Bencsik nor his Slovak opponent Ján Baltazár Magin put the continuity of settlement into serious question. Also, the first history of Slovaks written by Georgius Papanek (or Juraj Papánek), traced the roots of the Slovaks to Great Moravia in &quot;Historia gentis Slavae. De regno regibusque Slavorum...&quot; (1780) (&quot;History of the Slovak nation: On the kingdom and kings of the Slovaks&quot;). Papánek&#x27;s work became a basis for argumentation of the Slovak national revival movement. However, the Slovak national revival not only accepted the continuity of population but also emphasized it, thus proving that Slovaks are equal citizens of the state and neither a Hungarian &quot;unique statesmanlike gift&quot; nor Christianization was required for the foundation of the state. 

In 1876, Hungarian linguist Pál Hunfalvy published a theory about missing continuity between Slovaks and Slavs before the arrival of the Hungarians. Hunfalvy tried to prove that ancestors of Slovaks did not live in the territory of the present-day Slovakia before arrival of the old Hungarians (Magyars), but Slovaks emerged later from other Slavs who came to the Kingdom of Hungary from neighbouring countries after the 13th century. János Karácsonyi assumed that central and northern Slovakia were uninhabited (1901) and in his next work &quot;Our historical right to the territorial integrity of our country&quot; (1921) he claimed that the remainder of the original Slavs were assimilated by Magyars and modern Slovaks are descendants of immigrants from Upper Moravia and Oder (the population density on these territories was too low in that time and large numbers of colonists coming from these areas was not possible). The theory was then misused by inter-war Hungarian revisionists, who questioned continuity to support Hungarian claims on Slovakia. In 1982, when rich archaeological evidence proving the opposite was already available, a similar theory was published by Hungarian historian György Györffy. Györffy accepted that smaller groups of Slavs could remain in the territory of Slovakia, but stated that the Slovaks&#x27; origin was in sparse settlement of various Slavic groups strengthened by later colonization. According to Ferenc Makk, the medieval Moravians are not the ancestors of Slovaks and the majority of the Slovak people are descended from later Slavic newcomers.
The opposite theory, supporting the supposed former common past of the Czech and Slovak nations, thus also legitimizing the creation of the united Czechoslovak nation, gained political support in inter-war Czechoslovakia. Like Karácsonyi, Czech historian Václav Chaloupecký assumed that northern and central parts of Slovakia remained uninhabited until the 13th century and that the south-western part was inhabited by Czechs. Yet, in 1946 Chaloupecký assumed that the Slovak nation emerged from neighboring Slavs and had been formed only in the 17th century. His theory about the lack of population in the greater part of Slovakia covered by forests had already been scientifically refuted by Daniel Rapant (e.g. in &quot;O starý Liptov&quot;, 1934), and was proven wrong by numerous archaeological finds and rejected by Czechoslovak historiography. On the other hand, inter-war Slovak autonomists, opposing ethnic Czechoslovakism, dated the existence of the Slovak nation to the time of Pribina (trials to document existence of Slovaks in early Slavic era, i.e. in the time of Samo&#x27;s empire, are marginal and exist outside of modern mainstream Slovak historiography).

After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the formation of independent Slovakia motivated interest in a particularly Slovak national identity. One reflection of this was the rejection of the common Czechoslovak national identity in favour of a purely Slovak one.

== History ==
=== Slavs of the Pannonian Basin ===

The first known Slavic states on the territory of present-day Slovakia were the Empire of Samo and the Principality of Nitra, founded sometime in the 8th century.

=== Great Moravia ===

Great Moravia (833 – 902-907) was a Slavic state in the 9th and early 10th centuries, whose creators were the ancestors of the Czechs and Slovaks. Important developments took place at this time, including the mission of Byzantine monks Cyril and Methodius, the development of the Glagolitic alphabet (an early form of the Cyrillic script), and the use of Old Church Slavonic as the official and literary language. Its formation and rich cultural heritage have attracted somewhat more interest since the 19th century.

The original territory inhabited by the Slavic tribes included not only present-day Slovakia, but also parts of present-day Poland, southeastern Moravia and approximately the entire northern half of present-day Hungary.

=== Kingdom of Hungary ===
The territory of present-day Slovakia was split in two parts between the Kingdom of Hungary (under Hungarian rule gradually from 907 to the early 14th century) to Upper Hungary and Royal Hungary (under the Habsburgs from 1527 – 1848 (see also Hungarian Revolution of 1848)) until the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918. However, according to other historians, from 895 to 902, the whole area of the present-day Slovakia became part of the rising Principality of Hungary, and became (without gradation) part of the Kingdom of Hungary a century later. A separate entity called Nitra Frontier Duchy, existed at this time within the Kingdom of Hungary. This duchy was abolished in 1107. The territory inhabited by the Slovaks in present-day Hungary was gradually reduced.

When most of Hungary was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1541 (see Ottoman Hungary), the territory of present-day Slovakia became the new center of the reduced kingdom that remained under Hungarian, and later Habsburg rule, officially called Royal Hungary. Some Croats settled around and in present-day Bratislava for similar reasons. Also, many Germans settled in the Kingdom of Hungary, especially in the towns, as work-seeking colonists and mining experts from the 13th to the 15th century. Jews and Gypsies also formed significant populations within the territory. During the period, most of present-day Slovakia was part of Habsburg rule, but Ottoman ruled southern and southeasternmost parts of it.

After the Ottoman Empire was forced to retreat from present-day Hungary around 1700, thousands of Slovaks were gradually settled in depopulated parts of the restored Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Hungary, Romania, Serbia, and Croatia) under Maria Theresia, and that is how present-day Slovak enclaves (like Slovaks in Vojvodina, Slovaks in Hungary) in these countries arose.

After Transylvania, Upper Hungary (present-day Slovakia) was the most advanced part of the Kingdom of Hungary for centuries, but in the 19th century, when Buda/Pest became the new capital of the kingdom, the importance of the territory, as well as other parts within the Kingdom fell, and many Slovaks were impoverished. As a result, hundreds of thousands of Slovaks emigrated to North America, especially in the late 19th and early 20th century (between cca. 1880–1910), a total of at least 1.5 million emigrants.

Slovakia exhibits a very rich folk culture. A part of Slovak customs and social convention are common with those of other nations of the former Habsburg monarchy (the Kingdom of Hungary was in personal union with the Habsburg monarchy from 1867 to 1918).

=== Czechoslovakia ===

People of Slovakia spent most part of the 20th century within the framework of Czechoslovakia, a new state formed after World War I. Significant reforms and post-World War II industrialization took place during this time. Slovak was strongly influenced by Czech during this period.

== Culture ==
The art of Slovakia can be traced back to the Middle Ages, when some of the greatest masterpieces of the country&#x27;s history were created. Significant figures from this period included the many Old Masters, among them the Master Paul of Levoča and Master MS. More contemporary art can be seen in the shadows of Koloman Sokol, Albín Brunovský, Martin Benka, Mikuláš Galanda, Ľudovít Fulla. Julius Koller and Stanislav Filko, in the 21st century Roman Ondak, Blažej Baláž. The most important Slovak composers have been Eugen Suchoň, Ján Cikker, and Alexander Moyzes, in the 21st century Vladimir Godar and Peter Machajdík.

The most famous Slovak names can indubitably be attributed to invention and technology. Such people include Jozef Murgaš, the inventor of wireless telegraphy; Ján Bahýľ, Štefan Banič, inventor of the modern parachute; Aurel Stodola, inventor of the bionic arm and pioneer in thermodynamics; and, more recently, John Dopyera, father of modern acoustic string instruments. Hungarian inventors Joseph Petzval and Ányos Jedlik were born of Slovak fathers.

Slovakia is also known for its polyhistors, of whom include Pavol Jozef Šafárik, Matej Bel, Ján Kollár, and its political revolutionaries, such Milan Rastislav Štefánik and Alexander Dubček.

There were two leading persons who codified Slovak. The first one was Anton Bernolák whose concept was based on the dialect of western Slovakia (1787). It was the enactment of the first national standard language for the Slovaks. The second notable man was Ľudovít Štúr. His formation of Slovak had principles in the dialect of central Slovakia (1843).

The best known Slovak hero was Juraj Jánošík (the Slovak equivalent of Robin Hood). The prominent explorer and diplomat Móric Beňovský, Hungarian transcript Benyovszky was Slovak as well (he comes from Vrbové in present-day Slovakia and is e.g. listed as &quot;nobilis Slavicus – Slovak nobleman&quot; in his secondary school registration).

In terms of sports, the Slovaks are probably best known (in North America) for their ice hockey personalities, especially Stan Mikita, Peter Šťastný, Peter Bondra, Žigmund Pálffy, Marián Hossa and Zdeno Chára. For a list see List of Slovaks. Zdeno Chára is only the second European captain in history of the NHL that led his team to win the Stanley Cup, winning it with the Boston Bruins in the season 2010–11.

For a list of the most notable Slovak writers and poets, see List of Slovak authors.

== Statistics ==
There are approximately 5.4 million autochthonous Slovaks in Slovakia. Further Slovaks live in the following countries (&quot;the list shows estimates of embassies etc. and of associations of Slovaks abroad in the first place, and official data of the countries as of 2000/2001 in the second place&quot;).

The list stems from Claude Baláž, a Canadian Slovak, the current plenipotentiary of the Government of the Slovak Republic for Slovaks abroad (see e.g.: 6):
* United States (1,200,000 / 821,325*) [] – 19th – 21st century emigrants; see also United States Census
* Czech Republic (350,000 / 183,749*) [] – due to the existence of former Czechoslovakia
* Hungary (39,266 / 17,693)
* Canada (100,000 / 50,860) – 19th – 21st century migrants
* Serbia (60,000 / 59,021*) [especially in Vojvodina;] – 18th &amp; 19th century settlers
* Poland (2002) (47,000 / 2,000*) [] – ancient minority and due to border shifts during the 20th century
* Romania (18,000 / 17,199) – ancient minority
* Ukraine (17,000 / 6,397) [especially in Carpathian Ruthenia] – ancient minority and due to the existence of former Czechoslovakia
* France (13,000 / n.a.)
* Australia (12,000 / n.a.) – 20th – 21st century migrants
* Austria (10,234 / 10,234) – 20th – 21st century migrants
* United Kingdom (10,000 / n.a.)
* Croatia (5,000 / 4,712) – 18th &amp; 19th century settlers
* other countries

The number of Slovaks living outside Slovakia in line with the above data was estimated at max. 2,016,000 in 2001 (2,660,000 in 1991), implying that, in sum, there were max. some 6,630,854 Slovaks in 2001 (7,180,000 in 1991) in the world. The estimate according to the right-hand site chart yields an approximate population of Slovaks living outside Slovakia of 1.5 million.

Other (much higher) estimates stemming from the Dom zahraničných Slovákov (House of Foreign Slovaks) can be found on &quot;SME&quot;.

<text>Columbia Law School (CLS) is the law school of Columbia University, a private Ivy League university in New York City.

The school was founded in 1858 as the Columbia College Law School. The university was known for its legal scholarship dating back to the 18th century. Graduates of the university&#x27;s colonial predecessor, King&#x27;s College, include such notable early-American legal figures as John Jay, the first chief justice of the United States, and Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury, who were co-authors of &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot;.

Columbia Law has many distinguished alumni, including United States presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Delano Roosevelt; ten justices of the Supreme Court of the United States; numerous U.S. Cabinet members and presidential advisers; US senators; representatives; governors; and more members of the &quot;Forbes 400&quot; than any other law school in the world.

==History==

===Background===

The teaching of law at Columbia reaches back to the 18th century. Graduates of the university&#x27;s colonial predecessor, King&#x27;s College, included such notable early American judicial figures as John Jay, who would later become the first Chief Justice of the United States. Columbia College appointed its first professor of law, James Kent, in 1793. The lectures of Chancellor Kent in the course of four years had developed into the first two volumes of his Commentaries, the second volume being published November 1827. Kent did not, however, succeed in establishing a law school or department in the college. Thus, the formal instruction of law as a course of study did not commence until the middle of the 19th century.

===Founding===
The Columbia College Law School, as it was then officially called, was founded in 1858. Classes were originally held on Colonnade Row in a building once owned by John Jacob Astor. The first purpose-built law school building was a Gothic Revival structure located on Columbia&#x27;s Madison Avenue campus, which also house the college library. Thereafter, the college became Columbia University and moved north to the neighborhood of Morningside Heights. As Columbia Law Professor Theodore Dwight observed, at its founding the demand for a formal course of study in law was still speculative:

It was considered at that time mainly as an experiment. No institution resembling a law school had ever existed in New York. Most of the leading lawyers had obtained their training in offices or by private reading, and were highly skeptical as to the possibility of securing competent legal knowledge by means of professional schools. Legal education was, however, at a very low ebb. The clerks in the law offices were left almost wholly to themselves. Frequently they were not even acquainted with the lawyers with whom, by a convenient fiction, they were supposed to be studying. Examinations for admission to the bar were held by committees appointed by the courts, who, where they inquired at all, sought for the most part to ascertain the knowledge of the candidate of petty details of practice. In general, the examinations were purely perfunctory. A politician of influence was not readily turned away. Few studied law as a science; many followed it as a trade or as a convenient ladder whereby to rise in a political career.&quot;

Indeed, Columbia Law School was one of the few law schools established in the United States before the Civil War. During the 18th and 19th centuries, most legal education took place in law offices, where young men, serving as apprentices or clerks, were set to copying documents and filling out legal forms under the supervision of an established attorney. For example, in New York John Jay, revolutionary founding father and first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, read law with Benjamin Kissam, whose busy practice kept his clerks occupied in transcribing records, pleadings, and opinions. Jay was fortunate to have attentive supervision because the quality and time of learning the law varied greatly within the profession. Theodore Dwight, who had been head of the law department of Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, believed formal legal education, conducted in the classroom with regular lectures, was far superior to casual law office instruction.

At its founding, four distinct courses of lectures of this class were then established: one on Philology, offered by distinguished scholar and statesman, George P. Marsh; a second by Dr. Francis Lieber, a standard writer upon topics of political science and of international law, then a professor at Columbia College; a third course on Ethics, by Professor Nairne, also of the college; and a fourth on Municipal Law, by Theodore W. Dwight, then Professor of Law in Hamilton College, New York, which at the time already had a flourishing law school. The original course of study to obtain a degree consisted of just two years, rather than the modern standard of three.

The first lecture in the law school was delivered on Monday, November 1, 1858, by Mr. Dwight, at the rooms of the Historical Society. It was an introductory lecture, afterwards printed. The audience consisted mainly of lawyers. It was plain that many of them could be counted upon as friends of a system of legal education. The result was an immediate attendance of 35 students, who showed their intention of pursuing a regular course of study by at once paying a tuition fee for instruction throughout the year. Such assurances were given of a future increase of numbers that it was determined to divide each class at the beginning of the coming year into two sections, for their convenience. The next year, the number of students was 62; in the third year, there were 103. Many of these early students were members of the bar.

In 1860, in order to stimulate excellence in attainments of the students, a series of annual prizes was established, commencing with $250, and diminishing regularly by $50, until the sum of $100 was reached. These were adjudicated by leading members of the bar upon the combined merits of written answers to printed questions, and of essays upon topics selected by the instructors. None could compete for the prizes except those who had fully completed the two years&#x27; course. The questions covered the range of studies for the whole course. Stringent rules were adopted in reference to the answers, so as to secure the absolute fidelity of the candidates in their work.

In 1882, George Henry Schanck graduated from Columbia Law as its first black student. There were a few other black students over the next several decades, including Thomas Ayres Church and James Dickson Carr.

===Dwight Method===

Professor Dwight believed a course of legal study should focus on the application of basic legal principles, as learned through the study of legal treatises, coupled with frequent moot courts which would permit students to demonstrate their proficiency in applying those principles to new legal problems. In this way, Dwight&#x27;s method of teaching diverged significantly from the &quot;case method&quot; which had then been popularized by Dean Langdell of the Harvard Law School which focused on the study of individual cases and the use of inductive reasoning to distill governing legal principles from those cases with little time spent on the practical application of those principles.

Dwight believed that his method was superior to the case method because it helped to create trained legal practitioners ready to enter the profession rather than academics more suited to teaching. In support of his position, Dwight cited the example of legal study throughout the Western World since the Roman empire: It is not out of place in this connection to refer to the chosen methods of acquiring the Roman law, both as sanctioned by great jurists and by imperial authority, after an experience continuing through centuries . . . The Roman jurists had &quot;cases&quot; to deal with, precisely as we do. They were not mere legal philosophers, but disposed of practical and &quot;burning&quot; questions of their time. They were, however, in the habit of referring back to a legal principle in disposing of a concrete case, and believed that great principles could be so stated as to win the attention of students and give them a solid basis for future detailed acquisitions.

By the late 19th century, Dwight&#x27;s method gave way to the case method which by the turn of the 20th century had become the standard curriculum at all of the other premier American law schools at Harvard, Yale and the University of Pennsylvania. In 1891, in response to Columbia&#x27;s adoption of the case method, Dwight and a number of other professors left the law school to found New York Law School in Manhattan&#x27;s Financial District.

===20th century===
After Dwight&#x27;s departure, William Albert Keener of Harvard Law School became dean of the law school from 1891 to 1901 when he was succeeded by George Washington Kirchwey. Future Supreme Court Justice Harlan Fiske Stone graduated from the law school in 1898. While practicing law in New York, he began lecturing at Columbia Law School in 1899 and joined the faculty as a full professor. He subsequently became dean of the law school in 1910 and held the position until 1923 when he left to join Sullivan and Cromwell as a partner. Stone became Attorney General of the United States in 1924 and held that Office for almost a year before joining the Supreme Court of the United States as an associate justice.

Columbia allowed women to enroll in 1927. In 1945, Elreta Alexander-Ralston became the first black woman to graduate from Columbia, followed the next year by Constance Baker Motley. Ruth Bader Ginsburg graduated in 1959, and became the first tenured law professor at Columbia in 1972, as well as the second woman ever on the U.S. Supreme Court.

In the 1920s and 30s, the law school soon became known for the development of the legal realism movement. Among the major realists affiliated with Columbia Law School were Karl Llewellyn, Felix S. Cohen and William O. Douglas.

In September 1988, Columbia Law School founded the first AIDS Law Clinic in the country, taught by Professor Deborah Greenberg and Mark Barnes.

== Academics ==

=== Centers ===
Columbia University was among the first schools to establish both comparative and international law centers, as well as an effective space law department. The law school also has major centers for the study of international law, including the Center for Chinese Legal Studies, the Center for Korean Legal Studies, the Center for Japanese Legal Studies, the European Legal Studies Center, the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, the Center on Corporate Governance, the Center for Gender &amp; Sexuality Law, the Center for Law and Economic Studies, the Center on Global Legal Transformation], as well as several other centers and law programs. In July 2012, the law school launched the Ira M. Millstein Center for Global Markets and Corporate Ownership to &quot;study global financial markets and their diverse, interdependent actors&quot;; the Center for Constitutional Governance to &quot;bring together a dynamic roster of constitutional scholars who are deeply engaged in the study of governmental structure and relationships, including experts on separation of powers and issues of federalism&quot;; and the Center for International Commercial and Investment Arbitration to &quot;further the teaching and study of international arbitration, building on the Law School&#x27;s considerable expertise in this rapidly growing area of legal practice.&quot;

=== Academic programs ===

==== Externships ====
On May 26, 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Judge Sonia Sotomayor, a Lecturer-in-Law since 1999, to be a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Judge Sotomayor created and co-taught a course entitled &quot;The Federal Appellate Externship&quot; every semester at the law school since the fall 2000. Federal Appellate Externships and many other externships, including Federal District Externships, are offered each year at Columbia Law.

Among other externships, the law school offers a full-semester externship on the federal government in Washington, D.C., which provides students hands-on experience in government law offices. In addition to their placements at federal agencies, students in the program are also required to attend a weekly seminar and write a substantive research paper. The Federal Government Externship has the following three specific components:

# Field Placements: Students are required to work a minimum of 30 hours a week doing substantive legal work at a federal agency. Options include, amongst others, several sections of the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Communications Commission, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Homeland Security,
# Seminar: Students conduct an in-depth analysis of the roles lawyers play in federal offices. Each seminar is taught by Columbia Law faculty and a Washington-based adjunct professor. Each seminar also features guest speakers and has a substantive writing component.
# Supervised Research: Students are required to produce an 8,000–10,000-word research paper on a topic closely connected to their externship and field placement. Externs are encouraged to consult with the agency in which they work to develop their topic.

==== Legal studies ====
Columbia offers a Graduate Legal Studies Program, including the Master of Laws (LL.M.) and the Doctor of the Science of Law (J.S.D.) degrees. The LL.M. Program is considered one of the best in the United States and has been ranked very highly according to private studies. Each year the law school enrolls approximately 210 graduate students from more than 50 countries with experience in all areas of the legal profession, including academia, the judiciary, public service, civil rights and human rights advocacy, non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and private practice. Graduate students are an important component of the law school community. They participate in many co-curricular activities, including student journals, moot courts, and student organizations. Graduate students also organize and speak at conferences, workshops, and colloquia on current legal issues.

==== Clinical programs ====
The law school runs several clinical programs that contribute to the community, including the nation&#x27;s first technology-based clinic, called Lawyering in the Digital Age. This clinic is currently engaged in building a community resource to understand the collateral consequences of criminal charges. In April 2006, Columbia announced that it was starting the nation&#x27;s first clinic in sexuality and gender law. The Sexuality and Gender Law Clinic &quot;is the first law school clinic anywhere in the U.S. directed by a full-time law school faculty member and dedicated to legal and public policy issues related to gender and sexuality.&quot; In 2007, Columbia opened a new program in law and technology.

==== Joint degrees ====

===== Within the university =====
In December 2010, the law school announced the addition of an accelerated JD/MBA joint degree program, which allows students to obtain both a JD and MBA within three years. The accelerated program will not replace the existing four-year JD/MBA joint degree program. Interested students will be able to choose between the two programs. A joint degree can prove to be beneficial to law students&#x27; career objectives. To enable interested students to achieve this goal, the law school may approve a joint degree with any of the following of Columbia&#x27;s graduate or professional schools:
* Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (Ph.D. in selected programs)
* School of Business
* School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA)
* Graduate School of Journalism
* School of the Arts
* School of Public Health
* School of Social Work
* School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation

===== Study abroad =====
Columbia has cultivated alliances and dual degree programs with overseas law schools, including the University of Oxford, King&#x27;s College London, University College London, and the London School of Economics in London, England; the &quot;Institut d&#x27;études politiques de Paris&quot; (&quot;Sciences Po&quot;) and the &quot;Université Panthéon-Sorbonne&quot; in Paris, France; the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands; and the Institute for Law and Finance (ILF) at Goethe University Frankfurt in Frankfurt, Germany. The double degree options include JD/Masters in French Law (4 year program in Paris), JD/Masters Program in Global Business (3 Year program in Paris), JD/LLM (3 year program in London), LLB/JD (4 year program in London), and JD/LLM (4 year program in Frankfurt).

Columbia Law School has one of the largest international alliances with China, and with Peking University, specifically, a joint exchange program that began in 2006, when students could be exchanged for a semester, which was expanded as a program in 2011 to allow faculty to teach or co-teach courses abroad, and which was expanded as a program again in 2013 when Columbia Law School dean David Schizer and Peking University Law School dean Zhang Shouwen signed a memorandum of understanding between the universities, allowing for joint publications and joint seminars between faculty at the respective universities.

=== Rankings ===

Since &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; began ranking law schools in 1987, Columbia Law had always been rated in the top five (along with Yale, Harvard, and Stanford) until several top law schools, including Columbia Law, declined to continue submitting data to the rankings publication in 2023. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; consistently places Columbia Law among the top law schools (for both academic reputation and national standing) and most recently ranked Columbia Law 8th (tied with University of Virginia School of Law). For 2021, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranks Columbia Law No. 1 for Business/Corporate Law and No. 1 for Contracts/Commercial Law and No. 4 in its Law Firm Recruiters&#x27; Ranking of Best Law Schools.

According to Columbia Law School&#x27;s 2021 ABA-required disclosures; 98.3 percent of the Class of 2021 obtained employment within ten months of graduation.

Since 2014, the law school has been ranked No. 1 on the &quot;National Law Journal&quot;″s &quot;Go to Law Schools&quot; ranking, which measures the percentage of graduates securing employment at the largest 100 law firms in the U.S.

In 2012, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked Columbia Law No. 1 for Best Law Schools for Career Prospects as well as No. 1 for Highest Earning Law Graduates. and QS World University Rankings ranked it the fifth-best law school in the world.

=== Facilities ===
Columbia Law School&#x27;s main building, Jerome L. Greene Hall, was designed by Wallace Harrison and Max Abramovitz, architects of the United Nations Headquarters and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts (which for many years served as the site of Columbia Law School&#x27;s graduation ceremonies). It is located at the intersection of Amsterdam Avenue and West 116th Street. One of the building&#x27;s defining features is its frontal sculpture, &quot;Bellerophon Taming Pegasus&quot;, designed by Jacques Lipchitz, symbolizing man&#x27;s struggle over (his own) wild side/unreason.

In 1996, the law school was given an extensive renovation and expansion by Polshek Partnership (now Ennead Architects), including the addition of a new entrance façade and three story skylit lobby, as well as the expansion of existing space to include an upper-level students&#x27; commons, lounge areas, and a café. In the summer of 2008, construction of a new floor in Jerome Greene Hall was completed providing 38 new faculty offices. Other Columbia Law School buildings include William and June Warren Hall, the Jerome Greene Annex (which Jerome Greene&#x27;s representatives politely declined to have renamed after the building of Jerome Greene Hall), and William C. Warren Hall (or &quot;Little Warren&quot;).

Lenfest Hall, the law school&#x27;s premier residence, opened in August 2003. The hall was named for H. F. Lenfest &#x27;58 and his wife Marguerite. Lenfest contains more than 200 luxury student residences, including private studio apartments and one-bedroom apartments. In addition to Lenfest Hall, the majority of Columbia Law students live in the university&#x27;s Graduate Student Housing consisting of single and shared apartments in buildings throughout Morningside Heights. All Columbia Law students are guaranteed housing on campus for the duration of their law school studies.

The school reported in December 2020 that its Center for Chinese Legal Studies will be named for Hong Yen Chang, the school&#x27;s first Chinese graduate in 1886, and the country&#x27;s first Chinese American lawyer.

==== Arthur W. Diamond Library ====
Columbia Law School&#x27;s Arthur W. Diamond Library is one of the most comprehensive libraries in the world and is the third largest private academic law library in the United States, with over 1,000,000 volumes and subscriptions to more than 7,450 journals and other serials.

== Student life ==

=== Student journals ===
The &quot;Columbia Law Review&quot; is the third-most-cited law journal in the world and is one of the four publishers of the &quot;Bluebook&quot;.

Columbia Law publishes thirteen other student-edited journals, including the &quot;Columbia Business Law Review&quot;, &quot;Columbia Human Rights Law Review&quot; (which in turn publishes &quot;A Jailhouse Lawyer&#x27;s Manual&quot;), &quot;Columbia Journal of Asian Law&quot;, &quot;Columbia Journal of Environmental Law&quot;, &quot;Columbia Journal of European Law&quot;, &quot;Columbia Journal of Gender and Law&quot;, &quot;Columbia Journal of Law &amp; the Arts&quot;, &quot;Columbia Journal of Law &amp; Social Problems&quot;, &quot;Columbia Journal of Race &amp; Law&quot;, &quot;Columbia Journal of Tax Law&quot;, &quot;Columbia Journal of Transnational Law&quot;, &quot;Columbia Science and Technology Law Review&quot;, and the &quot;American Review of International Arbitration&quot;.

=== Clerkships ===
Since 2005, 24 Columbia Law alumni have served as judicial clerks at the United States Supreme Court, one of the most distinguished appointments a law school graduate can obtain. This record gives Columbia a ranking of fifth among all law schools for supplying such law clerks for the period 2005–2017. Columbia has placed 135 clerks at the U.S. Supreme Court in its history, one of the top five law schools for clerks; this group includes Lee Bollinger, who clerked for Chief Justice Warren Burger in the 1972 Term, and who was formerly the president of Columbia University.

Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president of the United States and the 25th vice president of the United States, and Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd president of the United States, were students at CLS; neither graduated from CLS, but they both received honorary J.D.s in October 2008. Former President of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, received his LL.M. at Columbia; Giuliano Amato, twice former Prime Minister of Italy (1992–93 and 2000–2001), was also a CLS graduate. Graduates of the law school have served as members of the United States President&#x27;s Cabinet and non-U.S. government executive cabinets, including U.S. Secretary of State, Secretary of Treasury, Secretary of War (now U.S. Secretary of Defense), and Attorney General, among others.

Three of the school&#x27;s graduates have served as Chief Justice of the United States: Charles Evans Hughes, Harlan Fiske Stone, and John Jay. Columbia Law School is the only law school to have graduated more than one chief justice. Ten alumni of Columbia Law School have served on the Supreme Court of the United States, including Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Several alumni have served as United States Solicitor General. There are over 90 current and past members of the U.S. federal courts who have graduated from CLS. Internationally, CLS graduates also have occupied prominent judicial positions, including Shi Jiuyong, former president of the International Court of Justice (ICJ); Xue Hanqin, current member of the ICJ; Giuliano Amato, current member of the Constitutional Court of Italy; Jan Schans Christensen (&#x27;88 LL.M.), current member of the Supreme Court of Denmark; Susan Denham, current Chief Justice, Supreme Court of Ireland; Marvic Leonen (&#x27;04 LL.M.), current member of the Supreme Court of the Philippines; Hironobu Takesaki, current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Japan; Umu Hawa Tejan-Jalloh, current Chief Justice, Supreme Court of Sierra Leone; Karin Maria Bruzelius, former member of the Supreme Court of Norway; Lawrence Collins, former Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom; and Francis M. Ssekandi, former justice of the Supreme Court of Uganda, among others.

Notable legal academics who are graduates of CLS include Barbara Black, Lee Bollinger, Felix S. Cohen, Lawrence Collins, Robert Cover, Samuel Estreicher, E. Allan Farnsworth, Charles Fried, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Harvey Goldschmid, Kent Greenawalt, Jack Greenberg, Geoffrey C. Hazard Jr., Benjamin Kaplan, Jessica Litman, Louis Lusky, Yale Kamisar, Soia Mentschikoff, Richard B. Morris, Paula Franzese, Robert Pitofsky, Barbara Ringer, Lawrence Sager, Michael I. Sovern, Arthur T. Vanderbilt, Charles Warren, Amy Wax, Herbert Wechsler, and Mark D. West.

In 2015, the positions of Attorney General of the United States (Eric Holder), Solicitor General (Don Verrilli), and the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division (Lanny Breuer) were all occupied by graduates of the law school.

CLS alumni are also notable in the arts, business, and elsewhere. For example, civil rights activist, recording artist, and actor Paul Robeson received his law degree from CLS in 1923. Academy Award-winning lyricist and playwright Oscar Hammerstein II attended the law school. Moe Berg was a Major League Baseball player, and a spy for the United States.

Entrepreneur and former 2020 Presidential candidate Andrew Yang is also an alumnus.

<doc id="265182" wikidata="Q269091" url="?curid=265182" title="Tears for Fears">
<text>Tears for Fears are an English pop rock band formed in Bath in 1981 by Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal. Founded after the dissolution of their first band, the mod-influenced Graduate, Tears for Fears were associated with the synth-pop bands of the 1980s, and attained international chart success as part of the Second British Invasion.

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Hurting&quot; (1983), reached number one on the UK Albums Chart, and their first three hit singles – &quot;Mad World&quot;, &quot;Change&quot;, and &quot;Pale Shelter&quot; – all reached the top five in the UK Singles Chart. Their second album, &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot; (1985), reached number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, achieving multi-platinum status in both the US and the UK. The album contained two US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number one hits: &quot;Shout&quot; and &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot;, both of which also reached the top five in the UK with the latter winning the Brit Award for Best British Single in 1986. Their belated follow-up, &quot;The Seeds of Love&quot; (1989), entered the UK chart at number one and yielded the transatlantic top 5 hit &quot;Sowing the Seeds of Love&quot;.

After touring &quot;The Seeds of Love&quot; in 1990, Orzabal and Smith had an acrimonious split. Orzabal retained the Tears for Fears name as a solo project, releasing the albums &quot;Elemental&quot; (1993) – which produced the international hit &quot;Break It Down Again&quot; – and &quot;Raoul and the Kings of Spain&quot; (1995). Orzabal and Smith reconciled in 2000 and released an album of new material, &quot;Everybody Loves a Happy Ending&quot;, in 2004. The duo have toured on a semi-regular basis since then. After being in development for almost a decade, the band&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;The Tipping Point&quot;, was released in 2022, giving the band their sixth UK Top 5 album and their highest chart peak in 30 years, and reaching the Top 10 in numerous other countries, including the US.

In 2021, Orzabal and Smith were honoured with the Ivor Novello Award for &#x27;Outstanding Song Collection&#x27; recognising their &quot;era-defining Tears for Fears albums&quot; and &quot;critically acclaimed, innovative hit singles&quot;.

==History==
===Formation and influences===
Orzabal and Smith met as teenagers in Bath, Somerset, England. Their professional debut came with the band Graduate, a mod revival/new wave act whose influences included the Jam and two-tone music. In 1980, Graduate released an album, &quot;Acting My Age&quot;, and a single &quot;Elvis Should Play Ska&quot; (referring to Elvis Costello). The single just missed the top 100 in the UK, but performed well in Spain and in Switzerland. The band split in 1981. Shortly afterwards, Orzabal and Smith became session musicians for the band Neon, where they first met future Tears for Fears drummer Manny Elias. Neon also featured Pete Byrne and Rob Fisher, who went on to become Naked Eyes. The pair continued working together, drawing inspiration from artists such as Talking Heads, Peter Gabriel and Brian Eno.

Orzabal and Smith were impressed by the synth-pop sound of Gary Numan&#x27;s &quot;Are &#x27;Friends&#x27; Electric?&quot; (1979), aspiring to make such music themselves. Their new electronic direction was assured upon hearing the work of bands like Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), Depeche Mode and the Human League. Post-punk band Joy Division were also influential, inspiring Orzabal to write more introspective and personal songs.

The likes of OMD and Soft Cell had popularised the &quot;duo&quot; presentation within synth-pop, inspiring Orzabal and Smith to package themselves as a two-man unit, initially under the name History of Headaches. The name Tears for Fears was inspired by primal therapy, developed by the American psychologist Arthur Janov, which gained tremendous publicity after John Lennon became Janov&#x27;s patient in 1970. When Orzabal and Smith finally met Janov in the mid-1980s, they were disillusioned to find he had become quite &quot;Hollywood&quot; and wanted the band to write a musical for him.

As Tears for Fears, Orzabal and Smith intended to form the nucleus of the group and bring in surrounding musicians to help them complete the picture. Around this time they met local musician Ian Stanley, who offered them free use of his home 8-track studio. Stanley began working with the duo as their keyboard-player and, after recording two demos, Tears for Fears were signed to Mercury Records in the UK in 1981 by A&amp;R manager Dave Bates. Their first single, &quot;Suffer the Children&quot;, produced by David Lord, was released on that label in November 1981, followed by the first edition of &quot;Pale Shelter&quot; (produced by Mike Howlett) in March 1982, but neither release was successful.

===&quot;The Hurting&quot; and first hit singles (1982–1983)===
The band achieved their first taste of success with their third single, &quot;Mad World&quot;, which reached No. 3 in the UK in November 1982. Their first album, &quot;The Hurting&quot;, was released in March 1983.

The album, produced by Chris Hughes and Ross Cullum, showcased guitar- and synthesizer-based songs with lyrics reflecting Orzabal&#x27;s bitter childhood and his interest in primal therapy. The album was a big success and had a lengthy chart run (65 weeks) in the UK, where it reached No. 1 and platinum status. It also reached the top 20 in several other countries and yielded the international hit singles &quot;Mad World&quot; (top 5 hit in South Africa), &quot;Change&quot; (top 40 hit in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and South Africa – their first single to reach the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100), and a re-recorded version of &quot;Pale Shelter&quot;. All three of these singles reached the Top 5 in the UK.

Towards the end of 1983, the band released a new, slightly more experimental single, &quot;The Way You Are&quot;, intended as a stopgap while they worked on their second album. The single was a top-30 hit in the UK, but did not come close to matching the success of their three previous hits, despite a national concert tour in December of that year (captured on the &quot;In My Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot; live video release). The single, which heavily featured sampling and programmed rhythms, was a departure from Tears for Fears&#x27; previous musical approach. In the liner notes to their 1996 B-sides compilation album &quot;Saturnine Martial &amp; Lunatic&quot; they wrote &quot;this was the point we realised we had to change direction&quot;, though the somewhat experimental style of the single continued to be reflected in their forthcoming B-sides.

===&quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot; and worldwide fame (1984–1986)===

In early 1984, they began working with a new producer, Jeremy Green, on their new single &quot;Mothers Talk&quot;. However, the band were ultimately unhappy with the results and so producer Chris Hughes was brought back into the fold and the &quot;Mothers Talk&quot; single re-produced for release in August 1984. A departure from their earlier works, the single became a top-20 hit in the UK, but it was the follow-up single &quot;Shout&quot; (released in the UK in November 1984) that was the real beginning of the band&#x27;s international fame.

&quot;Shout&quot;, a top-5 UK hit, paved the way for their second album, &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot; (released in February 1985), which entered the UK album chart at No. 2 and remained in the upper reaches of the chart for the next 12 months. They did away with the predominantly synthpop feel of the first album, instead expanding into a more sophisticated sound that would become the band&#x27;s stylistic hallmark. Anchored on the creative hub of Orzabal, Stanley and producer Hughes, the new Tears for Fears sound helped to propel &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot; into becoming one of the year&#x27;s biggest sellers worldwide, eventually being certified triple platinum in the UK and quintuple platinum in the US (where it remained the No. 1 album for five weeks in the summer of 1985).

The album&#x27;s title was inspired by the book and television miniseries &quot;Sybil&quot;, the chronicle of a woman with dissociative identity disorder who sought refuge in her analyst&#x27;s &quot;big chair&quot;, Orzabal and Smith stating they felt each of the album&#x27;s songs had a distinctive personality of its own. The band had also recorded a track titled &quot;The Big Chair&quot;, which was released as the B-side to &quot;Shout&quot; but was not included on the album.

The album&#x27;s success came in conjunction with the array of hit singles it yielded: &quot;Mothers Talk&quot; (re-recorded yet again for its US release in 1986), &quot;Shout&quot; (No. 4 UK, No. 1 in the US, Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and a huge hit in other territories), &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot; (their highest-charting UK and Irish hit at No. 2 and another No. 1 in the US and in Canada), &quot;Head over Heels&quot; (UK No. 12, US No. 3, Ireland No. 5, Canada No. 8), and &quot;I Believe (A Soulful Re-Recording)&quot; (UK No. 23 and Ireland No. 10). Some regions even saw the release of limited edition 10&quot; singles for these hits, and a variety of double packs and picture discs in addition to the regular 7&quot; and 12&quot; formats.

Following the album&#x27;s release, the band went on a world tour that lasted most of the year, playing notably at the &quot;Montreux Golden Rose Rock and Pop Festival&quot; in May 1985. In September 1985, the band performed &quot;Shout&quot; at the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards at the Radio City Music Hall in New York. Also during the tour, Orzabal and Smith discovered an American female singer/pianist, Oleta Adams, who was performing in a Kansas City hotel bar, and whom they invited to collaborate on their next album. Towards the end of the year, they released a video collection/documentary titled &quot;Scenes from the Big Chair&quot;.

In February 1986, having completed the lengthy and exhausting Big Chair world tour, Tears for Fears were honoured at the 1986 Brit Awards in London, where they won the Best British Single award for &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot;. The band was also nominated for Best British Group and Best British Album, and Chris Hughes was nominated for Best Producer. Tears for Fears performed the song at the ceremony, which became the final public performance of drummer Manny Elias who left the group shortly afterwards.

At the same time, the band was nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Duo/Group and Favorite Pop/Rock Duo/Group Video Artist at the 1986 American Music Awards in Los Angeles; performing &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot; during the TV show. And in April, a remixed version of &quot;Mothers Talk&quot; was released in North America, reaching the US Top 30.

The same year, Orzabal and Stanley worked together on a side project named Mancrab and released a single, &quot;Fish for Life&quot;, which was written for the soundtrack of the film &quot;The Karate Kid, Part II&quot;. The track was written and produced by Orzabal and Stanley, and featured vocals by US singer/dancer Eddie Thomas, who was one of the dancers in the video for &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot;.

====Live Aid====
On 13 July 1985, Tears for Fears were scheduled to perform at JFK Stadium in Philadelphia for the Live Aid charity event. However, on the morning of the event, it was announced that the band (who had actually been billed to appear before they had even agreed to do so) had pulled out of the show. They were replaced by blues rock group George Thorogood and the Destroyers, which had a strong Philadelphia-area following. The official reason given for their non-appearance was that two of their backing musicians, guitarist Andrew Sanders and saxophonist Will Gregory, had quit due to the expiration of their contract; they were replaced by Alan Griffiths on guitar and Josephine Wells on saxophone for the remaining bulk of the 1985 world tour. In place of appearing, the band pledged to donate proceeds from their concerts played in Tokyo, Sydney, London and New York.

As a further donation, the band also recorded a slightly rewritten version of one of their biggest hits and released it for the British fundraising initiative Sport Aid in 1986, a sister project of Band Aid in which people took part in running races of varying length and seriousness to raise more money for African famine relief projects. Sport Aid&#x27;s slogan was &quot;I Ran the World&quot;, therefore Tears for Fears released &quot;Everybody Wants to Run the World&quot; (No. 5 in the UK and No. 4 in Ireland). Indirectly, the band were involved in the earlier Band Aid single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; from 1984, which featured a slowed down sample from their song &quot;The Hurting&quot; (from their debut album of the same name) in the introduction.

===&quot;The Seeds of Love&quot; (1987–1990)===
It was 1989 before the group released their third album, &quot;The Seeds of Love&quot; (on which Ian Stanley appeared for the last time as a member of Tears for Fears), at a reported production cost of over a million pounds. With Stanley and Chris Hughes having both left the project and the band early during the recording sessions due to creative differences, the album was written largely by Orzabal along with keyboardist Nicky Holland (who had toured with Tears for Fears on their &quot;Big Chair&quot; world tour in 1985). Moving from various studios and using various sets of producers over many months, the band ultimately decided to scrap the recordings and take the reins themselves with assistance from engineer Dave Bascombe. Much of the material was recorded in jam sessions and later edited down. The length of the production impacted on the band&#x27;s management company, who had financially over-extended themselves in other business matters and were hoping for an earlier release date to pay off their debts.

The album retained the band&#x27;s epic sound while showing increasing influences ranging from jazz and blues to the Beatles, the latter being evident on the hit single &quot;Sowing the Seeds of Love&quot;. The second single from the album was &quot;Woman in Chains&quot; (a top 40 hit in the UK, Canada, France, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden and the US), on which Phil Collins played drums and Oleta Adams—whom Orzabal would later guide to a successful solo career—shared vocals.

The album was a worldwide success, entering the UK Albums Chart at no. 1, making the top 10 in the US and in numerous other countries, eventually going on to sell millions of copies internationally. The band set out on an extensive &quot;Seeds of Love&quot; world tour sponsored by Philips to start recovering the debt incurred during the recording process. The band&#x27;s show in Santa Barbara, California, in May 1990 would be captured on the &quot;Going to California&quot; live video as the singles &quot;Advice for the Young at Heart&quot; and &quot;Famous Last Words&quot; delivered modest chart success.

A 64-page companion book, simply titled &quot;Tears for Fears – The Seeds of Love&quot;, was released by Virgin Books in 1990 and offered extensive insight from Orzabal, Holland and Adams into the songwriting and production process for the album, as well as the musical scores for each track and rare promotional photographs from the era.

===Break-up (1991–1992)===
After &quot;The Seeds of Love&quot;, Orzabal and Smith had an acrimonious falling out and parted company in 1991. The split was blamed on Orzabal&#x27;s perfectionist approach to production and delays caused by Smith&#x27;s jetsetting lifestyle and desire to slow down the pace of their work (Smith was also going through a divorce at the time). Another factor in the break-up was the band&#x27;s manager, Paul King, who declared bankruptcy in 1990 and was later convicted of fraud in 2004.

Following Smith&#x27;s departure, Orzabal kept the band name alive by releasing the 1992 hit single &quot;Laid So Low (Tears Roll Down)&quot;. The single was released to promote the band&#x27;s greatest hits collection &quot;Tears Roll Down (Greatest Hits 82–92)&quot;, which featured every single to reach the Top 20, either in the UK or internationally, apart from the Sport Aid fundraiser. The album peaked at no. 2 in the UK, where it was certified double platinum, and also reached the Top 10 in several other countries, including France, Italy and New Zealand.

===Solo era: &quot;Elemental&quot; and &quot;Raoul and the Kings of Spain&quot; (1993–1996)===
In 1993, Orzabal (still under the name Tears for Fears) released the album &quot;Elemental&quot; together with longtime collaborator Alan Griffiths. Co-produced by Tim Palmer, it yielded the international hit &quot;Break It Down Again&quot; (top 20 in the UK, Canada, France, and Italy) and was supported with another successful world tour, including a college tour of the US where &quot;Break It Down Again&quot; reached no. 25. Although it charted considerably lower in the US than the previous two studio albums (no. 45), it still earned a Gold disc there for sales of over half a million copies.

Orzabal, still working with Griffiths and Palmer, released another Tears for Fears album, &quot;Raoul and the Kings of Spain&quot;, in 1995. This album was a more contemplative work that delved into his own Spanish heritage and showcased a new Latin musical influence (Raoul was originally the name Orzabal&#x27;s parents wanted to give him, and is also the name of his own first son). The album was not a commercial success by Tears for Fears standards, though minor chart success came via the single release of the title track (top 40 in the UK) and (to a lesser extent) the single &quot;God&#x27;s Mistake&quot;.

In 1996 a B-sides compilation album, &quot;Saturnine Martial &amp; Lunatic&quot;, was released on Mercury, which included B-sides and some rare tracks from the successful 1982–93 period.

===Reunion: &quot;Everybody Loves a Happy Ending&quot;===
Around 2000, the duo began talking again after Orzabal helped Smith with some routine legal paperwork. Smith flew back to England (where Orzabal still lived) and they had dinner and decided to work on a new album together.

The songwriting sessions included Charlton Pettus (Smith&#x27;s collaborator since the mid-1990s), and 14 songs were written and recorded in less than six months. After initially being signed to Arista Records by L.A. Reid in 2003, record company mergers and the departure of Reid led to the band opting to terminate the contract. The ensuing album, &quot;Everybody Loves a Happy Ending&quot;, was eventually released in September 2004 on New Door Records in the U.S. Two U.S. tours followed, and the 2004 tour included an unrehearsed guest appearance by Oleta Adams at the Kansas City show for a performance of &quot;Woman in Chains&quot;.

&quot;Everybody Loves a Happy Ending&quot; was released in the UK and Europe in March 2005 on Gut Records, shortly after the comeback single &quot;Closest Thing to Heaven&quot; became the first Tears for Fears UK Top 40 hit in a decade. The promo video for the single was a colourful fantasy that featured Hollywood actress Brittany Murphy riding in a hot air balloon. The European releases of the album contained all fourteen tracks recorded during the recording sessions, while the US version only contained twelve. A brief tour of larger UK venues followed in April.

A live performance at the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris, recorded in June 2005, was released on CD and DVD in France and Benelux. Titled &quot;Secret World – Live in Paris&quot;, it was released on the XIII Bis label in early 2006 and became a best-seller, with over 70,000 physical copies sold in addition to downloads. The CD contained a new studio song, &quot;Floating Down the River&quot;, and a remastered Curt Smith/Mayfield track, &quot;What Are We Fighting For?&quot;.
During this period, &quot;Mad World&quot; was re-recorded by Michael Andrews and Gary Jules for the soundtrack of the 2001&#x27;s film &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;; a 2003 single release of the song reached number one in the UK for three consecutive weeks and won Orzabal his second Ivor Novello Award. This version also reached the Top 40 in numerous other countries between 2003 and 2013.

In 2006, &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot; was re-issued again by Universal Music. It included the rare piano version of &quot;The Working Hour&quot;, which had previously only been available as a limited edition item.

In August 2009, the &quot;Raoul and the Kings of Spain&quot; album was also re-issued by Cherry Red Records, featuring seven bonus B-side tracks from the time of its original release.

===2010–2020===
In April 2010, Tears for Fears joined the reformed 1980s group Spandau Ballet on their seven-date tour of Australia and New Zealand, before a four-date headlining tour of their own in Southeast Asia (Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan) and a 17-date tour of the United States. In 2011 and 2012, they played dates in the US, Japan, South Korea, Manila and South America.

In May 2013, Smith confirmed that he was writing and recording new Tears for Fears material with Orzabal and Charlton Pettus. In August 2013, Tears for Fears released their first newly recorded material in nearly a decade, with a cover of Arcade Fire&#x27;s &quot;Ready to Start&quot; made available on SoundCloud. In 2014, the track was included on a limited edition 3-track 10&quot; vinyl EP from the band called &quot;Ready Boy &amp; Girls?&quot;, released exclusively for Record Store Day, which also featured covers of Hot Chip&#x27;s &quot;Boy from School&quot; and Animal Collective&#x27;s &quot;My Girls&quot;. All three songs were recorded as &quot;kick-start&quot; projects as the band commenced work on their seventh studio album. In an interview on BBC Radio Devon in October 2014, Orzabal stated that the band had now signed to Warner Music Group and that around five or six songs had so far been completed for the new album.

To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Hurting&quot;, Universal Music reissued it in October 2013 in two deluxe editions. Deluxe editions of the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot;, were released on 10 November 2014. On 12 November 2014, Tears for Fears performed &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot; on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; TV programme. In mid 2015, the band began a series of live dates in the United States and Canada.

In July 2016, the band played their first live dates in the UK in over ten years: the Newmarket Nights festival at Newmarket Racecourse on 29 July and a closing night headlining appearance at Camp Bestival at Lulworth Castle in Dorset on 31 July. The gigs marked the band&#x27;s first UK festival appearances since Knebworth in 1990. The band again toured the United States and Canada in September and October 2016.

In 2017, the band toured North America with co-headliners Hall &amp; Oates, and also played in Israel, at the British Summer Time Festival in London&#x27;s Hyde Park on 8 July, and at the Rock in Rio festival in Brazil on 22 September. In a July 2017 interview, Orzabal stated that the band had collaborated with songwriter/producer Sacha Skarbek on their seventh album, &quot;The Tipping Point&quot;, and divulged several song titles from it including &quot;My Demons&quot;, &quot;I Love You but I&#x27;m Lost&quot;, &quot;End of Night&quot; and &quot;Up Above the World&quot;. In an interview with SiriusXM Canada the same month, Orzabal divulged that although the band had signed with Warner Music to release their new album (which had been scheduled for October 2017), Universal Music had then approached Warner Music about buying the rights to the album so that they could release it (Universal being the rights holders of the vast majority of the band&#x27;s back catalogue).

Roland Orzabal&#x27;s wife, Caroline, died in the summer of 2017. Tears for Fears initially withdrew from the remaining shows on their pending North American tour, but they resumed the tour in September 2017 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. During his late wife&#x27;s illness, Orzabal began writing songs that appear on the 2022 Tears for Fears album, &quot;The Tipping Point&quot;.

On 26 October 2017, the band performed a 65-minute live set at the BBC Radio Theatre in London for the Radio 2 in Concert series, which was broadcast on both radio and television (via the BBC Red Button service). The following night, the band played their first &quot;full-length&quot; UK concert since 2005, at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall. Prior to this, on 12 October, &quot;I Love You but I&#x27;m Lost&quot; was released as a single from a new 16-track Tears For Fears compilation album titled &quot;Rule the World: The Greatest Hits&quot;. In October 2017, the band announced an 11-date UK arena tour for April–May 2018, featuring Alison Moyet as the support act. However, the tour was postponed to early 2019 due to Orzabal&#x27;s health problems following the death of his wife.

The band performed at further UK and European festivals in the summer of 2019, starting with the Hampton Court Palace Festival on 18 and 19 June, the Forest Live festival at Delamere Forest on 21 June, and the Nocturne Live Concert Series at Blenheim Palace on 22 June.

In February 2020, &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot; was the subject of an episode of the BBC series &quot;Classic Albums&quot; featuring new interviews with the band and all key personnel from the album&#x27;s creation and subsequent success. To coincide with the album&#x27;s 35th anniversary, the 2014 deluxe boxed set was reissued by Universal Music, as well as a new 12-inch vinyl picture disc of the album.

In October 2020, &quot;The Seeds of Love&quot; album was reissued as various deluxe editions and returned the band to the UK Top 20.

In November 2020, after a change in management, &quot;Everybody Loves a Happy Ending&quot; was made available through various streaming services for the first time.

===&quot;The Tipping Point&quot; and &quot;Songs for a Nervous Planet&quot; (2021–present)===
On 12 June 2021, Tears for Fears released the live double album &quot;Live at Massey Hall&quot; (recorded in 1985) for Record Store Day and in September, Orzabal and Smith were honoured at the Ivor Novello Awards.

On 7 October 2021, Smith appeared on the BBC Radio 2 programme &quot;The Zoe Ball Breakfast Show&quot; to introduce the band&#x27;s single &quot;The Tipping Point&quot;, the first track from their seventh album, &quot;The Tipping Point&quot;, released on Concord Records on 25 February 2022.

In November 2021, Tears for Fears announced a summer tour of the US and UK to commence in May 2022. The band had to cancel the tour before its completion, due to Smith suffering four broken ribs in a road accident in July 2022. Two further singles, &quot;No Small Thing&quot; and &quot;Break the Man&quot;, were released before the album (respectively in early December 2021 and mid-January 2022).

&quot;The Tipping Point&quot; received largely positive reviews from critics and entered the UK Charts at number 2 while topping the UK Album Sales Chart, the UK Physical Albums Sales Chart, the UK Downloads Albums Chart, the UK Vinyl Albums Chart, and also the Scottish regional album chart. It also reached the Top 10 in numerous other countries (entering the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 8) and topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Alternative Albums, Top Rock Albums and Top Album Sales charts.

On 1 June 2022, a video was released for the song &quot;My Demons&quot; (the fourth single from &quot;The Tipping Point&quot;), and while the band was on tour, &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot; re-entered the UK Singles Chart and entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Global 200.

In April 2023, Tears for Fears announced the second part of the Tipping Point World Tour. In June 2023, &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot; returned to the UK Singles Chart once again for an additional 22 week chart run, reaching its peak position at number 72 in September.

On 12 September 2024, Tears for Fears announced the release of the &quot;Songs for a Nervous Planet&quot; album, featuring eighteen live tracks, recorded on 11 July 2023 in Franklin, Tennessee, during the band&#x27;s Tipping Point World Tour, as well as four (or five in some limited editions) new studio tracks. The cover art, described as &quot;mixed media digital collage with AI being just one of the many tools used in the creative process&quot;, was criticized by some fans. Tears for Fears described the cover art as &quot;a vibrant artwork that evoked a sense of sci-fi, futuristic themes, and an escape from what is known&quot;. Two of the new tracks were released as singles from the album before its issue: &quot;The Girl That I Call Home&quot; on 12 September and &quot;Astronaut&quot; on 4 October 2024. &quot;Songs for a Nervous Planet&quot; entered the Top 10 in the UK (becoming the band&#x27;s seventh UK top 10 album) and the Top 40 in several other countries.

<text>The ringed seal (Pusa hispida) is a small earless seal species found in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. Its common name is derived from a distinctive patterning of dark spots surrounded by light gray rings. 

The ringed seal is the most abundant and wide-ranging ice seal in the Northern Hemisphere; they can be found throughout the Arctic Ocean, into the Bering Sea and Okhotsk Sea as far south as the northern coast of Japan in the Pacific, and throughout the North Atlantic coasts of Greenland and Scandinavia as far south as Newfoundland. Two freshwater subspecies live in northern Europe. They are the smallest members of the seal family found in these regions, averaging in length. 

The average lifespan of a ringed seal is 40 years. They have a solitary lifestyle, and their diet consists mostly of Arctic cod and planktonic crustaceans. They are a primary prey of polar bears – which are their primary predator – and killer whales, and have long been a component of the diet of indigenous people of the Arctic. 

Recently, the biggest threat to ringed seals has been the changing temperature in the Arctic and the detrimental changes to sea ice that follow. Declines in snowpack and sea ice due to increasing ocean temperatures and atmospheric temperatures poses a threat to their survival. However, some projections indicate that the extinction of their predators due to warming may ultimately allow ringed seal numbers to thrive. 

==Description==

The ringed seal is the smallest and most common seal in the Arctic, with a small head, short cat-like snout, and a plump body. Its coat is dark with silver rings on the back and sides and a silver belly, giving this seal its vernacular name. Depending on subspecies and condition, adult size can range from and adult weight can vary from . Its average length is about long, with an average weight of about . Though it is generally considered the smallest species in the true seal family, several related species, especially the Baikal seal, may approach similarly small dimensions. Their small front flippers have claws more than 2.5 cm (1 in) thick that are used to maintain breathing holes through ice sheets as thick as 6 ft (1.8 m).

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==

The taxonomy of the ringed seal has been much debated and revised in the literature. Due to its wide range, as many as ten subspecies have been described. Currently, five distinct subspecies are recognized: &quot;P. h. hispida&quot; in the Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea, &quot;P. h. ochotensis&quot; in the Sea of Okhotsk, &quot;P. h. saimensis&quot; in Lake Saimaa in Finland, &quot;P. h. ladogensis&quot; in nearby Lake Ladoga in Russia and &quot;P. h. botnica&quot; in the Gulf of Bothnia. The ringed seal is most closely related to the Caspian seal (&quot;P. caspica&quot;) and Baikal seal (&quot;P. sibirica&quot;), all of which share similar small sizes, features of skull morphology and affinity for ice.

The closest phylogenetic relatives to the genus &quot;Pusa&quot; are the grey seal (&quot;Halichoerus grypus&quot;) and the species in the genus &quot;Phoca&quot; (the harbor seal and largha seal), in which ringed seals were formerly classified. Together with the remaining northern latitude ice seals (ribbon seal, bearded seal, harp seal and hooded seal), these seals constitute the subfamily, Phocinae.

===Subspecies===
The populations living in different areas have evolved to separate subspecies, which are currently recognized as:
The three last subspecies are isolated from the others, like the closely related Baikal seal and Caspian seal.

==Range and habitat==

Ringed seals occur throughout the Arctic Ocean. They can be found in the Baltic Sea, the Bering Sea and the Hudson Bay. They prefer to rest on ice floe and will move farther north for denser ice. Two subspecies, &quot;P. h. saimensis&quot; and &quot;ladogensis&quot;, can be found in freshwater.

Ringed seals have a circumpolar distribution from approximately 35°N to the North Pole, occurring in all seas of the Arctic Ocean. In the North Pacific, they are found in the southern Bering Sea and range as far south as the seas of Okhotsk and Japan. Throughout their range, ringed seals have an affinity for ice-covered waters and are well adapted to occupying seasonal and permanent ice. They tend to prefer large floes (i.e., &gt; 48 m in diameter) and are often found in the interior ice pack where the sea ice coverage is greater than 90%. They remain in contact with ice most of the year and pup on the ice in late winter-early spring.

Ringed seals are found throughout the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Bering Seas, as far south as Bristol Bay in years of extensive ice coverage. During late April through June, ringed seals are distributed throughout their range from the southern ice edge northward. Preliminary results from recent surveys conducted in the Chukchi Sea in May–June 1999 and 2000 indicate that ringed seal density is higher in nearshore fast and pack ice, and lower in offshore pack ice. Results of surveys conducted by Frost and Lowry (1999) indicate that, in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, the density of ringed seals in May–June is higher to the east than to the west of Flaxman Island. The overall winter distribution is probably similar, and it is believed there is a net movement of seals northward with the ice edge in late spring and summer. Thus, ringed seals occupying the Bering and southern Chukchi seas in winter apparently are migratory, but details of their movements are unknown.

Ringed seals reside in arctic waters and are commonly associated with ice floes and pack ice. The ringed seal maintains a breathing hole in the ice thus allowing it to use ice habitat that other seals cannot.

==Life history==

Females reach sexual maturity at 4 years old while males do not reach maturity until 7 years old. During the spring breeding season, females construct lairs within the thick ice and give birth in these structures. Females give birth to a single pup on ice floes or shorefast ice in March or April after a 9-month gestation period. Pups are weaned after two months and build up a thick layer of blubber.

Females usually begin mating in late April. Males will roam the ice for a mate. When found, the male and female may spend several days together before mating, after which the male looks for another mate.

Ringed seals live about 25 to 30 years. They are solitary animals and when hauled out on ice, they separate themselves from each other by hundreds of yards.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
Ringed seals eat a wide variety of small prey that consists of 72 species of fish and invertebrates. Feeding is usually a solitary behavior and their prey of choice includes mysids, shrimp, arctic cod, and herring. While feeding, ringed seals dive to depths of . In the summer ringed seals feed along edge of the sea-ice on polar cod. In shallow water they feed on smaller cod. Ringed seals may also eat herring, smelt, whitefish, sculpin, perch, and crustaceans.

===Predators===
Ringed seals are an important food item in particular for polar bears. During the pupping season, Arctic fox and glaucous gulls take ringed seal pups born outside lairs while killer whales, Greenland sharks and occasionally Atlantic walruses prey upon them in the water.

==Human interactions==
Ringed seals have long been an important component of the diet of Arctic indigenous peoples throughout their range, and continue to be harvested annually by many communities. Early Paleoeskimo sites in Arctic Canada revealed signs of harvested ringed seals dating from c. 4000–3500 BP, likely captured in frozen cracks and leads in the ice, with a selection for juveniles and young adults.

In 2012 the Government of Nunavut warned pregnant women to avoid eating ringed seal liver due to elevated levels of mercury, although they stressed eating traditional &quot;country food&quot; is still healthy for adults.

Bycatch in fishing gear, such as commercial trawls, is a threat to ringed seals. Climate change is potentially the most serious threat to ringed seal populations since much of their habitat is dependent upon pack ice.

=== Conservation in the United States ===

The estimated population size for the Alaska stock of ringed seals is 249,000 animals. In 2010 the trend in numbers for this population was unknown. Ringed seals are listed as a species of &quot;least concern&quot; by the IUCN, and were considered &#x27;not threatened&#x27; under the Endangered Species Act in 2006. Reliable estimates of the minimum population, potential biological removal, and human-caused mortality were not available in 2006. The level of annual U.S. commercial fishery-related mortality or injury was considered insignificant. The Alaska stock of ringed seals is not considered a strategic fishery stock. In 2008 the US National Marine Fisheries Service began a conservation status review under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to determine if listing this seal under the ESA is warranted.

== Climate change ==

Ringed seals reside within 35°N and the North Pole, and are thus known as a circumpolar based species. Climate change is projected to affect both polar regions more than anywhere else. This means a changing climate and life for all those residing in these polar regions. As for ringed seals, two potential outcomes lie ahead in this ever-changing climate.

=== Threats ===

In the past decade, the Arctic region has faced some of its highest temperatures within the instrumental record. Furthermore, within the past 2000 years, summer temperature highs have never been harsher, based on paleo-climate reconstructions. This warming is due to climate feedback mechanisms based on sea-ice melt. As sea ice melts, it frees up more open ocean water to be further heated, thus bringing about a positive feedback. Ocean water retains more heat than sea ice; additionally the albedo of sea ice is much higher than that of ocean water.
Ringed seals require sea ice to live and reproduce. They live most of their lives alone, only grouping together into colonies when they are on sea ice to molt, mate, or rest. Without access to sea ice, ringed seals are unable to sustain life, which further affects trophic levels both above and below.
Ringed seals are both predators and prey. A predator to zooplankton and fish, the ringed seal is considered a primary consumer as well as a secondary consumer. But the tertiary consumer, or top predator, in the Arctic is the polar bear, feeding mostly on seals, including the ringed seal. Yet through further exploration, the potential fates of this Arctic food web seem to be ambiguous, leading to a very important trade off of polar bear mortality and ringed seal sustenance.

=== Research ===

Most research on ringed seals is focused on their requirement of sea-ice to live and reproduce. With climate change projected to occur most dramatically at the poles, the Arctic is fated to extremely change, mainly with the melting of ice and changes in snowfall. Ferguson et al. studied ringed seal recruitment in western Hudson Bay with a focus on six environmental variables, including: snow depth, snowfall, rainfall, the temperature when pups were born, North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) mechanisms, and lastly the spring break-up. The results of Ferguson et al. determined that decreases in snowfall had a negative effect on ringed seal recruitment, most likely from the occurrence of earlier break up of sea ice. The main process driving this break up is albedo, with less snowfall and more ocean exposed the ice melts more quickly. With seal pups being forced into the water sooner due to lack of ice, recruitment numbers dropped and resulted in a downward trend of the population. Ringed seals are not the only animals that require sea-ice in the Arctic and Sub-Arctic to thrive. Trophic levels come into play in terms of the food web and the reliance of one population on another or many others for survival. Most of this research is actually studied through simulations, since this requires future projections and interactions between many population, physical ocean, and biological mechanisms. Meier et al. studied current and future projections of climate in regards to sea-ice in the Baltic Sea by means of atmosphere-ocean models. Firstly, the ringed seal relies on sea-ice for breeding and is unable to breed on land, meaning, as ice melts away in the future, breeding grounds will become much scarcer. Only one bay, Bothnia Bay in the Baltic Sea, will be able to be used by ringed seals for breeding, vastly limiting their options. Ringed seals are only able to be successful with strained conditions in areas of 90%-100% ice cover probability. (Meier et al. 2004) The changes in ice scarcity projected for the future seem to greatly hinder the ability for ringed seals to reproduce in the Baltic Sea. Hoover et al. looked at multiple marine populations in the Hudson Bay while factoring in both simulated current and higher harvest rates, ultimately determining that ringed seals are identified to increase in population. This is mostly due to the decrease in polar bear populations, the main predator to the ringed seal. Even with a doubling of harvest rates and under the high (A1B) climate scenario, the ringed seals were determined to thrive even more. Hoover et al. further determined that the ringed seal&#x27;s large presence as a circumpolar population along with unspecialized feeding makes the ringed seal less sensitive compared with other Arctic land and marine species. One of the final general conclusions made by Hoover et al. stated that while many current harvested populations will decrease with proposed climate change, ringed seals should be considered for redirecting harvest towards their populations.

In the Hudson Bay, Canada, the body conditions of ringed seals were observed from 2003-2013. Aerial surveys showed a decline in ringed seal density, with the lowest occurrence of seals in 2013. The lower ice coverage means more open water swimming for the ringed seals, which caused higher stress (cortisol) rates. Low ovulation rate, low pregnancy rate, fewer pups in the Inuit harvest, and observations of sick seals was also seen over the course of the study.

=== In context ===

The ringed seal is a very important link in the food chain, separating primary producers from primary predators. Historically the ringed seal was the most abundant of any other seals in the Arctic, yet this species has had its share of population slumps. First there was over-harvesting of the ringed seal, drastically dropping numbers from about 200,000 in 1900 to only 4,000 in the 1970s. Secondly, pollution from organochlorides due to DDT and other residues caused many Arctic marine mammals including the ringed seal to become sterile. Sterility still affects many marine mammals living in the Arctic, being a mechanism of bioaccumulation within the Arctic food web. The ringed seal is not fragile considering their past, yet climate change will have the greatest population effect on the ringed seals thus far due to anthropogenic causes.

=== Future ===

The future of ringed seal populations in the Arctic and Sub Arctic is uncertain, but two main projections surface based around habitat and predators. The first projection focuses on the direct effects of climate change on sea-ice and the limited environment that it will provide the ringed seal with. The majority of past research has been focused around this main idea of quicker melting sea ice leading to lower ringed seal populations from lack of breeding areas. Yet what most research has not also taken into account is the quick drop in polar bear populations. As the main predator of ringed seals, the polar bears extinction in the coming years will allow for ringed seal populations to flourish. In the end, ringed seals are estimated to thrive with no polar bears present in the Arctic and Sub Arctic. Although this predator factor is involved with more recent research, it does not necessarily mean this will be the outcome, considering the uncertainty in such projections. Overall, ringed seals populations will fluctuate regardless of each potential outcome and climate change is certain to affect not only the ringed seal but all Arctic and Sub Arctic animal populations.

<text>Rutherglen is a town in north-eastern Victoria, Australia, near the Murray River border with New South Wales. The town was named after the Scottish town of Rutherglen which lies just outside Glasgow. At the , Rutherglen had a population of 2,579.

==Features==

Rutherglen is located north of Wangaratta and west of Wodonga, just 10 kilometres from the Murray River at the border towns of Wahgunyah and Corowa.

Originally a gold-mining town of the mid-19th century, it has since developed into a major wine-producing area, with 17 wineries all located within a short drive from the town centre.
The main street of Rutherglen maintains its historical charm, with most of the shop fronts retaining the same look they had a century ago. Attractions within the town include Lake King which is surrounded by Apex Park and Rutherglen Park, as well as the historical wine-bottle-shaped water tower in Campbell Street.

==History==

Rutherglen Post Office opened on 1 November 1860. The &quot;Rutherglen Sun and Chiltern Valley Advertiser&quot; newspaper was published between 1886 and 1979.

The Rutherglen Magistrates&#x27; Court closed on 1 January 1990.

==Wine==

The Rutherglen wine region is a wine-producing area around the town of Rutherglen and is particularly noted for its sweet fortified wine styles including Muscat, Topaque (formerly known as Tokay) and Port.

The largest winery in the region is the All Saints Winery, located just a short drive north-west outside of Wahgunyah. Established in 1864, it features landscaped gardens, ponds, a restaurant and wine tasting facilities. The Rutherglen Wine Experience Visitor Information Centre, located in the town centre on Main Street, offers displays of the town&#x27;s rich history, how wines are made, and comprehensive tourist information.

==Sport==
Unusually for a town of its size, Rutherglen has two Australian Rules football teams. The town in conjunction with nearby town Corowa has an Australian Rules football team (Corowa-Rutherglen) competing in the Ovens &amp; Murray Football League. Another Australian rules football team, Rutherglen Football Club, play in the Tallangatta &amp; District Football League.

Golfers play at the course of the Rutherglen Golf Club on Murray Street. The current club professional is Paul Black.

<text>Houston Person (born November 10, 1934) is an American jazz tenor saxophonist and record producer. Although he has performed in the hard bop and swing genres, he is most experienced in and best known for his work in soul jazz. He received the &quot;Eubie Blake Jazz Award&quot; in 1982.

==Biography==

Person grew up in Florence, South Carolina, and first played piano, before switching to tenor saxophone. He studied at South Carolina State College, where he was inducted into the school&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1999.

In the United States Air Force, he joined a service band stationed in West Germany, and played with Don Ellis, Eddie Harris, Cedar Walton, and Leo Wright. Person later continued his studies at Hartt College of Music in Hartford, Connecticut.

He first became known for a series of albums for Prestige in the 1960s. Contrary to popular belief, he was never married to the vocalist Etta Jones, but did spend many years as her musical partner, recording, performing and touring, and for much of his career this association was what he was best known for. They first met playing in organist Johnny Hammond&#x27;s band.

There are more than 75 albums recorded by Person as a bandleader, on Prestige, Westbound, Mercury, Savoy, and Muse, and he has most recently been recording on HighNote. He has recorded with Charles Brown, Ron Carter, Bill Charlap, Charles Earland, Lena Horne, Etta Jones, Lou Rawls, Janis Siegel, Horace Silver, Dakota Staton, Cedar Walton, plus Billy Butler, Don Patterson, Grant Green, Sonny Phillips, Johnny &quot;Hammond&quot; Smith, Richard &quot;Groove&quot; Holmes and others.

Person has been a resident of Newark, New Jersey.

== Awards ==
Person received the Eubie Blake Jazz Award in 1982, and in 2011 the Jazz Legend Award, presented in San Diego.

<text>Rutherglen (; , ) is a town in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, immediately south-east of the city of Glasgow, from its centre and directly south of the River Clyde. Having previously existed as a separate Lanarkshire burgh, in 1975 Rutherglen lost its own local council and administratively became a component of the City of Glasgow District within the Strathclyde region (along with neighbouring Cambuslang). In 1996 the towns were reallocated to the South Lanarkshire council area.
==History==

Rutherglen received the status of Royal Burgh in 1126 by Royal Charter from King David I of Scotland, who reigned from 1124 to 1153. It gradually diminished in importance as neighbouring Glasgow grew in power and size. The masons who built Glasgow Cathedral are thought to have lodged in Rutherglen.
In the 14th century Walter Stewart, father of King Robert II, was granted Farme Castle. This was located close to Farme Cross in the north of Rutherglen, and stood until the 1960s.

Another castle, Rutherglen Castle, was occupied by an English garrison during the struggle between John Balliol and Robert Bruce for the Scottish crown. It was besieged by Robert the Bruce in 1309 and eventually came into Scottish possession in 1313. It was destroyed by Regent Murray after the Battle of Langside.

Rutherglen was a centre of heavy industry, having a long coal mining tradition which died out by 1950. In the 18th century, barges carried coal from Rutherglen to Greenock almost ever day. A small shipyard, T.B. Seath &amp; Co., was in operation on the Clyde at the northern edge of the town for several decades. The Clydebridge Steelworks, situated between Rutherglen and Cambuslang, began operating in the 1880s and employed thousands by the mid-20th century, but the workforce dwindled to a few dozen by the 20th century and now only refines steel produced elsewhere. J &amp; J White Chemicals (later ACC Chrome &amp; Chemicals) in Shawfield, which was in existence from 1820 to 1967, produced more than 70 per cent of the UK&#x27;s chromate products including chromic acid, chromic oxide pigment, sodium and potassium chromate and dichromate. Today there is a significant legacy of soluble chromium (VI) waste in the area.

The town seal&#x27;s 19th-century Latin motto rendered by Professor George Gilbert Ramsay is &quot;Ex fumo fama&quot; (&#x27;fame from smoke&#x27;). A local saying derived from it is &quot;Let Ruglen&#x27;s lums reek briskly&quot;. There is also the deliberately difficult to pronounce alternative &quot;Ru’glen’s wee roond red lums reek briskly&quot;. (These are an adaptation of a Scotticism that correlates a smoking chimney with a prosperous, healthy and long life). All refer to the importance of industry and industriousness to the area.
 

The traditional version of the seal itself contained depictions of the Virgin and Child supported by twin angels (earlier by priests with thistles) and a fishing boat and men in the background. Along with the addition of the motto, in the 1889 official version the boat had a water design added, became more prominent and was placed in a shield at front centre, flanked by the angels with a helmet and mantling above, and the Virgin Mary above that. Over a century later, a simplified version was produced in 1999 featuring only the boat, the motto and a crown to represent the historic Royal Burgh status (which by then no longer had any legal significance); in the early 21st century, this seal often appears on the local Christmas lights. The ship and crown appear on the similar South Lanarkshire coat of arms, with cinquefoil flowers representing Hamilton and a double-headed eagle for Lanark.

Horse and cattle markets, including the regular Beltane Fair in May and St Luke&#x27;s Fair in November (accompanied by the baking of sour cakes by locals) were also common and popular until the 20th century, and are the reason for the Main Street being unusually wide.

Rutherglen is nowadays primarily a dormitory suburb of Glasgow.

===Etymology===
The name of Rutherglen, as well as its Scots name &quot;Ruglen&quot;, is perhaps . The derivation may also however be Welsh, or Cumbric and mean &quot;the valley of Rydderch&quot;. Rydderch – pronounced &#x27;rutherch&#x27; – &#x27;ruther&#x27; as in &#x27;brother&#x27; and &#x27;ch&#x27; as in &#x27;loch&#x27; – was one of the most famous kings associated with the Welsh-speaking kingdom which centred on Dumbarton.

==Governance==
===Westminster===
A separate constituency in the Parliament of Scotland from the late 16th century, 
Rutherglen was a parliamentary burgh represented in the UK Parliament as a component of Glasgow Burghs constituency from 1708 to 1832, and as a component of Kilmarnock Burghs from 1832 to 1918. In 1918, the Rutherglen constituency was created, which became Glasgow Rutherglen in 1983. In 2005, Scottish constituencies for the UK parliament were reviewed with many new seats introduced, and the town fell within the new Rutherglen and Hamilton West constituency. Following another review in 2023, the Rutherglen constituency was revived.

As of October 2023, Michael Shanks of the Scottish Labour Party is the local MP; He won a by-election after the previous incumbent Margaret Ferrier, latterly an independent, was removed in a recall petition. Ferrier won the 2015 and 2019 elections representing the Scottish National Party, with Labour&#x27;s Ged Killen serving a brief term from 2017 to 2019. She was the town&#x27;s first female MP as well as the first for the SNP (the seat had been held by Labour since 1964, with only two men – Gregor Mackenzie and Tommy McAvoy – representing the area between then and 2010, after which Tom Greatrex served one full term). Michael Shanks retained the seat comfortably when the revived Rutherglen constituency was first contested in 2024.

===Holyrood===
In 1999, the Scottish Parliamentary constituency of Glasgow Rutherglen was created, with the same boundaries as the then UK parliamentary constituency. Labour&#x27;s Janis Hughes was the first elected MSP. In 2011, The constituency was redrawn and renamed simply &quot;Rutherglen&quot; (although it also encompasses Cambuslang and Blantyre). Following the 2016 elections, Clare Haughey (SNP) is the MSP for Rutherglen. The defeated incumbent James Kelly (Labour) was elected as a list MSP for the Glasgow region which includes Rutherglen due to the town&#x27;s proximity to the city. Haughey held the seat in the 2021 election with a slightly increased majority.

===South Lanarkshire Council===
Administratively, the historic town centre is within the Rutherglen Central and North ward of South Lanarkshire Council, which has a population of around 15,000. Taking another ward encompassing the southern parts of the town into consideration, its overall population was approximately 30,000 in 2016. With neighbouring Cambuslang&#x27;s figures being very similar, the many services and amenities shared between the towns should provide for 60,000 residents, many assessed as living in economic hardship.

==Transport==
Rutherglen Burgh is served by Rutherglen railway station (opened in 1849), with and stations closer to southern parts of the town. There are also numerous bus links into Glasgow city centre or other destinations such as Hamilton, East Kilbride, Govanhill and Dennistoun, all services either running directly along the Main Street (which has dedicated public transport lanes for peak times) or close to it via Mill Street / Glasgow Road (A730) to the west, Cambuslang Road (A724) to the north or Stonelaw Road / Farmeloan Road (A749) to the east. Glasgow Corporation Tramways operated routes in the area from the early 1900s until the late 1950s.

Completion of the M74 Extension in 2011 meant that there is a six-lane motorway bisecting the northern part of the town, allowing easier access to places such as Glasgow Airport and the English border. Some years after the project was completed, studies show that pollution levels on Rutherglen&#x27;s densely populated Main Street were still measured consistently at dangerously high levels, despite forecasts that traffic levels on urban streets in areas served by the motorway would reduce.

==Media==
The local newspaper is the &quot;Rutherglen Reformer&quot; (owned by Reach plc, with online content presented under the &quot;Daily Record&quot; banner). The local community radio station is CamGlen Radio.

==Geography==

Since being granted Royal Burgh status by King David I in the 12th century, Rutherglen has grown considerably from its origins as little more than a single street, and although growth has been hampered to some extent by the proximity of the river Clyde to the north, the encroaching Glasgow urban sprawl to the west and the boundary with neighbouring Cambuslang to the east, it now covers a much larger area than its ancient parish boundaries. Historic areas near the Main Street such as Bankhead, Burnhill and Gallowflat have changed greatly over the decades, with the Farme Cross and Shawfield areas mostly occupied by industry of various types; the expansion of the village of Burnside (which falls under the Rutherglen boundary but has its own Community Council) to share a single suburban settlement with its larger neighbour, and the construction after World War II of peripheral housing schemes on land surrounding Burnside which had been either farms or rural estates (Blairbeth, Cathkin, Eastfield, Fernhill, Spittal and Springhall) have given the town a frequently changing character.

The 1922 book &quot;Rutherglen Lore&quot; indicated a deliberate intention for the historic Burgh area to be encircled to the south by residential suburbs, while all land to its north would be dedicated to industry, and that largely remains the case a century later. This focus, and the aforementioned territorial limitations, have meant housebuilding has generally been southwards on the higher ground leading to the Cathkin Braes (with almost all suitable land occupied by the early 21st century) and nowadays the town&#x27;s historic core, with the majority of facilities and the highest population density, is concentrated much further north than the geographic centre. Cambuslang has a similar issue: its main street is in the far west of its territory near to the Rutherglen boundary and the river, and eastwards has been the easiest direction of its suburban expansion. 

===Burgh (Main Street) and Clincarthill===

The Burgh area includes the old heart of the around the ancient and unusually wide, tree-lined Main Street and its environs, which have been designated a conservation area since 2008. It features several religious establishments, various pubs, shops and restaurants, historic and modern civic buildings and community facilities, all within a dense network of housing, mainly tenements. In the 2000s, a webcam focused on the everyday activities at the western end of Main Street was recognised as having among the highest number of views in the world at the time for footage of its type, despite there being no obvious reason for this popularity; the webcam is no longer in operation, although later proposals were made by local civic figures to have another installed.

The dominant architectural feature of the Main Street, on its north side, is the imposing Town Hall built in 1862 to a design by Charles Wilson. Having fallen into disrepair and disuse the Category A-listed building was refurbished and extended around 2005 and today is a venue for weddings, theatrical performances and exhibitions, while still providing some local services.
Most of the other most important Rutherglen landmarks are in the immediate vicinity of the Town Hall. To its west is Rutherglen Old Parish Church, the fourth incarnation of the institution (which has had a building on the site since around 600 AD) constructed in 1902 to a J. J. Burnet design. Between the church and the town hall sits the ancient graveyard (13th century), the (16th century) and its Kirk Port stone entrance (17th century). The mediaeval church was said to be the location where William Wallace completed a peace treaty between England and Scotland in 1297, and where John de Menteith subsequently agreed a pact to betray Wallace in 1305, events which are marked by plaques and commemorated annually by Scottish nationalists.

On the corner of Main Street and Queen Street outside the church is a statue of Dr. James Gorman (1832–1899), a well-known local surgeon – this was erected in 1901 by public subscription due to his great standing in the area for his actions, including treating the injured after mining disasters. To the rear of the church is a Masonic Hall dating from 1897 and built to replace older premises on Cathcart Road – the group can trace their origins locally back to the 1760s.
To the immediate east of the Town Hall is the burgh&#x27;s public library constructed in 1907 to an Edwardian design by Sinclair &amp; Ballantine (technically &#x27;Post Office and Library&#x27;, but the dedicated post office closed in 2005, with its replacement inside an existing shop further east along the Main Street). A Carnegie library, its main hall to the rear features a stained-glass dome in the roof and oak paneling in the interior. Its first librarian, who also lived in the upper floor, was William Ross Shearer, author of the 1922 book &quot;Rutherglen Lore&quot; which would come to be considered one of the most important references for the town&#x27;s long history. The building was refurbished in the early 1990s and re-opened once again in 2010 following a further extensive refurbishment which included an expansion into the Post Office section. On the wide pavement outside the library is a replica of the town&#x27;s mercat cross (the original stood nearby from the 12th to the 18th century), erected in 1926 as part of Rutherglen&#x27;s octo-centenary celebrations, and in memory of a former provost of the burgh. It was earlier the site of the old &#x27;Tollbooth and Gaol&#x27; (town hall and prison) which was constructed in the 1760s and demolished in the 1900s.

Behind the library on King Street is the premises of the local branch of The Salvation Army whose brass band play regularly at the Old Parish Church and who have had a presence in the town since the 1880s; their hall stands roughly on the site of the mediaeval Rutherglen Castle, and replaced a wooden building initially used by the Rechabite Society. The local fire brigade (established 1892) was also based nearby, but since 1970 the local station has been at Cambuslang with other stations fairly close at Polmadie and Castlemilk.

Directly across from the Town Hall is , the current main building of which dates from 1940 (designed by Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia), although the congregation was established in 1851 and there has been a documented Catholic presence in the local area since the 6th century. Behind the church are its older halls, previously serving as a school, which was rebuilt internally after a major fire in 2004. To the west of the church, hemmed in by tenements is the 1930s Vogue Cinema, which is the only surviving building of its type in the town, although it was converted to a bingo hall in the 1970s.
Other buildings of note include the spire of Rutherglen East Parish Church at Rutherglen Cross – the junction of Main Street, Farmeloan Road and Stonelaw Road – which was originally built in 1872 for a Reformed Presbyterian congregation, closed in 1981 and was converted into the &#x27;Aspire Business Centre&#x27; in 2003. Its church halls became a facility used by local community organisations. After a new eastern section of Main Street was set out with the removal of old cottages beside the church (this would later be extended through the Gallowflat area), in 1914 a cinema, &#x27;The Pavilion&#x27; was constructed there to a design by John Fairweather; later being refurbished in 1930 as &#x27;Green’s Picturedrome&#x27;, it closed in 1959 although was not demolished until the 1980s. A further small church (Rutherglen Congregational Church) was also built opposite the cinema; in the wake of the congregation moving on to new premises on Johnstone Drive (where they remain to this day), its halls were occupied from the late 1930s by the Rutherglen Repertory Theatre, established by Glaswegian actress Molly Urquhart who set up in the town for no particular reason apart from the venue being available. The halls are now apartments (having been the &#x27;Clyde Club&#x27; until a 1990s fire) and the theatre company have their premises a few blocks south on Hamilton Road, with many of their performances held at the renovated Town Hall.

Behind the East Church on King Street, once the location of one of the local Stonelaw coal mines in the 19th century, is the Rutherglen police station which was built in the mid-1950s; prior to this the local force, established as the Rutherglen Special Constabulary in 1848 (later part of Lanarkshire Constabulary, thereafter Strathclyde Police and today Police Scotland), had their premises and cells in the Tollbooth followed by the new Town Hall. The police station is adjacent to the former district Court and museum and was overlooked to the south by &#x27;Royal Burgh House&#x27;, an office block built in 1998, originally occupied by the local authority which subsequently relocated the services to East Kilbride and Cambuslang before the building was largely destroyed by a fire in 2022.

Further west between King Street and High Street, the ornate Rutherglen Evangelistic Institute was completed in 1887 with input from local businessmen John White (Lord Overtoun) and Daniel Rodger (brother of the local MP Adam Keir Rodger) and played a significant role in supporting local members in military service during World War I, but had fallen out of use and been demolished by the 1940s, with only the later housekeeper&#x27;s residence still remaining and modern apartments occupying the rest of the site; however, the adjacent three-storey Burgh Primary School building (1901) has been retained and was converted to a business centre. Across the street to the north is Glenburgh Nursery Centre, a modern dedicated council childcare facility for the town centre.

In 2010, Burgh Primary moved from their 1901 building to new premises a few blocks east, still in the heart of town on Victoria Street, – this site was previously the location of the Macdonald School: built 1865, used in its later years as an annex for Rutherglen Academy, then as a nursery and community centre, demolished in the 2000s. The new school&#x27;s mini sports pitch was once the site of the Rutherglen United Presbyterian Church from 1836 until the 1910s while on the opposite side of King Street sits the current Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster premises, next to a wynd leading to Main Street which has existed for several centuries.

The &quot;Mitchell Arcade&quot; indoor shopping precinct on the south side of Main Street, built in the early 1970s in place of a block of older tenements on Mitchell Street and Stonelaw Road and a small cinema (the &#x27;Grand Central&#x27;) was given a makeover in 2014 and renamed the &quot;Rutherglen Exchange Shopping Centre&quot;; it has a rooftop car park and used to feature a daily market. A branch of Boots Chemist occupied a corner site both in the older buildings at Rutherglen Cross and when these were replaced, having a presence at the same location in the town for over a century. The land to the east on Stonelaw Road stood unused for several years until the local council housing office (later a business centre) was constructed there in the 1990s, while as of 2020 the land across the road once occupied by the &#x27;Electric Palace Cinema&#x27; (later a billiards hall) has never been built upon.

A short distance to the west of the Arcade, the contemporary &quot;Greenhill Court&quot; housing complex (consisting of three main blocks and two smaller connecting blocks, designed in a &#x27;scissor section&#x27; setup) similarly replaced a street of tenements at Regent Street, as well as the Royal Burgh Bakery, home to Paterson&#x27;s bakers (biscuits and oatcakes) from 1895 until 1971 when the factory became outdated and production moved to Livingston.
At what is now the western end of Main Street (since it was shortened by the construction of the dual carriageway bypass first phase in the early 1970s), there are two public houses on its northern side; the &#x27;Vogue Bar&#x27; has been present for some decades and is known as a base for local Celtic F.C. supporters; the &#x27;Picture House&#x27; is a 2009 expansion of the equally venerable Linn O Dee establishment, taking inspiration for its name from another disappeared cinema, the &#x27;Rio&#x27;, which was demolished in 1971 to make way for the bypass. This extensive work on the road network in this part of the town also caused the destruction of the town&#x27;s medical clinic (services were relocated to a new Health Centre on Stonelaw Road) and many other older residential and commercial buildings, and physically disconnected the war memorial and a church from the heart of the burgh (see Burnhill). Most of the pubs in Rutherglen are on the north side of the Main Street and to its west, a legacy of the Temperance (Scotland) Act 1913 when the south side of the street and other parts were declared &#x27;dry areas&#x27; following local referendums on the issue. The Act was repealed in the 1970s, but it still drew comment in local media in 2012 when a textiles shop (previously the local co-operative society&#x27;s headquarters) on the south side of Main Street opposite the Vogue and Picture House was to be converted into a new Wetherspoons pub (&#x27;An Ruadh-Ghleann&#x27;, taking its name from the Gaelic version of Rutherglen).

There is a high concentration of licensed premises in the vicinity, several with a continuous presence on the same spot since the mid-19th century and others which have been forced to relocate but carry the traditions of earlier versions including the three aforementioned hostelries on Main Street plus &#x27;The Sportsman&#x27; on Glasgow Road, &#x27;The Millcroft&#x27; and &#x27;Wallace Bar&#x27; on the old section of Mill Street and the &#x27;Cathkin Inn&#x27; two blocks further south, &#x27;Harleys Sky Bar&#x27;, &#x27;Gormans&#x27; and &#x27;The Burgh Bar&#x27; around Queen Street, &#x27;Chapmans&#x27; at Rutherglen Cross and the &#x27;Victoria Bar&#x27; a short distance further north, plus three dedicated off-sales and additional licensed grocers, and several other premises which were converted from bars to other uses in the early-21st century. As well as the clustering of pubs being explained by historic licensing arrangements, the proximity of Hampden Park and Celtic Park football stadiums also brings some occasional additional custom to the area, which to some extent also accounts for a high number of bookmakers around the Main Street.

While redevelopment saw many of central Rutherglen&#x27;s older tenements swept away, many of the others also fell into disrepair until work to maintain them was carried out by Rutherglen Housing Action Group, established in 1979. This later became the Rutherglen and Cambuslang Housing Association, based at the Aspire Centre and managing hundreds of properties in the area, although some like Greenhill Court are still managed directly by the local authority. Despite new projects being undertaken regularly by the organisation in the limited space available in the area, the shortage of homes available for rent became a major issue locally going into the 21st century.
The town&#x27;s current railway station opened in 1979 is the fourth such provision in the immediate area, with the first (1842–1879 and second (1879–1897) - on what are now the West Coast Main Line tracks which no longer offer a stop in Rutherglen - accessed from either side of Farmeloan Road. The third version (1892–1979) was further west and accessed off Queen Street; it was soon extended in 1896 to include the Glasgow Central Railway line (which is now the Argyle Line served by the current station) which increased the total number of platforms on various lines to twelve, but this gradually reduced until 1964 when the Beeching cuts resulted in the Glasgow Central extension closing, with only two at Queen Street remaining. On the opening of the Argyle Line and new station in 1979 the old station was abandoned, although its crumbling platforms are still visible and its entrance stairway and walkway is linked to its replacement.

Located on an island platform and now directly under the elevated M74 motorway, the current station is connected to the Burgh streets via a covered pedestrian overbridge, the main entrance to which on Victoria Street was decorated with murals themed on the history of the town in 2018. Beside this mural to the west is Reuther Hall, a community centre used by a retired ladies group among others, while to the east is the building previously used as the town Employment Exchange - it has been converted into business use, as has the Youth Employment Exchange on King Street, while the local JobCentre service is now based further south at Greenhill Road.

====Clincarthill====
Lying immediately to the south of the Burgh area between Greenhill Road and Johnstone Drive, Clincarthill rises high over the Main Street offering fine northern views. The area has a distinctive character of its own, with plenty of remaining old sandstone tenements, villas and terraced houses from the late 19th and early 20th century, some on the incline accessible only via footpaths. A pedestrian overbridge across the busy Mill Street dual carriageway links Clincarthill with the Bankhead neighbourhood to its west. There are several places of worship in the area: Minhaj-ul-Quran mosque (previously a Scout hall), Rutherglen Baptist Church (established 1889, built 1903) and Rutherglen United Free Church (established 1902, built 1935), while the town&#x27;s JobCentre is built on the site of another (Greenhill Church). Adjacent to this is a vacant plot which was the location of Rutherglen Swimming Pool from 1967 until the 2005 but has lain empty since.

There is also a Catholic primary school (St Columbkille&#x27;s) in Clincarthill, built on the site of Bellevue House, a children&#x27;s home run by the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul from 1912 to 1961 which was discredited in the 2018 Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry.

Rutherglen Primary Care Centre, the town&#x27;s public health facility, is located on flatter land south of Clincarthill backing on to Overtoun Park (where another hill forms to the west) and built around 1999 to replace the Rutherglen Health Centre, which it itself had replaced the old clinic on Main Street that was bulldozed to allow construction of the Mill Street bypass road. Rutherglen Maternity Hospital stood adjacent from 1978 to 1998, but despite a good record of patient care and only 20 years in operation, it was closed and demolished to alleviate financial burdens in the local health board and concentrate a wider range of services over fewer sites. With the hospital constructed on reclaimed park land that had been an excavated part of a mine before being filled in, there was also concern that chromium contamination was present in the ground. The immediate area also features a number of old buildings, including a square block of red sandstone tenements and some grand villas.

===Farme Cross===
Farme Cross is one of the boundary areas of Rutherglen and is surrounded to the north by the River Clyde with Glasgow&#x27;s Dalmarnock district on the opposite bank, the two sides being linked by iron road and rail bridges dating from the 1890s, while it is separated from the old Burgh area uphill to the south by 19th century railway tracks and a 21st century motorway. It originated as the Farme estate crown property which was passed through noble families for centuries. Centred around the Farme Castle, it became known for coal mining from the early 19th century under the control of estate owner James Farie, with other industries soon following. The roads through the territory (A724 and A749) meet to join two busy routes between eastern Glasgow to the north, Rutherglen to the south and Cambuslang (via Eastfield) to the east. It was served by Glasgow&#x27;s tram network providing transport for the workforces, a role still performed by buses.

There are several historic buildings and pieces of street art here, including a set of four carved standing stones (&#x27;Boundary Stones&#x27; by Richard Brown, 2001) installed in an area of open ground to commemorate the history of the Royal Burgh and its original boundary stones, some of which (dating back to the 18th and 19th century) are themselves still in situ, mostly at Farme Cross and in the southern parts of the town. Another monument (&#x27;Slipsteam&#x27; by Joseph Ingleby, 2001) alongside the river near Dalmarnock Bridge involves metallic cogged mouldings (featuring designs by local schoolchildren) placed on brick walls and emerging in loops from the ground, and recalls local industry on the Clyde and the contours of the river itself.
Businesses at Farme Cross were once many and varied, with the energy to operate them supplied by a large power station just over the river, where the nearby Dalmarnock, Bridgeton and Parkhead districts also developed a similar strong industrial profile The industries included:
*the &quot;Farme Castle Colliery&quot; with two pits, associated row cottages and branch railway – its Newcomen atmospheric engine is on display at Summerlee Industrial Heritage Museum (Coatbridge)
*the &quot;Caledonian Pottery&quot; which was latterly operated by Hartley&#x27;s Jams and was later the site of a small steel works; lying in the path of the new motorway construction, it was first subject to an excavation which uncovered the foundations of the original buildings for examination
*&quot;Scotia Bolt Works&quot;
*three dyeing works (&quot;Clyde Bank Works&quot;; &quot;David Millar &amp; Co / Clydesdale Dye Works&quot;; &quot;Eastfield Dye Works&quot; which later became the &quot;Eastfield Chair Works&quot;)
*three tube/pipe works (&quot;Unicode&quot;; &quot;James Menzies and Co / Phoenix Tubeworks&quot;; and the adjacent &quot;James Eadie and Sons / Clydesdale Tube Works&quot;, both acquired by Stewarts &amp; Lloyds)
*three wire rope works (&quot;John Todd &amp; Son / Rutherglen Ropes&quot;; &quot;John Wilson &amp; Son / Eastfield Ropery&quot;; and &quot;Clyde Patent Rope Works / Allan, Whyte and Co&quot;, acquired by British Ropes) the latter of which had a distinctive sandstone office with turret situated on the cross, demolished in the 1990s after falling into disrepair
*two paper mills (&quot;Eastfield Paper Mill&quot; near the river and the &#x27;Old Farme&#x27; steading which has survived to the 21st century, and the larger &quot;Clyde Paper Mill&quot; off Cambuslang Road),
*&quot;Adam&#x27;s Brickworks&quot;
*the &quot;Monogram&quot; bedding factory (previously used by the &quot;EKCO&quot; radio equipment company)

By the 1970s, the vast majority of these industries had either severely contracted or in most cases closed altogether, causing severe employment difficulties for the area. The low-lying area was severely impacted by a flood in 1994, as had occurred previously in 1903, resulting in improved prevention measures being introduced. One of the firms which endured into the 21st century, &quot;Sanmex Chemicals&quot;, eventually left town in the 2010s after a merger with an Ayrshire-based rival. Another, the bottling and distribution arm of &quot;The Speyside distillery&quot;, had closed a few years earlier. Both sites were soon advertised as new investment opportunities.

A Tesco superstore built in the early 21st century on some of the vacant former industrial land between the river and railway lines off Dalmarnock Road (specifically the Phoenix Tubeworks, which had been converted into a trading estate) was later extended to feature two fast-food restaurants. A small light industry development borders the superstore, and this mirrors the changes throughout Farme Cross, with the bustling but dirty factories of the past gradually being replaced by small workshops, business units and modern warehouses and depots, though in some cases with an intervening period of several years as derelict buildings, then cleared brownfield land awaiting development. Regeneration projects (controlled by the Clyde Gateway organisation) accelerated following the completion of the M74 Extension to the Glasgow Region Motorway network in 2011, with Junction 2 directly serving Farme Cross. This led to more ambitious plans being adopted for the area (as well as at Shawfield), including the &quot;Rutherglen Links&quot; environmentally friendly business park, the main building for which occupies a prominent location off Farmeloan Road, with further office pavilions further east towards the motorway junction.

Various further commercial proposals have been put forward for the eastern part of this area, with disused depots levelled and a driving range under construction between 2020 and 2022.

Despite its identity being dominated by heavy industry, there has always been a residential aspect to Farme Cross. The oldest surviving examples are the Terrace cottages, a cluster of four small streets built for local workers by the Glasgow Working Men&#x27;s Investment and Building Society in the 1880s, the only co-operative housing of this kind in the town and built at angles off the main road, designated as a conservation area in the 1980s. Unusually, the two-storey buildings feature main doors at the front and the back to access flats on different levels - a similar design can be seen in the Colony houses at several locations in Edinburgh. Traditional tenements which once stood right on the cross in front of the terraces and opposite on Farmeloan Road were demolished in the mid-20th century, but some slightly newer sandstone tenements remain on the north side of Cambuslang Road and Dalmarnock Road, including a Category C-listed corner block which houses the area&#x27;s sole public house at ground level (known as &#x27;Tennents&#x27; for decades, with a small number of resident clientele, the business suffered as the passing trade from factory workers dwindled, changing hands several times in the early 21st century). The area facing this block, where British Ropes once had their turreted offices, was developed as the Lloyd Court apartment complex in the 2000s, the design of which resembles older styles. A small inter-war development of cottage flats around Montraive Street and grey concrete tenements at Barnflat Street and Baronald Street received new neighbours in the early 2000s with the building of around 100 houses at Farme Castle Court (this is actually slightly east of the actual location of Farme Castle).

Rutherglen&#x27;s Kingdom Hall (established in 1958, rebuilt in 2012) is located in Farme Cross on Baronald Street. Across the street is a playground and a small local community hall. The Farme Bowling Club on Cambuslang Road, which was linked to the nearby Clyde Paper Mill, closed its doors in 2006.

The Cuningar Loop is an area of land south of the River Clyde near Farme Cross. An isolated meander of the river which was once a Glasgow sewage treatment facility, then infilled with rubble from the city&#x27;s slum clearance programme before being abandoned to become overgrown, it has now been transformed into a woodland park connecting across the Clyde to the City of Glasgow (Dalmarnock) and the Commonwealth Games village development via a new footbridge.

===Shawfield===
The Shawfield district, the mostly northerly in the town and once a country estate before being converted into a chemicals facility by the White family, is still industrial in nature, but much of it abandoned in the early 21st century due to the collapse of heavy industry generally, and contamination from the Whites Chemical Works in particular. The Clyde Gateway projects aim to reinvest in this area and create new business parks and make the River Clyde accessible in Rutherglen again – the town&#x27;s old port, once home of Thomas Seath shipbuilders which specialised in Clutha ferries and paddle steamers, is located here. Currently Shawfield Stadium (the former home of Clyde F.C.) hosts greyhound racing; although not immediately noticeable, the building has Art Deco features.

Rutherglen Bridge at Shawfield is the oldest crossing between Rutherglen and Glasgow – specifically the Bridgeton district of the city which was named after the bridge when its construction accelerated industrial growth and trade in the previously agricultural area. Far more recently, a &#x27;smartbridge&#x27; for pedestrians and cyclists was built to encourage links between the regenerating Shawfield area and Dalmarnock railway station, also in connection with the 2014 Commonwealth Games, several of the events for which were held nearby at the Emirates Arena.

===Wardlawhill, Gallowflat and Stonelaw===
====Wardlawhill====

Lying across Stonelaw Road east of Clincarthill, the Wardlawhill area includes some older large houses and tenement buildings; a BBC Scotland report found that Wardlaw Drive, the hill&#x27;s northern slope lined with tenements, ranked seventh among the steepest streets in Scotland. Adjacent to this street, placed at the top of stairs off Hamilton Road and partly built into the hill itself, is the Sri Sundara Ganapathy Hindu Temple (built 1882), previously Wardlawhill Parish Church – the congregation of which merged with the West Parish at Burnhill in 2007, the building being sold in 2010. The church halls across the road are still used by local youth groups such as the Boys Brigade.

To the south, on the other side of the hill is the Rutherglen Academy building on Melrose Avenue (built 1886) which later became Stonelaw High School and was converted into apartments in 2001. Opposite the Academy is a small early 20th century apexed building, originally St Stephen&#x27;s Episcopal Church, nowadays used as a Masonic Lodge since 1971, after the group&#x27;s previous premises on Cathcart Street (dating from 1875, latterly also used by the neighbouring Toryglen chapter) were demolished for the Mill Street bypass project. The house system of Stonelaw High School used to be named from avenues in the area (Jedburgh, Dryburgh, Melrose and Kelso, taken from the Scottish Borders); however, at the start of the 2018 school year this theme changed to Scottish Islands: Arran, Bute and Skye.

====Gallowflat====

The Gallowflat area, known locally as East Main Street, features some 1920s cottage flats and tenement buildings, dating from the construction of an extension to the Main Street – although it may appear natural for the route to continue eastwards as it does today, historically Main Street (and King Street) terminated at Farmeloan Road until the project linking it to Cambuslang Road and removing traffic from Hamilton Road through Wardlawhill. A prominent landmark is a tree-covered ancient burial mound which had been used at one time as an icehouse in the grounds of the grand Gallowflat House (built 1760s, demolished 1910s) which was located at the eastern end of today&#x27;s Reid Street.

Gallowflat Public School (built 1908), later the annexe of Stonelaw High School from 1970 to 1998, was also in the area on Hamilton Road with most of its campus now largely replaced by housing and an elderly persons&#x27; care home aside from one red sandstone block on McCallum Avenue which was converted to apartments in the 2020s. During the 28 years when the Academy and Gallowflat buildings were part of the same school, hundreds of teenage pupils would walk the between them several times each day via the very steep Wardlaw Drive and other quiet residential streets.

====Stonelaw====

Stonelaw is the area south of Gallowflat and Wardlawhill and east of the Primary Care Centre, features of which include Rutherglen Bowling Club – having migrated south from its first (1868) site on Greenhill Road in 1902, the organisation then sold the adjoining land for construction of a church in 1907. The imposing red sandstone building which resulted is now known as Stonelaw Parish Church, though it too was built for a congregation relocating from the old part of town, in this case from their premises on King Street built in the 1830s. It was completed in 1912 – a refurbishment over a century later revealed a time capsule dating from the time of construction. A further modernisation in 2019 included modification of the main hall&#x27;s pews, designed to accommodate far more parishioners than recent attendances, into a more flexible system.

There are two other bowling clubs in the vicinity, also dating from the 1900/10s when that part of the town was being developed: Overtoun Park Bowling Club to the west and Templeton Bowling Club to the east – originally part of the recreation grounds for the James Templeton &amp; Co textile company which had its main premises on Glasgow Green, the club long outlasted its parent firm and the rest of the grounds are nowadays Stonelaw High School&#x27;s playing fields.

A mansion house, Eastpark, stood next door to Templeton&#x27;s (accessed from Buchanan Drive); it was converted to use a nursing home and has continued as part of the Abbeyfield care group, although the expansion and modernisation of the business led to the demolition of the old house, with only its conical sandstone gateposts remaining. Also at Buchanan Drive and on the east side of Stonelaw Road approaching Burnside is Woodburn Park, a valley-like wooded green space, previously a quarry. It takes its name from the adjacent Woodburn House which was home to the horticulture department of Langside College for over 60 years before being sold, demolished and replaced by houses and apartments in the 2010s.

This neighbourhood has many features of the garden suburb, and is perhaps the most up-market place in Rutherglen, being home to many expensive properties. A development of distinctive quartered villas on Rosslyn Avenue / Dryburgh Avenue date from the 1910s, a few years after the houses at Wardlawhill and Clincarthill were completed as Rutherglen began to expand southwards.

The new (1998) site of Stonelaw High School and its sports facilities off Calderwood Road are on the peripheries of the Stonelaw and Burnside areas and also close to Eastfield. Another local school, Calderwood Primary on Buchanan Drive, is sometimes labelled as being located in the Burnside neighbourhood, although its catchment areas are mainly Stonelaw, Eastfield, Gallowflat and the residential streets around Richmond Drive (mostly bungalows built in the 1930s) that, like the schools, do not fall under any single recognised neighbourhood.

===Eastfield===
A former mining community and country estate located off the main road between Rutherglen and Cambuslang, the area was developed for housing in the 1950s. Trinity High School (built in 1970, re-built in 2010) and its sports facilities including public swimming pool are located in Eastfield, which also has two public houses, both off Dukes Road.

To the north of Eastfield and east of Farme Cross is the Clydebridge Steelworks, nowadays operating to a far lower capacity and with a fraction of workers than at its peak points in the mid-20th century when over 3,000 were employed there. Located within a meander of the River Clyde, it was largely inaccessible to civilians until 2011 when the M74 motorway extension was constructed through the middle of its extensive territory. In 2020, the corporation which owned the works announced development plans for the grounds, beginning with a hotel.

===Burnhill, Newfield and Bankhead===
====Burnhill====
Burnhill, in the north-west of Rutherglen, directly borders the Glasgow district of Toryglen to its west (along with woodland at the Malls Mire) and the M74 motorway and West Coast Main Line railway tracks to the north, while its eastern side is close to the Main Street but separated from it by a busy dual carriageway bypass road (part of the A730), built in the early 1970s.
Historically a small network of streets leading west from the Main Street area, becoming increasingly rural in character (Glasgow then expanded in several stages to occupy the countryside between its southern districts and Rutherglen) the construction of the bypass caused the destruction of the area&#x27;s older buildings at Burnhill Street, Chapel Street, Mill Street and Glasgow Road and also physically isolated one of the town&#x27;s main landmarks: the Munro United Free Church, whose Category B listed building dates from 1850. Established in 1836, its congregation merged with that of the original West Parish Church when their building nearby (located on Chapel Street, explaining its name) was demolished to build the road and new housing, and in turn this later became West &amp; Wardlawhill Parish following union with another congregation at the other end of town, both having experienced dwindling membership. Rutherglen&#x27;s war memorial – erected in 1924, designed by Paul Gray with a bronze figure by sculptor George Henry Paulin which originally had a prominent location at the western end of the Main Street – was also left on the &#x27;other&#x27; side of the road. The two parts of town are now connected via pedestrian underpasses which are prone to antisocial behaviour and occasional flooding.
Deemed to be an area generally suffering from high levels of deprivation and associated issues, the &#x27;Burnhill Action Group&#x27; based at the West Church is a community-led volunteer group working to improve the locality&#x27;s environmental conditions, recreational opportunities and facilities. The neighbourhood is recognisable for its &#x27;White Flats&#x27; housing scheme (two dozen separate 16-apartment blocks, cube-shaped but with sloping roofs, dating from the early 1970s and refurbished externally in 2019 at a cost of £1.6 million) that replaced a development of prefabs. There is also older (c. 1930) housing off Toryglen Road and Westmuir Place, and grass areas also feature heavily, especially around the mound of Burnhill itself where the Jenny Burn, flowing from Cathkin Braes via Spittal and Bankhead, passes underneath making its way towards the Clyde. An enclosed area of communal ground behind the houses on Pinkerton Avenue known as the Highbacks, previously neglected until the 2010s, has been adopted and improved by residents as a community events space and garden. The White Flats development had a standalone pub at its centre, briefly known as the &#x27;Burnhill Bar&#x27; but for most of its history named &#x27;The Fairways&#x27; which took its name from the fact that the nearby land was once the open fields of Toryglen Golf Club (as well as Blackfaulds Farm) prior to residential use; it replaced a far older hostelry in the area, &#x27;Ye Olde Inn&#x27;, which had been demolished. The Fairways itself closed in the 2020s following the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Burnhill is home to the local branch of the South Lanarkshire Council youth club Universal Connections, and also the &quot;Celsius Stadium&quot;, home to Rutherglen Glencairn F.C.; completed in 2008, it replaced the club&#x27;s 110-year-old Southcroft Park on the other side of the railway at Shawfield which had been subject to a compulsory purchase order for construction of the M74, although there was sufficient space to build a new social club for the &quot;Glens&quot; beside the motorway at the original location. The earlier Burnhill Sports Centre, next to the new football ground, was closed and demolished in 2017, although the adjacent municipal football pitches remain in use, and in 2023 Glencairn submitted a planning application for a larger clubhouse facility in this area.

====Newfield====
Lying directly south of Burnhill, Newfield is a neighbourhood also adjoining Bankhead (Rutherglen) and Toryglen and King&#x27;s Park (Glasgow) – the boundary with the city is difficult to observe from ground level as it involves houses backing onto one another right up to the border in most places; however, as it is a major administrative divide it is clearly marked on maps, with the street names also changing, e.g. Newfield Place becomes Ardnahoe Avenue. There are limited amenities including a pub, and small grassed areas are dotted around between the housing.

The burn flowing through the area provided power to industries in times past, mostly on Cathcart Road, including the Avonbank, Westburn and Burnside weaving factories, the Cathkin Laundry (1894 to 2013), previously the site of a curling pond opened in 1881 (probably linked to the Carmunnock &amp; Rutherglen Curling Club which still competes today, though not locally based) plant nurseries including Glenroyal – now a small social housing development – and the Cathkin Bakery, the production facility for Nairn&#x27;s (oatcakes and biscuits) until 1978. There was a Newfield House and sawmill, although the largest mansion in the area in times past was Muirbank House – this is long gone, but a pair of cottages from the same era survive almost hidden in woodland amidst far newer housing.

Falling within the Newfield and Bankhead areas is Westhouse, a small 2000s residential estate. It was built in parts of a former quarry, recalled in the names of the nearby street Quarryknowe and in the &#x27;Old Quarry Bar&#x27; on Cathcart Road, although the pub – favoured by Rangers F.C. supporters and themed on the club – is located further east towards Main Street. Located on the ground floor of one of the few tenement buildings to survive the redevelopment of this sector of the town, the Quarry Bar is also close to the local Orange Hall, the &quot;20 District Club&quot;. The rest of the quarry itself is now occupied by a trading estate, tenants including a non-profit community-focused bicycle repair and retail business.

Nearby is the site of Farie Street School (built 1875), latterly re-titled as St Columbkille&#x27;s RC Primary from 1957 until its new buildings opened in Clincarthill in 1969; the Farie Street building was demolished in 1971 with the Mill Court housing estate soon built in its place. One block further south at Harriet Street (on a cleared site previously occupied by a timber merchant), plans were submitted in 2024 for the construction of a &#x27;village&#x27; of modular accommodation for homeless people.

====Bankhead and Quigleys====
Bankhead is a neighbourhood located south-west of central Rutherglen, with its housing visibly of various ages owing to the burgh&#x27;s expansion in stages during the 20th century. South of Newfield and directly bordering the Glasgow district of King&#x27;s Park, much of its street grid shares the same design of 1930s grey pebble-dashed cottage flats. In addition to an eponymous primary school on Bankhead Road, there is a small row of shops on Wallace Street beside the Mill Street overbridge leading to Clincarthill, and more on Curtis Avenue approaching Toryglen including the &quot;100 Acres&quot; pub – an adaptation of &#x27;Hundred Acre Hill&#x27;, the historic name of the high ground overlooking the area to the west. A further selection of convenience stores is located on Castlemilk Road in the south-west of the area, adjoining King&#x27;s Park and some of its amenities including its main church. These are known locally as the &#x27;State shops&#x27; after the State Cinema, later a bingo venue, which was sited there near to King&#x27;s Park Avenue, a prominent local landmark from the 1930s until its demolition in the early 21st century. There was previously also a small public library which closed in 2010 (although named King&#x27;s Park Library, it was on the east side of the road and thus administered by South Lanarkshire Council from 1996).

One surviving feature of Bankhead&#x27;s rural past is the premises of Mitchell&#x27;s Farm (earlier known as Crosshill Farm) dating back to at least the mid-19th century, although its fields on a steep slope were converted into the Cityford housing development around 1990. The Bankhead coal mine was a short distance south-west of the farm. The southern end of Bankhead Road terminates at another cluster of small shops and Croftfoot railway station, with a pedestrian footpath leading to the Croftfoot neighbourhood of Glasgow, and the Spittal neighbourhood of Rutherglen. There is another footpath further west at Castlemilk Road, but vehicles cannot use these routes, instead having to travel around Spittal, a detour of from Bankhead Road at Croftfoot Station, or via Menock Road, a detour of from Castlemilk Road at King&#x27;s Park Avenue, to reach the same point on the other side of the tracks.

Once a private estate based around Bankhead House (owned by several generations of the Quigley family, many of whom were doctors), the land between Bankhead and Mill Street at Overtoun Park became a small housing estate in the early 1970s. The town&#x27;s once-important corn mill from which the road name derives was located a short way east of Bankhead House, close to the Quigleys Community Hall of today – a fact commemorated nearby in a plaque placed on the old stone wall of the estate, also noting the completion of the upgrading of that section of the road in 1993 (Average Speed traffic cameras were installed there in 2018 to combat dangerous driving). The mill was powered from the Cityford Burn that flows through most of this side of Rutherglen and is visible here for some distance, running north then west to a small pond at Bankhead Road, known as the &#x27;Paddy&#x27; (paddling pool), although this is somewhat overgrown and distended and is no longer popular with locals for this recreational purpose as it once was. Flooding in the area in 2004 resulted in extensive remediation works to prevent a repeat.

The King&#x27;s Park Hotel is located to the south of the neighbourhood off Mill Street, while Rutherglen Cemetery&#x27;s main vehicle entrance, lodge house and Cross of Sacrifice is a short distance further south past the junction of King&#x27;s Park Avenue (B762), a 1920s wide boulevard which runs westwards parallel to the railway tracks for into the heart of southern Glasgow at Mount Florida / Battlefield.

===Overtoun Park===
Rutherglen&#x27;s main public park is close to the geographical centre of the town. Laid out on land donated to the Burgh in 1904 by Lord Overtoun, (whose White&#x27;s Chemical Works also ruined much of the area by reckless dumping of their toxic byproduct). it was once the location of the annual &quot;Landemer Day&quot; fair and parade, now confined to the Main Street.

The Category B listed fountain in the park was originally located on Main Street: it had been erected in 1897 to mark Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee but was moved to the park in 1911. The bandstand (1914, also Category B listed) was sited at the west side of the park until it was removed to be used at the 1988 Glasgow Garden Festival. It was re-sited on a grass area in the centre of the park, but later fell into some disrepair due to a lack of maintenance.

The park&#x27;s children&#x27;s play area was extended in the 2010s, and the park&#x27;s BMX tracks have been maintained, but football pitches were built upon and the tennis courts were turfed over; in 2020, proposals were made by Rutherglen Tennis Club to install covered courts at the same location, which would involve a portion of the land being transferred to a private company.

Environmental charity &quot;Grow73&quot; have their base beside Overtoun Park Bowling Club, and a &quot;Friends of Overtoun Park&quot; is also active.

===Burnside, High Crosshill and High Burnside===
Burnside is a village within the Rutherglen boundaries which expanded into a leafy commuter suburb. It is surrounded by several mid-20th century housing estates, in some cases modernised which are within Rutherglen but not considered to be parts of Burnside as they were built to provide homes for people from other areas of the town, and from Cambuslang, who needed to be re-housed. In contrast to affluent Burnside, parts of these estates are considered to be troubled by poverty and related issues, as asserted by several versions of the Scottish index of multiple deprivation.

Centred mostly around Stonelaw Road, Burnside has its own set of shops, church, railway station and primary school. It is also home to a supermarket (once the site of a cinema) and hotel with a popular bar (East Kilbride Road). There is also a bowling green, and two sets of tennis courts (previously separate clubs, they are both now operated by Rutherglen LTC). Much of the traditional residential property was built in the early 1900s from blond and red sandstone.

The local park, Stonelaw Woods, lies at the northern boundary of the village and takes its name from the demolished Stonelaw Tower (a castellated converted 18th-century coal mine winding engine house) that once stood to the east of Stonelaw Road near Greystone Avenue.

High Crosshill is a quiet residential area of wide avenues built on a steep hill between Burnside and Overtoun Park, which has some views on Broomieknowe Road and includes Rutherglen Cemetery. High Burnside is also a residential area, consisting of high ground to the south of Burnside leading to Cathkin Braes with streets of older houses built in several eras. Some of its properties, particularly some of the oldest off Burnside Road, are very large.

===Spittal===

Spittal is a post-World War II community which is almost an exclave of the town, bordering the Glasgow areas of Croftfoot to the west and Castlemilk to the south with an area of open ground to the east; it is close to the King&#x27;s Park Avenue / Bankhead neighbourhood within Rutherglen to the north, but disconnected from it by the Cathcart Circle Lines railway tracks. Built on a mound used as farmland (the farmhouse was located at the junction of Carrick Road and Bute Terrace), the estate was constructed in an oval pattern of streets – named after places in or close to Ayrshire – with its primary school built at the highest point at the centre (completed in 1955). A development of prefabs on the flatter land to the west were replaced by angular blocks of flats in the early 1970s (as also occurred at other locations including Burnhill, Bankhead and at North Halfway in nearby Cambuslang). A new community centre was built in the early 21st century, close to the older small wooden church. There are also local amenities such as shops – including Post Office – on Kyle Square and a pub-restaurant, &#x27;The Croft&#x27;, situated exactly on the local authority boundary at Croftfoot.

Two small burns run on either side of Spittal&#x27;s housing, bordered by grassed areas – one burn runs from Castlemilk Park and the other from further east via High Burnside, both originating on the north slopes of the Cathkin Braes; these waters converge north of Spittal, flowing north to Bankhead and on to Shawfield and the Clyde where it is marked as the Cityford Burn, but colloquially known as the Jenny Burn.

In 2016, the area&#x27;s recreation fields bordering Croftfoot, which had been bequeathed to the community &#x27;in perpetuity&#x27; in the 1930s but had been allowed to fall into disrepair over a number of years, were subject to planning applications for new housing. The &quot;Croftfield Park&quot; development was completed about three years later. A replacement modern AstroTurf football field was added adjacent to the primary school in 2019, although this was several years after the original fields were abandoned and six years after the school itself was replaced (built on its original red blaes pitch), as the old buildings became the temporary home for Bankhead, St Mark&#x27;s and Burnside Primaries while their facilities were also renewed. Just south of Spittal is Kirkriggs School, a Special educational needs facility which is under Glasgow City Council control.

===Blairbeth and Fernhill===
====Blairbeth====

Blairbeth is a small 1950s local authority housing scheme of tenements and modest terraced houses, generally still with the same appearance as at the time of its construction. It was built around a former rural estate (the house, sited at the top of Kirkriggs Avenue, is long since demolished, as was the entrance lodge house to its north). The neighbourhood has some limited local amenities and small parks, as well as a school, St Mark&#x27;s RC Primary – its associated church of the same name is located to the south of the housing at the edge of the neighbouring Fernhill area, which has no direct link to Blairbeth for vehicles. The designated non-denominational school for the locality is Spittal Primary, although some children attend Burnside Primary which is equally close.

Also bordering High Crosshill and High Burnside, many of the hillside streets have views over Rutherglen and Glasgow. A large flat grass field to the west of the neighbourhood was popular in the summer months for informal sports, but its size was greatly reduced by a junction re-alignment in 2016, connecting Croftfoot Road and Blairbeth Road - previously a staggered junction via Fernhill Road with single lanes causing considerable congestion at peak times - into a single crossroads with filter lanes, as part of the Cathkin Relief Road works. To the west of this road is the boundary with the city of Glasgow, denoted visually by the twin castellated stone gates of &#x27;Buchanan Lodge&#x27;, today a nursing home but historically the north-east entrance to the driveway leading to Castlemilk House; the mansion no longer exists, although most of the route through its lands (most of which are occupied by the various neighbourhoods of Castlemilk housing estate) is still present as tree-lined footpaths, managed under an award-winning conservation project. A section of the estate&#x27;s old boundary wall is also visible near Blairbeth, although crumbling and dangerous in parts.

====Fernhill====
Fernhill is a housing estate originally built in the 1960s, which underwent a great deal of regeneration in the 2010s. It is home to an all-girls private school, the main building for which is the historic Fernhill mansion house. The area is bordered by the Castlemilk housing estate in Glasgow to the west, as well as by Blairbeth, High Burnside and Cathkin within Rutherglen. Fernhill Road bisects the estate and is where the rebuilt local amenities (convenience stores, community centre children&#x27;s play area, 5-a-side football fields) are found. The estate also has two churches at either end and a decorative brick entrance wall off Burnside Road.

The Cathkin Relief Road was completed in 2017 at a cost of £21 million to extend Mill Street from Spittal through the informal parkland between Fernhill and Blairbeth/High Burnside to connect with the existing Cathkin Bypass (A730) and alleviate traffic from other local routes including Fernhill Road. In 2019, Fernbrae Meadows was opened to the south of Fernhill; formerly Blairbeth Golf Course, the area is a 20 hectares of semi-natural, managed greenspace.

===Springhall and Cathkin===
====Springhall====

Springhall is a self-contained 1960s local authority housing estate, mostly consisting of a compact network of maisonettes, and featuring a community centre and library dating back to the time of the scheme&#x27;s construction but extensively upgraded between 2019 and 2021. Below the original library is a small set of local shops. There is also a catholic church and two local schools, St Anthony&#x27;s RC Primary and Loch Primary, both rebuilt in the 2000s in a mirror image of one another and now share a playground. The schools&#x27; playing fields are located on the site of a former loch (Boultrie Loch) which was popular for curling and skating in winter. A stone sign welcomes visitors into the estate from the entrance off the A749 East Kilbride Road opposite a pub, &#x27;Auld Cathkin&#x27; (previously the Cathkin Hotel and The Braes), and a long-standing Chinese restaurant. A short way further south on the Springhall side of the A749 is the unusual white castellated villa &#x27;Elpalet&#x27;, designed by the housebuilder John McDonald (whose companies constructed thousands of new homes in Glasgow in the 1930s, including hundreds in Burnside), to be his own residence. The property is now divided into apartments.

A 13-storey tower block (the only building of such height in Rutherglen, although there are 10 towers of the same design in Cambuslang) looms over the centre of the neighbourhood; it was built on the site of the Springhall mansion house that once occupied the land, which came to public attention in the 1910s, first when suffragette Frances Gordon was imprisoned for attempting to set the house on fire, then soon afterwards when a contingent of Belgian refugees of World War I were invited to stay there; it was demolished in the 1940s. Adjacent to the tower is a sports pitch in a wire mesh pen.

Cathkin High School, the secondary school affiliated to Loch Primary, is located nearby at the western side of the neighbouring estate of Whitlawburn – administratively this is part of Cambuslang, although shares some amenities with Springhall, with the schemes connected under the main road by a pedestrian underpass. A standalone pre-school facility, Springlaw ELC (intentionally named after both communities as a gesture of unity) was built on a piece of vacant land off Cruachan Road, opening in 2021.

====Cathkin====

Cathkin is the southernmost and highest part of Rutherglen, largely comprising a post-World War II estate which underwent a good deal of regeneration of its housing stock in the early 21st century. The estate borders the City of Glasgow (the Cathkin Braes Country Park and farmland belonging to the village of Carmunnock, also a civil parish in which Cathkin, along with Fernhill and Spittal, was located historically) and offers views over the Greater Glasgow valley. There is a small wooded area near the neighbourhood&#x27;s eastern boundary with Whitlawburn. Limited amenities include a primary school with community facilities, and a church (located a short way into Fernhill and designed to serve both communities, as was the school) while local shops off Cathkin Bypass / Cuillins Road feature a supermarket, newsagent and betting shop. Like several parts of the town, a 21st-century stone and metal entrance sign welcomes visitors entering Cathkin from the bypass road.

The grounds of the old Cathkin House mansion (built 1799, and a children&#x27;s home in the later 20th century) now converted to apartments, offer views over Rutherglen and Glasgow beyond. The mansion (now Category B listed) is surrounded by small separate residential developments, primarily of large villas, which also enclose around the buildings of Mid Farm, one of the oldest surviving properties in the area. Burnside Road, an ancient drovers&#x27; route winding downhill towards Rutherglen, no longer has a connection for vehicles with Cathkin Road (the B759, running east-west between the A749 dual carriageway and Carmunnock village via Cathkin Braes Park and Cathkin Braes Golf Club). A local landmark at that junction was a thatched cottage which was the childhood home of 19th-century missionary James Gilmour, but it has since been demolished.

==Education==
Loch Primary and Cathkin Primary are feeder schools for Cathkin High School (built in 1970, rebuilt in 2008), which is located at Whitlawburn just outside the Rutherglen boundaries and is primarily the secondary school for Cambuslang. Conversely, two schools located in Cambuslang (James Aiton and Park View) are feeders for Stonelaw High in Rutherglen, along with Bankhead, Burgh, Burnside, Calderwood and Spittal Primaries within the burgh.

Trinity High (to which St Anthony&#x27;s, St Mark&#x27;s and St Columbkille&#x27;s Primaries are affiliated) is the only Catholic secondary school for both towns, as is the case for Rutherglen High School, the local Additional Support Needs facility which shares a campus with Cathkin High.

All council-run schools in the South Lanarkshire area were rebuilt between the late 1990s and 2010s.

==Sport==
Rutherglen Glencairn F.C. compete in the . The club was formed in 1896 and has won the famous Scottish Junior Cup on four occasions (1901–02, 1918–19, 1926–27, 1938–39). Glencairn moved into a brand new stadium (New Southcroft Park, currently sponsored by Celsius Cooling and renamed as The Celsius Stadium) situated in the Burnhill area of Rutherglen in 2009 following the demolition of the old ground (Southcroft Park), where they had played for over 100 years. The &quot;Glencairn Venue&quot; building on Glasgow Road, which is on part of the old site – the rest now being under the M74 motorway – is owned by the football club, although the company operating in the building is a separate entity. In the same season as their move, Glencairn won the West of Scotland League Central District First Division with a record points total, followed by claiming the West of Scotland Super League First Division at the first attempt in 2009–10. They won the latter competition again in 2018–19 to access the top tier of Junior football in the west of Scotland, and were runners-up in the Scottish Junior Cup in 2022–23 Scottish Junior Cup.

Clyde Football Club played in the area at Shawfield Stadium for 88 years before moving on in 1986, eventually settling in the former new town of Cumbernauld. The immediate area could be considered the cradle of Scottish football: Hampden Park, the national stadium and home to Scotland&#x27;s oldest football club Queen&#x27;s Park is close by to the west along with Cathkin Park, the home of the defunct Third Lanark; not far to the north is Celtic Park, the home of Celtic – all of which (apart from Clyde&#x27;s former ground) are located in the City of Glasgow.

In addition to men&#x27;s amateur teams (such as Stonelaw AFC (current) and formerly Rutherglen AFC of the Scottish Amateur Football League), the town also had a women&#x27;s football club, Rutherglen Ladies, which was formed in 1921 and played at a high level throughout the 20s and 30s. More recently Rutherglen Girls FC was founded in 2012 and features three age group teams plus a senior women&#x27;s team competing in the SWFL, Central/South East Division.

Coats Park, home of Cambuslang RFC (rugby union) is on the periphery of Burnside; the local athletics club Cambuslang Harriers is also based there. There are council-run football facilities as well as a 25-metre swimming pool and gym at South Lanarkshire Lifestyle Eastfield (next to Trinity High School), and a GAA field, Pearse Park (disused for several years in the early 21st century), is also in Eastfield. In Shawfield there is an indoor trampoline facility, while Topgolf opened a driving range in Farme Cross (adjacent to the motorway) in 2022; traditional golf has been played at the Cathkin Braes club on the southern edge of Rutherglen since the 1880s.

==Notable people==

&quot;Several notable persons born between 1978 and 1998 are &#x27;from&#x27; Rutherglen per their birth certificates, but have only a tenuous link to the town due to being delivered at Rutherglen Maternity Hospital which operated between these years; many children born here would have grown up in Glasgow, East Kilbride or elsewhere.&quot;

<text>Anthony Patrick Hadley (born 2 June 1960) is an English pop singer. He rose to fame in the 1980s as the lead singer of the new wave band Spandau Ballet and launched a solo career following the group&#x27;s split in 1990. Hadley returned to the band in 2009 but left again in 2017. Hadley has been noted for his expressive voice and vocal range.

==Early life==
Anthony Patrick Hadley was born the first of three children at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, North London. He has a sister, Lee, and a brother, Steve. His father, Patrick Hadley, worked as an electrical engineer for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, and his mother, Josephine, worked for the local health authority. Hadley grew up listening to artists such as Queen, Roxy Music, Marc Bolan, Rod Stewart, Elton John and Be-Bop Deluxe, while his parents introduced him to artists such as Frank Sinatra, Jack Jones, Tony Bennett, Ella Fitzgerald and Johnny Mathis.

==Spandau Ballet==

Hadley co-founded Spandau Ballet in 1976 as the Cut, with Gary Kemp, Steve Norman, John Keeble and Michael Ellison, all of whom were students at Dame Alice Owen&#x27;s Grammar School. As a member of Spandau Ballet, Hadley went on to enjoy international success in the 1980s, including hits such as &quot;True&quot;, &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Through the Barricades&quot;, as well as appearing at Live Aid in 1985.

As the lead singer of Spandau Ballet, Hadley became known for his suave image, as well as his powerful voice, which was described by AllMusic as a &quot;dramatic warble&quot;. In his book on the New Romantics, music journalist and author Dave Rimmer described his voice &quot;like a foghorn—if a foghorn could be imagined trying to emulate both [Frank] Sinatra and [David] Bowie&quot;. His Spandau Ballet bandmate Steve Norman described him as having &quot;a massive vocal range&quot;. According to Tim Rice, Hadley had a &quot;strong and expressive voice that few of his contemporaries came near to matching&quot;.

Spandau Ballet disbanded in 1990 after their final studio album, &quot;Heart Like a Sky&quot;, failed to live up to the critical and commercial success of their earlier albums, such as &quot;True&quot; and &quot;Parade&quot;, and was not released in the United States.

In April 1999, Hadley, along with fellow band members Steve Norman and John Keeble, failed in their attempt to sue Gary Kemp, the band&#x27;s songwriter, for a share of his royalties. On 25 March 2009, it was confirmed that the band had re-formed with Hadley and were embarking on a tour of the UK and Ireland in October 2009. Hadley remained a member of the band intermittently until 2017, when he announced his permanent departure. He later said in 2020: &quot;I&#x27;d rather be happy on my own than be in that band again.&quot;

==Solo==
===1992–1996: &quot;The State of Play&quot; and &quot;When Saturday Comes&quot;===
After Spandau Ballet disbanded, Hadley pursued a solo career, signing to EMI and recording his first album, &quot;The State of Play&quot;, in 1992. The album spawned three singles, but neither it nor any of the singles achieved any kind of chart success, and after one final single, &quot;Absolution&quot;, released in the summer of 1993, Hadley was subsequently dropped. After leaving EMI, Hadley formed his own record company, SlipStream Records, and his first release was the single &quot;Build Me Up&quot;, from the soundtrack of the film &quot;When Saturday Comes&quot;.

In 1996, Hadley performed in a BBC Radio 2 live performance of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, playing the title role opposite Roger Daltrey&#x27;s Judas.

=== 1997–2000: &quot;Tony Hadley&quot; and collaborations ===
On his return from that tour, Hadley collaborated with Tin Tin Out on their hit &quot;Dance With Me&quot;, which reached #35 on the UK singles chart, and was the first in a series of electronic, dance and house collaborations over the course of the next three years. In May 1997, Hadley signed a joint deal with PolyGram TV, and released his next eponymous solo album, which included covers and songs that were chosen to match his voice. The album also featured some of his own self-penned songs, such as &quot;She&quot;, which he wrote for daughter Toni. The album spawned three singles, but none charted and the album only reached number 45 in the UK.

In 1999, Alan Parsons chose Hadley as the lead singer for the track &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; on his album &quot;The Time Machine&quot;.

=== 2000–2002: &quot;Unreleased House Album&quot; ===
Following a number of successful collaborations with other house artists and DJs, Hadley became the subject of some newfound respect in the 2000s, rooted in an &quot;ironic&quot; appreciation for Spandau Ballet. This saw him begin work on album of solo euro-house material, which remains unreleased, after signing a deal with European label Frontera Recordings. Two singles from the project were released to markets in continental Europe, with &quot;Will U Take Me&quot; being released in November 2000 and &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot; in March 2002, neither of which sparked enough interest for the album to be released.

Back on home soil, fearing that the project was too far removed from his origins with Spandau Ballet, Hadley released an EP of four new songs, &quot;Get So Lonely&quot;, on his own label, Blueprint Recordings, in the summer of 2001. Meanwhile, &quot;Debut&quot; and &quot;Obsession&quot;, two live albums featuring recordings taken from a performance in Cologne in 1992 and Ronnie Scott&#x27;s in 1999 respectively, were released in limited numbers by small-budget labels. The summer of 2002 saw Hadley reunite with former band members John Keeble and Steve Norman for a tour entitled &quot;An Evening of Gold&quot;, under the moniker Hadley, Norman and Keeble.

=== 2003–2005: &quot;Reborn in the USA&quot; and &quot;True Ballads&quot; ===
Although a collaboration with Marc et Claude followed in April 2002, no further singles from the house album were released; and by the autumn of 2002, Hadley had signed up to participate in the new ITV reality series &quot;Reborn in the USA&quot;. Hadley beat ten other artists, including Peter Cox, Michelle Gayle, Elkie Brooks, Sonia, and Leee John, to win the prize of a recording contract with Universal Music. The resulting album was &quot;True Ballads&quot;, a compilation of three re-recorded hits from the Spandau Ballet days, ten tracks from his 1997 self-titled album, and two new songs: a cover of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Make You Love Me&quot;, which he performed on the show, and &quot;After All This Time&quot;, the theme song from the BBC drama series &quot;Down to Earth&quot;, which ran from 2000 until 2005.

Following his success on the show, Hadley continued with a busy performing schedule, and co-headlined a tour with Cox, performing songs from both the 
Go West and Spandau Ballet back catalogues, as well as number of covers. The tour spawned a live album and DVD, both of which were released in 2004. The following year, Hadley co-headlined another tour, this time with Martin Fry of ABC, in very much the same vein; performing both ABC and Spandau Ballet songs. A live album and DVD of this tour was released in 2005.

=== 2006–2008: &quot;Passing Strangers&quot; ===
2006 saw the release of Hadley&#x27;s first solo album in nine years, a jazz-swing album entitled &quot;Passing Strangers&quot;. The album consisted of eighteen tracks, both covers and original songs, and was laid out in the format of a vinyl album, described by Hadley as being a &quot;nod&quot; to the good old days. In support of the album, Hadley headlined a &quot;By Request&quot; tour from March to May 2006, followed by a big band tour later in the year.

Hadley performed a set with several other 1980s acts at the &quot;Retro Fest&quot; on 1 September 2007 at Culzean Castle in Ayrshire, Scotland, which saw him reunite with Fry and Cox for a special rendition of &quot;Addicted to Love&quot;, with Fry and Cox.

In February 2008, Hadley took part in the Italian Sanremo Festival, where he duetted in both English and Italian with contestant Paolo Meneguzzi on Meneguzzi&#x27;s song, &quot;Grande&quot; (&quot;Big&quot;), during the third day of the contest, where all contestants re-interpreted their songs with guest artists. On 22 February 2008, he performed as an interval act at the semi-final of Dora 2008, the selection of the Croatian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest. By the summer of 2008, rumours of a Spandau Ballet reunion had reached the press and in the summer of 2009, a reunion tour with the original line-up was announced.

=== 2011–2014: Spandau Ballet hiatus ===

After two successful years touring, Spandau Ballet once again entered hiatus in June 2010. In 2011, Hadley stated that his solo career has been more financially rewarding than his period at the top of the charts with Spandau Ballet. He stated that 2008 was his best-ever earning year, having performed in over 220 shows. In 2012, Hadley recorded a career-spanning set of hits from Metropolis Studios, which was released in a limited edition CD/DVD box set the following year. In 2013, Hadley and 1980s chart peers Kim Wilde, Bananarama and Go West set a new world record for Comic Relief when they performed the highest ever gig, singing on a Boeing 767 aeroplane at 43,000 ft (13,000 m).

In 2014, Hadley took part in the prime-time RAI TV show &quot;La Pista&quot; as team leader of the Tacco 10 female dance troupe. Over the course of the competition, Hadley performed both Spandau Ballet&#x27;s &quot;Gold&quot;, as well as &quot;Rio&quot;, originally a hit for rival band Duran Duran. The summer of 2014 saw the release of a new solo single, &quot;Take Back Everything&quot;, before a further tour with Spandau Ballet to celebrate the band&#x27;s 35th Anniversary was confirmed for the summer of 2015. Although recorded several years before, an unreleased album of Christmas songs was released on 27 November 2015, shortly after the conclusion of the tour.

=== 2017–2021: &quot;Talking to the Moon&quot; ===
On 3 July 2017, Hadley announced on Twitter that due to circumstances beyond his control, he was no longer a member of Spandau Ballet. Towards the end of 2017, Hadley duetted with Jane McDonald on the song &quot;I See It in Your Eyes&quot;, from her album &quot;Hold the Covers Back&quot;. &quot;Talking to the Moon&quot;, Hadley&#x27;s first album of original solo material since &quot;Passing Strangers&quot;, was released in the summer of 2018, backed by the single &quot;Tonight Belongs to Us&quot;, and also including &quot;Take Back Everything&quot;, despite it having been released four years earlier. A tour in support of the album followed in the autumn. Subsequently, work on a follow-up album began in early 2020, with &quot;Obvious&quot;, the first single recorded for the project, being released on 12 June.

Later in the year, Hadley was one of the featured vocalists on the single &quot;The Best Christmas (in Lockdown)&quot;, a charity assemble of around one-hundred celebrities recording for the Hertfordshire-based Electric Umbrella organisation. In 2021, Hadley appeared alongside Marcella Detroit, Jools Holland and Glen Matlock on a charity version of the Robbie Williams song &quot;Angels&quot;, recorded in tribute to the producer Steve Brown and with funds going to the late producer&#x27;s COVID-19 charity.

=== 2022–present: &quot;40th Anniversary Tour&quot; ===
On 18 February 2022, Hadley released his first solo single in over two years, &quot;Because of You&quot;, an up-tempo number that marked a distinct change in his sound from previous solo material. During March and May 2022, Hadley embarked on a 40-date tour of the United Kingdom to celebrate his 40th Anniversary in the music business. The tour was scheduled for 2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tour concluded with four special additional dates in October 2022, which saw Hadley backed by a full orchestra.

==Other work and awards==

<text>Steven Antony Norman (born 25 March 1960) is an English musician who plays tenor saxophone, guitar, percussion and other instruments, for the English new romantic band Spandau Ballet.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Steve Norman was born in Stepney, east London, and was considered a musical child prodigy. He started pursuing an interest in popular music as a guitarist in a Dame Alice Owen&#x27;s School band called The Cut with Gary Kemp, Tony Hadley and John Keeble in 1976. The band was later named The Makers, The Gentry and then Spandau Ballet.

===Spandau Ballet===
Spandau Ballet signed with Chrysalis Records. By the third Spandau Ballet album, Norman brought percussion to the mix and introduced the tenor saxophone, which has since become his signature instrument. With Spandau Ballet, Norman toured the globe and continued to have hits throughout the 1980s. In 1985 Norman appeared with the band at Live Aid at Wembley Stadium.

Because of a dispute over royalties, the band split up in the early 1990s. After a 20-year hiatus, newspaper reports claimed early in 2009 that Spandau Ballet was set to reform later that year. On 25 March 2009, Norman, Gary Kemp, Martin Kemp, Tony Hadley and John Keeble announced their reunion at a press conference on board . The band also announced their &#x27;Reformation Tour&#x27; starting in October 2009.

Norman co-wrote the song &quot;Once More&quot; which became the first new Spandau Ballet single in 20 years.

===After Spandau Ballet===
In the early 1990s after the band went their separate ways, Norman moved to Ibiza and took some time off from performing. During his time on the island, Norman collaborated with numerous musicians and producers who lived there, including Lenny Krarup, Nacho Sotomayor, Stefan Zauner and DJ Pippi. Norman also worked with Rafa Peletey on various projects, including Funky Jack&#x27;s &quot;Saxomatic&quot; percussion mix. Norman also sourced and compiled the music for the &quot;Made in Ibiza Chills n&#x27; Thrills&quot; compilation album and co-compiled &quot;A Journey Through Savannah&quot; with Peletey for their record label, Island Pulse Records.

Norman continued to play live at house music events throughout the UK and on the international club scene, performing with his saxophone, or occasionally percussion alongside such musicians as Byron Stingily of Ten City, Frankie Knuckles, Angie Brown, Steve Edwards, Alison Limerick, Jeremy Healy and Brandon Block. Norman formed a partnership with Hed Kandi, DJ John Jones and Martin Ikin from Soul Purpose called &#x27;The Collective&#x27;. Their first production was a re-working of Joe Smooth&#x27;s &quot;Promised Land&quot; featuring Peyton on lead vocals and Shelley Preston (formerly of Bucks Fizz) on backing vocals. 

In 2012 and again in 2014, Norman was the featured guest saxophonist and percussionist for Steve Harley’s performances of the first two Cockney Rebel albums with orchestra and choir. In 2013, Norman played on three tracks on Bruce Foxton&#x27;s album, &quot;Back in the Room&quot;. He also played on James Stevenson&#x27;s album &quot;Everything&#x27;s Getting Closer To Being Over&quot; released in 2014. The band he is performing live with as of 2021 is called The Sleevz.

Norman has performed at various concerts in aid of The Prince&#x27;s Trust charity. He also played at the &quot;Free Nelson Mandela Concert&quot; some years later along with Tony Hadley.

===Cloudfish===
In 2001, Norman and Rafa Peletey formed a production team called Cloudfish and invited Shelley Preston to provide the vocals. As a result, Cloudfish became a band with Norman, Preston and Peletey writing and producing their own songs. Peletey left in 2003 to front his own band, joining up with Norman and Preston from time to time.

Cloudfish have continued to write, produce and perform and were featured artists on the eponymous CD of the Italian quintet, Quintessenza. Cloudfish sold out a number of concerts including the one at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s. Their song &quot;So High&quot; was included on the CD compilation, &quot;Dome Ibiza: The Chillout Session Vol. 2&quot;.

==Personal life==
Norman writes a regular column reviewing CDs for the magazine &quot;Ibiza Now&quot;.

Norman&#x27;s first wife was Carmen Norman De Arquero. They were married from 1990 until their divorce in 2000. Together they have two children, a son named Jack, and a daughter named Lara.

Norman later married ex-Bucks Fizz singer Shelley Preston. The marriage ended after more than thirteen years when they divorced in 2015.

He is a fan of Tottenham Hotspur F.C.

<doc id="265219" wikidata="Q463113" url="?curid=265219" title="Etta Jones">
<text>Etta Jones (November 25, 1928 – October 16, 2001) was an American jazz singer. Her best-known recordings are &quot;Don&#x27;t Go to Strangers&quot; and &quot;Save Your Love for Me&quot;. She worked with Buddy Johnson, Oliver Nelson, Earl Hines, Barney Bigard, Gene Ammons, Kenny Burrell, Milt Jackson, Cedar Walton, and Houston Person.

==Biography==
=== Early Life ===
Jones was born in Aiken, South Carolina, where her parents named her after another Etta Jones, a member of the Dandridge Sisters. She was raised in Harlem, New York, where she began performing as a teenager. After she impressed Buddy Johnson at an amateur night at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, he invited her to join his band as a vocalist while his sister, Ella Johnson, was on maternity leave. Still in her teens, she joined the band for a tour although she was not featured on record. Her first recordings—&quot;Salty Papa Blues&quot;, &quot;Evil Gal Blues&quot;, &quot;Blow Top Blues&quot;, and &quot;Long, Long Journey&quot;—were produced by Leonard Feather in 1944, placing her in the company of clarinetist Barney Bigard and tenor saxophonist Georgie Auld. 

=== Recording Career ===
In 1947, she recorded and released an early cover version of Leon René&#x27;s &quot;I Sold My Heart to the Junkman&quot; (previously released by the Basin Street Boys on Rene&#x27;s Exclusive label) while at RCA Victor Records. She performed with the Earl Hines sextet from 1949 to 1952.

During the 1950s, Jones sought to obtain a recording contract, while working as a seamstress, elevator operator, and album stuffer. In 1956, she released the album &quot;The Jones Girl...Etta...Sings, Sings, Sings.&quot; She obtained a contract in 1960 with Prestige Records after impressing Prestige&#x27;s preparatory director, Esmond Edwards, with her singing&#x27;s warmth and phrasing via an unsolicited demo tape. Her first single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go to Strangers,&quot; hit number five on the Rhythm and Blues chart, and 36 in pop charts, at a time when pop charts were dominated by white men. Over the next three years, she recorded ten albums for Prestige. Her favorite songwriter to cover was Sammy Cahn, and she also favored Harold Arlen, George and Ira Gershwin, and Cole Porter.

=== Partnership with Houston Person ===
Following these recordings, on which Jones was featured with high-profile arrangers such as Oliver Nelson and jazz stars such as Frank Wess, Roy Haynes, and Gene Ammons, she had a musical partnership of more than 30 years with tenor saxophonist Houston Person, who received equal billing with her. He also produced her albums and served as her manager after the pair met in one of Johnny &quot;Hammond&quot; Smith&#x27;s bands.

Although Etta Jones is likely to be remembered above all for her recordings on Prestige, she had a very productive musical career in the last two decades of her life. She had a close professional relationship with Person (frequently, but mistakenly, identified as Jones&#x27;s husband), and they performed together for decades. Starting in 1976, they began recording for Muse, which later changed its name to HighNote. Person became her manager, as well as her record producer and accompanist, in a partnership that lasted until her death in 2001. They performed up to 200 times a year until she had to stop due to her health. Jones had dealt with cancer for more than a decade until the time of her death and had a mastectomy and chemotherapy.

=== Legacy and death ===
Only one of her recordings—her debut album for Prestige Records (&quot;Don&#x27;t Go to Strangers&quot;, 1960)—enjoyed commercial success with sales of more than 1 million copies. However, her remaining seven albums for Prestige, and beginning in 1976, her recordings for Muse Records, and for HighNote Records secured her a devoted following. She had three Grammy nominations: for the &quot;Don&#x27;t Go to Strangers&quot; album in 1960, the &quot;Save Your Love for Me&quot; album in 1981, and &quot;My Buddy&quot; (dedicated to her first employer, Buddy Johnson) in 1998. In 2008, the album &quot;Don&#x27;t Go to Strangers&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 1996, she recorded the jazz vocalist tribute album, &quot;The Melody Lingers On,&quot; for the HighNote label. Her last recording, a tribute to Billie Holiday, was released on the day of Jones&#x27;s death.

She died in Mount Vernon, New York, at the age of 72, from cancer. Jones was survived by her husband, John Medlock, and a granddaughter, Lia Greatheart-Mitchell. Pearson arranged her funeral at one of their frequent performance venues, a church in Mount Vernon, New York. Jazz musicians including Melba Liston played tribute to Jones at the funeral.

Jones earned the Eubie Blake Jazz Award and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Women in Jazz Foundation.

<text>Glyndebourne () is an English country house, the site of an opera house that, since 1934, has been the venue for the annual Glyndebourne Festival Opera. The house, located near Lewes in East Sussex, England, is thought to be about six hundred years old and listed at grade II.

==History of the house==
&quot;There had been a manor house at Glynde Bourne (as it was often spelt) since the fifteenth century&quot;, but the exact age of the house is unknown. Some surviving timber framing and pre-Elizabethan panelling makes an early 16th-century date the most likely. In 1618, it came into the possession of the Hay family, passing to James Hay Langham in 1824. He inherited his father&#x27;s baronetcy and estate in Northamptonshire in 1833 which under the terms of his inheritance should have led to him relinquishing Glyndebourne, but as a certified lunatic he was unable to do so. After litigation the estate passed to a relative, Mr Langham Christie, but he later had to pay £50,000 to persuade another relative to withdraw a rival claim.

Langham Christie&#x27;s son, William Langham Christie, made substantial alterations to the house in the 1870s. First, a brick extension hid its 17th-century façade, while ornate stonework and balustrading was added. Then, in 1876, the architect Ewan Christian was engaged to install bay windows and add decorative brickwork to give the house the Jacobethan appearance which can still be seen from the gardens today. Some of the exterior of the older parts of the house can be seen from the driveway next to the theatre.

==Swiss origins of the Christie family==
Langham Christie was the son of one Daniel Christin, a Swiss of obscure origins who anglicised his name to Christie on entering the army of the East India Company. According to frequently published accounts, Daniel Christin joined the Bombay Engineers rising to the rank of major, and the family fortune was made when he was given a hoard of gems by a Sultan in thanks for having prevented his troops from pillaging a harem.

Unfortunately none of these claims finds ready support in the records of East India Company or indeed in any accounts of the period. The rank of major seems to have been a later invention. There was indeed a Major Christie of the Madras Engineers, however he was shot dead by a Cossack near the river Aras in 1812, some three years after Daniel Christie had died. In his will, Daniel Christie refers to himself as formerly a captain in the service of the English East India Company under the presidency of Bombay, there being no mention of higher rank or of an engineering connection. The Christie family pedigree cites Daniel Christie&#x27;s dates of promotion, first to Lieutenant in 1781 and to Captain in 1783, however no records to support these claims have been offered or traced thus far.

The only Daniel Christie to be found for this period in the East India Company records is a surgeon&#x27;s mate of the Sixth Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry. The Christie family pedigree claims that in 1782 Christin served in the war against Hyder Ali in Mysore. That Hyder Ali died in that year and that there was extensive looting by East India Company soldiers from Ali&#x27;s palace, as was commonplace throughout the Anglo-Mysore Wars, is perhaps suggestive.

Whatever the truth regarding his origins, rank or source of sudden wealth, Daniel Christie undoubtedly returned to England with a fortune estimated at £20,000 (equivalent to about £35 million in 2021 values), and his second marriage to Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Purbeck Langham, ultimately brought Glyndebourne into the Christin/Christie family.

==Origins of the opera house==
John Christie obtained the use of the house in 1913 after the death of William Langham Christie, his grandfather. He came into full legal possession of the estate in 1920. Among other renovations, he added to the house an organ room, long, in the process almost doubling the length of the south façade of the house. This room contained one of the largest organs outside of a cathedral in the country. It was built by the firm of Hill, Norman &amp; Beard Ltd (bought by Christie in 1923). After the Second World War, John Christie made a gift of sections of the soundboards, pipes and structural parts to the rebuilt Guards Chapel, Wellington Barracks (which had been destroyed in the Blitz); the case and console remain at Glyndebourne.

John Christie&#x27;s fondness for music led him to hold regular amateur opera evenings in this room. At one of these evenings in 1931, he met his future wife, the Sussex-born Canadian soprano Audrey Mildmay, a singer with the Carl Rosa Opera company who had been engaged to add a touch of professionalism to the proceedings. They were married on 4 June 1931. During their honeymoon, they attended the Salzburg and Bayreuth festivals, which gave them the idea of bringing professional opera to Glyndebourne, although Christie&#x27;s original concept was for it to be similar to the Bayreuth Festival. As their ideas evolved, the concept changed to focus on smaller-scale productions of operas by Mozart more suited to the intimate scale of the planned theatre.

==The first theatre==

As an annex to the organ room, the Christies built a fully equipped and up-to-date theatre with a 300-seat auditorium and an orchestra pit capable of holding a symphony orchestra. 
Christie engaged conductor Fritz Busch as the first music director, Carl Ebert, the Intendant of Berlin&#x27;s Städtische Oper as artistic director, and Rudolf Bing became general manager until 1949. All three men were exiles from Nazi Germany.

After extensive rehearsals, the first six-week season opened on 28 May 1934 with a performance of &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; followed by &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;. Boyd Neel had conducted the first music heard in the renovated Glyndebourne opera house in 1934, in private performances, at John Christie&#x27;s invitation.

John Christie&#x27;s original theatre was soon enlarged and improved many times after its initial construction. As early as 1936 its capacity was increased to 433; by 1952 it held nearly 600, and finally, in 1977, it held 850 people. In addition, a rehearsal hall was constructed.

Productions were interrupted by the Second World War, during which time the house became an evacuation centre for children from London. After 1945 the festival slowly began again. Until 1951, the entire burden of financing the opera festival was undertaken by John Christie himself, but, in 1952, the Glyndebourne Festival Society was formed to take over the financial management. Christie&#x27;s death in 1962 resulted in his son George (later Sir George) taking over, and additional changes and improvements to the theatre continued.

Hill, Norman and Beard built the pipe organ in 1924, and it gradually expanded over the years. John Christie owned a considerable share in the company. Currently, the organ is a gutted shell, the pipes having been donated to various churches for the construction of new organs after World War II. The organ originally contained four manuals and 46 stops, but this was eventually expanded to 106 stops, unusual for an English-built organ in having multiple diapason chorus ranks of pipes.

A short semi-documentary film was made in 1955 entitled &quot;On Such a Night&quot;, featuring excerpts from that year&#x27;s production of &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; and with glimpses of John Christie, Vittorio Gui and Carl Ebert, interwoven with fictional story about an American going there for the first time.

==The present theatre==

By the late 1980s the theatre&#x27;s expansion, which had proceeded in a somewhat piecemeal fashion, included an agglomeration of outbuildings which housed restaurants, dressing rooms, storage and other facilities. It became clear to George Christie that a completely new theatre - and not just an enlargement of the old one - was necessary. Having chosen the architects Michael and Patty Hopkins of Hopkins Architects in a design competition, Christie announced in 1990 that a new theatre, capable of seating 1,200 people, would be constructed in 1992.

The old theatre hosted its last festival in 1992, and construction of a brand-new theatre began. It was completed at a cost of £34 million, 90 per cent of which was raised through donations, which gave the donors control of 28% of the seats. The inaugural performance in the new theatre on 28 May 1994, given 60 years to the day after the old theatre&#x27;s first performance, was &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;.

The design of the theatre, a large brick oval building, has resulted in a four-level, horseshoe-shaped auditorium with main level seating, two balconies, and a gallery topped with a circular roof. The over high stage building is semi-circular in shape and allows for the efficient flying and storage of scenery. The acoustics, by Derek Sugden and Rob Harris of Arup Acoustics, have received praise.

==Education==
Since its establishment in 1986, Glyndebourne&#x27;s education department has undertaken an array of projects within the local community. Schools around the Sussex and Kent area often visit the venue for performances and workshops. Youth opera projects are also undertaken such as the recent production of for 14- to 19-year-olds and the previous Hip H&#x27;Opera project in 2006 - timed to coincide with the 250th anniversary of Mozart&#x27;s birth. The department has also worked with HMP Lewes since 1988 in projects such as inmate-designed puppet shows influenced by works such as Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot;.

==Wind turbine==

Glyndebourne has featured windmills for many years. A post-mill, erected in 1706, was used until 1921, but collapsed in 1925, and the trestle timbers were blown down in 1964.

Glyndebourne applied for planning permission to Lewes District Council for a wind turbine in January 2007. The council granted permission in July 2007, but the decision was called in by the Secretary of State because of the wider implications of the proposal for renewable energy development in the South Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and strong opposition from countryside protection groups and local residents. On 10 July 2008, the Secretary of State granted planning permission.

In 2008–9, Glyndebourne erected a temporary mast on Mill Plain to monitor meteorological conditions for a year, prior to erection of the turbine. The data collected showed lower wind levels than had been predicted at this location, perhaps because 2008–9 had lower wind levels than usual. The turbine was launched in January 2012. In the first five years since it was launched, the turbine generated the equivalent of 102% of Glyndebourne&#x27;s annual electricity requirements, outperforming its annual target of 90%.

<text>Milton Jackson (January 1, 1923 – October 9, 1999), nicknamed &quot;Bags&quot;, was an American jazz vibraphonist. He is especially remembered for his cool swinging solos as a member of the Modern Jazz Quartet and his penchant for collaborating with hard bop and post-bop players.

A very expressive player, Jackson differentiated himself from other vibraphonists in his attention to variations on harmonics and rhythm. He was particularly fond of the twelve-bar blues at slow tempos. On occasion, Jackson also sang and played piano.

==Biography==

Jackson was born on January 1, 1923, in Detroit, Michigan, United States, the son of Manley Jackson and Lillie Beaty Jackson. Like many of his contemporaries, he was surrounded by music from an early age, particularly that of religious meetings: &quot;Everyone wants to know where I got that funky style. Well, it came from church. The music I heard was open, relaxed, impromptu soul music&quot; (quoted in Nat Hentoff&#x27;s liner notes to &quot;Plenty, Plenty Soul&quot;). He started on guitar when he was seven, and then on piano at 11.

While attending Miller High School, he played drums, timpani and violin, and also sang in the choir. At 16, he sang professionally in a local touring gospel quartet called the Evangelist Singers. He took up the vibraphone at 16 after hearing Lionel Hampton play the instrument in Benny Goodman&#x27;s band. Jackson was discovered by Dizzy Gillespie, who hired him for his sextet in 1945, then his larger ensembles. Jackson quickly acquired experience working with the most important figures in jazz of the era, including Woody Herman, Howard McGhee, Thelonious Monk, and Charlie Parker.

In the Gillespie big band, Jackson fell into a pattern that led to the founding of the Modern Jazz Quartet: Gillespie maintained a former swing tradition of a small group within a big band, and his included Jackson, pianist John Lewis, bassist Ray Brown, and drummer Kenny Clarke (considered a pioneer of the ride-cymbal timekeeping that became the signature for bop and most jazz to follow) while the brass and reeds took breaks. When they decided to become a working group in their own right, around 1950, the foursome was known at first as the Milt Jackson Quartet, becoming the Modern Jazz Quartet (MJQ) in 1952. By that time Percy Heath had replaced Ray Brown.

Known at first for featuring Jackson&#x27;s blues-heavy improvisations almost exclusively, in time the group came to split the difference between these and Lewis&#x27;s more ambitious musical ideas. Lewis had become the group&#x27;s musical director by 1955, the year Clarke departed in favour of Connie Kay, boiling the quartet down to a chamber jazz style, that highlighted the lyrical tension between Lewis&#x27;s mannered, but roomy, compositions, and Jackson&#x27;s unapologetic swing.

The MJQ had a long independent career of some two decades until disbanding in 1974, when Jackson split with Lewis. The group reformed in 1981, however, and continued until 1993, after which Jackson toured alone, performing in various small combos, although agreeing to periodic MJQ reunions. From the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, Jackson recorded for Norman Granz&#x27;s Pablo Records, including &quot;Jackson, Johnson, Brown &amp; Company&quot; (1983), featuring Jackson with J. J. Johnson on trombone, Ray Brown on bass, backed by Tom Ranier on piano, guitarist John Collins, and drummer Roy McCurdy.

In 1989, Jackson was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from the Berklee College of Music.

His composition &quot;Bags&#x27; Groove&quot; is a jazz standard. (&quot;Bags&quot; was a nickname given to him by a bass player in Detroit. &quot;Bags&quot; referred to the bags under his eyes. ) He was featured on the NPR radio program &quot;Jazz Profiles&quot;. Some of his other signature compositions include &quot;The Late, Late Blues&quot; (for his album with Coltrane, &quot;Bags &amp; Trane&quot;), &quot;Bluesology&quot; (an MJQ staple), and &quot;Bags &amp; Trane&quot;.

Jackson died of liver cancer in Manhattan, New York, at the age of 76. He was married to Sandra Whittington from 1959 until his death; the couple had a daughter.

<doc id="265229" wikidata="Q5256447" url="?curid=265229" title="Health claim">
<text>A health claim on a food label and in food marketing is a claim by a manufacturer of food products that their food will reduce the risk of developing a disease or condition. For example, it is claimed by the manufacturers of oat cereals that oat bran can reduce cholesterol, which will lower the chances of developing serious heart conditions. Vague health claims include that the food inside is &quot;healthy,&quot; &quot;organic,&quot; &quot;low fat,&quot; &quot;non-GMO,&quot; &quot;no sugar added,&quot; or &quot;natural&quot;.

Health claims are also made for over-the-counter drugs and prescription drugs, medical procedures, and medical devices, but these generally have a separate, much more stringent set of regulations.

== Health claims in the United States ==

In the United States, health claims on nutrition facts labels are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), while advertising is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission. Dietary supplements are regulated as a separate type of consumer item from food or over-the-counter drugs.

===Food===
==== FDA guidelines ====
According to the FDA, &quot;Authorized health claims in food labeling are claims that have been reviewed by FDA and are allowed on food products or dietary supplements to show that a food or food component may reduce the risk of a disease or a health-related condition.&quot; An authorized health claim is limited to evidence for reducing the risk of a disease, and does not apply to the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, or treatment of disease. It must be reviewed, evaluated, and publicly-announced by the FDA prior to use.

Approval of a health claim by the FDA requires significant scientific agreement (SSA) among reputable scientists that the claim is based on publicly-available evidence that a relationship exists between an element and a disease. The SSA standard provides a high degree of confidence that the relationship between the element and the disease is valid.

Based on scientific evidence, such claims may be used for marketing on foods or dietary supplements. The authorized health claim must be written in a way that helps consumers understand the importance of including the element in their daily diet.

The FDA has guidelines for what is considered a misleading label, and also monitors and warns food manufacturers against labeling foods as having specific health effects when no evidence exists to support such statements, such as for one manufacturer in 2018.

A &quot;qualified health claim&quot; is supported by some scientific evidence, but does not meet the significant scientific standard of evidence required for an authorized health claim. Qualified health claims must be accompanied by a disclaimer or other qualifying language to accurately communicate the level of scientific evidence supporting the claim.

====Consumer advocacy====

The use of the label “Healthy” on a variety of foods has been a particular issue for many food quality advocacy groups. In general, claims of health benefits for specific foodstuffs are not supported by scientific evidence and are not evaluated by national regulatory agencies. Additionally, research funded by manufacturers or marketers has been criticized to result in more favorable results than those from independently funded research.

===Dietary supplements===
In the United States, these claims, usually referred to as &quot;qualified health claims&quot;, are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the public interest.

The rule in place before 2003 required &quot;significant scientific consensus&quot; before a claim could be made, applying characterization of a hierarchy of degrees of certainty:
* A: &quot;There is significant scientific agreement for [the claim].&quot;
* B: &quot;Although there is some scientific evidence supporting [the claim], the evidence is not conclusive.&quot;
* C: &quot;Some scientific evidence suggests [the claim]. However, the FDA has determined that this evidence is limited and not conclusive.&quot;
* D: &quot;Very limited and preliminary scientific research suggests [the claim]. The FDA concludes that there is little scientific evidence supporting this claim.&quot;

See the Wikipedia article on dietary supplements for a description of current FDA policy.

== Health claims in Canada ==
== Health claims in Europe ==
In the European Union, the European Food Safety Authority provides regulations on food labeling to address the quality of possible health foods.

In the United Kingdom by law any health claim on food labels must be true and not misleading. Food producers may optionally use the (discontinued in 2010) Joint Health Claims Initiative to determine whether their claims are likely to be legally sustainable.

In early 2005 the European PASSCLAIM project (Process for the Assessment of Scientific Support for Claims on Foods), sponsored by the European Union and coordinated by ILSI-Europe (https://web.archive.org/web/20090822045739/http://europe.ilsi.org/), ended. The aim of this project was to develop criteria for the scientific substantiation of claims on foods. Several hundreds of scientists from academia, research institutes, government and industry have contributed to the project. All the resulting papers can be downloaded for free from http://www.ilsi.org/Europe/Pages/PASSCLAIM_Pubs.aspx. The final consensus paper, comprising the final set of criteria, has been published in June 2005 in the European Journal of Nutrition.

<doc id="265230" wikidata="Q4828333" url="?curid=265230" title="Averoigne">
<text>Averoigne is a fictional counterpart of a historical province in France, detailed in a series of short stories by the American writer Clark Ashton Smith. Smith may have based Averoigne on the actual province of Auvergne, but its name was probably influenced by the French department of Aveyron, immediately south of Auvergne, due to the similarity in pronunciation. Sixteen of Smith&#x27;s stories take place in Averoigne. In Smith&#x27;s fiction, the Southern French province is considered &quot;the most witch-ridden in the entire country.&quot; The most well-known citizen is Gaspard du Nord of Vyones, a wizard who translated &quot;The Book of Eibon&quot; into Norman French.

== Fictional history ==

In ancient times, Smith depicts Averoigne as having been settled by the fictional Gallic tribe called the Averones. They established a number of settlements in the region, many of which were fortified when the Roman Empire absorbed the region. When Christianity spread through the Empire, many churches and monasteries were established among the ruins of Druidic temples. Greatest among these was a great cathedral constructed in Vyones, completed in 1138.

== Fictional geography ==
Averoigne is depicted by Smith as being located in the southern half of France. The northern half of the territory is dominated by the walled city of Vyones, site of an impressive cathedral. In the southern half is located the town of Ximes; the main road of Averoigne runs between Ximes and Vyones, straight through the thick, dark forest that blankets the province. A river called Isoile flows from the mountains in the northern part of the province to feed into a swamp in the south.

Other towns and villages depicted by Smith as being located in Averoigne include: Moulins, Les Hiboux, La Frenâie, Touraine, Sainte Zenobie, and Périgon. In the forest can be found haunted ruins, such as the Château of Fausseflammes and the stronghold of Ylourgne. (It was from that abandoned abode of evil robber barons, that the horrific events of &quot;The Colossus of Ylourgne&quot; had their start.)

==Reception==
In 1993, Stefan Dziemianowicz wrote in &quot;Dark Eidolon: The Journal of Smith Studies&quot; that &quot;&quot;The Colossus of Ylourgne&quot;, with its series of increasingly bizarre events culminating in the rampage of the most awesome monster to appear in Smith&#x27;s fiction, comes closest of any of the Averoigne tales to evoking the sense of wonder in Smith&#x27;s otherworldly fantasies... Smith appears to be saying that even the sorcerors of Averoigne are unable to transcend their flawed humanity.&quot;

<doc id="265232" wikidata="Q26427" url="?curid=265232" title="Common gull">
<text>The common gull (Larus canus) is a medium-sized gull that breeds in cool temperate regions of the Palearctic from Iceland and Scotland east to Kamchatka in the Russian Far East. Most common gulls migrate further south in winter, reaching the Mediterranean Sea, the southern Caspian Sea, and the seas around China and Japan; northwest European populations are at least partly resident. The closely related short-billed gull was formerly often included in this species, which was then sometimes known collectively as &quot;mew gull&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The common gull was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the current binomial name &quot;Larus canus&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as Europe but this is now restricted to Sweden. The genus name is a Latin word for a seabird, probably a gull. The specific epithet &quot;canus&quot; is also Latin and means &quot;grey&quot;. The name &quot;common gull&quot; was coined by Thomas Pennant in 1768 because he considered it the most numerous of its genus. John Ray earlier used the name &quot;common sea-mall&quot;.

There are many old British regional names for this species, typically variations on &quot;maa&quot;, &quot;mar&quot;, and &quot;mew&quot;. The original English word &quot;mew&quot; is related to German &quot;möwe&quot; and Dutch &quot;meeuw&quot;, and is ultimately onomatopoeic. In Norse influenced regions of Britain, variations include &quot;maw&quot; or &quot;sea-maw&quot;, the old Norfolk form being &quot;mow&quot;. The word &quot;gull&quot; comes from a Celtic root, with the first recorded usage in English from the 1400s; the modern Welsh form is &quot;gwylan&quot;.

===Subspecies===

There are three subspecies, with the Kamchatka gull (&quot;L. (c.) kamtschatschensis&quot;) being considered a potential distinct species by some authorities. 
The North American short-billed gull was formerly widely considered conspecific with this species (as &quot;Larus canus brachyrhynchus&quot;), but most authorities now accept it as a distinct species &quot;L. brachyrhynchus&quot;, based on differences in genetics, morphology and calls. Though the name &quot;mew gull&quot; was then widely used outside of North America as its unique subspecific name, this name was also used in North America for &quot;Larus canus&quot; as a whole, so the name &quot;short-billed gull&quot; was chosen for &quot;L. brachyrhynchus&quot; by the American Ornithological Society (AOS) to avoid confusion with this North American usage of mew gull to denote all forms of the &quot;L. canus&quot; complex. The revival of the name short-billed gull in some of the same literature for &quot;L. brachyrhynchus&quot;, and that that short-billed gull was used historically for &quot;L. brachyrhynchus&quot; when it was treated as a distinct species in the first to third editions of the AOU (now AOS) checklist (in which the name mew gull, contrary to more recent usage, was specifically reserved for the Old World subspecies).

==Description==
Adult common gulls are long and a wingspan of , noticeably smaller than the herring gull and slightly smaller than the ring-billed gull. It is further distinguished from the ring-billed gull by its shorter, more tapered bill, which is a more greenish shade of yellow and is unmarked during the breeding season. The body is grey above and white below. The legs are yellow in breeding season, becoming duller in the winter. In winter, the head is streaked grey and the bill often has a poorly defined blackish band near the tip, which is sometimes sufficiently obvious to cause confusion with ring-billed gull. They have black wingtips with large white &quot;mirrors&quot; on the outer primaries p9 and p10, which are smaller than those in the short-billed gull. Young birds have scaly black-brown upperparts and a neat wing pattern, and pink legs which become greyish in the second year before tuning yellow. By the first winter, the head and belly are white, with fine streaks and greyish feathers grow on the saddle. They take three years (up to four in the Kamchatka subspecies) to reach maturity. The call is a high-pitched &quot;laughing&quot; cry.

==Distribution==
The common gull breeds in the northern Palearctic from Iceland eastwards to northeast Siberia. It is mainly migratory and winters in Europe, the Mediterranean, Black and Caspian seas, Persian Gulf; Sea of Okhotsk, Japan, Korean Peninsula to southeast China.

It occurs as a scarce winter visitor to coastal eastern Canada and as a vagrant to the northeastern USA. The Kamchatka gull is occasionally seen in northwestern North America mainly in spring, and there is one autumn record in Newfoundland.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Breeding===
The common gull usually breeds colonially, but can be solitary. Both sexes make a lined nest on the ground or in a small tree near water or in marshes. Usually three eggs are laid (sometimes just one or two). They are incubated by both parents and hatch after 24–26 days. The chicks are precocial but remain in the vicinity of the nest. They are cared for by both parents and fledge when aged around 35 days. 

===Food and feeding===
Like most gulls, they are omnivores and will scavenge as well as hunt small prey. The global population is estimated to be about one million pairs; they are most numerous in Europe, with over half (possibly as much as 80-90%) of the world population. By contrast, the short-billed gull population in Alaska is only about 10,000 pairs.

The village&#x27;s name comes from the Old English &quot;Wēoh&quot; meaning &quot;idol&quot; or &quot;shrine&quot;. Wye may have been used for worship by the pre-Christian Angles.

Wye became an important communications centre because of a ford across the River Great Stour connecting with ancient trackways across the North Downs. Romans constructed a road between Canterbury and Hastings using the gap through the North Downs and there have been suggestions the straight Olantigh Road may have been built by them as a separate route from Wye to Canterbury on the east of the River Stour. Remains of an ironworks at the west bank of the river, from that period, have been found. By medieval times, Wye had a market and hosted the local hundred court.

In 1798, Hasted described Wye as:-

Later in the 18th century a turnpike had bypassed the village on the west bank of the River Stour, which the A28 road still does today. Wye railway station was built for the South Eastern Railway line from Ashford to Margate and opened on 1 December 1846.

===RAF Wye===

During World War I the Royal Flying Corps established an unpaved aerodrome off Bramble Lane near Wye Railway Station. It became RAF Wye in 1918 but closed the following year. , it is farmland.
===Wye Racecourse===

Wye Racecourse&#x27;s inaugural 1849 meeting was held in Fanscombe Valley, an isolated coombe and natural amphitheatre directly north of Wye Crown, and as the crow flies from Wye village. Flat racing took place annually on Oak Leaf Day, 29 May coinciding with Wye Fair.

By 1878, Wye&#x27;s racing had moved to the National Hunt course on Harville Road. Steeplechase meetings were held in September, January, March, and May until 1974, and the course closed permanently by June 1975. , both former courses are farmland.

===Wye Court===

As early as the 6th century Wye was a royal vill, and the royal court would have resided in the vicinity of Wye Court for part of the year. In the 13th century it was a Royal Manor whose Liberty extended as far as Hawkhurst. The Palace complex by then was at Wye Court.

Wye was important for being the first ford over the River Stour that travellers could cross on their route from the West Country to Dover.

In 1307, King Edward II spent Christmas at Wye Court between the death of his father King Edward I, and his own coronation the following February. The father had received his Seal from the Officer of State there. Young King Henry VI visited Wye Court in 1428 when Cardinal Kempe of Olantigh was his Lord Chancellor.

The Manor House at Wye Court was a large building, with a circular dungeon that was extant as late as the 19th century and known locally as the &quot;Lollard&#x27;s Hole&quot;. In 1553, two Protestants were executed by burning in front of Wye Church. The disturbances and associated use of the dungeons may have led to that name.

Wye was not isolated from Wat Tyler&#x27;s 1381 uprising or Jack Cade&#x27;s rebellion of 1450. In the 15th century, church officials were ordered especially to address &quot;lollardy in Maidstone, Tenterden, Faverisham and Wy&quot;.

Queen Elizabeth I granted Wye Court to the Boleym related Hunsden family but by the time of King Charles I, ownership had passed to the Finches, a distant branch of the Earls of Winchilsea.
Following the 1572 lightning strike at Wye Church, yeoman farmer Roger Twysden of Wye Court provided timber for reconstruction of the tower. He became High Sheriff of Kent in 1599 but following a fire at his own home he moved from Wye Court to a family dwelling at Chelmington, and then Roydon Hall.

A 1648 Civil War skirmish involving Rich&#x27;s men and cavaliers took place at the entrance to Wye Court on Olantigh Road. Accounts identify four casualties of the encounter being buried at Wye, and three others killed.

By 1732, Wye Court, along with other land near Wye at Harville, Coldharbour, Wye Downs and Naccolt had fallen into the ownership of miser, John &quot;Vulture&quot; Hopkins. Once his affairs had been unravelled the properties were inherited by Benjamin Bond Hopkins (1745–1794). He sold them to John Sawbridge of Olantigh whose son owned Wye Court by 1798.

Wye Court formerly extended beyond the present day farm, including land to Churchfield Way. Wye College purchased parts of Wye Court for expansion along Olantigh Road in 1925. In 1917, Wye Church agreed to purchase a parcel of Wye Court, to extend its graveyard, from Wanley Elias Sawbridge Erle-Drax, a descendant of John Sawbridge. The Long family purchased their present Wye Court farm and former racecourse on Harville Road in 1925.

Entomologist Frederick Theobald lived at Wye Court until he died in 1930. He had moved to Wye to teach at the South Eastern Agricultural College when it opened in 1894. Apart from his work at the college he spent much of his time curating economic zoology and mosquito collections at the British Museum, and ceased lecturing from 1920 in favour of agricultural extension. Theobald&#x27;s research on mosquitos and tropical sanitation earned him international recognition including the Order of Osmanieh and Mary Kingsley Medal.

In September 1940, a Spitfire of No 19 Squadron from RAF Duxford crashed at Wye Court injuring the pilot and writing the aircraft off. The crash site was excavated in 1974 by the RAF Museum.

===Wye College===

Wye College was founded in 1447 as a chantry by Cardinal Kempe. From 1627, a grammar and charity school operated from the premises. In 1894 the buildings re-opened as the South Eastern Agricultural College, offering University of London degrees from 1898, and in 1948 incorporated as Wye College. It merged with Imperial College in 2000 but the campus was progressively closed between 2005 and 2009.

===Imperial College scheme===

In 2005, Imperial College promoted a controversial scheme to develop Wye College as a centre for renewable fuel research / production, and to build 4,000 house in the Kent Downs.The plan was seen as a test case for other attempts to build on Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. In 2006, Ashford Borough Council withdrew support, and Imperial College abandoned its plans. Campaigners hailed the decision to preserve the status of protected areas, and Wye village.

==Landscape==

Wye stands in the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, on the Great Stour at the point where it cuts through the North Downs between Ashford and Canterbury. The village is overlooked by the Wye Downs, an area of chalk downland and woodland within the Wye and Crundale Downs SSSI that includes the Devil&#x27;s Kneading Trough and other coombes formed by periglacial action.

== Culture and community ==
===Wye Farmers Market===

A farmers&#x27; market, founded by former Wye College student and environmentalist Richard Boden, is held by The Green in Wye on the first and third Saturday of every month. There are typically 15 vendors. During COVID-19 restrictions the market operated a virtual shop.

===Wye Village Hall===


Wye Village Hall on Bridge Street was extensively refurbished between 2014 and 2019. There are three function rooms of which the largest can accommodate 180 people.

===Wye Library===

Wye Library is at the top of Bridge Street.

===Wye Church===


The present Anglican Church of Saint Gregory and Saint Martin at the junction of High Street, Church Street and Churchfield Way is grade I listed. Its original dedication was solely to Pope Gregory the Great. Saint Martin was added , possibly to recognise the role of Battle Abbey which was itself dedicated to Saint Martin and owned the Manor of Wye, and to be consistent with Wye College.

A church on the present site was first constructed in 1290, and considerably more extensive than the present building. There was a longer nave and much larger chancel. The Steeple had a tall wooden spire clad with lead. Of this church, only the outer nave walls, built of whole flints, survive. The original door and window openings have all been replaced.

In the 15th century Cardinal Kempe constructed Wye College and rebuilt the church. New, perpendicular style door and window openings matched the college, and the walls were faced with the flat surfaces of split flints. The stronger structure supported a clerestory and fine roof.

In 1548, the Reformation dictated images of the saints be removed, and following 1549&#x27;s introduction of the Anglican prayer book, newly redundant silverware was sold. The rood screen however, between the nave and chancel survived, as did extensive gilded and painted glass.

Five years later, Catholic Queen Mary
(1553–8) reinstated ornamentation and the lighting of candles, but papist resurgence did not stop there. Richard Thornden, Bishop of Dover and Nicholas Harpsfield, Archdeacon of Canterbury committed 10 Protestants to be burnt. Two of them, John Philpot of Tenterden, and Thomas Stephens of Biddenden were consumed by fire at Wye Church gate in January 1557. The next year however, cautiously Anglican Queen Elizabeth I was crowned and Protestant communion restored.

In 1572, the steeple was struck by lightning and burned, melting the lead cladding of the spire. Extensive repairs were finally paid for by 1579, but the structure was reported to be &quot;in much ruin and decay&quot; again by 1581. That may have been caused by the 1580 Dover Straits earthquake. In any event, further repairs to the steeple were carried out in 1582 and 1584.

The &quot;five great bells&quot; had been damaged by the 1572 fire and were finally, satisfactorily recast in 1593, though once raised back into place their weight would have added considerably to stresses on the steeple. In 1628, the wooden spire was replaced once again, but concerns about the state of the chancel, and risk of the steeple falling were not addressed.

On 22 March 1686, the steeple tower collapsed. Almost all the transepts; most of the chancel, and part of the nave were destroyed. The gilded and painted glass windows were gone, as were grand tombs of Cardinal Kempe and his father Thomas. Between 1700 and 1711 the church was reconstructed in its present, smaller form. Charles Finch, 4th Earl of Winchilsea, as holder of the tithes, was required to rebuild the chancel and the parish had to pay the remainder. While the new chancel was finely crafted, work on the much reduced tower prioritised strength and economy. The new church was barely half the size of its predecessor.

Lady Joanna Thornhill, for whom the Lady Joanna Thornhill School is named, died during the period of reconstruction and was buried in the new building she had helped fund.

Since 2011, and , the incumbent (vicar) of the Wye benefice, and area dean of the Deanery of Stour Valley, is the Reverend Ravi Holy. He is an Old Etonian, and formerly an alcoholic; drug abuser; satanist; punk rock musician, member of a Pentecostal congregation. Holy has performed an Elvis themed funeral at Wye. Participation in a &quot;Comedy For Clergy&quot; workshop led to him appearing on BBC London and BBC Breakfast. He performs in the trio &quot;White Collar Comedy&quot; whose tagline is:
===Saint Ambrose Catholic Church===


Saint Ambrose Catholic Church, off Oxenturn Road, is a chapel of ease built in 1954 for the Parish of Saint Teresa of Avila, Ashford. Mass was celebrated in Wye for the first time since the reformation during World War II, when Wye College&#x27;s dining hall was made available to Catholic servicemen and local residents. Subsequently, and before the present building was constructed, a former stable at the Old Vicarage on Bridge Street was used as a chapel.

The pews are from E. W. Pugin&#x27;s original, demolished church of St Teresa in Ashford. Two possibly 18th century benches came from the chapel at Calehill House, Little Chart, itself demolished in 1952.

===Sport===
Wye Cricket Club plays at Horton Meadow off Cherry Garden Lane. In 2014, it received a £2,000 grant from the Wye Children&#x27;s Playing Field Charity

Wye Tennis Club&#x27;s five courts, and a Multi-Use Games Area are located at the Wye Village Hall recreation ground on Bridge Street. The club began in 1971 with two locally constructed courts and use of a football club&#x27;s changing room. A 1980 Portacabin was replaced in 2008 with the present purpose built clubhouse, and by 2012, there were five floodlit courts.

Wye Juniors FC plays football from the former Wye College recreation ground off Cherry Garden Lane. A fire destroyed its pavilion in 2022.

===Lady Joanna Thornhill School===


Lady Joanna Thornhill Primary School, on Bridge Street, is named after the daughter (1635–1708) of Sir Bevil Grenville, second wife of Richard Thornhill of Olantigh, and Woman of the Bedchamber to Queen Catherine of Braganza. Thornhill&#x27;s will funded a charity school for Wye in 1708. She is buried at Wye Church.

Her trust purchased part of Cardinal Kempe&#x27;s chantry buildings at Wye College, and other investment property with which to endow her education institution. Sir George Wheler, who some sources claim was Lady Joanna Thornhill&#x27;s nephew, acquired the buildings south of the chantry&#x27;s cloister in 1713.

Boys attending Lady Thornhill&#x27;s charity school were taught in the Old Hall, and girls the Parlour. Their schoolmaster received £30 per annum salary and the school mistress £20, from rent on property purchased in Wye and on Romney Marsh.

Nevertheless, the situation was poor. In spite of the trust&#x27;s &quot;munificent&quot; annual endowment income of £200, an inspector passed the facilities &quot;but with the greatest reluctance&quot;. He observed the Old Hall used as boys&#x27; schoolroom &quot;though a fine old room, is ill-adapted for a school and requires constant repair&quot;, and bemoaned that &quot;as long as they are allowed to use this old room, the inhabitants of Wye will not lift a finger towards the 
erection of new schools&quot;. His conclusion was that Wye &quot;has about the worst schools in the neighbourhood&quot;.

In 1892, Kent and Surrey County Council purchased the old school premises for £1,000, to establish the South Eastern Agricultural College there, the school ultimately moving to its current location.

, Lady Joanna Thornhill School is operated by The Care Foundation Trust.

===Wye School===

Wye School is a mixed, secondary free school that opened on Olantigh Road in 2013, and expanded into new buildings in 2017. It is operated by United Learning and includes the former Wye College Kempe Centre and Department of Hop Research site.

===Spring Grove School===

Spring Grove School on Harville Road is an independent, fee paying nursery and preparatory school for boys and girls aged 2–11. Its site includes a forest school.

The 10-bedroom 17th century mansion was formerly home of author Joseph Conrad, politician Baroness Trumpington, and clergyman Thomas Brett.

== Landmarks ==

===Wye Bridge===


The present grade II* listed bridge over the River Stour was built in 1638 to replace a wooden structure; repaired in 1684, and altered in 1881. It has five stone arches over the river, and secondary ones between the river and railway line. The stone parapet was removed in 1881 when an iron roadway was constructed to reinforce the original stone structure. A stone memorial plaque recording the 1683 construction and 1684 repairs is preserved in the Church of Saint Gregory and Saint Martin.

The weir downstream of the bridge was constructed in 1962 to replace an earlier one.

===Wye Mill===


The 18th century brick built mill house; timber framed mill building, and mill race are grade II listed. It was originally a water mill for grinding corn.

===Railway===

Until 2022, the level crossing gates at Wye railway station had been manually operated. Road closures of typically 10–12 minutes, and sometimes up to 15 minutes, for trains to pass had been reported. One resident produced a telephone app to advise residents when the barrier was closed, and help them choose when to travel.

<doc id="265242" wikidata="Q263455" url="?curid=265242" title="The Brown Bunny">
<text>The Brown Bunny is a 2003 independent erotic romantic road drama film written, directed, produced, photographed, and edited by Vincent Gallo. Starring Gallo and Chloë Sevigny, it tells the story of a motorcycle racer on a cross-country drive who is haunted by memories of his former lover. It was photographed with handheld 16 mm cameras in various locations throughout the United States, including New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Ohio, Missouri, Utah, Nevada, and California.

Following a world premiere at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, the film garnered a great deal of media attention because of an explicit scene where Sevigny performs unsimulated fellatio on Gallo, as well as a feud between Gallo and the film critic Roger Ebert. Ebert stated that &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; was the worst film in the history of Cannes, although he later gave a re-edited version his signature &quot;thumbs up&quot;, awarding the film three out of four stars.

The film received mixed and heavily polarized reviews from critics, and was nominated for several accolades, including the Palme d&#x27;Or. It won the FIPRESCI Prize from the Viennale. The film has since gained a small cult following.

==Plot==
Motorcycle racer Bud Clay undertakes a cross-country drive, following a race in New Hampshire, in order to participate in a race in California. All the while he is haunted by memories of his former lover, Daisy. On his journey he meets three women, but Bud seems to be a lost soul, and he is unable to form an emotional connection with any of them. He first meets Violet at a gas station in New Hampshire and persuades her to join him on his trip. They stop at her home in order to get her clothes, but he drives off as soon as she enters the house.

Bud&#x27;s next stop is the home of Daisy&#x27;s parents, the location of Daisy&#x27;s brown bunny. Daisy&#x27;s mother does not remember Bud, who grew up in the house next door, nor does she remember having visited Bud and Daisy in California. Next, Bud stops at a pet shelter, where he asks about the life expectancy of rabbits (he is told it is about five or six years). At a highway rest stop, he meets a distressed woman, Lilly. He comforts and kisses her, before starting to cry and eventually leaving her. Bud appears more distressed as the road trip continues, crying as he drives. He stops at the Bonneville Speedway to race his motorcycle. In Las Vegas, he drives around prostitutes on street corners, before deciding to ask one of them, Rose, to join him for a lunch. She eats McDonald&#x27;s food in his truck until he stops, pays her, and leaves her back on the street.

After having his motorcycle checked in a Los Angeles garage, Bud stops at Daisy&#x27;s house, which appears abandoned. He leaves a note on the door frame, after sitting in his truck in the driveway remembering about kissing Daisy in this place and checks in at a hotel. Daisy eventually appears there. She seems nervous, going to the bathroom twice to smoke crack cocaine, while Bud waits for her, sitting on his bed. As she proposes to go out to buy something to drink, Bud tells her that, because of what happened the last time they saw each other, he does not drink anymore.

They have an argument about Daisy kissing other men. At this point, Bud undresses Daisy and she fellates him. Once done, he insults her as they lie in bed, talking about what happened during their last meeting. Bud continuously asks Daisy why she had been involved with some men at a party. She explains that she was just being friendly and wanted to smoke marijuana with them. Bud becomes upset because Daisy was pregnant, and it transpires that the baby died as a result of what happened at this party.

Through flashback scenes, the viewer understands that Daisy was raped at the party, a scene witnessed by Bud, who did not intervene. Daisy asks Bud why he did not help her, and his feelings of guilt about this are considerable. He tells her that he did not know what to do, and so he decided to leave the party. After he came back a bit later, he saw an ambulance in front of the house and Daisy explains to Bud that she is dead, having passed out prior to the rape and then choked to death on her own vomit. Bud awakens the next morning, alone; his encounter with Daisy turns out to have been a figment of his imagination. The movie ends as Bud is driving his truck in California, alone again and still not with what he needs.

==Cast==
* Vincent Gallo as Bud Clay
* Chloë Sevigny as Daisy Lemon
* Cheryl Tiegs as Lilly
* Elizabeth Blake as Rose
* Anna Vareschi as Violet
* Mary Morasky as Mrs. Lemon

==Production and release==
Gallo conceived the film&#x27;s title before writing its story. He is fond of the color brown, and rabbits are his favorite animal.

The film was shot in 16 mm and then blown up in 35 mm, which gives the photography a typical &quot;old-school grain&quot;. Gallo reportedly shot the film using two Aaton 16mm cameras, Super Baltar lenses, a Nagra IV-STC recorder, and an Angénieux zoom lens purchased from The Stanley Kubrick Estate. Vincent Gallo credited himself as director of the photography as well as one of the three camera operators along with Toshiaki Ozawa and John Clemens.

During the film&#x27;s production, Gallo stated that he became &quot;almost maniacal&quot; in trying to create the film. He personally painted Bud&#x27;s motorcycle, which appears in the film&#x27;s opening race sequence, &quot;dozens of times to get just the right shade of gold.&quot; Gallo stated that he fainted twice during the film&#x27;s production, due to exhaustion from working.

The film&#x27;s opening race scene was shot at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway. The U.S. theatrical version of the film has been cut by about 25 minutes compared to the version shown at Cannes, removing a large part of the initial scene at the race track (about four minutes shorter), about six minutes of music and black screen at the end of the film, and about seven minutes of driving before the scene in the Bonneville Speedway.

Neither Anna Vareschi nor Elizabeth Blake, both in the film, were professional actresses. Kirsten Dunst and Winona Ryder were both attached to the project but left. In an interview from &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Sevigny said of the sex scene: &quot;It was tough, the toughest thing I&#x27;ve ever done, but Vincent was very sensitized to my needs, very gentle... And we&#x27;d been intimate in the past.&quot; Actress Jennifer Jason Leigh was initially set to play the role that Sevigny played, including the unsimulated oral sex scene, but ultimately turned the role down due to being in a relationship at the time.

For the film&#x27;s promotion, a trailer was released featuring a split screen in the style of Andy Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot;, depicting on one side of the screen a single point-of-view-shot of a driver on a country road, and the other side various scenes from the end of the film featuring Chloë Sevigny. Neither side of the screen had any audio tracks attached, although the song &quot;Milk and Honey&quot; by folk singer Jackson C. Frank played over the trailer&#x27;s duration.

==Themes and analysis==
Gallo, a conservative and teetotaler, has stated that he views &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; as &quot;a celebration of America that is virulently anti-drug and anti-pornography.&quot; The film explores themes of masculinity, depression, loneliness, social alienation, romantic love, and self-esteem.

The film also uses flower motifs, with Bud Clay&#x27;s four female romantic interests each being named after flowers: Daisy, Lily, Rose, and Violet.

The film&#x27;s title is evoked three time within the film, referencing Daisy&#x27;s pet bunny, a bunny seen in a pet store by Clay, and to a chocolate bunny that Bud once gave to Daisy. Film critic Richard von Busack of &quot;Metroactive&quot; interpreted that when Clay asks How long do these bunnies live?&#x27;...he&#x27;s really asking, &#x27;How long does love last?&#x27; and he&#x27;s chilled by the pet-store owner&#x27;s answer: &#x27;Five or six years at the most.

On the film&#x27;s sex scene, Randy Kennedy of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film&#x27;s &quot;sex scene does seem like the antithesis of pornography. The camera and microphones are so close to the characters that the familiar sense of voyeuristic distance is impossible to maintain.&quot; Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that the film&#x27;s controversial sex scene &quot;and its dialogue, and a flashback to the Daisy character at a party, work together to illuminate complex things about Bud&#x27;s sexuality, his guilt, and his feelings about women...Gallo takes the materials of pornography and repurposes them into a scene about control and need, fantasy and perhaps even madness. That scene is many things, but erotic is not one of them.&quot;

&quot;The Georgetown Voice&quot; also called the sex scene &quot;Raw, gripping and slightly repulsive&quot;, comparing it to a similar scene in &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot;, while emphasizing the un-erotic nature of both. &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; reached a similar conclusion, describing the sex scene as &quot;almost nothing really sexy or pleasurable. It&#x27;s desperate, hollow: a lover reaching for emotions that have shriveled up.&quot;

In 2018, Gallo further explained the film&#x27;s anti-pornographic themes, writing in an open letter:

The Brown Bunny was an attempt at maintaining illusions and simultaneously presenting a heightened and enhanced version of reality, while hoping to result in new forms of insight into pathological behavior.

I was also interested in a character that even during sex could not let his mind go blank and fill up with the sex. Instead, while having sex he is rapidly thinking and his thoughts have a range of emotions far away from pleasure. This strange behavior juxtaposed against graphic real sex is disturbing.

The common purpose of pornography is to enhance sexual pleasure or sexual fantasy...I chose to use imagery common in pornography but placed these images in the emotional context which included intense guilt, anger, regret, anguish, and confusion. In this context, it is difficult for the images to enhance sexual pleasure or sexual fantasy. Instead, the graphic images work better to enhance the discomfort of intimacy.

&quot;The Georgetown Voice&quot; concluded that &quot;Whether Bud Clay represents the modern individual condemned to mechanical sex, like T.S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, or serves as a reflection of the male condition at the intersection of love, sex and possession, &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; is Gallo&#x27;s brutal depiction of one man&#x27;s tragic reality.&quot;

Steven Hyden of &quot;Grantland&quot; similarly opined that &quot;&quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; can be viewed as a depiction of the neediness and alienation at the core of traditional masculinity. Its final scene is perhaps best read as a critique of pornographic imagery, and a demonstration of how disturbing real live sex onscreen can be when human feeling isn&#x27;t forcibly removed.&quot;

Filmmaker Josh Safdie also wrote that &quot;No matter how many times you run it over in your head, no matter how many times you act it out, ride a motorcycle, hit the road, you&#x27;re alone with yourself and you always come back to the same thoughts and that is loneliness...That is why &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; is Gallo&#x27;s best work. Self expression at its dire straights [sic] and most important.&quot; Filmmaker David Lowery described the film as a self-flagellation of &quot;male ego&quot;.

Film critic Tony McKibbin also observed the film&#x27;s focus on American culture, writing: &quot;As [Clay] travels from St Louis to Salt Lake City, Gallo shows us the &#x27;Other America&#x27;, the offscreen space of a Hollywood cinema that usually suggests all the fret and anxiety lies at the end of a gun rather than in bills to pay, poor diets, low salaries and illness. This the reality Gallo is attuned to as he conveys the pockets of a life.&quot;

Charles Taylor of &quot;Salon.com&quot; similarly wrote that &quot;Anyone who has ever driven for any stretch through any part of America will recognize the look of the film immediately...the view driving through suburban neighborhoods, the feel of entering some quiet enclave simply by turning a corner, the sense that everything is sleeping yet alive...It&#x27;s all so familiar it feels as if the images have been plucked from your brain, and yet I can&#x27;t recall any movie that has gotten the look of America that this one has...Even the hookers who approach Bud&#x27;s van at every corner aren&#x27;t the usual overdone movie hookers. They look like real people in awful circumstances, and each one makes you wonder, what&#x27;s her story?&quot;.

==Controversies==

===Cannes reception===
The film was entered into the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. It was reportedly heckled as the film began, with the crowd jeering every time Gallo&#x27;s name appeared during the credits. Seiichi Tsukada, an executive at Kinetique, the Japanese company that provided the financing for &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot;, said &quot;I was at Cannes. I felt injustice. The bashing in Cannes is not for &quot;Brown Bunny&quot;. I think they&#x27;re bashing Vincent. I don&#x27;t know why.&quot;

Upon ending, Gallo stated that the film also received a 15-minute standing ovation. Sevigny&#x27;s publicist, Amanda Horton, also stated that the film was applauded for 10 minutes.

Gallo later stated that the Cannes premiere was &quot;the worst feeling I ever had in my life.&quot;

====Gallo–Ebert feud====

After the Cannes premiere, a war of words erupted between Gallo and film critic Roger Ebert, with Ebert writing that &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; was the worst film in the history of Cannes. Ebert also wrote that Sevigny &quot;reportedly cried during the screening&quot;, a statement repudiated by both Gallo and Sevigny&#x27;s publicist, Amanda Horton.

Gallo retorted by calling Ebert a &quot;fat pig with the physique of a slave trader.&quot; Paraphrasing a statement attributed to Winston Churchill, Ebert responded with, &quot;It is true that I am fat, but one day I will be thin, and he will still be the director of &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot;.&quot; Gallo then claimed to have put a hex on Ebert&#x27;s colon, cursing the critic with cancer. In response, Ebert quipped that watching a video of his colonoscopy had been more entertaining than watching &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot;.

Gallo subsequently stated that the hex had actually been placed on Ebert&#x27;s prostate and that he had intended the comment to be a joke which was mistakenly taken seriously by a journalist. He also conceded to finding Ebert&#x27;s colonoscopy comment to be an amusing comeback.

A shorter, re-edited version of the film played later in 2003 at the Toronto International Film Festival (although it still retained the controversial sex scene). The new version was regarded more highly by some, even Ebert, who gave the new cut three stars out of a possible four.

In 2004, Gallo appeared on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, and discussed his feud with Ebert, saying they had made peace. Ebert called into the show and talked with Gallo, and the two laughed and joked about their feud. However, Gallo continued to push back on Ebert&#x27;s claim that the original and re-edited versions of the film were vastly different.

On the August 28, 2004, episode of the television show &quot;Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot;, Ebert gave the new version of the film a &quot;thumbs up&quot; rating. In a column published about the same time, Ebert reported that he and Gallo had made peace. According to Ebert:

In 2018 (five years after Ebert&#x27;s death), however, Gallo once again rebuked Ebert&#x27;s statement, calling it &quot;both far-fetched and an outright lie.&quot; According to Gallo, &quot;If you didn&#x27;t like the unfinished film at Cannes, you didn&#x27;t like the finished film, and vice versa.&quot; Gallo went on to speculate that Ebert wanted to distance himself from &quot;a brutal, dismissive review of a film that other, more serious critics eventually felt differently about.&quot; In addition, Gallo incorrectly claimed, contrary to media reports, that the film&#x27;s final cut was only eight minutes shorter than the Cannes cut, not 26 minutes shorter as Ebert had noted.

===Sex scene===
The film&#x27;s sex scene, in which Sevigny performs unsimulated oral sex upon Gallo, received an overwhelmingly negative critical response at its Cannes premiere. It became a media scandal, with many critics speculating whether Sevigny had been pressured into performing a sex act by Gallo.

In August 2004, upon the film&#x27;s limited theatrical release in the United States, Sevigny took to defending the film and its final scene, stating &quot;It&#x27;s a shame people write so many things when they haven&#x27;t seen it. When you see the film, it makes more sense. It&#x27;s an art film. It should be playing in museums. It&#x27;s like an Andy Warhol movie.&quot;

Despite the negative backlash toward Sevigny&#x27;s involvement in the film, some critics praised her decision. &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer Manohla Dargis said: 

Seven years later, in an interview for &quot;Playboy&quot;″s January 2011 issue, Sevigny talked about the oral sex scene in the film: &quot;What&#x27;s happened with that is all very complicated. There are a lot of emotions. I&#x27;ll probably have to go to therapy at some point. But I love Vincent. The film is tragic and beautiful, and I&#x27;m proud of it and my performance. I&#x27;m sad that people think one way of the movie, but what can you do? I&#x27;ve done many explicit sex scenes, but I&#x27;m not that interested in doing any more. I&#x27;m more self-aware now and wouldn&#x27;t be able to be as free, so why even do it?&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; received mixed reviews from critics and holds a rating of 47% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 96 reviews with an average score of 5.3/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus states &quot;More dull than hypnotic, &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; is a pretentious and self-indulgent bore.&quot; Metacritic gives the film a score of 51 out of 100 based on reviews from 30 critics, indicating &quot;Mixed or average reviews&quot;.

French cinema magazine &quot;Les Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; voted &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; one of the ten best films of 2004. American publication &quot;Film Comment&quot; included it among the best unreleased films of 2003, ranking it 14th. In 2010, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; went on to list &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; as one of the 100 &quot;defining&quot; films of the decade, calling it the decade&#x27;s &quot;most reviled&quot; film, but saying it was &quot;destined to become a future lost classic.&quot;

The film won the FIPRESCI Prize at the Vienna International Film Festival for its &quot;bold exploration of yearning and grief and for its radical departure from dominant tendencies in current American filmmaking&quot;. The film, aside from the feud with Roger Ebert, gained some positive reaction from American critics as well. Neva Chonin of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called it &quot;a somber poem of a film sure to frustrate those who prefer resolution to ambiguity... like an inscrutably bad dream, [it] lingers on.&quot;

Conversely, Moria McDonald of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; gave the film a negative review, calling it a &quot;self-indulgent and seemingly endless road movie&quot;.

The film was praised by other filmmakers including Claire Denis, Jean-Luc Godard, John Waters, Sean Penn, and Werner Herzog who called it &quot;the best portrayal of the particular loneliness a man feels.&quot; Filmmaker Josh Safdie listed it among the top 10 greatest films of all time, in the 2012 Sight &amp; Sound poll. In 2023, filmmaker David Lowery listed &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; among his top five favorite films.

===Box office===
According to &quot;The Numbers&quot;, the film grossed $366,301 domestically, and $264,126 internationally, for a worldwide total of $630,427. It was domestically released in 19 theaters.

&quot;The Numbers&quot; also reported that the film had a production budget of $10 million, though this has not been confirmed by Gallo. Gallo declined to reveal the exact cost of the film, but stated &quot;most of the money that was spent on the movie was spent to do very technical things that are very modern, like intermediary digital processing, uncompressed editing, film composition techniques.&quot; He also added that the film&#x27;s crew never exceed three people during production.

Multiple publications have referred to the film&#x27;s production budget as very low, contrasting greatly with the reported $10 million number.

==Soundtrack==
The motion picture soundtrack to &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; was released exclusively in Japan. The first five tracks come from artists Gordon Lightfoot, Jackson C. Frank, Matisse/Accardo Quartet, Jeff Alexander and Ted Curson. The last five tracks are performed by John Frusciante.

===Soundtrack re-release===
Australian indie label Twelve Suns re-issued &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot; soundtrack on deluxe gatefold vinyl on April 26, 2014. This reissue was fully authorized by Vincent Gallo and remastered from his master recordings. The re-issue was limited to 1000 copies. The first 5 tracks are from the film &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot;. The last 5 tracks were written before the movie and used as inspiration during filming.

==Home media==
In the U.S., Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the film on DVD on August 16, 2005.

<doc id="265248" wikidata="Q73136" url="?curid=265248" title="Stanley Kramer">
<text>Stanley Earl Kramer (September 29, 1913February 19, 2001) was an American film director and producer, responsible for making many of Hollywood&#x27;s most famous &quot;message films&quot; (he called his movies &quot;heavy dramas&quot;) and a liberal movie icon. As an independent producer and director, he brought attention to topical social issues that most studios avoided. Among the subjects covered in his films were racism (in &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot; and &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot;), nuclear war (in &quot;On the Beach&quot;), greed (in &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;), creationism vs. evolution (in &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;), and the causes and effects of fascism (in &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot;). His other films included &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952, as producer), &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; (1954, as producer), and &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; (1965).

Director Steven Spielberg described him as an &quot;incredibly talented visionary&quot; and &quot;one of four great filmmakers, not just for the art and passion he put on screen, but for the impact he has made on the conscience of the world.&quot; Kramer was recognized for his fierce independence as a producer-director, with author Victor Navasky writing that &quot;among the independents...none seemed more vocal, more liberal, more pugnacious than young Stanley Kramer.&quot; His friend Kevin Spacey, during his acceptance speech at the 2015 Golden Globes, honored Kramer&#x27;s work, calling him &quot;one of the great filmmakers of all time.&quot;

Despite uneven critical reception, both then and now, Kramer&#x27;s body of work has received many awards, including 16 Academy Awards and 80 nominations, and he was nominated nine times as either producer or director. In 1961, he received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award. In 1963, he was a member of the jury at the 3rd Moscow International Film Festival. In 1998, he was awarded the first NAACP Vanguard Award in recognition of &quot;the strong social themes that ran through his body of work&quot;. In 2002, the Stanley Kramer Award was created, to be awarded to recipients whose work &quot;dramatically illustrates provocative social issues&quot;.

== Early life ==
Kramer was born in New York City. His parents were Jewish, and having separated when he was very young, he remembered little about his father. His mother worked at a New York office of Paramount Pictures, during which time his grandparents took care of him at home. His uncle, Earl Kramer, worked in distribution at Universal Pictures.

Kramer attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, where he graduated at age fifteen. He then enrolled in New York University, where he became a member of the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity and wrote a weekly column for the &quot;Medley&quot; magazine. He graduated in 1933 at the age of nineteen with a degree in business administration. After developing a &quot;zest for writing&quot; with a newspaper, biographer Donald Spoto wrote, Kramer was offered a paid internship in the writing department of 20th Century Fox and moved to Hollywood. Until receiving that writing job, he had planned to enroll in law school.

==Film career==

===Move to Hollywood===
Over the following years, during the period of the Great Depression, Kramer took odd jobs in the film industry: He worked as a set furniture mover and film cutter at MGM, as writer and researcher for Columbia Pictures and Republic Pictures, and associate producer with Loew-Lewin productions. Those years as an apprentice writer and editor helped him acquire an &quot;exceptional aptitude&quot; in editing and develop the ability to understand the overall structure of the films he worked on. They enabled him to later compose and edit &quot;in camera,&quot; as he shot scenes.

He was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1943 during World War II, where he helped make training films with the Signal Corps in New York, along with other Hollywood filmmakers including Frank Capra and Anatole Litvak. He left the army with the rank of first lieutenant.

After the war, Kramer soon discovered that there were no available jobs in Hollywood in 1947, so he created an independent production company, Screen Plays Inc. He partnered with writer Herbie Baker, publicist George Glass and producer Carl Foreman, an army friend from the film unit. Foreman justified the production company by noting that the big studios had become &quot;dinosaurs,&quot; which, being shocked by the onrush of television, &quot;jettisoned virtually everything to survive.&quot; But they failed to develop cadres of younger creative talent in their wake.

===Producer===
Kramer&#x27;s new company was able to take advantage of unused production facilities by renting time, allowing him to create independent films for a fraction of the cost the larger studios had required, and he did so without studio control. Kramer also saw this as an opportunity to produce films dealing with subjects the studios previously avoided, especially those about controversial topics.

However, Kramer soon learned that financing such independent films was a major obstacle, as he was forced to approach banks or else take on private investors. He did both when necessary. But with studios no longer involved, rival independent companies were created which all competed for those limited funds. According to Byman, &quot;there were no fewer than ninety-six&quot; other companies in competition during that period, and included some of Hollywood&#x27;s biggest names: Frank Capra, John Ford, William Wyler, Howard Hawks, Leo McCarey, and George Stevens. Kramer explained how he tried to differentiate his new company from the others, explaining he was less interested in the money than having the ability to make a statement through his films:
The first movie produced under his production company was the comedy &quot;So This Is New York&quot; (1948), directed by Richard Fleischer, and based on Ring Lardner&#x27;s &quot;The Big Town.&quot; It failed at the box office. It was followed with &quot;Champion&quot; (1949), another Lardner story, this one about an ambitious and unscrupulous boxer. Written by Foreman, it was tailored to the talents of Kirk Douglas, a former amateur wrestler who was now an actor. Filmed in only 23 days with a relatively small budget, it became an immense box-office success. It won an Academy Award for Best Editing, with four other nominations, including Douglas for best actor and Foreman as screenwriter.

Kramer next produced &quot;Home of the Brave&quot; (also 1949), again directed by Mark Robson, which became an even bigger success than &quot;Champion&quot;. The story was adapted from a play by Arthur Laurents, originally about anti-Semitism in the army, but revised and made into a film about the persecution of a black soldier. Byman notes that it was the &quot;first sound film about antiblack racism.&quot; The subject matter was so sensitive at the time, that Kramer shot the film in &quot;total secrecy&quot; to avoid protests by various organizations. Critics generally liked the film, which, notes Nora Sayre, &quot;had a flavoring of courage.&quot;

His renamed Stanley Kramer Company produced &quot;The Men&quot; (1950), which featured Marlon Brando&#x27;s screen debut, in a drama about paraplegic war veterans. It was the first time Kramer and Foreman worked with director Fred Zinnemann, who had been directing for twenty years and had won an Oscar. The film was another success for Kramer, who took on a unique subject dealing with a world few knew about. Critic Bosley Crowther noted that its &quot;striking and authentic documentary quality has been imported to the whole film in every detail, attitude and word.&quot;

Zinnemann said he was impressed with Kramer&#x27;s company and the efficiency of their productions:
Also released in 1950 was Kramer&#x27;s production of &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, the first English language film version of Edmond Rostand&#x27;s 1897 French play. It made a star of José Ferrer, who won his only Oscar for Best Actor.

====Films with Columbia Pictures====
In 1951, Columbia Pictures president Harry Cohn offered Kramer&#x27;s company an opportunity to form a production unit working with his studio. Kramer was given free rein over what films he chose to make, along with a budget of nearly a million dollars each. Kramer agreed to a five-year contract during which time he would produce 20 films. However, Kramer later stated that the agreement was &quot;one of the most dangerous and foolhardy moves of my entire career.&quot; He agreed to the commitment because of his &quot;deep-seated desire to direct,&quot; he states, along with the security of ready studio financing.

His last independent production was &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952), a Western drama directed by Fred Zinnemann. The movie was well received, winning four Oscars, as well as three other nominations. Unfortunately, &quot;High Noon&quot;″s production and release intersected with McCarthyism. Writer, producer and partner Carl Foreman was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee while he was writing the film. Foreman had been a member of the Communist Party ten years earlier, but declined to &quot;name names&quot; and was branded an &quot;un-cooperative witness&quot; by HUAC, and then blacklisted by the Hollywood companies, after which he sold his interest in the company. Kramer, a long time friend and business partner of Carl Foreman removed Foreman&#x27;s name from the credits as co-producer.

Kramer continued producing movies at Columbia, including &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; (1951), &quot;The Sniper&quot; (1952), &quot;The Member of the Wedding&quot; (1952), &quot;The Juggler&quot; (1953), &quot;The Wild One&quot; (1953) and &quot;The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T&quot; (1953). With a larger budget, his films took on a &quot;glossier&quot; more polished look, yet his next 10 films all lost money, although some were nonetheless highly praised.

In 1953, Cohn and Kramer agreed to terminate the five-year, 20-film contract Kramer had signed. However, his last Columbia film, &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; (1954), regained all of the losses Columbia had incurred as a result of his earlier projects. &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; was an adaptation of the book written by Herman Wouk and was directed by Edward Dmytryk.

Kramer observed that during the 1940s and 1950s, &quot;cinema was the producer&#x27;s medium:&quot;
===Director===
After &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot;, Kramer left Columbia and resumed his independent productions, this time in the role of the director. Over the next two decades, Kramer reestablished his reputation within the film industry by directing a continual series of often successful films dealing with social and controversial issues, such as racism, nuclear war, greed and the causes and effects of fascism. Critic Charles Champlin later described Kramer as &quot;a guy who fought some hard battles. He took on social issues when it was not popular to do so in Hollywood.&quot;

Among some of those controversial films were &quot;Not as a Stranger&quot; (1955), &quot;The Pride and the Passion&quot; (1957), &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot; (1958), &quot;On the Beach&quot; (1959), &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; (1960), &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; (1961), and &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot; (1967). In addition to dramas, he directed &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963).

His first film as director was &quot;Not as a Stranger&quot; (1955), the story of medical students and their career, some of whom lose their idealism and succumb to blind ambition, adultery, and immoral behavior. The film was a &quot;smash hit,&quot; but reviews were mixed. Pauline Kael claimed it &quot;lacked rhythm and development.&quot;

====&quot;The Pride and the Passion&quot; (1957)====
&quot;The Pride and the Passion&quot; (1957) is an adaptation from &quot;The Gun&quot;, a novel by C. S. Forester. It portrays in detail how a dedicated group of Spanish guerrillas dragged a gigantic cannon across half the country in an effort to defeat Napoleon&#x27;s advancing army. It stars Frank Sinatra, Cary Grant and Sophia Loren.

====&quot;The Defiant Ones&quot; (1958)====
The following year, Kramer directed &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot; (1958), the story of two escaped convicts in the Deep South, one black, played by Sidney Poitier, and one white, Tony Curtis. To add to the intensity of the drama, both men are shackled together with chains, forcing them, despite their wishes, into a sense of brotherhood, suffering and fear.

&quot;New York Times&quot; film critic Bosley Crowther lauded the production and the acting in the film, calling it &quot;a remarkably apt and dramatic visualization of a social idea—the idea of men of different races brought together to face misfortune in a bond of brotherhood — is achieved by producer Stanley Kramer in his new film.&quot; It was nominated for eight Academy Awards, winning two.

Five years after the film was released, producer George Stevens Jr. helped organize a showing of this, along with other Kramer films, at the Moscow Film Festival, which Kramer and co-star Sidney Poitier attended. Stevens writes that the showings of his films, especially &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot;, were a &quot;great success in Moscow.&quot; He remembers that &quot;filmmakers applauded his films, often chanting &quot;Kraaaamer, Kraaaaamer, Kraaaaamer&quot;,&quot; at their conclusion. Kramer spoke to the audience after each film, &quot;making a fine impression for his country.&quot; Stevens credits &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot; for having the most impact, however:
====&quot;On the Beach&quot; (1959)====
With &quot;On the Beach&quot; (1959), Kramer tried to tackle the sensitive subject of nuclear war. The film takes place after World War III has annihilated most of the Northern hemisphere, with radioactive dust on a trajectory towards Australia. Kramer gave the film an &quot;effective and eerie&quot; documentary look at depopulated cities. It starred Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, Fred Astaire and Anthony Perkins.

Reviews were mostly positive, not just from critics but from scientists. Linus Pauling, winner of two Nobel Prizes (Chemistry and Peace), commented:
 Critics Arthur Knight and Hollis Alpert likewise praised the film and admired Kramer for showing &quot;courage in attempting such a theme.&quot;

====&quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; (1960)====
&quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; (1960) became Kramer&#x27;s next challenging film, this one taking on the highly charged subjects of creationism and evolution, and how they are taught in school. The film, an adaptation of the play of the same name, written by Jerome Lawrence and Robert Edwin Lee, was a fictionalized account of the 1925 Scopes Trial, which concerned a violation of Tennessee&#x27;s Butler Act. This law had made it unlawful to teach human evolution in any state-funded school in Tennessee. It starred Spencer Tracy, portraying the real Clarence Darrow, defending the teacher, and Fredric March as his rival attorney, William Jennings Bryan, who insisted that creationism was the only valid subject that should be taught to children. It was nominated for four Academy Awards.

For Tracy, who was nominated as Best Actor, the film became the first of four films he did for Kramer. &quot;Everybody tells me how good I am,&quot; he said, &quot;but only Stanley gives me work.&quot; The film received &quot;extravagant reviews,&quot; yet failed at the box office due to its poor distribution and advertising. In addition, fundamentalist groups labeled the film &quot;anti-God&quot; and called Kramer &quot;anti-Christ.&quot; Kramer, however, explains that these groups failed to understand the real theme of the film and the actual court trial it portrayed:
Kramer also notes that the film was the third part of a &quot;trilogy of what have been called by some &#x27;controversial pictures,&#x27;&quot; of which the first two were &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot; and &quot;On the Beach&quot;. &quot;I have attempted, and I hope succeeded in, making pictures that command attention,&quot; said Kramer.

====&quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; (1961)====

Like his previous film, &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot; (1961) was a fictionalized account of a real trial, this one about the Nuremberg Trials held after the defeat of the Nazis in World War II. It also starred Spencer Tracy as the leading judge, along with numerous other stars. Richard Widmark played the American military prosecutor, and Maximilian Schell played the defense attorney. The film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and won two: Schell as Best Actor and Abby Mann for Best Screenplay. Reviews were extremely positive. Critic Hollis Alpert wrote in his review:
 Similarly, Arthur Knight credited Kramer for the film&#x27;s significance: &quot;From first to last, the director is in command of his material. ...he has not only added hugely to his stature as a producer-director, but to the stature of the American film as well.&quot;

However, despite mostly rave reviews in the U.S. and many countries in Europe, biographer Spoto notes that during its various premieres overseas, &quot;it shocked many, angered some, disgusted others. But it bored no one.&quot; Kramer described its world premiere, in Berlin, as &quot;the most frightening evening in my life.&quot; It was attended by hundreds of dignitaries from throughout Germany.
William Shatner, who had a supporting role, recalls that prior to filming, Kramer and screenwriter Abby Mann required that everyone involved in the production, actors and crew alike, watch some films taken by American soldiers at the liberation of the concentration camps. &quot;They wanted us to understand what this film was about&quot;:
====&quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963)====
After the seriousness of his previous films, Kramer &quot;felt compelled to answer&quot; for the &quot;lack of lightness&quot; in his earlier films, writes Spoto. As a result, he directed &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963), a film with a &quot;gifted, wacky crew of comedians.&quot; Kramer describes it as a &quot;comedy about greed.&quot; According to one writer, he directed it &quot;to prove he could also handle comedy&quot; and hired many of the leading comedic actors of the previous decades, from silent star Buster Keaton to emerging talent Jonathan Winters. Winters later wrote that &quot;Kramer was a man who took chances—as they say, he worked without a net.&quot;

It played to mixed reviews with some criticizing its excessive comedy with too many comedians, thereby losing its focus. Nonetheless, it was Kramer&#x27;s biggest box office hit, and the public enjoyed its &quot;socially disruptive and goofy&quot; story and acting. Film critic Dwight Macdonald writes that its &quot;small army of actors—105 speaking roles—inflict mayhem on each other with cars, planes, explosives and other devices...is simply too much for the human eye and ear to respond to, let alone the funny bone,&quot; calling it &quot;hard-core slapstick.&quot; It was nominated for six Academy Awards, winning for Best Sound Editing.

====&quot;Ship of Fools&quot; (1965)====
&quot;Ship of Fools&quot; (1965) has been described as a &quot;floating &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;,&quot; an earlier film which also had an all-star cast. Its multi-strand narrative deals with the failing personal relationships among the passengers on board a passenger liner returning to Germany in 1933, during the rise of Nazism. Spoto describes its theme as one of &quot;conscious social and psychological significance.&quot; It won two Academy Awards and was nominated for six others.

Some writers describe the film as a &quot;microcosm&quot; displaying a &quot;weakness of the world that permitted the rise of Hitler.&quot; Kramer does not disagree, and wrote, &quot;Even though we never mention him [Hitler] in the picture, his ascendancy is an ever-present factor. Most of the passengers on the ship are Germans, returning to their fatherland at a time when millions of other Germans are looking for ways to escape.&quot; In a scene noted by Spoto, a Nazi passenger is &quot;barking inanities&quot; about how Germans should purify their race, to which a German-Jewish passenger responds, &quot;There are nearly a million Jews in Germany. What are they going to do — kill us all?&quot;

====&quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot; (1967)====
For his fourth film about the sensitive subject of racism, he both directed and produced &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot; (1967), a groundbreaking story about interracial marriage. It starred Spencer Tracy, Sidney Poitier, and Katharine Hepburn, winning two Academy Awards with eight nominations. It has been listed in the top 100 films over the last 100 years by the American Film Institute. However, despite its popularity with the public and its box-office success, many critics gave it negative reviews.

For Kramer and others involved in the production, it &quot;was one of the most important events of their lives,&quot; writes Spoto. Partly because it was the first film that touched the subject since the 1920s silent era. &quot;No one would touch this most explosive of social issues&quot; until Kramer took on the challenge. Co-star Sidney Poitier called the film &quot;revolutionary,&quot; and stated why:
The film was also important as it was the last film role for Spencer Tracy, who was aware while making the film that he was dying and did in fact die a few weeks after its completion. It was his fourth film directed by Kramer and his ninth with Hepburn, who was so shaken by Tracy&#x27;s death, that she refused to watch the film after it was completed. Kramer called Tracy &quot;the greatest actor I ever worked with.&quot;

As a result of this film&#x27;s commercial success, Kramer helped spur on Hollywood to reform its film marketing practices when it was observed that the film was doing excellent business everywhere in the U.S., including the Southern states where it was assumed that films with African American lead actors never would be accepted. As a result, the prominent presence of Black actors in films never again was considered a factor in Hollywood film marketing and distribution. However, Kramer, bothered by the film&#x27;s negative reviews and wanting respect as an important film artist like François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard, undertook a nine-college speaking tour to screen the film and discuss racial integration. The effort proved a dispiriting embarrassment for him with college students largely dismissing his film and preferring to discuss less conventional fare like &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; directed by Arthur Penn.

The film was Kramer&#x27;s last major success, and his subsequent films were not profitable, and many had mixed reviews. Among those films were &quot;The Secret of Santa Vittoria&quot; (1968), &quot;R.P.M.&quot; (1970), &quot;Bless the Beasts and Children&quot; (1971), &quot;Oklahoma Crude&quot; (1973), &quot;The Domino Principle&quot; (1977), and &quot;The Runner Stumbles&quot; (1979). &quot;Oklahoma Crude&quot; was entered into the 8th Moscow International Film Festival where Kramer won the Golden Prize for Direction. At the time of his retirement, he was attempting to bring a script titled &quot;Three Solitary Drinkers&quot; to the screen, a film about a trio of alcoholics that he hoped would be played by Sidney Poitier, Jack Lemmon, and Walter Matthau.

==Retirement and death==
In the 1980s, Kramer retired to Bellevue, Washington, and wrote a column on movies for &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; from 1980 to 1996. During this time, he hosted his own weekly movie show on then-independent television station KCPQ.

In 1986, he signed an agreement with Columbia Pictures to produce or direct two films, &quot;Chernobyl&quot; and &quot;Beirut&quot;, but the deal fell through when David Puttnam left Columbia. Three years later, he agreed to make &quot;ERN&quot; starring Robert Guillaume but the project stalled. In 1991, he signed a deal with Trimark to direct and produce &quot;Bubble Man&quot;, a project he had been working on since 1972, but it was not made.

In 1997, Kramer published his autobiography &quot;A Mad Mad Mad Mad World: A Life in Hollywood&quot;.

He died on February 19, 2001, in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, aged 87, after contracting pneumonia. He was married three times and divorced twice. He was survived by his third wife, actress Karen Sharpe, and four children: Casey (1955–2023) and Larry (with Anne Pearce), and Katharine and Jennifer (with Karen Sharpe).

==Legacy==
Kramer has been called &quot;a genuine original&quot; as a filmmaker. He made movies that he believed in, and &quot;straddled the fence between art and commerce for more than 30 years.&quot; Most of his films were noted for engaging the audience with political and social issues of the time. When asked why he gravitated to those kinds of themes, he stated, &quot;emotionally I am drawn to these subjects,&quot; and thought that independent productions like his might help &quot;return vitality to the motion picture industry...If our industry is to flourish, we must break away from formula thinking.&quot;

Film author Bill Nichols states that &quot;Kramer&#x27;s films continue a long-standing Hollywood tradition of marrying topical issues to dramatic form, a tradition in which we find many of Hollywood&#x27;s more openly progressive films.&quot; Among his themes, Kramer was one of the few filmmakers to delve into subjects relating to civil rights, and according to his wife, Karen Kramer, &quot;put his reputation and finances on the line to present subject matter that meant something.&quot; He gave up his salary to make sure that &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot; was completed. However, he has not had universally acclaim. Film critic David Thomson has written that Kramer&#x27;s &quot;films are middlebrow and overemphatic; at worst, they are among the most tedious and dispiriting productions the American cinema has to offer. Commercialism, of the most crass and confusing kind...devitalised all [of] his projects.&quot;

Critics have labeled Kramer&#x27;s films as &quot;message movies.&quot; Some, like Pauline Kael, were often critical of his subject matter for being &quot;melodramas,&quot; and &quot;irritatingly self-righteous,&quot; but she credits his films for their &quot;redeeming social importance...[with] situations and settings nevertheless excitingly modern, relevant.&quot; Kramer, however, saw himself as &quot;a storyteller with a point of view&quot;:
In the 1960s Kramer blamed the growing &quot;youth culture&quot; with having changed the &quot;artistic landscape&quot; as he remembered it from his own youth. &quot;No longer,&quot; he said, &quot;were writers or filmmakers interested in creating the Great American Novel or the great American film, or indeed with exploring what it meant to be American.&quot;

In extreme cases, Kramer was accused of being &quot;anti-American&quot; due to the themes of his films, many concerning social problems or pathologies. But Kramer notes that it was his ability to produce those films in a democracy which distinguishes them:
Kramer produced and directed 23 different actors in Oscar-nominated performances, with José Ferrer, Gary Cooper, Maximilian Schell and Katharine Hepburn winning for their performances. Kramer&#x27;s was among the first stars to be completed on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on March 28, 1960, out of the original 1,550 stars created and installed as a unit in 1960.

One of his daughters, Kat Kramer, is co-producer of socially relevant documentaries, as part of her series &quot;Films That Change the World&quot;.

<text>Ivonka Survilla (, born Iwonka Szymaniec, , April 11, 1936) is the President of the Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic, a Belarusian government in exile.

==Early life==
Ivonka Survilla was born Iwonka Szymaniec in Stowbtsy, then part of the Second Polish Republic (Western Belorussia), into the family of Uladzimier Šymaniec, an engineer, and Evelina Šymaniec (née Paškievič).

In 1940, after the Soviet annexation of Western Belorussia, Uladzimier Šymaniec was arrested by the Soviets and sentenced to five years imprisonment in the Gulag. He escaped due to the German invasion of the USSR.

In 1944 the family fled to the West through East Prussia with thousands of other refugees and eventually reached Denmark, where they lived in a refugee camp for several years. On the way Ivonka&#x27;s younger sister died.

In 1948 her family moved to France and settled in Paris. Šymaniec&#x27;s family members were active participants in the local Belarusian community. Šymaniec studied at Beaux-Arts de Paris and then graduated from a humanities faculty of the Sorbonne.

In 1959 Ivonka Šymaniec married , a Belarusian economist, activist and radio broadcaster. With him she moved to Madrid where they ran a Belarusian language radio program supported by Francoist Spain.

==In Canada==

After the closure of the radio station in 1965, Janka and Ivonka Survilla moved to Canada in 1969 where Ivonka started working as translator for the federal government. She eventually became the head of Translation Services at Health Canada.

In Canada, Ivonka Survilla became an active member of local Belarusian organisations.

In 1989, Ivonka Survilla, with the assistance of her husband Janka Survilla and friends Zinaida Gimpelevitch and Pauline Paszkievicz-Smith, created the Canadian Relief Fund for Chernobyl Victims in Belarus. This charitable organization has provided medical aid in various forms, reciprocal medical staff visits between Canada and Belarus, food aid, and has provided health respites for children in various locations within Canada.

==As president==

Ivonka Survilla was elected president of the Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic in 1997. She is the first woman president of the Rada and the first president elected after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and creation of an independent Republic of Belarus.

Survilla regularly addresses the Belarusian society on March 25 and other occasions.

She is a founding signatory of the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism.

In 2013 she was awarded the Canadian Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal for &quot;her lifelong work in restoring democracy to Belarus&quot;.

==Personal life==
Ivonka Survilla has two daughters. One of her daughters, Maria Paula Survilla, (1964–2020) was a professor of ethnomusicology at Wartburg College in Waverly, Iowa. Her husband Janka Survilla died in Ottawa in 1997.

<doc id="265252" wikidata="Q44620" url="?curid=265252" title="Franz Josef Strauss">
<text>Franz Josef Strauss ( ; 6 September 1915 – 3 October 1988) was a German politician. He was the long-time chairman of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) from 1961 until 1988, member of the federal cabinet in different positions between 1953 and 1969 and minister-president of the state of Bavaria from 1978 until 1988. Strauss is also credited as a co-founder of European aerospace conglomerate Airbus.

After the 1969 federal elections, West Germany&#x27;s CDU/CSU alliance found itself out of power for the first time since the founding of the Federal Republic. At this time, Strauss became more identified with the regional politics of Bavaria. While he ran for the chancellorship as the candidate of the CDU/CSU in 1980, for the rest of his life Strauss never again held federal office. From 1978 until his death in 1988, he was the head of the Bavarian government. His last two decades were marked by a fierce rivalry with CDU chairman Helmut Kohl.

==Early life==

Born in Munich on 6 September 1915, as the second child of a butcher, Strauss studied German letters, history and economics at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich from 1935 to 1939.

==World War II==

In World War II, he served in the Wehrmacht on the Western and Eastern Fronts. While on , he passed the German state exams to become a teacher. After suffering from severe frostbite on the Eastern Front in early 1943, he served as an &quot;Offizier für wehrgeistige Führung&quot;, responsible for the education of the troops, at the antiaircraft artillery school in Altenstadt Air Base, near Schongau. He held the rank of &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; at the end of the war.

==Early post-war years==

In 1945 he served as translator for the U.S. Army. He called himself &quot;Franz Strauß&quot; until soon after the war when he started using his middle name &quot;Josef&quot; as well.

==Political life 1945–1961==

After the war, in 1945, he was appointed deputy &quot;Landrat&quot; (chief executive and representative of the district) of Schongau by the American military government and was involved in founding the local party organization of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU). Strauss became a member of the first &quot;Bundestag&quot; (Federal Parliament) in 1949.

In 1953 Strauss became Federal Minister for Special Affairs in the second cabinet of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, in 1955 Federal Minister of Nuclear Energy, and in 1956 Defence Minister, charged with the build-up of the new West German defence forces, the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;the youngest man to hold this office at the time. He became chairman of the CSU in 1961.

Strauss stated in a letter to HIAG in March 1957: &quot;I think you know how I personally think about the front line units of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;. They are included in my admiration for the German soldiers of the last world war.&quot;

==Lockheed bribery scandals==

Former Lockheed lobbyist admitted to investigators during a U.S. Senate hearing that Minister of Defence Strauss and his party had received at least $10 million in remuneration for arranging West Germany&#x27;s purchase of 900 F-104G Starfighters in 1961, which later became part of the Lockheed bribery scandals. The party, its leaders, and Strauss all denied the allegations; and Strauss filed a slander suit against Hauser. Strauss and Hauser had met after World War II in Schongau, Bavaria, where Hauser was stationed. Hauser worked for U.S. Intelligence and Strauss was Hauser&#x27;s translator. They were good friends, which Strauss later denied, in a denial belied by the fact that Strauss had attended Hauser&#x27;s wedding. As the allegations were not corroborated, the issue was dropped. It was known at the time that a Senate hearing in the U.S. revealed that Lockheed associates paid Strauss a bribe to purchase the planes, due to Boeing suing Lockheed over the lost German business. In a Senate hearing in the U.S., it was admitted by Lockheed associates that the funds were disbursed to Strauss. In spite of this fact, Strauss was never indicted in Germany due to his influence. Lockheed at that time was on the brink of collapse; the German contract was key to the company&#x27;s survival. The F-104G&#x27;s development had been expensive; the U.S. Air Force refused to purchase the plane due to its unnecessary features. The German contract proved to be a windfall for Lockheed. After Germany ordered the fighter planes from Lockheed, many more European governments started to place their trust in the Starfighter and ordered more planes, saving Lockheed from financial ruin.

==&quot;Spiegel&quot; affair==

Strauss was forced to step down as defence minister in 1962 in the wake of the &quot;Spiegel&quot; affair. Rudolf Augstein, owner and editor-in-chief of the influential &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; magazine, published German defense information that Strauss&#x27;s department alleged was top secret. He was arrested on Strauss&#x27;s request and was held for 103 days. On 19 November, the five FDP ministers of the cabinet resigned, demanding that Strauss be fired. This put Chancellor Adenauer himself at risk. He found himself publicly accused of backing the suppression of a critical press with the resources of the state. Strauss had no choice but to admit that he had lied to the parliament, and was forced to resign. Strauss himself was exonerated by the courts on the charge of acting against the constitution.

==Rivalry between Kohl and Strauss==


Strauss was appointed minister of the treasury again in 1966, in the cabinet of Kurt Georg Kiesinger. In cooperation with the SPD minister for economy, Karl Schiller, he developed a groundbreaking economic stability policy; the two ministers, quite unlike in physical appearance and political background, were popularly dubbed &quot;&quot;, after two dogs in a 19th-century cartoon by Wilhelm Busch.

After the SPD was able to form a government without the conservatives, in 1969, Strauss became one of the most vocal critics of Willy Brandt&#x27;s &quot;Ostpolitik&quot;. After Helmut Kohl&#x27;s first run for chancellor in 1976 failed, Strauss cancelled the alliance between the CDU and CSU parties in the Bundestag, a decision which he only reversed months later when the CDU threatened to extend their party to Bavaria (where the CSU holds a political monopoly for the conservatives). In the 1980 federal election, the CDU/CSU opted to nominate Strauss as their candidate for chancellor. Strauss had continued to be critical of Kohl&#x27;s leadership, so providing Strauss a shot at the chancellery may have been seen as an endorsement of either Strauss&#x27; policies or style (or both) over Kohl&#x27;s. But many, if not most, observers at the time believed that the CDU had concluded that Helmut Schmidt&#x27;s SPD was likely unbeatable in 1980, and felt that they had nothing to lose in running Strauss. Schmidt&#x27;s victory was seen by Kohl&#x27;s supporters as a vindication of their man, and though the rivalry between Kohl and Strauss persisted for years, once the CDU/CSU was able to take power in 1982, it was Kohl who became chancellor. He remained in power well beyond Strauss&#x27;s death.

==European integration==

Strauss wrote a book called &quot;The Grand Design&quot;, in which he set forth his views of how the future unification of Europe might be achieved. He was part of the secret paneuropean conservative network Le Cercle that promoted his political career.

==Airbus==

As an aerospace enthusiast, Strauss was a key player in the creation of Airbus in the 1970s. He served as chairman of Airbus in the late 1980s, until his death in 1988; he saw the company win a lucrative but controversial (see Airbus affair) contract to supply planes to Air Canada just before his death. Munich&#x27;s new airport, the Franz Josef Strauß Airport, was named after him in 1992.

==Minister-President of Bavaria==
From 1978 until his death in 1988, Strauss was Minister-President of Bavaria, serving his rotation as president of the German Bundesrat in 1983–84. After his defeat in the 1980 federal election, he retreated to commenting on federal politics from Bavaria. In the following years, he was the most visible critic of Kohl&#x27;s politics in his own political camp, even after Kohl ascended to the chancellorship. In 1983, he was primarily responsible for a loan of 3 billion Deutsche Marks given to East Germany. This move, in violation of longtime CSU/CDU policy to allow the East German economy to collapse naturally, was widely criticised even during Strauss&#x27;s lifetime. The Republicans split from the CSU/CDU over this move.

Strauss was a strong Bavarian monarchist.

== Wackersdorf nuclear reprocessing plant (WAA) ==
Strauß campaigned vehemently for the construction of the Wackersdorf nuclear reprocessing plant (WAA) in Wackersdorf (Bavaria), which was accompanied by strong protests from the population, which he described as &quot;hardly more dangerous than a bicycle spoke factory&quot;.

The ecclesiastical resistance in particular, which met primarily at the Franziskus-Marterl, was a nuisance for Strauss and he explained that &quot;anyone who confuses people, whoever causes them to feel insecure, excited and afraid for no reason, is doing the work of the devil&quot;.

==Visit to Albania==

Strauss visited communist Albania on 21 August 1984, while Enver Hoxha, the ruler from the end of World War II until his death in 1985, was still in power. Strauss was one of the few Western leaders, if not the only one, to visit the isolationist Albania in decades. This fuelled speculation that Strauss might be preparing the way for diplomatic links between Albania and West Germany and, indeed, relations were established in 1987.

In 2017, Strauss was honored with the Albanian National Flag Order, while a city square holds his name in Tirana.

==Death==

On 1 October 1988, Strauss collapsed while out hunting with Johannes, 11th Prince of Thurn and Taxis, in the Thurn and Taxis forests, east of Regensburg. He died in a Regensburg hospital on 3 October without having regained consciousness. He was 73.

==Family==

Strauss married in 1957. She died in a car accident in 1984. They had three children: , , and Monika, who was member of the Landtag of Bavaria and a Bavarian minister. In 2009 she was elected to the European Parliament.

==Legacy==

Strauss shaped post-war Bavaria and polarized the public like few others. He was an articulate leader of conservatives and a skilled rhetorician. His outspoken right-leaning political standpoints made him an opponent of more moderate politicians and the entire political left. His association with several large-scale scandals made many politicians distance themselves from him. His policies contributed to changing Bavaria from an agrarian state to one of Germany&#x27;s leading industry centres, and one of the wealthiest regions of Germany.

According to British diplomat Richard Hiscocks:Strauss is without doubt one of the most remarkable personalities that has yet emerged in Germany since the war and, from a democratic point of view, the most dangerous…. he has great ambition and combines with it the advantages of considerable intellectual gifts, an exceptional memory, immense resilience and capacity for work, and the ability to make quick decisions...On the other hand, these positive qualities are offset by equally pronounced defects. The unscrupulousness of his political methods exceeds even Adenauer’s and is not counterbalanced, as with Adenauer, by good judgment and serenity of manner. Above all he is lacking in self-control and knowledge of men, and has the habit of picking weak and sycophantic companions...His quick decisions therefore have often been the wrong ones. Martin Walser once wrote of him, “He can defend us against everything, only not against himself.”

<text>The politics of Scotland () operate within the constitution of the United Kingdom, of which Scotland is a country. Scotland is a democracy, being represented in both the Scottish Parliament and the Parliament of the United Kingdom since the Scotland Act 1998. Most executive power is exercised by the Scottish Government, led by the first minister of Scotland, the head of government in a multi-party system. The judiciary of Scotland, dealing with Scots law, is independent of the legislature and the Scottish Government, and is headed by the Lord Advocate who is the principal legal adviser to the Scottish Government. Scots law is primarily determined by the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government shares limited executive powers, notably over reserved matters, with the Scotland Office, a British government department led by the Secretary of State for Scotland.

The Kingdom of Scotland entered a fiscal and political union with the Kingdom of England with the Acts of Union 1707, by which the Parliament of Scotland was abolished along with its English counterpart to form the Parliament of Great Britain, and from that time Scotland has been represented by members of the House of Commons in the Palace of Westminster. The Scottish Parliament was re–convened in 1999, as a result of the Scotland Act 1998 and the preceding 1997 Scottish devolution referendum, held under the Referendums (Scotland and Wales) Act 1997.

The issues of Scottish nationalism and Scottish independence are prominent political issues in the early 21st century. When the Scottish National Party formed a majority government after the 2011 Scottish Parliament election and passed the Scottish Independence Referendum Act 2013, the British parliament concluded the Edinburgh Agreement with the Scottish Government, enabling the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. The referendum was held on 18 September 2014, with 55.3% voting to stay in the United Kingdom and 44.7% voting for independence.

== History ==

===Kingdom of Scotland===

The unified kingdoms of Dál Riata, Cat, Cé, Fortriu, Fib, Strathclyde, Galloway, Northumbria and the Earldom of Orkney became the Kingdom of Scotland, an independent sovereign state which existed until the signing of the Treaty of Union in 1707 with the Kingdom of England. The unified Kingdom of Scotland retained some of the ritual aspects of Pictish and Scottish kingship. These can be seen in the elaborate ritual coronation at the Stone of Scone at Scone Abbey. While the Scottish monarchy in the Middle Ages was a largely itinerant institution, Scone remained one of its most important locations, with royal castles at Stirling and Perth becoming significant in the later Middle Ages before Edinburgh developed as a capital city in the second half of the 15th century.

The Crown was the most important element of government in the Kingdom of Scotland despite the many royal minorities. In the late Middle Ages, it saw much of the aggrandisement associated with the New Monarchs elsewhere in Europe. Theories of constitutional monarchy and resistance were articulated by Scots, particularly George Buchanan, in the 16th century, but James VI of Scotland advanced the theory of the divine right of kings, and these debates were restated in subsequent reigns and crises. The court remained at the centre of political life, and in the 16th century emerged as a major centre of display and artistic patronage, until it was effectively dissolved with the Union of the Crowns in 1603.

The Parliament of Scotland also emerged as a major legal institution, gaining an oversight of taxation and policy. By the end of the Middle Ages it was sitting almost every year, partly because of the frequent royal minorities and regencies of the period, which may have prevented it from being sidelined by the monarchy. In the early modern era, Parliament was also vital to the running of the country, providing laws and taxation, but it had fluctuating fortunes and was never as central to the national life as its counterpart in England.

===Treaty of Union===
 

The signing of the Treaty of Union in 1707 with the Kingdom of England ended both Scotland and England&#x27;s political independence, unifying both countries into a new state known as the Kingdom of Great Britain. The Parliament of Scotland, the Kingdom of Scotland&#x27;s legislature situated at Parliament House, Edinburgh, was merged with the Parliament of England to establish the new Parliament of Great Britain which would be based in London.

Following the ratification of the Treaty of Union, Parliament House became the seat of the Supreme Courts of Scotland in which it remains today. Under the terms of the Treaty of Union, various elements of independence from England was retained for Scotland, such as a separate education and legal system (including the Scottish court system – Court of Session and High Court of Justiciary) as was the countries church and religion. Additionally, the Crown of Scotland and the Honours of Scotland were to remain in Scotland, as were all parliamentary and other official records.

Until 1832, Scottish politics remained very much in the control of landowners in the country, and of small cliques of merchants in the burghs. Agitation against this position through the Friends of the People Society in the 1790s met with Lord Braxfield&#x27;s explicit repression on behalf of the landed interests. The Scottish Reform Act 1832 rearranged the constituencies and increased the electorate from under 5,000 to 65,000. The Representation of the People (Scotland) Act 1868 extended the electorate to 232,000 but with &quot;residential qualifications peculiar to Scotland&quot;. However, by 1885 around 50% of the male population had the vote, the secret ballot had become established, and the modern political era had started.

===Liberal and Labour Party dominance===

From 1885 to 1918 the Liberal Party almost totally dominated Scottish politics. Only in the general election of 1931 and the general election of 1955 did the Unionist Party, together with their National Liberal and Conservative Party (UK) allies, win a majority of votes.

Following the coupon election of 1918, 1922 saw the emergence of the Labour Party as a major force, and replacing the Liberals as one of the two dominant parties. Red Clydeside elected a number of Labour MPs. A Communist was elected for Motherwell in 1924, but in essence the 1920s saw a 3-way fight between Labour, the Liberals and the Unionists. The National Party of Scotland contested their first seat in 1929. It merged with the centre-right Scottish Party in 1934 to form the Scottish National Party, but the SNP remained a peripheral force until the watershed Hamilton by-election of 1967.

The Communists won West Fife in 1935 and again in 1945 (Willie Gallacher) and several Glasgow Labour MPs joined the Independent Labour Party in the 1930s, often defeating the official Labour candidates by wide margins.

The National Government won the vast majority of Scottish seats in 1931 and 1935. The Liberal Party, banished to the Highlands and Islands, no longer functioned as a significant force in central Scotland.

In 1945, the SNP saw its first MP (Robert McIntyre) elected at the Motherwell by-election, but had little success during the following decade. The ILP members rejoined the Labour Party, and Scotland now had in effect a two-party system.

=== Devolution ===


Devolution refers the process by which powers to legislate and govern are transferred from the UK Parliament in Westminster to a range of sub-UK level bodies, such as metro areas and the countries of the United Kingdom. Since the re–establishment of the Scottish Parliament, all matters have been devolved to that body by default, except those matters explicitly reserved to Westminster, and Westminster does not by convention legislate on devolved matters which are the responsibility of both the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government, except by consent.

In Scotland, matters devolved to the Scottish Parliament exclusively include justice and law, police and prisons, local government, health, education, housing and student support, social welfare, the economy, food safety and standards, planning policy, economic development, agriculture and rural affairs, culture, tourism, the arts and sport. A number of other matters are shared such as some elements of transport (the Scottish Government is responsible for the majority of Scotland&#x27;s transportation network), public pension and taxation. The Scottish Government receives a funding allocation from the UK Government, calculated under the Barnett Formula, but it does also have its own tax resources. 

Subsequently, the Scotland Acts of 2012 and 2016 transferred powers over some taxation including Income Tax, Land and Buildings Transaction Tax, Landfill Tax, Aggregates Levy and Air Departure Tax, drink driving limits, Scottish Parliament and local authority elections, some social security powers, the Crown Estate of Scotland, some aspects of the benefits system, some aspects of the energy network in Scotland including renewable energy, energy efficiency and onshore oil and gas licensing, some aspects of equality legislation in Scotland and gaming machine licensing.

The programmes of legislation enacted by the Scottish Parliament have seen the divergence in the provision of public services compared to the rest of the United Kingdom. While the costs of a university education, and care services for the elderly are free at point of use in Scotland, fees are paid in the rest of the UK. Scotland was the first country in the UK to ban smoking in public places, with the ban effective from 26 March 2006. Also, on 19 October 2017, the Scottish government announced that smacking children as punishment was to be banned in Scotland, the first nation of the UK to do so.

In a further divergence from the rest of the United Kingdom from 1 January 2021 all Scottish legislation will be legally required to keep in regulatory alignment in devolved competences with future European Union law following the end of the Brexit transition period which ended on 31 December 2020 after the Scottish Parliament passed the UK Withdrawal from the European Union (Continuity) (Scotland) Act 2020 despite the United Kingdom no longer being an EU member state.

===Future constitutional status===
 

A large debate in modern Scottish politics is over the constitutional status of Scotland. One common proposal is for the independence of Scotland from the UK; this would mean Scotland would once again become a sovereign state. There was an independence referendum in 2014 in which Scottish residents voted to remain within the United Kingdom, however this debate has been reignited due to the Brexit process, with the Scottish Government calling for a second independence referendum. This position is supported by the SNP and Scottish Greens, among other groupings. Independence advocates propose that independence would resolve a democratic deficit for Scottish voters and allow Scotland to rejoin the EU. Opponents argue that Scotland would be worse off economically after independence. 

In 2022, the Scottish Government under First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon launched the first paper in a series of independence prospectuses entitled &quot;Building a New Scotland&quot;. The publication is a series of papers published by the Scottish Government that seeks to lay out a prospectus for Scottish independence. The Scottish Government had previously proposed holding an independence referendum on 19 October 2023. On 7 September 2021, Nicola Sturgeon stated that she would resume the case for independence and restart work on a prospects for independence. On 13 June 2022, Nicola Sturgeon published the first independence paper. On 14 July 2022, Nicola Sturgeon published the second independence paper. As of March 2024, a total of ten papers had been published.

Other proposals include more devolution for Scotland, supported by the SNP in lieu of full independence. Under the pressure of growing support for Scottish independence, a policy of devolution had been advocated by all three GB-wide parties to some degree during their history (although Labour and the Conservatives have also at times opposed it). This question dominated the Scottish political scene in the latter half of the twentieth century with Labour leader John Smith describing the revival of a Scottish parliament as the &quot;settled will of the Scottish people&quot;.

===Timeline of significant events===
====1950s====
* 1950: The Liberals won two seats – Jo Grimond winning Orkney and Shetland. The Liberals continue to hold Orkney and Shetland to the present day.
* 1951: Labour and the Unionists won 35 seats each, the Liberals losing one seat.
* 1955: The Unionists won a majority of both seats and votes. They have not won a majority of seats at a general election in Scotland since. The SNP came second in Perth and Kinross.
* 1959: In contrast to England, Scotland swung to Labour, which scored four gains at the expense of the Unionists and winning 38 out of 71 seats in Scotland. This marked the start of 56 years of political domination of Scottish seats in the UK Parliament by Labour. This also marked the start of a trend which in less than 40 years saw the Unionists&#x27; Scottish representation at Westminster reduced to zero. The election was the last occasion when the Unionists won the popular vote in Scotland: their merger with the Conservative Party of England and Wales in 1965, to become the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party began a long, steady decline in their support.

====1960s====

* 1964: There was a substantial swing to Labour, giving them 44 of Scotland&#x27;s 71 seats. The Liberals won four seats, all in the Highlands. 
* 1965: David Steel won the Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles by-election for the Liberals.
* 1966: Labour gained 2 more seats and the Liberals made a net gain of 1. The SNP garnered over 100,000 votes and finished second in 3 constituencies.
* 1967: The SNP did well in the Glasgow Pollok by-election. Nonetheless, the Conservative and Unionist candidate won. However, in the subsequent Hamilton by-election Winnie Ewing won a decisive victory.

====1970s====

* 1970: The SNP performed poorly in local elections and in the Ayrshire South by-election. The general election saw a small swing to the Conservatives &amp; Unionists, but Labour won a majority of seats in Scotland. The SNP made little progress in central Scotland, but took votes from the Liberals in the Highlands and in north east Scotland, and won the Western Isles.
* 1971–73: The SNP did well in by-elections, Margo MacDonald winning Glasgow Govan.
* 1974: In the two general elections of 1974 (in February and October) the SNP won 7 and then 11 seats, their share of the vote rising from 11% in 1970 to 22% and then 30%. With the Labour Party winning the October 1974 election by a narrow margin of 3 seats, the SNP appeared in a strong position.
* 1974–79: Devolution dominated this period: the Labour government attempted to steer through devolution legislation, based on the recommendations of the Kilbrandon Commission, against strong opposition, not least from its own backbenchers. Finally a referendum, whilst producing a small majority in favour of an elected Scottish Assembly, failed to achieve a turnout of 40% of the total electorate, a condition set in the legislation. At the 1979 general election, the SNP fared poorly, falling to 17% of the vote and 2 seats. Labour did well in Scotland, but in the United Kingdom as a whole Margaret Thatcher led the Conservatives to a decisive victory, where Labour would spend the next 18 years in opposition.
* 1979–83: The SNP suffered severe splits as the result of the drop in support in 1979. Labour also was riven by internal strife as the Social Democratic Party split away. Despite this, the 1983 general election still saw Labour remain the majority party in Scotland, with a smaller swing to the Conservatives than in England. The SNP&#x27;s vote declined further, to 12%, although they won two seats.

====1980s and 1990s====
* 1987: The Labour Party did well in the 1987 general election, mainly at the expense of the Conservatives &amp; Unionists, who were reduced to their smallest number of Scottish seats since before World War I. The SNP made a small but significant advance.
* 1988: Jim Sillars wins the Glasgow Govan by-election for the SNP from Labour with 48.8% of the vote and a 3,554 lead over Labour.
* 1991: Nicol Stephen of the Liberal Democrats wins the 1991 Kincardine and Deeside by-election from the Conservatives, with 49.0% of the vote and a 7,824 lead over the Conservatives.
* 1992: This election proved a disappointment for Labour and the SNP in Scotland. The SNP went from 14% to 21% of the vote but won only 3 seats. The Conservative and Unionist vote did not collapse, as had been widely predicted, leading to claims that their resolutely anti-devolution stance had paid dividends.
* 1995: Roseanna Cunningham wins the 1995 Perth and Kinross by-election for the SNP from the Conservatives with 40.4% of the vote and a 7,311 vote lead over Labour.
* 1997: In common with England, there was a Labour landslide in Scotland. The SNP doubled their number of MPs to 6, but the Conservatives &amp; Unionists failed to win a single seat. Unlike 1979, Scottish voters delivered a decisive &quot;Yes&quot; vote in the referendum on establishing a Scottish Parliament.
* 1999: The Scottish Parliament was established. Labour take 56 seats, SNP 35, Conservative 18, Liberal Democrats 17, and Greens and Socialists one each. A coalition of Labour and Liberal Democrats led by Donald Dewar of Scottish Labour, took power.

====2000s====

* 2000: In October, Dewar died of a heart attack in office and was succeeded by Henry McLeish as Scottish First Minister.
* 2001: In November, McLeish stands down as First Minister following the Officegate financial scandal, and is succeeded by Jack McConnell.
* 2003: In the Scottish Parliament election, Labour take 50 seats, SNP 27, Conservative 18, Liberal Democrats 17, Greens 7, Socialists 6, Independents 3 and one from the Scottish Senior Citizens Unity Party. The Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition was maintained.
* 2006: Willie Rennie wins the 2006 Dunfermline and West Fife by-election for the Liberal Democrats from Labour with 35.8% of the vote and an 1,800 vote lead over Labour.
* 2007: The SNP became Scotland&#x27;s largest party in the 2007 Scottish Parliament election and formed a minority government. Alex Salmond succeeds Jack McConnell as First Minister. The SNP had 47 seats, Labour 46, Conservatives 17, Liberal Democrats 16, Greens 2 and Socialists, independents and other parties lost all their seats.
* 2008: John Mason wins the Glasgow East by-election for the SNP from Labour with 43.1% of the vote and a 365-vote lead over Labour.
* 2009: Willie Bain wins the Glasgow North East by-election for Labour from the Speaker with 59.4% of the vote and an 8,111 lead over the SNP.

====2010s====
* 2010: 2010 United Kingdom general election: Labour won 41 out of 59 Scottish seats and received over 1 million votes across Scotland, despite losing 91 seats across the UK as a whole.
* 2011: In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, the SNP become the first party to win an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament. The SNP won 69 seats, with 65 needed for a majority. Labour got 37, Conservatives 15, Liberal Democrats 5 and Greens 2. The Scottish leaders of Labour, the Conservatives, and the Liberal Democrats all resigned over the results.

* 2014: An independence referendum is held on whether Scotland should secede from the UK and become an independent country. Scotland votes to remain a part of the UK 55.3% to 44.7%. Alex Salmond resigns as First Minister, and is succeeded by Deputy First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon.
* 2015: At the general election, the SNP won 56 out of 59 Scottish seats, winning nearly exactly 50% of the popular vote. Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats won just a single seat each.
* 2016: In May&#x27;s 2016 Scottish Parliament election, the SNP lost their majority but remained the largest party and formed a minority government. The SNP got 63 seats, Conservatives 31, Labour 24, Greens 6 and Liberal Democrats 5. This was the first time Labour had finished third at any Scottish election since the 1918 general election.
* 2016: The UK votes to leave the European Union 51.9% to 48.1%, however 62% of Scottish voters backed remaining in the European Union.
* 2017: At the snap UK general election on 8 June, the SNP won 35 out of the 59 Scottish seats, the Conservatives won 13, Labour won 7 and the Liberal Democrats won 4 seats. This too was the first general election in 99 years where Labour finished in third place.
* 2019: At the 2019 UK general election, the SNP won 48 out of the 59 Scottish seats, the Conservatives won 6, the Liberal Democrats won 4 and Labour won a single seat. This was the worst result for Scottish Labour since the December 1910 general election, with Labour finishing in fourth place.

====2020s====

* 2021: At the 2021 Scottish Parliament election the SNP won 64 seats, Conservatives 31, Labour 22, Greens 8 (a week later lowered to 7 due to Alison Johnstone becoming Holyrood&#x27;s Presiding Officer, which requires one to give up their party affiliation), and the Liberal Democrats 4. The SNP signs a co-operation agreement with the Greens and the Liberal Democrat Leader Willie Rennie resigns.
* 2023: Michael Shanks wins the Rutherglen and Hamilton West by-election for Labour from the SNP with 58.6% of the vote and an 9,446 lead over the SNP.
* 2024: The Scottish Labour Party returns as the largest party representing Scottish constituencies at the House of Commons following the 2024 United Kingdom general election, winning 37 out of 57 seats. The Scottish National Party (SNP) fell to the second largest party by representation in the House of Commons, winning 9 Scottish seats whilst losing 39 seats.

==The Crown==

Scotland is governed under the framework of a constitutional monarchy. The head of state in Scotland is the British monarch, currently King Charles III (since 2022). Until the early 17th century, Scotland and England were entirely separate kingdoms ruled by different royal families. However, on the death of Elizabeth I of England in 1603, the then-King of Scotland James VI became James I of England, in what is known as the Union of the Crowns. However, the two monarchies remained legally separate, albeit held by the same individual.

Scotland is no longer an independent, sovereign country, nor is it a kingdom in its own right. Under the Union with England Act 1707, the Kingdoms of Scotland and England have been united into &quot;One Kingdom&quot; (Great Britain, later the United Kingdom). A unification of Scotland and England had been debated since the Union of the Crowns, however was initially met with little enthusiasm by the administrations of both countries.

The Crown of Scotland is still used during the monarchs first visit to Scotland following their coronation ceremony and is also present at the state opening of the Scottish Parliament alongside the remaining Honours of Scotland which the monarch attends.

==Legislature==

There are two bodies with the power to legislate for Scotland: the Scottish Parliament and the UK Parliament. Until 1999, the UK Parliament was the source of all legislation across the whole of the UK. Since then, devolution has meant that Scotland, as well as Wales and Northern Ireland, have had independent legislatures which pass laws on devolved responsibilities. The Scottish Parliament has had the power to pass primary legislation since 1999, and passed 282 Acts between then and the end of 2018. The Scottish Parliament can legislate on anything that is not reserved to the UK Parliament. The UK Parliament retains the ability to legislate on any matter for any part of the UK, including in Scotland, however since 1999 the UK Parliament has followed a convention (the Sewel convention) that means it will not normally legislate on devolved matters without the Scottish Parliament&#x27;s consent.

Opposition parties include the Scottish Conservatives (centre-right, conservative), Scottish Labour (centre-left, social democratic), the Scottish Liberal Democrats (centrist, social liberal), and the Scottish Greens (centre-left to left-wing, green). The Scottish Socialist Party (left-wing, democratic socialist) won a seat in the first Scottish Parliament election in 1999 and increased their number of seats to 6 in the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, but then lost their seats in the 2007 election and haven&#x27;t regained representation in the Scottish Parliament since. Elections were normally held once every four years from the inception of the Scottish Parliament in 1999 to 2016 (the election scheduled for 2015 was delayed for one year to 2016 after agreement by all of the main political parties). A Bill was passed by the Scottish Parliament on 25 February 2016 and received Royal Assent on 30 March 2016 increasing the term of the Parliament to five years. 73 Members are elected to represent constituencies, and the remaining 56 elected via a system of proportional representation. At Westminster, Scotland is represented by 44 MPs from the Scottish National Party, six from the Conservative Party, two from the Labour Party and four from the Liberal Democrats elected in the 2019 United Kingdom general election; as well as two MPs who were elected for SNP but have since defected to the Alba Party, and a further independent. The Secretary of State for Scotland—currently Alister Jack MP, a Scottish Conservative—is usually a member of the House of Commons representing a constituency in Scotland.

==Scottish Government==
 

Executive power in Scotland is exercised by the Sovereign (the Monarch). The Scottish Government is responsible for all devolved matters, including, but not limited to, education, transport, Scots law, Scottish Parliamentary and local government elections, health care, rural affairs, housing, the environment, taxation, the economy and local government, amongst other areas. The Government of the United Kingdom retains some limited powers of Scotland, as is responsible for reserved matters, such as deference, foreign policy and security. 

The reigning monarch formally appoints the first minister according to a nomination by the Scottish Parliament. The first minister leads the Scottish Government and appoints members to and chairs meetings of the Scottish Cabinet, which consists of Cabinet Secretaries, Junior Ministers, and Law Officers. The Scottish Government governs through Scottish statutory instruments, a type of subordinate legislation, and is responsible for the Directorates of the Scottish Government, the executive agencies of the Scottish Government, and the other public bodies of the Scottish Government. The directorates include the Scottish Exchequer, the Economy Directorates, the Health and Social Care Directorates, and the Education, Communities and Justice Directorates. Elected in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, the centre-left pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP) is the party which forms the devolved government; it currently holds a plurality of seats in the parliament (63 out of 129). 

In August 2021, the SNP and the Scottish Greens agreed terms which would see the Scottish Greens enter into a power sharing agreement with the SNP, known as the Bute House Agreement. The agreement would see the Scottish Greens form part of the Scottish Government. The Agreement details the way in which the Scottish Government and the Green Group in Parliament will work together, the appointment of Green ministers, excluded policy areas from the Agreement, confidence and supply and dispute resolution. The agreement is accompanied by a shared policy programme, which sets out in detail where the two have decided to collaborate. On 31 August 2021, the SNP and Scottish Greens entered a power-sharing arrangement which resulted in the appointment of two Green MSPs as junior ministers in the government, delivery of a shared policy platform, and Green support for the government on votes of confidence and supply. There was no agreement on oil and gas exploration, but the government now argued that it had a stronger case for a national independence referendum. First Minister Humza Yousaf formally ended the Bute House Agreement on 25 April 2024, effectively removing the Scottish Greens from government. He claimed that the Bute House Agreement &quot;had served its purpose&quot; and would lead a minority Scottish Government. As a consequence, Yousaf faced a vote of no confidence in the Scottish Parliament, and resigned on 7 May 2024 amidst the resulting government crisis. 

The first minister is conventionally the leader of the political party with the most support in the Scottish Parliament, currently John Swinney who was appointed in May 2024. Nicola Sturgeon, the previous first minister, led the government since November 2014. Before Sturgeon, Alex Salmond led the SNP to an overall majority victory in the May 2011 general election. The inaugural First Minister was Donald Dewar, the leader of Scottish Labour at the time, who was Secretary of State for Scotland at its time of establishment.

===International relations===

Scottish international relations and foreign affairs conducted by the Scottish Government seek to promote Scotland and Scottish interests overseas by promoting its culture, education and research, economy and promote Scotland as a place for trade and business. As of 2023, Scotland has a total of nine Scottish Government offices, with plans on opening a further office in Warsaw by the end of the current parliamentary term.

Thirty international offices of the Scottish Government currently operate in twenty countries globally. Scottish offices in other countries act as a mechanism to promote collaboration and engagement between the Scottish Government and other international governments.

==Scottish Parliament==


The Scottish Parliament is the national, unicameral legislature of Scotland. The election of a Labour government in the 1997 general election was followed by the Referendums (Scotland and Wales) Act 1997, which legislated for the 1997 Scottish devolution referendum, a referendum on establishing a devolved Scottish Parliament. 74.3% of voters agreed with the establishment of the Parliament and 63.5% agreed it should have tax-varying powers, which meant that it could adjust income taxes by up to 3%. The Parliament was then established by the Scotland Act 1998.

The Scottish Parliament sits in the Scottish Parliament Building at Holyrood in Edinburgh, giving it the informal name &quot;Holyrood&quot;. In the Scottish Parliament, the inhabitants of Scotland are represented by 129 members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs), who are elected by the additional member system, a form of proportional representation, by the Scottish Parliament constituencies and electoral regions. Thus the Parliament is unlike the UK Parliament, which is elected solely by the first past the post method. Of the 129 MSPs, 73 are elected to represent first past the post constituencies, whilst the remaining 56 are elected by the additional member system from eight regional lists. In the present parliament, elected in the 2021 Scottish Parliament elections, all MSPs are members of a political party and no independents.

It enacts primary legislation through Acts of the Scottish Parliament, but cannot legislate on reserved matters, as set out by the Scotland Act 1998 and amended by the Scotland Act 2012 and the Scotland Act 2016; these include defence, international relations, fiscal and economic policy, drugs law and broadcasting. Anything &quot;not&quot; mentioned as a specific reserved matter is automatically devolved to Scotland, including health, education, local government, Scots law and all other issues. This is one of the key differences between the successful Scotland Act 1998 and the failed Scotland Act 1978.

The Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament is the speaker of the parliament and the &quot;ex officio&quot; head of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body. The Presiding Officers of the Scottish Parliament have been: 

* David Steel (12 May 1999–7 May 2003)
* George Reid (7 May 2003–14 May 2007)
* Alex Fergusson (14 May 2007–11 May 2011)
* Tricia Marwick (11 May 2011–12 May 2016)
* Ken Macintosh (12 May 2016–13 May 2021)
* Alison Johnstone (13 May 2021–&quot;present&quot;)

== Scots Law and Judiciary ==


The Courts of Scotland administer justice in Scots law, the legal system in Scotland. The Lord Advocate is the chief legal officer of the Scottish Government and the Crown in Scotland for both civil and criminal matters for which Scottish Parliament has devolved responsibilities. The Lord Advocate is the chief public prosecutor for Scotland and all prosecutions on indictment are conducted by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, nominally in the Lord Advocate&#x27;s name. 

The Lord Advocate&#x27;s deputy, the Solicitor General for Scotland, advises the Scottish Government on legal matters. The Advocate General for Scotland advises the British Government, and leads the Office of the Advocate General for Scotland, a British government department. The High Court of Justiciary is the superior criminal court of Scotland. The Court of Session is the highest civil court and is both a court of first instance and a court of appeal. For judicial purposes, Scotland has been divided into six sheriffdoms with sheriff courts since the reform of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. Appeals from the Court of Session are made to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, which is also the final authority for constitutional affairs.

==Scotland in the United Kingdom==
 
===Secretary of State for Scotland===

Scotland is one of the four countries of the United Kingdom. Scottish reserved affairs (powers not controlled by the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government) are managed by the Secretary of State for Scotland, a role which aims to &quot;promote the best interests of Scotland within a stronger United Kingdom&quot; and represent Scottish interests within the UK government. However, the Secretary of State is normally appointed by the UK Government and is from the government parties, not necessarily from the major party in Scotland. The current Secretary of State for Scotland is Iain Murray who was appointed to the role in July 2024. 

Statutory instruments made by the UK Government – within which the Secretary of State for Scotland is a member of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom – may also apply to the whole of Great Britain. The Secretary of State for Scotland is appointed by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. This Secretary of State, who prior to devolution headed the system of government in Scotland, sits in the Cabinet of the United Kingdom and is responsible for the limited number of powers the office retains since devolution, as well as relations with other Whitehall Ministers who have power over reserved matters.

The Scotland Office is a department of the Government of the United Kingdom, responsible for reserved Scottish affairs. The Scotland Office, created in 1999, liaises with other Whitehall departments about reserved matters. Before devolution and the Scotland Office, much of the role of the devolved Scottish Government was undertaken by the Scottish Office, the previous British ministerial department led by Scottish Secretary.

===Parliament of the United Kingdom===
Scotland is represented by 57 MPs in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom elected from territory-based Scottish constituencies, out of a total of 650 MPs in the House of Commons. Various members of the House of Lords represent Scottish political parties.

The co-existence of devolution for Scotland and its continued representation in the UK Parliament, which retains full powers over matters relating to England, raised a debate known as the West Lothian question. This questions whether Scottish (and other devolved nation) representatives should continue to have a vote on affairs that do not relate directly to Scotland. This issue was exemplified in the raise in tuition fees in England in 2004. If non-English MPs, who were mostly government MPs, had not been able to vote, then the tuition fee rise would not have been able to occur, due to a rebellion on the government benches. This led to the creation in 2015 of the English votes for English laws (EVEL) process, in which Scottish MPs were not included in parts of the lawmaking process for laws that did not apply in Scotland. EVEL was abolished 2021.

==== Scottish representation in the Commons ====



For UK general elections, Scotland is divided into 59 constituencies of broadly equal population by the Scottish Boundary Commission. Each constituency elects a single Member of Parliament (MP), who represents the constituency in the House of Commons alongside representatives from the other countries of the UK. There are 650 MPs in total. The leader of the party or coalition that makes a majority or plurality in the Commons is typically invited by the reigning monarch to become the Prime Minister and to form a government.

Since 1945, Scottish seats have altered the final result of a general election four times. Without Scottish seats: in 1964, the Conservatives would have been the largest party rather than Labour; in February 1974, the Conservatives would have been the largest party but without a majority rather than Labour; in October 1974, Labour would no longer have won its majority and in 2010, the Conservatives would have won an outright majority and would not have needed to form a coalition with the Liberal Democrats.

Until the 2005 general election, Scotland elected 72 MPs from 72 single-member constituencies to serve in the House of Commons. As this over-represented Scotland in comparison to the other parts of the UK, Clause 81 of the Scotland Act 1998 equalised the English and Scottish electoral quota. As a result, the Boundary Commission for Scotland&#x27;s recommendations were adopted, reducing Scottish representation in the House of Commons to 59 MPs with effect from the 2005 general election. The necessary amendment to the Scotland Act 1998, was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom as the Scottish Parliament (Constituencies) Act 2004.

As of the 2024, the current representation of Scottish seats in the Commons, according to party allegiance, is:

* Scottish Labour: 37
* Scottish National Party: 9
* Scottish Liberal Democrats: 6
* Scottish Conservatives: 5

James Thorne Erskine, 14th Earl of Mar and 16th Earl of Kellie, retired in 2017 having lost his seat as a hereditary peer in 1999 but regained it in 2000 as a life peer; Charles Lyell, 3rd Baron Lyell (former Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland) died the same year. One of the former Lords Advocate, Kenneth Cameron, Baron Cameron of Lochbroom, retired from the Lords in 2016, while another, Donald Mackay, Baron Mackay of Drumadoon died in 2018. Besides these 61 peers listed in 2015 are hereditary members of the Lords living outwith Scotland, but who have titles in the Peerage of Scotland, such as Margaret of Mar, 31st Countess of Mar, or Scottish titles in the peerages of Great Britain or of the United Kingdom.

Between the 1963 Act and the House of Lords Act 1999 the entire hereditary Peerage of Scotland was entitled to sit in the House of Lords, alongside those with titles in the peerages of England, of Ireland, of Great Britain, and of the UK.

==Local government==

For the purposes of local government in Scotland, the country has been divided into 32 council areas since the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994. Since the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which also abolished the shires of Scotland, the country has been subdivided into community councils. Though retained for statistical purposes, the civil parishes in Scotland were abolished for administrative purposes in the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929.

Local government in Scotland is organised into 32 unitary authorities. Each local authority is governed by a &quot;council&quot; consisting of elected councillors, who are elected every five years by registered voters in each of the council areas.

Scottish councils co-operate through, and are represented collectively by, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA).

There are currently 1,227 councillors in total, each paid a part-time salary for the undertaking of their duties. Each authority elects a Convener or Provost to chair meetings of the authority&#x27;s council and act as a figurehead for the area. The four main cities of Scotland, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee have a Lord Provost who is also, &quot;ex officio&quot;, Lord Lieutenant for that city.

There are in total 32 councils, the largest being the Glasgow City Council with more than 600,000 inhabitants, the smallest, Orkney Islands Council, with fewer than 20,000 people. See Subdivisions of Scotland for a list of the council areas.

The most recent local elections in Scotland were held in 2022 and the next local elections are scheduled for 2027.

===Community councils===

Community councils represent the interests of local people. Local authorities have a statutory duty to consult community councils on planning, development and other issues directly affecting that local community. However, the community council has no direct say in the delivery of services. In many areas they do not function at all, but some work very effectively at improving their local area.

==Political parties==
Scottish National Party (SNP): The current party forming the Scottish Government is the Scottish National Party (SNP), which won 64 of 129 seats available in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election and 44.2% of the vote, one more seat than in 2016. The SNP was formed in 1934 with the aim of restoring Scottish independence. They are broadly centre-left and are in the European social-democratic mould. They are the largest party in the Scottish Parliament and have formed the Scottish Government since the 2007 Scottish Parliament election.

Scottish Conservatives and Unionist Party: The Unionist Party was allied with the UK Conservative Party until 1965, when the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party was formed. The Conservatives then entered a long-term decline in Scotland, culminating in their failure to win any Scottish seats in the 1997 UK election. At the four subsequent UK elections (2001, 2005, 2010 and 2015) the Conservatives won only one Scottish seat. The party enjoyed a revival of fortunes in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, winning 31 seats and finishing in second place. In the 2021 Scottish Parliament elections, they got 22.8% of the vote, winning 31 seats again. The Conservatives are a centre-right party.

Scottish Labour Party: In the course of the twentieth century, Scottish Labour rose to prominence as Scotland&#x27;s main political force. The party was established to represent the interests of workers and trade unionists. From 1999 to 2007, they operated as the senior partners in a coalition Scottish Executive. They lost power in 2007 when the SNP won a plurality of seats and entered a period of dramatic decline, losing all but one of their seats in the 2015 UK election and falling to third place in the 2016 Scottish election. The 2017 UK election produced a mixed result for the party as it gained six seat and increased its vote by 2.8% but the party came in third behind the SNP and Scottish Conservatives. In the 2021 Scottish Parliament elections, they got 19.8% of the vote, winning 22 seats.

Liberal Democrats: The Scottish Liberal Democrats were the junior partners in the 1999 to 2007 coalition Scottish Executive. The party has lost much of its electoral presence in Scotland since the UK Liberal Democrats entered into a coalition government with the UK Conservative Party in 2010. In the 2015 UK election they were reduced from 12 seats to one seat, and since the 2016 Scottish Parliament election they have had the fifth highest number of MSPs (five), unchanged on 2011.In the 2021 Scottish Parliament elections, they got 6% of the vote, winning 4 seats.

Scottish Green Party: The Scottish Greens have won regional additional member seats in every Scottish Parliament election, as a result of the proportional representation electoral system. They won one MSP in 1999, increased their total to seven at the 2003 election but saw this drop back to two at the 2007 election. They retained two seats at the 2011 election, then increased this total to six in the 2016 election. In the 2021 Scottish Parliament election they increased their representation by two seats to a total of eight members of the Scottish Parliament, however this was lowered to 7 a week later after Alison Johnson became Holyrood&#x27;s Presiding Officer, a neutral role meaning she had to give up her position as a Green MSP). The Greens support Scottish independence and Scottish republicanism, and in 2021, entered into a power sharing agreement with the Scottish National Party. Known as the Bute House Agreement, it was agreed in August 2021 to support the Third Sturgeon government, and saw two Scottish Green politicians appointed to junior ministerial posts within the Scottish Government. First was the first time any Green politician had served in government in Scotland and across the United Kingdom. The Scottish Greens left the Scottish Government on 25 April 2024, following First Minister Humza Yousaf&#x27;s announcement of the ending of the Bute House Agreement &quot;with immediate effect&quot;. The Scottish Green Party later confirmed it would &quot;vote to oust&quot; Yousaf as First Minister.

<text>OTTER (Organized Techniques for Theorem-proving and Effective Research) is an automated theorem prover developed by William McCune at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. Otter was the first widely distributed, high-performance theorem prover for first-order logic, and it pioneered a number of important implementation techniques. &quot;Otter&quot; is an acronym for &quot;Organized Techniques for Theorem-proving and Effective Research&quot;.

==Description==

Otter is based on resolution and paramodulation, constrained by term orderings similar to those in the superposition calculus. The prover also supports positive and negative hyperresolution and a set-of-support strategy. Proof search is based on saturation using a version of the given-clause algorithm, and is controlled by several heuristics. There also are meta-heuristics determining search parameters automatically. Otter also pioneered the use of efficient term indexing techniques to speed up the search for inference partners in large clause sets.

Otter has been very stable for a number of years but is no longer actively developed. As of November 2008, the last changelog entry was dated 14 September 2004. A successor to Otter is Prover9.

<text>E is a high-performance theorem prover for full first-order logic with equality. It is based on the equational superposition calculus and uses a purely equational paradigm. It has been integrated into other theorem provers and it has been among the best-placed systems in several theorem proving competitions. E is developed by Stephan Schulz, originally in the &quot;Automated Reasoning Group&quot; at TU Munich, now at Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University Stuttgart.

==System==
The system is based on the equational superposition calculus. In contrast to most other current provers, the implementation actually uses a purely equational paradigm, and simulates non-equational inferences via appropriate equality inferences. Significant innovations include shared term rewriting (where many possible equational simplifications are carried out in a single operation), several efficient term indexing data structures for speeding up inferences, advanced inference literal selection strategies, and various uses of machine learning techniques to improve the search behaviour. Since version 2.0, E supports many-sorted logic.

E is implemented in C and portable to most UNIX variants and the Cygwin environment. It is available under the GNU GPL.

==Competitions==
The prover has consistently performed well in the CADE ATP System Competition, winning the CNF/MIX category in 2000 and finishing among the top systems ever since. In 2008 it came in second place. In 2009 it won second place in the FOF (full first order logic) and UEQ (unit equational logic) categories and third place (after two versions of Vampire) in CNF (clausal logic). It repeated the performance in FOF and CNF in 2010, and won a special award as &quot;overall best&quot; system. In the 2011 CASC-23 E won the CNF division and achieved second places in UEQ and LTB.

==Applications==
E has been integrated into several other theorem provers. It is, with Vampire, SPASS, CVC4, and Z3, at the core of Isabelle&#x27;s &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; strategy. E also is the reasoning engine in SInE and LEO-II and used as the clausification system for iProver.

Applications of E include reasoning on large ontologies, software verification, and software certification.

<text>Bruce Hunter (born 1952) is a Canadian poet, fiction and non-fiction author.

==Biography==
Bruce Hunter was born in Calgary, Alberta. He is the author of ten books, seven of them poetry, as well as a collection of linked short stories and a novel. In 2010, his seventh book, &quot;Two O&#x27;Clock Creek - Poems New and Selected&quot; won the Acorn-Plantos Peoples&#x27; Poetry Award.

In 2009, Bruce&#x27;s novel, &quot;In the Bear&#x27;s House&quot;, won the Canadian Rockies prize selected from over 100 books from 10 countries at the Banff Mountain Book Festival.

His poetry collection &quot;Coming Home From Home&quot; (2000), was short-listed for the 1997 CBC/Saturday Night literary competition and selected as one of the top ten People&#x27;s Choice poetry books of 2000. His linked story collection, &quot;Country Music Country&quot;, was published in 1996 to critical acclaim and broadcast on CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Between the Covers&quot;. Wayson Choy said in &quot;Saturday Night&quot;: &quot;Bruce Hunter writes with bold restraint and a poet&#x27;s sensibility. His blue collar characters walk the tight line of their lives into the common universe that includes us all.&quot;

In 2017, Bruce was Author in Residence at Calgary Public Library and in 2007, he was Writer in Residence at the Richmond Hill Public Library, in the Greater Toronto Region; in 2002, he was Writer in Residence at the Banff Centre for the Writers&#x27; Guild of Alberta.

Bruce was deafened as an infant and was affected by low vision most of his adult life. He worked for 15 years as a gardener, labourer, equipment operator, and Zamboni driver before returning to school in his late twenties. While working those jobs, his poetry won him a scholarship to study creative writing at the Banff School of Fine Arts with W.O. Mitchell. Bruce went on to study film and literature at York University, graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts (Honours).

From 1986 to 2012, Bruce taught English and Liberal Studies at Seneca College. In the 1980s, for four years he was poetry and poetry reviews editor and columnist for Toronto-based Cross Canada Writers&#x27; Quarterly. He has also taught creative writing at the Banff Centre and York University.

Bruce retired from teaching in 2012, and writes full-time in addition to hosting readings and workshops on creativity and disability. He is a long-time member of the Canadian Hearing Society, the Canadian Hard of Hearing Association, the Canadian National Institute for the Blind, the League of Canadian Poets, the Writers&#x27; Guild of Alberta, the Writers&#x27; Union of Canada, and the Sierra Club of Canada.
