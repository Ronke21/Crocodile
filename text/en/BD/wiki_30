<doc id="260288" wikidata="Q1077459" url="?curid=260288" title="Colombo Plan">
<text>The Colombo Plan is a regional intergovernmental organization that began operations on 1 July 1951. The organization was conceived at an international conference, The Commonwealth Conference on Foreign Affairs held in Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in January 1950, and was attended by the finance ministers of Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, Ceylon, Pakistan and New Zealand, and the prime ministers of Ceylon and India. Membership has expanded significantly over the years to the current 28 governments.

The primary focus of its work is on the development of human resources in the south and southeast regions of Asia. Aid to education 1950 to 1983 came to $72 billion, of which $41 billion came from the United States.

== Host country of the Colombo Plan ==
The Colombo Plan enjoys a host country agreement with the Government of Sri Lanka in the form of a memorandum of understanding with privileges and immunities that are afforded by the Government of Sri Lanka.

In a speech made in Colombo on 5 July 2010, the 4th Secretary-General Dato&#x27; Patricia Yoon-Moi Chia said: &quot;The gearing up of the level of our activities is made possible through the voluntary contributions of member countries and international agencies such as OPEC fund. Last year our programming was over US$10 million and we expect a more than US$12 million programming this year with almost another US$2 million in terms of cost-sharing from our member countries. With funding from the United States Government and 13 other member countries, the Colombo Plan is now the biggest stakeholder in drug demand reduction in the Asia-Pacific, with a special initiative in Afghanistan.&quot;

==Programmes==
The Colombo Plan has four programmes:
*Drug Advisory Programme (DAP, estd: 1973) 
*Gender Affairs Programme (GAP, estd: 2014)
*Programme for Environment &amp; Climate Change (ENV, estd: 2016)
*Capacity Building Programme (CBP)

==Past Programmes==
*Long-Term Scholarships Programme (LTSP, estd: 1951) 
*Programme for Private Sector Development (PPSD, estd: 1995)
*Programme for Public Administration &amp; Environment (PPA, estd: 1995)

==The Plan now==
Over the years, while adhering to the concept of human resource development and South-South Cooperation in addressing issues of economic and social development, the programme content of the Colombo Plan has been changing to take account of the needs of member countries in a fast changing world economic environment. In the early years, the training programmes were more of a long-term nature, while recent programmes have been focusing on providing advanced skills and experience sharing aimed at arriving at the best practices in different fields of economic and social activities as a means of good policy making and governance. The current programmes of the Colombo Plan are in the areas of public policy formulation in an environment of globalisation and market economy, private sector development as a prime mover for growth, drug use and dependence prevention and treatment in member countries and addressing gender issues. The Colombo Plan Staff College for Technician Education located in Manila also provides skill development opportunities for technicians in middle level.

In her 2010 speech, Dato&#x27; Patricia Yoon-Moi Chia states: &quot;The current Colombo Plan looks very different since our restructuring and revitalisation in 1995. As we continue to build upon our past successes, the new Colombo Plan uses cooperation among developing member countries or South-south Cooperation between the developed member countries and developing member countries, to underpin all our activities. Since our restructuring in 1995, we have now provided 16,082 scholarships to 23 member countries for both long-term and short-term training programmes.&quot;

==Past secretaries-general==
The Colombo Plan underwent an organisational transformation and renewal in 1995, and the Colombo Plan Bureau became the Colombo Plan Secretariat to be headed by the Secretary-General, instead of a Director. The first Secretary-General was Dr. Kim Hak-su from Korea (January 1995 – March 1999) who was succeeded by Dr. Sarat Chandran, India (April 1999 – June 2003), Mr. Kittipan Kanjanapitkul from Thailand (June 2003 – August 2007), Dato&#x27; Patricia Yoon-Moi Chia from Malaysia (August 2007 – August 2011), the first Asian woman to hold this position, Mr. Adam Maniku from Maldives (15 August 2011 – November 2013), Mr. Kinley Dorji from Bhutan (May 2014 – April 2018) and, Ambassador Phan Kieu Thu (May 2018 - December 2021). The incumbent Secretary-General, Dr. Benjamin P. Reyes from The Philippines assumed duties on 1 May 2022 as the organisation&#x27;s 8th Secretary-General.

==Early criticism==
The Plan has been criticised on various grounds. Some Asians see in it only the hand of British imperialism, especially as it is not aimed at developing national self-sufficiency. It offers an almost exclusively economic solution for problems which are also political and social. Dangerous issues such as landlordism and the organisation of labour, which invite Communist exploitation, are barely touched on, doubtless because it seemed politically inexpedient to raise such questions.

==Present members==
The Colombo Plan currently has 28 members.
==Past members==
There have been four past members of the Colombo Plan including two founding members in 1950, Canada and the United Kingdom. South Vietnam and Cambodia joined together in 1951. On 2 Jul 1976 South Vietnam was succeeded by the Socialist Republic of Vietnam which withdrew in 1978. Vietnam was a provisional member from 5 Nov 2001 to 18 Nov 2003 until it was accepted as a full member in 2004.

<text>Cumberland is a city in Barron County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 2,274 at the 2020 census. The city is located partially within the Town of Cumberland. It was incorporated in 1885.

==History==
Cumberland is often called the &quot;Island City&quot;. The main part of the city, including the original settlement, is located on land surrounded by Beaver Dam Lake, originally settled by the Chippewa Indian tribe. Beaver Dam Lake was referred to as Che-wa-cum-ma-towangok or &quot;Lake Made by the Beavers&quot; by the local tribe. The Chief of the Chippewa tribe was Pon-gee Rau-gen, or &quot;Little Pipe&quot;. He continued to live in the area even after it was settled by European settlers, and drowned in a canoe on Beaver Dam Lake in 1895.

In 1874, A. Ritan and R. H. Clothier explored the area with the intention of settling in there. While exploring, they came across surveyors who informed them of the upcoming railroad line that the North Wisconsin Railway Company planned to lay in the area. A. Ritan, who lived near what is today Turtle Lake, and the Dahlby family, originally of Norwegian descent, from the town of New Richmond, both filed a homestead near the proposed railroad and built two log cabins 300 feet north of the present high school location.

In 1878, the North Wisconsin Railroad Company extended the rail lines through the area. Prior to the railroad, settlers were required to get provisions in Rice Lake, Barron or Clayton. In 1880, the Dahlby family sold their cabin, moved to Chandler (now known as Spooner), and opened a store. A. Ritan, also originally from Norway, lived in Cumberland for many years and helped develop the city before moving to Portland, Oregon. 
R. H. Clothier also took a homestead and built a farm in 1875.

On December 30, 1875, the town of Lakeside was organized, encompassing what is now Lakeland Township, Almena Township, Crystal Lake Township and Maple Plain Township. During the winter of 1876, Bonett Bridge was built off the island. Soon a school was located on the mainland area near the bridge with Miss Ida Schofield as the original teacher. She was soon replaced by Miss Carrie Fay, who arrived from nearby Prairie Farm. On January 1, 1880, the name was changed to Cumberland at the request of John Humbird, who arrived in the area from Cumberland, Maryland. Almena Township joined the Turtle Lake Township a couple of months later, and on November 12, 1902, Crystal Lake became its own township. In early 1876 a post office, originally called Lakeland, was established three miles east of the city, with L.I. Gunderson as postmaster. On September 10, 1876, Mae Jenet Hodgkin became the first white person born on the island. The first grocery store was opened by David Ingle, and Elmer Wisner of Clear Lake opened the first blacksmith shop in 1878. In the winter of 1879 the name was changed to Cumberland. In July 1880, Dr. William Hopkins arrived from Maine and set up a practice. At the time, it was the only practice between Clear Lake, Wisconsin and Lake Superior. Also around this time, a steam sawmill was set up in northern Cumberland, in what is now the &quot;Mill Hill&quot; area and operated for a few years until it was destroyed by fire on August 15, 1884. The Lakeside Cemetery was established in 1880. In 1881, the first newspaper, the &quot;Cumberland Herald&quot; (later the &quot;Cumberland Advocate&quot;) began printing. The first bank, the Bank of Cumberland, began operation on October 8, 1883. After the railroad begin to operate, settlers quickly arrived in the area, and by 1884 there were 24 saloons located in the area. In 1885 a jail and fire department, with N. D. Richards as Fire Chief, were established. By the late 1880s the first hotel was kept by Jack Collingwood, followed by several other hotels. Soon the Elm Street Bridge was completed and the fire department moved from its Lake Street location to its present location. In February 1893, the state board of health sent a representative to set up a quarantine on the Italian settlement due to unsanitary conditions. On August 1, 1884 the city borrowed $5,900 via bond issue to establish a system of waterworks which was constructed by Fairbanks, Morse and Company in February 1895. In April of the same year, telephone lines were also erected in the city limits. On September 14, 1895, the newly built water tank burst and damaged several nearby properties. On November 20, 1897 the city approved a resolution for street lighting of all public grounds by electricity. In 1903 the Uecke&#x27;s Opera House was opened. The same year, a large school was constructed on the island on the present location of the Cumberland Elementary School. On March 15, 1905, a $10,000 donation from Andrew Carnegie established a Carnegie Library in Cumberland. In 1914 the Island City Hospital was created by Dr. George Grinde and included a 20-bed hospital and X-ray facilities.

<text>Rice Lake is a city in Barron County in northwest Wisconsin, United States, on the shore of the lake with the same name. The city is a commercial and tourist center for the surrounding rural areas. As of the 2020 census, the city had a total population of 9,040. The city is located mostly within the Town of Rice Lake.

==History==
American Indians lived around Rice Lake for millennia, some of whom made mounds like those that remain in Indian Mounds Park along the shore of the lake. In later years before white settlers, Ojibwe (Chippewa) people occupied the area, and they had a strong cultural attachment to the wild rice that grew on the lake.

In the mid-1860s Knapp, Stout &amp; Co., the growing lumber company downstream at Menomonie, bought tracts of forest around Rice Lake. Around 1868 the company started a logging camp in the area and in 1870 the company dammed the Red Cedar to raise the level of Rice Lake to make a better holding pond for their logs. The higher water disrupted the existing wild rice beds, angering the Ojibwe. As compensation, Knapp-Stout gave them food, but it was settlers&#x27; food like pork and flour - not wild rice.

Knapp-Stout platted the village in 1870, naming it for the lake, and naming many streets after officers of the company, including Knapp, Stout, Tainter and Wilson. The company built a small water-powered sawmill for sawing local lumber and a gristmill. Permanent settlers began arriving about that time. The first houses were built around 1874. Saloons and hotels followed. Rice Lake&#x27;s first school opened in a Knapp-Stout building in 1874. Regular mail service began that year, with the mail arriving by stage from Menomonie and Chippewa Falls, initially once a week. The first newspaper, the &quot;Chronotype&quot;, started the same year.

Many employees of the early Knapp-Stout were Norwegian and in 1875 a Norwegian Lutheran congregation was organized. A local brewery was also started in 1875. Episcopalian families began worshiping intermittently in 1879. Roman Catholics began meeting the following year, building a church the same year - the first brick building in the village. Knapp-Stout added a flour mill in 1879. A Methodist Episcopal congregation also formed in 1880, and a Presbyterian congregation in 1882.

In 1882 the first railroad reached Rice Lake - the Chippewa Falls and Northern Railroad, and the four-year high school was started. The following year the first bank opened - the Barron County Bank. A barrel factory opened in 1885, employing 40 men, and a hub and spoke factory in 1886, employing 50 in summer and 125 during logging season. In 1887 the Rice Lake Lumber Company opened, owned by Orrin Henry Ingram of Eau Claire. It expanded Knapp-Stout&#x27;s sawmill, added two planing mills, and employed 200.

Rice Lake incorporated as a city in 1887. A volunteer fire department was formed in 1889, which was equipped with a hook and ladder wagon, a hand hose cart, and 1,300 feet of hose. The city&#x27;s population was 2,130 in the 1890 census. A city library opened in 1897. The lumber companies set up electric lights and a water utility in 1892, which were taken over by the city in 1910.

In 1907 the Barron County Normal School opened. In 1938 WJMC, the area&#x27;s first radio station, began broadcasting. In 1940 the forerunner of Indianhead Tech College was established. In 1966 UW-Stout opened a branch campus in Barron County, which has since developed into UW-Eau Claire - Barron County.

<text>The National Youth Rights Association (NYRA) is an American youth-led Civil and political rights organization promoting youth rights, with approximately 10,000 members. NYRA promotes the lessening or removing of various legal restrictions that are imposed on young people but not adults, for example, the drinking age, voting age, and the imposition of youth curfew laws.

== Youth rights movement ==
The youth rights movement first utilized the Internet in 1991, with the creation of the Y-Rights listserv mailing list. Two members of that original Internet presence, Matthew Walcoff and Matt Herman, began a non-profit organization out of that mailing list known as ASFAR. Not too long after ASFAR was founded, a Rockville, Maryland high school student began a youth rights group called YouthSpeak. At the same time, the third youth from Canada, Joshua Gilbert, was starting a youth rights organization for his country, the Canadian Youth Rights Association (CYRA). Walcoff, Herman, Hein, and Gilbert all met through ASFAR, and decided to start a non-profit corporation to help unify the youth rights movement, which at that point consisted of almost a dozen different groups around North America and the world.

== Forming NYRA ==
NYRA&#x27;s Executive Director from 2000 to 2012 was Alex Koroknay-Palicz. As its key spokesman, he was featured on CNN, Fox News, PBS, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, as well as many others, on youth rights issues such as the voting and drinking ages. In 2012, Koroknay-Palicz stepped down before reemerging in 2015.

2005 was a significant year for NYRA. In late March, Koroknay-Palicz and several NYRA members traveled to Vermont in support of a bill lowering the drinking age to 18. They visited numerous colleges and signed up over 2000 new supporters. They participated in a debate at the Vermont state house, and the event was significantly covered by the media. Meanwhile, in Washington state, a new chapter in Olympia, Washington, testified in support of a state constitutional amendment to lower the state&#x27;s voting age to sixteen. From February to August 2006, President Adam King led a local campaign to add a nonvoting student adviser onto the Buncombe County (N.C.) Board of Education. His project had the support of the &quot;Asheville Citizen-Times&quot; and over 60 faculty members and administrators at his high school. However, in August, the Board of Education rejected his proposal citing that they already had sufficient student input. During his campaign, King made several appearances in the media.

By 2006, NYRA&#x27;s main area of focus was expanding its local chapters. Chapters had increased fivefold between 2003 and 2006. In 2006, the Board of Directors formally established that chapters are separate legal entities. The chapter formation division saw a major restructure near the end of 2006. Previously, the division was divided into five regions with one person assigned to that region. However, the division&#x27;s management decided to utilize a national pool of representatives working with all intents throughout the nation. In December 2006, NYRA received its first substantial grant from the Babson Foundation. And in January 2007, it began renting an office from Common Cause in downtown Washington, D.C.

In 2008, the organizations changed its slogan from &quot;the last civil rights movement&quot;, in reference to the youth rights movement, to &quot;live free, start young.&quot;

In 2009, NYRA began to take prominent legal action and assert itself as a force for youth and students in jurisprudence. The organization filed its first joint amicus curiae brief in Safford v. Redding, a student rights case brought before the United States Supreme Court, its President published an opinion opposing the Barr et al. v. Lafon case in the award-winning University of Pittsburgh School of Law journal &quot;the Jurist&quot;, and a local chapter filed a lawsuit against the city of West Palm Beach, Florida, in an effort to repeal its curfew, a case which is still ongoing.

NYRA co-sponsored the First Annual National Youth Rights Day which occurred on April 14, 2010. Robert Epstein wrote The Young Person&#x27;s Bill of Rights for this event.

== Governance ==

NYRA is a 501(c)(3) organization registered as a nonprofit corporation in Maryland.

It is governed by Margin Zheng &amp; Ashawn Dabney-Small President &amp; Vice-President of NYRA.

Their family traveled across the Great Lakes from Buffalo, New York, until they reached Wrightstown in 1850. Lucien Wright and his father Hoel sold Otis of land to build a cabin of basswood boughs.

During the 1850s to 1860s, dense timber covered the land. This provided work for many, including the Day family. The family made 75 cents a load by making shingles by hand which were then hauled to De Pere by ox.

Charles West Day married Juliette Chase on July 3, 1860. They had seven children, but two died during infancy. Otis Day died on June 20, 1882. His wife died eight years later on May 7, 1890.

<text>Siren is a village in, and the county seat of, Burnett County in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 806 at the 2010 census. The village is surrounded by the Town of Siren.

==History==
The Ojibwe and the French fur traders were the principal inhabitants of the region in the early 1800s.

Swedish immigrants began settling in the area around what is now Siren in the 1880s. Many of them were members of the Evangelical Covenant Church. The first post office was built in 1895 about a mile west of its present location. The first postmaster was Charles F. Segerstrom, who had the post office in his home. His home was surrounded by lilacs, which are quite abundant in the area. Segerstrom applied with the postal department for a name for the place, choosing &quot;Syren&quot;, Swedish for &quot;lilac.&quot; Presumably the postal department thought this was a misspelling, for on the granted application they put down the spelling as &quot;Siren.&quot; In 1912, the town center was moved nearer to the Soo Line Railroad tracks, which had been extended north through the area to Superior, Wisconsin and Duluth, Minnesota. The tracks were later removed but the trail was left behind for recreational purposes. It is now known as the Gandy Dancer State Trail and is a popular route for hikers, bicyclists, and snowmobilers.

On June 18, 2001, an F3 tornado passed through Siren, inflicting severe damage. Three people died; 175 buildings were destroyed and many more damaged. Since then much of the town has been rebuilt with its architecture reflecting Siren&#x27;s history.

<text>Chilton is a city in and county seat of Calumet County in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 3,720 as of 2024. The city is partially within the Town of Chilton.

==History==
The first residents of Chilton were African-American former slave Moses Stanton and his Native-American wife, Catherine, who arrived in January 1845. The city formed around his saw mill and a grist mill a few years later.

The village was originally called Stantonville. John Marygold bought the place in 1852 and, according to legend, called it &quot;Chilington,&quot; referring to Chillington Hall in England. He sent a verbal message to have the name change recorded in Stockbridge, then the county seat. Because the middle &quot;ing&quot; in the name was accidentally omitted, the municipality was recorded as Chilton. 

An alternative explanation for the name is that it was a reference to one of two villages called Chilton near Oxford, England. Both are located on the edge of the Chiltern Hills, a limestone escarpment similar to the Niagara Escarpment near Chilton, Wisconsin. &quot;Chilt,&quot; when used in a place name in England, is thought to have derived from the Old English word for chalk or limestone (&quot;cealc&quot;), while &quot;ton&quot; derives from the Old English word for town (&quot;tun&quot;). Between 1838-1852, when John Marygold lived in England, all records of births, marriages and deaths of people named Marygold were concentrated around just three cities: Marygold&#x27;s hometown of Birmingham (18 records), Oxford (10 records), and London (7 records). Oxford being just 80 miles from Birmingham, it&#x27;s plausible that Marygold had family members there and knew of the two nearby Chiltons.

The county seat was changed to Chilton in December 1853 and the county&#x27;s first courthouse was built. Most Chilton residents in the 19th century had German heritage.

===Gravesville===
Chilton annexed the unincorporated community of Gravesville in the late twentieth century. Gravesville was founded 1849 by Leroy Graves and the community was named after him. By 1881, it was one of the largest communities in the county behind Chilton and Stockbridge. Gravesville had over 400 residents and it unsuccessfully vied for becoming the county seat. Graves built a sawmill in 1849 which remained in the community until he moved it to Fond du Lac in 1886. At its peak, the community had several general stores, a furniture factory, and a saw/planing mill. It also had a post office (as of 1876).

<text>New Holstein is a city in Calumet County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 3,098 as of the 2020 census. The city is located within the Town of New Holstein.

==History==
New Holstein is named after the German duchy of Holstein from which many early settlers emigrated. In 1848, 70 people from Hamburg, Germany emigrated to the New Holstein area, forming the basis of what would become the present city. Many settlers were intellectuals who feared an impending war as a result of competing claims to the territory. Settlers originally named the community Altona after Altona, Hamburg, Germany. As the amount of mail received in Altona increased, the United States Post Office wanted Altona to be renamed because the community&#x27;s name was too close to Altoona in western Wisconsin.

In the early years, settlers traveled for supplies to Calumetville, Wisconsin, a larger neighboring community. Wild game, such as passenger pigeons, was available for food.

The first settlers in the city were Charles Greening and two of his companions. Dr. Charles Bock arrived shortly afterwards. The first postmaster was Monsignor Puchner, a Roman Catholic priest. In 1849 the town was organized, with the first chairman being Greening, who was named county judge in 1855. Settlers continued arriving from Germany throughout the mid-nineteenth century. A drama troupe was organized in 1851.

Railroad service was planned at meetings in 1871. A depot was built and the railroad arrived in 1872. The railroad named the station &quot;New Holstein&quot; after the town. Mail then came to the community on trains instead of via the Pony Express. The first post office was built shortly after rail service started.

By 1881, the community comprised about 400 residents, all of whom were either Germans or of German descent. The village covered over one square mile. That year it had two public halls, three hotels, a fire insurance company, and a cemetery. New Holstein&#x27;s principal business was a flour mill. Near the railroad depot was a grain elevator owned by Herman Timm.

In 1900 the census reported a population of 569. New Holstein was incorporated as a village the following year. The first lights were installed in the city in 1912.

New Holstein became a city in April 1926. The first city council was: Mayor Edward Funke, City Clerk Harvey C. Hansen, City Council President Peter Hass, Aldermen Gilbert Hipke, Robert Schilling, Louie Schaar, Edgar Lange, W. W. Lauson, Henry Schmitt, and Harry C. Hass, Superintendent of Water Works Henry Aggen, Fire Chief Walter Mathes, Assessor Arthur Roehl, and City Attorney George M. Goggins.

The current mayor is Richard Snelson. The current chief of police is Eric Fisher. The current fire chief is Denis Mayer.

Colby, partner in the construction company that was building the railroad, and the son of the railroad&#x27;s financier Gardner L. Colby.

As early as 1962, the area was home to Colby-Abbotsford Airport, a private facility with a 2600 ft runway running northeast–southwest and the remnants of a shorter northwest–southeast runway. The airport remained in operation as late as 1988, but has since been abandoned.

Colby is the birthplace of Colby cheese. A historical marker in downtown Colby commemorates the development of Colby cheese by Joseph Steinwand in 1874.

<text>Thorp is a city in Clark County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,621 at the 2010 census. The city is located partially within the Town of Thorp and partially within the Town of Withee.

==Geography==

Thorp is located at (44.959792, -90.801061).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

==History==
The forest around Thorp was Ojibwe (Chippewa) territory in the decades before white settlers arrived. In the 1837 Treaty of St. Peters, the Ojibwe ceded Thorp and much of northern Wisconsin to the U.S. Around 1837 a sawmill and settlement began in Chippewa Falls to the west. In 1844 James O&#x27;Neill settled at Neillsville to the south. From 1847 to 1853 surveyors for the U.S. government marked off the section lines that would become Thorp and assessed timber and land quality.

The first settler near what would become Thorp was James Seneca Boardman, arriving in 1870 and building a log cabin for his family in what would become the Town of Withee. He made a little money by shaving shingles in the winter and hauling them by ox-sled 50 miles to Black River Falls, where he sold the shingles and returned with supplies. There were some Ojibwe families around, but that first year the Boardmans&#x27; nearest settler neighbors were ten miles away where Longwood is, and the nearest post office was in Greenwood.

Other settlers arrived soon. In 1871 D.R. Goodwin and George W. Richards settled in what is now the Town of Withee and Michael McCaffrey started a home within what are now the city limits of Thorp. They generally tried to clear land in the summer and made shingles or worked in logging camps in winter. James Boardman&#x27;s brother Ephraim arrived with his family in late 1872, and in the next few years they were joined by George Courter, Nelson Courter, William Buyatt, S.S. Warner, Zeph Worden, William Jerard and F.M. Futts.

In 1874 the community built a log schoolhouse. The teacher was Mrs. Almeda Edmunds from Black River Falls, and she boarded with the J.S. Boardmans. Also in 1874 B.J. Brown established a post office named Winnieoka four miles east of what would become Thorp. He also stocked some goods which he sold to the locals. The following year, 1875, E.A. Boardman started selling some provisions hauled from Colby in what would become Thorp.

In 1876 the county board established the township of Thorp. E.A. Boardman was elected chairman. The 29 voters also agreed on some taxes: $1000 for improving roads, $300 for bridges, $25 for the school fund. They also agreed to split the children into two school districts. That year the school district built a frame schoolhouse.

Diphtheria broke out in 1879. The J.S. Boardman family lost four children, as did the C.C. Clark family. The Ephraim Boardmans lost two. When it finished, only one student was left in school district one.

In 1880 the Wisconsin Central Railroad reached Thorp from Abbotsford. The little community had been called &quot;North Fork&quot;, but the railroad named the station &quot;Thorpe&quot;, and soon shortened it to Thorp. The name honored Joseph G. Thorp, who founded the Eau Claire Lumber Company in 1866 and was a state senator in the 1860s and 1870s.

With the railroad came more growth. L.O. Garrison started a general store. E.A. Boardman opened a post office in his store. In 1881 the Boardmans platted a village of East Thorp, where the business section now is. The railroad had previously platted the west side of town. J.H. Sargent opened the Forest Queen Hotel. And Charles Sheldon and Melvin Nye started a sawmill. In addition to businesses already mentioned, the town also had a saloon, a blacksmith, and five homes.

The First Baptist Church formed in 1882, with the Methodist Episcopal soon after, and St. Bernard&#x27;s Catholic parish soon after. The first newspaper, the &quot;Pioneer&quot;, began publishing in 1883, and soon was reorganized into the &quot;Courier&quot;. That same year the school district built a second building, with four rooms.

Polish immigrants began to arrive in the Thorp area in the late 1880s. By then much of the timber there was cut off, leaving this cutover land reduced to stumps and brush. This land was cheap, holding promise for hard-working new arrivals. The Poles concentrated east of Thorp and built their own wooden Catholic church in 1891, naming it St Hedwig&#x27;s for Polish noblewoman Hedwig of Silesia. By 1904 their numbers had increased enough to replace the wooden church with the huge brick church that stands today. Many of these immigrants came from the area around Poznań, and they built a school called the Poznan School.

By 1894, major businesses in town were Nye, Lusk and Hudson&#x27;s Saw Mill and Lumber Yard, the E.A. Boardman Saw Mill and Lumber Yard, and J.W. Cirkel &amp; Sons Stave and Heading Works - a barrel-making factory.

The community of Thorp voted to incorporate as a village in 1893. The population was 837 by this time, and the reasons listed for incorporating included the need for a peace officer and jail to reduce the drunken brawls and disorderliness and bad language in the streets, the cattle and pigs running loose, the manure and filth in the streets, and the need for fire suppression. Addressing some of those concerns, the following year the new village installed a waterworks system with ten fire hydrants around town, and organized a hose company. An electric light plant was installed in 1901, a volunteer fire department in 1902, and a public sewer system in 1914.

The Thorp Telephone Company was organized as a private business in 1904, with fifty phones connected and Miss Allie Bruno manually making the first connections at a magneto switchboard in a building behind the Connor saloon.

Farming and dairying prospered on the cutover land as logging wound down in the early 1900s. Thorp Dairy Co. opened its first creamery in 1907 and by 1917 had five others operating in the area. The Big Four canning factory started in the 1920s and failed. Thorp Finance Co. started in 1924. The Women&#x27;s Union Club built a library in 1926.

During the Great Depression in the 1930s the People&#x27;s Exchange Bank closed, and many locals lost their savings. Farm values plummeted and some lost their farms. But some of the Polish immigrants never did trust banks, so didn&#x27;t lose their savings. Expansion of Blue Moon Foods in 1939 helped raise wages and helped the village out of the depression.

In 1948 Thorp was incorporated into a city. The following year polio broke out, and various activities were cancelled to slow its spread.

Thorp&#x27;s public swimming pool was built from 1955 to 1957, spurred by donations from Thorp Finance and guided by the Thorp Lions. The rural schools were consolidated around 1960, finally pushing the district to build a new high school in 1963.

<text>Withee is a village in Clark County in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 487 at the 2010 census. The village is located mostly within the Town of Hixon, with a small portion extending south into the Town of Longwood.

==History==
James S. Boardman was the first settler in Withee, arriving in 1870. George Richards and David R. Goodwin arrived shortly after. A post office named &quot;Winneoka&quot; was established there in 1874 at the farm of Bernard Brown, who also sold small supplies. Before that, both mail and supplies had been hauled from Greenwood and Chippewa Falls.

In 1880 the Wisconsin Central Railroad built the line through Withee connecting Abbotsford to Chippewa Falls. The initial village of Withee was platted the following year, named for Niran Withee, a Maine schoolteacher, La Crosse lumberman, and Wisconsin legislator. With the railroad came fast growth. E.A. Eaton built Withee&#x27;s first store in 1881, then sold it to W.S. Tufts, who ran the post office there. Then William Valiquette added a saloon. Another general store soon followed, a grocery and confectionery, a hotel, a blacksmith, another saloon, and a lumber yard. The first one-room school was built in 1883. A four-room school was added in 1890. By 1890, a stage line ran north out of Neillsville, through Christie, Greenwood, and Longwood, connecting with the railroad at Withee.

In 1893, attracted by Spaulding Company&#x27;s offer of land for a church, a Danish Lutheran minister from Chicago, a follower of N. F. S. Grundtvig, moved with a few families into the Town of Hixon, north of Withee, to form a Danish community and church. Other Danes joined them from around the state, and by 1896 the congregation included thirty families. The Danish language was spoken, and in 1913 the community even hired a teacher of Danish folk-dancing and gymnastics. Gradually the Danish community blended with the surrounding English speakers, but Nazareth Lutheran church remains.

Withee incorporated as a village in 1901, and was the shipping point for D.J. Spaulding Mills of Owen through the Soo Line Railroad. Electricity became available in the village in 1902, provided by the Paul A. Paulsen mill. Most living outside the village went without electicity for another 35 years, when electric lines were finally put up about 1937 by the new Clark Electric Cooperative, funded by a loan from the New Deal Rural Electrification Administration. The village water system was installed in 1907 and a volunteer fire department was established in 1908. The 1906 plat map shows the depot, post office, and a church in the original plat between Division and Pine streets. By then other plats had been added east of Division Street, holding the school, two more churches, a hall, and the State Bank of Withee.

Today, Withee is largely a farming community located one mile from the town of Owen. It includes one gas station, 5 churches, a post office and pharmacy, as well as a few smaller shops. Although the Village of Withee and the City of Owen are separate municipalities, they operate and communicate as one large community, even sharing the same elementary and high school, the Owen-Withee school district.

==Geography==

Withee is located at (44.955168, -90.598908).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

<text>Columbus is a city in Columbia and Dodge counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 5,540 at the 2020 census, all of which resided in Columbia County. Columbus is located about northeast of Madison on the Crawfish River. It is part of the Madison metropolitan area. Nearly all of the city is located within the town of Columbus in Columbia County, though a small portion lies within the town of Elba in Dodge County.

==History==

H. A. Whitney, a Yankee peddler from Vermont, moved to Columbus in 1845 and constructed the first wood frame store building in the community on the land where the Whitney now stands. The building served as a combination store/tavern/rooming house and post office, with Whitney as the first postmaster. In 1857, the building burned down and was replaced by the current Whitney Hotel in 1858. This cream brick, Italianate-style hotel&#x27;s third floor ballroom was heated by six wood-burning stoves. The local newspaper reported on a ball there in 1863, &quot;if you ever hear of a ball by Fuller, ask no questions, but go at once, and enjoy yourselves, and for one night forget the &#x27;fear of the draft&#x27;&quot;.

During the 1880s, The Whitney hosted traveling health practitioners whose expertise ranged from &quot;delivering a 40-foot long tape worm&quot; to a local couple to curing piles. Near the turn of the 20th century, the ballroom was turned into an apartment, and from then on served as commercial, professional, and apartment space.

In the 1950s, a restaurant and bar occupied the first floor of the building. From the 1960s to the present, a succession of owners occupied the building and maintenance was deferred. In the 1950s, the building fell into disrepair and as a result of its continued decline, faced demolition in 1990. In February 1991, Heartland Properties, Inc. helped local citizens create the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation (CDDC), which served as the developer to restore the Whitney. 
Today, the Whitney provides affordable housing for eight households and 1,570 square feet of downtown retail space for local businesses, including the &quot;Daily Citizen&quot; newspaper.

<doc id="260346" wikidata="Q4317360" url="?curid=260346" title="Neposedy">
<text>Neposedy (; ) is a children&#x27;s music group formed in Moscow, Russia in 1991 by Elena Pindzhoyan and later supported by Yuri Nikolaev. Although starting out with a group of 15 children that rotated per performance, the group later did not have a fixed membership and hundreds of children have been estimated to have been part of Neposedy at some stage during its history.

==History==
Neposedy was founded by then 22-year-old Elena Pindzhoyan as a children&#x27;s club at Moscow&#x27;s Leningrad district&#x27;s local Pioneers Palace, focusing on children&#x27;s music. Initially, Neposedy was founded as Pindzhoyan&#x27;s graduation project at the Moscow State Art and Cultural University. Among the first members of Neposedy were 3-year-old Anna Topalova and her older brother Vlad Topalov, Vsevolod Polishchuk, Yulya and Alyona Malinovskaya, Evgeniya Tremasova, Kseniya Tremasova, Mari Suare and Evgeniya Letichevskaya. 

In 1992, the group received nationwide recognition as one of the regular and most successful participants in the television programme &quot;Morning Star&quot;. Not much later, Sergey Lazarev, Anastasiya Zadorozhnaya, Lena Katina and Julia Volkova started appearing as part the group as well. The group appeared regularly in &quot;Morning Star&quot; until 1997, as the group was likened by the show&#x27;s host Yuri Nikolaev. 

Since 2002, Neposedy also incorporated musical theatre for children into their studio. In 2006, the group released a CD titled &quot;We are 15 years!&quot;, a celebration of the group&#x27;s 15 year anniversary, including a cover of Jessica Simpson&#x27;s song &quot;Irresistible&quot;.

In 2016, the group celebrated its 25th anniversary, giving a large concert. The concert was titled &quot;Nas ne dogonyat&quot;, after the epyonous t.A.T.u. single and was later broadcast by Channel One Russia. In this concert, several current and past Neposedy members appeared, including Volkova, Katina and Topalov.

==Past members==
Among its first members, Neposedy knew several young singers that later became successful artists in Russia. Julia Volkova and Lena Katina initially formed the duo t.A.T.u., receiving worldwide fame with singles as &quot;All The Things She Said&quot; and &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot;. Vlad Topalov and Sergey Lazarev attained commercial success as part of Smash!!. Bulgarian-Russian singer Kristian Kostov has been part of Neposedy.

<text>Lodi ( ) is a city in Columbia County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 3,189 at the 2020 census. Lodi is part of the Madison metropolitan area.

==History==
The scenic Town of Lodi area had long been a home of Native Americans before the first settlers, Marston and George Bartholomew, arrived in 1845 and staked their claim. By 1846 a county government was established which created Pleasant Valley Precinct. The Town of Lodi was created in 1849.
Isaac Palmer founded the village of Lodi in 1846 in what was then the Pleasant Valley Precinct of the Wisconsin Territory. He named it after Lodi, in Italy. Palmer chose this glaciated valley as the location for the village because of its water power potential. Spring Creek powered a sawmill that year and a grist mill followed in 1850.

==Susie the Duck==
Susie the Duck has been the town&#x27;s official mascot since 1948. On Wisconsin Highway 113 in downtown Lodi is a small creek-side park where visitors can buy dried corn from vending machines to feed the wild ducks. In this area is a small stone basket, inscribed with the name of former Lodi resident Engle Knerzer, and every year a duck builds a nest there. When the first mallard settled in that location in 1948, it was nicknamed &quot;Susie&quot; by the granddaughter of the police chief.

There is an annual &quot;Susie the Duck Day&quot; celebration, the highlight of which is the rubber duck race. Participants pay a fee for a small rubber duck. The thousands of ducks are then dumped into the creek where they &quot;race&quot; toward a finish line and prizes are awarded based on order of finish. The day&#x27;s celebrations also include a parade, activities in Goeres Park, brat stands on Main Street and in Goeres Park, and a beer garden in the park.

It begins at the Robertson Trailhead, south of Lodi on Lodi-Springfield Road off of Hwy. 60 West. Several other segments of the trail are located in or near Lodi, including a 1.3-mile segment on the corner of Lovering and Highway J and a 21-mile section north of the Colsac III Ferry on Lake Wisconsin.

==Transportation==
===Major highways===
*Wisconsin Highway 60 - heads west to Prairie du Sac and Sauk City; east to I-39/90/94, Arlington, and Columbus
*Wisconsin Highway 113 - heads south to Dane and Waunakee; north to Lake Wisconsin, the Merrimac Ferry, and Baraboo. Serves as the city&#x27;s Main Street.

===Airport===
The Lodi Lakeland Airport (FAA ID 9WN5) is a publicly owned general aviation airport north of the city center. The airport is owned by the town of Lodi and operated by a local organization.

===Railroad===
A Wisconsin and Southern (reporting mark WSOR) railroad line runs through town en route north to Baraboo and Reedsburg and south to Dane, Waunakee, and Madison.

This section of railroad was formerly the CNW mainline, reached Lodi in 1872 and was fully completed in 1873, and linked Milwaukee and Fond Du Lac, with intercity travel provided in the towns in between by C&amp;NW. Two sets of tracks were originally built, although only one remains today in most locations along this line. It was then briefly owned by Union Pacific Railroad after it merged with CNW in 1995, and a lease was signed in 1996 by Wisconsin and Southern for rights to this trackage included in a Madison-area ex-C&amp;NW trackage deal. The line now runs through Lodi from Madison to Reedsburg, and trains that run along it are recognized as L463. Ex-Union Pacific and ex-Burlington Northern units that now belong to WSOR still occasionally run in the area, although most have been repainted.

During the line&#x27;s early days, Lodi had a depot where trains could refill with water, fuel, receive and deport cargo and passengers, and send telegraphs. The depot and adjacent feed mill have long been demolished, but its foundation and platform still remains between the Church Street grade crossing and the Sauk Street grade crossing, and a barren lot remains where they once stood. The Lodi Canning Company is still capable of cargo shipments consisting mainly of canned vegetables and plant products. The plant&#x27;s siding has been seen storing track maintenance equipment such as tamping machines and rolling stock.

<text>Prairie du Chien ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Crawford County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 5,506 at the 2020 census. Often called Wisconsin&#x27;s second-oldest city, Prairie du Chien was established as a European settlement by French voyageurs in the late 17th century. Its settlement date of June 17, 1673, makes it the fourth colonial settlement by European settlers in the Midwestern United States, after Green Bay, Wisconsin, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and St. Ignace, Michigan. The city has many sites showing its rich history in the region.

Prairie du Chien is near the confluence of the Wisconsin and Mississippi rivers, a strategic point along the Fox-Wisconsin Waterway that connects the Great Lakes with the Mississippi. This location offered early French missionaries and explorers their first access and entrance to the Mississippi River. Early French visitors to the site found it occupied by a group of Fox Indians led by a chief whose name &quot;Alim&quot; meant &quot;chien&quot; in French (&#x27;dog&#x27; in English). The French explorers named the location &quot;Prairie du Chien&quot;, French for &#x27;dog&#x27;s meadow&#x27;. Originally this name applied only to the plain upon which the settlement lay, but it was later applied to the city as well. The city of Prairie du Chien is between the town of Prairie du Chien and the town of Bridgeport.

==History==
The first known Europeans to reach Prairie du Chien were French explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet, who arrived by canoe on June 17, 1673, discovering a route to the Mississippi River. Later travel between Canada and the Mississippi River continued to pass through Prairie du Chien, although routes via the Illinois River were also used. In 1685, the French explorer Nicolas Perrot established a trading post in the area as part of the large and lucrative French fur trade industry. After John Jacob Astor&#x27;s machinations had closed the entire government fur trade factory system and the federal factory established in Prairie du Chien in 1815, the American Fur Company became established in the area and later built the Astor Fur Warehouse, an important building in the regional fur trade, which was centered in Prairie du Chien. Prairie du Chien&#x27;s significance as a center of the fur trade did not diminish until the mid-19th century, when European demand declined, as did game stock.

In 1763, after Great Britain defeated France in the French and Indian War (part of the Seven Years&#x27; War), it took possession of the French territory in North America east of the Mississippi River, including Prairie du Chien. During the American Revolutionary War, the city was used as a meeting point for British troops and their Native American allies. After the American victory, the Treaty of Paris granted the area to the new United States of America, but the British and their Loyalists were slow to withdraw. Only after the War of 1812 did the city become fully American.

The U.S. was slow to present any authority over Prairie du Chien, but late in the War of 1812, when the government realized the importance of holding the site to prevent British attacks from Canada, it began construction of Fort Shelby in 1814. In July, British soldiers captured the fort during the Siege of Prairie du Chien. The British maintained control over the city until the war&#x27;s end in 1815. Not wanting another invasion through Prairie du Chien, the Americans constructed Fort Crawford in 1816.
The fort was the site of the negotiations and signing of the Treaties of Prairie du Chien (1825 and 1830), by which the Fox and Sauk ceded much of their land to the U.S. Representing them along with the United Nations of the Chippewa, Odawa and Pottawatomie in the 1829 negotiations was Billy Caldwell, of Scots-Irish and Mohawk descent. He became involved with the Pottawatomie after moving as a young man to the U.S. from Canada.

In 1829, the army doctor William Beaumont carried out many experiments on digestion in the hospital at Fort Crawford. Beaumont&#x27;s discoveries are still the basis of current knowledge of the human digestive process.

Colonel Zachary Taylor, who later became the 12th U.S. president, was the commanding officer at Fort Crawford during the Black Hawk War of 1832. Taylor oversaw the surrender of Black Hawk in Prairie du Chien. Lieutenant Jefferson Davis, who later became president of the Confederate States of America, was stationed at Fort Crawford at the same time. There, Davis met Taylor&#x27;s daughter, Sarah &quot;Knoxie&quot; Taylor, whom he married in 1835.

Outside the fort&#x27;s walls, early-19th-century life in Prairie du Chien was still dominated by the fur trade. Prairie du Chien&#x27;s best-known traders during this time were Michel Brisbois, Joseph Rolette, Nathan Myrick, and Hercules L. Dousman. Dousman built a fortune in the fur trade, which, combined with income from investments in land, steamboats, and railroads, propelled him to become Wisconsin&#x27;s first millionaire. He died in 1868, and his son, H. Louis Dousman, inherited much of his fortune. In 1870, Louis Dousman used his inheritance to construct a luxurious Victorian mansion at the site of the former Fort Shelby. When he died unexpectedly in 1886, his family renamed the home &quot;Villa Louis&quot; in his memory. The Dousman family continued to occupy the home until 1913. In 1952, the mansion became Wisconsin&#x27;s first state-operated historic site.

After the fur trade declined in the mid-19th century, Prairie du Chien&#x27;s attention shifted to agriculture and the railroad. Although the city was first connected to the Milwaukee &amp; Mississippi Railroad in 1857, the width of the Mississippi River posed a challenge for further expansion of the railroad into Iowa. This problem was temporarily solved by disassembling the trains at Prairie du Chien and ferrying them across the river to be put back on the tracks on the other side. A better solution was found by Michael Spettel and John Lawler, who designed the permanent Pile-Pontoon Railroad Bridge to span the river in 1874. Lawler took most of the credit for this invention, and made a small fortune through its operation. The bridge remained in use until its removal in 1961.

Lawler later donated property to establish two Catholic boarding schools in Prairie du Chien, St. Mary&#x27;s Institute (now Mount Mary College of Milwaukee) and Campion High School in the later part of the century. St. Mary&#x27;s College remained in Prairie du Chien until 1928. Campion High School produced several notable alumni, including Vicente Fox, Congressman Leo Ryan, Governor Patrick Lucey, actors David Doyle, George Wendt, and Kevin McCarthy, and writer Garry Wills. It closed in 1975.

===History of municipal government===
Prairie du Chien was incorporated as the &quot;Borough of Prairie des Chiens&quot; on September 17, 1821, by the secretary of the Michigan Territory. It is the only municipality in Wisconsin other than Green Bay to have been known as a borough, rather than a city, town, or village. The borough existed for a few years before the government stopped operating in 1825.

In 1828, the Prairie du Chien area became a part of the Town of St. Anthony, which included all of Crawford County. (Crawford County itself included all of the western part of Michigan Territory.) In 1849, the Town of Prairie du Chien was created, consisting of most of present-day Crawford County. The city of Prairie du Chien was incorporated in 1872.

==Geography==
Prairie du Chien is in the Mississippi River Valley, upon a long triangular plain bounded on the west by the Mississippi River, on the south by the Wisconsin River, and on the east-northeast by a series of tall bluffs. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water. The city&#x27;s area encompasses most of the plain upon which it sits, but portions of the plain extend outside city limits. Just north of the city limits, where the plain forms part of the Town of Prairie du Chien, is a small unincorporated settlement known locally as Frenchtown. The plain also extends outside the city southward into Bridgeport. Here the plain ends, becoming the wetlands of the Wisconsin River delta.

Both inside and outside the city limits, backwaters of the Mississippi River occasionally break across the far west side of the plain to form small islands. Most of these islands are too small and flood-prone to have ever been inhabited, but one just west of downtown Prairie du Chien formed the city&#x27;s fourth ward until a 1965 flood prompted its residents&#x27; mandatory relocation to higher ground. During the relocation project, most buildings with no special historical significance were removed. Now called St. Feriole Island, the island serves as a city park.

=== Climate ===
Prairie du Chien has recorded Wisconsin&#x27;s highest temperatures for January, March, May, September, and November.

==Economy==
Aside from its somewhat larger-than-average tourist trade, Prairie du Chien&#x27;s economy is similar to most other Midwestern cities of its size. Retail, service, and manufacturing jobs employ most of the city&#x27;s residents. Major employers include 3M and Cabela&#x27;s. State and local government are also major employers, as the city is the site of the Crawford County courthouse and offices, as well as a state penitentiary. Prairie du Chien has one of Wisconsin&#x27;s busiest ports on the Mississippi River. Two railroads and a two-runway municipal airport make the city a transport and shipping hub for the area.

==Arts and culture==
Prairie du Chien has five National Historic Landmarks and nine sites on the National Register of Historic Places. The five landmarks were the first designated in the state.

It is close to Wyalusing State Park in Wisconsin, and Effigy Mounds National Monument and Pikes Peak State Park in Iowa, sites of natural and manmade wonders. Its rich history and location by the Mississippi River make it a popular tourist destination. The Prairie Villa &quot;Rendezvous&quot;, a gathering to recreate the atmosphere of a 19th-century fur trading camp, has been held annually in the city every Father&#x27;s Day weekend since 1975, attracting tens of thousands of visitors.

In 2001, Prairie du Chien gained brief national attention for its first annual New Year&#x27;s Eve celebration, during which a carp from the Mississippi River was dropped from a crane over BlackHawk Avenue at midnight. The &quot;Droppin&#x27; of the Carp&quot; celebration has been held every New Year&#x27;s Eve since.

Hunting and fishing have long been popular in the area. The opening of Cabela&#x27;s fourth outlet store in the city in 1998 firmly established the city as a destination for sportsmen.

==Parks and recreation==
The annual seven-day, 500-mile supported bike tour of Wisconsin known as GRABAAWR begins in Eagle River and ends in Prairie du Chien.

<text>The Town of Madison was located in Dane County, Wisconsin, United States. The town ceased to exist on October 31, 2022. Its final population was 6,236 at the 2020 United States census. The majority of the town&#x27;s territory was situated along the Madison Beltline Highway, comprising several neighborhoods situated between the south side of the city of Madison, and the north side of the city of Fitchburg.

The original Town of Madison encompassed approximately , and was organized on February 2, 1846. In 1856 the Wisconsin Legislature chartered the city of Madison, leaving the remainder as the town.

For example, the Burr Oaks neighborhood had an area in the Town of Madison and an area in the City of Madison, connected by Cypress Way. That was the same case with part of the Capitol View Heights neighborhood, connected by Sundstrom and Nygard Streets.

In the wake of continued controversy and an effort in the state legislature to simply abolish the town, an agreement was reached in 2003 to provide for the incorporation of the remaining portions of the town (by then down to less than , including bodies of water) into the city of Madison and the city of Fitchburg on October 31, 2022.

<text>Mazomanie is a village in Dane County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,768 at the 2020 census. The village is located within the Town of Mazomanie. It is part of the Madison Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Mazomanie is located at .

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which, of it is land and is water.

==Etymology==
The land on which rests the town of Mazomanie fell within the hunting grounds of the Hočąk, or Winnebago, Indian nation. About a decade after the Winnebago cession of 1832, there were only a small number of white settlers in the area. The village received its name; many years later, Edward Brodhead explained its derivation: “He (Mazomanie) was an Indian chief in our state and was well known to the old gentleman, H.L. Dousman, who said the Indians pronounced it as though it was spelled Man-zo-ma-nie and the English of it is Iron Horse, which I adopted for the name of a railroad town and also for the name of my horse.” This distinguished chief was Mą́zamąnį́ga, &quot;Iron Walker.&quot;

The Hočągara, who have persisted in the area despite many attempts to eject them, call this town &quot;Mą́zamąnį́,&quot; dropping the suffix &quot;-ga&quot; (a definite article used to indicate a person&#x27;s name). The first syllable of this name is pronounced as Brodhead indicated (&#x27;man&#x27;) since the /ą/ is nasalized. The first element of the name is &quot;mąs&quot;, &quot;iron, metal, ax,&quot; which before a consonant may be softened to &quot;mąza-&quot; or &quot;mąze-&quot;, although the free standing form &quot;mąz&quot; is also known. This is seen in the variant forms &quot;mązara&quot;, &quot;mązera&quot;, &quot;the ax.&quot; In like fashion, in the same sources, we find the names &quot;Mązawįga&quot; or &quot;Mązewįga&quot;, &quot;Iron Woman.&quot; This accounts for the variant name of the chief recorded by Col. John Kinsey as &quot;Mau-zay-mau-nee-kaw&quot; [&quot;Mązemąnįka&quot;]. The second part of the name is formed by the word &quot;mąnį́,&quot; which means &quot;to walk, he walks&quot; — thus &quot;Iron Walker.&quot;

The double meaning of this name has long been appreciated: “The proprietors [of the railroad] have christened it Mazo-Manie, The-Iron-that-Walks, after a somewhat noted Indian chief; and as it is the offspring of an iron way, the name is not inappropriate.” The actual village of Iron Walker was located near Watertown, about 45 miles to the east. Dodsworth, however, adduces considerations that greatly complicate the eponymy of the present day Mazomanie. The town for some time was known as &quot;Mazo Manie,&quot; and recalls in its spelling the name of a pair of Wahpeton Dakota chiefs of that era named &quot;Maz-zo-ma-nee&quot;. The Dakota (Sioux) language is akin to Winnebago, and it may be immediately appreciated that these names are exactly cognate to one another. Both of the Dakota chiefs were known to H.L. Dousman, the aforementioned source of Brodhead&#x27;s information about the Indian names. He also knew the Hočąk chief, having been caught up in the incident that led to that chief&#x27;s notoriety.

It transpired that in October 1836, Iron Walker had shot dead the well-known interpreter Pierre Poquette in an affair of honor. He was initially convicted of murder, but in a second trial was acquitted. Dousman acted as guardian of Poquette&#x27;s orphaned children and petitioned to secure for them a pension. Dodsworth concludes that the town was intended to have been named for the Dakota chief. However, the proper rendering of the Dakota name is &quot;Máza-máni&quot;, lacking the nasalized letter to which Brodhead referred. Furthermore, neither of them was &quot;an Indian chief in our state [Wisconsin],&quot; but were from Minnesota. The real attraction of the spelling and pronunciation now in effect is made clear in a newspaper article of the time: “We are daily asked how to pronounce this beautiful looking name. We have heard various ways, but none that sounded so naturally and well as by accenting the second syllable, thus Ma-zom-anie, the accent as in Menominee. That makes a very pretty thing of it. It is the station on the Mil. &amp; Mis. R. R. 22 miles west of here.” The /o/ in the name is a pure artifact of introducing the Indian name into English, and is found in neither Dakota nor Winnebago. The present rendering of the town&#x27;s name owes to euphony and spelling conventions, none of which invalidates Brodhead&#x27;s attribution of the name to the gunslinging chief of the Hočągara.

==History==

What precipitated the birth of the town was the advent of the Milwaukee and Mississippi Railroad in 1855, which passed through the region to connect Milwaukee with La Crosse. The superintendent of the railroad was Edward Brodhead.

By the nation&#x27;s centennial, Mazomanie had grown to 1,100 people, making it the second largest community in Dane County. Since that time, the village has gained only 350 people, but its small size and slow growth has preserved its nineteenth century character. The village has thirty-four commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places, the best known among these the Mazomanie Railroad Depot which has, with minor changes, remained as it was when it was built in 1857.

<text>Oregon is a village in Dane County, Wisconsin, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 11,179. A suburb south of Madison, it is part of the Madison metropolitan area. The village is located mostly within the Town of Oregon.

==History==

Oregon was settled in 1841 by Bartlet Runey, and the first house was constructed in 1843. Initially the settlement was known as &quot;Rome Corners,&quot; and there is a road south of the village which still bears that name. When the Chicago and North Western Railroad came through the village in 1864, their maps indicated a name of &quot;Oregon,&quot; and the name was adopted. The village was incorporated in 1881. The main railroad line from Chicago to Minneapolis ran through Oregon. From 1880 to 1950 the line was double tracked. Most of the line was abandoned between Evansville and Madison in 1996 but the line was reactivated from Madison to Oregon to serve the Lycon Concrete Plant in 2014.

Many of Oregon&#x27;s historical buildings still stand in the downtown district, including the Netherwood Block on the south, the Badger Cycle Company building and original water tower on the southeast on Janesville Street, and numerous business lining the west side of North and South Main Street. The Red Brick School, one of the more distinguishable structures in the village, built in 1922 as the high school, stands north of downtown. It was recently restored and now serves as the business offices for the Gorman Company.

==Geography==

Oregon is located at (42.923899, −89.382304).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all of it land.

Oregon is served primarily by U.S. Highway 14 (US 14) and Wisconsin Highway 138 (WIS 138) and the two highways meet at the village&#x27;s southeast corner. US-14 previously ran through the village, traveling down North Main Street and then arcing along Janesville Street, but a bypass was constructed from 1976 to 1978 along the northern and eastern sides of the village. The previous route is now signed as County Trunk MM.

The elementary school houses preschool through 4th grade. The middle school houses 5th through 8th grades. The high school houses 9th-12th grades. Enrollment at the elementary has shown an upward trend, and district-wide enrollment has increased slightly over the past several years.

In 2009, community residents passed a referendum authorizing significant facility upgrades to all three school district buildings. Each building added much needed classroom and special use space to accommodate a growing population.

==Churches==
Elk Mound is home to several churches covering a range of denominations.

==Historic Memorial Park==
Mound Hill Park and its attendant &quot;castle&quot; are dedicated to the deceased rural letter carriers of Dunn County. It is believed to be the only such dedicated monument in America.

==Tornado==
In September 2019, The Elk Mound Area and other nearby cities and towns were hit with an EF3 Tornado that damaged quite a bit of Elk Mound, WI. No deaths were reported but houses were unfortunately lost during the tornado. The area got another one the next year, however, that one was much, much weaker, coming in as in EF0.

<text>Menomonie () is a city in and the county seat of Dunn County, Wisconsin, United States. The city&#x27;s population was 16,843 as of the 2020 census.

Named for the original inhabitants of the area, the Menominee, the city forms the core of the United States Census Bureau&#x27;s Menomonie Micropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which includes all of Dunn County (2020 population: 45,440). The Menomonie MSA and the Eau Claire–Chippewa Falls metropolitan area to the east form the Census Bureau&#x27;s Eau Claire-Menomonie Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The city center is at the south end of Lake Menomin, a reservoir on the Red Cedar River.

==History==

The earliest known residents of the area were people from the Trempealeau Hopewell Culture of the Middle Woodland Period (100–400 CE). Evidence from their culture includes a mound from the Wakanda Mounds Group in Wakanda Park, along the western shore of Lake Menomin. Most of these mounds are thought to be from Effigy Mound cultures from this time period. Artifacts from the Late Woodland Period (400–1000 CE) have also been uncovered. It is theorized that agricultural villages supported the population during summer months, transitioning to hunting and gathering from fall through spring. The next known population group is the Santee Dakota in the 1600s and 1700s, who engaged in conflicts with the Ojibwe people, who migrated west as refugees. Armed with European weapons, the Ojibwe pushed westward, eventually winning at the Battle of Kathio in 1770. The two tribes continued their warfare, eventually signing the 1825 First Treaty of Prairie du Chien, which made a border between the two just north of Menomonie, with the Dakota claiming the southern lands.

In 1788, French-Canadian fur trader and schoolmaster Jean Baptiste Perrault established a trading post and fort on the Red Cedar River very near Menomonie.

The lumber industry brought Menomonie permanent settlement and economic prosperity in the 1800s. Hardin Perkins established the first sawmill at the confluence of Wilson Creek and the Red Cedar River in 1822 on behalf of fur traders James H. Lockwood and Joseph Rolette of Prairie du Chien. The mill was washed away by a sudden overflow in the river within a year. Working with Indian Agent General Street, Perkins, Lockwood and Rolette began a legal battle over the authority of the local Native American people to grant permissions of this sort, exchanging land for payment of blankets, beads, whiskey, and other merchandise to Dakota Chief Wapasha II and other Ojibwe chiefs. In 1830 the traders received permission from the federal government to rebuild their lumber operation. This was the first permanent settlement on the land that became the city of Menomonie.

Lockwood built a second mill and dam on the west side of the Red Cedar River, at the confluence of Gilbert Creek. He sold this to Hiram S. Allen, a lumberman from Vermont. In 1839, Allen built a new sawmill in its place, which he sold to the McCann brothers, settlers from Ohio who later became the first permanent residents of Eau Claire. In 1849, the Gilbert Creek Mill became the site of the first post office.

Lockwood and Rolette sold their original operation to James Green in 1841, who turned over the deed to William Black in 1842. In 1846, William Wilson and John Holly Knapp jointly purchased the mill, naming it Black &amp; Knapp Mill. Wilson and his family settled in the area, eventually building what is now the Wilson Place Museum in 1859. Wilson founded the city of Menomonie and became its first mayor in 1882, as well as a Wisconsin State Senator.

Captain Andrew Tainter and Henry L. Stout acquired interest in Wilson and Knapp&#x27;s company, forming Knapp, Stout &amp; Co. in 1853, the company that would come to define the town for generations. Tainter was a silent partner, whose duties included shipping lumber down to the Mississippi River and returning with supplies. By 1873, Knapp, Stout &amp; Co. had become the world&#x27;s largest lumber corporation. In 43 years, its output grew from 100,000 to 5,706,602 feet of lumber. It had 1,200 employees and owned of pine forest. The post office was moved to the site of the Knapp, Stout &amp; Co. Company in 1855, with Wilson as postmaster.

Menomonie was incorporated as a city in 1882.

The Mabel Tainter Memorial Building, a local landmark, was built in 1890 and dedicated on July 3, 1890, by Tainter in honor of his daughter Mabel, who had died in 1886 at the age of 19. In 1891, Wisconsin State Senator James Huff Stout, son of Henry L. Stout, founded a manual training school, the first of several educational enterprises he launched in Menomonie. These educational programs were combined into the Stout Institute in 1908, and still stand as the University of Wisconsin–Stout.

In 1901, the water mill shut down and Knapp, Stout &amp; Co. closed operations in the area. The Wisconsin Power Company and Submerged Electric Motor Co. acquired some of the company&#x27;s facilities, the latter to house the world&#x27;s first outboard motor factory. In 1902, the Wilson-Weber Lumber Company took over retail operations of the Knapp, Stout &amp; Co. That same year, Menomonie founded the nation&#x27;s first agricultural high school, the Dunn County School of Agriculture and Domestic Economy.

Although the identity of the first European to colonize the southern end of Lake Winnebago is uncertain, it was probably Claude-Jean Allouez, followed by French fur trappers. James Doty, a federal judge for the western part of the Michigan Territory, thought the land at the foot of Lake Winnebago might be a good location for a city, so he and his partners bought land in the area.
